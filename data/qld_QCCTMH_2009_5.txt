REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
Leisure Management Ltd (“the respondent”) claims, in an application
in the proceeding, that the Tribunal does
not have jurisdiction to hear and
determine the application commenced by certain residents of Nestle Inn Tourist
Park listed in the
document attached to the application (“the
applicants”) filed on the 13 November 2008.
respondent is the owner and operator of the Nestle Inn Tourist Park located at
905 Manly Road, Tingalpa (“the park”).
The eighteen (18) persons who were the original applicants owned manufactured
the park and first occupied
pursuant to oral site agreements. Four (4) of these persons have ceased to be
applicants, leaving fourteen
(14) remaining applicants.
1 June 2008, the respondent served a notice of a site rent increase to all the
site rental agreements were in
operation the notice was purportedly issued pursuant to
Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003
to the notice the site rents varied from $98.00 to $140.00 per week. The
proposed rental increase varied for each tenant, so
that the new site rent was
equal for each tenant at $170.00 per week prior to any discount.
notice stated:
“Dear Tenant,
Dependent on the length of time you have been a resident you may or may
not realise that rents have not been changed for three years
for tenants that
have been in residence for that period or longer.
In the open market housing costs have significantly risen in that period,
consequently rent costs have also dramatically risen. In
addition, labour and
materials along with service fees etc. have also risen.
Additionally there have been significant costs involved in remedial and
maintenance costs involved in the upgrading of facilities,
infrastructure and
aesthetics of the park. The park owners have instructed management that rents
for recent residents reflect all
the above items and are taken into
consideration for the longer term residents on the next market review, due in
August of this year.
Also that rent reviews are conducted annually to keep in
pace with ever rising costs and values of the open market place.
Exceptionally high costs over the past three years since the last rent
review has seen a widening of the gap in individual rents
on similar properties
or land areas in the park. Some long term residents have significantly
benefited over the past three year
period by extremely low rent fees.
However, in the interest of fairness and parity some residents will
experience higher rent rise costs than others in the coming
review to obtain a
fair and equitable position for all tenants. A rate of rent has been based on
the amount of land relating to
a tenancy and type of tenancy as it would be in
the present open market place, making the rent difference based on a fairer
than is now in place. This will allow any future rent increases to be
of a similar value for similar properties.
Attached you will find the reviewed rate as pertaining to your particular
tenancy. This rate comes into force on 1 August 2008.
Yours truly
Brian Beynon, Manager”.
The attached document set out the reviewed rent for each tenant. For example,
for site 2C, the document reads:
01/06/08 Rent review – site 2C
Site x $150.00 sewer $5.00 large block manufactured home $15.00
$120.00 per week as of Friday 1 August 2008
Brian Beynon, Manager.
18 July 2008, and by reason of a computer problem, Mr Beynon gave notice that
the increase would not take effect until 1 September
prescribed by
section 71(6)
of the Act.
Negotiations
were entered into between the applicants and the park owner.
In or about July and August 2008 many home owners signed a document agreeing to
pay the increased rental of $170.00 (“the rental
acknowledgment”).
Subsequently, the respondent desired that each home owner enter in a new written
site agreement to replace the earlier oral agreement
and on 1 October 2008
circulated a proposed written site agreement (“the new site
agreement”) containing a rental of
$170.00 per week, with a discount in
some cases.
two home owners executed the rental increase acknowledgment, paid the increased
site rent and executed the new site agreement.
13 November 2008, eighteen (18) home owners filed an application in the Tribunal
(“the application”) and with respect
to these applicants:
(i) Four (4)
have been removed as applicants for one reason or another; one applicant has
changed his mind and signed the new site
agreement, others have vacated the
(ii) Eight (8)
Mr Trott, Mr Stead, Mr Kurbes and
Ms Balitova executed the rental increase
acknowledgment, paid the increase in rent for up to 10 weeks and in some cases
new site agreement. In or about December 2008, these eight home
owners changed their minds and now refuse to pay the increased rental.
(iii) Six (6)
applicants namely Mr Hadden, Mr Lynch, Mr Hulett, Mr Thompson, Mr Armstrong and
Ms Lamont refused to sign the rental
increase acknowledgment and on 11 August
2008 the respondent withdrew the notice.
application expressly states that:
The facts upon which the application is based are set out in the
application and provide:
(i) a site agreement dispute exists in relation to proposed site rent
(ii) the applicants do not have a written agreement but have their homes
position in the park under a relevant agreement;
of the Act requires the increases to be notified in the form
outlined in either
sections 69
of the Act;
(iv) because there is no written agreement showing a method of site rent
variation, notice of site rent increases must be given according
of the Act;
(v) the respondent has not complied with
when notifying site rent
increases.;
(vi) the respondent has denied the applicants’ rights under
of the Act;
(vii) the respondent has used its superior bargaining position to unfairly
cause some applicants to pay increase site rents.
The orders sought are:
(a) that all increases notified since 1 June 2008 be set aside;
(b) that any additional site rent payments made since 1 June 2008 be
(c) the respondent pay the cost of filing the application; and
(d) any other orders the Tribunal considers appropriate.
respondent alleges the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine
this application.

140 Site agreement dispute
If there is a site agreement dispute, either party to the dispute may
apply to the tribunal for an order, and the tribunal may make
any order it
considers appropriate, to resolve the dispute.”
Respondent’s submissions
respect to the six applicants, namely Mr Hadden, Mr Lynch, Mr Hulett, Mr
Thompson, Mr Armstrong and Ms Lamont who refused to
sign the rental increase
acknowledgment and in respect of whom the notice was subsequently withdrawn, the
respondent submitted that
a site agreement dispute does not exist and therefore
the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction.
respect to the eight applicants who signed the rental increase acknowledgment,
subsequently changed their minds and now refuse
to pay the increase, the
respondent submitted that they are bound by the acknowledgment and that they are
in breach by failing to
pay the rental increase. It was submitted the Tribunal
does not have jurisdiction, as the dispute does not involve a
increase but a breach of the new site agreement.
is submitted that by signing the rental increase acknowledgment and paying the
rental increase for ten weeks or so, those eight
(8) applicants have waived or
are estopped from asserting that the notice dated 1 June 2008 does not comply
with section 71 of the
respondent relies on the reasoning in
Vivienne Stallwood v Stanley William
Obrien t/a Pine Ridge Caravan Villages MH 106-06,
a case with very similar
The respondent submitted that Ms Balitova, one of the eight applicants, was
overseas and was not subject to the rental increase and
accordingly no site
dispute exists.
Applicants’ submissions
applicants submit that the initial notice on 1 June 2008 was defective as it
failed to include the matters listed in section 71(2)
of the MHRP Act, including
a failure to prescribe that the
“home owner must, within 28 days after
receiving the notice, give the park owner a written response indicating whether
the home owner agrees to the proposed increase”.
applicants submit that strict compliance is required of section 71, and as the
section has not been complied with, the proposed
site rent increase cannot be
enforced. The applicants submit that the notice was so defective that the new
site agreement is not
applicants rely on five tribunal decisions in support of their submissions,
Valentine v Emmetlow Pty Ltd [2008] CCT MH002-08; Residents of Aussie
Gardens Caravan Park v Samy Jarufe Holdings Pty Ltd [2007] CCT
Residents of Alex Beach Top Tourist Park v W & T Enterprises (Qld) Pty Ltd
[2005] QCCT MH 19
; Meudell v Teris Pty Ltd
[2005] QCCTMH 14
and Haywood v Surtie
Enterprises Pty Ltd [2005] QCC MH11.
applicants also submit that the validity of the rental acknowledgment agreement
and the new site agreement is a matter that will
be determined at the hearing.
Further, they say the eight (8) residents will tender evidence showing that they
were coerced into
signing the rental increase acknowledgment, and for those who
have done so, the new site agreement. They submit that the Tribunal
dispute pursuant to section 140 of the
Observations and findings

consider the jurisdiction issue, Parts 11 and 20, especially sections 71(6) and
140 of the MHRP Act are to be considered. Section
71(6) concerns a proposed site
rental increase where section 69 does not apply, and provides that
a park owner and a home owner do not agree on the proposed increase within 28
days, the park owner may apply to the tribunal
for an order about the proposed
section does not give the Tribunal jurisdiction to determine the issues raised
in the application by the home owners as only
the park owner may apply for an
order under this provision.
140 provides that if there is a site agreement dispute, either party to the
dispute may apply to the Tribunal for an order,
and the Tribunal may make any
order it considers appropriate to resolve the dispute. A site agreement dispute
is defined in Schedule
2 to mean a dispute between the parties to a site
agreement about the parties’ rights and obligations under the agreement or

their minds are in a different position. They assert that the notice dated 1
June does not comply with the strict
requirements expressed in section 70 (2) of
the MHRP Act and that the respondents used coercion to force them to sign the
increase acknowledgment and in some cases the new site rental
The respondent denies coercion and says that even if the
notice dated 1 July is not compliant those applicants signed the rental increase
acknowledgment, paid the rent increase for 10 weeks or so and have waived the
notice defects or are estopped from asserting a contrary
The respondent relies on a very similar fact situation in

In that case jurisdiction was determined as part of the
To determine the issue of jurisdiction for these eight applicants’
findings of fact will have to be made. These are best made
at the final hearing
with the benefit of evidence from the persons who file witness statements. At
that time submissions could be
made as to the meaning and ambit of section 140
of the MHRP Act as well as with issues of alleged estoppel, waiver, and the
of the rental increase acknowledgment and the new site agreement.
Balitova signed the rental increase acknowledgment before departing for overseas
and has not made any submissions supporting her
position. At this stage, I am
not satisfied that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine
her application.
Mrs Balitova is listed as one of the eight applicants, and she
should remain as an applicant at this stage. The issue of jurisdiction
