CASES REFERRED TO
THE DECISION
Update Construction Pty Ltd v Rozelle Child Care Centre Ltd
20 NSWLR 251
REASONS FOR DECISION
1. BACKGROUND
1.1 On 7 October 2008 the Owners entered into a contract
with the Builder for the construction of a swimming pool at their premises
Manning. Work commenced on 3 November 2008 and the major portion of the work was
completed, but early in 2009 the Owners in a
series of emails expressed their
dissatisfaction with aspects of the pool construction.
1.2 Due to difficulties arising between the parties in being able to make
suitable arrangements, no repairs were effected by the
Builder. However copies
of the reports of engineers for both parties were received and eventually the
matter came on for hearing.
1.3 The matters listed for hearing on the part of the Owners are listed at page
32 of our papers. These were:
Deficiencies
in the skimmer box.
of pool are 50mm lower than the contract details.
on right side of pool have fallen off and others are loose.
Bull-nosing
on right side of pool has become loose.
of pool is light/medium blue when dark blue was ordered.
soak-wells have not been installed although paid
1.4 The matters claimed by the Builder are failure to pay $2,020 of the total
contract price of $33,000 plus one variation of $3,984
and a second variation of
2. EVIDENCE
The Owner stated the
contract was at page 47 and the pool installed on 26 January 2009. The
variations at pages 48 and 49 were not
signed and only received after the pool
was finished. They got confused over what was due and considered that payment of
made by them was correct. The pool had been installed 100mm too low as
shown on page 28 in the City of South Perth plan. The decking
had gone on top of
the alfresco which was concrete. The pool had gone in first then the decking.
The skimmer box does not comply
as the top half does not coincide with the
bottom half. The bull- nosing and tiling have fallen off the top extra height of
which had been added as shown in the Antonelle report at page 93 and as
shown in the photos at pages 96 and
97. As to the colour when installed it was mixed with white and is a medium
blue. They had wanted a really dark blue and were categoric
The colour is streaked.
The Owner stated they would like the pool fixed as per the report of
Structerre at page
176. However Structerre did not comment on the colour and they were prepared
to leave this as it was. They were not sure about the
soak-wells although there
was a plan at page 156.
The Builder said the plan was as per page 28
and was designed by Mrs Edwards. The extra level was non-structural. The level
pool was raised to the same level as the house without a Variation Order
being issued. They had put in the soak-wells to avoid the
house flooding if the
pool should overflow. The extra height of 50mm did not have any weight on it and
the damage which has occurred
could only come about from
heavy blows. A gloss pamphlet had been sent with the contract at page 44.
Cosmic Blue colour was used as ordered. The streakiness
results from lack of
care. They had used Bondwell with a 30% cement content. With the overflow
possibility, they had installed two
soak-wells on the right-hand side as shown
on page 156. As to the skimmer box the lid does not affect the issue as the
water level
is below the gap and does not rise to it. There is 300mm of tiling
although original quote was based on 200mm. The Builder said he
would follow all
the recommendations of Structerre and would need only two to three days to
complete the work and would need a skip
bin. However the Owners would not let
them into the property. He confirmed that $2,020 was the amount still
In reply the Owner said the top was loose. They
did not know it was non-structural. Their inspector at page 93 had only used a
on one part.
3. ASSESSMENT OF EVIDENCE
3.1 We note that as a result of the evidence both
parties agreed with the Structerre report and this, with the Building Inspector
report, were used for the basis of our assessment. As to each of the claims we
noted as follows:
of pool – Page 49 records that the Owners switched colours to Cosmic Blue
with 50% quartz. The Owners picked the colour
direct with the manufacturer and
the only evidence given was that the colour was indeed Cosmic Blue, and no claim
has been proved.
Counterclaims
for costs – There were four quotations with costs of repairs ranging from
$21,154 to $24,534. These were far in
excess of a reasonable cost for the work
required and appeared to cover every possible aspect of the work other than the
a new shell itself. None of the persons involved gave any evidence.
Accordingly the Tribunal was left to assess a reasonable cost
based upon the
reports of the Inspector of the Builders Registration Board and of
Structerre.
was noted that Structerre had stated that repairs had taken place at the time of
its inspection and at the last paragraph of item
3 said, “Remaining damage
was limited to a single tile missing from the western wall of the pool
(approximately 2 metres south
of the skimmer box) and a single loose coping
paver at the re-entrant corner adjacent to the steps”. No evidence was
of these repairs or of the cost.
was claimed that the glass fence required removal. This is not so as the extra
100mm of edging can be removed and reconstructed
without affecting the fence.
However if any length was to be removed only 14 metres (not 16 metres) need be
removed and reinstalled
as the pool fence is not part of the pool – see
photographs on page 95.
water does not need to be removed from the pool as all work is required above
the water line. The pool filter can be kept running
keep the site clean requires plastic sheeting and the removal of a minor
quantity of cement rubble and other debris.
3.2 Accordingly the costs were assessed as follows:
Purchase of 14 metres of capping
Lay capping – labour
Remove existing capping (4 man hours @ $50 per hour)
Labour to replace concrete (2 men for 1 day = 16 hours @ $50 per
Cost of Readymix concrete
Purchase mosaic tiles and lay
Remove rubble and plastic cover used to protect site
Steel pinning
Contingencies including repair of crack, extra cost of running filter, and
provision of a pool cover
Amount owed to the Owners
3.3 The Owners disputed that they had signed the Variation Orders. However they
had allowed the work to be done and said that they
had paid more than the
original $33,000 for which they had signed up on the original contract. The
Builder under the contract therefore
was owed $38,004. The Owners claimed to
have paid $36,147. We accepted their statement and this left a balance of
$1,857. The Builder
claimed they had paid only $35,984. However no receipts were
produced in evidence to verify the figures. In law where the extra work
within the terms of the agreement, then the Owner is estopped from relying upon
the absence of any written agreement to do
the work – see Update
Construction Pty Ltd v Rozelle Child Care Centre Ltd
(1990) 20 NSWLR
Accordingly the Orders are that the Builder pay the
Owners the sum of $3,982 less the amount owed on the contract of $1,857 leaving
a balance of $2,125.
