Response from State Growth dated 28 January 2025.
In the report of your findings, you made two recommendations relating to the regulation of quad bikes and UTVs:
* That the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute and the Attorney-General consider introducing legislation requiring mandatory training and
licensing of all persons using quad bikes and UTVs; and
* That consideration be given to including UTVs in the provisions of the Road Rules that apply to quad bikes, or separately providing
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles (Registrar) is responsible for driver licensing and vehicle registration, and the Department of State
Growth has responsibility for administering relevant legislation, including the
Road Rules 2019
. For these reasons, this department has an interest in your recommendations and considered it appropriate to respond.
Statistics indicate a significant increase in the registration of ATVs and quad bikes in Tasmania, with a 65 per cent rise from 2014
to 2024. This does not capture unregistered vehicles, noting that vehicles used solely on property that is not a public street do
not have to be registered. Fatalities on private property are not captured in official statistics and can only be confirmed by the
Coronial Division or Tasmania Police.
At this time there is no legislative provision that provides for the Registrar to impose restrictions on UTVs not operated on public
streets and we note that the
do not apply to such operation. However, where they have the power to do so via the statutory licensing and registration framework,
the Registrar has taken a number of steps to regulate the operation of these vehicles when used on public streets.
The importation of motor vehicles, including UTVs and quad bikes, into Australia is governed by the
Road Vehicle Standards Act 2018
(Cth) (RVSA). Under the RVSA, UTVs and quad bikes are not considered road vehicles and are therefore not required to comply with
the Australian Design Rules (ADRs) for importation. As such, they are considered a non-compliant vehicle for registration purposes.
In Tasmania, the regulation of vehicle operation, registration, and driver licensing falls under the
Traffic Act 1925
Vehicle and Traffic Act 1999
. UTVs and quad bikes are classified as motor vehicles under these Acts and must be registered and operated by licensed drivers on
public streets.
It is an offence to operate an unregistered vehicle on public streets. The Registrar may approve the registration of non-compliant
vehicles, subject to conditions, and does so routinely in respect to the registration of quad bikes and UTVs.
The minimum driver licence required is a car licence, as these vehicles are not motorcycles and have a Gross Vehicle Mass (GVM) of
less than 4.5 tonnes. As such, drivers cannot be under 16 years of age, which is the minimum age at which a person can obtain a car
learner licence. It is standard practice for the Registrar to apply a condition to the registration of these types of vehicles requiring
the operator to hold a current provisional or full driver car licence, which would mean the operator must be at least 17 years of
age, the statutory minimum age for obtaining a provisional licence.
Road Rules 2019
mandate the use of helmets for quad bike riders but not for UTV operators. However, conditional registration for this vehicle type
requires motorcycle helmets to be worn.
Seatbelts are not required for UTVs or quad bikes, as they are not prescribed by the
Vehicle and Traffic (Vehicle Standards) Regulations 2024
