Tribunal quotes from Dr Kelly’s
her involvement in the incident which occurred in 2016
was not influenced by any psychiatric or addiction medicine
Tribunal has also had regard to the sentencing remarks of
Judge Costello:–
Your cavalier, arguably callous, disregard for your
victim’s welfare is rightly to be deprecated.
Furthermore, whilst your role in kidnapping was far less serious than that of
others, you nevertheless facilitated its continuation
by permitting them to
remain in a house in relation to which you were lawfully able to demand that
they leave.
Even at this level your crime is still very serious. A
continuation of your inaction, combined with your victim’s continued
detention, had the very real potential for the situation to escalate and get out
of hand to the point where the consequences for
Ms MJ could arguably have become
far more serious. As such your offending warrants a term of imprisonment.

the medical and other needs of her parents. Ms
Gaffney also told us that she was

paragraph 41:
The purpose of disciplinary proceedings is to protect
the public, not to punish a practitioner in the sense in which punishment is
administered pursuant to the criminal law. A disciplinary tribunal protects the
public by making orders which will secure the maintenance
of proper professional
standards. A disciplinary tribunal will also consider the protection of the
public, and of the relevant profession,
by making orders which will assure the
public that appropriate standards are being maintained within the relevant
profession.
