_____________________________________________________________________
The Complainant was an employee of the Respondent (Complainant A). Due to
resourcing issues in 2004, Complainant A often used her
own lap-top computer
which she would work on during the day, and at home after hours. In 2004
Complainant A became seriously ill
and left the workplace, not returning for
some time. The Respondent asked Complainant A if specific work files could be
copied from
her lap-top to the Respondent’s system to which she agreed.
Complainant A became aware that the Respondent had not only copied work
related files from the lap-top, but that it had also copied
the entire contents
of the computer including personal information of both herself and her husband
– Complainant B.
The Complainants wrote to the Respondent in 2004 complaining about the
collection of personal information. The Respondent replied
expressing regret
that the personal information had been collected, but assured the
Complainants’ that their personal information
had since been deleted from
the Respondent’s files.
In April 2007 the Complainants became aware that their personal information
had in fact not been deleted from all of the Respondent’s
files, and was
available to view by those who had access to a particular stand-alone computer.
Following contact again with the Respondent,
all personal information was then
deleted from that remaining computer.
The Complainants subsequently complained to the Victorian Privacy
Commissioner as the Respondent initially failed to adequately delete
personal information, and they were dissatisfied with the Respondent’s
handling of their complaint.
The Complainants alleged that the transfer of their personal
information stored within their lap-top to the Respondent’s system
2004) was a collection of personal information that was not necessary for the
Respondent’s functions or activities.
The Complainants also alleged that by storing their personal
information on a (password protected) computer that was readily accessible
number of its staff, the Respondent allowed the Complainants’ personal
information to be used and disclosed for a purpose
unrelated to the primary
purpose of collection or a permitted secondary purpose.
The Complainants further alleged that by storing their
personal information on its computer, the Respondent failed to secure their
personal information from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure by
other staff that had access to it.
Response to the complaint
The Respondent sought to have the complaints declined on the basis that it
had been more than 45 days after the Complainants became
aware of the act or
practice (29(1)(d)) and / or that the complaint had been the subject of an
investigation by the Ombudsman in
2008 which they believed had adequately dealt
with the matter under that other enactment (29(1)(f)). Further, the Respondent
of the view that because “there was no intent to breach the
entertained.
The Privacy Commissioner decided not to decline to entertain the complaint
under section 29(1)(f) because the investigation conducted
by the Victorian
Ombudsman concerned the administrative actions of the Respondent following the
complaint, rather than the alleged
breaches of the Complainants’
In considering whether to decline to entertain the complaints on the basis
that it was more than 45 days after the Complainants became
aware of the act or
practice (29(1)(d)), the Privacy Commissioner considered whether the
Complainants would be satisfied with this
decision, or whether it was likely
they would refer the matter to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal
(VCAT). Given the
Victorian Privacy Commissioner’s primary function in
relation to complaints is to try to resolve them, and the protracted period
time in which the Complainants and Respondent had been in dispute, it was
decided to attempt conciliation in order to assist the
parties to resolve their
longstanding dispute and avoid further litigation.
In regard to the
Respondent’s position that the complaints should be declined on the basis
that there was no intent to breach
the Complainants’ privacy, it was
explained to the Respondents that intent was not a relevant factor in deciding
not a complaint should be declined.
As a result, the complaint was referred to conciliation.
Both the Complainants and Respondent representatives attended the
conciliation in a positive and enthusiastic manner. Thanks largely
constructive, empathetic and sensitive attitude of the Respondent’s
representatives, and the flexible and amenable attitude
of the Complainants, an
outcome was reached to the satisfaction of both parties.
