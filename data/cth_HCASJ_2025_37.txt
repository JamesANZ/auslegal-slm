In the matter of an application by Stephen Groom for leave to issue or file [2025] HCASJ 37 (3 October 2025)
HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA
IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION BY STEPHEN GROOM FOR LEAVE TO ISSUE
[2025] HCASJ 37
Date of Judgment: 3 October
A19 of 2025
application for leave to issue or file an application for a constitutional or
other writ directed to the Attorney-General for
the State of South Australia is
Representation
The applicant is unrepresented
to r 6.07.3 of the
High Court Rules 2004
(Cth) and by application filed
on 25 August 2025, Mr Groom seeks leave to have issued or filed an application
for a constitutional
or other writ directed to the Attorney-General for the
State of South Australia ("the proposed application"). Leave is required because
of a r 6.07.2 direction made by Gordon J on 15 August 2025, directing the
Registrar to refuse to issue or file the proposed application
without first
having and obtaining the leave of a Justice of this Court. The application is
supported by an affidavit of Mr Groom,
also filed on 25 August 2025.
addition to the leave sought, Mr Groom seeks a "[d]irection that the Court may
nominate a suitable respondent, or proceed on the
papers". That direction would
be appropriate only if leave is granted to file the proposed application.
However, for the following
reasons, that leave will be refused. It follows that
the requested direction should not be made.
Relevant principles
discretion to refuse the leave sought is to be exercised by reference to the
criteria set out in r 6.07.1, namely whether the
proposed application "appears
... 'on its face' to be an abuse of the process of the Court, to be frivolous or
vexatious or to fall
outside the jurisdiction of the
Implicit in the
requirement that a document the subject of an application under r 6.07.3 be
considered "on its face" is that such
an application falls to be determined on
the papers, that is, without an oral
Consideration
Groom seeks a variety of relief against the Magistrates Court of South Australia
and the South Australian Attorney-General in
relation to an intervention order
made against him on 19 October 2011 by a magistrate in the Magistrates Court. In
his proposed application,
Mr Groom contends that the order was made without a
valid sworn complaint, contrary to statutory requirements and, accordingly, the
magistrate proceeded without jurisdiction.
Groom identified Ch III of the
Constitution
Judiciary Act 1903
(Cth) as sources for this Court's jurisdiction to
grant relief directed to the Attorney-General. None of these laws confer
upon this Court to grant the relief that Mr Groom seeks in his
proposed application. As the proposed application falls outside the
of this Court, leave must be refused.
