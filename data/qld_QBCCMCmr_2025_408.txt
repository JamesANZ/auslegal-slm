REASONS FOR DECISION
application is about a dog that has been kept by the respondent on Lot 20.
[2] In November
2023 the committee resolved to give the respondent approval to keep a then
9-year-old Boxer named Maggie, subject
to several conditions including about
noise. The approval was communicated to the respondent by letter in December
[3] But the body
corporate says that for over 12 months the dog barked excessively, causing a
persistent nuisance in breach of the
by-laws, and that the respondent failed to
manage the dog’s behaviour. It provides complaints from other residents.
breach notices, conciliation, and intervention attempts have not
resolved the issue.
[4] After this
application was lodged, on 29 July 2025, the committee resolved to rescind the
2023 approval and notified the respondent
of that in writing on 5 August. But
it is unsure if the dog has been removed. It seeks an order to rescind the
approval and for
the dog to be removed.

investigated the dispute, including reviewing the submitted
request, a member of the Commissioner’s office asked the body corporate
whether the dog was still at the scheme.
The body corporate manager advised the
committee could not confirm that and it did not receive a reply from the
respondent when
it asked. It provided a further by-law contravention notice
issued on 15 September asserting the dog was on the lot, and creating
was interfering with others. It sought to continue the application.
[13] The officer
then attempted again to contact the respondent. This time the respondent
verbally advised the dog had been rehomed
in September and they did not
understand what else there was to be done. However, they said they did not want
to make a submission.
Determination
[14] By-law
13 in the CMS for Azure on Double Bay provides for the keeping of animals at the

an occupier must obtain written approval for the committee before bringing,
keeping, or permitting an
invitee to keep any animal on the common property. It

receiving notice from the committee.
respondent had approval to keep a dog in Lot 20. That approval has been
expressly rescinded. The respondent has not challenged
the decision to rescind
approval. Given the apparent circumstances, it is difficult to see why that
decision would not be valid.
As the approval has been rescinded, the respondent
is breaching By-law 20 if they continue to keep the dog at the scheme.
[16] It is not
necessary to consider any past or current evidence of the dog’s behaviour
because, regardless of that, the dog
is no longer approved to be kept at the

this dispute has now been resolved because the dog has left the lot. The
respondent indicates that is the case but
has not said so in writing. If the
dog was still in the lot, it is unclear why the committee would not be aware of
that given the
assertions of ongoing barking. However, given the past
circumstances including the limited communication from the respondent, I
acknowledge there may be some uncertainty for the body corporate. To avoid any
doubt for the parties, I will make an order.
[18] I do not
consider it necessary to make an order to rescind the consent letter from
December 2023 because the body corporate has
already resolved to rescind the
approval. However, if the dog remains at Lot 20, I will order the respondent to
remove it and keep
it removed unless the body corporate passes a new resolution
granting approval for the dog to be kept in Lot 20.
[19] If the dog
has been removed from the scheme, this order should present no difficulty for
the applicant. But if not, the respondent
should be aware that it is an offence
not to comply with an order, and the order can be enforced in the Magistrates
Court if it is
