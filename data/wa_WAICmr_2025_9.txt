Commissioner (

) decided not to identify the
complainant by name to protect the complainant’s privacy.
of decision dated 4 December 2023, the agency refused the complainant access to
the disputed document under clause 8(2)
of Schedule 1 to the FOI Act (
) on the ground the document contains information which was given and
received in confidence. The complainant sought internal review
agency’s decision. By internal review decision dated 22 January 2024, the
agency confirmed the initial decision.
On 21 March 2024, the complainant
applied to the Information Commissioner (
the Commissioner)
for external
review of the agency’s decision. The Commissioner obtained the disputed
document from the agency, together with
the FOI file maintained by the agency in
respect of the access application.
Section 76(1) of the FOI Act provides
that the Commissioner may decide any matter in relation to an access application
have been decided by the agency. On 13 March 2025, the
Commissioner provided the parties with her preliminary view of the matter
preliminary view
). It was the Commissioner’s preliminary view,
based on the information before her, that the disputed document is exempt under
clause 3(1) of Schedule 1 to the FOI Act (
clause 3(1)
). As a result, the
Commissioner did not consider whether the disputed document is also exempt under
clause 8(2) as claimed by the
The complainant did not accept the
Commissioner’s preliminary view and provided further submissions. After
considering all
the material before her, including the disputed document and the
complainant’s further submissions, the A/FOI Deputy Commissioner
that the disputed document was exempt under clause 3(1).
Clause 3(1)
provides that matter is exempt matter if its disclosure would reveal personal
information about an individual (whether
living or dead). Personal information
is exempt under clause 3(1) subject to the application of the limits on the
exemption set
out in clauses 3(2) to 3(6).
The A/FOI Deputy Commissioner
was satisfied that disclosure of the disputed document would reveal personal
information about individuals
and was therefore, on its face, exempt under
clause 3(1).
The A/FOI Deputy Commissioner considered the only relevant
limits on the exemption that may apply to the disputed document were clauses
3(2), 3(3) and 3(6). Clause 3(2) provides that matter is not exempt under
clause 3(1) merely because its disclosure would reveal
personal information
its ordinary meaning of ‘solely’
or ‘no more than’
personal information about the access applicant (
Re Malik and Office of the
Public Sector Standards Commissioner
[2010] WAICmr 25
). The A/FOI
Deputy Commissioner considered that, while the disputed document contains
personal information about the complainant,
this information was inextricably
intertwined with personal information about other individuals. Therefore, the
A/FOI Deputy Commissioner
considered the disclosure of the disputed document
would not merely reveal personal information about the complainant and that the
limit in clause 3(2) did not apply.
Clause 3(3) provides that information
is not exempt merely because its disclosure would reveal ‘prescribed
details’ in
relation to officers or former officers of the agency. The
prescribed details covered by the limit on the exemption include anything
by an officer in the course of performing or purporting to perform their
functions or duties as an officer as described in any
job description for the
position held by that officer:
regulation 9(1)
Freedom of Information
Regulations 1993
The A/FOI Deputy Commissioner considered the
personal information about the officer of the agency, who was the author of the
document, went beyond the officer’s functions and duties as
described in the officer’s job description form. Therefore,
information did not consist of prescribed details. As a result, the A/FOI
Deputy Commissioner considered the limit in clause
3(3) did not
Clause 3(6) provides matter is not exempt under clause 3(1) if its
disclosure would, on balance, be in the public interest. Under
section 102(3),
the onus was on the complainant, as the access applicant, to establish that
disclosure of the disputed document would,
on balance, be in the public
As no restrictions or conditions can be placed upon the release
of documents under the FOI Act, it is well established that disclosure
information under the FOI Act is disclosure to the world at large: see
Transport Authority
[2018] WASC 47
. Accordingly, when considering
whether or not to disclose documents under the FOI Act, the effects of
disclosure are generally considered
as though disclosure were to the world,
rather than only to the particular access applicant.
In favour of disclosure, the A/FOI Deputy Commissioner recognised the public
interest under section 21 of the FOI Act in individuals
accessing their own
personal information held by government agencies. The A/FOI Deputy Commissioner
also recognised that there is
a public interest in individuals who have had
concerns about them raised in the workplace being: informed of those concerns
they have been acted on; given an opportunity to respond, informed of what
action has been taken in respect of the concerns; and
informed of the outcome of
that action. On the information before her, the A/FOI Deputy Commissioner
considered that these public
interests had been satisfied by the information the
agency had provided to the complainant.
Also in favour of disclosure, the A/FOI Deputy
Commissioner considered there is a public interest in the accountability of
for their actions and decisions and in the actions of agencies being as
transparent as possible. The A/FOI Deputy Commissioner was
of the view these
public interests had been satisfied by the information the agency provided to
the complainant and that the public
interest in the accountability of the agency
would not be furthered by the disclosure of the disputed document.
The A/FOI Deputy Commissioner considered whether
procedural fairness required that the complainant be given a copy of the
document such that this is a factor in favour of disclosure. The A/FOI
Deputy Commissioner observed that it is not essential to
procedural fairness
that persons who have allegations made against them receive the actual written
allegations, or other supporting
documents, provided the substance of those
allegations is disclosed:
Re Weygers and Department of Education and
[2007] WAICmr 16.
As the agency had disclosed to the complainant
the substance of the concerns raised in the disputed document, the A/FOI Deputy
Commissioner
considered that procedural fairness did not require the complainant
be given a copy of the disputed document.
Weighing against disclosure of
the disputed document, the A/FOI Deputy Commissioner recognised a strong public
interest in maintaining
personal privacy and noted that this public interest may
only be displaced by some other strong or compelling public interest or
interests that require the disclosure of personal information about one person
to another person.
In balancing the competing public interests, the
A/FOI Deputy Commissioner was of the view that the public interests favouring
of the disputed document were not sufficient to outweigh the strong
public interest in the protection of the personal privacy of
other individuals.
Therefore, the A/FOI Deputy Commissioner was not persuaded that disclosure of
the disputed document would, on
balance, be in the public interest and found
that the limit on the exemption in clause 3(6) did not apply.
Accordingly, the A/FOI Deputy Commissioner found that the disputed
document is exempt under clause 3(1) of Schedule 1 to the FOI Act
and varied the
agency’s decision.
