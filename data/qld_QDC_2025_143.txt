Introduction
[1] This dispute
is between a purchaser and a vendor of a property for the return of a deposit in
the amount of $220,000. The plaintiff
relies upon the following claims in
seeking the return of that amount:
(a) Breach of contract;
(b) A debt claim pursuant to a Side Deed entered into by the parties;
(c) An Australian Consumer Law claim, where it claims the loss of the deposit as
the relevant damage. The plaintiff also seeks, as
a remedy, rescission of the
sale agreement and the Side Deed by reason of misleading or deceptive conduct
upon the part of the defendants.
directors of the plaintiff, Skyrock Sun Pty Ltd (Skyrock) are Jae Shim Min (Ms
Min) and Raymond Kok Ming Leung (Mr Leung).
[3] The sole
director and shareholder of Brades Property Agnes Water Pty Ltd (Brades
Property) and Brades PI Pty Ltd is Phillip James
Brades (Mr Brades).
[4] Matters
which are not in contention relevantly include:
[4.1] On 5 July
2022, Skyrock and Brades Property entered into a Sale
for the purchase of a
property, located at lot 107 Beaches Village Circuit, Agnes Water Queensland.
Skyrock was the purchaser and
Brades Property was the vendor;
[4.2] The Sale
Agreement was subject to certain special conditions, which included conditions
regarding the approval of a development
application in respect of the property
(Special Condition A). That development application, which had been submitted to
the Gladstone
Regional Council by Zone Planning, concerned a proposed
development whereby the property was to be reconfigured into a 15-lot
subdivision;
[4.3] On 8 July
2022, Skyrock paid the deposit in the sum of $220,000 to PRD Agnes Water (PRD),
Brades Property’s agent. James
White (Mr White) was the principal of
[4.4] On or
It had the effect of varying
the Sale Agreement but obliged the parties to “... observe and perform the
terms and conditions
of the [Sale Agreement] ... as if all of the terms and
conditions of the [Sale Agreement] were repeated in full in this
The variation related
to, amongst other things, the release of the deposit to Brades Property, on the
condition that payment would
constitute a loan that was repayable to Skyrock
under certain conditions or otherwise would be deemed to have been repaid upon
settling the purchase of the property. Repayment of the loan was
guaranteed by Brades PI and Mr Brades, who also agreed to indemnify

of decision (Decision Notice).
approval was a “deemed approval” and was subject to two special
conditions;
September 2022, in response to earlier correspondence from Zone Planning, the
Council sent an email (Council
advising that:
“... Council is of the view that compliance with
Special Condition 2 may potentially lead to a change in the layout of the
development. The amendment of the detention strategy may subsequently
impact on the number and the design of lots proposed ...”;
[4.7] On 21
September 2022, Skyrock, through correspondence from its solicitors, terminated
the Sale Agreement pursuant to Special
Condition A (Termination
and subsequently demanded
repayment of the loan.
defendants have not repaid the loan.
contentions
[5] As to the
Debt Claim, Skyrock contends that:
[5.1] pursuant
to the terms of the Side Deed, the loan became immediately repayable to Skyrock
upon Skyrock’s termination of
the Sale Agreement on 21 September
[5.2] Brades
Property is therefore liable to repay the loan, plus interest thereon;
[5.3] Brades PI
and Mr Brades are jointly and severally liable to repay the loan, by reason of
the guarantee and indemnity each provided
in the Side Deed; and
addition to the liability for the loan:
[5.4.1] each of
the defendants is liable to pay interest on the loan at the contractually agreed
rate of 10% per annum; and
[5.4.2] the
defendants are liable to pay Skyrock’s costs on an indemnity basis, having
regard to the indemnity contained in
the Side Deed.
[6] The premise
of the Contract Claim is the same as the Debt Claim, except Skyrock says that
the failure of the defendants to repay
the loan constitutes a breach of the Sale
Agreement and the Side Deed.
[7] As to the
Australian Consumer Law claim (ACL Claim), Skyrock contends that;
[7.1] prior to
the entry into the Sale Agreement, Brades Property made certain representations
through emails dated 15 June
sent by PRD as to:
[7.1.1] the
property being able to be reconfigured into 15 lots;
[7.1.2] the cost
of the proposed development; and
[7.1.3] the sale
price of each of the lots in the proposed development;
[7.2] it relied
upon, and was induced by, those representations to enter into the Sale Agreement
and Side Deed, and to pay and authorise
the release of the deposit to Brades
[7.3] those
representations were false, misleading, and deceptive in contravention of the
Australian Consumer Law; and
consequence:
[7.4.1] Brades
Property is liable to pay damages to Skyrock, in the value of the deposit;
[7.4.2] alternatively,
the Sale Agreement and Side Deed are void, which in turn would compel Brades
Property to repay the deposit
to Skyrock.
defendants deny liability on the basis that:
[8.1] As to the
debt claim and the contract claim:
[8.1.1] the loan
was only repayable if Skyrock “lawfully and validly” terminated the
Sale Agreement;
[8.1.2] Skyrock
did not have a lawful right to terminate the Sale Agreement because Skyrock had
no reasonable basis to not be satisfied
with the conditions of the Development
Approval; and
[8.1.3] therefore,
Skyrock’s termination of the Sale Agreement was a repudiation and breach
of the Sale Agreement, which entitled
Brades Property to keep the deposit
amount; and
[8.2] As to the
[8.2.1] the
representations of PRD were not made by, or with the authority of, Brades
Property; and
[8.2.2] the
representations were not capable of misleading or deceiving Skyrock, or
alternatively, did not arise from the statements
[9] The parties
agree that the issues to be determined at trial are therefore:
relation to the Debt Claim and Contract Claim:
[9.1.1] did
Skyrock have a lawful basis to terminate the Sale Agreement pursuant to Special
Condition A?; and
relation to the ACL claim:
[9.2.1] were the
representations made by Brades Property?
[9.2.2] were the
representations misleading?; and
[9.2.3] did
reliance on the representations cause Skyrock
[10] To better
understand the matter, the following detailed timeline is of assistance:
[10.1] Brades
Property was the registered proprietor of the property particularised as lot 107
on Survey Plan 301507, Title Reference
51270618, situated at Beaches Village
Circuit, Agnes Water, Queensland, 4677 (the property).
[10.2] On 11
April 2022, Brades Property made development application DA/25/2022 (development
application) to the Council for approval
to reconfigure the property into a
15-lot community title scheme (proposed development).
[10.3] At a time
prior to 15 June 2022, Brades Property appointed Agnes Street Developments Pty
Ltd as trustee for the White Lawry
Unit Trust (PRD) as its agent for the sale of
the property with authority to:
[10.3.1] sell
the property on behalf of Brades Property;
[10.3.2] negotiate
for the selling of the property on behalf of Brades Property; and
[10.3.3] market
the property for sale on behalf of Brades Property in order to find a
[10.4] On 15
June 2022, PRD, as agent for Brades Property, sent the 15 June email to Skyrock
stating relevantly:
“I have estimated complete
costs to build approx. $800,000 including power and comms and approx. $550K if I
perform civil inhouse.
The internal road is a one way road and the site is
fairly straightforward.
$800,000 civil
$420,000 contributions
$2,200,000 + gst purchase
$102,000 stamp
Average sale price $365,000 x 15 = $5,475,000.
= $4,792,000
total costs
= $1,270,000
I would say that pricing should start at $359K up to $399K which will
bring up profits”
[10.5] PRD sent
the 15 June email in response to a request from the plaintiff to PRD, asking the
first defendant to estimate the costs
to construct the subdivision.
[10.6] On 18
June 2022, PRD sent an email to Skyrock (18 June email) stating
relevantly:
I would suggest the lots will range from $375
- $425K as there are approx. eight with great sea views.”
[10.7] At the
time of receiving the 15 June email and the 18 June email, Skyrock knew the
development application for reconfiguration
of the property into 15 lots had not
yet issued.
amounts set out in the 15 June email were expressly stated to represent an
estimate of construction costs only.
[10.9] Brades
Property did not provide the requested quotation or breakdown of construction
costs, as requested by Skyrock pursuant
to an email dated 16 June 2022.
[10.10] Skyrock
knew the precise cost to complete the development could not be ascertained by it
until the Development Approval and
the Operational Works Approval had
[10.11] On 5
July 2022, Skyrock and Brades Property entered into an agreement for the sale
and purchase of the property (Sale Agreement).
[10.12] The
material terms of the Sale Agreement were,
[10.12.1] Brades
Property would sell, and Skyrock would buy, the property for the sum of
$2,200,000;
[10.12.2] Skyrock
would pay a deposit of $220,000 (deposit) to PRD within five days of 5 July
[10.12.3] if
approval of the Development Application was not issued by the relevant authority
within 90 days of 5 July 2022, either
party would be able to terminate the sale
agreement and the deposit would be refunded to Skyrock (Special Condition B);
[10.12.4] the
Sale Agreement would be conditional upon Skyrock being satisfied that the
conditions of the approval of the development
application (Special Condition
[10.12.4.1] are
consistent with the representations of Brades Property;
[10.12.4.2] are
conditions typically imposed on similar developments; and
[10.12.4.3] do
not include any provision which reduces the number of lots below
[10.13] On 8
July 2022, pursuant to the Sale Agreement, Skyrock paid the deposit to PRD.
[10.14] On 12
August 2022, Skyrock, Brades Property, Brades PI and Mr Brades entered into a
written agreement (Side Deed).
[10.15] The
material terms of the Side Deed were,
[10.15.1] The
Sale Agreement would be varied to include the following terms;
[10.15.1.1] Skyrock
would sell each lot in the proposed development within 5% of the suggested price
range of $375,000 to $425,000;
[10.15.1.2] In
the event that Skyrock fails to settle the sale agreement, the benefit of the
pre-sale contracts of lots in the Proposed
Development would be assigned to
Brades Property; and
[10.15.1.3] Brades
Property would remove any spoil and overgrown vegetation from the property and
generally reinstate the property
such that it is clean and tidy for
presentations for sale purposes.
[10.15.2] Upon
satisfaction of Brades Property removing any spoil and overgrown vegetation from
the Property and generally reinstating
the Property such that it is clean and
tidy for presentations for sale purposes, Skyrock and Brades Property would
immediately authorise
PRD to release the deposit to Brades Property on the
following terms:
[10.15.2.1] The
payment of the deposit would be a loan by Skyrock to Brades Property (loan) for
a term expiring on settlement or termination
of the Sale Agreement, whichever is
[10.15.2.2] The
loan must be repaid on expiry of the term provided:
[10.15.2.2.1] If
the expiry date coincides with settlement of the Sale Agreement or termination
by Brades Property other than under
Special Condition B, then repayment will be
deemed to have occurred at settlement or Brades Property’s
termination;
[10.15.2.2.2] If
the expiry date arises due to Brades Property’s termination of the Sale
Agreement under Special Condition B,
then repayment to Skyrock is due
immediately and, in any event, within seven days of notice of termination;
[10.15.2.2.3] The
loan would be subject to interest at 10% per annum and reduced to nil provided
the loan is repaid as provided in
the Side Deed;
[10.15.2.2.4] The
loan would be immediately repayable to Skyrock and, in any event, within seven
days of termination of the Sale Agreement
where the development approval is not
issued or, if issued, does not satisfy the provisions of Special Condition A or
Special Condition
B of the Sale Agreement;
[10.15.2.3] Brades
PI and Mr Brades would guarantee to Skyrock that Brades Property will punctually
perform its obligations under
the Side Deed for the due and punctual payment of
all monies payable by Brades Property under the Side
[10.16] On 19
August 2022, pursuant to the Side Deed, Skyrock and Brades Property authorised
PRD to release, and PRD did release,
the deposit to Brades Property.
[10.17] On 25
August 2022, pursuant to
Planning Act 2016
(Qld), the Council
approved the development application (Development Approval). The Notice of
Decision is dated 25 August 2022.
[10.18] As at
termination of the Sale Agreement on 21 September 2022, the Development
[10.18.1] did
not approve, stamp or annex to the Development Approval the plan of the Proposed
Development that accompanied the Development
Application;
[10.18.2] was
subject to the following special conditions;
[10.18.2.1] Prior
to the lodgement of any Development Application for Operational Works, the
applicant is required to submit to the
Council for approval, revised plans for
the subdivision, inclusive of the requested condition requirements outlined
within the Development
Approval (Special Condition 1);
[10.18.2.2] Prior
to the lodgement of any Development Application for Operational Works, the
applicant must submit to the Council
for approval, quantification of the
capacity of the rubble pit to accept to the proposed flow in accordance with the
Engineering
Planning Scheme Policy under the Our Place Our Plan Gladstone

[10.19] On 30
August 2022, Ms Min emailed a Mr
enquiring about whether
he had “the approved DA set with the Council approved
questions in relation to Special Conditions 1 and 2.
[10.20] Ms Min
emailed a Michael Binger
September in exactly the same terms as her email to Mr
Binger, later that day, indicated that Pinnacle Engineering was unable to assist
Enders, upon receipt of Ms Min’s email of 30 August, directed a Mr Schuler
to make enquiries of Council regarding
[10.23] On 1
September 2022, Zone Planning Group Pty Ltd (Zone Planning), Town Planner for
Brades Property, sent an email to the Council
which stated
relevantly:
With reference to the Notice of Decision recently
provided by Council in relation to the above Development Application, it is
that the conditions of the approval do not list Approved Plans. A copy of
the Notice of Decision is attached to this email.
“Special Condition 1 states:
‘Prior to the lodgement of any Development Application for
Operational Works, the applicant is required to submit to Council
for approval
revised plans with the subdivision, inclusive of the requested condition
requirements outlined here within.’
After reading the remaining conditions of the approval, it does not appear
that there are any requirements in those conditions which
would lead to the plan
of subdivision which was lodged with the application having to be amended. A
copy of the application plan
is also attached to this email for your
information.
It would be appreciated if you could please review this matter, and if you
agree that there are no provisions in any of the conditions
which would require
the plan of subdivision to be amended, to then issue a stamped copy of the plan
of subdivision as the Approved
Plan for this Notice of Decision.”
[10.24] On 1
September 2022, Ms Abena Dankwa (a Planning Officer from the Customer Experience
Division of Council) sent an email to
Mr Binger indicating relevantly (Council
is of the view that compliance with special condition 2 may potentially lead to
a change in the layout of the proposed
development. The amendment of the
detention strategy may subsequently impact on the number and design of lots
[10.25] On 13
September 2022, Mr Binger responded to Ms Dankwa’s email clarifying that
the concerns regarding the stormwater
issues relating to the rubble pit had
already been noted and that’s why the Pinnacle Engineering drawings
submitted with the
application noted “yet to be cleaned and confirmed
functional”.
[10.26] On 15
September 2022, Ms Min chased up Mr Enders regarding the outcome of enquiries
made by Mr Enders with Council. Mr Enders
forwarded Ms Min’s email to Mr
Schuler responded to Ms Min later that same day and relevantly
I also advise that there have been further representations made to Council by
the applicant’s engineer in relation
to the stormwater issue. The
applicant has advised that you may contact the engineer for advice regarding his
discussions.”
[10.28] Between
17 September and 19 September 2022, Ms Min sent the following emails:
[10.28.1] to Mr
Dave Weston of DRW Consulting (DRW) on 17 September 2022 requesting that he
check a particular checklist of items
and indicating “
we need to go
position ourselves,”
[10.28.2] to
Jason Cheers of DRW on 17 September 2022 requesting a cost estimate over the
weekend because
“this is the critical information for us to make the
key decisions on Monday
[10.29] On 18
September 2022, Ms Min received a bill of quantities from Mr
[10.30] On 19
September 2022, Ms Min emailed Paul Jacuba of DRW as
As discussed, the contract is us satisfying the DA condition, we are not
satisfied with that and we need to prove that. We also have
the concern on the
project viability with the current DA design. When you discuss with the Council,
can you ensure
1. As it currently stands, the council sees the impact on the number and
design of lots proposed as per their email. This is the key
to us exit the
contract. Why no stamped plan with the decision notice.
2. The council views of the new design approach, how they see it and time
involved in it.”
[10.31] On 20
September 2022, Ms Min asks Mr Jacuba whether there was any update from
[10.32] Later on
20 September 2022, Mr Jacuba advised Ms Min that he hadn’t been able to
reach anyone at Council.
[10.33] On 21
September 2022, Skyrock demanded Brades Property to repay the loan to
[10.34] Brades
Property has refused to repay the loan to Skyrock.
[10.35] Brades
Property’s conduct in sending the 15 June email was in trade or commerce
within the meaning of the Australian
Consumer Law, being s 18 of Sch II to the
Competition and Consumer Act 2010
[10.36] Since at
least 7 October 2022, Brades Property marketed the lots in the Proposed
Development for sale at prices from $329,000.
[10.37] On 14
October 2022, pursuant to the Side Deed, Skyrock demanded Mr Brades repay the
loan to Skyrock.
[10.38] Despite
demand each of Mr Brades and Brades PI have not repaid the loan to
Debt and contract claims
[11] The parties
agree that a party who seeks to terminate a contract must have a lawful and
valid basis to do so.
defendants plead that they do not owe any sum to Skyrock, because
Skyrock’s termination of the Sale Agreement was not
lawful and valid.
[13] Skyrock
admits that as Special Condition A was exercisable upon Skyrock “being
satisfied”, it needed to only act
honestly in forming the view that the
conditions of the approval of the Development Application were not satisfactory.
In other words,
it is submitted that Special Condition A required a subjective
assessment.
[14] Before
turning to that issue though, the defendants have submitted that there is a
threshold test which Skyrock has failed to
meet and which renders each claim
without merit.
[15] They submit
that the evidence makes clear that the basis upon which Skyrock understood the
conditions in the Development Approval
as reducing the lot number to below 15 is
premised entirely on the Council email of 1 September 2022, and not on
any provision in
the Development Approval, contrary to Special Condition A.
[16] The first
step then is to determine what Special Condition A required of Skyrock.
[17] Relevantly,
Special Condition A stated that the Sale Agreement would be conditional upon
Skyrock being satisfied that the conditions
of the approval of the development
application are consistent with the representations of Brades Property and do
not include any
provision which reduces the number of lots to below 15.
plaintiff, however, has not identified any condition in the approval, that
includes a provision which reduces the number
of lots to below 15.
[19] Rather, the
plaintiff has produced evidence of the dissatisfaction and concern that
Ms Min and Mr Leung had with the Decision
Notice soon after their
receipt of it.
dissatisfaction arose from the fact that no stamped plan accompanied the
approval. But the absence of a stamped plan, did
not, of itself, constitute a
provision which reduced the number of lots to below 15. There is no doubt that
Ms Min held a concern
that, in the absence of a stamped plan, the number of
lots could be reduced to below 15, notwithstanding the fact that the approval
was for a subdivision of one lot into 15. The enquiries which she subsequently
made (as referred to in the timeline) were as a consequence
[20] But the
wording of Special Condition A (on this point) is clear and unambiguous.
Skyrock could only lawfully and validly terminate
the Sale Agreement if
satisfied that the conditions of the approval of the Development Application did
not include any provision
which reduced the number of lots to below 15. That
does not include a provision which may allow for the ultimate number of lots
be below 15. Yet that is the position that Skyrock was confronted with.
[21] As I have
already noted, the Council email of 1 September 2022 relevantly
“Council is of the view that compliance with
Special Condition 2
potentially lead to a change in the layout of the
proposed development. The amendment of the detention strategy
subsequently impact on the number and design of the lots proposed.”
(My underlining)
[22] That email
makes it unambiguously clear, that the conditions of the approval of the
Development Application, whilst including
a provision which may reduce the
number of lots to below 15, did not include a provision which positively so
reduced the number of
lots. Yet, Special Condition A requires such a positive
reduction before Skyrock could lawfully and validly terminate the Sale Agreement
on that basis.
[23] Whilst it
is acknowledged that Ms Min and Mr Leung had understandable concerns
as to the profitability of the proposed venture,
the wording of Special
Condition A did not allow for the termination of the Sale Agreement on the basis
of there being a chance that
a subdivision into 15 lots might not occur. It
follows, that the termination of the Sale Agreement, on that basis, was unlawful
and invalid.
[24] Skyrock
submits however, that a second basis for a lawful and valid termination of the
Sale Agreement existed. That is, that
Special Condition A also provided that
the Sale Agreement would be conditional upon Skyrock being satisfied that the
conditions of
the approval of the Development Application are consistent with
the representations of Brades Property. The defendants submit that
conditions in the Development Approval were consistent with the lot number
representation as they did not change the property
from being divided into 15
[25] The issues
which must be first addressed then, are what were the representations, then, and
were such representations made by
Brades Property.
[26] Each of
those issues, however, are not the subject of dispute. In the defendant’s
“opening outline of submissions”
The defendants accept that by reason of the 15 June
email, the lot number representation was conveyed and that Mr White made
representation on behalf of Brades
[27] The parties
agree that the next issue which arises is whether the plaintiff’s
“satisfaction”, pursuant to Special
Condition A, is to be assessed
on a subjective or objective basis.
[28] In my view
however that is not an issue which requires determination. Given the evidence,
the plaintiff’s stated dissatisfaction
that the conditions of the
Development Approval are consistent with the representation of Brades Property
was well founded, irrespective
of whether judged subjectively or objectively.
[29] The email
of 15 June relevantly and unambiguously stated that the property will be
subdivided into 15 lots. That email then
included a calculation as to the
potential profit to be made upon the sale of those 15 developed lots.
representation, therefore, was to the effect that the proposed sub-division will
result in 15 separate lots. This was therefore
a positive assertion of a future
event with no room for any uncertainty as to the potential success of the
proposed subdivision.
[31] Yet, it is
clear, that notwithstanding the nature of the approval of the Development
Application, it was not consistent with
such a degree of certainty.
[32] Ms Mins’
evidence that she was troubled by the absence of a Stamped Plan attached to the
Decision Notice was demonstrably
truthful. She immediately undertook enquiries
as to the potential relevance of such an absence. Notwithstanding that the
made on her behalf really did not provide an answer to what might be
the final position, they did result in the Council email of
1 September 2022.
noteworthy that that email was sent under the hand of Abena Dankwa, who was also
the “contact officer” on the
Decision Notice. The information
contained in that email therefore carried significant relevant weight as it came
from an informed
officer of the decision-making body.
[34] Ms Dankwa’s
statement in that email:
Council is of the view that
compliance with special condition 2 may potentially lead to a change in the
layout of the proposed development.
The amendment of the detention strategy may
subsequently impact on the number and design of the lots
... is highly relevant.

highlights that the Development Approval, notwithstanding its conditions,
potentially allowed for an outcome that
reduced the number of lots to below
immediately gives rise to a degree of uncertainty that is quite inconsistent
with the proposed lot number representations
of the defendants.
defendants have submitted that Skyrock’s misunderstanding of the impact of
the special conditions arises from Ms Min
placing greater emphasis on the
view of Ms Dankwa rather than on the terms of the Development Approval. In
that regard, they refer
to the reports and evidence of the expert witnesses,
Mr Irvine and
Mr Buckley.
[38] But that
submission misses the point. It was not unreasonable (viewed either
subjectively or objectively) for Skyrock to rely
upon the Council email as
confirmation or reinforcement of Skyrock’s concerns about the uncertainty
arising from the Decision
Notice not including or referencing a stamped plan, in
circumstances where the Council is the consent authority and the ultimate
decision-maker as to the nature and size of any approved development of the
[39] Ms Min’s
evidence was:
The [Council email] was a real trigger
point. I was already concerned about the conditions of the Approval Notice and
the lack of
a stamped plan attached to the Approval Notice. The email from the
Council confirmed that the special conditions may potentially
lead to a change
in the design or a reduction in the lot yield of the subdivided property.
Either of those options was going to
significantly impact the viability of the
[40] Ms Min
and Mr Leung’s conclusion that the Council email threatened the yield
and therefore the potential viability of the
proposed development was honest.
The Council email clearly implied that as at September 2022, the number of
lots approved could
be reduced.
[41] Skyrock’s
decision to terminate the Sale Agreement because it was not satisfied that the
conditions of the Decision Notice
were consistent with the number of lots
representation, was an honest exercise of Skyrock’s discretion under
Special Condition
[42] Further, or
in the alternative, if Skyrock was required to be objectively satisfied that the
conditions of the Decision Notice
were consistent with the number of lots
representation, the situation does not change.
[43] A decision
notice should be clear on its face. In
Hawkins and Izzard v Permarig Pty
and Brisbane City Council
Brabazon QC, DCJ
As a general rule, development consents are public
documents which operate for the benefit of successive owners of the land, and
should be construed without reference to extrinsic evidence.
The basic principle is that reference may be properly made to those
documents which are either actually incorporated in the approval
incorporated by reference into it. Generally speaking, apart from such
documents which are incorporated, it is not possible
to go outside the approval
document in considering its meaning. Even an application should not be referred
to, unless it has, in
whole or in part, expressly or by necessary implication,
been incorporated in the consent.
plaintiff submits that that is a principle which accords with commonsense and
commerciality – parties submitting a
development approval ought to have
certainty when the decision-maker makes that decision. I agree with that
submission. It is therefore
unsurprising that both experts called by the
parties, being Mr Irvine for the plaintiff and Mr Buckley for the
defendant, agree with
[45] Even though
the expert’s opinions were that the Decision Notice allowed for 15 lots,
it was also accepted that that was
potentially subject to change in relation to
the number of lots and the size of the
[46] Despite the
opinions of Mr Buckley and Mr Irvine that the Decision Notice did
refer to a reconfiguration of the property into
15 lots, that does not detract
from the fact that:
(a) the special conditions of the Decision Notice did not provide the certainty
of a reference to an approved plan;
(b) as Mr Irvine opined, the reference to 15 lots at Part 5 of the Notice
of Decision was merely a reference to what was
(c) the clear and unequivocal words of the Council email indicate that the
number and design of the lots proposed may be impacted.
[47] Ms Min’s
evidence that the Council email was the “trigger point” is clear and
I accept that Skyrock acted on
the unequivocal words of the Council. It was
objectively reasonable for Skyrock to accept the Council’s position
was the consent authority and the Council email was a response to
Zone Planning’s attempt to obtain a stamped plan given its
absence in the
Decision Notice.
[48] Furthermore,
the defendant’s submission that if the application was going to be refused
by the Council, then a deemed development
approval could not have been issued,
misconstrues
Planning Act 2016
Subsection 5
“On the day the assessment manager receives the deemed
approval notice, the assessment manager is taken to have given an approval
deemed approval) to the applicant.”
[49] Brades
Property submitted a deemed approval notice on 17 August 2022 because
it had failed to respond to the Council’s
information request of
9 August 2022.
then “... required Council to issue its decision-notice on the DA within
10 business days from receiving the deemed approval
confirmed in evidence that the process outlined in
Planning Act
(Qld) is what occurred in this matter.
[50] As the
plaintiff has correctly submitted, there was no discretion for the Council to
not issue the decision notice. But, because
it was a deemed decision notice in
circumstances where an information request had not been responded to, it did not
prevent the Council
from imposing
conditions.
[51] Finally, on
this point I note that the defendants submit that the correspondence of
21 September 2022 from Skyrock’s solicitors
(termination letter)
“only identifies the lot number representation as having been relied upon
by Skyrock in entering into
the Sale Agreement” and “is therefore
also the most reliable evidence as to the basis upon which Skyrock purportedly
terminated the Sale Agreement.”
therefore worth repeating the relevant contents of that termination
on 25 August 2022, pursuant to a Deemed Approval Notice under
Planning Act 2016
(Qld), the Application was approved (approval).
The approval was subject to conditions set out in the Notice of Decision.
Those conditions require the Applicant, prior to lodgement
of any Development
Application for Operational Works, to submit to Council for approval:
(a) revised plans for the subdivision of the Property (Special Condition 1);
(b) quantification of the capacity of the rubble pit (quantification) to
accept proposed flow, certified by an experienced RPEQ, which
may require
amendments to the detention strategy for the development (Special Condition
(c) On or about 15 September 2022, our client was provided with an
email from the Gladstone Regional Council dated 1 September 2022
which the Council wrote:
‘Special Condition 1 serves as a precursor to Special Condition 2
Council is of the view that compliance with Special 2 may potentially lead
to a change in the layout of the proposed development.
The amendment of the
detention strategy may subsequently impact on the number and design of lots
In the circumstances described above, our client considers the
is not consistent with the Seller’s Representations; and
includes a provision which may reduce the number of lots below 15.
Given the above our client elects to terminate the Contract in accordance
with the Special Condition headed ‘Development
Approval’.”
[53] That letter
is consistent with the evidence of Ms Min and Mr Leung, and is the
most reliable evidence as to the basis upon which
Skyrock terminated the
[54] It follows
that I am satisfied that, upon this basis, Skyrock validly and lawfully
terminated the Sale Agreement.
Conditions typically imposed in
similar developments
plaintiff also submits that it lawfully and validly terminated the contract
because it was not satisfied that the conditions
of the approval of the
Development Application were conditions typically imposed on similar
developments – the difference allegedly
being the absence of a stamped
[56] The first
point to note, of course, is that this was not an issue that was identified in
the termination letter, which immediately
undermines the veracity of the claim.
[57] Notwithstanding
that fact though, the plaintiff’s evidence on this issue is lacking.
Ms Min had only ever sighted one
previous development approval from the
Gladstone Regional Council. To suggest that she was therefore in a position to
be satisfied
that the conditions in this matter were not typical is farfetched.
Furthermore, insofar as Skyrock now relies on the difference
between the wording
of Special Condition 2 of the Development Approval requiring the submission of a
report on the rubble pit capacity
prior to the application for Operational Works
as compared to the comparable decision notices referred to in
Mr Buckley’s supplementary
report and Mr Irvine’s second
report, such difference has no practical effect and is of no relevance to this
defendants have further submitted that the absence of a stamped plan from the
Development Approval could not be a valid ground
for termination within the
scope of the ‘conditions typically imposed’ subclause.
[59] However,
the issue as to whether the absence of a stamped plan falls within such a scope
does not require resolution, given my
conclusion that Ms Min had not been in a
position to determine if the conditions imposed were typical.
The Australian Consumer Law claim
Cost to complete representation
[60] The email
from Mr White to Ms Min on 15 June 2022, as agent for Brades
Property relevantly said:
“I have estimated complete costs
to build approx. $800,000 including power and comms and approx. $550K if I
perform civil inhouse.”
[61] Ms Min
gave evidence that she was aware at the time, that Mr Brades had recently
undertaken a similar development in a nearby
location. She attested that she
therefore placed particular reliance on his estimate.
I did heavily – as I mentioned, I heavily rely on seller’s
representation, given his familiarity of it, given
his expertise, given
he’s just done one, given it’s a reasonable area. I have rely on
his representations, although
I consider my own ‘as
evidence demonstrates that Ms Min did not, in fact, rely on
Mr Brades’ estimate. As she said, she arranged for quotations
prepared, as one would expect. In fact, she obtained three “quotes”
as to the likely construction costs.
25 June 2022, Ms Min sent an email to Mr White which stated
As discussed, the total construction cost (not just civil) we confirmed
from three sets of quotes were very similar but they were
much higher than the
seller’s estimation.
We prepare to offer $2m (inclusive of GST with approved DA), 10% deposit,
unconditional, 30 days settlement after DA approval.
This is a genuine unconditional offer, if it doesn’t get accepted we
will move on to other deals.”
[64] That email
is informative for three reasons:
[64.1] it shows
that Ms Min understood that Mr Brades had provided an “estimate”
[64.2] it shows
that Ms Min understood the difference between an “estimate” and
a “quote”; and
[64.3] it shows
that Ms Min was not prepared to act upon Mr Brades’ estimate,
but rather, undertook the sensible option of obtaining
independent
quotations.
combination of evidence overwhelmingly shows that Ms Min did not rely on
Mr Brades’ estimate when deciding to purchase
the property,
notwithstanding her evidence to the contrary.
The number of
lots representation
[66] As I have
already noted, the defendants do not dispute that Brades’ property made
the number of lots representation, as
alleged, in the email of Mr White
dated 15 June 2022.
[67] The issue
for determination however, is whether the representation was misleading or
Selfcare IP Holdings Pty Ltd v Allergan Australia Pty
at [80], the High Court
identified the four-step process that is to be undertaken to determine whether
particular conduct is misleading
or deceptive.
[69] The Court
“Determining whether a person has breached s 18 of
the ACL involves four steps:
, identifying with precision the
‘conduct’ said to contravene s 18;
, considering
whether the identified conduct was conduct ‘in trade or commerce’;
, considering what meaning that conduct conveyed; and
determining whether that conduct in light of that meaning was ‘misleading
or deceptive or ... likely to mislead or deceive’.”
[70] Section 18
of the ACL provides, inter alia, that “a person must not, in trade or
commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading
or deceptive or is likely to
mislead or deceive”.
[71] Section
4(1) of the ACL provides that if a person makes a representation with respect to
any future matter and the person does
not have reasonable grounds for making the
representation, the representation is taken to be misleading.
defendants have submitted that the representation was not misleading or
deceptive because there were reasonable grounds for
Brades property to have made
plaintiff has submitted that as the Council’s first request for further
information was dated
16 May 2022
Brades Property did not respond to it until 5 July 2022, the Number of
Lots Representation made on 15 June 2022 was made
with the knowledge
Council required information for the purposes of considering Brades
Property’s application; and
[73.2] that, not
having provided the requested information, there was no guarantee that the
Council would have approved the 15 Lots
proposed in the
application.
plaintiff has further submitted that, in these circumstances, Brades Property
made the Number of Lots Representation with
reckless indifference to their
and could not have had
reasonable grounds to make the representation.
[75] I note,
that s 4 of the ACL places an evidential burden on the person who made the
relevant representation to adduce evidence
that there were reasonable grounds
for making it.
[76] So, the
question becomes: What was the actual representation?
[77] There is no
doubt on the evidence, nor is it disputed, that the representation made was that
Development Approval would occur
approving the subdivision of the block into 15
lots. Ms Min acknowledged that she understood that to be the
representation in her
evidence. In her affidavit of 20 March 2025,
Ms Min attested that at the time Skyrock entered into the Sale Agreement,
she believed
that a development approval would be issued in the near future and
that would confirm the property was approved for subdivision into
development.
[78] She also
attested that she requested special conditions be included in the Sale Agreement
to ensure the sale of the property
was subject to obtaining a satisfactory
development approval, so that if the Development Approval was not to her and
satisfaction, they would not have to settle and could
recover the deposit.
notwithstanding the positive assertion on the part of Brades Property that the
application for subdivision into 15 lots would
be successful, the plaintiff had
the good sense to include those special conditions in the Sale Agreement.
[80] That is
unambiguous evidence that the plaintiff was not mislead or deceived by the first
defendant, and that the representation
made was not misleading or deceptive, or
likely to mislead or deceive.
[81] I also
note, that the Council did ultimately approve the proposed subdivision into 15
albeit at some later time,
which further supports the conclusion that the conduct of Brades Property in
making the representation
was not misleading or deceptive, and that Brades
Property had reasonable grounds for making the representation.
[82] There is
therefore no merit to this aspect of the claim.
The selling price
representation
[83] This part
of the claim is based upon an assertion by the plaintiff, that where it was said
in the 18 June email from Mr White
“I would suggest the lots will range from
$375K to $425K as there are approx. eight with great sea views.”
that Mr White was referring to a sale price and not a listing price. It
is further submitted that when compared to the average sale
price referred to in
the 15 June email of $365,000, and in the absence of supporting evidence as
to how the range of price was estimated,
the Selling Price Representation was
apt to mislead and had no reasonable basis for it to be made.
[84] Whether the
range stated by Mr White in the 18 June email (which was just a cut
and paste of an email from Mr Brades to Mr White
on 17 June) was
a listing or a sale range is not clear. Mr White appeared to accept in
cross-examination that it was a sale price
although he was not the
author of the text, as it was an email he had simply cut and pasted from an
email to him from Mr Brades.
[85] Mr Brades,
rather unconvincingly, purported to be ignorant of the distinction between a
listing price and a sale
[86] It must
also be noted that in the 15 June email, Ms Min had also been advised
that the average sale price for the 15 lots would
be $365,000.
[87] Ultimately,
the evidence which is of the most persuasive value regarding this issue, is the
[86.1] The lots
in the subject property were superior to the lots in the nearby property that
Brades Property had developed and sold
previously (Lot 12), because eight of the
proposed lots had sea views;
[86.2] 13 of the
16 lots in Lot 12 had sold in just over three weeks; and
[86.3] the lots
in Lot 12 sold for between $349,000 and
[88] Given these
uncontradicted facts, whether the range of $375,000 to $425,000 was a suggested
listing price or selling price is
of no moment. It is quite clear that at the
time of making the representation, Brades Property had reasonable grounds for
it, based upon the sale prices of the properties in Lot 12.
[89] Furthermore,
I note that Ms Min attested that she did not rely on the suggested range of
$375,000 to $425,000 when assessing
the feasibility and viability of the
proposed development. She
actually, I wouldn’t I, at that time, so if I time go back to the point of
the reading the email, I wouldn’t
I just assume so that’s his
suggestion. However, on the 5
June, that feasibility is the one
that I go by – of the number. As in, what we could achieve on the
feasibility of the project
[90] In other
words, Ms Min relied on the average sale price figure of $365,000 and not
the pleaded range of $375,000 to $425,000.
[91] For these
reasons this part of the claim also fails.
[92] The ACL
claim is dismissed.
[93] For these
reasons I am satisfied that the debt claim and the contract claim have been
proved to the requisite standard and that
Skyrock is entitled to payment of
$220,000 from Brades Property, Brades PI and Mr Brades as a debt or damages. I
am also satisfied
that interest on that amount should be paid at the rate of 10%
per annum, as per their agreement.
[94] As to the
issues of costs, in accordance with the terms of the Side Deed, the parties
agreed that costs would be paid on an indemnity
basis. It appears to me that
that would be the appropriate order to make although I note that no specific
submissions as to that
issue have yet been made by the defendants and I will
allow further submissions to be made, if they wish to do
plaintiff’s claim is allowed.
defendants pay to the plaintiff the sum of $220,000 as a debt or damages, plus
interest at the rate of 10% per annum.
will hear the parties as to the form of the orders and as to costs.
ACL claim is dismissed.
