Alteration of other rules of organisation.
On 24 May 2024 The Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers
(the Institute) lodged with the Fair Work Commission (the Commission)
and declaration setting out particulars of alterations to its rules. Further
material was lodged on 22 November 2024.
On the information contained in the notice and declaration, I am
satisfied the alterations have been made under the rules of the
organisation.
When transacting the present alterations, the Institute also made
changes to its eligibility
An application
for consent to those eligibility rule alterations was lodged under
Act. It was superseded by a further
application
Commission staff queried whether the original material complied with Reg. 121 of
Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Regulations 2009
. The second
application remains on foot. Objections have been lodged. The Member
dealing with the eligibility rule application asked me to defer
consideration of
this matter, while the parties attempted to resolve the objections. However, the
Member subsequently indicated they
were content for me to determine this matter,
notwithstanding the eligibility rule application remains on foot.
The Institute seeks certification of the alterations under section
Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009
The particulars set out alterations to Rules 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19,
20, 21, 23, 24, 28, 30, 31, 38, 43, 44 and 49.
The alterations are not controversial. They:
• the location of branch, general and special
• when each branch’s monthly meeting is
• who chairs a branch
• what funds constitute the Institute’s federal
• what funds constitute a branch’s
• what material is subject to audit after the end of each financial
• increase the quorum at branch monthly meetings from five to
• ease requirements for member attendance at Branch
• require the Institute’s supreme governing
budget for the following financial year, while reserving the committee of
management’s
right to authorise additional expenditure throughout the financial
• rewrite the rules in gender neutral
• improve the readability of the rules by making minor grammatical and
syntax changes;
• consequentially renumber various
On 22 November 2024 Martin Byrne, Federal President gave consent
under subsection 159(2) of the Act for me to make various amendments
alterations for the purpose of correcting typographical, clerical or formal
errors. Accordingly, the following corrections
have been made:
The reference to
Rule 15(b) in the particulars has been changed to Rule 15(iii)(b).
The reference to
Rule 15(c) in the particulars has been changed to Rule 15(iii)(c).
The reference to
Rule 19(vi) in the particulars has been changed to Rule 19(iv).
The reference to
Rule 42(iii) in the particulars has been changed to Rule 43(iii).
“this being” in Rule 20 have been deleted and the word
“by” inserted in lieu.
In my opinion, the alterations comply with and are not contrary to
the Act, the
Fair Work Act 2009
, modern awards and enterprise agreements,
are not otherwise contrary to law and were made under the rules of the
organisation. I
certify accordingly under subsection 159(1) of the Act.
