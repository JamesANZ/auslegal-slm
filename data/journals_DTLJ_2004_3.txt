[2004] WASC 49

Introduction
1. On 26 March 2004,
Justice Roberts-Smith of the Supreme Court of Western
Australia delivered his judgment in
AIM Maintenance Ltd v Brunt and Anor
[2004] WASC 49.
The case concerned an application for an interlocutory
injunction based on a breach of confidential information and trade secrets,
and breaches of fiduciary duties by employees.
2. AIM Maintenance Ltd (
) carries on a business for the design, maintenance, manufacture and alteration of gearboxes and pumps in the
petrochemical industry.
The Plaintiff employed Brunt and Jenkins
until January of 2003. At that time, each of the Defendants
resigned and, in breach of their employment contracts, ceased to provide
services to the Plaintiff. It was alleged that the Defendants, both before and
after their resignations, had negotiated to
provide the same services as those
provided by the Plaintiff to Lightnin Mixers Pty Limited (
National-Oilwell Pty Ltd (
), two of the Plaintiff’s major
The Plaintiff submitted that the Defendants’ positions within the
company meant that they were in possession of confidential
information
and trade secrets that were essential to the
Plaintiff’s continuing business relationships with Lightnin and
It was also submitted that, as senior employees, the
Defendants stood in a fiduciary relationship to the Plaintiff and owed
duties. The Plaintiff thereby sought an interlocutory
restraining the Defendants from using trade secrets or confidential
information,
and from entering contracts with Lightnin and National in competition
with the Plaintiff’s business.
Confidential Information and
Trade Secrets
4. By the Defendants’ employment contracts with the Plaintiff, they were
required to sign Confidentiality Agreements and Intellectual
Property Assignment
Agreements (
). The terms of those Agreements relevantly
imposed “absolute” requirements to keep all information obtained
course of employment confidential and to assign all intellectual property to the
5. The confidential information and trade secrets identified by the Plaintiff as
being protected by the Agreements included, among
technical knowledge concerning the manufacture of pumps and
gearboxes in the mining and petrochemical industry
the needs, work projects and existing contracts of Lightnin
the pricing structure and arrangements of the
Plaintiff with its customers, and in particular of Lightnin and
The Defendants submitted that the Plaintiff had failed to
sufficiently identify the information alleged to constitute
confidential
information and trade secrets and, in any event, had
failed to distinguish
between that information and the knowledge and experience
gained by the
Defendants from working in the industry generally.
7. Roberts-Smith J, in considering this issue, quoted extensively from his judgment in
Independent Corporate Services Ltd v Stephens
[2002] WASC
in which substantial reference was made to
Faccenda Chicken Ltd v
Fowler & Ors
[1986] 1 All ER 617.
In this respect, his
Honour accepted that
“such information is capable of attracting protection as trade secrets or confidential
information” and that
there was a serious question to be tried on the matter.
8. His Honour
also noted the Plaintiff’s submissions in respect of the judicial and
academic criticism of
the extent to which confidential information not amounting to a trade
secret could be protected by a restrictive covenant.
In that regard,
his Honour stated his
view of the law, based on the judgments of Samuels JA and Kirby P in
Gasweld Pty Ltd
(1991) 22 NSWLR 317
, to be that “confidential
information falling short of
a “trade secret” may be
protected after the termination
of employment, by
express restrictive covenant”. However, his Honour considered it
unnecessary to address, and therefore
left open questions relating to, the limitations that would apply to such a restraint.
Fiduciary Duty
The Plaintiff had submitted that irrespective of what the position was
in relation to the confidential information, the Defendants’
failure to give the requisite four weeks notice that was required by
the employment contract meant that the Agreements
operative and as such the Defendant’s were
contractually bound not to use that information. In this regard, his
Honour made
reference to the fact that employment relationships were not
“purely contractual” and pointed to their fiduciary nature.
His Honour did
point out, however, that if the Plaintiff’s evidence were
accepted at trial, those Agreements would have been
operative for the
“continuation of the defendants’ employment with the
plaintiff”.
10. Finally,
Roberts-Smith J addressed the plaintiff’s submission that an
should be granted because the confidential
information and trade secrets used by the Defendants would give them a commercial
“headstart” over any competitor other
than the Plaintiff. In doing so, his Hounour cited with approval
United States Surgical Corp v
Hospital Products International Pty Ltd
[1983] 2 NSWLR 157
and held that
there was a serious question to be tried as to whether, in the absence
of protection being granted over the information,
damages should be
afforded to the Plaintiff.
11. Having regard to
the balance of convenience, Roberts-Smith J noted that:
operations that Brunt was responsible for during his employment with the Plaintiff, Lightnin accounted for more than 80% of
if the Defendant was to take over the work for Lightnin
and National, it would “irreparably destroy the plaintiff’s commercial
relationship with those customers”
Defendant’s had not referred to any prejudice they might suffer if they
were prevented from contracting with Lightnin and
above basis, his Honour found that the balance of convenience was entirely with
the Plaintiff and ordered that the interlocutory
injunction be
