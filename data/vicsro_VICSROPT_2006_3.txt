to the Supply of Goods
Revenue Ruling PT.123
Replaces PT.054
Payroll Tax Act 1971
provides for certain contractors (whether
incorporated or not) to be deemed employees
(under what are defined as "relevant contracts")
and for payments to those contractors to be defined
as wages for the purposes of the Act.
Although most contracts for the provision of
services are relevant contracts for the purposes of
of the Act and payment made in
relation to such contracts are generally wages
subject to payroll tax, there are a number of
possible exemptions that will exclude payments
under such contracts from the definition of wages.
The purpose of this Revenue Ruling is to explain the
operation of the exemption under
section 3C(1)(d)
of the Act concerning contracts where the provision
of labour is ancillary to the provision of materials
and/or equipment.
The Commissioner of State Revenue (the
Commissioner) has ruled that the provision of
labour under a contract will be considered to be
ancillary to the provision of materials and/or
equipment under that contract where the cost to
the principal of the provision of the materials and/or
equipment exceeds 65% of the contract amount, as
evidenced on the contractor's invoice.
The amount attributable to materials and/or
equipment on the invoice must be a reasonable
figure, having regard to the type of services
provided. In determining what is a reasonable
figure, due regard must be given to the current
market prices for such materials and equipment.
This exemption will not apply if the materials and/or
equipment are purchased from the principal or any
member of a group of employers (within the
meaning of the Act), to which the principal belongs.
Where materials and/or equipment have been so
purchased on an arms length basis, employers may
make application to the Commissioner for a private
ruling in accordance with Revenue Ruling GEN.009
if they consider the exemption should apply.
The exemption will not apply where the amount on
the invoice which represents the non-labour
component is not a reasonable figure having
regard to the type of services provided.
In cases where the 65% criterion is not satisfied and
the employer considers this exemption should
nevertheless apply, an application in writing should
be submitted to the Commissioner for a private
Industry Rulings - Plumbers, Electricians and
Cabinet makers
Payments made to contracting plumbers,
electricians and cabinet makers engaged in the
building industry to ensure that prime cost items
are put in place are exempt from pay-roll tax.
The intention of these industry rulings is to exempt
contractors who are running their own independent
trade or business and are not providing essentially
labour-only services. These industry rulings are not
intended to exempt contractors who charge an
hourly rate for their services and merely on-charge
the cost of materials.
These industry rulings are only applicable where
the following conditions are satisfied:
� The contractor must quote for the job inclusive
labour and materials;
� The contractor must bear the cost and
responsibility for any faulty workmanship or
materials specified in the quote; and
� The contractor must provide all the materials
and equipment necessary to ensure that the
prime cost items are put in place.
� For contracting plumbers - the plumber
must provide all materials (e.g. tubing,
bends, traps, spouting, downpipes etc)
necessary to fulfil the contract. This
exemption will not apply where the person
engaging the plumber supplies such
materials. The exemption will, however,
apply where the person engaging the
plumber only supplies such items as the
major prime cost items (e.g. appliances) or
prime cost d�cor fittings (e.g. baths, basins,
taps etc.).
� For contracting electricians - the electrician
must provide all the materials (e.g.
electrical cabling, switches etc) necessary to
fulfil the contract. This exemption will not
apply where the person engaging the
electrician supplies such materials. The
exemption will, however, apply where the
person engaging the electrician only
supplies such items as the major prime cost
items (e.g. appliances) or prime cost d�cor
fittings (e.g. light fittings).
� For contracting cabinet makers - the
cabinet maker must provide all the raw
materials and manufacture the cabinets on
his own premises using his own equipment.
When the above conditions are not satisfied the
exemption does not apply. However, where the
contractor provides some equipment or materials,
the contractor deduction available to contractor
plumbers, electricians and cabinet makers may still
be available. (See Revenue Ruling PT.122)
Please note that rulings do not have the force of
law. Each decision made by the State Revenue
Office is made on the merits of each individual
case having regard to any relevant ruling. All
rulings must be read subject to Revenue Ruling
