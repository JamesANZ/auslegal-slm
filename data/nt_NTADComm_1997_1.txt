COUNSEL FOR THE
RESPONDENT: JOHN
ISSUES: COSTS - RESERVED FROM DECISION OF
OCTOBER 1996
DATE OF DECISION: 9 MAY
FUNNELL V KUNBARLLANJNJA COMMUNITY GOVERNMENT COUNCIL (NO 3
Reasons for decision - costs
On 24 October 1996 I handed down my decision in the matter of the
claim by Constable Brett Funnell that he had been victimised by
Kunballanjnja
Community Government Council. I found that Constable Funnell had been
victimised.
At the end of the written reasons for that decision I noted
that at the request of one of the parties I would leave the issue of costs
determined at a later time. In doing so I did indicate my basic position. It
was that parties should bear their costs excepting
where costs have had to be
unnecessarily incurred because of some unreasonable action of the other party. I
invited the parties to
make submissions.
Since that time the parties have
made written submissions concerning costs. In brief Constable Funnell claims
costs. This claim is
opposed by the Kunballanjnja Community Government
Constable Funnell claims costs on the following basis:
• Kunballanjnja Community Government Council failed to attend
conciliation conferences proposed for 26 March 1996 and for 2
September 1996
• Kunballanjnja Community Government Council filed a defence 11 days
late and gave as an excuse for the delay the fact of the
death of the former
President of the Council. Constable Funnell says that the President died one
week after the date when the defence
should have been filed
• Kunballanjnja Community Government Council forced the delay in the
final hearing because of an untrue submission that there
had been a death in the
community. This meant that it was not possible to hold the hearing on 26/27
August 1996
• the evidence of Mr Tom Kairupan was "malicious and unreasonable" the
case involved a set of complex issues of public importance
and thus, in
accordance with Sinnapan's case, should be the subject of a cost's award. The
suggested "complex" issues related to
the fact that this hearing was the first
hearing on issues under the
Anti Discrimination Act
relating to vicarious
liability and victimisation.
Kunballanjnja Community Government Council
argues that:
• there are no "exceptional circumstances" as to justify the awarding
• in respect of the postponement of the hearing this was not an
"exceptional circumstance" because "it did not reflect adversely
Respondent".
The general principle to be applied in determining costs is
set out in section 96 of the Anti Discrimination Act. This provides as
"(1) Subject to subsection (2) and section 80 [failure to
attend conciliation conference], each party to a complaint shall pay his
own costs in respect of proceedings under this Act.
Notwithstanding subsection (1), the Commissioner may make an order as to
As mentioned in my reasons for decision, I take these
provisions to mean that costs should only be awarded where one of the parties
has caused the other party costs because of some unreasonable action. More
precisely and after considering the submissions, the
position is that costs
should only be awarded in exceptional circumstances. Thus the general practice
should be that each party
bears their own costs. The "exceptional
circumstances" would exist if, for example, one of the parties had attempted
some kind of
fraud or improper concealment or had taken some extreme action
which caused the other party unnecessary expense or had engaged in
In this matter I find that the Kunballanjnja Community
Government Council did not, excepting on one occasion, engage in any conduct
which would mean that any exceptional circumstance exists that would justify me
departing from the general principle that parties
must bear their own costs. In
terms of most of the submissions made I make the following findings:
• there was no direction under section 80 that there be a conciliation
conference. Therefore, the duty to consider awarding
costs under that section
does not apply. Additionally, I do not consider that a general failure to
co-operate for the purposes of
conciliation is a ground for the awarding of
• the late filing of a defence is not an exceptional circumstance
unless, at a minimum, it can be shown that the lateness caused
some cost to the
Constable Funnell. If this could be shown (which it was not) then there might
be some need to investigate the reasons
for the late defence.
• I do not consider that the case raised particularly complex or novel
legal issues. Nor am I convinced that under the Territory
Act there is any
particular reason why the losing party should be made to bear the costs of
arguing novel issues.
• that the evidence of Mr Tom Kairupan was not such as mean that there
is an "exceptional circumstance". It was unexceptional
that there was evidence
that there were other reasons (than the anti discrimination complaint) for the
sending of the letter. I make
this finding notwithstanding the fact that
Kunballanjnja Community Government Council provided little credible evidence or
as to the real reasons for the existence of the letter and the
conversations that formed the basis of the allegation of victimisation.
lack of a credible defence to the allegation combined with the telling of
exaggerated tales about the relationship between Constable
Funnell and the
community do not, of themselves, make for exceptional circumstances. I found
that Mr Kairupan gave an exaggerated
account of what might have been the reasons
for the sending of the letter given that he did not have first hand knowledge as
the original letter was sent.
The one exceptional aspect is that
of the additional interim hearing and the delay caused to the time of the final
hearing because
the Kunballanjnja Community Government Council advised of the
death of a senior person in the community. This application was brought
considered by the Commissioner as a matter of urgency. In my view later events
showed that there was no death of any relevance
to the date of the hearing of
the complaint.
Accordingly, I find that Kunballanjnja Community
Government Council should be liable for only the party/party costs on the scale
by the Local Court caused to Constable Funnell:
1. In having to brief lawyers to attend the hearing before Commissioner
Lawrie relating to the postponement of the final hearing
2. In matters
consequential to that postponement.
These costs should be as agreed or in
the absence of agreement should be as taxed by me or by a person agreed to by
the parties.
