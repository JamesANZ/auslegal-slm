SCC provides the following detail:
Recommendation 1: That the Fairway Rise nursing home takes appropriate action to ensure, to the extent possible, that residents who
are assessed as requiring hip protectors are fitted with them at all times when required.
Since this incident, Fairway Rise has implemented continuous improvement activity to ensure that, to the extent possible, all residents
who are assessed as requiring hip protectors are fitted with them at all times (Attachment 1).
In summary, these actions include:
▪ audit of all residents at the home to identify those requiring hip protectors vs available protectors
▪ purchase of additional stock where required
▪ improved documentation on resident care plans about need for hip protectors, where they are stored, and how to access additional
equipment if required
The incident, and Coroners recommendations have been shared with all SCC homes through the Clinical Committee.
To ensure that residents requiring hip protectors are identified, the home has implemented a local falls committee group, for ongoing
and identification and review of frequent fallers and those at high risk of falls and falls with injury. Regional (North and South)
falls committees have been formed, led by the Quality Team. Information from falls committees at the local level feeds into these
committees, to ensure that learnings from falls are shared and initiatives to reduce the risk of falls and falls with injury are implemented.
In reviewing the recommendations and actions implemented, SCC does note, that there is not a requirement under the Quality of Care
Principles 2014 to provide hip protectors for residents (Attachment 2 – p 56 - 60). While, as a result of this incident, the home
purchased and provided hip protectors, on an ongoing action, the home communicates with the resident and/or their nominees to gain
consent for purchase of hip protectors as an out-of-pocket expense on the resident’s behalf. Where the resident/nominee declines
to incur this cost, this will be documented in the risk assessment.
It is noted that evidence on the effectiveness of hip protectors to reduce hip fractures is mixed.
Farrell and Walter (2021) conducted a review of evidence-based literature and referenced three key guidelines in the use of hip protectors.
Essentially, indicating that there was mixed evidence of effectiveness and recommendations for use and that these recommendations
were also impacted by compliance with wearing hip protectors.
The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners published guidelines in March 2024 that identified there was moderate-quality
evidence for a small reduction in hip fracture risk when hip protectors were implemented for residents in residential aged care facilities.
This was an update to the previous guidelines from 2017 which recommended ‘use of hip protectors should be judicious, as it is
not possible to abolish the risk of falls and fracture in most elderly people. It should be noted that hip protectors do no work
when not used. Compliance is crucial.’ (Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, 2017 p: 63).
Consequently, SCC remains committed to comprehensive falls risk assessment and the implementation of a range of person-centred care
strategies to reduce the risk of falls and the risk of injury from falls. These strategies will include consideration of the appropriateness
of use of hip protectors, and enablement, to the extent possible, that residents who are assessed as requiring hip protectors are
fitted with them at all times when required.
