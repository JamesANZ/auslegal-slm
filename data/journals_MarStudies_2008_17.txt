energy force majeure: Nigeria’s local problem with global
consequences
Mikhail Kashubsky
On Thursday 19 June 2008, Royal Dutch Shell’s
floating production storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) was
attacked by armed militants. This forced the company to shut down the
production at its main offshore oil field in Nigeria.
Bonga oil field is located 120 km south-west of the Niger Delta, in water
depth of more than 1,000 metres. The Bonga development was
the first deepwater
energy project in Nigeria. The average daily production capacity of the field is
approximately 200,000 barrels
of oil and 150 million standard cubic feet of
Shell’s key facility in the region. It acts as a flow station and the hub
of the field.

The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Movement for the
Emancipation of Niger Delta (MEND), the most high-profile militant
group in the
region. It is dedicated to armed struggle in order to achieve localised control
of Nigeria’s oil and to secure
reparations from the national government
for pollution caused by the oil
It was reported that at about 1:00 am around two dozen armed men in
speedboats stormed the floating facility and after failing to
get access inside
they started shooting at FPSO and those on board. Some people were wounded, but
no lives were lost. The attack
lasted for almost four hours, during which the
militants also encountered and hijacked an offshore support vessel and kidnapped
US captain, but released him later that
The Bonga attack is one of the latest incidents in the series of attacks
carried out by MEND over past few years. This incident will
certainly take its
place in the history of offshore oil and gas security. The attack sent
shockwaves through the oil industry. Some
security experts described it as

In early September 2008, MEND declared an ‘oil war’ on the
Nigerian government and the oil
leading to some of the
worst violence in the past two years. MEND promised to ‘continue to nibble
every day at the oil infrastructure
in Nigeria until the oil exports reach

On 15 September and 16 September 2008 MEND destroyed a section of Shell oil
pipeline and shooting was also reported near Chevron-operated
platform, causing Chevron to evacuate offshore workers as a
precaution.
On 16 September 2008, MEND (allegedly in joint operation with another
militant group) travelling in eight speed boats bombed with
dynamite and hand
grenades the Orubiri pumping station operated by a unit of Royal Dutch Shell
causing substantial damage to the
facility, and also attacked a nearby naval
vessel with 10 people on
On or about 19 September 2008, militants blew up a major pipeline owned by
Shell in the Asari Toru region.
It should be noted that not all of the attacks mentioned above were carried
out by MEND. There are also other militant groups operating
in the area such the
Niger Delta Vigilante (DNV) and the Niger Delta People’s Volunteer Force
(NDPVF), as well criminal gangs
and pirates. Some critics refer to all militants
as simply criminal gangs that try to extort money from the oil companies.
Consequences of the oil attacks
These pipeline bombings, kidnappings, oilfield raids, and more recent attacks
on offshore platforms have reduced Nigeria’s production
by about 25 per
cent since early 2006. This is significant because Nigeria is the world’s
eighth-largest oil exporter, but
it is currently producing well below its oil
potential, largely due to this violent campaign of the
The country is currently losing an average of 650,000 barrels of crude oil
production a day.
leading energy experts, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates,
referred to the situation in Niger Delta
as ‘one of the key oil security
issues in the world
These militant
attacks and temporary production shutdowns have also contributed to sky-high
global oil prices.
The frequency and the success rate of the attacks have forced some companies
such as Shell and Chevron to declare force majeure until
further notice, which
releases them from contractual obligations on their crude oil shipments from
Niger Delta.
It is also estimated that more than 400 oil workers have been kidnapped in
Niger Delta in the past three years, but most were released
unharmed. However,
some attacks resulted in hostage deaths and casualties among Nigerian
Nigeria’s large oil reserves are being held hostage by this violent
unrest. The militants, MEND in particular, have demonstrated
their continuing
ability to disrupt production from Nigeria’s onshore fields. Many oil
companies have found it too dangerous
to operate in the region and some have
closed down their operations.
Nevertheless, the future of the Nigerian oil industry is offshore. Nigeria is
considered to be one of the few countries with geological
potential to
significantly increase its offshore petroleum production. Oil companies have
been focusing on offshore production and
due to security concerns onshore many
have transferred some of their operations offshore in recent years.
Approximately 1.25 million
barrels per day of offshore petroleum is scheduled
for production in the next six years in
Attacking offshore facilities is a relatively new trend of the militants
because these types of attacks, especially attacks on facilities
offshore areas, are generally more complicated to carry out and therefore
occurred less frequently in the
However, after the attack
the oil industry and the government of Nigeria are seriously
and legitimately concerned for the security of deep-water petroleum
which represent the future of the Nigerian energy industry.
Significance of the Bonga attack
There are several factors that make this attack significant and unique.
First, the most direct impact of the attack was the physical
damage to the
facility consequently forcing Shell to shut down production from its flagship
project. The closing of the production
from the Bonga field alone reduced the
nation’s oil producing capacity by 10 per
In other words,
of Nigeria’s oil production was crippled in
Second, the Bonga attack caused fears of supply disruption in Nigeria and has
contributed to the rise in global oil prices to over
It attracted more media
coverage than any other offshore attack. This certainly achieved one of the
militant’s goals of raising
the awareness of their campaign.
Another very important aspect of this attack was the demonstration of
MEND’s capabilities in the offshore environment. Militants
travelled more
than 120 km during the night through strong currents, carried out the attack,
which lasted almost four hours, and
travelled back another 120 km. It is not
exactly known what types of boats were used in the attack, but the distance of
the deepwater
projects, such as Bonga, from the coast led oil companies to
assume that they would not be at risk from militant attacks, at least
frequently as facilities located in the shallow waters. Analysts also previously
believed that these kind of deep water projects
are out of militants’
reach. This is no longer the case.
MEND often communicates with international media and sends emails about its
attacks on oil infrastructure, the details of which are
usually later confirmed
by oil companies and the
government.
The MEND commander,
in an exclusive interview with
confirmed that his organisation
carried out the attack leading to the shutdown, and that the attack was partly
carried out to demonstrate
that they have such capability. He further
the truth is that they are taking their production offshore, where they think
that the military will protect them, that is part of
the reason we went there to
tell them that no place is safe for them in the Niger-Delta… I have told
you that we will cripple
the oil facilities in the region … And because we
have made our point by coming to where they think we cannot get to, I decided
tell the other fighters that we should go. If not, we were armed with enough
Rocket Propelled Grenades and other weapons to bring
it down. … We know
everything about FPSO before we went there. Nobody should delude
remote offshore oil fields had always been considered difficult for most
militants to attack. This was a departure from the usual
practices of oil
militants who have generally targeted petroleum facilities onshore and in the
shallow waters of Niger Delta.
The Bonga attack established a precedent and potentially raised the prospect
of a new campaign of violence by the militants in the
offshore areas of Niger
Delta. Possibly, it also set an example for terrorist organisations, which have
already considered offshore
installations as potential targets. Some analysts
now say that it is likely that these kinds of attacks are going to become a
The prediction of analysts was recently confirmed. The Commander of the
Nigerian military Joint Task Force (JTF) announced that his
command averted an
attempt by militants on 30 July 2008 to carry out another attack on the Bonga
field, and as soon as intelligence
of the planned attack was received, the
military deployed a naval vessel in the area within six

discusses in some detail
the significance of this particular attack and whether such an attack could
potentially cause damage to

Piper Alpha
explosion in 1988, which tragically resulted in 167 deaths, enormous financial
losses, and marine pollution.
He argues that
exploitation of the vulnerabilities are within the reach of a group like MEND
… it is probably not beyond MEND’s near-term
capability to inflict
significant, lasting damage to Nigeria’s offshore
facilities.
further suggests that militants could learn from this attack and increase their
offshore capabilities in the future, and highlights
‘three significant and
separate advances by MEND: targeting, naval equipment, and training’.
Perhaps another important capability demonstrated by this attack is
intelligence gathering. MEND had confirmed that they have the
map and chart of
all offshore installations in Niger Delta and know the topography of the
Such an attack
demonstrates the high level of sophistication of these militant groups, probably
higher than an average terrorist
cell would have, but more importantly, it
demonstrates the Nigerian navy’s inability to protect offshore
installations in their
Additional offshore security measures
Nigeria was the first country in Africa to comply with the
International
Ship and Port Facility Security Code
(ISPS Code). However, the problem is
now far beyond regulatory solution, at least in terms of maritime security
regulation. Nigeria
is now the world’s ‘hot spot’ for attacks
on the offshore industry.
The Bonga attack, as well as previous attacks on offshore facilities, reveal
that the existing physical security arrangements such
as anti-climb paint,
industrial safety blast walls, and the Nigerian navy capabilities, including
24-hour navy patrols, are inadequate
in light of the escalating unrest and
violence in the region.
Accordingly, tougher security measures are required. Oil companies operating
in offshore Nigeria need take action to enhance the security
arrangements of
their offshore installations.
Some oil companies already took additional measures to boost security
measures around offshore facilities. Apparently, one company
has coated the
pylons of a giant oil production platform, located 130 km offshore, with
waterproof grease to prevent attackers from
climbing the
Some security experts suggested installing reinforced floating blast-proof
barriers or walls that are used to control access to offshore
sites, and long
range acoustic warning devices (LRAD) technology to fire high-frequency warning
sound beams at militant boats and
other unauthorised
However, such measures should be just a small part of a much bigger strategy.
For example, the Nigerian naval forces would also require
faster patrol boats
with mounted machine-guns in order to protect offshore facilities and engage the
hostiles more effectively.
Conclusions
The militants in Niger Delta have become more sophisticated and better
equipped. They have now proven that all of Nigeria’s
facilities are within
their reach, at least in terms of distance. It is likely that key offshore
facilities would be their primary
Onshore petroleum production in Nigeria is already mature, and if the
militants continue to attack key offshore petroleum installations
significantly interrupt Nigeria’s offshore petroleum production, the
future of Nigeria as the major global energy player
looks bleak.
