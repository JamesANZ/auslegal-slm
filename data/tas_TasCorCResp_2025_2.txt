Response received by Department of State Growth 19 May 2025
Regarding your recommendations in relation to warning signs in circumstances where road works or road conditions pose a hazard to
cyclists by the presence of debris on a road surface, and risk assessments for roadworks that impact the safety of cyclists as a
vulnerable road user, in addition to other road users across the State’s road network.
I can advise that officers within the Transport Group at the Department of State Growth have reviewed the department’s construction
specifications for state road projects in conjunction with your recommendations. Section 160.07 of these specifications requires
that a traffic management plan be developed for each construction project and states the standards and guidelines to be utilised
when developing their plan.
This specification requires, in part, adherence to the latest version of the Austroads Guide to Temporary Traffic Management (the
Guide), which provide instructions for how vulnerable road users, including cyclists, are to be considered in temporary traffic management
plans. The department has confirmed in their review that the safety measures in this Guide relating to vulnerable road users are
in accordance with your recommendations.
The Guide provides considerations and tools for how vulnerable road users, including cyclists, are to be considered when identifying
risks and appropriate mitigations, including signage, for a temporary traffic management plan.
In turn, while the department’s construction specifications already incorporate your recommendations, the department will send a
notification reminding contractors that signage during on-going works needs to be specific to the site and consider vulnerable road
I can also advise that the Department of State Growth currently administers the Vulnerable
Road User Program, which provides an opportunity for Tasmanian local governments to apply
for grant funding to implement low-cost infrastructure treatments that improve road safety
outcomes for vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, etc.). Treatments typically delivered
under this program include footpaths, pedestrian refuges, cycling paths and pedestrian
