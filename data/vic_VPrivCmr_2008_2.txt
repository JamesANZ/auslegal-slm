2008 VPrivCmr 2
The Complaint
In 2006 the Complainant was contacted by the Department and asked to provide
address details for a specific purpose. The Department
also contacted the
Complainant’s relative and asked for the relative’s address details
for the same, specified purpose.
The Complainant subsequently provided address
to the Department.
In 2007, a representative of the Department attended the Complainant’s
relative’s residence and attempted to serve a subpoena
on the Complainant
at this address. The Complainant’s relative advised the Department’s
representative that the Complainant
did not reside at the address and had never
resided at that address.
The Complainant subsequently contacted the Department and enquired as to why
the Department had attempted to serve the subpoena at
the relative’s
address. The Department informed the Complainant that the relative’s
address was the address the Department
had on record as the Complainant’s
address. The Complainant again provided the correct address to the Department.
Later in 2007, the Complainant wrote to the Department and provided a postal
address as the address for return correspondence. In
early 2008, the Department
wrote a letter of response to the Complainant and sent it to the
Complainant’s relative’s
(now former) residential address. The
letter contained the Complainant’s personal information.
The Complainant believed that the Department’s failure to correctly
record the Complainant’s postal address and to update
Complainant’s address details when informed of the mistake constituted a
failure to take reasonable steps to ensure the
personal information it
collected, used and disclosed was accurate, complete and up to date.
The Complainant also believed the Department – in attending the
incorrect address to serve the subpoena and sending correspondence
incorrect address – failed to take reasonable steps to protect the
Complainant’s personal information from misuse,
loss and unauthorised
access and disclosure.
Response to Complaint
The Department stated that its records indicated that in 2006 the Complainant
provided the relative’s address as the contact
address for the specific
purpose. The Department, however, acknowledged that the Complainant’s
address could have been verified
prior to sending a representative to serve the
Complaint with a subpoena.
The Department acknowledged that correspondence for the Complainant had been
inadvertently sent to the Complainant’s relative’s
former address in
spite of being informed by the Complainant that this was not the correct
address. On this basis, the Department
submitted that it would like to engage
the Complainant in a discussion to outline the steps taken by the Department to
improve the
quality and security of the personal information it collects, uses
and discloses.
The Privacy Commissioner considered that the Department’s failure to
update the Complainant’s address information raised
issues under IPP 3 and
that the use of an incorrect address to send correspondence to the Complainant
raised issues under IPP 4.
On this basis, the Commissioner referred the
complaint to conciliation.
At conciliation, the Department agreed to provide the Complainant with a
formal apology and to make a note on the Complainant’s
file to verify the
accuracy of the Complainant’s contact details prior to sending any future
correspondence to the Complainant.
In addition, the Department agreed to
undertake a data cleansing exercise to ensure the accuracy of all the personal
information
contained within the Complainant’s file.
