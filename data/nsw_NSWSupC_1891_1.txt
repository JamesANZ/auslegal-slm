Prior v Anderson [1891] NSWSupC 1 (9 July 1891)
[breach of promise of marriage, civil procedure, change of venue, slander]
Prior v. Anderson
Supreme Court of New South Wales
Foster J., 13 May 1891
Sydney Morning Herald
, 14 May 1891, p. 3
In Chambers. - (Before his Honor Mr. Justice Foster.)
PRIOR V. ANDERSON
Mr. Butterworth appeared for defendant and applied for a change of venue from Sydney to Bathurst. Mr. C.B. Stephen appeared for plaintiff
to oppose the motion. The action is one for breach of promise of marriage brought by Miss J. Prior, who resides in the Western district,
against John Anderson grazier, of Killongbutta station, near Bathurst, and the damages claimed are �5000. The change of venue was
asked for on the grounds that Bathurst would be a more convenient place for trial for the parties and their witnesses, and also a
less expensive. The plaintiff, on the other hand, desired that the hearing should take place in Sydney, as, owing to the nature of
the defence, she was anxious that delayed should be avoided. Some correspondence between the parties was read, from which it appeared
that defendant had informed that the plaintiff of certain rumours which had reached him affecting her character, and requested her
to disprove them. He added that, if she could do so, he was perfectly willing to marry her.
His Honor thought sufficient reason had not been shown for changing the venue, and he therefore dismissed the application, with costs.
