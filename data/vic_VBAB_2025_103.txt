) pursuant to
Building Act 1993
the owner (
) of 77 Patyah Street, Diamond Creek (
) requiring the Applicant to show cause why either:
a) a building extension (
) erected to the front of the house
situated on the Subject Land should not be demolished and removed; or
b) the Applicant should not provide evidence that the Extension is structurally
sound and compliant with the Building Code of Australia
Building Regulations 2018
Regulations
set out in the Building Notice, the Respondent opined that the following
circumstances existed:
The following building work

have considered the parties’ detailed oral and written submissions, and
the material filed with the BAB.
have also had regard to:
Building Act 1993
Building Regulations 2018
the Regulations

note the stated objectives of the Act are set out in s 4, which includes the
objectives to:
a) protect the safety and health of people who use buildings;
b) enhance the amenity of buildings; and
c) facilitate the adoption and efficient application of national building
regard to all the submission and materials in the BAB, including those set out
above, we make the following findings.
Respondent’s statutory powers to serve the building notice derives from s
106 of the Act which provides that:
...a municipal building surveyor
or a private building surveyor
may cause a building notice
to be served on an owner of
a building,
land on which building
work is being or is proposed to be carried out or a place of public
entertainment if the building surveyor
is of the opinion that any one of the following circumstances exists—
(a) building
has been carried out on the
land or place without a
required by this
Act, or in contravention of a building permit
or this Act or the
building regulations;
the use of the
place contravenes
regulations;
(ba) safety or emergency services, installations
or equipment have not been maintained in accordance with the occupancy
the regulations;
(c) the building or
place is unfit for occupation or for use as a place of public
entertainment;
(d) the building,
land or place or building
work on the building,
land or place is a danger to the life, safety or health of any
member of the
public or of any person using the building,
land or place or to any property
[Emphasis Added].
108 of the Act provides that a building notice:
(1A) ...may require
the owner of a building, land or place of public entertainment to show cause
within a specified period why the
owner should not carry out building work,
protection work or work required by the regulations in relation to the building,
(2) ...must be in writing and contain any matters required by the
regulations.
179 of the Regulations further provides that for the purposes of s108(2) of the
Act, a building notice must include:
(a) the location
of the building or place of public entertainment to which the notice applies;
(b) the name and address of the owner to whom or which the notice is
directed; and
(c) the reason or reasons why the notice was served; and
(d) the date of any inspection of the building, land or place
of public entertainment carried out or relied on by the relevant
surveyor when deciding whether to serve the notice (if applicable); and
(e) the name and qualifications of any person other than the
relevant building surveyor who carries out an inspection referred
paragraph (d); and
(f) the date of making of the notice; and
(g) the name and address of the relevant building surveyor.
Respondent’s submissions, in summary, asserts that the Building Notice was
validly issued under the Act and the Regulations
a) contained the Respondent’s reasonable opinion that, in the absence of
further evidence, the Extension either did not have
a building permit and/or was
erected in contravention of the Regulations as required by s 106 of the Act;
b) set out requirements on the Applicant to show cause as required by s 108(1A)
of the Act; and
c) was in writing and contained all the information set out in reg 179 as
required by s 108(2) of the Act.
Applicant’s submissions are summarised along the following, key heads of
a) there were extenuating circumstances to the Extension being built, including
but not limited to:
flooding at Mr Mark Pelley’s (
Applicant’s Son
health issues and injuries of Ms Aishah Pelley and Ms Aeve Pelley
Applicant’s Granddaughters
) and the Applicant’s son;
Applicant’s advanced age; and
and security for the Applicant’s family;
b) building requirements disagreement with the Building Notice, including but
not limited to:
similarities
between the Extension and shipping containers, which the Applicant asserts are
modular method and materials used to construct the Extension; and
Extension use being temporary, despite evidence shoing the Extension erected for
over 12 months;
is bias and discrimination against the Applicant as other properties had similar
or lesser setbacks;
d) not appropriate or unreasonable due to an asserted Australian and/or
Victorian housing crisis;
e) want of jurisdiction as the Subject Land is:
the process of an Indigenous Australian heritage site application; and/or
application pursuant to the Equal Opportunity Commission;
f) is inconsistent with international treaties and conventions that Australia is
a signatory to, including but not limited to:
International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights human rights;
Convention on the Rights of the Child
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities;
g) inconsistencies with Commonwealth laws pursuant to section 109 of the
Commonwealth of Australia
Constitution
Act 1900 (Cth) (
Constitution
“[n]o body cares”
as there is no impact to Nillumbik
Council nor has any neighbour raised any issues with the Extension,
collectively referred to herein as the
Applicant’s
Submissions
have considered the Applicant’s Submissions in detail and find that on the
balance of probabilities they are unfounded and
do not invalidate the Building
Notice or the Respondent’s power to issue the Building Notice pursuant to
the Act and Regulations.
Applicant’s Submissions do not:
a) directly address the validity of the Building Notice or the
Respondent’s power under the Act and Regulations;
b) evidence any changed circumstances to the issues identified in the Building
Notice that would invalidate or contradict the reasonable
opinions of the
Respondent as set out in the Building Notice; or
c) address the Building Notice’s request to show cause, which was a
request to provide further information as required by the
Notice, not a decision
to demolish or remove the Extension.
Applicant’s Submissions amount to mere assertions that the Building
Notice, even if valid, does not apply to the Applicant
or the Extension simply
due to the Applicant family’s personal circumstances.
each of the key heads of reasons to the Applicant’s Submissions in turn,
the BAB finds that in relation to:
a) extenuating circumstances –
we have genuine concern for the Applicant’s family situation, including
the Applicant’s granddaughters’
health and safety, the asserted
extenuating circumstances to the Extension being built and/or required may
explain why the Extension
was built but it does not invalidate the Building
Notice, the Respondent’s opinion or exempt the Applicant from answering
Building Notice.
the Applicant’s submissions in this regard were accepted and taken to
their logical conclusion, then any person with any
injury, concern for safety,
special needs, age or other alleged circumstance could simply ignore a Building
Notice, the Act or the
Regulations.
logical extension of this argument would also allow owners or occupants of all
other types of buildings – such as hospitals
that house the sick, rooming
houses that house the homeless, retirement villages that house the elderly or
special needs facilities
that house the less able – to ignore the Act and
the Regulations.
is not the case and in fact such buildings have their own, often more stringent,
building compliance requirements due to the
particular needs of its
Act and the Regulations are there to regulate and ensure minimum standards of
safety, amenity and other issues are maintained
within the building industry and
all buildings, including the Extension.
regulations and standards may differ depending on the particular building and
its use, but they must still be complied with.
b) building requirements disagreement –
Submissions
Applicant do not address why the Building Notice
ought not be served or why it
is invalid.
simply not up to the Applicant to unilaterally decide whether or not the
Extensions, including the construction methodology
or materials used, are
required or not required, or do or do not comply with the Building Notice, the
Act or the Regulations.
the Applicant’s submissions reinforce the need for the Building Notice so
that the Respondent can obtain information
from the Applicant about the
Extension to ensure the type of building, construction materials and use of the
Extension is in accordance
with the Act and the Regulations.
otherwise would be untenable and result in an unregulated building industry that
would allow the Applicant and others in the
community to self-regulate and
police the construction of buildings based on idiosyncratic and unilateral
circumstances and beliefs.
or discrimination –
was no bias or discrimination by the Respondent in deciding to serve the
Building Notice as the minimum setback required on
the Subject Land is, as the
Respondent submitted, a factual calculation as set out in reg 74 of the
Regulations and based on the
Subject Land’s immediate neighbouring
properties.
Applicant’s contention that the setbacks of other buildings in the street
are less may be relevant to whether the Extension
is subject to an exemption, if
the Respondent subsequently determines the Extension does not comply.
such submissions do not invalidate the service of the Building Notice which was
served in order to obtain such information
in the first
d) asserted housing crisis –
to our findings that personal circumstances do not invalidate the valid issuance
of a Building Notice and exercise of the
Respondent’s powers under the
Act, we do not accept that a mere assertion that societal circumstances, such as
a housing crisis,
ought to circumvent an act of Parliament that has been in
operation for decades and which aim to regulate the building industry to
housing is safe.
the community and Parliament was similarly concerned as the Applicant, the
proper avenue is to amend the law by Parliament.
cannot be that any individual member of the public, such as the Applicant, can
unilaterally choose to ignore the law simply because
it asserts it requires
housing must be safe and built to sufficient standards and compliance as set out
in the Act and the Regulations.
e) Australian Indigenous heritage and the Equal Opportunity Commission
protection applications –
from a mere assertion of want of jurisdiction and repetition of sections within
these laws, no evidence or specific details
was provided by the Applicant as to
how applications under either the:
and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1948
Opportunity Act 2010
directly voided the jurisdiction of the Act or the Regulations.
section or provision of these laws, including those quoted by the Applicant,
expressly or implicitly state that operation of one
excludes all the others,
including exclusion of the Act or Regulations.
the laws submitted by the Applicant may apply to the Applicant’s family
situation, they do not expressly reference
the Act or the Regulations and as
such, without more, does not bring into question the operation of Building
Notice, the Act or the
Regulations.
f) inconsistency with international treaties and conventions:
aside from a mere assertion of conflict and repetition of sections within these
conventions, no evidence or specific details
were provided by the Applicant as
to how either the:
International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights human rights;
Convention on the Rights of the Child
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities;
takek precedence over, was mutually exclusive of or somehow voided the
the treaties cited by the Applicant may be relevant to the Applicant’s
family situation, they do not expressly reference
the Act or the Regulations and
as such, without more, does not bring into question the operation of Building
Notice, the Act or the
Regulations.
g) inconsistency with Commonwealth laws –
Constitution
in full provides:
When a law of a State is
inconsistent
with a law of the
Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall,
extent of the inconsistency
, be invalid [Emphasis added].
that the Applicant asserts the various Commonwealth laws and
international treaties referenced by the Application – some of
referred to above – by their mere existence and the provisions set out
within them, overrides the operation of the
Building Notice, the Act and/or the
Regulations.
landmark case of
Clyde Engineering Company Limited v
established in Australian Jurisprudence the
“cover the field”
test, which is one of the tests used to determine whether state laws are
inconsistent with Commonwealth laws..
J in Clyde stated the cover the field test as
the vital question
would be: Was the [Commonwealth Act] on its true construction intended to cover
the whole ground and, therefore,
to supersede the [State Act]?....If...a
competent legislature expressly or impliedly evinces its intent to cover the
whole field,
that is a conclusive test of inconsistency where another
legislature assumes to enter to any extent upon the same
on this cover the field test, in order for the Building Notice, the Act and/or
the Regulations to be voided under the application
Constitution
there needs to be clear intent in the other laws submitted by the Applicant that
they expressly cover the whole field of building
compliance, which is the
relevant field and subject matter of the Building Notice, the Act and the
Regulation.
considering each of the laws submitted by the Applicant, twe find that although
they may apply to the Applicant’s personal
and familial circumstances,
none expressly or implicitly refer to building compliance, which is the relevant
subject matter.
the case of
Federated Sawmill Employees of Australia v James Moor and Sons
established a separate,
more specific test known as the
“simultaneous obedience”
test, namely that obedience to both the Federal and State law at the same time
must be impossible for
Constitution
considering each of the laws submitted by the Applicant, we find it is
inherently possible and indeed desirable that all the laws
simultaneously, including that it is possible for the Extension and the
Applicant to comply with the Building Notice and
the Act simultaneously whilst
complying with:
International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights;
United Nations
Convention on the Rights of the Child
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities;
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1948 (Cth); and
Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Cth),
as none of these and
Conventions and Acts directly or indirectly refer to building regulation or
compliance of buildings that creates
any conflict or inconsistency, and vice
that regard, we findthat none of the laws referred to by the Applicant meet
cover the field test; or
simultaneous obedience test.
Accordingly,
the BAB finds no inconsistency that enlivens the operation of
section 109
Constitution
in regard to the Building Notice.
h) “No body cares”
clear from, and the BAB accepts the Respondent’s evidence that the
Extension was brought to the attention of the Respondent
via an anonymous
reporting by someone in the community.
even if one accepts that the Applicant’s submission is a reasonable
argument to make, which we do not, factually
it is incorrect.
members of the community, as well as Council and the Respondent clearly do care.
They cared enough to respectively bring the
matter to Council’s attention,
send a building surveyor to inspect the Extension and to issue a Building
21. In summary, the Applicant’s submissions do not address the validity
of the Building Notice but merely assert the Building
Notice does not apply to
the Applicant due to the Applicant’s personal and familial circumstances,
which is not founded in
law and not accepted by the BAB.
Contrastingly
the Respondent’s opinions and reasons for serving the Building Notice was
that it formed a valid opinion pursuant
to s 106 of the Act that it was
reasonable to believe, in the absence of contrary evidence, that the Extension
was non-compliant
with the Regulations and was not constructed with a building
is further reasonable for the Respondent to then exercise his powers under s 106
of the Act to compel the Applicant to provide
further information by issuing the
Building Notice pursuant to section 108 of the Act.
steps beyond the issue of the Building Notice would then likely depend, at least
in part, on the responses and evidence requested
of the Applicant.
Applicant must be obliged to provide such evidence so that the Respondent can
properly exercise its statutory obligations, once
armed with all reasonable
information.
Conversely,
for procedural fairness, the Applicant ought to have and was afforded a right of
response under the Building Notice before
the Respondent makes any future
decisions regarding the Extension.
the Applicant disagreed with the substance of or the Respondent’s opinion
in the Building Notice, it could have and was well
within his rights to provide
information or evidence in answer to the Building Notice.
decisions were then subsequently made by the Respondent in relation to the
Extension, the Applicant then has rights to review those
decisions, subject to
proper compliance with its appeal rights under the Act.
the circumstances and on the balance of probabilities, we find that the Building
Notice is valid and enforceable.
affirm the Respondent’s decision to serve the Building Notice.
Nonetheless,
we further determine that the deadline for the Applicant to meet the
requirements of the Building Notice be extended
as set out in the orders to this
determination.
closing, we encourage the Applicant, if it chooses to answer the Building
Notice, to deal directly with the building compliance
issues and requests
relevant to the Building Notice, the Act and the Regulations.
OF DETERMINATION: 19 AUGUST 2025
Clause 17 of Schedule 3 to the
Building Act 1993
provides: ‘Unless the Building Appeals Board
otherwise determines, a party to a proceeding before the Board must bear his,
or its own costs’.
