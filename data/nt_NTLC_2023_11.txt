In the matter of an inquest into the death of Kumanjayi Walker

Objecting Parties
object to the receipt of the
Objecting Parties submit that the Report is so plagued by deficiencies it should
not be received. In particular they point to
deficiencies concerning the
expertise of the authors, the manner of its drafting, and its contents. As to
that latter issue, the
Objecting Parties emphasise that the Report does not
properly disclose the process of reasoning by which its conclusions were
and that the conclusions are based on inaccurate assumptions or
assertions. In light of the significant deficiencies, the Objecting
submit that the Report is not logically capable of assisting me in the discharge
of my statutory functions. Alternatively,
and to the extent that the Report is
‘so capable’, the Objecting Parties submit that it ‘should not
be received,
because any assistance [it] might provide would be outweighed by
the cost, delay, distress and other risks associated with [its]
Legal principles
Coroners Act
governs the ‘receipt’ of evidence by a
Coroner during an inquest. It provides as follows:
of evidence not binding
A coroner holding an inquest
is not bound by the rules of evidence and may be informed, and conduct the
inquest, in a manner the coroner
reasonably thinks fit.
following basic principles appear not to be in dispute:
(a) Whether a coroner may inform herself from ‘evidence’ depends on
whether she subjectively ‘thinks fit’
to do so, but her subjective
state of satisfaction must be ‘reasonable’.
disapplies the rules of evidence that might otherwise govern the
‘admission’ of evidence in an inquest.

Findings as to deficiencies in the Report
accept the submissions of the Objecting Parties that the Report is deficient as
an item of expert evidence. In summary, I find that:
I do not doubt that the authors of the Report possess relevant
‘expertise’, it is difficult to discern how the
conclusions are the product of it. Some of the ‘opinions’ –
for example, opinions that conduct did
or did not occur, or that it was or was
not motivated by racial bias – appear to be lay inferences from the
primary evidence.
Other opinions
– such as those criticising clinical decisions as
‘unreasonable’ – would seemingly require
expertise that most
of the authors do not have.
Finally, each of the authors is said to possess very
expertise. Assuming that the opinions
based in relevant
expertise, this begs the question: how am I to assess whether this is the
expertise of one, some or all of the

problematic,
difficulties arise

each having relevant expertise or
‘compromised opinions’. In this context, ‘compromised
opinions’ have been
described as ‘opinions reached as a result of
decision [by one author] to “adopt” an opinion’ by another,
where the ‘opinion is not the result of an application of the specialised
knowledge of [the first

authors and the differences between their areas of expertise, raises this as a

is not clear what materials the authors have reviewed. The authors state that
they were provided with the brief of evidence and
that they ‘undertook a
collaborative
analysis’ of
This suggests that different
authors may have been responsible for reviewing different materials and that
each author may have had
an incomplete understanding of the evidence. That
possibility is seemingly consistent with the attempt, in the Supplementary
to explain various factual inaccuracies in the Report on the basis that
the brief of evidence was ‘voluminous’ and ‘difficult
although the authors criticise NTPF and NT Health, they make no reference to any
consideration of the written evidence of
a number of significant institutional
witnesses. Finally, the extent to which each of the authors kept abreast of the
evidence (if at all) is unclear.
(d) On some significant matters, the Report fails to expose the process of
reasoning by which, and the assumptions upon which, its
conclusions are based.
For example, the Report cites the ‘concerningly high’ number of use
of force incidents (46) in
which Constable Rolfe was involved as evidence of the
NTPF’s failures to appropriately supervise and/or discipline Constable
Rolfe. The conclusion that 46 Use of Force incidents is ‘concerningly
high’ may be true, or it may not, but the authors
do not explain by what
metric or comparison their conclusion has been reached, and they point to no
evidence that would allow for
such a conclusion.
Report contains significant factual inaccuracies which have formed the basis, or
part of the basis, for its conclusions. For example,
the Report concludes that
the portrayal by NTPF and NT Health of the community of Yuendumu as
‘presenting a continuing physical
threat to staff’ was unreasonable
and, ultimately, reflected a racial

that conclusion – that ‘there was no evidence in the health

objectively false.
Likewise, the
Report offers numerous opinions about the conduct of Constable Rolfe and the
NTPF that are based on objectively false
assumptions. For example, the Report
concludes that the NTPF ‘comprehensively failed to hold Rolfe to account
at least 12 known and 64 further instances of alleged
misconduct’
Supplementary Report the authors clarify that the figure ‘64’ was a
‘typographical error’ and should
have been ‘46’. Even
so, on no reasonable view could that figure be said to record ‘instances
of alleged misconduct’.
Similarly, the authors assert that Constable Rolfe
has a ‘violent criminal history’, including a ‘criminal

Reports’ conclusions.

common law developed strict exclusionary rules to govern the admissibility of
expert evidence. Among them were requirements that:
(a) There be a field of specialised knowledge;
(b) By reason of their training, study or experience, the witness has become an
expert in an aspect of that field;
(c) The opinion be wholly or substantially based on the witnesses’ expert

other ‘opinions’ received during the inquest. Those

necessary assessment of probative value would be

authors, and in that way to allow ‘matters that might detract from their

interested parties.’
cannot ignore the ‘practical difficulties’ associated with that
proposal. In this case if I were to inquire into the
probative value of the
Report and hear from the authors, I would need to convene a special sitting of
the inquest. A conservative
estimate is that the process would take a full week
of court time (four days of evidence and one day of submissions) and, in light
of listing pressures, would delay the conclusion of the inquest until well into
2024. In light of the identified deficiencies in
the Report, I do not have
sufficient confidence in its value, or the evidence that might be given by its
authors, to justify the
expense and delay that would be associated with such an

its original written submissions, NT Health emphasised that the Report was
beyond the scope of an ‘issues list’ agreed
between the Counsel
Assisting and the interested parties in May 2022 (but later abandoned in
September 2022). I did not understand
this to be a submission that I could not
receive the Report because I lacked power to investigate the nexus, if any,
between any
evidence of institutional racism within NT Health and the
circumstances of Kumanjayi’s death. Instead, I understood these
submissions
to make what I find to be a justifiable criticism of the
circumstances in which NAAJA provided the Report.
