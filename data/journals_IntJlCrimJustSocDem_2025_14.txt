Introduction
find myself sitting on the ground in a round hut at the Women’s
Association for Victims’ Empowerment (WAVE) in January
2023, surrounded by
a group of women of all ages. The cool concrete floor contrasts with the heat
outside, and a fan slowly whirs
in the ceiling, its gentle breeze offering some
relief. I am here to investigate how families of victims of enforced
disappearance
navigate mourning and memory in the absence of bodies or formal
closure. Together with WAVE, we organized this gathering to create
a space for
women to share their experiences, stories of loss, resilience, and the enduring
part of a broader ethnographic study on
mourning, memory, and justice among the relatives of enforced disappearance
victims. During
this fieldwork, I conducted semi-structured interviews, focus
group discussions, and participant observation with family members,
and civil society actors engaged in transitional justice efforts. The goal was
to document personal narratives of loss,
explore how families cope with the
absence of their loved ones, and examine their engagement with the Truth,
Reconciliation and Reparations
Commission’s (TRRC) findings and
recommendations.
Among those gathered are women whose husbands, sons, brothers, and fathers
disappeared during Yahya Jammeh’s regime (1994–2017).
The circular
arrangement of our seating creates an intimate space, conducive to sharing and
listening. The meeting begins with a
quiet murmur, gradually building as more
women lend their voices to discussion. Halima, who lost her brother to
Jammeh’s Junglers,
takes the lead. Her presence is commanding, her voice
strong despite the underlying pain. As she speaks, the weight of her words
the room, revealing not only the personal toll of disappearance but also its
wider emotional and social impact on entire communities.
She questions the
future of transitional justice in a tone that reflects both urgency and
disillusionment:
‘The TRRC is finished. There are lots of victims out there. What is the
Government going to do about these victims?’ TRRC
moo jeex na [is
What next? What body is
going to be there to take up the leftovers of what the TRRC has done? ... If the
victims do not take the
forefront, the Government will not take it for us.
(Halima, personal communication, 2023)
Halima’s words resonate deeply within the circle, evident in the subtle
shifts in posture — some women straighten, others
lean in, elbows resting
on their knees, as if drawn closer by a shared urgency. A murmur of agreement
ripples through the group,
punctuated by quiet but firm “bilai, naa
true” [I swear, that’s true]. Some women press their hands into the
concrete floor, steadying themselves, while others glance at one another
knowingly, their expressions heavy with the weight of lived
experience. A few
let out deep sighs, shaking their heads, their eyes fixed on the ground. The
energy in the room shifts, no longer
just a space of recollection but one of
collective reckoning. The fan above us continues its slow, steady rotation, a
gentle reminder
of the relentless passage of time. “They really exclude
the victims,” another woman adds, her voice filled with resignation.
“They do. I think it’s human nature,” Halima responds, her
tone reflecting a weary acceptance of the harsh realities
As I listen to their voices, I am reminded of a passage from Toni
(1987), a novel that explores the haunting
legacies of slavery in the United States. Sethe, the novel’s protagonist,
is a formerly
enslaved woman who struggles with the trauma of her past and the
loss of her daughter. In one scene, she experiences an overwhelming
collective power:
For Sethe it was as though the Clearing had come to her with all its heat and
simmering leaves, where the voices of women searched
for the right combination,
the key, the code, the sound that broke the back of words. Building voice upon
voice until they found
it, and when they did it was a wave of sound wide enough
to sound deep water and knock the pods off chestnut trees. It broke over
and she trembled like the baptized in its wash. (Morrison, 1987, p. 261)
Here, Sethe is engulfed in a collective expression of grief, healing, and
transformation, an experience mirrored here in this hut
at WAVE. The voices of
these women build upon one another, searching for that combination, the key, the
code to break through the
silence and inaction. Their collective sound is
powerful, a swell of determination and resilience. It is a moment of solidarity
strength that envelops us all, much like the wave that broke over Sethe,
leaving us trembling in its wake. Back at WAVE, Halima speaks
again, her voice
weaving through the shared experiences like a thread pulling together a
patchwork quilt. She reminds the women of
the importance of their unity, of
continuing the fight for recognition and justice. The TRRC may have concluded
its hearings, but
their struggle is far from over. The conversation ebbs and
flows, punctuated by shared memories, grievances, and sporadic silences.
woman’s voice adds another layer to the collective narrative, a tapestry
woven with threads of loss, anger, and resilience.
This metaphor of weaving, of voices entwining like threads in a quilt,
connects to a long history of conflict textiles as acts of
memory, resistance,
and justice. From the
arpilleristas
of Chile under Pinochet
(1973–1990) to the Mampuján weavers of Colombia following the
paramilitary incursion of 2000
in the Montés de María area of the
Chocó region in northern Colombia, expression using fabric and needlework
have become an extension of women’s bodies. Through this practice, they
have documented violence and asserted presence in histories
that sought to erase
The act of piercing soft
material with hard metal transforms into a mode of testimony, a way of stitching
together fragmented truths
and making injustice visible. As Christine Andrä
et al. (2020) discuss, these textile-making practices function as embodied
knowledge, tangible records of suffering, resilience, and resistance. Much like
arpilleristas
who embroidered resistance into fabric, the voices of
these women layer upon one another like the dyed patterns on batik cloth,
to be silenced. Their collective speech, their acts of remembrance and
defiance, ensure that neither their grief nor their demand
for justice will
fade. While the TRRC provided a platform for their voices, the struggle for
recognition and reparations continues
beyond its hearings. In this space, these
women, like so many before them, stitch their truths into history, one word, one
one act of resilience at a time.
The TRRC marked a pivotal moment in The Gambia’s pursuit of justice
after 22 years of Yahya Jammeh’s dictatorship. Established
in 2018, the
TRRC investigated extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, and
sexual violence, documenting over 400
cases of enforced disappearances and 200
instances of torture (Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission [TRRC],
2021). While
it provided a platform for victims and survivors, the struggle for
accountability and reparations remains ongoing, with justice contingent
political will and sustained civil society advocacy. The TRRC functioned as a
mechanism for truth-telling, exposing state-sanctioned
violence and shaping
national memory. However, its lack of prosecutorial power, resistance from
political factions, and resource
constraints limited its ability to enforce
accountability. While public hearings and outreach efforts aimed to bridge
societal divides,
the implementation of institutional reforms, reparations, and
criminal accountability remains uncertain (TRRC, 2021). Civil society
organizations, including WAVE, played a crucial role in documenting abuses,
advocating for justice, and supporting victims through
community-led memory
initiatives (McEvoy & McGregor, 2008).
This article draws on ethnographic research at WAVE, examining how families
of the disappeared navigate mourning and justice. Engaging
with Jacques
Derrida’s concept of “archive fever” (1998), Paul
Ricœur’s narrative identity (1991), Michel
Foucault’s theories
on power and knowledge (1980), and Hannah Arendt’s reflections on
forgiveness and justice (1958),
this study explores how memory, storytelling,
and grassroots activism shape transitional justice in The Gambia. While the TRRC
a vital space for truth-seeking, its legacy depends on whether its
findings translate into meaningful reform. By situating the TRRC
within global
transitional justice debates (Millar, 2011; Sieder, 2001), this article
emphasizes the role of victim-led movements
and community-based initiatives in
sustaining justice beyond formal commissions. It highlights the challenges of
implementing truth
commission recommendations, underscoring the necessity of
ongoing civic engagement to ensure long-term accountability and reconciliation
(Burgess, 2006; Roht-Arriaza & Mariezcurrena, 2012).
Yahya Jammeh’s Regime and the Path to Transition
On the morning of July 22, 1994, a small group of armed soldiers, identified
as junior officers of the Gambian National Army, stormed
the State House and
overthrew the government. This coup marked the beginning of Yahya Jammeh’s
regime. At 29 years old, Jammeh,
then a lieutenant, declared himself head of
state, ushering in an era characterized by severe repression, authoritarian
governance,
and widespread fear (Dwyer, 2017; Kandeh, 2004; Wiseman, 1996). Over
the next two decades, Jammeh’s regime became notorious
for systemic human
rights abuses. Political opponents, journalists, and perceived dissenters were
frequently arrested, tortured,
and killed (Amnesty International, 2008; Freedom
House, 2015; Human Rights Watch, 2016). The National Intelligence Agency (NIA,
of Jammeh’s security apparatus), alongside paramilitary units like
the Junglers, carried out arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances,
extrajudicial killings, fostering a climate of terror (Davidheiser & Hultin,
2012; Saine, 2003). High-profile cases exemplified
the regime’s brutality,
including the 2004 assassination of journalist Deyda Hydara, a vocal critic of
Jammeh and co-founder
newspaper. Hydara was shot and killed
by unidentified gunmen, later linked to the Junglers, following years of threats
and intimidation
(Committee to Protect Journalists, 2005; Reporters Without
Borders, 2004; TRRC, 2021). Similarly, the arbitrary detention and torture
opposition leaders, such as United Democratic Party (UDP) leader Ousainou Darboe
and members of his party, demonstrated the regime’s
systematic repression
(Amnesty International, 2016). The pervasive culture of impunity and lack of
independent judicial oversight
allowed these abuses to continue unchecked
(Davidheiser & Hultin, 2012; Saine, 2003).
In December 2016, Jammeh lost the presidential election to Adama
Although he initially
conceded defeat, Jammeh later contested the results, citing irregularities and
refusing to step down, leading
to a significant political crisis (Hultin et al.,
2017; Kora & Darboe, 2017). The Economic Community of West African States
played a pivotal role in mediating the crisis. Leaders, including
Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari and Senegal’s
President Macky
Sall, engaged in intensive diplomatic efforts to persuade Jammeh to transfer
power peacefully. ECOWAS also imposed
economic sanctions, freezing assets and
restricting travel for Jammeh and his associates. As the situation escalated,
ECOWAS authorized
the deployment of a standby military force to intervene if
Jammeh did not comply with regional and international demands by the end
term in January 2017. International support from the African Union, United
Nations (UN), and various Western countries further
bolstered ECOWAS’s
efforts, supporting the deployment of regional troops as a last resort. On
January 21, 2017, Jammeh agreed
to relinquish power and went into exile in
Equatorial Guinea. The coordinated efforts of ECOWAS and international actors
were crucial
in averting a potential humanitarian crisis and upholding
democratic governance in The Gambia. The successful resolution of the political
standoff underscored the importance of regional cooperation and collective
action in addressing political challenges across Africa,
setting a precedent for
peaceful transitions of power and stability in the region.
The Establishment and Role of the TRRC in The Gambia
The TRRC was established in 2018 as part of The Gambia’s effort to
confront the legacy of Jammeh’s 22-year dictatorship.
Reconciliation and Reparations Commission Act (2017), passed in December 2017,
provided a framework for investigating
human rights abuses, giving victims a
platform to testify, and recommending reparative measures. Grounded in
international legal
frameworks, including the UN’s Set of Principles to
Combat Impunity (1997; see also Orentlicher, 2005) and the Office of the
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)’s guidelines on truth
commissions (2006), the TRRC emphasized the
right to truth as a cornerstone of
transitional justice (TRRC, 2021). Public hearings began on January 7, 2019, and
concluded on
May 28, 2021. A total of 392 witnesses testified about arbitrary
arrests, enforced disappearances, torture, and sexual violence (TRRC,
These testimonies formed a comprehensive historical record, reconstructing the
systemic repression under Jammeh’s rule.
The hearings were broadcast
publicly, ensuring transparency, while the TRRC’s investigative units
worked to verify testimonies,
cross-check evidence, and uncover new leads. The
TRRC preserved archival records, documents, and witness accounts, ensuring that
information about human rights violations remained accessible for future
research and legal proceedings (Truth, Reconciliation and
Reparations Commission
Act, 2017).
Beyond truth-telling, the TRRC prioritized reparations and reconciliation. A
reparations committee recommended financial compensation,
psychological support,
and community rehabilitation programs to help victims rebuild their lives.
However, the TRRC faced significant
challenges in evidence gathering, securing
participation, and ensuring the safety of witnesses, as many feared reprisals or
stigma. To address these issues, the TRRC implemented confidentiality
measures, provided psychological support, and worked closely
with civil society
organizations to encourage engagement (Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations
Commission Act, 2017; TRRC, 2020).
Grassroots engagement played a critical role
in the TRRC’s success. Civil society organizations, such as WAVE, the
Network against Extrajudicial Killings and Enforced Disappearances
(ANEKED), Women in Liberation and Leadership (WILL), and The Solo
Foundation, were instrumental in documenting abuses, advocating for justice, and
ensuring reconciliation efforts were community
driven. These organizations
ensured that victims’ voices remained central to the transitional justice
process, reinforcing
the role of civil society in shaping The Gambia’s
post-TRRC landscape. Traditional reconciliation methods were also integrated
into the TRRC’s outreach efforts, making the process more accessible and
culturally relevant.
(community gatherings), religious mediation,
and griot-led storytelling
platforms for public dialogue, conflict resolution, and intergenerational
knowledge-sharing (International Center for Transitional
Justice [ICTJ], 2022;
TRRC, 2021).
enabled community members to discuss grievances and
foster reconciliation in a familiar setting, while religious leaders played a
critical role in framing justice through Islamic and Christian principles of
forgiveness and accountability. Griots, as oral historians,
transmit the narratives of survivors and victims’ families, reinforcing
The Gambia’s tradition of
truth-telling through storytelling.
Yet, despite its achievements, the TRRC faced significant challenges that
exposed the limitations of its mandate and raised concerns
effectiveness of transitional justice in The Gambia. One of the primary concerns
was its lack of prosecutorial power. While
the TRRC could recommend
prosecutions, it lacked the authority to enforce them, raising doubts about
whether perpetrators of grave
human rights violations would ever face true
accountability. Additionally, despite the TRRC’s extensive investigations,
and time constraints left some cases inadequately addressed, creating
gaps in justice for many victims. Political and societal obstacles
complicated the TRRC’s work. The Gambian political landscape, marked by
lingering loyalties to Jammeh and deep divisions
over the transitional justice
process, created barriers to implementation. Some political factions and former
regime loyalists resisted
the TRRC’s findings, undermining its credibility
and blocking meaningful action on its recommendations. Moreover, societal
mistrust, a significant legacy of Jammeh’s rule, made it difficult to
foster genuine reconciliation and collective acknowledgment
of past atrocities.
Beyond these practical challenges, the TRRC’s approach has been critiqued
for its risk of depoliticizing
violence and failing to address structural
injustices. By focusing heavily on individual testimonies and specific cases,
at times overlooked the broader political, social, and economic
conditions that enabled systemic repression. This approach risked
reducing the
violence of the Jammeh era to personal wrongdoing, rather than confronting the
institutional complicity of state actors,
political elites, and international
partners. These challenges underscore the complexity of transitional justice
Upon concluding its investigations, the TRRC released a final report
detailing its findings and recommending legal and institutional
reforms aimed at
preventing future human rights violations and strengthening democratic
governance. However, the implementation of
these recommendations remains
uncertain, and their impact on long-term accountability and justice depends on
political will and sustained
civil society advocacy. While the TRRC provided a
vital space for truth-telling, its legacy will be determined by how effectively
its findings are translated into meaningful change. The TRRC laid the foundation
for a more just and inclusive society but ensuring
that justice and
reconciliation endure requires persistent engagement beyond its hearings and
final report. Addressing individual
culpability is essential, but so too is
tackling the broader political and social structures that enabled these
violations. Without
meaningful structural reform, transitional justice risks
becoming a symbolic exercise rather than a mechanism for lasting institutional
transformation.
Philosophical Underpinnings of Truth-Seeking in Transitional Justice:
Centering The Gambia
The philosophical foundations of truth-seeking in transitional justice are
enriched by the perspectives of Jacques Derrida, Paul Ricœur,
Foucault, and Hannah Arendt. Engaging with these philosophical frameworks is
crucial for understanding the complexities of
uncovering truth, addressing past
injustices, and fostering reconciliation. These thinkers provide essential
insights into truth,
memory, justice, and power, all of which are central to the
functioning of truth commissions. However, transitional justice is not
universal process; it is deeply embedded within historical, political, and
cultural contexts. The Gambia’s TRRC emerged from
post-dictatorship setting, shaped by colonial legacies, Indigenous knowledge
systems, and shifting political landscapes.
While Derrida, Ricœur,
Foucault, and Arendt offer valuable theoretical tools, their applicability must
be critically examined
in relation to The Gambia’s own intellectual
traditions and justice practices. To this end, local perspectives on truth and
justice, including the work of Gambian scholars and historians, provide
complementary insights that contextualize truth-seeking,
memory-making, and
justice in post-Jammeh Gambia. Yet, the scarcity of Gambian academic engagement
with transitional justice, due
in part to historically underdeveloped research
infrastructure and a limited focus on critical justice studies, raises questions
frameworks dominate transitional justice discourse,
and how they intersect with
local epistemologies and cultural practices, is essential for a more grounded
and inclusive approach.
Understanding the limited visibility of Gambian scholars
in global transitional justice debates, and how their perspectives can enrich
the field, is crucial to developing a more contextually relevant and
representative examination of truth-seeking in The Gambia.
Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricœur on Truth, Memory, and
Derrida’s philosophy, characterized by deconstruction, interrogates and
critiques the foundations of philosophical discourses.
Deconstruction reveals
inherent contradictions within conceptual structures, showing that these
contradictions are fundamental to
Western metaphysical thought. Derrida’s
assertion that “deconstruction is justice” encapsulates his view of
not as fixed principles but as an ongoing process that must question and
exceed established norms (1992, p. 14–15). This perspective
particularly relevant to The Gambia’s post-Jammeh context, where
uncovering state-sponsored atrocities demands continuous
re-evaluation of power
structures and dominant narratives. The TRRC’s role in breaking through
years of state-imposed silence
aligns with Derrida’s notion of justice as
an “always deferred” process (1994, p. 19). This is especially
in cases of enforced disappearances, where the truth remains
incomplete, and the spectres of past crimes continue to shape the present.
haunting of Jammeh-era violence, as experienced by families of the disappeared,
resonates with Derrida’s idea that past
atrocities persist in the present,
making justice an ongoing ethical responsibility rather than a fully realizable
state. This aporetic
dimension of justice, which remains inherently to come,
includes the radical possibility of reconfiguring the present into a more
order. Engaging with this understanding of justice requires keeping the future
open within the present, ensuring that justice
remains perfectible and never
fully settled. This responsibility entails the practice of deconstruction,
allowing theoretical activity
and democratic institutions to remain critical of
their foundations, mitigating their violences, and staying open to
transformation
(Derrida, 2005). In transitional justice, where truth commissions
often operate within rigid legal and institutional frameworks,
insights highlight the importance of questioning and re-evaluating mechanisms to
ensure they remain dynamic and responsive
to each unique historical and cultural
context (1994). Derrida also warns against power mechanisms that close off the
future by imposing
presence, particularly through technological and media
apparatuses that reduce time to a pseudo-substantial present. In
Echographies
of Television
(2002), Derrida reflects on how media retransmissions of
real-time events reduce their complexity and the suffering of victims to
sensationalism. In The Gambia, the TRRC’s widely broadcast hearings shaped
how trauma and testimony were consumed by the
public. While this created
unprecedented visibility, it also risked flattening victims’ experiences
into spectacles of suffering,
reinforcing Derrida’s concern that justice
mediated through technology requires critical engagement with how narratives are
framed and disseminated.
Paul Ricœur (1991) emphasizes the narrative dimension of memory and its
role in shaping historical truth. His concept of “narrative
identity” highlights how individuals and communities construct their
understanding of the past through storytelling. This is
essential in The Gambia,
where oral traditions have long played a central role in historical
preservation. The TRRC’s reliance
on survivor testimonies and public
retellings of atrocities mirrors Ricœur’s view that truth emerges
through the interplay
of personal and collective memory. However, this raises a
critical question: whose narratives were centered, and whose were marginalized,
in the TRRC’s official record? While Ricœur’s ideas on
historical memory align with truth commissions’ emphasis
on storytelling,
it is crucial to examine how Gambian oral traditions and Indigenous knowledge
systems complement or challenge his
framework. Scholars, such as Boubacar Barry
(1998) and Hassoum Ceesay (2016), have explored how colonial archives and state
have shaped Gambian history, emphasizing the need to interrogate
official memory production in transitional justice. The TRRC’s
report, while extensive, reflects a curated version of history that may not
fully capture the complexity of local memory practices.
Michel Foucault’s Perspective on Power and Truth
Michel Foucault’s analysis of power and truth offers crucial insights
into truth-seeking in transitional justice, particularly
in The Gambia’s
TRRC. He argues that truth is not an objective reality but is shaped by power
relations and discourses, influencing
what is heard, what is silenced, and how
historical narratives are constructed. Foucault’s concept of
“power/knowledge”
highlights how those in control determine what is
considered truth, shaping transitional justice processes (1980). At the TRRC,
underscores the importance of examining whose voices were privileged during
hearings and whether testimonies led to meaningful systemic
change, especially
amid political negotiations over prosecutions. The TRRC’s role in
validating marginalized voices and exposing
historical injustices must be
understood within this broader power dynamic: who defines truth and whose
suffering is acknowledged
or erased. Foucault’s concept of
“governmentality” further explains how societies govern themselves
through norms,
institutions, and practices (1991). In The Gambia, colonial and
post-colonial governance structures have long shaped legal and social
institutions, influencing how truth and justice are understood. Although the
TRRC presented itself as a neutral arbiter of historical
truth, it operated
within a broader network of power dynamics, from international donors shaping
funding priorities to political
constraints imposed by the state. This meant
that some narratives were inevitably emphasized over others, reinforcing
argument that truth commissions are shaped by the forces that
create and sustain them. To be effective, truth commissions must navigate
power dynamics to ensure inclusivity and fairness. Without critically assessing
how dominant narratives perpetuate injustice,
truth-seeking efforts risk further
marginalizing certain groups (Foucault, 1980). The TRRC faced this challenge
while various political
and institutional actors sought to control how past
injustices were framed, who was held responsible, and what forms of
accountability
would follow. A major challenge for the TRRC was disrupting
dominant narratives that perpetuate injustice. In post-colonial societies,
historical narratives have long been state-controlled, constructing an inclusive
historical truth remains contested. The TRRC
aimed to create space for
alternative voices, allowing survivors and marginalized communities to challenge
state-controlled histories.
However, this process was hindered by political
interference, resistance from entrenched power structures, and difficulties in
implementing
its recommendations. Applying Foucault’s insights to The
Gambia’s TRRC highlights how transitional justice is deeply
embedded in
power structures and requires continuous scrutiny. While the TRRC sought to
amplify marginalized voices, its long-term
impact depends on whether its
findings lead to genuine reform or remain co-opted by the same political
structures it sought to dismantle.
Hannah Arendt’s Conception of the Political in Transitional
Hannah Arendt’s conception of the political offers a compelling lens
for understanding the TRRC’s role in The Gambia’s
transitional
justice process. Arendt views politics as an active space where individuals
engage in public discourse, shaping collective
memory and defining justice and
reconciliation (1958). Truth commissions serve as arenas where survivors,
perpetrators, and the broader
public confront past injustices and reconstruct
historical narratives. The TRRC exemplified this by making public testimony
allowing Gambians to engage in a national dialogue about human rights
violations under Jammeh. For Arendt, public space is defined
by speech and
action, and justice is possible only when individuals step forward to articulate
experiences and challenge dominant
narratives. The TRRC, through its hearings,
created such a space, enabling victims to voice suffering, perpetrators to
confess, and
the nation to collectively reckon with its past. However, as Arendt
notes, action is unpredictable and irreversible, meaning truth
commissions
cannot fully control how narratives are received. The TRRC’s truth-telling
process was shaped by political contestation,
as different factions framed its
findings to suit their interests. Some viewed it as a step toward healing, while
others saw it as
political maneuvering, reinforcing Arendt’s argument that
politics is always subject to competing interpretations. Arendt also
the importance of promises in mitigating political uncertainty. Truth
commissions often come with state commitments to
institutional reform,
reparations, and guarantees of non-recurrence, but, as Arendt warns, promises
are fragile. The TRRC recommended
prosecutions, reparations, and security sector
reforms, yet implementation has been slow and uneven. This raises a critical
what happens when transitional justice promises remain unfulfilled?
The Gambia’s experience reflects the challenge of ensuring
political will
extends beyond truth-seeking. Irreversibility, another key Arendtian concept, is
mitigated by forgiveness. While she
does not advocate unconditional amnesty,
Arendt sees forgiveness as essential in breaking cycles of vengeance and
enabling political
renewal. The TRRC’s emphasis on reconciliation,
particularly through religious and community-based mechanisms, aligns with
perspective. Many perpetrators publicly apologized during hearings, seeking
forgiveness, but not all victims were willing or
able to forgive. Arendt’s
framework suggests that reconciliation cannot be imposed: it must emerge through
public engagement
and mutual recognition. New beginnings are central to
Arendt’s vision of political life. She argues that political rupture
creates opportunities for renewal, but realizing this potential depends on human
action. The TRRC sought to lay the foundation for
a new Gambia by fostering
dialogue and accountability, yet its success is not guaranteed. Persistent
political instability and resistance
to accountability suggest that the TRRC
alone cannot transform society. Arendt’s perspective helps us understand
that transitional
justice is an ongoing process requiring sustained civic
engagement. While the TRRC created a moment of collective reckoning, its
long-term impact will depend on whether Gambians build on this foundation for a
more just and democratic society. Arendt’s
insights reinforce that
transitional justice is not simply about legal or institutional outcomes but
justice is actively pursued through speech, action,
and political engagement. Without structural change, truth-telling alone is
insufficient.
The TRRC opened the door to a new political reality in The Gambia,
but whether it leads to transformation will depend on how Gambians
navigate the
interplay of justice, power, and political will in the years to come.
Expanding the Theoretical Scope of Transitional Justice in The
While Derrida, Ricœur, Foucault, and Arendt provide valuable
philosophical insights into truth-seeking, memory, and justice,
an over-reliance
on Western theoretical frameworks risks marginalizing Gambian intellectual
traditions and Indigenous reconciliation
practices. Scholars, such as Lamin
Sanneh (1997), Ceesay (2016), and Barry (1998), have written extensively on
historical memory,
oral traditions, and colonial legacies in The Gambia, yet
their work remains underutilized in global transitional justice debates.
Sanneh’s 1997 work on Islam and Indigenous African religious traditions
provides critical insights into how Gambian society
has historically navigated
justice and reconciliation through local spiritual and communal frameworks. His
scholarship underscores
the role of religious institutions in shaping historical
memory and social cohesion, which is crucial for understanding how the
engagement with religious leaders impacted national healing
processes. Ceesay’s research on Gambian history and oral traditions
highlights the importance of griots in preserving collective memory and shaping
historical narratives (2016). His work provides a
framework for analyzing how
testimony, whether before the TRRC or within informal community spaces,
functions as a means of resistance
and justice-seeking. By integrating his
scholarship, transitional justice discourse in The Gambia can more effectively
examine how
oral histories challenge dominant state-controlled narratives and
contribute to a more inclusive record of past atrocities. Barry’s
scholarship on colonial and post-colonial power structures in West Africa
contextualizes how legacies of European rule continue to
shape governance and
legal institutions in The Gambia (1998). His work is essential for understanding
the colonial origins of legal
systems and their impact on contemporary justice
mechanisms, shedding light on the structural barriers to achieving true
post-authoritarian
accountability. Future research should seek to bridge the gap
between Western theory and Gambian knowledge systems, ensuring that
Gambia’s transitional justice discourse reflects both global insights and
local epistemologies. By critically engaging
with both Western and African
knowledge traditions, transitional justice mechanisms in The Gambia can evolve
beyond rigid institutional
models and embrace a more holistic, culturally
relevant approach to justice, truth-seeking, and reconciliation. This requires
dominant frameworks and foregrounding Gambian intellectual
contributions in transitional justice scholarship, ensuring that the voices
shaping the nation’s historical memory are not just those of international
experts, but also of Gambians themselves.
Enduring Grief and the Unfinished Struggle for Justice
The TRRC achieved notable accomplishments in uncovering human rights
violations that occurred during Jammeh’s regime. Through
rigorous public
hearings involving testimonies from over 1,000 witnesses, the TRRC shed light on
numerous cases of torture, extrajudicial
killings, enforced disappearances, and
sexual violence. These testimonies provided a comprehensive account of the
abuses and helped
identify perpetrators and the systemic nature of the
violations. The TRRC’s efforts in documenting these testimonies created
invaluable historical record, crucial for both national and international
understanding of Jammeh’s human rights abuses.
One poignant example is the
case of Alhaji Mamut Ceesay, whose mother, Ya Mamie Ceesay, has been a vocal
advocate for justice. Ya
Mamie, the Chairwoman of WAVE, lost her son to the
Junglers, who confessed to killing him and one of his friends in front of the
TRRC. Her advocacy and testimony highlighted the emotional and psychological
toll on families who still seek closure. During a gathering
at WAVE, Ya Mamie
articulated the pain of not knowing the final resting place of loved ones and
the government’s responsibility
in providing answers:
Salaam alaikum. I am greeting everyone who is here. We know that this is a
difficult gathering. Every time you talk about it, it comes
back ... . There
will be no forgetting. There is no possibility for forgetting, but we live with
it. We pretend it is not happening,
put it in the back of your mind. We all know
that we’ll die, but God who created us, created death. He laid something
for us, that when a person dies, this is how we should act: we wash him,
bury him, we know that this is where his grave is. His family,
they will know he
is laid here, he died, but this is where he is. That, too, is very important.
So, if your person died and you don’t
know where they are, it is something
that is truly heartbreaking. Like I said, we know we will all die, but God who
created us knows
that death is not pleasant. That’s why He decided that
whoever dies needs to be buried; a grave is important. Today, when I
can say my father’s grave is over there, I am going to visit him. My
mother’s grave is over there. My child’s
grave is over there. But
your son died, they said he died. You know they said that’s what you say.
What makes it clear that
he’s dead is seeing the body lying there. But we
don’t have that. So, what I say is, to keep it short, it is the
government’s
responsibility to, you know, they inherited Yahya
Jammeh’s Government. Each person that inherits something, you have to show
your stance. It seems like it’s the sitting Government’s
responsibility to do it, but they didn’t do it. It’s
something that
they know is on them. But what I say is, I know myself! But I believe that
anybody who has somebody who died but you
don’t see their body.
What’s in my heart is something that is in your heart. The Government
should stand up. When they
don’t have the strength, they go to other
countries. The way they beg for money to take care of their own needs. They
know that people who die are also citizens of this country and it’s
their responsibility to take action until they see where
those people are
buried. Understand, what I cannot accept is, the Jungler stands there saying,
‘I killed so-and-so. Where did
you bury him/her?’ And you say,
‘I don’t know.’ That is hiding something. For me, they are
hiding something.
The government is helping them in that hiding, is helping
them. If they come and say they killed him/her, you would say, where did
him? Me, I was picked. I forced myself to go to Kanilai on my own. Three times.
We went there. We went, they said: we think
it’s here; we think it’s
here, we think it’s here. Since we left there until now, I have not sat
with any official
of the government for them to tell me which steps we will
take. We went anyway to dig, we didn’t see anything here, we didn’t
see anything there, we didn’t see anything there. We left it there and
that’s it. It’s not going to be easy in
that manner. It’s not
going to be easy. And until they have done so, the responsibility will still be
on them whether they
know it or not. I personally think that they know, they do
it on purpose. (Ya Mamie Ceesay, personal communication, 2023)
Ya Mamie Ceesay’s speech captures in great depth the enduring pain and
frustration experienced by the families of the disappeared
in The Gambia. Her
words offer a powerful lens through which to analyze the complexities of
justice, memory, and power in the context
of transitional justice, drawing on
the theories of Derrida, Ricœur, Foucault, and Arendt. For Derrida, justice
is always deferred
and never fully attainable (1992). This resonates strongly
with the persistent uncertainty in Ya Mamie’s plea for government
and accountability. The absence of her son’s body and the lack of clear
answers from the authorities illustrate Derrida’s
idea of justice being
forever out of reach. This state of uncertainty also aligns with Gabriel
Gatti’s notion of “living
deaths,” where disappearance is not
just the loss of a person but the creation of a liminal existence—neither
nor alive but suspended in absence (2022). In his 2022 work, Gatti
explores how the families of the disappeared are forced to navigate
unresolved grief, in which they remain trapped between mourning and waiting,
remembering and forgetting. This perpetual
state of ambiguity reinforces
Derrida’s concept of hauntology, in which the disappeared continue to
exist as specters in the
present, shaping both memory and demands for justice.
In The Gambia, where enforced disappearances under Jammeh’s regime left
families searching for decades, this suspended state of mourning complicates
both personal healing and national reconciliation. Ya
Mamie’s continuous
demand for the truth and her distrust of the government’s intentions
underscores the aporetic nature
of justice, where closure remains elusive and
the quest for truth is an unending endeavor. Ricœur’s concept of
identity (1991) emphasizes the importance of testimonies in shaping
collective memory and identity. Ya Mamie’s recounting of
disappearance and the authorities' inaction contribute to a collective narrative
of suffering and resilience. This
narrative identity is essential in
constructing a shared history, fostering a sense of solidarity among the
victims, and influencing
broader societal memory. Her story becomes part of the
collective identity, reminding society of the past while shaping future
understandings
and actions. In analyzing the dynamics of truth-seeking,
Foucault’s ideas on power and truth are particularly relevant. Foucault
argues that truth is produced through power relations and discourses. Ya
Mamie’s speech highlights the power dynamics at play,
where the government
and the Junglers control the narrative and information about the disappearances.
Foucault’s “power/knowledge”
theory (1980) encapsulates how
those in power can control the production and dissemination of knowledge. Ya
Mamie’s call for
transparency and accountability challenges these power
structures, seeking to democratize the truth-seeking process and validate
experiences of the victims. By demanding answers and questioning the
authorities, she disrupts established power dynamics and
insists on a more
inclusive and truthful account of events. Arendt’s interpretation of the
political (1958) underscores the
importance of public space and dialogue in
achieving justice and reconciliation. Ya Mamie’s speech, delivered in a
setting, embodies Arendt’s idea of the public realm as a space
for collective action and discourse. Her emphasis on the government’s
responsibility and the need for accountability highlights Arendt’s
position on the banality of evil, where ordinary people
can become complicit in
atrocities through passivity or adherence to orders (1963). The exclusion of
victims from the process and
the government’s inaction reflects broader
societal tendencies to ignore or sideline those who suffer, a critical issue
that Arendt examines in her work. By turning her private grief into public
political action, Ya Mamie reinforces the importance
of visibility and
collective memory in the healing process. In her speech, Ya Mamie articulates
the deep emotional pain of not knowing
her son’s final resting place,
underscoring the human need for closure and the societal duty to provide it. Her
narrative highlights
the failings of the state and the continuing struggle for
justice, resonating with the theoretical frameworks of Derrida, Ricœur,
Foucault, and Arendt. Each perspective illuminates different facets of Ya
Mamie’s struggle, from the perpetual quest for justice
and the shaping of
collective memory to the dynamics of power and the significance of public
dialogue. Together, they offer a comprehensive
understanding of the challenges
and the ongoing journey toward truth and reconciliation in The Gambia.
Broader Implications for Transitional Justice
The TRRC’s experience offers valuable insights for transitional justice
processes worldwide, particularly in relation to grassroots
engagement and
localized approaches to truth-seeking. Comparative analysis reveals that
successful truth commissions share common
features, including robust civil
society participation, public testimony, and integration of traditional justice
mechanisms (Kelsall,
2005; Laplante & Theidon, 2007; Millar, 2011; Ross,
2003; Shaw, 2007; Sieder, 2001; Wilson, 2001; Yezer, 2008). While the TRRC
shared goals with other commissions, such as South Africa’s Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and Argentina’s
National Commission on the
Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP), it also faced unique challenges. South
Africa’s TRC focused
on public hearings and an amnesty process, while
CONADEP in Argentina prioritized forensic documentation of disappearances. The
TRRC had to navigate a more expansive transitional justice mandate,
addressing not only enforced disappearances and killings but
also widespread
sexual violence and economic crimes. The TRRC’s reliance on grassroots
memory projects and civil society activism
provided a more inclusive model of
truth-seeking, ensuring that reconciliation efforts extended beyond state-led
mechanisms. This
engagement underscores the importance of integrating local
traditions and participatory justice initiatives into transitional justice
processes. Insights from The Gambia’s TRRC highlight the necessity of
bottom-up approaches in fostering sustainable peace.
The active role of civil
society, grassroots organizations, and memory initiatives ensured that
transitional justice was deeply embedded
within Gambian communities rather than
dictated solely by the state. Comparisons with other truth commissions reveal
that effective
transitional justice requires adaptability, balancing
institutional mechanisms with community-led processes to ensure long-term impact
(Burgess, 2006; Clark, 2010). By learning from the TRRC’s experience,
future research and policy development in transitional
justice can better
incorporate community participation, address the socio-economic dimensions of
justice, and build more inclusive
memory practices. The TRRC’s legacy
ultimately underscores that true reconciliation and accountability require more
than institutional
reforms; they demand sustained civic engagement, continuous
reflection, and a commitment to ensuring that the voices of victims remain
central to justice efforts.
I am back in The Gambia, sitting in the same room at WAVE where, two years
ago, I gathered with women who had lost husbands, sons,
brothers, and fathers to
enforced disappearance. The air is thick with heat, the ceiling fan above me
whirring at its steady pace,
now just as it did then. However, on this occasion
I am alone, rewriting the conclusion to this article, tracing the echoes of that
conversation, their words still present in the stillness of the room. The heat
presses in, the fan’s hum a quiet reminder of
time passing. The voices of
those women, layered with pain and resilience, still resonate, much like the
testimonies recorded by
the TRRC. Fragmented yet forming a whole, each story is
interwoven into the fabric of national memory. The gathering at WAVE, like
TRRC hearings, was more than a space for recollection: it was a reckoning. The
past refuses to remain buried, its weight pressing
forward, demanding
recognition, justice, and redress. But, as Halima asked, what comes next? The
TRRC may have concluded its hearings,
but the struggle does not end with its
final report. Truth-telling is not an endpoint but part of an ongoing process,
where justice
remains deferred, elusive, and contingent upon political will and
sustained civic engagement. The TRRC exposed the depths of state-sanctioned
violence, created a historical record, and provided a platform for victims to
speak, but truth alone does not ensure justice. The
gap between acknowledgment
and action, between memory and meaningful reform, remains wide.
The Gambia’s transitional justice process underscores both the
possibilities and limits of state-led initiatives. The TRRC was
a significant
step toward accountability, yet its impact will ultimately be determined by the
implementation of its recommendations
and the ability of civil society,
victim-led movements, and grassroots activists to sustain momentum.
Organizations that have long
been at the forefront of advocacy and truth-seeking
continue to push for justice, ensuring that the TRRC’s legacy is not
amid political inertia. Transitional justice does not reside solely
in legal frameworks and commissions; it is embedded in everyday
resistance, in
the work of those who refuse to let injustice be forgotten. Their efforts embody
what Ricœur calls narrative
identity, where memory becomes the foundation
of a people’s sense of self and moral agency. As I listen to the echoes of
conversation, I am again reminded of Sethe’s moment in
, where the weight of history breaks open,
carried on a wave of collective power. Here, too, voices rise, refusing silence,
erasure. In their testimonies, in their acts of remembrance and
defiance, they stitch themselves into history, ensuring that neither
their grief
nor their demand for justice will fade. While the TRRC provided an institutional
framework for truth-seeking, it is within
these spaces—within communities,
within the gathering of women, within the narratives passed from survivor to
survivor—that
the real work of reconciliation endures. The lessons from
The Gambia’s TRRC extend beyond its borders, offering insights into
necessity of victim-centered justice, the power of memory activism, and the role
of grassroots movements in ensuring that transitional
justice remains dynamic
and transformative. What comes next is uncertain, but one thing remains clear:
as long as voices continue
to rise, as long as stories continue to be told, the
struggle for truth and justice will persist, unfinished but unrelenting.

Chile used hand-sewn quilts (
) to document enforced
disappearances and state violence under Pinochet’s dictatorship. These
quilts, often made from discarded
fabric, served as both a form of protest and a
means of truth-telling, smuggled abroad to raise awareness of repression.
the Mampuján weavers in Colombia, survivors of a 2000
paramilitary massacre, created tapestries depicting displacement and
resilience,
later integrated into Colombia’s transitional justice processes. In both
cases, textile-making transformed personal
grief into political testimony,
ensuring women’s voices were embedded in historical memory (Andrä et
al., 2020; Bacic,
2015; Cole & House, 2020).
While The Gambia held regular
elections under Yahya Jammeh’s rule (1996, 2001, 2006, and 2011), these
elections were widely
criticized for lacking fairness and transparency. Jammeh
controlled key state institutions, including the Independent Electoral
(IEC), and frequently used intimidation tactics, arrests, and media
suppression to weaken the opposition. The African Union (AU),
Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS), and various international observers repeatedly
condemned electoral irregularities,
including the exclusion of opposition
candidates, voter suppression, and state-sponsored violence (Human Rights Watch,
2016; Perfect,
2017; Saine, 2009).
