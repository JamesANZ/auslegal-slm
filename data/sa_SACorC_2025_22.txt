INQUEST INTO THE DEATH OF
[2025] SACC 22
Introduction and reason for inquest
Carol Andrysik was 80 years of age when she died on 5 October 2022. She
sustained a fall 11 days prior to her death, which resulted
in a fractured left
neck of femur.
Andrysik was diagnosed with dementia in early 2020. As a result, she developed
a degree of confusion and engaged in behaviours
that placed her safety in
jeopardy, such as placing candles in the combustion fire and leaving the stove
on after cooking. After
careful consideration, a decision was made to
transition Mrs Andrysik into a residential aged care facility.
Andrysik required accommodation within the memory support unit of the facility,
which is a secure unit providing specialist care
to persons living with
An application was made
to the South Australian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (SACAT) for special
powers to authorise her detention
at her place of residence pursuant to
Guardianship and Administration Act
. This order was necessary to
lawfully accommodate Mrs Andrysik within the memory support unit as this
involved environmentally restraining
her in a manner that prevented her free

time of her death.

memory support unit into a quieter room within the facility,

not detained at the time of her death. However, death in custody is defined in
Coroners Act 2003
death in custody
means the death of a
person where there is reason to believe that the death occurred, or the cause of
death, or a possible cause
of death, arose, or may have arisen, while the person

fractured her left neck of femur, which was later confirmed
radiologically. The
fall occurred during her detention within the memory support unit.
will be detailed later in these findings, I am satisfied that the cause of Mrs
Andrysik’s death was a fractured left neck
of femur on a background of
rectal carcinoma and dementia.
Accordingly,
I find that Mrs Andrysik’s cause of death arose while she was detained
pursuant to
Guardianship and Administration Act
and that her
death constitutes a death in custody pursuant to
Coroners Act
An inquest into the cause and circumstances of her death is
therefore mandatory.
These are the
findings of that Inquest.
Andrysik was born in Hastings, England on 23 December
When she was about 14 years
old she migrated to Australia with her parents and five siblings. She left high
school to commence
work as a telephonist at the telephone exchange.
Andrysik married in April 1963 and had three daughters with her first husband.
She was employed as a receptionist at a medical
practice and as a duty officer
at Minda Incorporated.
enjoyed gardening, geology, music, reading and travel. She was a member of her
local tennis club and enjoyed dancing. While
travelling in Egypt, she met the
man who would later become her second husband, Paul Andrysik. Following their
marriage in 1988,
the couple lived in Melbourne where they worked together in
the bakery Mr Andrysik owned. They returned to Adelaide in 2010.
May 2018, Paul Andrysik passed away following a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
Mrs Andrysik was deeply affected by his death
and experienced significant grief.
early 2020, Mrs Andrysik underwent a brain scan which demonstrated changes
consistent with mixed dementia, predominantly
Alzheimer’s.
Her physical
and cognitive health declined in the latter half of that year, and in August
2020 a rectal examination led to a likely
She conveyed to her
family that she was grateful for the cancer, viewing it as a means to be with
her late husband.
Andrysik declined further investigation or treatment and accordingly the mass
was not definitely diagnosed as carcinoma.
Andrysik received strong support from her daughters who provided care to her
within the home until it was no longer feasible to
do so and Mrs Andrysik was
placed into high level residential care in Myrtle Bank. However, she was
removed from this facility by
her family as she did not appear to cope well with
the environment. An assessment conducted by the Southern Adelaide Aged Care
Team on 24 August 2020 noted that her daughters were committed to
providing their mother with home-based care and were strong advocates
despite their work and family
commitments.
1 February 2021, Mrs Andrysik moved into Cottage Grove, a residential aged care
facility managed by Eldercare in Woodcroft, South
Australia. She later
transitioned into the secure memory support unit due to concerns that she may
fall and/or leave the facility
Mrs Andrysik’s placement at Cottage Grove
Andrysik was observed to be very happy at Cottage Grove. One of her three
daughters provided an affidavit
in which she stated that for the majority of the time she was happy with the
care provided to her mother, and described some of the
‘absolutely fabulous’. She did, however, raise concerns with the
facility regarding their staffing levels.
She also described occasions when she
needed to advocate for her mother to receive appropriate pain
concerns regarding pain management were conveyed to Dr Brooke-Davey,
Mrs Andrysik’s general practitioner. Dr Brooke-Davey
stated that she
took immediate action in response and increased the dose of Mrs Andrysik’s
Norspan patch.
Andrysik’s health continued to decline in a manner consistent with her
diagnoses, and she experienced several occasions
of tachycardia. Her tumour
