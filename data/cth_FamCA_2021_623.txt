SUMMARY FOR PUBLICATION
1 This Summary does not form part of the Reasons for
Judgment delivered on 25 August, 2021. The Reasons for Judgment are contained
a separate Confidential Annexure, access to which is limited in accordance with
the orders of the Court. The summary is provided
in the interests of balancing
the need for open justice and the need to uphold the claim to public interest
immunity made by the
NSW Crime Commission. The Commission seeks an order that no
other parties have access to an unredacted copy of Dr DD dated 9 December
The Court is satisfied the evidence demonstrates that there is a need to protect
methodologies and procedures of the Commission.
This need must be balanced
against the dictates of advancing the administration of justice by allowing the
mother and the Independent
Children Lawyer unfettered access to the suppressed
section of the report. However, the Court is also satisfied denying unfettered
access to that section is consistent with the best interests of the children the
subject of the proceedings. There is also a public
interest in advancing the
administration of justice by the Court giving weight to the statutory
requirement to uphold the best interests
of the children as the paramount
consideration in parenting proceedings.
2 After carrying out the necessary balancing process in resolving the
competition among the competing aspects of public interest,
the best interests
of the children and the protection of the methodologies and procedures of the
Commission outweighed the advancement
of the administration of justice by giving
access to the mother. Consequently, leave to inspect the unredacted version of
of Dr DD dated 9 December 2018 has been generally refused.
3 The Court has taken the further step of restricting access to or
publication of the confidential Reasons for Judgment because unrestricted
or publication could have the effect of defeating the Commission’s claim
of public interest immunity which is otherwise
4 There is a further question of access to the confidential Reasons for
Judgment. The Court is satisfied that the mother’s legal
representatives
and the independent children’s lawyer should be permitted access the
Reasons for Judgment for reasons of procedural
fairness, but subject to
non-publication and non-disclosure orders. The purpose of such orders is to
avoid defeat of the claim to
public interest immunity which the Reasons for
Judgment otherwise uphold
