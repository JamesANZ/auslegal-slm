Interest On Refunds Of Licence
Revenue Ruling BF.002
Section 19 of the
Business Franchise (Tobacco) Act
requires the Commissioner to repay amounts
of overpaid licence fees, subject to certain
restrictions, in respect of both tobacco and
petroleum products franchises.
In certain cases interest on such refunds may be
payable by the Commissioner under the
(Interest on Overpayments) Act 1986.
This ruling outlines the circumstances in which
interest may be paid on refunds of licence fees.
In accordance with the
Taxation (Interest on
Overpayments) Act 1986
, interest on refunds of
licence fees will be paid only where the
overpayment giving rise to the refund was as the
result of the following.
• A decision of the Commissioner upon an
objection, or
• A decision of the Tribunal; or
• A decision of a court in relation to:
- an objection; or
- a decision of the Tribunal.
Upon the success of such an appeal or objection,
interest will be paid on refunds of licence fees at the
rate set by the Governor-in-Council (10.085 per cent
per annum as at 1 April 1993).
Please note that rulings do not have the force of law.
Each decision made by the State Revenue Office is
made on the merits of each individual case having
regard to any relevant ruling. All rulings must be read
subject to Revenue Ruling GEN.01.
