REASONS FOR DECISION
Application
matter was heard at Grafton on 3
December 2013 when brief oral
reasons were given. These written reasons are given at the request of the
respondent. Mr Thompson appeared
for the applicants and the respondent appeared
on her own behalf.
applicants each gave evidence and relied upon documents that had been provided
to the Tribunal and the respondent pursuant to
directions made by the Tribunal
for the exchange of documents that were admitted into evidence.
respondent gave evidence and relied upon some medical reports that had
previously been provided to the Tribunal and also on a
statutory declaration of
Joanne Mills which were admitted into evidence.
the course of giving her evidence after the applicants had given evidence the
respondent sought an adjournment referring to
which the Tribunal took
to be a reference to
Legal Aid Commission Act 1979
respondent having previously informed the Tribunal that she had applied for
legal aid, was refused and had appealed against that
refusal. The Tribunal
refused that application as the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appeal was
bona fide the respondent having
been informed on 19
November 2013
when the matter was before the Tribunal for a return of summons that any such
application had to be supported by proper
evidence and the respondent did not
produce any supporting evidence. She claimed to be disadvantaged and unable to
defend herself.
The Tribunal was not persuaded that this was so having regard to
her conduct of the proceedings.
evidence on behalf of the applicants was that there was a residential tenancy
agreement between the parties in respect of premises
at Brooms Head on the New
South Wales which called for rent to be paid at the rate of $165.00 per week
having initially been $150.00
per week. Mr Elvery gave evidence that he served a
notice of termination by leaving it in an envelope addressed to the tenant on
the doorstep of the premises just inside the screen door on 8 September, there
being no letter box to leave it in and the respondent
not being at home at the
time. That notice was also posted the following day. That notice gave the
respondent until 22 September
2013 to leave the premises. The notice gave
non-payment of rent as the ground and contained the notice required by
Residential Tenancies Act 2010
Mrs Elvery gave evidence
that the respondent was substantially more than 14 days in arrears of rent at
the time the notice was served.
Her evidence was that as at the date of hearing
the respondent was in arrears to the extent of $6,765.00 which was supported by
records provided. No rent had been paid since 24 April
respondent gave evidence. She claimed that she never received the notice of
termination left on her doorstep and only received
it in the mail. She relied
upon the statutory declaration of M/s Mills that she did not witness the notice
of termination being left
on her doorstep as Mr Elvery claimed she had
witnessed. Mr Elvery’s explanation for this was that he had sought the
of M/s Mills who ran the local post office as to how to serve the notice
who advised him to serve it in the manner he did which was
what he meant to
convey by saying she was a witness. M/s Johnston said she couldn’t be sure
how much rent was owing, she was
very evasive and reluctant to answer questions
as to whether any rent had been paid since April. She claimed she was
disadvantaged
and unable to defend herself.
Tribunal accepted the evidence of Mr and Mrs Elvery as to the circumstance
surrounding the service of the notice of termination
and the amount of rent
owing at that time and at the date of the hearing. The method of service of the
notice of termination by leaving
it on the doorstep is not one of the methods
permitted under the
Residential Tenancies Act 2010
. Postal service is permitted
but allowing for 4 business days until the date of receipt means that
14 days notice was
not given. However the Tribunal found that the respondent
probably received the Notice of Termination on 8 September or very shortly
thereafter. The Tribunal found pursuant to
section 113
Residential
Tenancies Act 2010
that it was appropriate to make a termination order in view
of the extensive rent arrears and the fact that no rent had been paid
April 2013. The Tribunal further found that there was no prejudice to the
respondent in that she probably received the notice
September or
shortly thereafter and the notice gave the notice required by
section 88(3)
Residential Tenancies Act 2010
Tribunal was satisfied on the basis of the applicants’ evidence that there
had been a frequent failure to pay rent within
the meaning of
section 89(5)
Residential Tenancies Act 2010
Tribunal then considered the circumstances required to be taken into account by
section 87(6)
Residential Tenancies Act 2010
. Whilst the tenant clearly
has significant health issues for which she is entitled to considerable sympathy
the nature of the breach
is very serious and there have been no steps taken by
the respondent to remedy the breach. The fact that the respondent has other
proceedings on foot in the Tribunal relating to the condition of the premises
does not entitle her to refuse to pay rent. The Tribunal
accordingly made the
orders set out above.
