Bulun Bulun and Milpurrurru v R & T
Bulun Bulun and Milpurrurru v R & T Textiles
Federal Court of Australia
No. DG3 of 1996
Casenote by Martin Hardie
John Bulun Bulun and George Milpurrurru, the senior members of the Ganalbingu
people of North Central Arnhem Land, are in the Federal
Court attempting once
again to further push the boundaries of Australian intellectual property law
Bulun Bulun v Nejlam Pty Ltd
, unreported (settled), Federal Court
action in Northern Territory in 1989).
Bulun Bulun was the central applicant in Federal Court proceedings commenced
in 1988, a case which was the catalyst for the recent
Government focus in the
interface between the Aboriginal arts and intellectual property law.
Milpurrurru was the first named applicant in
Milpurrurru and Others v
Indofurn Pty Ltd and Others
(the 'Carpets Case'), decided in 1994 by Justice
Von Doussa (0994)
[1994] FCA 975
54 FCR 240).
That case saw traditional Aboriginal custom and
law being taken into account in the assessment of damages.
Prior to Bulun Bulun's first case, the accepted wisdom was that works of
Aboriginal art could not attract the protection of the
(Cth). That point was not decided then, but in
Yumbulul v Reserve Bank of
[1991] FCA 332
21 IPR 481)
French J decided Aboriginal artworks are
original; they therefore attract copyright protection, even though the work may
from a pre-existing tradition.
The recent proceedings commenced by Bulun Bulun and Milpurrurru seek to take
the law to a position where it is consistent with Aboriginal
tradition, custom
and law. During 1997 the respondents in the new proceedings, R & T Textiles
Pty Ltd, consented to having judgment
entered against them for breach of Bulun
Bulun's copyright. The matter will now proceed to trial on two issues never
before decided
by a court. These are:
1. Whether the other traditional Aboriginal owners of the corpus of ritual
knowledge from which the artistic work is derived are
the equitable owners of
the copyright subsisting in the artistic work; and
2. Whether an infringement of either the legal or equitable title to copyright
in a case such as this constitutes a nuisance which
has interfered with the
applicants' traditional Aboriginal ownership or native title rights in
Ganalbingu country.
It is expected that the case will be heard in the Federal Court in Darwin
before Von Doussa J in May of this year.
To some people the claims made by Milpurrurru in a representative capacity
may seem novel. Milpurrurru, as the second applicant in
the case, represents the
traditional Aboriginal owners of Ganalbingu country. These are described in the
application as including
the members of the Ganalbingu people, the Yolngu people
who are the children of the women of the Ganalbingu people, the Yolngu people
who stand in the relationship of mothers' mother to the members of the
Ganalbingu people under Ganalbingu law and custom, and such
other Yolngu people
who are recognised by the applicants according to Ganalbingu law and custom as
being traditional Aboriginal owners
of Ganalbingu country. The case seeks to
explore the nature and incidence of native title. The High Court has said, in
Mabo (No. 2) (Mabo v Queensland [No. 2]
[1992] HCA 23
(1992) 175 CLR 1)
nature and incidence of native title are to be determined by reference to the
traditions and customs of the Indigenous
people in question. To anybody who has
any knowledge of the system of Aboriginal art which exists in Arnhem Land, for
example, it
is clear that rights in paintings and rights in land are
inextricably woven. As Howard Morphy has said (see Ancestral Connection,
University Press, 1992) paintings are one manifestation of the ancestral world.
According to Yolngu law and custom, the ancestral
beings, the wangarr, handed
over the land to particular groups of people on the condition that those groups
continue to perform the
ceremonies, produce the paintings and the ceremonial
objects that commemorate the acts and journeys of the wangarr. Morphy has said
that Yolngu people guard their rights in paintings and the land equally, their
art allows the relationship to be encoded, and whether
the production is for
sale or ceremony, it is an assertion of the rights that are held in land.
Paragraph 8 of the amended statement of claim filed by Bulun Bulun and
Milpurrurru states that:-
'According to Ganalbingu custom and law, the first applicant's (Bulun Bulun)
creator ancestor caused Djilibinyamurr (the site in question)
to be formed and
settled the traditional Aboriginal ownership of that site upon the ancestors of
the first applicant to be held with
the other traditional. Aboriginal owners, on
the condition that they and their descendants perpetuate and maintain the
of the corpus of ritual knowledge (madayin) of the Ganalbingu people
associated with Ganalbingu country and in particular, Djilibinyamurr,
benefit of the Ganalbingu people, including, inter alia, the songs, dances and
paintings associated with Djilibinyamurr,
such being an obligation arising from
the granting to the applicants and their ancestors of traditional Aboriginal
ownership of Ganalbingu
The statement of claim then goes on to plead that Bulun Bulun's right to
paint and permit the reproduction of the artistic work is
subject to the
conditions set out in paragraph 8 and is an incident of his traditional
Aboriginal ownership of the land in question.
Works of art such as bark paintings have been recognised as a new form of
evidence, or as title deeds to land. Aboriginal Land Commissioners
Aboriginal Land Rights (NT) Act 1976
adopted aspects of Aboriginal art as relevant forms of evidence in ascertaining
whether or not certain Aboriginal people
are the traditional Aboriginal owners
of the land they claim. The case before the Federal Court at the present is an
attempt to bring
Australian intellectual property law into line with the
realities of Yolngu law.
