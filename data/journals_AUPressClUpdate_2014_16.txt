APC UPDATE | 29 August 2014
Summary of latest adjudication
Sharon Doyle/Bundaberg News Mail
The Press Council has considered a complaint about an article in the
Bundaberg News Mail on 23 April 2014 headed “Fatal car
crash a sad end to
Easter”, published in print, and “Cruel carving left on tree as
tragic crash is investigated”,
published online. The article concerned a
fatal collision between a car and tree.
The Council considered that the article, coming two days after the initial
report of the accident, gave more emphasis than necessary
to a police
officer’s speculation about possible causes of the accident, and could
have given more emphasis to the behaviour
of whoever carved offensive words on
the tree (which a witness described as "horrific").
The Council concluded that, despite the likely impact on the grieving family,
reporting the witness’s statement, the police
speculation and the words on
the tree was sufficiently justified in the public interest. Accordingly, while
saying the article might
have been written with more sympathy for the family,
the Council did not uphold the complaint.
However, the Council reiterated the need for great caution in cases of this
kind to avoid causing unnecessary distress or invasion
of privacy, particularly
in reporting speculation about the cause of an accident.

adjudication
A remedy without adjudication
A recent example of the Council helping complainants
obtain a remedy without adjudication
A complaint that articles about the complainant’s business were
unfairly and misleadingly based on the claims of a very few
disgruntled
customers and industry competitors, including the publisher.
Press Council staff contacted the publication about a number of changes to
the articles which had been suggested by the complainant.
The publication agreed
to some of them and also agreed to add to the online versions of each article a
disclosure that its parent
company offers services similar to those of the
complainant. The publication agreed that this would also be done in sister
publications
where the articles had appeared.
