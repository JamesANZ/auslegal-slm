ZAHARUIKO v PUBLIC TRUSTEE
[2025] SASCA 106
Court of Appeal: Civil – Livesey ACJ
Introduction
have called this matter over today because it has been referred back to the
Court of Appeal by a judge of the General Division.
The protected person, Mr
Edwardes, died on 11 or 12 July 2025. The issue is whether there remains any
utility in the proposed appeal,
or the part-heard interlocutory application,
seeking a raft of orders concerning the care and welfare of Mr Edwardes and
his Waterfall Gully home.
the purposes of this ruling, it is not necessary to address the various
contentions which have been made about who are the proper
parties to this
litigation.
The appeal proceedings and the interlocutory
applications
16 June 2025, the appellant filed a notice of appeal challenging
orders made by Hughes P on 9 May 2025, which included refusing
leave to proceed with an internal review and dismissing an application for
review. The decision was concerned with the review of
an order made by the
South Australian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (The
4 March 2025 approving the Public Trustee, as administrator for
Mr Edwardes, to sell Mr Edwardes’ house at Waterfall Gully
order to meet various debts, including debts owed to the care facility in which
Mr Edwardes had lived for the last few years.
Separately,
an urgent application was made to the Supreme Court seeking a stay or an order
restraining the Public Trustee from proceeding
with entry into a contract, or
from settling on any contract, for the sale and purchase of the Waterfall Gully
property. Justice
Gray heard and refused that
application.
is apparent from the materials that the sale has now
appeal to this Court requires permission to appeal because it concerns a
decision of the President of the Tribunal, Justice
the appeal was filed, the applicant made an application seeking urgent relief on
a broad range of matters. These included
that the administration and any orders
made by the Tribunal be stayed until further order, and that the affairs of the
person, Mr Edwardes, be vested in the Supreme Court pursuant to
the common law principles concerning
parens patriae
, and that the
protected person be brought before the Court pursuant to the common law
principles concerning
habeas corpus
B Doyle heard the application. The judge gave careful consideration to the
issues arising on it. He regarded the application
as falling into two
categories. The first concerned the Waterfall Gully property, and the second
raised broader issues about the
care of Mr Edwards and a number of
difficult legal questions concerning the extent of the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court in the
context of an appeal seeking relief and exercise of the
inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
the sale had completed, the judge refused to grant leave for what would
effectively amount to an interlocutory reversal of
the registration of the
indefeasible title obtained by the purchaser of the Waterfall Gully property
Real Property Act 1886
(SA). He recognised that it may follow
from his refusal to grant relief that the appeal proceeding was therefore
“moot or of
limited practical utility ... and accordingly that leave to
appeal should not be granted ... but that is not a question before
judge left for further consideration a number of “substantial
questions”, as follows:
(1) Is the relief sought relief of a kind that can be pursued on an
interlocutory application in an appellate proceeding;
(2) To the extent that the relief sought appeals to the Court’s inherent
parens patriae
habeas corpus
(a) does Mr Zaharuiko have standing to pursue the relief?
(b) what precisely are the grounds for the relief sought?
(c) should subpoenas be issued in aid of such a hearing as Mr Zaharuiko
(d) are there discretionary issues why the Court would refrain from embarking on
an inquiry into these matters given the existence
of, or availability of, other
proceedings in the Tribunal or under specific legislation?
that stage, the matter was adjourned to a hearing in mid-July. That hearing did
not proceed in any substantive way because the
protected person,
Mr Edwardes, died.
judge later made an order remitting the appeal and the interlocutory application
The utility of the appeal and the
interlocutory application
Ordinarily,
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under legislation such as the
Guardianship
and Administration Act 1993
(SA) is concerned with the care and welfare of
the protected person. On the death of the protected person, there is very
little left
for a guardian or administrator to
Zaharuiko accepted that, following the death of Mr Edwardes, it was obvious that
the matter could not continue and would need
to be discontinued. He says that
his offers to Public Trustee, which tied discontinuance to costs and various
conditions, were rejected.
He says that the Public Trustee unreasonably
rejected his proposals. Nonetheless, the parties agreed the quantum of costs at
the circumstances, it seems to me that there is now no utility in the appeal or
the interlocutory application. The Waterfall
Gully property has been sold and,
subject to meeting any obligations which may have accrued before the death of
Mr Edwardes, it will
be necessary for the Public Trustee to account for the
sale proceeds to those administering the deceased estate of Mr Edwardes.
for the broader issues raised by the interlocutory application dated
3 July 2025, there can be no utility in any of the matters
be raised following the death of the protected person. For example, there is
now no point in invoking
parens patriae
habeas corpus
principles.
The determination of the appeal and the
interlocutory application
called the matter on and given the applicant an opportunity to address the
Court, I am satisfied that this is a proper case
in which to summarily dismiss
the appeal and the interlocutory
application.

any reasonable prospect of succeeding. There
is no prospect that permission to
appeal will be given, or that interlocutory relief will be granted.

commenced on 3 July 2025, should both be summarily dismissed.
