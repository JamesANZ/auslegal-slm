(Respondent/Tenant)
REASONS FOR DECISION
tenancy commenced on 11 August 2007 initially for a fixed term of 1 year in
respect of residential premises at Gungahlin at a
rent of $466.00 per week. A
bond of $1860.00 was lodged with the Office of Rental Bonds.
tenants fell into substantial rent arrears and following a Notice to Remedy the
landlord served the tenants with a Notice to Vacate
on 22 August 2008 requiring
possession on 9 September 2008. Prescribed term 92 of the
Residential
Tenancies Act
(the Act) permits the landlord to serve such a notice if
the tenants are more than 1 week in arrears of rent at the time of service
the notice and for the notice to require possession within 2 weeks of service. A
copy of the notice was produced to the Tribunal
and was valid in all respects.
The tenants did not vacate in response to this notice.
23 September 2008 the landlords served the tenants with a second Notice to
Vacate requiring possession on 24 November 2008. This
notice was issued pursuant
to prescribed term 96(1)(d) of the Act based on the landlords intention to sell
the premises which requires
the landlord to give the tenants 8 weeks from the
date of service in which to vacate the premises. A copy of the notice was
to the Tribunal and was valid in all respects.
tenants did not vacate the premises in response to either notice and the matter
was listed before the Tribunal on 16 December
2008. On that occasion Ms McGavin,
real estate agent, appeared for the landlord and Katy Desa appeared in
Tribunal was informed by the landlords agent that the rent was paid only to 10
October 2008 and was presently in arrears to the
extent of $4289.00. The tenant
conceded this.
tenant informed the Tribunal that due to certain domestic circumstances that she
wished to end the tenancy and the parties agreed
on a date for possession of 13
January 2009.
Tribunal then made the standard for possession on that date which included that
the rent calculated to be owing as at 13 January
2009 of $4393.71 be paid on or
before that date. In addition the Tribunal ordered that the tenants continue to
pay their weekly rent
until 13 January 2009 for which credit would then be given
from the arrear calculation referred to above.
copy of the orders of the Tribunal were sent to the parties.
19 December 2008 solicitors for the landlord requested a statement of reasons
for the above decision.
the consent nature of the orders the Registrar was instructed to ascertain
precisely what elements of the decision were of concern
to the landlords’
solicitors.
landlords’ solicitors advised that their concern was that order 9 of the
Tribunal’s orders omitted a date by which
the rent arrears had to be paid
by the tenant. A perusal of the file revealed that the handwritten orders of the
Tribunal clear specified
the date for payment to be 13 January 2009 whereas the
specified only “January 2009”. This was a clerical order in the
transcription of the orders made. It should have
caused no confusion because
both parties were present at the Tribunal on the day when the orders were
pronounced and explained.
Tribunal understands the landlords need for clarification but in cases such as
this it would be far quicker and less costly to
the public purse of the affected
party to simply indicate the existence of the clerical error to the Registrar
who has power to correct
such errors.
