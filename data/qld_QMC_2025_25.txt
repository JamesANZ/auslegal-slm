INTRODUCTION
[1] The plaintiff has commenced proceedings claiming $17,734 as
a liquidated debt in respect of the provision of design and production
for the publication of a magazine. The plaintiff appears to have commenced
proceedings against Ms Alicia Fistonich and Mr
Deon Haar upon the basis that
they were both directors of Strong Fitness Magazine Australia Pty Ltd (SFMA).
[2] The parties have each filed an application for summary judgement.
THE APPLICATIONS
[3] The parties have filed applications (by date of
filing) as follows:
First Defendant
[4] The first defendant applies for
the following orders:
1) Summary judgement pursuant to r 293
Uniform Civil
Procedure Rules 1999
(Qld) (UCPR) on the plaintiff’s claim.
2) Alternatively pursuant to r 171 UCPR that the statement of claim be
struck out against the first defendant.
3) The plaintiff pay the first
defendant’s costs.
Second Defendant
[5] The second defendant
applies for the following orders:
1) Summary judgement pursuant to r 293 on
the plaintiff’s claim.
2) The plaintiff pay the second
defendant’s costs.
[6] The plaintiff applies for the
following orders:
1) Summary judgement pursuant to r 293 UCPR for the
plaintiff against both the first and second defendants.
Corporations Act 2001
(Cth) the directors of Strong Fitness Magazine failed
their duty to prevent apparent insolvent trading of the company Strong Fitness
Magazine Pty Ltd. This resulted in the company being unable to pay their debts
owing the plaintiff prior to it being deregistered
by ASIC by 26 May 2024.
3) Both the first and second defendants pay the plaintiff’s costs.
[7] In respect of the plaintiff’s application:
1) The relief
sought at paragraph 2 is ultra vires the jurisdiction of the Magistrate’s
and no such power is conferred by
Corporations Act 2001
2) The application is expressed to be
pursuant to r 293 but in fact is an application for summary judgement by the
plaintiff pursuant
THE PARTIES’ MATERIAL
[8] The first
defendant relies on the following material:
1) First defendant’s
application for summary judgement filed 6 February 2025
2) Affidavit of
Alicia Fistonich filed 6 February 2025
[9] The second defendant relies on
the following material:
1) Second defendant’s defence filed 25 March
2) Second defendant’s application for summary judgement filed 28
February 2025
3) Affidavit of Deon Haar filed 28 February 2025
first defendant and second defendant have each provided an outline of
[11] The plaintiff did not provide an outline of argument,
understandable as he appeared pro se by a director Mr Hannon. In the course
hearing the plaintiff’s submissions it became apparent that the plaintiff
relied on the following:
1) Plaintiff’s claim and statement of claim
filed 7 September 2023
2) The plaintiff’s application for summary
judgement filed 12 March 2025
3) Affidavit of Benjamin Hannon filed 12 March
THE RELEVANT RULES
[12] The UCPR empowers this court to grant
summary judgement in respect of the plaintiff’s claim against the
[13] Rule 292 provides:
292 Summary judgement for plaintiff
(1) The plaintiff may, at any time after a defendant files a notice of
intention to defend, apply to the court under this part for
judgement against
the defendant.
(2) If the court is satisfied that –
(a) The defendant has no real prospect of successfully defending all or a part
of the plaintiff’s claim; and there is no need
to a trial of the claim or
the part of the claim;
(b) There is no need for a trial of the claim or part
of the claim.
The court may give judgement for the plaintiff against the defendant for all or
part of the plaintiff’s claim and may make
any other order the court
considers appropriate.
[14] The plaintiff’s application mistakenly
refers to r 293, it should be r 292.
[15] The first and second
defendants’ applications are pursuant to r 293.
[16] Rule 293 provides
as follows:
293 Summary judgement for defendant
(1) A defendant may, at any time after a defendant files a notice of intention
to defend, apply to the court under this part for
judgement against a plaintiff.
(2) If the court is satisfied –
(a) The plaintiff has no real prospect of succeeding on all or part of the
plaintiff’s claim; and
(b) There is no need for a trial of the claim
or part of the claim.
The court may give judgement for the defendant against
the plaintiff for all or part of the plaintiff’s claim and may make any
other order the court considers appropriate.
THE RELEVANT LEGAL PRINCIPLES
[17] In determining applications for summary
judgement (pursuant to rule 292 and rule 293) this court is bound by the
statements of
principle contained in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v
where it is held:
Summary judgement
will not be obtained as a matter of course and the Judge determining such an
application is essentially called upon
to determine whether the respondent to
the application has established some real prospect at succeeding at trial, if
that is established
then the matter must go to trial.
[18] At paragraph 44 of
the judgement Atkinson J stated:
In the case of an application by the
Plaintiff, the court must consider if it is satisfied that:
(a) The Defendant has no real prospect of successfully defending all or part of
the Plaintiff’s claim; and,
(b) There is no need for trial of the
claim or part of the claim.
If the court is satisfied of those circumstances then it has the discretion to
give judgement for the Plaintiff and make any other
order that it considers
appropriate. Similar criteria apply to an application by a defendant pursuant to
[19] Her Honour continued at paragraph 47 and further held:
... The court must consider whether there exists a real, as opposed to
fanciful, prospect of success. If there is no real prospect
that a party will be
successful in all or part of a claim and there is no need for a trial, then
ordinarily the other party is entitled
to judgement.
[20] In Queensland
Building Services Authority v Orenshaw &
Henry J said in respect of the relevant
The words ‘no real prospect of proceeding’ mean what they
say. They are to be applied in conjunction with required satisfaction
is no need for a trial, so as to ensure before any summary intervention that
there is a high degree of certainty about
what the ultimate outcome of the
proceeding would be if it were allowed to go to trial in the ordinary way.
[21] Whilst those authorities require the court to apply the rule giving the
words their usual and ordinary meanings and without further
amplification, their
practical application to particular circumstances was considered comprehensively
by Chesterman J in Jessop v
Lawyers Private Mortgages Ltd &
[22] His Honour at paragraphs 18 and
19 of the decision considered the earlier authorities and the proposition that
the wording of
the rule ought to be given its “plain and unambiguous
meaning.” His Honour adopted a convenient and practical approach
application of the rule and held at paragraph 20.
If summary judgement is
not to work on an injustice it must be limited to those cases where it can be
seen that a plaintiff or defendant,
as the case may be, could not succeed at a
trial of the action. It is only where a trial can be seen to be pointless that
should be entered summarily. Whatever form of words one uses the
reality must be that it will only be just to deprive a party of
its right to
prosecute its claim or defence at trial where it can be seen that the claim or
defence cannot succeed. If it might succeed,
if there is a possibility of
success, it cannot be just (though it might be expeditious) to enter summary
[23] His Honour continued at paragraph 21:
In practical terms
I suspect the rule means (as the old rules meant) that summary judgement should
not be given where the facts upon
which the parties respective rights depend are
disputed, or where the respondent to the application for summary judgement
evidence as to the existence of facts, which if proved, would establish
a defence or right to relief. In other words it is only where
all the facts are
known and/or established beyond controversy that the court should embark upon
determining whether to give summary
judgement. Where relevant facts are
converted, or where it appears that facts may exist which would effect a right
of action or defence,
there should be a trial to determine the
[24] In approaching the disposition of the present application I
proceed adopting the test enunciated by Chesterman J at paragraph
23 of Jessop v
Lawyers Private Mortgages Ltd & Ors
is, I approach the applications on the basis that I should give judgement only
if satisfied that there are uncontroverted facts
proved by the material read in
the application which show an entitlement in law to the relief claimed by the
party, and that there
is no evidence to suggest the existence of additional
facts which, if provided would controvert those facts.
SUMMARY JUDGEMENT
APPLICATION – THE TEST
[25] The relevant test for a summary judgement
application is the same whether the application is by a plaintiff pursuant to r
or a defendant pursuant to r 293.
[26] The first question is whether the
plaintiff or defendant have no real prospect of succeeding or defending all or
part of the
[27] In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Salcedo the
court said that means no real prospects as opposed to fanciful
The applicant satisfies that only
if I consider that there is a high degree of certainty about the ultimate
outcome of the proceeding
if it were to go to trial in the ordinary
[28] The second questions under r 292
or r 293 is whether there is no need for a trial of the relevant claim. That is,
despite a defendant
having no prospect of success, based on the evidence
available at the hearing of the summary judgement application there may be
for the court to consider that there should be a trial in any event.
[29] The plaintiff or defendant must satisfy the court that both of those
tests are met to succeed in the application.
[30] Both of those tests must
be satisfied by the applicant to succeed in the application. The application
should be refused if the
court is satisfied that there are circumstances that
ought to be investigated, notwithstanding that the opposing party cannot
a specific issue which ought to be tried. The onus is on the applicant
to satisfy the court of those two requirements, and only when
a prima facie
entitlement to summary judgement has been established does the evidentiary
burden shift to the defendants.
power to order a summary judgement must be exercised with great care and only if
it is clear that there is no real question
THE PLEADINGS
[32] The relevant
pleadings are:
- Statement of claim filed 7 September 2023
- Defence of
the first defendant filed 6 February 2025
- Defence of the second defendant
filed 25 March 2024
[33] The plaintiff appears pro se, without the benefit
of legal advice or legal representation. The statement of claim appears to
been drafted by Mr Hannon as director of the plaintiff.
[34] As both
defendants properly complain, the statement of claim does not comply with the
pleading’s rules of the UCPR and
does not plead a cause of action known at
[35] The rules of pleading pursuant to the UCPR provide that a pleading
(a) Contain a statement of all material facts on which the party relies but
not the evidence.
(b) Plead a conclusion
of law or raise a point of law if the party also pleads the material facts in
(c) Plead specific matters
including breach of contract or trust and every type of damage
(d) For a debt or liquidated
demand particulars of the debt or liquidated demand and interest
(e) Include in a pleading
particulars necessary to define the issues and enable the opposite party to
[36] The statement of claim addresses none of those pleading rules. Paragraphs 1
to 22 appear to attempt to plead evidence rather
than material facts and are a
mishmash of alleged evidence about conversations and other communications.
[37] The plaintiff does not plead any alleged agreement between SFMA nor
either the first or second defendant and as best can be gleaned
pleading, in the prayer for relief the plaintiff claims
Payment for the
balance owing on outstanding invoice dated 29 January 2020 and outstanding
invoice dated 20 May 2020 totalling $21,340.16.
[38] Not only as there no
properly pleaded claim or a cause of action against SFMA, but the second
defendant is not mentioned in the
pleading and there is no claim pleaded against
him. The current pleaded claim against the second defendant must fail.
[39] The pleaded claim against the first defendant identifies her in
paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18, 19, and 20.
[40] Taken at its highest, noting the noncompliant pleading, those
paragraphs simply purport to plead evidence of interactions as
between the
plaintiff (through its officers or staff) and the first defendant Ms Fistonich
– as director as Strong Fitness
Magazine Australia Pty Ltd.
[41] Paragraphs 10 and 11 of the statement of claim purport to plead that
the first defendant agreed to enter a deed of guarantee
in respect of a debt,
but no such deed of guarantee was signed and returned. Paragraph 11 pleads
In the email Alicia Fistonich advised she would have signed deed of
guarantee dated 9 March 2023 returned overnight. This means Alicia
(director of Strong Fitness Magazine) agreed to the terms of the guarantee dated
9 March 2023 and is now personally liable
for the debt.
[42] The plaintiff
fails to plead a cause of action against SFMA. Upon that basis, with no proven
debt, the affect of a purported
guarantee is unknown.
[43] The plaintiff has
failed to plead a cause of action against SFMA and the potential pleaded cause
against Ms Fistonich as director
and guarantor must similarly fail.
[44] There is no pleaded case by the plaintiff against the first defendant.
THE PARTIES’ EVIDENCE
[45] The evidence of the parties in this
proceeding is by way of
[46] The evidence of the
parties is as follows.
The First Defendant
[47] In her affidavit Ms
Fistonich deposes to the following:
- She was a director of Strong Fitness
Magazine Australia Pty Ltd.
- The company engaged the services of the
plaintiff pursuant to a contract attached to a form of quotation accepted by the
- All invoices issued to the plaintiff were issued solely to the
- She did not personally engage the services of the plaintiff or
enter into a contract with the plaintiff.
- She did not sign or enter into
any deed of guarantee on behalf of the company with the plaintiff.
Second Defendant
[48] In the affidavit of Mr Haar, he deposes
uncontroversially to the following:
- He was previously a director of Strong
Fitness Magazine Australia Pty Ltd.
- The company was deregistered on 26 May
- He never personally contacted the plaintiff and all of the
quotations or other correspondence from the plaintiff were never sent
- He never signed or entered into any contract with the plaintiff.
never personally guaranteed the obligations of the company or the first
The Plaintiff
[49] In his affidavit Mr Hannon deposes to the
- The plaintiff provided creative proofs to the first defendant.
- The company was invoiced for the work undertaken.
- The plaintiff
submitted a deed of guarantee to the first defendant, but the deed of guarantee
was not signed and returned.
[50] In respect of the evidence, taking the
plaintiff’s evidence at its highest, that evidence is consistent with the
of any properly pleaded case by the plaintiff against the first or
second defendants.
[51] The plaintiff’s evidence does not prove:
- That either the first or second defendants contracted with the plaintiff
- Indeed, the plaintiff’s evidence is that the company(SMFA)
contracted with the plaintiff
- All invoices and other documents were issued
by the plaintiff to the company(SMFA).
- The second defendant was never
requested and did not give any guarantee in respect of the debt
- The first
defendant did not sign or enter any guarantee in respect of the debt.
[52] There are no facts upon which the parties’ respective rights
depend which are disputed and no facts which would establish
plaintiff’s right of relief against the first or second defendants.
THE PLAINTIFF REPLEAD A CAUSE OF ACTION?
[53] The plaintiff has not
specifically raised the prospect of seeking to replead its case as against the
first and second defendants.
If there were a potential viable cause of action,
that may be a consideration, especially having regard to the enunciation of the
test by Chesterman J where a party’s position could be improved by amended
pleading such that it could be established if there
were reasonable prospects of
[54] The difficulty for the
plaintiff in respect of the alleged guarantee is that such a potential claim is
defeated by the provisions
Property Law Act 1974
Property Law Act 1974
(Qld) provides as follows:
56 Guarantees to be in
(1) No action may be brough upon any promise to guarantee any
liability of another unless the promise upon which such action is brought,
some memorandum or note of the promise, is in writing, and signed by the party
to be charged, or by some other person by the party
lawfully authorised.
[56] The effect of
Property Law Act 1974
(Qld) is that absent a
signed note or memorandum constituting the guarantee, the plaintiff cannot
succeed against the first defendant
CONSIDERATION
plaintiff has no pleaded cause of action as against either the first defendant
or second defendant.
[58] The plaintiff may have (if properly pleaded) a
cause of action against Strong Fitness Magazine Australia Pty Ltd but there is
no pleaded particular of either the first or second defendant’s engaging
or contracting with the plaintiff.
[59] The second defendant is in fact not
mentioned at all in the pleading.
[60] The plaintiff could not succeed if it
had a claim for a debt against SFMA, against the first defendant in respect of
guarantee noting its failure to comply with the provisions of
Property Law Act 1974
[61] The plaintiff’s claim against
the first and second defendants is misconceived and doomed to fail. The
plaintiff has no
prospects, let alone no reasonable prospects.
[62] Both the
first and second defendants have satisfied the requirements of r 293 and I am
satisfied that:
(a) The plaintiff has no real prospects of succeeding on the claim against
either the first or second defendant.
(b) There is no need for a trial of
[63] The first and second defendants are both entitled to summary judgement on
the claim against them.
PLAINTIFF’S SUMMARY JUDGEMENT APPLICATION
[64] The plaintiff’s summary judgement application pursuant to r 292
is similarly misconceived and doomed to fail.
[65] The plaintiff on an
application for summary judgement must relevantly establish that each of the
first and second defendant’s
have no real prospect of successfully
defending the claim and that there is no need for a trial.
[66] The reasons
articulated above conclusively demonstrate to the contrary. Both defendants have
very real and strong prospects of
successfully defending the claim brought
against them.
[67] The plaintiff’s application for summary judgement
DISPOSITION
1) I give judgement for the first defendant
against the plaintiff and dismiss the plaintiff’s claim.
judgement for the second defendant against the plaintiff and dismiss the

2025 is dismissed.
