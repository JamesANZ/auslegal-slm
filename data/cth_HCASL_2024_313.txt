Ms Sacco v Mr Allan & Anor [2024] HCASL 313 (5 December 2024)
[2024] HCASL 313
applicant seeks special leave to appeal from a judgment of the Federal Circuit
and Family Court of Australia (Division 1) Appellate
(Aldridge, Altobelli and Schonell JJ) ("the Full Court"), which allowed an
appeal brought by the applicant from a decision
of the Federal Circuit and
Family Court of Australia (Division 1) (Baumann J, "the primary
judge"). The Full Court found error on
the part of the primary judge, and
the matter was remitted for rehearing before a judge other than the primary
proposed ground of appeal in the applicant's application does not raise a
question of law that is suitable for the grant of special
leave to appeal.
An appeal to this Court would enjoy no prospects of success.
leave to appeal refused.
