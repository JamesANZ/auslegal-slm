DEPUTY PRESIDENT WRIGHT
SYDNEY, 12 NOVEMBER 2025
Application for approval of the Trafman Labour Hire Collective Agreement
Introduction
Trafman Labour Hire Pty Ltd (the Employer) has made an application
for approval of an enterprise agreement known as the
Trafman Labour Hire
Collective Agreement 2025-2028
(the Agreement) pursuant to s.185 of
Fair Work Act 2009
(the Act). The Agreement is a single
enterprise agreement.
The Agreement will apply to employees who are covered by the
Building and Construction General On-site Award 2020
(the Award).
Casual Employees Entitled to Vote
The Commission identified that 102 casual employees (out of 128
employees) were included by the Employer as employees eligible to
participate in
the vote on the Agreement. The Employer provided submissions that the casual
employees invited to vote were all employed
by the business on a regular and
systematic basis and rostered to work during the access period.
I am satisfied that in light of the Full Bench decision in
by Kmart Australia Limited t/a Kmart and
requirement in s.181(1) of the Act has been met.
Sufficient Interest and Sufficiently Representative
The Form F17B submitted by the Employer did not include adequate
information about whether employees have a sufficient interest in
the terms of
the Agreement or were sufficiently representative of the employees it intends to
The Employer subsequently provided submissions which included
information about each of the roles that employees are employed in under
Agreement and the number of employees engaged in those roles. Based on those
submissions I am satisfied that the employees requested
to approve the Agreement
by voting for it have a sufficient interest in the terms of the agreement and
are sufficiently representative.
Workplace delegates’ rights term
The Agreement does not contain a workplace delegates’ right
term as required by s.205A(1) of the Act. Pursuant to s.205A(2)
of the Act, the
workplace delegates’ right term from the Award is taken to be a term of
the Agreement. A copy of the workplace
delegates’ rights term can be found
in Schedule 2.
Inconsistencies with the National Employment Standards
The Commission raised the following issues with the Employer as to
whether some aspects of the Agreement are inconsistent with the
14.1(e) states an employee will be granted paid personal/carer's leave up to the
limit of his/her accrued entitlement if he/she
is absent from work due to
personal illness or injury subject to the employee notifying the company within
24 hours where practicable
of the commencement of the personal/carer's leave.
This may be inconsistent with s.107(2) of the Act which provides for notice to
be given as soon as reasonably practicable (which may be a time after the leave
has started).
21.1.1(c) appears to provide that redundancy does not apply to apprentices,
inconsistent with s.123(1)(d) of the Act which
does not preclude apprentices
from the entitlement to redundancy provided by s.119.
Better off Overall Test (BOOT) Issue –
Apprentice Rates
Clause 21.1.1(c) refers to apprentices, however, rates of pay have
not been provided. The Employer submitted that no apprentices are
engaged under the terms of the Agreement and there is no intention to engage
apprentices during the life of the Agreement.
Section 190 Undertakings
The Employer provided written undertakings to address the above NES
and BOOT issues. A copy of the undertakings is attached in Schedule
satisfied that the undertakings will not cause financial detriment to any
employee covered by the Agreement and that the
undertakings will not result in
substantial changes to the Agreement. The undertakings are taken to be a term of
the Agreement.
Section 186, 187, 188 and 190
Subject to the undertakings referred to above, I am satisfied that
each of the requirements of ss.186, 187, 188 and 190 as are relevant
application for approval have been met.
The Agreement is approved and, in accordance with s.54 of the Act,
will operate from 19 November 2025. The nominal expiry date of
the Agreement is
30 June 2028.
