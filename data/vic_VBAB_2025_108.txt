DETERMINATION AND ORDERS

Appeals Board determines that it would not be

_______________________ ________________________
Lodge Registrar M Finlay
INTRODUCTION
the consent of the parties, the Building Appeals Board (
) made orders
dated 7 August 2024:
(a) quashing the relevant building surveyor’s (
) determination
under s 87 of the Building Act 1993 (Act);
(b) providing that parties may apply for costs (
costs claim
), subject to
such liberty being exercised by 5 September 2024; and
(c) providing that submissions in reply (if any) by the parties, would need to
be filed and served within 3 weeks of receiving the
costs claim.
5 September 2024, the Applicants (
Adjoining Owners
) sought orders from
the BAB ‘for costs to be awarded in favour of the Applicants and against
the Respondent and Interested
Party, in the amount of $8,377.78, however the
[BAB] deems appropriate.’
SUBMISSIONS OF THE
Submissions of the Adjoining Owners
Adjoining Owners submitted that:
(a) the Owners repeatedly issued deficient versions of the Form 7 to the
Adjoining Owners;
(b) the Adjoining Owners, guided by their building surveyor, consistently made
their view known, for over two years, that the Form
7 was deficient and because
of that any determination of the RBS would be quashed. The various iterations of
the deficient Form 7
are as follows:
(i) Form 7 dated 19 November 2021 (received on 21 November 2021);
(ii) Form 7 dated 24 May 2022 (received 25 May 2022);
(iii) Form 7 dated 4 October 2023 (received on 30 October 2023); and
(iv) Form 7 dated 9 July 2024 (received on 2 August 2024).
Adjoining Owners also noted that the matter was further confused and prolonged
by the final Form 7 (9 July 2024) being issued
after the determination of the
RBS dated 3 June 2024. No explanation was provided as to why this Form 7 was
issued completely outside
the protection works process under the Act, causing
the Adjoining Owners to again waste resources and time in considering it.
Adjoining Owners were subsequently forced to commence the proceeding in relation
to the determination made by the RBS dated 3
June 2024, notwithstanding the fact
that the Owner and the RBS had over two years to properly complete the
protection works process
in accordance with the Act.
Adjoining Owners submitted that the Interested Parties (
vexatiously litigated the proceeding.
Adjoining Owners sought costs of $8,377.78 from the Owners and/or the RBS,
(a) legal fees - $7,219.30;
(b) fees to the building surveyor - $742.50;
(c) fee to Landata- $39.74; and
(d) fees to the BAB (to bring the proceeding) - $376.24.
RBS’ submissions
RBS opposed costs being awarded against the RBS on the following
(a) the RBS is not the owner and he has no financial responsibility for
protection works;
(b) the Adjoining Owners agreed to quash the Form 9, so their cost claim is
unnecessary;
(c) there was no delay or misconduct from the RBS in his handling of this
matter; and
(d) the law states each party pays their own costs, and there is no reason to
depart from this position.
The Owners did not make submissions
Owners did not provide submissions opposing the costs order.
regard to the BAB’s orders dated 7 August 2024, parties which were served
with a Costs Claim were required to file a
Defence to Costs Claim by 26
September 2024.
BAB provided a follow up email on 9 October 2024 and a further email (and a
text) in January 2025.
30 January 2025, the Owners advised that the retaining wall, which was the
subject of the protection work appeal before the BAB,
is not yet built, and
... Therefore, it is fair to discuss the costs once we got
permission to rebuild the retaining wall until then there is no point to
Once more I repeat my request for your esteemed board to rule that the
retaining wall to be permitted to be rebuilt as currently it
is not safe and
could collapse any minute.
receipt of the email of 30 January 2025, the BAB wrote to all of the parties,
noting that there was no matter before the
BAB relating to the rebuilding of the
retaining wall, and the BAB would not wait until that retaining wall was
BAB provided a very short extension of time for submissions, but, as noted
above, the Owners did not provide submissions on costs.
BAB’S JURISDICTION TO AWARD COSTS
BAB has jurisdiction to order that one party pay another party’s costs of
a Board proceeding. Clause 16(2) of Schedule 3
Building Act
The determination may include any
order as to costs that the Building Appeals Board, on the application of a party
to the proceeding,
considers is just.
17 of Schedule 3 to the Act provides:
Unless the Building
Appeals Board otherwise determines, a party to a proceeding before the Board
must bear his, her or its own costs.
15(3)(f) of Schedule 3 to the Act provides:
The Building
Appeals Board— ...
(f) must proceed with as little formality and technicality and with as much
expedition as the requirements of this Act and the regulations
and the proper
consideration of the matter before it permit; and ....
v Building Practitioners
considered the operation of cl 17 of sch 3 to the
His Honour stated:
is clear from clause 17 that the Board does have power to make an order for
costs. It establishes a general rule, namely, that
there should be no order as
to costs. But, it is clear that the Board may, in appropriate circumstances,
refuse to follow the general
rule and make an order for costs. One looks in vain
to find any criterion to guide the Board when application is made to override
the general rule and order costs.
in my opinion, the presence of the general rule requires that circumstances must
be established to override the general rule,
and that means something more than
being a successful party.
Accordingly,
the question of costs is guided by the principle that there must be
circumstances which override the general rule in
proceedings before the Board;
namely, that the parties must bear their own costs, before it will consider
making an order for costs.
approach is consistent with the opinion of Bell J in
Martin v Fasham Johnson
, in discussing the
costs discretion of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (another
‘bear own costs’ jurisdiction).
In that case, his Honour stated
discretion must be exercised judicially, which means that the Tribunal must act
fairly, impartially and by reference to relevant
considerations and not
arbitrarily, capriciously or by reference to irrelevant considerations and not
in a manner that frustrates
the legislative intent. ...
Tribunal is a creature of statute and, on the question of costs, it commences
from a different starting point. Usually parties
must bear their own costs,
which no doubt reflects the general object of the Act. That object .... is to
promote access to justice
generally and to minimise the overall level of costs
in tribunal proceedings as far as practicable.
clause 16(2) of Schedule 3 to the Act does not give any guidance as to what
circumstances an order for costs is
considered just
, the mere fact that
the Adjoining Owners were successful in their application does not, of itself,
justify a costs order in its favour.
There must be circumstances that justify
overriding the general rule that the parties bear their own
a costs application, there are two principal issues:
(a) firstly whether costs should be awarded; and
(b) secondly, if cost are awarded, the quantum of those costs.
Whether costs should be awarded
7 of the Act
reflects a general
position that:
(a) the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by an adjoining owner are
reimbursed by the owner; and
(b) the owner must compensate any adjoining owner for inconvenience, loss or
damage suffered in connection with the protection work.
scheme reflects that the adjoining owner is forced to be involved in protection
works as a result of the building work of the
owner, whereas the owner is
involved as a result of their decisions regarding the proposed building
it is still necessary to find something more than the mere success of the
adjoining owner.
on the information provided to the BAB, the BAB does not accept the submissions
of the Adjoining Owners that the RBS and Owners
conducted the proceeding (or the
protection works negotiations) vexatiously.
the parties agree to quash a determination under s 87 of the Act, it is often
difficult to determine whether:
(a) the s 87 determination was clearly invalid; or
(b) the owner was generously allowing the process to recommence, so that the
adjoining owner could present their information again
to the RBS, despite there
being strong grounds supporting the determination, in law.
would generally be against the intention of the Act for the BAB to conduct a
detailed examination of the lawfulness of a s 87 determination,
determine a costs application.
given that the RBS is an independent officer that exercises statutory power, the
RBS generally adopts a ‘Hardiman’
approach, whereby the effective
contradictor is the interested party (ie the adjoining owner), rather than the
RBS. As a general
observation, costs in an appeal against s 87 determination are
more likely to be awarded against the owner (ie interested party)
rather than
the RBS (despite the RBS making the
on the submissions of the parties, this did not appear to be a case where the
owner had sought to resile from the s 87 determination
before the appeal to the
BAB was commenced.
this case, based on the submissions and information provided, and the actions of
the party, there were reasonable arguments to
support a cost order against the
(a) the Owners issued a fresh Form 7 after the purported s 87 determination was
(b) issuing a fresh Form 7 is arguably incompatible with submissions that the s
87 was effective in law and added complexity to the
(c) the issuing of four Form 7s arguably indicated that there have been problems
with the process that has been adopted by the Owners,
which has resulted in the
Adjoining Owners needing to incur expenses, and needing to initiate an appeal
against the s 87 determination;
(d) the Adjoining Owners needed to initiate this appeal, so that an
inappropriate s 87 determination was not implemented.
despite the arguments in support of a costs order, ultimately, the BAB was not
persuaded to award costs against the Owners
or RBS on this occasion:
(a) given the duty under clause 15(3)(f) of Schedule 3 to the Act, it would be
inappropriate for the Board to determine the merits
of an application, when
there are consent orders to quash a determination – accordingly, it would
be inappropriate to assess
whether the matters outlined in paragraphs (a) to (d)
of clause 31 above are accepted by the Board; and
(b) in the absence of finding for the Adjoining Owner on the matters outlined in
paragraphs (a) to (d) of clause 31 above, there
is insufficient basis for
awarding costs in this matter.
that the BAB has determined that it would not be appropriate to award costs in
this matter, there is no need to consider the
quantum of costs.
DETERMINATION DATED: 2 September 2025
The Adjoining Owners initially
filed an invoice and a ‘pre-Bill’. However, in January 2025, with
the leave of the BAB,
the Adjoining Owners filed an invoice in substitution for
the ‘pre-Bill’ and

Practitioners Board
Martin v Fasham
Johnson Pty Ltd
See, particularly, ss 97
and 98 of the Act.
This is analogous to
successful appeals to the Supreme Court against decisions of the BAB, where
costs are more likely to be awarded
against the active contradictor, rather than
against the BAB.
