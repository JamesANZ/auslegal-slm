REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
application was filed on 22 July 2009. It is an application for an adjustment
of the lot entitlements in the Contribution Schedule
of the community titles
scheme known as “Pindari Lodge” Community Titles Scheme 12391
applicant is a joint owner of Lot 3 in the CTS (which comprises 3 lots only).
The application is brought pursuant to
Body Corporate and
Community Management Act 1997
(“BCCM Act”), as facilitated by
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act 2003
Body Corporate is the respondent. The application seeks an adjustment to give
equal entitlements to all lots in the Contribution
Schedule. The current
entitlements are: Lot 1 – 27; Lot 2 – 27; and Lot 3 –
defence, filed 17 August 2009, contains many denials, alleges that there are
relevant differences between Lot 3 and Lots 1 and
2 and, after raising certain
factual matters, claims that the owners of Lots 1 and 2 would be willing to
agree to an adjustment,
although one whereby Lot 3 would have a lot entitlement
of 40 and the other two would have lot entitlements of 30 each.
28 September 2009 the Tribunal ordered that, by consent, the application was to
be determined by the Tribunal “
on the papers
Relevant legislation and legal principles
reference to a decision “
on the papers
” is a reference to
section 48 of the CCT Act. It states where, as here, the parties to the
proceeding agree, the Tribunal
may decide all of the proceeding from a
consideration of the documents filed, without the parties or witnesses
for the adjustment of the lot entitlements in the contribution schedule, section
48 of the BCCM Act, by section 48(6), states that
the respective lot
entitlements “
should be equal
except to the
extent to which it is just and equitable in the circumstances for them not to be
determining the criteria for deciding just and equitable circumstances, while
section 49(3) states that the matters the Tribunal
may have regard to for
deciding a matter concerning the contribution schedule are not limited to the
matters stated in section 49,
section 49(4) states that the Tribunal may have
regard to –
(a) how the community titles scheme is structured;
(b) the nature, features and characteristics of the lots included in the
scheme; and
(c) the purposes for which the lots are used.
section 49(5) of the BCCM Act, the Tribunal may
have regard to any
knowledge or understanding the applicant had, or any lack of knowledge or
misunderstanding on the part of the
applicant, at the time the applicant entered
into a contract to buy the lot owned by the applicant, about
(a) the lot entitlement for the lot, or other lots included
in the community titles scheme; or
(b) the purpose for which a lot entitlement is used.
but very importantly in a case such as this, section 48(10) of the BCCM Act
states that if the Tribunal orders an adjustment
of the lot entitlement
schedule, the body corporate
, as quickly as practicable, lodge a
request to record a new community management statement reflecting the adjustment
Queensland Court of Appeal has had occasion to consider the adjustment
provisions.
Fischer v Body Corporate for Centrepoint Community Titles Scheme 7779
[2004] QCA 214
[2004] 2 Qd R 638
, it stated the following principles and approaches:
a contribution
schedule should provide for “
equal contributions
owners, except insofar as some lots can be “
rise to particular costs to the body corporate which other lots do not: at 644
considerations of “
amenity, value or history are to be
disregarded
” because what is at issue is the equitable distribution of
”: at 644 [26];
in the relevant
Second Reading Speech it was said that the costs concerning a contribution
schedule should be borne “in
proportion to the benefit, not in
proportion to the unit’s value
” since it “
contribution linked to an ability to pay, but as a payment for
”: at 645 [29];
is intended to produce a contribution lot entitlement schedule which
divides body corporate expenses equally, except to the extent
that the lots
disproportionately
” give rise to those expenses, or
disproportionately
” consume services: at 645 [30];
the starting
point for an adjustment is that the entitlements “
” and a departure from that principle is allowable
” where it is just, or fair, to recognise inequality,
with the focus of the inquiry being the extent to which a lot
unequally causes
” costs to the body corporate: at 645 [31];
section 49 of
the BCCM Act, and in particular section 49(4), should be construed as meaning
that those identified matters to which
a court may have regard are to be
” to the extent “
that they affect the “
cost of operating
” a community titles
scheme: at 646 [33].
to the application are 7 photographs, a note to Motion 17 which had sought, by a
resolution without dissent, that all lot
entitlements in the Contribution
Schedule be equal (which was defeated), an Administrative Fund Budget, a Sinking
Fund Budget, a
Sinking Fund Forecast Report and various extracts from relevant
Building Units Plans and the relevant Community Management Statement.
denies that all
common areas are shared equally (without explaining why);
asserts that Lot
3 is a larger unit with 3 bedrooms, in contrast to the smaller units with 2
bedrooms for Lots 1 and 2;
asserts that
there is a potential for Lot 3 to accommodate more residents, have more visitors
and cars, with a proportionally greater
extent of wear and tear on common
takes issue with
the photograph No. 4 by asserting that it does not show a complete “common
area” because some of the
land is a council easement;
asserts that not
only has Lot 3 significantly greater floor area but larger balcony space with
balustrading, more windows, guttering,
eaves and roof area with the sizes being,
respectively: Lot 1 – 102 square metres; Lot 2 – 107 square metres;
3 – 173 square metres;
asserts that a
relatively greater share of costs would be apportionable to Lot 3 for
maintenance and insurance/replacement;
asserts that,
since there is common water meter and an asserted greater use of water by Lot 3
“due to potential (usually actual)
larger number of residents”, an
equality of lot entitlements would incur unreasonable excess water charges;
asserts that Lot
3 could attract not only a higher rent but a higher resale value.
24 August 2009 the applicants filed in the Tribunal a report, in letter form,
from Leary & Partners Pty Ltd dated 20 August
2009 which reviewed
information supplied by the applicant.
that order referred to of 28 September 2009, the Tribunal noted on the record
that neither party wished to file any additional
Consideration
the report of Leary & Partners Pty Ltd (“L & P Report”) has
been filed in order to assist the Tribunal by
performing the relevant mechanical
exercise concerning an analysis of the various Funds relevant to this CTS and
how the costs contained
in those funds should be allocated throughout the Scheme
according to how the various Lots give rise to such expenses, or consume
services, as are contained in the costs in those Funds, the Tribunal will move
to a consideration of that Report first and then,
later, deal with any issues
that still remain unresolved arising from the defence filed by the Body
the application is to be determined by a consideration of the documents filed
and because this order was made “
”, the Tribunal
has taken, in the small areas where there has been a disputation of fact, the
relevant fact as being that contained
in the L & P Report.
that basis, considering that the Report has addressed the Budgets for both
Funds, and applying the relevant principles that have
been outlined concerning
the relevant legislation identified, the Tribunal has reached the following
conclusions:
considering that
equality is the starting point, there is no reason to conclude that the costs
that are set out in the Administration
Fund Budget should be shared other than
equally, since there is nothing in the material available to the Tribunal to
show that there
has been any disproportionate cost concerning that Fund that
arises from Lot 3;
concerning the
balcony balustrades, while Lot 1 has none, and Lot 2 and Lot 3 have,
respectively, 23% and 77% of it, such balustrading
has a long life and,
consequently, an extremely limited impact on the annual levies for the Body
Corporate, with the consequence
that there is no substantial reason why equality
concerning the costs should not prevail taking the respective annual totals into
as for window
maintenance, excluding those windows which are within the boundaries of the 3
Lots (for which the responsibility lies
with each Lot owner), again because of
the extremely long life cycle of such windows, the annual cost impact will be
concerning the
painting of balcony soffits, again excluding those areas within Lot boundaries
that are the responsibility of each
separate owner, the yearly allocation leads
to a minimal variation between lots as an annual figure, particularly where
related expenses
of scaffolding and other access equipment should be shared
the Tribunal
agrees with the Report that there is no identification of any common area of the
CTS which is not shared equally, it
being irrelevant that the common property
contains a council easement;
for reasons
which were discussed in
, the mere fact of having different floor
areas does not, without more, lead to any expectation other than equal
contribution schedule
lot entitlements – and there is nothing in the
material given to the Tribunal which shows that there is any such additional
factor here;
there is no
evidence at all that a potentially greater occupancy does directly affect the
cost of any of the items contained in either
Fund such to satisfy the
requirements shown in
that it is necessary to demonstrate that
” costs are being caused to the Body Corporate
where such costs can be “shown” not to arise from the other lots
and, in any event, the potential usage variation where there is a 1 bedroom
difference has not been demonstrated to satisfy that
particular requirement of
identifying a particular figure for costing for Lot 3;
roofing costs,
even in a multi-level building, are for the benefit of all lot owners, because
of the necessity to have a roof that
protects against any weather intrusion
which a roof of that kind should achieve;
the insurance
expenses are an irrelevant consideration, because insurance premiums for the
building itself are based upon the lot
entitlements in the Interest Schedule
(which are irrelevant to this application);
with respect to
the common water meter, it has not been shown here that any difference that does
exist reflects a “
disproportionate
” expense created by Lot 3;
as discussed in
” or earning power of the units is
irrelevant to a determination of the lot entitlements in the Contribution
only matter left in the defence is that concerning the extent of the adjustment
to the lot entitlements in the Contribution Schedule.
demands that the starting point is that all entitlements should be equal and
that a departure is allowable only where it is just,
or fair, to recognise
inequality, with the focus being on any unequally caused costs to the body
corporate, the only conclusion that
can be reached by the Tribunal in this
particular proceeding is that starting point be totally respected. This is
the present lot
entitlements are unequal;
it has not been
demonstrated that it is just and equitable for such, or any, inequality to
persist; and
the equality
principle therefore prevails.
Tribunal will order that the lot entitlements of each of the 3 lots in this CTS
be adjusted such that each lot entitlement is
the figure “1”, it
being noted that section 46(6) of the BCCM Act requires that a lot entitlement
be a whole number,
although it must not be “0”.
is no basis at all for any order to be made for any costs of either party in
this proceeding.
