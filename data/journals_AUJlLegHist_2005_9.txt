The Endeavour had returned to England in July 1771, and Joseph Banks was
elevated into the highest levels of society – he had

inaccurate.
The view had been taken,
erroneously,
that Lieutenant Cook
lacked literary ability to prepare an account for publication, and so, on the
advice of Burney and Garrick,
the Admiralty engaged the journalist Hawkesworth to write the definitive
account, leaving it to him to arrange his publisher. The

paid £500 to Sydney Parkinson’s brother and personal
representative
Stanfield, a common friend Dr John Fothergill acting as an intermediary.
Parkinson then requested that he peruse his
brother’s diary, which was
granted despite Banks’ misgivings and, according to Fothergill but
disputed by Parkinson,

What was not
disputed was that Parkinson caused a copy of his brother’s journal to be
made, and engaged Messrs Richardson and
Urquhart to publish it. After efforts to
buy Parkinson off failed,
Hawkesworth commenced a suit in chancery, and retained the Solicitor-General,

Overawed by Thurlow, Wedderburn and other counsel practising at his bar, he was
so little conversant with either the principles or
practice of equity that his
decisions have no value in the
profession.
Bathurst’s successors, the future Lords Thurlow and Loughborough, were,
in 1773, Attorney General and Solicitor General. They

resist the injunction.
Although there had been no determination of the question of authors’
rights to literary property by common law courts until
common law copyright
had come to be readily protected by the Lord Chancellor. Copyright was seen as
especially apt for injunctive
relief, because damages were inadequate, as the
defendants were often men of straw, the magnitude of the copyright owner’s
loss difficult or impossible to
and because the
common law courts lacked the power to prevent further infringements during, and
after, the trial of the action.
Drawing on the practice in relation to patents, it became standard practice for
a plaintiff to obtain an injunction

natural for those advising Hawkesworth, faced with the very imminent prospect of
an unwelcome competing publication,
to seek to frame his case in copyright,
rather than breach of contract.

£500 in exchange for all of Sydney Parkinson’s papers. That payment
was made on 31 January 1772. On the previous
day, Banks had assigned his right
to Hawkesworth. Following the completion of the manuscript of Cook’s
voyage, Banks lent the
diary to Parkinson allegedly on terms that it be used
solely to check the manuscript,
and in breach of that undertaking, Parkinson retained a copy and took steps to
have it published. The bill prayed for an injunction
in the usual form, and for
delivery up of Sydney Parkinson’s papers in his brother’s
possession.
The bill, which was required to be

On 4 February 1773, Wedderburn, the Solicitor-General, sought and obtained
an injunction. The Register’s Book records the submission

There is no surviving court record of the arguments of the law officers and
any reasons from the chancellor. However, relying in part
upon the preface to
Parkinson’s
, it is possible to hazard an explanation for
what took place.
By 1773, it had been recognised that a common law copyright existed in
unpublished manuscripts, which equity would protect by
injunction.

clerk from publishing draft conveyances which had never

Put thus to the trouble and expence of defending a suit in chancery, and the

continuing the injunction not appearing satisfactory to the court, and indeed
the pretended
transfer of the property in my brother’s manuscripts, from
me to Joseph Banks, and from Joseph Banks to Dr Hawkesworth, being
attended with
a circumstance, that, on the very face of it, might reasonably suggest some
collusion. This was, that the alledged
date of the assignment of such property,
from Banks to Hawkesworth, was prior to that of the receipt for the five hundred
before-mentioned, given by Stanfield and Britannia Parkinson to Banks, on
which the pretended right of the latter to such manuscript
was founded. Can it
be supposed, that a man of Dr Hawkesworth’s discretion and abilities would
enter into an engagement of
this nature, and make a purchase of such moment,
without enquiring into the title of the vender?
Hawkesworth’s
was controversial from the start.
Unsurprisingly, it was not to the taste of Horace Walpole, who wrote

But less sophisticated tastes agreed. Forster wrote that Hawkesworth

universal censure,

Certainly there were
internal contradictions.
Hawkesworth’s placing of classical allusions in the mouths of the captains
jarred, and, much worse, his embellishments had
not been confirmed by the
commanders. Beaglehole describes Cook’s
Cook read them, and was surprised beyond measure; worse, he was
“mortified”. He was mortified because he did not recognise
and could hardly do so when so much of Banks appeared as Cook, with original
nautical blunders by Hawkesworth himself;
he was surprised to learn from the
introduction that the manuscript had been read to him at the Admiralty for his
approval, and such
emendations as he had suggested had been made.
When Cook dined with Boswell on 2 April 1776, he ‘set me right as to

III The Question of Literary
Many detailed accounts of
Millar v Taylor
Donaldson v Becket
in outline, the issue
was whether authors had a property right in their literary works, and if so,
what was the effect of the Statute
of Anne upon that right. As Blackstone noted
in 1766, there had not been ‘any direct determination upon the right of
at the common
although frequently
injunctions had issued in support of what could only be common law copyright.
The interlocutory injunctions were
of little precedential value – it was
clear law that an injunction would issue before a common law right was
established.
This was a matter
for determination by a common law court.
For practical reasons, it was not until 1769 that the question was litigated
in a common law court. Finally, in
Millar v Taylor,
a decision favourable
to the booksellers was obtained from all twelve common law judges, whom
Mansfield CJ had arranged to sit. No
appeal was taken.
For the first time, the London booksellers had secured an authoritative
affirmation of the author’s common law right to print
and publish his work
in perpetuity, and, by extension, had secured their monopoly over the
trade’s most profitable
Buoyed by this success,

Lords. The case was elaborately argued, and
publicised.
Once again, Thurlow and Wedderburn were opposed. Thurlow spoke in reply on 9
February 1774:
If one court’s determination in favour of the common law rights had given
three guineas for such a work as Hawkeworth’s
Voyages, what would not a
determination of the House of Lords give? Six guineas at least, so that the
public would be materially
injured if the monopoly contended for by the
respondent was ratified and confirmed. That it was a monopoly tending to
distress the
public, injure literature and contrary to every spring of natural

existed, upon publication it was abrogated by the statutory

Statute of Anne.

Thurlow spoke against the Bill, and returned to his theme:

they had purchased copyright from Homer down to Hawkesworth’s
Voyages, which he said was very low indeed, that Hawkesworth’s
book, which
was a mere composition of trash, sold for three guineas by their monopolizing;
and above that the booksellers were highly
censurable for not having taken
counsel’s opinion whether they had a right in copies or not, and not to
rely solely upon the

months, so that it lapsed on 22 June when Parliament was

, but a statutory
monopoly for a mere 28 years.
IV Strahan v Newbery
Even during the statutory period, Strahan had to fend off other
infringers.
As early as 31 July
1773 - less than two months after the appearance of Hawkesworth and Parkinson
– Newbery was selling a compilation
in 48 weekly parts of
the English circumnavigators, with Parkinson and Bougainville thrown in for good
measure, for fourpence halfpenny a
Just as the greater part
(two of the three volumes) of Hawkesworth was Cook’s first voyage, so too
the greater part of Newbery’s
compilation was to be Cook (most of the
third and fourth volumes of what was to be a four volume set). On any view of
the Statute
of Anne, Hawkesworth was protected, and so Newbery’s plan,
capitalising on the complaints of the high price and unnecessary
Hawkesworth, was to sell an abridgement.
On 11 November 1773, Wedderburn once again sought an
injunction from the Lord
Chancellor.
In accordance with
the usual practice, an injunction was granted until Newbery should fully answer
the Bill or further order. Newbery’s
answer is dated 12 January
and on 13 January Newbery
moved to dissolve the injunction, and an order
to that effect was

On 11 April 1774, the real issue came to be argued was Newbery’s work a
fair abridgement, or merely a colourable copy, of Hawkesworth?
The Statute of

abridgement, as opposed to
one which was merely colourable, did not

Master Harris’ report of 18 May 1774 does not appear to have been
However, the further
exception taken to it by Strahan on 30 May is
from which it is clear
that the Master found that Newbery was a

hand), ‘Heard November 1774’.
That is consistent with the record,
which provided for the exception and the balance of Strahan’s response to

Reports of cases adjudged in the Court of King’s

following report:
CURIA CANCELLARIA
Before Lord Chancellor Apsley, assisted by Mr Justice Blackstone
On a bill praying an injunction against an edition by Mr Newbery of an
abridgement of Dr Hawkesworth’s Voyages.
The Lord Chancellor was of opinion that this abridgement of the work was not any
violation of the author’s property whereon

That to constitute a true and proper abridgment of a work the whole must be

rendering it less expensive, and more convenient
both to the time and use of the
reader. Which made an abridgment in the nature of a new and a meritorious
That this had been done by Mr Newbery, whose edition might be read in the fourth
part of the time, and all the substance preserved,
and conveyed in language as
good or better than in the original, and in a more agreeable and useful manner.
That he had consulted
Mr Justice Blackstone, whose knowledge and skill in his
profession was universally known, and who as an author himself had done honour
to his country.
That they had spent some hours together, and were agreed that an abridgement,
where the understanding is employed in retrenching
unnecessary and uninteresting
circumstances, which rather deaden the narration, is not an act of plagiarism
upon the original work,
nor against any property of the author in it, but an
allowable and meritorious work. And that this abridgement of Mr Newbery’s
falls within the reasons and description.
Therefore the bill praying an injunction ought to be dismissed.
It is difficult to conceive that Lofft and his publisher Strahan were unaware
that the plaintiff in this decision, the publisher of
Hawkesworth’s famous
, was Strahan himself! The most likely explanation is that the
decision has been unnecessarily anonymized by the publisher’s
conceal his own loss.
V Conclusion
The reported reasons show that
Strahan v Newbery
was one of a handful
of generous decisions permitting abridgements of copyright works. Those
decisions came to be criticised –
both because the Lord Eldon’s
statement of principle in
Wilkins v Aiken
was merely ‘another mode
of stating the difficulty, rather than a test affording a clear criterion to
discriminate between the
and because it
seemed less clear that an abridger was a benefactor. The tenor of later
decisions was colourfully put by Wood V-C
(later Lord Hatherley) when he said
that he regarded the abridger ‘rather as a sort of jackall to the public,
to point out
the beauties of
Hawkesworth’s
and Parkinson’s
milestones in the publication of Pacific exploration, to which
Hawkesworth v
Strahan v Newbery
are small footnotes. The litigation
also yields insights into chancery practice in the late eighteenth century.
Moreover, although
not directly turning upon the larger question of the nature
of literary property, Hawkesworth’s
because of the
coincidence of its timing, its price and its quality, served as an effective
example of the issues at stake in the
curial and parliamentary development of
the law. As the debate concerning the recent extension of the copyright period

The appointment was
unexpected. Lord Eldon recorded that ‘de Grey LCJ gave a dinner to his
family and friends on account of
his being to have the Great Seal, as
Chancellor, next morning – but that in the Interim between the Dinner and
the next Morning,
Mr Justice Bathurst, it was determined, should be Chancellor
and received the Seal’ (

, Lincoln and McEwen (eds),
(1960) 108).

‘[A]dequate relief
could not be given by any action for damages, it being impossible to lay before
a jury the whole evidence
as to all the publications which go out to the world
to the plaintiff’s prejudice; and the sale of copies by the defendant
in such instance not only taking away the profit upon the individual book which
the plaintiff would have sold, but may injure
him to an incalculable extent,
which no inquiry into the extent of damages can ascertain’: Chitty, above

‘Where there has been
an infringement of Copyright; or where the Proprietors of a New invention under
Letter Patent, file
a Bill for an injunction to stay other persons from
infringing upon their Patent, the Court will grant an injunction on the filing
of the Bill, and before the Answer, on affidavit and certificate’:
A Treatise on the Principles and Practice of the High Court of
ed, 1820) vol 2, 217. ‘Immediately after the
bill has been filed, and upon
proper affidavits
, even before the defendant has been served with process on the bill or
knows of any proceeding, an injunction may, in cases requiring
interposition, be obtained, even within a very few hours after the cause of
proceeding has arisen. The cases in which the
Court usually interferes thus
summarily are those of irreparable waste, plain nuisance, infringement of a
clear copyright, forcible
entry, wasteful trespass, executors wasting assets,
and danger of a bill being unjustly negotiated’: Chitty, above n 16, vol

Chitty, above n 16, vol 1, 700. Indeed, until it was dismissed in
[1972] EWCA Civ 9
[1972] 2 QB 84
, 96-97, the notion that interlocutory injunctions were
especially readily granted in copyright suits continued to attract support.
In addition to the two
injunctions ordered in relation to Hawkesworth’s
this form, see eg
Potter v Chapman

Undertakings began to be
required in the 1840s:
Chappell v Davidson
(1856) 8 De M & G 1, 2
[1856] EngR 73
‘Has it not been for the last twelve or thirteen years an almost
universal practice to require, on granting an injunction,
an undertaking on the
part of the plaintiff, to be answerable in damages?’ per Knight Bruce LJ.
Thereafter, the registrars
were under instructions to insert the undertaking:

‘It appears not to be
the practice now so much as formerly to allow an injunction on an application
, but to grant what is denominated an
restraining the defendant until after a particular day stated in the
order’: Goldsmith,
The Doctrine and Practice of Equity

The Bill dated 26 January
1773 and Answer dated 11 May 1773 (tied together as was the custom) are large
pieces of parchment comprising
item 8 in PRO C12/1624. The affidavits are
C31/187 at folios 79 and 80. The best account of Chancery records at Kew and how
them is Horwitz,

The detail recorded
depended on the nature of the hearing and in part on the particular clerk
responsible. See for example
Burnett v Chetwood
, noted by Lord Eldon in
Southey v Sherwood

(1817) 2 Mer 435

In the Register’s
Book it was put thus: ‘with an Express Injunction that no other use but a
bare perusal thereof to

Parkinson died insane before

author of the preface: see the note by Dr Fothergill, 18 of the new edition of
Parkinson’s

the account in the preface reflecting what was decisive in court.

A further injunction (noted
Forms of Decrees Judgments and Orders
vol 1, 345) was issued in 1784 by Lord Thurlow in
Nicol v Kearsley
August 1884, B461) presumably to prevent publication by Kearsley of
compendious history of Captain Cook’s first and second voyages
1788, a 6th edition was published, so the injunction must either have been
dissolved or the litigation compromised.

The index of reports, PRO
IND 1/10700/15, does not list any reports from this litigation.
It may be found within PRO
C40/3, the bundle of 1774 exceptions. It stated: ‘First exception: For
that the Master hath certified
that the final fifteen numbers of the book
published by the defendant were taken from and contain the substance of the
of so much of the book published by the complainant as relates to the
description of the countries discovered the Latitude and Longitude
in which they
lie and the customs and manner of the natives thereof - with the most remarkable
occurrences that happened during the
said voyages but not in the same words or
phraseology. Whereas in fact the said final fifteen numbers were taken from and
the substance of nineteen parts in twenty at least of so much of the
book published by the complainant as abovementioned and are
in many places taken
in the same words and throughout in the same phraseology and the said Master
ought to have so found.’
Second exception: ‘For that the Master hath
reported that the said first fifteen numbers of the said book published by the
defendant (except a few pages therein which are taken from other books) is a
fair abridgement of the above mentioned book published
by the complainant
whereas he ought to have reported that the same is not a fair abridgement
PRO C33/442 folio 513 (14
June 1774).
PRO C33/442 folio 368 (5
August 1774). Newbery was permitted to publish the subsequent numbers of the
book (Parkinson and Bougainville)
in respect of which, of course, Strahan could
have no complaint.
[98 ER 913].
The bill was dismissed with
costs to be taxed on 5 July 1775: PRO C33/444 folio 575 (5 July 1775). This
order, made on the application
of defendant’s counsel, must have
post-dated the Chancellor’s decision.
