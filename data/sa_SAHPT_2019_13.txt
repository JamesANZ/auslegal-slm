Appellant: Mr M
Respondent: Mr C Jacobi
Solicitors:
Appellant: Ezra
Respondent: AHPRA
Introduction
appellant filed an appeal dated 16 November 2018 in the Tribunal on 20 November
2018. The appeal was in relation to a decision
made by the respondent on 5
October 2018 wherein the respondent imposed certain conditions on the appellant
while practising as a
physiotherapist. One of the conditions was that the
appellant was required to undertake breath alcohol testing as
more than 30 minutes prior to the commencement of each and every period of
practice, and
more than 30 minutes after the completion of each and every period of practice,
any time within the practice period as directed by the case officer or breath
test supervisor.
orders sought by the appellant included the granting of an extension of time in
which to bring the appeal. An appeal must be instituted
within 28 days after
notice of the decision being appealed against was given. The appellant also
sought that the conditions imposed
by the respondent be revoked or varied
pending determination of the appeal.
10 December 2018, the Tribunal ordered that the matter be listed for hearing in
relation to the revocation or variation of conditions
and the extension of time
in which to bring the appeal, such hearing to proceed on 1 February 2019 subject
to the convening of a
panel. The respondent was ordered to make disclosure by 11
January 2019, and a response was to be filed and served by 21 December
Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (South Australia) Act
(the National Law) provides that for the purposes of s 199 of the
National Law an appeal to the Tribunal must be instituted within
28 days after
the person making the appeal was given notice of the decision being appealed
against or the person making the appeal
was given reasons for the decision being
appealed against, whichever is the later. It is further provided that the
Tribunal may in
its discretion extend the time fixed for instituting the appeal
even if the time for instituting the appeal has ended.
The Hearing
appellant was represented by counsel, Mr Michael Fabbro, at the hearing seeking
an extension of time within which to bring the
appeal. The appellant filed a
written outline of submissions, as did the respondent, who opposed the extension
appellant retained his current solicitors Ezra Legal in September 2018. In an
email dated 21 September 2018 the appellant’s
solicitors wrote to Ms Cook
and Mr Sale at Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) advising
that Mr Michael Fabbro,
principal at Ezra Legal had been retained by the
appellant in respect of his registration and the investigation being undertaken
by the respondent.
final paragraph of the email of 21 September 2018 stated inter-alia “that
you direct future correspondence to this office
unless it is necessary and
appropriate for AHPRA to communicate directly with my client.”
Fabbro relied upon this part of the email to establish that the appellant may
not have become aware of the ‘Notice of Board
decision to take
action’ (Notice to take action) dated 5 October 2018 until some later date
given that the Notice to take action
was addressed to the appellant care of his
solicitors and not directly to him. In short, although Ezra Legal was informed
decision on 5 October 2018, the appellant was not informed on this
appellant has sought an extension of time within which to bring the appeal in
circumstances where it is open to him to assert
that the appeal has in fact been
brought in time. The respondent cannot in fact identify when the notice
provisions required by s
6A of the National Law were complied with. The
discretion vested in the Tribunal by s 6A(2) is unfettered. The delay in filing
appeal is short and certainly not in the order of three weeks as submitted
by the respondent.
appellant contended that the appeal has merit, and that the respondent has not
identified any prejudice should the extension of
time to appeal be granted.
appellant pointed out that the respondent was on notice by way of letter dated
24 October 2018 from Ezra Legal that the appellant
would be seeking to appeal
the decision of the board which again supports the position that the respondent
is not prejudiced.
then addressed the Tribunal regarding the revocation or variation of the
conditions imposed and suggested alternative conditions
to those imposed by the
respondent.
for the respondent commenced by indicating that the appellant as recently as
January 2018 was admitted to hospital for an
acute episode. The respondent
relied upon an addiction medicine report of Dr
which was initiated
following a report to AHPRA. This led to the conditions being imposed. Counsel
said usually an element of supervision
would be included but given that the
appellant works in private practice essentially on his own and employs a less
experienced junior
physiotherapist and a massage therapist there was not the
capacity for supervision.
noted that Ezra Legal had indicated in correspondence that it was acting on
behalf of the appellant. Counsel said it was not
necessary or required by the
National Law for there to be personal service upon the appellant and notice of
conditions can be effected
through a legal practitioner acting on the
appellant’s behalf, which was done here.
referred to a Federal Court decision of
Jess, M.P. v. Scott, R.T. &
at p 18 where reference was
made to a decision of the Privy Council:
As Lord Guest, speaking for the Privy Council, put it in
Ratnam v Cumarasamy
[1964] 3 All E.R. 933
‘The rules of court must, prima facie, be obeyed, and, in order to justify
a court in extending the time during which some
step in procedure requires to be
taken, there must be some material on which the court can exercise its
discretion. If the law were
otherwise, a party in breach would have an
unqualified right to an extension of time which would defeat the purpose of the
which is to provide a time table for the conduct of
litigation.’
submitted that there needs to be material put before the Tribunal to explain the
delay in instituting the appeal. The letter
of 24 October 2018 indicated that
Ezra Legal had instructions to
The appeal is not then
lodged until 20 November 2018. The delay is unexplained.
then referred to the fact that the appellant has the right of review of the
conditions which will occur on 5 April 2019. If
the respondent at that point
refuses to review or change the conditions the appellant would have a right of
appeal against that refusal.
Unlike many appeals once the extension of time is
refused that is the end of the matter, in this case there will be ongoing
made and all of them will be appealable.
Counsel also addressed the Tribunal as to appropriateness of the conditions.
Essentially the appellant contended that the conditions
are not a proportionate
response to the risk identified and sought a stay of the conditions until the
appeal is finally determined.
The respondent submitted that the conditions
imposed appropriately reflected the need to protect the public and to maintain
in the profession, and public confidence in it, by offering assurance
that in his present work setting (and in which the board allowed
continue) the appellant’s abstinence could be monitored.
Consideration - Order
Tribunal considered the application to extend the time in which to bring the
appeal. It was unanimous in its view that an extension
of time in which to
appeal would not be granted. The Tribunal was not satisfied that there was any
reasonable explanation as to the
delay. In the Tribunal’s view the notice
given to the appellant’s legal representatives was sufficient notice under
provisions of the National Law.
having reached this position although it was not necessary to do so the Tribunal
also considered whether it would be appropriate
to vary the conditions imposed.
The Tribunal did not consider it appropriate in any way to vary the conditions
imposed given the
content of the report of Dr Philip Crowley, Addiction
Medicine Specialist.
regards the question of costs the Tribunal is of the opinion that the respondent
should have its costs, such costs to be agreed
or adjudicated.
Tribunal made an order on 1 February 2019 ordering that the appellant’s
application to extend the time within which to institute
the appeal be refused
and also reserved the question of costs. That order, signed and sealed has been
circulated to the parties.
or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may
apply to this judgment.
The onus remains on any person using material in the judgment to ensure that the
intended use of that material
does not breach any such order or provision.
