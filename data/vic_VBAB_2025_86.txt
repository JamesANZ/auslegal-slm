issue that is the subject of this application to the Building Appeals Board
) concerns which version of the Building Code of Australia
) to adopt in respect of the energy efficiency requirements for the
Building Work.
Applicants have sought a certificate from the Respondent that, pursuant to
Building Act 1993
), BCA 2019 can be
adopted in respect of the energy efficiency requirements in Part H6 of the
National Construction Code, Volume 2
substantial progress had been made on the design of the building to which the

of the relevant provision in BCA
Applicants submit that the date that Part H6 of the NCC Vol 2 (
in the BCA 2022 ‘commenced’ was 1 May 2024, while the Respondent
submits that the relevant regulation ‘commenced’
on 1 May 2023. The
Respondent’s submissions are considered in more detail in our Findings
Respondent concedes that substantial progress had been made on the design of the
building the subject of the Building Work prior
to 1 May 2024, while it is
apparent that no progress had been made prior to 1 May 2023.
the issue for us to determine is what is the date on which Part H6 in the BCA
2022 commences.
dispute has been referred by the Applicants pursuant to s 157 of the
RELEVANT LEGISLATION
10(2) of the Act states:
(2) A building regulation, or an amendment to a building regulation or a binding
determination that applies to a building regulation,
does not apply to the
carrying out of building work if the relevant building surveyor is satisfied,
and certifies in writing, that
substantial progress was made on the design of
the building before the building regulation or amendment commenced or the
determination came into effect.
particular ‘building regulation’ or ‘amendment to a building
regulation’ that is the subject of this application
is Part H6. Part H6
forms part of the
Building Regulations 2018
Regulations
reason of reg 10 of the Regulations which adopts the BCA, and states that the
‘BCA forms part of [the] Regulations as modified
Regulations’. The definition of ‘BCA’ in the Regulations
states that it means the ‘Building Code
of Australia’, which in turn
is defined in the Act to mean the ‘Building Code of Australia
comprising’ volumes
1 and 2 of the National Construction Code, including
any Victorian variations or additions.
Immediately
after the ‘Introduction to Part H6 of NNCC Vol 2 in BCA 2022, there are
‘Notes’ which state:
From 1 May 2023 to 30 September
2023 Part 2.6 and Part 3.12 of NCC 2019 Volume Two Amendment 1 may apply instead
of Part H6 of NCC
2022 Volume Two. From 1 October 2023 Part H6 of NCC 2022
Volume Two applies.
regs 10A(2)(c) and (d) of the Regulations stated:
The BCA Volume Two
applies as if –
(c) in Part H6, in the Notes before the heading "Objectives", for "30 September
2023" there were substituted "30 April 2024";
(d) in Part H6, in the Notes before the heading "Objectives", for "1 October
2023" there were substituted "1 May 2024";
above note, together with the amendment to that note effected by regs 10A(2)(c)
and (d) of the Regulations, allows a transition
period for Part H6 in the BCA
2022 to take effect, but that from 1 May 2024 it is mandatory in Victoria.
10A of the Regulations was revoked with effect from 1 May 2024 by reason of reg
10A(3) of the Regulations.
Respondent submits that:
in my view the only regulatory change
occurred on 1 May 2024 was the revocation of Regulation 10A. No new or amended
regulation came
into effect on that date, only the conclusion of a transitional
concession.
Respondent appears to submit that, notwithstanding that the effect of reg
10A(2)(d) of the Regulations was to give effect to Part
H6 of BCA 2022 in
Victoria from 1 May 2024, the effect of the reg 10A(2)(d) being revoked on that
day was that ‘there was no
new or amended regulation [that] came into
effect on that date’, and therefore that Part H6 commenced on 1 May
do not accept the Respondent’s submissions. The effect of reg 10A(2)(d)
was to make Part H6 of the BCA 2022 mandatory in
Victoria on 1 May 2024. We
therefore find that this is the date that it ‘commenced’ within the
meaning of s 10(2) of
the Act. The fact that reg 10A(2)(d) was revoked on the
date that Part H6 commenced has no bearing on its commencement.
as the parties agreed, we find that substantial progress was made on the design
of the building before commencement of Part
H6 of the BCA 2022 on 1 May
DATE OF DETERMINATION: 27 JUNE 2025
Clause 17 of Schedule 3 to the
Building Act 1993
provides: ‘Unless the Building Appeals Board
otherwise determines, a party to a proceeding before the Board must bear his,
or its own costs’.
