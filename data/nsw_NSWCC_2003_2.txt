CASE NUMBER: 43988 of 1999 of 2003.00
WORDS: Elements of Workers Compensation
LEGISLATION CITED:
CORAM: Armitage J
DATES OF HEARING: 18/02/03
TEMPORE DATE: 18/02/2003
LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES
APPLICANT:Mr D M Egan, solicitor appeared for the respondent/applicant.
RESPONDENT:Mr M C Fordham instructed by Sparke Helmore appeared for the
claimant/respondent.
1. This is a Motion seeking that a “
Registrar in issuing a certificate pursuant to
Compensation
Court Act 1984
on 19 August 2002 be reconsidered by the Court pursuant to
subrule 2(1) of the
Compensation Court Rules 1990
. In fact the prayer in the
Notice of Motion filed on 3 December 2002 is incorrectly expressed, but Mr
Fordham, who appears for the
claimant on the Motion, the respondent to the
original proceedings, confirms that my understanding of what his client seeks is
It seeks that I order that no interest be payable on the costs ordered
by this Court with the consent of the parties on 4 February
2002 or in the
alternative, that interest only be payable from 25 February 2002 until 25 March
2002, and thus that the certificate
be varied to reflect whichever of those
orders the Court might think appropriate.
2. The Motion was supported by an affidavit filed in this Court and sworn by
Colin Bruce Pausey, the solicitor for the respondent/claimant,
on 3 December
2002, but that also annexes a further affidavit filed in the District Court and
sworn by Mr Pausey on 12 November 2002.
That affidavit was filed in the
District Court in support of a Motion for a stay on a judgment of that Court,
entered as a result
of the filing therein of a certificate of the award of this
Court in relation to costs in these proceedings.
3. I do not propose to go through a full chronology as it is well known to
the parties and there are only certain parts of it that
are particularly germane
to the decision I propose. The original application before me was hard fought
and proceeded over many days.
My original award was made on 23 December 1998 on
the handing down of a reserved judgment by me in favour of the applicant, the
respondent to the Motion, Colleen Thelma Allen against the respondent, the
claimant on the Motion, The State of New South Wales in
right of the New South
Wales Department of Agriculture, if I may so put it. I made the usual costs
order in favour of the successful
applicant at that time. An appeal was
subsequently heard in the Court of Appeal against my judgment and award, and on
13 July 2000
that appeal was dismissed.
4. On 27 December 2000 an assessment of costs was forwarded by the
applicant/respondent’s solicitors to the respondent/claimant’s
solicitors. The costs were determined by a costs assessor’s certificate
on 11 September 2001 in a particular sum. The applicant/respondent
appealed to
this Court under the powers given in the
Legal Profession Act
to this Court
against that costs assessment, and eventually on 4 February 2002 a consent order
was entered in this Court, setting
aside the costs assessor’s
determination and determining the applicant’s costs in a sum of
5. This brought into play s 110 of the Workplace Injury Management &
Workers Compensation Act 1998 (“the WIM Act”),
which provides in
subsection (3) that no interest is payable on any sum ordered to be paid,
provided the sum is paid in full within
21 days after it becomes payable. It is
made clear by
Dyktynski v BHP Titanium Minerals Pty Limited
[2001] NSWCA 54
that the section confers a non-discretionary right to interest unless,
in the opening words of subsection (1), “the Commission
orders in any
particular case that interest be not payable”. The parties agree (for
reasons which are sound but which, in
view of the parties’ agreement, do
not require analysis) that the word “Commission” where appearing in
the section
refers in the current context to this Court.
6. This means that there is in the section a prima facie right to interest,
as Mr Fordham for the respondent recognises, from the
date of my original costs
order in this Court, which was made at the time of my original award on 23
December 1998, to the date of
payment of those costs. Mr Fordham concedes that
it is necessary for him to satisfy me that I should order otherwise in this
His Motion, as he eventually recognised, is properly characterised,
although the Motion does not say so, as an application for review
of the act of
the Registrar in issuing a certificate reflecting the Consent Order dated 4
February 2002 which determined costs in
the sum of $230,000, and ordered payment
of interest from the date of my original costs order, by varying the certificate
by inserting
a different order as to interest. That certificate was issued on
19 August 2002, which is not an unimportant matter in the scheme
of things in my
7. It is clear that the words “or does any other act” in
Compensation Court Act 1984
(which by common consent applies to this
Motion) refer to the issue of the certificate. Certainly it is not a
within the subsection, but the “or” in the
subsection in my view is disjunctive, so as to allow the review of “any
other act” by a registrar (such as the issue of a certificate in the above
circumstances) which is not a “decision”.
8. Nevertheless, Mr Egan for the respondent/applicant rightly makes the point
that because my order for costs in 1998 carried with
it a right to interest
under s 110 of the WIM Act, unless at the time I ordered otherwise under
subsection (1), this application
seeks by necessary implication that I also
reconsider that order by ordering otherwise now in relation to interest as
empowered by
s 110(1). This in turn brings into play, as Mr Egan rightly
submits, Pt 27 r 2 of the
Compensation Court Rules
. He draws attention in
particular to subrule (2) of rule 2 reading:
An application mentioned in subrule (1) shall be made as soon as practicable
after the person making the application becomes aware
of any ground on which it
is made, and before the person, if he is a party to the proceedings, takes any
fresh step in the proceedings
after becoming so aware.
9. He draws attention also to r 2 subrule (3), which relevantly reads:
An application mentioned in subrule (1) shall be supported by an affidavit or
affidavits containing and verifying a statement as to
. . . (f) any steps taken
in the proceedings by the person making the application after a fact, matter or
thing mentioned in paragraph
(e) became known to him, and the respective dates
upon which any such steps were taken.
10. Certainly Mr Pausey’s affidavits comply with the Rules in this
respect but they disclose a somewhat calamitous state of
affairs, with respect.
This is because Mr Egan’s assessment of costs was submitted by him as
solicitor for the applicant/respondent
on 27 September 2000 to Mr Pausey as
solicitor for the respondent/claimant and after considerable action on the part
of both parties,
consent orders were made settling the appeal to this Court from
the costs assessor’s decision on 4 February 2002, and on 11
March 2002, Mr
Egan wrote to the claimant/respondent’s solicitors noting non-payment of
costs within 21 days under s 110(3)
referred to above and claiming interest, and
all that then occurred was a letter from Mr Pausey as solicitor for the
respondent/claimant
on 22 March 2002, simply enclosing a cheque for $230,000 in
payment of costs but making no response whatever to Mr Egan’s demand
11. Not surprisingly, Mr Egan wrote a letter of 11 April 2002, according to
the respondent’s chronology filed in Court today
by consent, quantifying
the interest he sought. No satisfactory response was received to that, so Mr
Egan made application for a
certificate from the Compensation Court of the
judgment of this Court on the question of costs pursuant to
Compensation Court Act
, and that certificate issued on 19 August 2002, and was
served on the respondent’s solicitors on 28 August 2002.
12. On 11 October 2002, a sealed copy of a certificate of the District Court
obtained by Mr Egan pursuant to the District Court Act
and Rules was served on
the respondent/claimant’s solicitors, and it was only then that they
“swung into action”,
as Mr Fordham eloquently put it, and
sought a stay from the District Court. This was, I gather, granted on terms
that this Motion
be heard before me to decide eventually the
applicant/respondent’s right to interest, hence the proceedings before me
13. Large slabs of delay, if I may so put it, are evident from that
chronology on the part of the claimant/respondent’s solicitors.
did they fail to pay the $230,000 they had agreed upon on behalf of their client
within time as a result of administrative
error, as set out in Mr Pausey’s
affidavit filed in the District Court, which may perhaps be excused as
inadvertence, but in
breach of pt 27 r. 2 subrule (2) above mentioned, they
failed to take any action to have the right to interest contained in s 110(3)
the WIM Act varied until this Motion was eventually filed on 3 December 2002.
Meanwhile, the right to interest had been accruing
for many months. All of
these matters would appear to be proper factors to consider when deciding
whether to exercise the discretion
in s 110(1).
14. With due respect to the pertinacious, vigorous and well argued
submissions of Mr Fordham for the respondent, I can see no proper
which I should exercise the discretion conferred by the opening words of s 110
and give the respondent/claimant relief
from the operation of subsection (3) of
the section.
15. The Motion is refused and the claimant/respondent must pay the
respondent/applicant’s costs.
Mr D M Egan (solicitor) appeared for the
respondent/applicant.
Mr M C Fordham instructed by Sparke Helmore appeared
for the claimant/respondent.
