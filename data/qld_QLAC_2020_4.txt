APPEARANCES:
SW Trewavas (instructed by Marland Law) for the appellant
R Cunningham (solicitor), Taylors Solicitors, for the respondent
[1] THE COURT:
On 4 June 2019 Member Stilgoe made a determination, under
Mineral Resources Act 1989
(MRA), for compensation payable for the
renewal of a mining lease.
respondents in the Land Court matter, Patrick and Prue Lonergan, appealed Member
Stilgoe’s determination to the Land Appeal
The appeal was unsuccessful.
[2] The parties, having been unable able to reach agreement as to costs, have
filed submissions with regard to costs in both the
appeal and, as no cost order
was made, the hearing at first instance.
[3] Section 57A of the
Land Court Act 2000
(LCA) provides:
(1) The Land Appeal Court may order costs for an appeal to the court as it
considers appropriate.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), the Land Appeal Court may order costs
for the proceeding in which the decision appealed against
was made, whether or
not the court or tribunal that made the decision made, or had power to make, an
order for costs for the proceeding.
(3) If the Land Appeal Court does not make an order under subsection (1),
each party to the appeal must bear the party’s own
costs for the appeal.
(4) This section is subject to the provision of this Act or another Act to
the contrary.
[4] Furthermore, s 282(5) of the MRA confers a near analogous power on the Court
to “make such orders as to costs of the appeal
as it thinks fit”. As
such s 57A(4) of the LCA is not enlivened.
Appeal Costs
[5] The respondent seeks an order that the appellant pay the respondents costs
of the appeal on an indemnity basis, or, in the alternative,
a standard basis.
[6] Generally speaking, “costs follow the event in the usual way”,
as the Land Appeal Court said in
Mentech Resources Pty Ltd v MCG Resources
Pty Ltd (In Liq) (No.
Land Appeal Court may order costs ‘as it considers appropriate’. The
discretion to award costs is unfettered.
However the rule often followed, and
the rule incorporated in r 689 of the
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999
that costs follow the event. That rule, while it does not govern the exercise of
the discretion here, nonetheless informs it,
as there is justice in that
approach. It protects those put to unnecessary and substantial expense at the
behest of others. There
is no reason here why costs should not follow the event
in the usual way.
[7] Mentech
has been applied by the Land Appeal Court in several cases
Mio Art v Brisbane City
ERO Georgetown
Gold Operations Pty Ltd v Henry (No
¸ the Land Appeal Court said:
not accord pre-eminence to the rule that the costs follow the event, in contrast
to r 681 of the UCPR, equally, it does not
create a general rule that parties
bear their own costs. When an application is made for costs under it, the Court
is required to
determine what order (if any) is appropriate. In carrying out
that task, the Court is to have regard to established principles relating
exercise of such a discretion, to the extent they are relevant to the facts of
the case before the Court. One such principle
is the “rule often
followed” that costs follow the event. The passage quoted from the
judgment of McHugh J in Latoudis
is also relevant. It follows that a
party’s success will often be a significant, though not necessarily
decisive, factor in
its application for an order for costs.
[8] The appellant submits that, “at the highest”, the
respondent’s claim for costs would be half the costs of the
assessed on a standard basis only. The appellant submits this on the basis that
the Land Appeal Court considered an application
on behalf of the respondent (the
preliminary issue) which had taken up “nearly 50% of the hearing and
“almost half the
appeal judgment”, and that while unsuccessful, the
grounds of appeal do not rise to a level of unreasonableness.
the Land Appeal Court said:
In reaching
a decision in this matter, the court is mindful of the fact that the specific
provisions of s.34(1) of the Act apply
rather than the UCPR. It is clearly open
to this court to reach a decision on costs on the principles as outlined by
Toohey J in
. However, this court is aware of the words of caution
expressed by Toohey J:
“There is no difficulty in stating the principles; their application to
the facts of a particular case is not always easy. Also
it is necessary to keep
in mind the caveat by Jacobs J. in Cretazzo v. Lombardi at 16. His Honour
sounded what he described as ‘a
note of cautious disapproval’ of
applications to apportion costs according to the success or failure of one party
or the other
on the various issues of fact or law which arise in the course of a
trial. His Honour commented:
“But trials occur daily in which the party, who in the end is wholly or
substantially successful, nevertheless fails along the
way on particular issues
of fact or law. The ultimate ends of justice may not be served if a party is
dissuaded by the risk of costs
from canvassing all issues, however doubtful,
which might be material to the decision of the case. There are, of course, many
affecting the exercise of the discretion as to costs in each case,
including in particular, the severability of the issues, and no
two cases are
alike. I wish merely to lend no encouragement to any suggestion that a party
against whom the judgment goes ought nevertheless
to anticipate a favourable
exercise of the judicial discretion as to costs in respect of issues upon which
he may have succeeded,
based merely on his success in those particular
issues.”” (footnotes omitted)
[10] The Court does not accept the appellant’s submission that the hearing
and judgment were equally occupied by the Appeal
itself and the application to
dismiss. The hearing predominantly dealt with the nine grounds of appeal, as did
both parties oral
and written submissions. As a result of that, in fact,
concomitant of it, the appeal judgment also predominately dealt with the grounds
of appeal. The respondent raised only one issue in the argument concerning the
preliminary issue
and made numerous
concessions.
The operation of s
282A(6) of the MRA had not been considered judicially
and the parties
submissions regarding the issue were not comprehensive. Accordingly, this is not
a case where it is appropriate to
apportion costs.
[11] With regard to awarding costs on an indemnity basis, the Court of Appeal
Kendell v Kendell & Ors
This Court has the
power to make an order it considers appropriate concerning the costs of an
appeal. Despite the existence this wide
power, the Court will usually only award
costs on the standard basis unless it is of the view that the conduct of the
appeal by a
party has been ‘plainly unreasonable’ or there are other
‘special or unusual features justifying a departure from
In my respectful opinion, an order of costs on the indemnity basis is
appropriate in this case. The principal contention advanced
by the appellant
before this Court, and which was the focus of attention at the hearing of the
appeal, related to an issue which
had not been litigated below and which was not
available to be raised for the first time on appeal. The assurance of freedom
personal liability that the appellant claimed to seek by way of an order
from this Court had never been sought in clear terms by
him and, most
importantly, was not sought by him between the decision at first instance and
the hearing of the appeal. The appellant's
conduct was, in my view, so
unreasonable as to require him to be ordered to pay costs on the indemnity
[12] In the present case the respondent argues that as the appellants were
unsuccessful on all grounds, they have acted unreasonably
as it “should
have been clear that their appeal had no prospects of success”.
Relevantly, the respondent points out that
the appellant did not adduce any
additional evidence for the appeal, despite a lack of evidence being referred to
multiple times
in the decision of Member
[13] As set out above, in
unreasonableness
was established against the appellant by advancing a principal contention upon
appeal which was not raised before
the primary judge. That example of
unreasonableness does not arise in the present case. Before the Land Court, the
respondent argued
for compensation in the sum of
$64,696.80.
Despite a three-day
hearing, including a visit to the mine site, the learned member quantified
compensation at $3,726.38 together
with an obligation to pay 10% of any annual
invoice for track grading.
[14] As set out in this court’s
the learned member
undertook her role in assessing compensation carefully, rationally and in
accordance with the legislation. Despite
this, the appeal was lodged on
26 October 2019 seeking the same amount of compensation as originally
sought: $64,696.80, quantified
in precisely the same manner as sought before the
learned member.
That is, the
appellant argued that the learned member had assessed compensation incorrectly
by a factor of 17.
appellant, in essence, argued that the learned member was wrong in every
respect, but as has been shown in the Appeal judgment,
the learned member was
right in all respects, bar a mathematical error which was in the
appellant’s favour. As this Court reflected,
the mathematical error
pointed out by the appellant could only lead to the conclusion that the learned
member’s compensation
valuation was “too
AAI Limited v
the Court of
Appeal reinforced the notion that a successful party, particularly an
“impecunious litigant”, should not
be left “out of
pocket” by the impact of a standard costs
It must be reiterated
that the mining lease was for a small, family-operated gold surface mine in the
rough terrain.
[16] As demonstrated by the learned member’s judgment in the first
instance and, in particular, on appeal, the claim advanced
by the appellant was
for an exaggerated sum. One example of this is the appellant’s claim for
management time, particularised
both in the hearing at first instance and on
appeal, as “negotiations with the applicants regarding compensation - ten
at $150 per hour”. The learned member dealt with this in her
Mr Lonergan was vague in identifying the time
spent with Mr Friese trying to negotiate compensation. At best, it seems
there is only
one meeting. I do not accept that this meeting justifies a claim
for 10 hours spent in negotiations. The bulk of the time claim appears
time Lonergan spent preparing for the hearing. The time spent preparing for the
hearing cannot be the subject of
compensation.
As the primary judgment and appeal judgment shows, each of the claimed heads
of compensation was demonstrably inflated. The conduct
of the appellant in
advancing, at first instance and on appeal, a claim for compensation which was
exaggerated or demonstrably inflated,
constitutes conduct which is plainly
unreasonable, thus warranting an indemnity order as to costs.
[17] Accordingly, the appellant ought to pay the respondent’s costs of and
incidental to the appeal assessed on an indemnity
Hearing at first instance
[18] Section 34 of the LCA provides:
(1) Subject to the provisions of this or another
Act to the contrary, the Land Court may order costs for a proceeding in the
as it considers appropriate.
(2) If the court does not make an order under subsection (1), each party to
the proceeding must bear the party’s own costs
for the proceeding.
The Land Court did not make an order for costs. Section 34(2) of the LCA is
engaged and the position is that each party to the proceeding
must bear their
own costs for the proceeding.
[19] It is submitted by the respondents (applicants at first instance) that
given the disparity between the amount claimed by the
appellants (respondent at
first instance) and what was awarded by the Land Court, some $60,000, that the
respondent was “successful”
and as such “costs should follow
the event”.
[20] Alternatively, the appellant submits that the amount awarded by the Land
Court was “three times” the amount proposed
by the respondent, plus
the 10% allowance for track maintenance. However, with the total compensation
awarded being $3,726.38, an
increase of 300% is relatively insignificant; an
increase from $100 to $200 would be a 200% increase but is hardly substantial.
[21] Furthermore, the appellant points out that prior to the respondent filing
with the Land Court the parties only conducted one
meeting to negotiate
compensation. The respondent argues that as the appellant was claiming such a
large amount further negotiation
would have been fruitless. By its conduct of
the appeal in claiming exaggerated amounts for each and every head of damage
it may be demonstrated, in retrospect, that the respondent was correct
that further negotiation would have been fruitless. The difficulty
with such an
affirmative conclusion is that there is a dearth of evidence as to what in fact
occurred regarding any attempt to reach
an agreement as to compensation.
[22] As the learned member reflected, it appeared there was only one meeting
concerning an attempt to negotiate
compensation.
Despite both
parties having the opportunity to provide evidence upon the issue of costs, no
party provided any evidence as to what
occurred during that one meeting, nor any
other evidence concerning negotiations or offers to properly settle the amount
of compensation.
The success or otherwise of the parties’ positions must
be judged according to the only available evidence.
[23] The only available evidence is that the respondent’s position at the
conclusion of the primary trial was for a rate of
$150 per annum for the ten
That is, a submission
that appropriate compensation is approximately $1,500 (on a non-discounted
basis), whereas the respondent’s
position at trial was that it sought
compensation of $64,696.80.
the absence of evidence as to what offers were made at any time prior to the
learned member’s determination of compensation,
it must be concluded that
no party succeeded, in the sense that neither party beat its own offer.
[24] The determination made by the Land Court under s 281(1) of the MRA
enlivens in the Land Court a general discretion as to costs
at the conclusion of
a proceeding pursuant to s 34 of the LCA. The MRA supports a cooperative
approach between the parties to agree
the amount of
compensation.
Importantly,
s 36 of the LCA allows for the arrangement of a preliminary conference to
“discuss the issues in dispute and attempt
to negotiate a
settlement” and s 37 of the LCA applies the alternate dispute
resolutions (“ADR”) provisions of
Civil Proceedings Act
to the Land Court. Furthermore, by r 4 of the
(LCR), the rules in the
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules
(UCPR) apply. This, in turn, engages Chapter 9 Part 5 of the
UCPR allowing formal offers to settle.
[25] In summary therefore, the MRA encourages negotiation by the parties to
reach an agreement with respect to compensation, failing
which either party can
apply to the Land Court for a determination under s 281. Or, if
compensation was not agreed between them within
3 months after the current term
of the lease ended, the chief executive was required to refer the issue of
compensation to the Land
Court for its
determination.
[26] Under the LCA there is opportunity for a preliminary conference chaired by
a Land Court member or judicial registrar to attempt
to reach an agreement as to
compensation and an ADR process such as mediation or case appraisal. The LCR
further engage the UCPR
which allow formal offers to settle to be made. The
parties may also make offers to settle at common law pursuant to the principles
Calderbank v
successful parties may receive an order for indemnity costs on this
[27] In this case, neither party applied for a determination. The chief
executive referred the question of the amount of compensation
to be paid by the
miner to the Land Court for determination. Neither party occupies the position
of plaintiff or defendant as they
would in ordinary civil litigation.
Accordingly, in the absence of evidence of offers to settle it cannot be
concluded whether either
party was “successful”. Furthermore,
s 34 of the LCA, in recognition of this, invests the Land Court with a
broad discretion
as to the appropriate costs order and provides the default
position in an absence of an order, each party to the proceedings bear
Mio Art Pty Ltd & Ors v Brisbane City
President MacDonald
The effect of s.34(1) of the Land Court Act and s.27(1)
of the Acquisition of Land Act is that the Land Court has a complete discretion
as to the award of costs, subject only to s.27(2) of the Act. The discretion is
to be exercised judicially, that is, for reasons
that 5 can be considered and
justified. There are a number of factors that are relevant to the exercise of
that discretion.
One factor is that
‘Compulsory acquisition cases differ from ordinary claims in the
significant respect that the claimant, unlike the ordinary
plaintiff, has no
choice whether to make a claim or not. The mere acquisition by compulsory
process gave the claimant a claim to
compensation which he or she could hardly
be expected to renounce.’
Banno v The Commonwealth
Wilcox J said –
‘... The acquisition left the applicants in the position of either
accepting the Commonwealth’s assessment of the proper
compensation or of
having the Court rule on its adequacy. Perhaps people in that position should be
allowed access to the Court,
to present an arguable and well organised case,
without being deterred by the prospect of being ordered to pay the
Commonwealth’s
costs if their case proves unpersuasive. I distinguish the
situation of resumees who pursue a vexatious, dishonest or grossly exaggerated
claim or present their case in such a way as to impose unnecessary burdens on
the Commonwealth or the Court.’
Similarly, in
Pastrello v Roads and Traffic Authority (NSW)
‘There needs to be a strong justification for awarding costs against
an applicant where the effect of making that order is
to erode the benefit of
the just compensation recovered as a consequence of the Court's determination.
It is only in special cases
that the Court will deprive the owner of the full
benefit of the compensation which is determined as fair and just in the
circumstances
of the case.’
Another factor to be considered is the quantum of the claims as compared
with the amount of the Court's determination. The Council
has submitted that the
claims were exorbitant and that the effect of the exorbitant claims was that the
Council was forced erroneously
and unnecessarily into a lengthy and complex two
week trial. (footnotes omitted)
[29] As already observed, neither party occupies the position of plaintiff or
defendant as they would in ordinary civil litigation.
Accordingly, the
principles in
are not completely pertinent but one factor that
may be taken into account is the reasonableness or, lack thereof, in attempting
to reach an agreement as to the amount of compensation. The discretion to award
costs under s 34 of the LCA is broad and does not
create a “general
rule that parties bear their own
However, in
accordance with orthodox principle, costs orders ought not be made unless the
party seeking the costs order demonstrates
it has been “successful”
so as to engage the ordinary rule that costs follow the event.
[30] While the amount of compensation awarded by the Land Court was much closer
to the amount proposed by the respondent, the Court
was not convinced that they
were “successful” and that “cost should follow the
[31] The learned member at first instance would have no doubt been aware of the
operation of s 34(2) of the LCA, that is, where no
order as to costs is made,
parties are to bear their own costs. Confirming the learned members approach,
with regard to the hearing
at first instance, the parties are to bear their own
