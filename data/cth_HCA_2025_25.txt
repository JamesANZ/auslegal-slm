a proceeding commenced in the original jurisdiction of the High Court on 3
September 2024, the plaintiffs (who had been the Divisional
Branch Secretary and
Divisional Branch Assistant Secretary of the Construction and General
Queensland-Northern Territory Divisional
Branch of the CFMEU until removed from
those offices on 23 August 2024 as a result of the Scheme) sought declaratory
and injunctive

Commonwealth parties") as well as the Administrator on grounds which

of Ch 11 of the
the Scheme. The grounds of asserted invalidity came to be reflected in questions
of law which the parties agreed in stating
for the opinion of the Full Court by
a special case filed in the proceeding on 18 October 2024. The special case was
argued before
the Full Court on 10 and 11 December 2024 when the
Attorneys‑General of South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland intervened

questions stated in the special case are set out in the reasons for judgment of
Gordon J. I agree with the answers to those questions
proposed by her
Honour, the overall effect of which is that
of Ch 11 of the
the Scheme are not invalid on any of the asserted grounds of constitutional
invalidity.
to the reasons for those answers, I agree with the reasons expressed by
Jagot J for the answer to the effect that
of Ch 11 of the
does not infringe Ch III of the
Constitution
and also with the reasons expressed
by Gordon J for the answer to the effect that
of Ch 11 of the

preference is to state my own reasons for the answers to the effect that
is properly characterised as a law with respect to constitutional corporations
within the meaning of
Constitution
and to the effect that
nor the Scheme impermissibly burdens the implied freedom of
political communication.
Characterisation
plaintiffs did not contest the propositions stated by the majority in
South Wales v The Commonwealth (Work Choices
context of upholding the validity of the predecessor to the
that the power
conferred on the Parliament by
Constitution
to make laws with
respect to constitutional corporations extends to prescribing "the means by
which [constitutional corporations
and their employees] are to conduct their
industrial relations", including by providing for the registration of employer
and employee
organisations and by requiring "as a condition of registration,
that these organisations meet requirements of efficient and democratic
of their affairs".
plaintiffs accordingly embraced the validity of
pursuant to which the Federal Court of Australia is empowered on application
to make a declaration that a branch of a registered organisation
"has ceased to
exist or function effectively and there are no effective means under the rules
of the organisation or branch by which
it can be reconstituted or enabled to
function effectively"
then to make an order approving a scheme for the taking of action "for the
reconstitution of the branch" or "to enable the branch
... to function
effectively".
plaintiffs contrasted the objectivity and generality of the criterion of a
branch having "ceased to ... function effectively"
for the triggering of a
scheme under
with the criterion of satisfaction that
it is in the "public interest" that the Construction and General Division of the
its branches alone be placed under administration by reference to
which the responsible Minister is empowered to determine a scheme

Construction and General Division of the CFMEU and each
of its branches under

observance of the constraint is an institutional imperative was explained by
Brennan J in
Trident General Insurance Co Ltd v McNiece Bros Pty
The foundational
conception is that the function of declaring the law is vested in the Court
rather than in the Justices who from
time to time comprise the Court. Building
on that foundation, the discipline that "a decision of the Court will be
followed in subsequent
cases by the Court, however composed, subject to the
exceptional power which resides in the Court to permit reconsideration",
with the institutional constraint on the exercise of that exceptional
power of the Court to reopen and re-examine its own decisions,
"provides the
appropriate balance between a legal system on which the dead hand of the past
rests too heavily and one in which the
law is in continual ferment".
an impugned law infringes the implied freedom of political communication turns
on the result of an orthodox and familiar
inquiry established by the Court in
and refined by the Court differently comprised in subsequent cases,
the most significant of them being
New South Wales
inquiry is as to: whether the law effectively burdens freedom of political
communication in its legal or practical operation;
if so, whether its purpose is
legitimate in the sense of being compatible with the maintenance of the
constitutionally prescribed
system of representative government; and, if so,
whether it is reasonably appropriate and adapted to advance that purpose in a
that is compatible with maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed
system of representative government.
the breadth of the concepts employed, nor the lack of unanimity amongst members
of the Court in and after
as to whether and when the third stage
is or might usefully be informed by subsidiary concepts of "suitability",
"necessity" and
"adequacy of balance", detracts from the orthodoxy of that
inquiry or relieves the judicial duty to undertake so much of it as is
to determine legal rights in issue in a particular case.
differences as to how the third stage of the inquiry is best undertaken cannot
undermine the common ground upon which
those differences have emerged –
that the inquiry must be undertaken. Notably, as recently remarked on in
Babet v The
Commonwealth
emergence of those differences was anticipated in
there noted that "[d]ifferent formulae [had] been used by members of this Court
in other cases to express the test whether
the freedom provided by the
Constitution
has been infringed" in that "[s]ome judges [had] expressed the test
as whether the law is reasonably appropriate and adapted to the
fulfilment of a
legitimate purpose" and that "[o]thers [had] favoured different expressions,
including proportionality". Importantly,
the Court recorded that, in the context
of the issues in that case, prime amongst which was whether the existence of the
freedom should continue to be recognised, "there [was] no need to
distinguish these concepts".
now to undertake the inquiry in the present case, contrary to an argument of the
Commonwealth parties, the inquiry cannot
be diverted from a consideration of
of Ch 11 of the
to a consideration only of the constitutionally
permissible scope of the

said time and again
to mean "nothing more complicated than that the effect of the law is to

Unions NSW v New South
rejecting an argument that "the availability of public funding and the existence
of expenditure caps" under the
Election Funding, Expenditure and Disclosures

donations imposed "no material burden" on the freedom. Those enhancements
political communication were said to be "beside the point". "Questions as to the
extent of the burden and whether it is proportionate
to the legitimate purpose

this point [being] simply whether the freedom is in
fact burdened".
circumstance that the restrictions on the time, place or method of engaging in
political communications in each of
Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v
The Commonwealth
Levy v Victoria
Monis v The Queen
found to impose burdens which required justification in order to be shown to be
compatible with the implied freedom illustrates
the observations made by
Nettle J in
does not follow that, just because restrictions on a particular form of
political communication leave those who are affected
free to pursue other forms
of political communication, the restrictions will not impose a burden on the
implied freedom of political
communication" and that "if a restriction on a
preferred mode of communication significantly compromises the ability of those
to communicate their message, it may not be an answer that they are
left free to communicate by other, less effective means". Those
observations are
pertinent here.
effective burden which
of Ch 11 of the
imposes on freedom of
political communication is a meaningful practical limitation on political
communication which arises from the
combination of two main features of its
legal operation. One is its automatic removal of officers of the Construction
and General
Division and conferral of the functions and powers that those
officers would have in the absence of administration, as well as the
and powers of the Construction and General Division and its branches, on the
Administrator. The other is its automatic
vesting in the Administrator of powers
of control, management and disposition of property of the CFMEU previously used
predominantly for the purposes of the Construction and General
Division or any of its branches.
resultant practical limitation on political communication has at least three
dimensions. The first is the deprivation of the
capacity of the CFMEU, as a body
corporate, to deploy its own property for the purposes of political
communication in pursuit of
its political objects in accordance with the rules
of the Construction and General Division. The second is the impediment of the
capacity of members of the Construction and General Division to engage in
collective political communication, and to pool and deploy
property for the
purpose of political communication, through the vehicle of the Construction and
General Division and in accordance
with its rules. The third is the restricted
capacity for donations to political parties attributable to the requirement for
the Administrator
now to be satisfied that such a donation would be in the best
interests of members in order for the donation to be made.
significance of each of those dimensions of the resultant practical limitation
on political communication lies in its effect
on "the freedom
generally",
say, on "the free flow of political communication within the
federation",
mind that the freedom protected is not merely to disseminate but also to receive
information which might ultimately bear
on electoral
In respect of the
second dimension, that effect stems from a curtailment of the effectiveness of
individuals being able to associate
for political purposes which has been
recognised as "part and parcel of the protected

emphasises.
In respect of
the third, that effect stems from the restriction on a source of funds
historically available to political parties
to meet the cost of political
communication.
the Commonwealth parties did not deny the existence of a burden. The thrust of
their argument was that any burden was
both "slight and incidental to the
pursuit of a purpose unrelated to restricting political communication" and was
therefore "readily
justified".
"purpose" of a law in this and other constitutional contexts, as I have
explained in the past, equates to the "end" or "object"
The purpose is the
"public interest sought to be protected and enhanced" by the
Most often, as here,
the purpose can be described in terms of what "the law is designed to achieve in
which is the
inverse of "the mischief" at which the law is
features of that generic constitutional conception of the purpose of a law need
to be highlighted.
first is the most fundamental. The judicial ascertainment and attribution of the
purpose to a law, no less than the judicial
ascertainment and attribution of a
meaning to the same law, is "an expression of the constitutional relationship
between the arms
of government with respect to the making, interpretation and
application of laws".
Each "is an exercise in attributing an objective intention to the outcome of a
legislative process".
Purpose, like meaning, is to be "ascertained objectively" from the "whole text
and context".
difference is that, because ascertainment of the purpose of a law is not
directed to the meaning of the enacted text but to why
that text was enacted,
ascertainment of the purpose of a law can be informed by the enacted text but
can never be confined to or
by the enacted
second is that a law can have more than one purpose and that an ascertained and
attributed purpose of a given law can often be
expressed at more than one level
of generality or specificity. The level appropriate for judicial expression of a
particular purpose
in a particular case will "depend on what constitutional
analysis is being undertaken", which will in turn "depend on what constitutional
doctrine is in play and ultimately on what constitutional value is at
The third is that the context within which the purpose of a law is to be
ascertained can be no narrower than the context within
which the meaning of that
same law falls to be ascertained. That context includes the entirety of the
parliamentary proceedings which
resulted in the enactment of the law. For the
most part, that process will have been a matter of contemporaneous public
record. But
there is no reason in principle to exclude part of those proceedings
merely because it was not. Just as legal advice communicated
in confidence by
the Government to the Opposition during the parliamentary process might shed
light on the meaning of enacted
so too other
communications during the parliamentary proceedings might shed light on what was
sought to be achieved by its enactment.
Commonwealth parties argued that, expressed at the level appropriate to an
examination of the permissibility of its burden on
freedom of political
communication, the purpose to be ascertained and attributed to
of Ch 11 of
should be confined to that identified in the Revised Explanatory
Memorandum for the
: "to end ongoing dysfunction within the
[Construction and General Division of the CFMEU] and to ensure it is able to
operate effectively
in the interests of its members". That specific purpose,
they argued, must be understood as an aspect of the more general purpose
by the legislative statement of the Parliament's intention in enacting the
of "facilitating the operation of the workplace relations system".
plaintiffs did not contest that purpose. Nor did they suggest that it was not
legitimate. Nor, as their argument developed in
oral submissions, did they
contest that
of Ch 11 of the

reference to that purpose. Plainly, it is.
Pt 2A of Ch 11 of the
is assessed by reference to the purpose of ending
ongoing dysfunction within the Construction and General Division of the CFMEU
to ensuring it is able to operate effectively in the interests of its
members, there can be no doubt that the form of administration
of the Division
for which it provides is reasonably appropriate and adapted to advance that
purpose in a manner that is compatible
with maintenance of the constitutionally
prescribed system of representative government. The burden
freedom of political communication in all of its dimensions is justified as an
incident of the control of the Administrator
over the property and affairs of
the Construction and General Division of the CFMEU. Control of that nature is an
ordinary characteristic
of any form of administration of a corporation or part
of a corporation.
concentration of the plaintiffs' argument was instead on an additional, more
specific, and constitutionally impermissible, purpose
which they argued to be
ascertainable by reference to the proceedings in the Senate which resulted in
its passage of the Bill for
. The plaintiffs crystallised that
purpose as being "the suppression of political donations and activity" by the
Construction and
General Division of the CFMEU.
Bill for the
was introduced into the Senate and read for a second time
on 12 August 2024 by Senator Watt, the Minister for Employment and Workplace
Relations. It was debated extensively in the Senate between 13 and 19 August
2024 before being passed in an amended form by the Senate
with the support of
the Opposition on 19 August 2024. The Bill was then introduced into, read for a
second time and debated in, and
passed by the House of Representatives on 20
August 2024 before receiving the assent of the Governor-General on
22 August 2024.
focus of the plaintiffs' argument was on two things said during the period of
the debate in the Senate which linked to correspondence
not tabled in the Senate
or otherwise published at the time. The first in time was a statement by Senator
Watt during the debate
which occurred in the Senate on 15 August 2024. The
statement was made in an exchange with Senator Cash, the Deputy Leader of the
Opposition in the Senate. As recorded in Hansard, Senator Watt then
"We've already agreed to Senator Cash that the scheme of administration that
would be applied under this legislation would ban donations
to any political
party for the period of the administration. We've already agreed to that. It's
in a letter to Senator Cash saying
it will be in the scheme of administration,
which is part of the legislation."
letter to which Senator Watt was then referring was a letter dated
14 August 2024 addressed from him, as Minister for Employment
and Workplace
Relations, to Senator Cash, as Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.
The letter read in relevant part:
"Subject to passage of the Bill, the Government commits to considering whether
it is in the public interest to make a scheme of administration
that includes
the following features:
Limitations on
donations to political parties (subject to seeking legal advice from my
department)
A power for the
administrator to appoint a special purpose auditor
A requirement
that the administrator must be satisfied that any branch is operating lawfully
and effectively before requesting that
the Minister vary the scheme to end the
administration for a branch."
other was a public statement by Senator Cash on 19 August 2024 in which she was
quoted as having said "I have been provided with
a copy of a letter from the
administrator to the Minister, [Senator] Watt, which clearly sets out the
administrator's goals, and
one of those very clear goals is to ensure that the
CFMEU, in administration is not to incur any form of political campaign
expenditure
or make party political donations and I am prepared to accept
letter to which Senator Cash was then referring was a letter from the
Administrator to Senator Watt dated 19 August 2024 affirming
Administrator "intend[ed] to conduct a lawful Administration" and setting out
certain "principles" and "goals" that he had
determined would guide him should
he decide to accept the appointment. One of the "[g]uiding principles" set out
in the letter was
stated in terms that "[t]he union will not engage in party
politics during the administration: donations; positions at political
conferences; promotion of particular candidates". The letter concluded:
"Further, I can advise you that I intend, should I
be appointed as
Administrator, to vary the rules of the Construction and General Division of the
CFMEU to prohibit the making of
party-political donations or the funding of
party-political campaigns."
the unfolding of subsequent events, the Scheme as determined by the
Attorney-General on 23 August 2024 did not make provision
for any limitations on
donations to political parties. The Divisional Branch Assistant Secretary and
acting Divisional Branch Secretary
of the Construction and General Division of
the Australian Capital Territory Divisional Branch of the CFMEU submitted in
pursuant to a grant of leave to intervene, that he and the Divisional
Branch had been given "interim directions" on 28 August 2024
Administrator not to engage in party politics and to cease party-political
donations. However, the proceeding commenced on
3 September 2024 involved no
allegation that the Administrator had then taken any action in relation to the
engagement of the Construction
and General Division of the CFMEU in party
politics or in relation to the variation of the rules of the Division and the
case filed on 18 October 2024 raised no question as to the validity of
any specific action on the part of the Administrator.
the purposes of answering the constitutional question stated in the special
case, it is sufficient to note that apart from any
other applicable constraint,
the Administrator could not take any action in relation to the engagement of the
Construction and General
Division of the CFMEU in party politics or in relation
to the variation of the rules of the Division unless "satisfied" at the time
that the action is "in the best interests of the members of the Construction and
General Division and its branches" having regard
to the objects of the CFMEU as
defined by the rules of the CFMEU as at 23 August 2024 including the political
objects. Implicit in
the statutory requirement that the Administrator be so
satisfied at the time of the action is a requirement not only that the
Administrator
believe that the action is in the best interests of the members of
the Construction and General Division and its branches having
regard to those
political objects but that the Administrator form that belief according to law
and to reason within limits set by
the subject-matter, scope and purposes of the
The implicit
statutory requirement that the belief be formed according to law has a
constitutional significance to which I will return.
point now to be made is that, regardless of how subsequent events unfolded or
might yet unfold, what was said by Senator Watt
in the Senate on 15 August
2024 (by reference to his letter to Senator Cash on 14 August 2024) and what was
said by Senator Cash
on 19 August 2024 (by reference to the Administrator's
letter to Senator Watt on the same day) are, in my opinion, sufficient basis
from which to infer a qualified form of the additional legislative purpose for
which the plaintiffs argued, being the suppression
of political donations and
activity by the Construction and General Division of the CFMEU. In my opinion,
what was said and written
by Senator Watt and what was said by Senator Cash
cannot be treated as showing nothing more than "the motives or intentions of the
Minister or individual members of the
legislature"
participating in the enactment of the
. The statements show what both
the Government, represented by Senator Watt, and the Opposition, represented by
Senator Cash, wanted
to achieve in fact by its enactment, if they could. The
qualification is important and is something to which I will also return.
the additional purpose properly identified in unqualified terms as the
suppression of political donations and activity by the
Construction and General
Division of the CFMEU, it would not be a purpose compatible with the
constitutionally prescribed system
of representative government. Suppressing
political communication by the whole or some part of an employee organisation
means to a legitimate end, but it cannot be a legitimate end in
in light of the continuing expression of the intention of the Parliament in the
as amended by the
of Ch 11 of the
"an additional object that is not only unexpressed but also constitutionally
impermissible should not lightly be

the qualification is important.
the Government, through Senator Watt, committed to consider the determination of
a scheme which would include limiting the
ability of the Construction and
General Division of the CFMEU to make donations to political parties, that
commitment was expressly
made subject to seeking legal advice. And though the
Opposition, through Senator Cash, was prepared to proceed on an acceptance of
the indication of the Administrator that he would seek to exercise his powers
and perform his functions to ensure that the Division
would not incur political
campaign expenditure or make party political donations whilst in administration,
it is pellucid that the
indication of the Administrator was in the context of an
overarching commitment and legal obligation to exercise his powers and perform
his functions lawfully.
in the statements of Senator Watt or Senator Cash can therefore be taken to
support the inference that the power to determine
a scheme of administration
which was to be conferred on the Minister, or the powers and functions which
were to be conferred on the
Administrator, by provisions of
of Ch 11 of
, were to be able to be used for the purpose of suppressing
political donations and activity by the Construction and General Division
CFMEU if that purpose was not constitutionally permissible. That is to say, the
constitutionally impermissible purpose of
suppressing political donations and
activity by the Construction and General Division of the CFMEU to be ascertained
and attributed
to the Parliament is a purpose the existence of which was and
remains contingent on that purpose being constitutionally permissible.
the standing expression of the intention of Parliament in
Interpretation Act 1901
(Cth) ("the
Interpretation Act
") comes into play and
must be given effect. The section declares that "[e]very Act shall be read and
construed subject to the
Constitution
, and so as not to exceed the legislative
power of the Commonwealth, to the intent that where any enactment thereof would,
this section, have been construed as being in excess of that power, it
shall nevertheless be a valid enactment to the extent to which
it is not in
excess of that power". That is a "general declaration of the contingent
intention of the [Parliament] that if a law
in the form enacted would operate to
transgress a constitutional limitation on legislative power then the law is
still to operate
to the extent constitutionally
permitted".
standard application of the contingent intention so declared by
Interpretation Act
is "to read down a provision expressed in general words so as
to have no application within an area in which legislative power is
subject to a
clear constitutional
limitation",
the implied
freedom of political communication being an example of such a constitutional
limitation. An orthodox instance of this
standard application is to read down a
statutory conferral of a power or function expressed in general terms to
prohibit its exercise
for a constitutionally impermissible

Questions 2 and 3: Implied freedom of
political communication
any particular legislative provisions impermissibly burden freedom of political
communication raises three
provisions effectively burden freedom of political communication? Is the purpose
of the provisions legitimate, being consistent
with the maintenance of the
constitutionally prescribed system of government? Are the provisions reasonably
appropriate and adapted
to advance that purpose in a manner consistent with the
maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of government?
Plaintiffs' submissions
plaintiffs' complaint was twofold. First, they contended that
Administration Act
and, specifically,
s 323K(1)(a)
("the impugned laws") infringed the implied freedom of political
communication. As noted above,
s 323K(1)(a)
gives control of the property
and affairs of the C&G Division and its branches to the
Administrator and
s 323K(1)(d)
gives the Administrator power to perform any
function and exercise any power that the C&G Division, its branches or
could exercise were it not under
administration.
the plaintiffs contended that the Scheme is not authorised
They submitted that, as a result of the Scheme, the
members of the C&G Division lost their collective power given by the CFMEU
Rules to participate in political communications as the C&G Division could
no longer make decisions under the CFMEU Rules or
the C&G Division Rules
expressed as two separate points, the arguments overlapped. In particular,
the second point (stated as a point about the
ambit of the power given by
s 323B(1)) is better understood as an argument that s 323B(1) is so
broadly expressed as to require it
to be read down "to permit only those
exercises of discretion that are within constitutional limits" – that is,
the statutory
question "converges" with the constitutional
breadth of the power of the Minister to make a determination under
s 323B(1), the validity of the Scheme can be tested
by asking whether, if
it had been enacted as legislation, it would have infringed the implied

the Commonwealth defendants contended, there is nothing in the terms of the
Administration Act
or the Scheme which prohibits political communication or
political donations. Rather, the plaintiffs submitted that s 323K(1)(a)
(d) impose a burden on freedom of political communication because the effect of
the provisions is that the C&G Division is
therefore "unable to use its
property to engage in political communication, or to make political donations or
incur expenditure except
with permission of the Administrator", impairing an
"essential function" of the CFMEU. At its highest, the plaintiffs' case was that
burden as the statute and the Scheme would
"authorise" or allow for the "existence of the possibility" of a veto by the
Administrator
over political communication.
to the Administrator having a "veto" over political communication is apt to
mislead. Under the Scheme, the Administrator
decides how the funds of the
C&G Division are to be applied. An available decision
Administrator to apply funds to political communication; the contrary decision
may also be open.
Whether deciding not to apply the funds of the C&G Division for
political purposes is an available course of action for the Administrator
would have to be determined from time to time and in light of the relevant facts
and circumstances. As the Commonwealth defendants
observed, there is no
challenge to the particular exercise of the Administrator's powers before this
Court, nor is such a challenge
raised by the special case.
is necessary to decide any issue of that kind from time to time and in light of
the relevant facts and circumstances because,
in performing functions and
exercising powers as administrator – including making any decisions with
respect to political communication
– the administrator is subject to two
constraints. First, the administrator must be satisfied that they are
"acting in the
best interests of the members" of the C&G Division and
its branches.
although any action taken by the administrator is to have effect despite the
rules of the CFMEU,
the administrator

follows that the question whether the impugned laws do constitute a relevant
"burden" in authorising, and in their application
to, the Scheme requires close
examination. The word "burden" may obscure important features of the law in
issue by focusing too closely
(even solely) upon whether an impugned law may
affect future political communication without giving proper attention to the
legal context within which the impugned law operates or will operate.
risk is especially relevant when, as here, the law in issue concerns the
management and control of an incorporated voluntary
association which has, as
one of its purposes, participating in political affairs. The membership of the
CFMEU (or the C&G Division)
and those members who might be seen as
influencing the CFMEU's (or the C&G Division's) actions are all individuals.
not a single corporate entity. Before the impugned laws were
passed and the C&G Division went into administration, the identity
individuals often changed. To speak of either group as a "collective" treats
them as forming a single coherent body; they
do not. The freedom of the
individuals to participate in political communication is wholly unaffected by
the impugned laws. The freedom
of the C&G Division to participate is
likewise wholly unaffected. What the law does is replace the management
structures of the
C&G Division (for the duration of the administration). The
purposes and objects of the CFMEU are unaltered.
sum, to say that there is a loss of "collective" power to participate in
political communication makes several wrong assumptions.
First, the statement
assumes, wrongly, that the membership of the CFMEU or the membership of
the C&G Division could and did control
particular decisions of elected
officials about whether and how to expend CFMEU funds or advocate on political
issues. The only power
members had over elected officials and their
decision‑making was their ability to influence the elected officials from
to day coupled with their power to vote at elections for officials.
that statement assumes that any change in control of the organisation is a
"burden" on freedom of political communication.
It demands that existing
organisations having political purposes must always be permitted to continue
under existing organisational
and management arrangements.
it implicitly assumes that the members of the C&G Division (ie, the
collective) cannot lawfully regroup or reorganise
to pursue political aims and
participate in political debate of the kind which otherwise would have been
undertaken by the organisation
brought under administration. As the Commonwealth
defendants submitted, there is no restriction on the ability of members to
in political activity either with each other or as an association of
people. The possibility of regrouping and reorganising either
organisation of employees or by participating in some other existing
organisation of employees is
it assumes, wrongly, that the Administrator must not permit
the organisation to participate in political affairs. But that
is not what
Administration Act
, read with the CFMEU Rules and the Scheme, provides.
The only reference within those instruments to political communication is a
positive requirement for the administrator to have regard to the objects of
the CFMEU to raise political levies, donate to and/or
affiliate with
political parties when performing functions and exercising powers as
administrator.
is no burden on the freedom of political communication of
the C&G Division. The C&G Division and its members' ability
engage in political communication is not impaired or adversely affected by the
impugned laws. However, even if there was a burden,
that burden would be imposed
for a legitimate purpose and justified for the reasons set out below.
Question 2: Legitimate purpose
next question is whether the purpose of the impugned laws is legitimate, being
consistent with the maintenance of the constitutionally
prescribed system of
government. That purpose is the same as the purpose of the Scheme which was
authorised by

, as well as oral and
other communications between Senator Murray Watt, the Minister for Employment
and Workplace Relations, and others,
it is necessary first to deal with some
basic and settled propositions about ascertaining legislative purpose.
s 15AA of the
Acts Interpretation Act 1901
(Cth) ("the AIA")
states that, in interpreting a provision of an Act, "the interpretation that
would best achieve the purpose or object
of the Act (whether or not that purpose
or object is expressly stated in the Act) is to be preferred to each other
interpretation".
In the interpretation of a provision of an Act, the material
capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of a provision
material that is part of the
"material not forming part of the Act [which] is capable of assisting in the
ascertainment of the meaning of the
provision".
Consideration may be given to the latter material, often described as extrinsic
material, only for the limited purposes specified
"(a) to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning
conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account
its context in the Act
and the purpose or object underlying the Act; or
(b) to determine the meaning of the provision when:
(i) the provision is ambiguous or obscure; or
(ii) the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into
account its context in the Act and the purpose or object
underlying the Act
leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable."
the use of extrinsic material is limited to those purposes is reinforced by
Section 15AB(3)
, often overlooked, provides that
"[i]n determining whether consideration should be given to any material in
accordance with subsection
(1), or in considering the weight to be given to any
such material, regard shall be had, in addition to any other relevant matters,
to ... the desirability of persons being able to rely on the ordinary meaning
conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account
its context in the Act
and the purpose or object underlying the Act".
Section 15AB(2)
"[w]ithout limiting the generality of subsection (1), the material that may be
in accordance with that subsection
in the interpretation of a
provision of an Act includes" (emphasis added), among other things:
(e) any explanatory memorandum relating to the Bill containing the provision, or
any other relevant document, that was laid before,
or furnished to the members
of, either House of the Parliament by a Minister before the time when the
provision was enacted;
(f) the speech made to a House of the Parliament by a Minister on the occasion
of the moving by that Minister of a motion that the
Bill containing the
provision be read a second time in that House;

the ultimate goal of facilitating the operation of the federal workplace

on the other hand, submitted that the

Plaintiffs' contentions in relation to illegitimate
accepting that the Commonwealth's identified purpose in enacting

was to suppress political donations and activity by the C&G

plaintiffs sought to rely upon various materials in relation to the Bill which
introduced the

other aspects of what they described as the "legislative history". Nothing in
any of these materials supports the plaintiffs'

The Explanatory Memorandum then listed other serious allegations of

General Manager had stated in the application
to the Federal Court that they had

For some time now, the government has made clear that, if the matter was not
resolved before parliament returned, we would introduce
legislation to
facilitate administration, if it was determined to be in the public
It is the government's firm view that enabling administration, not
deregistration, is the strongest action to take in these circumstances.
Deregistration of the [C&G] Division would not stop the union from
participating in a range of industrial activities, like bargaining.
Placing the
[C&G] Division into administration would maintain the regulation and
additional oversight that applies to registered
organisations and ensure the
division acts in the best interests of its members.
This bill amends the [FWRO Act] to allow the minister to determine a scheme of
administration for the [C&G] Division, if satisfied
it is in the public
interest to do so.
The bill contains a non-exhaustive list of the matters that may be included in a
scheme – such as the suspension or removal
of officers, taking
disciplinary action, and making changes to the [C&G] Division's rules.
A scheme of administration would be targeted towards the [C&G] Division of
the CFMEU, and would be time limited. It will not
apply to other unions or
to other divisions of the CFMEU.
The bill includes strong powers for the administrator and would allow them to
take action necessary to restore the effective management
and operation of the
[C&G] Division.
Under a scheme of administration, the administrator would have control of the
property and affairs of the [C&G] Division and
its branches. They would have
the power to:
property of the division and its branches, and
undertake any
functions, or exercise any power, that officers of the division or its branches
would normally undertake.
This would enable the administrator to take all necessary action to manage the
affairs of the division, in the interests of members.
We want to ensure any administration that may be determined is undertaken fairly
and with the appropriate level of scrutiny. Safeguards
for the administration
would include:
a limitation on
the duration of the scheme to no more than three years, with provision for the
minister to terminate the administration
earlier with the agreement of the
administrator.
They would also include:
ensuring the
administrator is subject to oversight by the General Manager of the Fair Work
Commission, who may investigate whether
the scheme is being effectively
implemented.
The allegations about the behaviour of some [C&G] Division members and
associates are serious, and unlawful behaviour in any
workplace is unacceptable.
This bill provides an effective mechanism to enable the [C&G] Division of
the CFMEU to be placed into
administration if it is determined to be in the
public interest. The government will continue to support strong action to
these issues."
the absence of any reference to political donations or any intention of seeking
to suppress political donations and activity
by the C&G Division in
the Explanatory Memoranda or the Second Reading Speech, the plaintiffs then
sought to rely on other materials
("the further materials") in support of their
contention that the
Administration Act
had a further, illegitimate purpose.
they sought to rely on statements made in parliamentary debates about whether
the Bill should be amended to ban political
donations, including Senate debates
on 13 August 2024, 14 August 2024
and 15 August 2024.
they relied on a letter from Senator Watt to Senator Michaelia Cash dated
14 August 2024, which stated that "[s]ubject to
passage of the Bill,
the Government commits to considering whether it is in the public interest
to make a scheme of administration
that includes the following features ...
Limitations on donations to political parties (subject to seeking legal advice
from my department)".
they relied on a letter from Mr Irving KC, who at that point had been approached
to be the administrator but was not yet appointed,
to Senator Watt dated 19
August 2024 in which Mr Irving KC stated he had "determined a set of principles
and goals that would guide"
him as administrator, noting that he nonetheless
"reached no deals or understandings about how powers invested in [him] will be
and that giving a binding commitment would be "improper".
Specifically, he said that "[t]he union will not engage in party politics
the administration: donations; positions at political party conferences;
promotion of particular candidates".
they relied on parliamentary debate in the Senate on 19 August 2024 where
Senator James Paterson stated, "What we know is
that some of the suggestions put
forward by Senator Cash and the coalition have been agreed to in principle by
the government ...
They include commitments to ensuring political donations and
political expenditure from the CFMEU are banned during the period of
administration."
to that debate, in a press conference on the same day, Senator Cash said,
"I have been provided with a copy of a letter
from the administrator to
[Senator Watt], which clearly sets out the administrator's goals, and one
of those very clear goals is
to ensure that the CFMEU, in administration is not
to incur any form of political campaign expenditure or make party political
and I am prepared to accept that."
the Senate agreed to the Bill, on 20 August 2024 the Bill was debated in the
House, where Anne Webster MP stated that "[t]he
administrator has also
undertaken to ensure that the CFMEU will not engage in party politics during the
administration, including
making donations, having positions at party
conferences or promoting
candidates"
Fletcher MP stated that "[a] very important point is that, while the CFMEU
is in administration, it would be entirely inappropriate
and improper for the
CFMEU to continue to shovel millions of dollars towards the Labor Party in
political donations. I'm pleased
to say that, thanks to the assiduous work of
Senator Cash, the administrator has now set out in writing the guiding
principles and
goals he determined before accepting the role. One of those is as
follows: 'The union will not engage in party politics during the
administration:
donations, positions at political party conferences, and promotions of
candidates.'"
stopping donations to a political party was an issue for some of the
parliamentarians, the plaintiffs could not point to
any amendment to the Bill
reflecting anything said in any of the further materials. Put in different
terms, there was nothing to
link any of the further materials to the text
Administration Act
, as enacted. And neither of the letters now relied on
was in the public domain. To the extent that the letters were referred to in
parliamentary debates, such references form part of the extrinsic material that
the Court may consider. Otherwise, it is impermissible
to have regard to the
private letters. The meaning of an Act cannot be determined by reference to
material that will, by reason of
its private nature, not be available to
all who may need to ascertain that meaning. That is consistent with the nature
of the materials
referred to in s 15AB(2) of the AIA, all of which are
publicly available.
The parliamentary
debate in the Senate on 15 August 2024 alluded to the existence of a letter from
Senator Watt to Senator Cash,
with Senator Watt stating: "We've already agreed
to Senator Cash that the scheme of administration that would be applied under
legislation would ban donations to any political party for the period of
the administration."
Further, as has been explained, an extract of part of the letter from Mr Irving
KC was read out by Mr Fletcher MP in the parliamentary
debate on 20 August
2024, after the Senate had agreed to the
But despite
these references, the text of the Bill was not relevantly amended. Taken at
their highest, the further materials may
reveal the subjective political
considerations which may have affected the views and motives of some members of
Parliament. They
say nothing about the objective intention of the law. It
follows that, consistent with principle and s 15AB of the AIA, the further
materials are not relevant to the construction of the
Administration Act
they say nothing about the purpose of the

is for those reasons that the plaintiffs' contention that a further
"illegitimate" purpose of
was to suppress political donations and activity
by the C&G Division is rejected.
Multiple purposes
the conclusion that the purpose of
of Ch 11 of the
is legitimate,
it is unnecessary to express any concluded view on whether a law which has an
illegitimate purpose will not infringe
the implied freedom provided that one or
more of its substantial or material ends is legitimate and it is reasonably
appropriate
and adapted to advancing that purpose. That proposition was not the
subject of any submission in this Court. It is sufficient to
observe that the
proposition is inconsistent with the approach this Court has taken in assessing
whether the purpose advanced by
a challenged law is compatible with the
constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible
government.
inconsistency would be even more apparent where a subsidiary or incidental
purpose of the law was relied on to justify the burden
imposed by the law even
though the law was intended to curtail freedom of political
communication.

particularly given the proceedings would be contested and may have been

Minister, Senator Watt, intervened in the Federal Court proceedings

because that matter was not resolved before Parliament returned that the
Government introduced legislation to facilitate administration,
determined to be in the public
would placing only specific branches of the C&G Division under
administration have been an equally practicable means of achieving
the Administration Act's objective, since the purpose of the law related to
the lawful and effective operation of the C&G Division
as a whole.
Alleged contraventions of federal industrial legislation were not confined
to certain C&G Divisional branches. Further,
the various branches of the
C&G Division share a common "supreme governing body" and
to address a corporation's unlawful or improper conduct often includes the
taking of control of property. A provision giving
effect to such control may be
both necessary and appropriate. For example, under the
Corporations Act 2001
(Cth), an administrator appointed by the company itself, a liquidator or a
secured party

Corporations Act
Federal Court of Australia Act 1976
(Cth) is afforded a significant
degree of control. Under
Corporations Act
receiver of property of a corporation has power to do, in Australia and
elsewhere, all things necessary or convenient to be done
for or in connection
with, or as incidental to, the attainment of the objectives for which the
receiver was appointed". This includes
power "to enter into possession and
take control of property of the corporation in accordance with the terms of [a
court order or
the instrument appointing the
receiver]".

, the Court may, on
such terms and conditions as the Court thinks fit, appoint a
When in any
cause pending in the Court a receiver appointed by the Court is in
possession of property, "the receiver shall manage
and deal with
the property according to the requirements of the laws of the State or
Territory in which the property is situated,
in the same manner as that in which
the owner or possessor of the property would be bound to do if in possession of
the property".
the mere taking of control of property could infringe the implied freedom, then
a question would arise as to whether any appointment
of a liquidator,
receiver or administrator would infringe the implied freedom because modern
corporations frequently engage in communication
on issues such as
climate change, the economy, or industrial relations.

statutory purpose derived
from the text of an Act beyond observing the

is not established by any decided case and nothing
that is said in any decided
case points towards the existence of such an approach. That is unsurprising
given that the Court's task
is to identify the law's purpose and not to decide
or to alter its purpose. Third, on its face, the argument appears to depend upon
the text of other legislative provisions, or statements made in selected
passages in cases decided in other contexts.
those reasons, the answer to Questions 2 and 3 is "No".
4: Ch III of the
Constitution
Parties' submissions
plaintiffs submitted that
is contrary to Ch III of the
Constitution
as it creates detriments that are capable of being seen as
either legislative punishment or executive punishment. With respect to
legislative punishment
, the plaintiffs submitted that s 323B is
properly characterised as "a bill of pains and penalties" as it involves the
legislative
determination of breach by a person of an antecedent standard of
conduct and the legislative imposition of punishment consequent

Minister makes a determination under s 323B, ss 323K and 323B(3)
mandate that the scheme
must have certain content and certain consequences which
are capable of being characterised as punishment.
plaintiffs initially set out a list of detriments imposed by ss 323B and
323K that could amount to "punishment", being: interference
with property;
removal of officers from office; interference with contractual rights;
and disenfranchisement (with respect to the
power to vacate offices and
control elections). In oral argument, however, the plaintiffs narrowed their
focus to s 323K, stating
that the "clearest indication" of punishment was
the way that s 323K "deals with property".
Commonwealth defendants submitted that s 323B does not confer power to
impose any measure that is prima facie punitive. Alternatively,
plaintiffs' identified detriments could be characterised as prima facie
punitive, they were justified. In relation to s 323K,
the Commonwealth
defendants submitted that the deprivation of property not linked to the
adjudgment and punishment of guilt was not
prima facie
No relevant distinction between legislative and
executive punishment
is no relevant distinction to be drawn in this case between legislative and
executive punishment. As accepted by the plaintiffs,
the test as to whether the
measure is punitive is the same: a law will be contrary to Ch III if the law
itself is or the law confers
on the Executive or the legislature a power
"to impose a measure that is properly characterised as penal or

characterisation",
although in practice the Court has approached that question by asking two

(2) if the law is prima facie punitive, whether it has a legitimate non-punitive

No legislative punishment
the Commonwealth defendants submitted, s 323B cannot be characterised as "a
bill of pains and penalties" as there is no legislative
determination of breach
by some person of an antecedent standard of conduct, and no legislative
imposition on that person of punishment
consequent on the determination of
breach. A bill of pains and penalties will identify the specific individual or
individuals said
to breach the antecedent standard of
Section 323B,
however, only speaks generally of the officers or employees of the C&G
Division and does not specify any individuals.
This is unsurprising, given that
the membership and management of the C&G Division often
s 323B does not arise out of any legislative determination of breach.
Section 323B was enacted in response to a state of
affairs where the C&G
Division had ceased to function effectively, not because of a breach of an
antecedent standard of
Even if the
law was enacted in response to the CFMEU's unlawful activity, that was on the
basis of the long history of contraventions

proven in the Federal Court, not any adjudication by Parliament.
s 323HA requires the administrator to establish a complaints procedure in
relation to improper, unlawful or criminal conduct
and makes provision for the
investigation of complaints. Further, s 323K(2A) provides that the administrator
may undertake investigations
into past practices of the C&G Division and its
branches. These provisions are inconsistent with Parliament proceeding on the
basis that the allegations with respect to the C&G Division are true:
there would be no need for the administrator to investigate
any complaints or
past conduct if that were the case.
No executive
relation to the allegation of
punishment, the detriment imposed
by s 323K cannot be characterised as for a punitive purpose. As submitted
by the Commonwealth defendants,
the mere fact of an interference with the
control of property does not itself make the law prima facie punitive.
Duncan v New South Wales
the Court determined that the
mere legislative deprivation of valuable assets did not equate to punishment in
the sense relevant to
logic extends to executive deprivation of property. Under
, control of
property is vested in the administrator for a temporary period for a protective
purpose. Insofar as s 323K causes any
detriment to an officer who can no
longer control the property of the C&G Division, that does not reflect a
punishment for an
adjudgment of guilt.
those reasons, ss 323B and 323K are not punitive. No question of
justification arises. The answer to Question 4 is "No".

– Question 5
states that "[w]hile the [C&G] Division and its
branches are under administration, the administrator ... has control of the

the CFMEU is the legal entity that holds the property and therefore
entity to be deprived of control of the property. The C&G Division is not a
separate legal entity. Any "property" affected
is the property
of the CFMEU.

plaintiffs' submission that any compensation paid under

Section 323K(1)(a)
provides that, while the C&G Division and its branches
are under administration, the administrator has control of "the property

would not be construed as extending to compensation

Commonwealth to the CFMEU under
no basis within the CFMEU Rules, or elsewhere, for the assertion that any
compensation received by the CFMEU under s 323S

responsible for claiming any compensation,
such as the National Office.

VIII. Conclusion
I. Introduction
Construction, Forestry and Maritime Employees Union ("the CFMEU") had 126,063
members as at 31 December 2023 (with each member
permitted to belong to
only one of its three
2019, there have been 1,163 occasions on which the CFMEU and its officers have
been found to have breached various industrial
The CFMEU and
its officers have incurred more than $10 million in penalties. Between July
and August 2024, news articles were published
in print and online media
concerning officers of the CFMEU and one of its divisions, the Construction and
General Division ("the
C&G Division"). The articles alleged intimidation,
assault, and corruption. Between one and nine officers of each of the six
and Territory governing bodies of the C&G Division, as well as officers of
the C&G Divisional Executive, have been
found to have engaged in
contraventions.
23 August 2024, the same day that legislative amendments enacted by the
Commonwealth Parliament came into effect ("the Legislative
Amendments"),
Commonwealth Executive determined a scheme under the provisions inserted by the
Legislative Amendments placing the C&G Division
of the CFMEU into
administration ("the
Determination").
special case is brought by two plaintiffs who held various offices in the
C&G Division of the CFMEU which were vacated by
the scheme of
administration. The plaintiffs challenge the constitutional validity of the
Legislative Amendments and, therefore,
the statutory authority for the
Determination. The questions in the special case condense to essentially four
substantive questions:
(1) Are the Legislative Amendments supported by a constitutional head of power?
(2) Does the implied freedom of political communication:
(i) preclude legislative power for the Legislative Amendments, with the effect
(ii) the Determination is invalid?
(3) Are the Legislative Amendments contrary to Ch III of the
Constitution
(4) Do the Legislative Amendments effect an acquisition of property other than
on just terms contrary to
Constitution
answer to the first question is "yes" and the answer to each of the second,
third, and fourth questions is "no". Each of these
questions is considered
separately below. But central to all of them is a consideration of the role of
legislative purpose and the
terms and purpose of the Legislative Amendments.
Some members of this Court take different approaches in this case to the role of
legislative purpose in relation to the implied freedom of political
communication in the
Constitution
. The reason for this may be the
different weight placed by different members of this Court upon precedent and
its various dimensions.
II. The role of legislative
(i) Discerning the purposes of a legislative provision
Parliament,
being the combined operation of the two Houses of Parliament and the King (as
represented by the
Governor-General),
does not have thoughts. Nor are the thoughts of individual members of Parliament
attributed to Parliament. Yet, for centuries the
courts have referred to the
purpose and intention of Parliament in enacting laws. The reason for this is
that Parliament is used
as a construct to reflect our techniques of
understanding ordinary verbal communication. If the words of general legislation
to speak to, and be understood by, the population at large then they must be
capable of being interpreted by the same techniques
of understanding ordinary
verbal communication. The meaning of verbal communication in everyday life
involves identifying an assumed
purpose of the speaker or writer and
ascertaining the context in which the speaker or writer uses particular words.
The same technique
is reflected in the ordinary processes of legislative
interpretation, which rely upon a notional intention and purpose of the
of Parliament. The statutory and common law rules of interpretation
have developed to allow recourse to a very wide range of materials
to determine
the intention and purpose of
Parliament.
identification of legislative purpose uses ordinary language processes of
interpretation
the focus upon identifying the purpose at the right level of generality based
upon the mischief to which the provision is
with ordinary verbal communication, there is a difference between each of:
(i) the purpose of legislation, expressed at
the right level of generality;
(ii) the motive that any member of Parliament might have for supporting
legislation with that purpose;
(iii) the means used to achieve that
purpose; and (iv) the foreseeable or actual effect of the legislation enacted
for that purpose.
Legislative purpose is thus the ultimate goal or end to be achieved, distinct
from the "political
for pursuing that purpose, the means used to achieve that purpose, or the
foreseeable or actual effect of the
legislation.
legislation that restricts the availability of classified information. The means
used might be criminal sanctions for any communication
of that information. The
restrictions on the classified information might have foreseeable and actual
effects of restricting political
debate about national defence. And there may
even be members of Parliament whose motive in supporting the proposed
legislation included
a desire to suppress political speech on the topic of
national security. But the purpose of the legislation is not to burden the
freedom of political communication: it is to ensure the security of the
(ii) The use of private correspondence to discern
legislative purpose
Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth correctly submitted that to the extent
that private correspondence is not in the public
domain at the time of the
enactment of legislation, that correspondence, even if it relates to the passage
of the legislation, has
extremely limited utility as extrinsic material in
ascertaining the legislation's purpose. One instance of such limited utility was
given by French CJ and Gummow J in
Commonwealth
where their Honours referred to the use of such private materials (which were
not in the public domain at the time a provision was
passed by Parliament) in
order to understand the contemporary (and ascertainable) public usage of a
phrase at that time. In this
very limited way, the existence or content of
private materials that are not available to members of the public might be used
courts merely as evidence of matters that are widely known to the public.
the other hand, also in
Commonwealth
Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ suggested that private materials might be used
to "disclose the issue" to which the provision was directed.
Their Honours
should not be taken to have been suggesting that the utility of private
materials could be extended beyond the limited
use recognised by French CJ
and Gummow J. If the legal meaning of a statutory provision were altered
due to matters in private material
that are not known to the general public at
the time the provision is enacted, and perhaps for many years subsequently if
the material
remains private, then that legal meaning might be unascertainable
by any member of the public other than the parties to the private
conclusion is anathema to the transparency required in any society ordered by
law. And it would turn upon their head the fundamental
principles of public
intelligibility that motivate the interpretation of
legislation.
(iii) No judicial power to disregard an
unconstitutional purpose
plaintiffs submitted that the purpose of the Legislative Amendments is to impose
legislative or executive punishment and also
that the purpose is to burden the
freedom of political communication. If the plaintiffs were correct in those
submissions then this
Court would have no judicial power to uphold the
constitutional validity of the Legislative Amendments on the basis that some
additional, valid purpose could be found. In the extremely rare
circumstances where the very goal or aim of Parliament is to legislate
Constitution
it is the judicial duty to uphold the
Constitution
reason that circumstances will be extremely rare in which a Parliament will be
found to have a purpose (design, object, or aim)
of acting contrary to an
express or implied requirement of the
Constitution
lies in the difference
between purposes, on the one hand, and motives, means, or foreseeable effects,
on the other. It is never sufficient
to invalidate a law merely to demonstrate
that one of the motives of members of Parliament was to burden the freedom of
communication, or that the means used by the law or the foreseeable
effects of the law would burden that freedom. It is true that,
in one sense, a
means chosen to achieve an ultimate purpose might be described as an
intermediate purpose.
But, as explained above, the relevant legislative purposes for a law are only
the ultimate goals of the law, not the means by which
those goals are achieved.
would be surprising if hypothetical legislation containing a single law enacted
"For the Purposes of Impairing Free Political
Communication and Other Purposes"
could be consistent with the implied freedom of political communication. Indeed,
as explained later
in these reasons, the essence of the test for justification
of a law that has the
of burdening freedom of political
communication requires consideration of the proportionality of the means used by
the law to achieve
a legitimate purpose. The consideration of whether a law is
justified is not concerned with whether a
that is contrary to the
Constitution
can be justified by reference to other purposes that are
consistent with the
Constitution
. Nor does the consideration of whether a
law is justified involve asking whether the means used to achieve the purposes
are proportionate to some, but not all, of the law's purposes.
Indeed, as explained below, to ignore or remove one of a law's purposes
the law a different meaning and therefore a different effect.
(iv) No judicial power to amend the purposes of legislative
the oral argument of this special case, an issue was raised with senior counsel
for the plaintiffs as to whether it is a legitimate
technique of judicial
interpretation or application to "read down" the purposes of a statutory
provision, or even the purposes of
an entire statute, if the provision or
legislation were found to have an illegitimate purpose. Senior counsel for the
correctly submitted that this "simply cannot be done". No other party
made any submission in favour of a change of such enormity
to permit "reading
down" to remove statutory purposes or "reading up" to insert new statutory
purposes. They were right not to do
so. Such a reallocation of power would
involve courts crossing the Rubicon between adjudicating and legislating, and
marching upon
the power of Parliament.
limits of judicial power in cases concerning the interpretation of Commonwealth
legislation are marked out by saving provisions
Acts Interpretation Act 1901
(Cth), which effectively provides that every
Act shall be "read and construed" (that is, interpreted and applied) as subject
Constitution
. But the court's function remains "to construe the
statute in the light of s 15A, not to assume the role of legislator and to
a law within
Starke and Dixon JJ said nearly a century ago: "s 15A cannot apply to
divert legislation from one purpose to
fundamental principle has not changed.
Section 15A
has been used in three ways to preserve the validity of a statutory provision
that would otherwise be contrary to the
Constitution
. These three
techniques, although overlapping language is sometimes (confusingly) used to
describe them, are distinct. The three
techniques, with different labels, are:
(i) reading "down" (or reading
) the meaning of a
statutory provision where alternative interpretations are reasonably open;
(ii) notional severance of statutory
words to alter the meaning or
application of a statutory provision; and (iii) partial disapplication of
the application of a statutory
legislation, such as the
Fair Work Act 2009
(Cth), gives primacy to the
technique, subject to a contrary
partially disapplying the legislation in its invalid
applications.
other techniques can involve changes to statutory meaning. But none of the three
legitimate methods of using saving provisions
Interpretation Act
permit a court to amend or alter the purpose of the
provision. None of the three methods can be used if the resulting interpretation
or application of the provision would result in the provision having a
"different policy".
That would be the effect of changing the purposes of the provision by the
removal or addition of a purpose. If the expression "reading
down" were used to
describe the removal of a legislative purpose, it would be a euphemism. The
purpose would not be "read" at all.
It would be removed.
techniques of interpretation and application of legislation mark out the limits
of judicial power to preserve validity. The
limits of judicial power are
therefore reached at the point of identification of Parliament's purpose. Like
almost all other communication,
the purpose of a legislative utterance informs
how that utterance should be understood. Altering the purpose of a legislative
has the effect of amending the manner in which that provision will be
interpreted. That is why it has been said many times in this
Court that the text
of legislation must be considered at the same time as legislative context and
That is why
Dixon CJ said that "the context, the general purpose and policy of a
provision and its consistency and fairness are surer
guides to its meaning than
the logic with which it is
constructed".
why the limit to the interpretative duty in s 3(1) of the
Human Rights
(UK)—to "read and give[] effect [to]" (interpret and apply)
legislation consistently with Convention rights "[s]o far as it
is possible to
do so"—is reached when the interpretation or application would not "go
with the grain of the
legislation"
be inconsistent with the "underlying thrust of the
legislation".
also why s 6 of the
permits a statutory enactment to be given "a meaning that is consistent with the
rights and freedoms" therein if the meaning
gives effect to, and does not
stultify, the statutory
would not merely be an arrogation of legislative power to this Court for the
Court to amend a legislative purpose. It would require
this Court to revisit
large swathes of its jurisprudence. For instance, if Commonwealth legislation
were invalid because it had a
or was deemed
to have a punitive
contrary to
Ch III of the
Constitution
, then that legislation could be revived
by judicially removing the punitive purpose to create a new law based on any
other, non-punitive
purpose. Or legislation that was invalid because it had the
purpose of discriminating against interstate trade or
contrary to
Constitution
could be revived by judicial
sculpting of Parliament's purpose to create a new law that would be interpreted
and applied without Parliament's
discriminatory purpose.

plaintiffs relied upon various extrinsic materials to assert that the
Legislative Amendments had a purpose of burdening the freedom

communication. Some of the materials upon which the plaintiffs relied were not
in the public domain. For instance, the
plaintiffs relied upon a letter from the
Minister to Senator Cash (the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the
Senate) dated
14 August 2024. In that letter the Minister set out several
features of the scheme of administration contemplated in the Bill to
Government was giving consideration and the Minister said that the Government
would engage in targeted consultation, including
with the Coalition, "[b]efore
making a decision in relation to any such scheme".
plaintiffs also relied upon a letter from the proposed administrator ("the
Administrator") to the Minister dated 19 August 2024
in which the
Administrator expressed his intention, in the event of his appointment, to vary
the C&G Division Rules to prohibit
the making of party-political donations
or the funding of party-political campaigns.

ordered by law for a court to interpret
laws by reference to communications

plaintiffs rightly
pointed out, some of the information in the above letters
came into the public domain before the Legislative Amendments were passed.
that form, the public information can inform the purpose of legislation.
background to the Legislative Amendments is that the
Fair Work (Registered
Organisations) Amendment (Administration) Bill 2024
(Cth) was introduced in
the Senate on 12 August 2024. Debate in the Senate commenced the following
day. On 15 August 2024, reference
was made to the Minister's letter in that
chamber. The Minister said:
"We have already agreed in a letter to Senator Cash ... that the scheme of
administration that would be applied under this legislation
would ban donations
to any political party for the period of the administration. We've already
agreed to that. It's in a letter to
Senator Cash saying it will be in the
scheme of administration, which is part of the legislation."
The Senate failed to agree to the Bill that day. A second stage of debate
commenced thereafter, and the Senate ultimately passed the
19 August 2024.
19 August 2024, at a press conference, Senator Cash said the following
"I have been provided with a copy of a letter from the administrator to the
Minister, Murray Watt, which clearly sets out the administrator's
goals, and one
of those very clear goals is to ensure that the CFMEU, in administration is not
to incur any form of political campaign
expenditure or make party political
donations and I am prepared to accept that."
20 August 2024, during debate of the Bill in the House of Representatives,
the then Manager of Opposition Business in the House,
Mr Fletcher, advised
that the Administrator had "set out in writing the guiding principles and goals
he determined before accepting
the role". Select passages from the
Administrator's letter were read verbatim including a passage expressing the
Administrator's
intention "to vary the rules of the [C&G Division] to
prohibit the making of party political donations or the funding of party
political campaigns". The Bill passed the House of Representatives that day and
received Royal Assent on 22 August 2024.
public materials might illuminate the motives of some of those who supported the
Legislative Amendments. They might provide
some insight into the means used to
achieve passage of the Legislative Amendments. And they might reveal foreseeable
effects of the
Legislative Amendments. For instance, the public materials
suggest that some, perhaps many, of those members of Parliament who supported
the Legislative Amendments had the motive that the legislation would not be
applied by the Administrator to make political donations
or incur political
campaign expenditure with any CFMEU or C&G Division funds. The public
materials also suggest an understanding
that the means by which any legislative
purpose was expected to be achieved, and therefore a foreseeable effect of the
Legislative
Amendments, included that the Administrator would vary the C&G
Division Rules so as to prevent the making of political donations,
incurring of political campaign expenditure, with any CFMEU or C&G Division

Cunliffe v The

"the test of reasonable proportionality has an important role to play when the

it seeks to protect or

operation or effect?"
Secondly, and if so, is the purpose of the law "legitimate, in the sense [of
being] compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally

of representative and responsible government?" Thirdly, if the purpose (or

freedom of political communication cannot be invalid
on the basis of the implied
freedom. But the extent of the burden becomes important when assessing whether

For the reasons
that I gave in
the earliest applications of structured proportionality might be understood as
having deployed that test as only one option
for the analysis of whether a law
employed a means that was reasonably appropriate and adapted to advance its

, which treats
structured proportionality as only one of the options in a large suite of
alternatives, there is presently no majority
view as to when structured
proportionality should be applied and, if it is not applied, which alternative
should be deployed in those
cases where a judge chooses not to apply structured
proportionality. The effect of the current state of the law is that the

which has been consistently employed by majorities of this Court
in order to
enhance transparency of reasoning and certainty of outcome, will now decrease
transparency and increase uncertainty.
is the worst of all worlds. On Mondays, structured proportionality might be
applied in its entirety as the test of justification
for the implied freedom of
political communication. On Tuesdays, structured proportionality might be
applied as the test without
its first aspect. On Wednesdays, structured
proportionality might not be applied at all and the justification of burdens on
the implied
freedom might be tested by reference to the vague formula of
"reasonably appropriate and adapted". On Thursdays, one judge might
Monday's approach, another might take Tuesday's and a third might take
Wednesday's. Cases would need to be argued by reference
to a number of different
tests which might point in different directions. Nobody would know whether or
when a judge would choose
to apply structured proportionality as the
proportionality test. Judicial decisions in such cases would be open to the

idiosyncratic policy preference.
can be little doubt that different formulations of proportionality can lead to
different results and that the different formulations
have "high costs to
institutional integrity and
legitimacy".
examples can be given to illustrate how different results might be achieved as a
consequence of adopting different tests for
whether a law that burdens the
freedom of political communication employs means that are reasonably appropriate
and adapted to its
legitimate purpose.
first example would arise if in some cases a judge chose to apply only one or
other of the aspects of structured proportionality.
For instance, if only a
suitability analysis were applied, and if suitability were to be understood as
requiring only a rational
connection between the purpose of a law and its
meaning or intended
proportionality enquiry would be redundant. No law would ever fail to be
reasonably appropriate and adapted. This is because
it is beyond argument that
the identification of a statutory purpose is achieved by the ordinary processes
of statutory
interpretation.
Purpose is identified from the meaning and intended effect of the law. Even in
the most extreme case where no purpose can be identified
for a law at any level
of generality higher than the meaning of its
the intended
meaning of the law will (by definition) be a rational means of achieving that
confuse matters further, there might be dispute about whether "suitability"
should be given the meaning ascribed to it in
or whether it might
be given an expanded meaning, conflated with reasonable necessity, that
considers any overreach of the means used
by the law to achieve its purposes.
Nevertheless, if the test for proportionality were limited to an analysis of
suitability in the
strict sense described in
, then judges who had
decided cases upon the basis of a lack of reasonable necessity or a lack of
adequacy in the balance might have
decided those cases differently. The lack of
reasonable necessity for the impugned provisions, as Kiefel CJ, Bell and
Keane JJ found
would not have been sufficient for their Honours to conclude that all
of those provisions were invalid despite the suitability of
some of them. Or the
lack of the law's adequacy in the balance, as Gageler J and Gleeson J
Farm Transparency International Ltd v New South
have been sufficient for their Honours to conclude that the relevant
provisions were invalid despite their suitability.
second example would arise if the concepts in each aspect of structured
proportionality were replaced by an analysis that avoided
asking any of the
three questions, or treated the answers to any of those questions as only
factors to be considered, in an overall
form of instinctive synthesis of all
matters thought to affect whether a law is reasonably appropriate and adapted to
its purpose.
On that view, whether the law is "reasonably necessary" might be
one factor to consider but it would not be conclusive. The black
"reasonably appropriate and adapted" could be applied so that in cases where
members of this Court find a law not to be reasonably
necessary, the law might
still be upheld. Conversely, in cases where members of this Court find a law to
be reasonably necessary,
the law might nevertheless be invalidated.
path forward for a future without structured proportionality, but with the use
of reasonable necessity, might provide content to
the black box of "reasonably
appropriate and adapted" by reference to any asserted obvious and compelling
alternative, the strength
of which might vary according to the
circumstances.
path would not require any focus on "suitability" (as that concept has been
traditionally understood) and would reserve questions
of "appropriateness" or
the balance between political values for only the most extreme cases. On any
view, some principle must be
enunciated to govern any proportionality analysis.
But, at least within particular categories and perhaps across categories, that
principle should be consistent.
resolution of these issues will have to await another case. For the present, I
remain of the view that, for the implied freedom
implicature, it is appropriate
to ask whether the law, having a legitimate purpose, burdens the freedom of
political communication
and, if so, to apply a structured proportionality
analysis to test whether the law employs means that are reasonably appropriate
and adapted to the legitimate purpose of the law.
appropriate level of the analysis: the Legislative Amendments as applied by the
Determination
questions in this case concerning the implied freedom of political communication
focus, respectively, upon each of (i) the Legislative
Amendments and
(ii) the Determination, as made by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth
(acting pursuant to authorisation by the
Minister to exercise the Minister's
powers under
). The first
question is concerned with the operation of the
Constitution
upon the Legislative Amendments. In oral submissions the Solicitor-General of
the Commonwealth commenced with a proper and
appropriate concession: "We accept
that that statutory limit [regarding the requirement in
for the Minister to reach a state of satisfaction as to the public
interest] on its own is not sufficient to ensure that in all of
the potential
operations of
, there would be compliance with the implied freedom."
For instance, the breadth of the power in
for the Minister to
determine a scheme, together with the great latitude afforded to the Minister in
determining the content of the
scheme, might purport to authorise a scheme that
placed limits on political activity or political donations by the C&G
or any of its officers which did not comply with the implied freedom of
political communication.
the relevant question in this special case appears to ask whether the
Legislative Amendments are invalid in any of their
applications, the question
should not be understood so broadly. In
Palmer v Western
Gageler J and I considered that where an open-textured provision is
challenged, the appropriate course is to adjudicate upon the
application of the provision (here, the Determination) rather than to attempt to
adjudicate upon a range of hypothetical
circumstances in which the provision
might be applied, the universe of such hypothetical circumstances being as wide
as the judicial
imagination permits: "[i]t is enough to conclude that the
provisions can be 'disapplied'" from any invalid
application.
the judicial imagination is a notoriously limited thing when compared with the
infinite variety and spice of human endeavour.
In this case, for instance, the
parties did not attempt to canvass the vast range of possible schemes that could
be the subject of
a determination under
Only limited examples were
given by the plaintiffs, such as the possibility that a scheme could be declared
without the Minister
being satisfied that the C&G Division is not
functioning lawfully or effectively.
plaintiffs properly accepted that it is generally inappropriate for a court to
attempt to adjudicate upon all applications of
an open-textured provision and
that the validity of the Determination in this case "converges" with the
constitutional question.
But the plaintiffs argued that it was necessary to
adjudicate on all applications in this case because partial disapplication in
relation to hypothetical
schemes would be impossible given that so
much of the activity of the C&G Division is political. That submission
should not be
accepted. The Determination is a particular application of the
. The extent of the C&G Division's
political activities bears upon the justification of
application by the Determination. It is unnecessary to consider how those
political activities might affect the justification
applications. If some other application of
arose, by a new
determination, and
was invalid in that application then it could be
partially disapplied by
Acts Interpretation Act
separate question in this special case concerning the Determination assumes,
validity of the Determination depends upon the legislative authority for it.
Since there was no suggestion that the Determination
fell outside the scope of
of Ch 11 of the
, the validity of the Determination
turns upon the same question: whether
is contrary to the implied
freedom of political communication. For this reason, evidence of the actual
manner in which the Administrator
has exercised his powers, upon which
Mr Hiscox (an officeholder of the C&G Division who has not been removed
from office but
who is subject to the direction of the Administrator),
intervening, sought to rely in this Court, might be relevant to administrative
law issues about whether those exercises were within statutory power but such
evidence is not relevant to the questions addressed
to this Court.
(iii) The Legislative Amendments and Determination impose a
burden on free political communication
Legislative Amendments impose a burden upon the freedom of political
communication which can be assessed by reference to dimensions
of depth and
width. The depth of a burden concerns the intensity or focus of the effect of a
law in constraining free political communication.
The width of a burden concerns
the extent of the conduct which is constrained, including the number of people
affected and the time
and place where they are
to the two matters of mitigation discussed below, the burden imposed by the
Legislative Amendments is both deep and wide.
As the special case describes, the
C&G Division, through its officers, is heavily involved in politics. In the
financial year
ended 31 March 2023, the Victoria-Tasmania Divisional Branch
of the C&G Division paid $151,037 in affiliation fees to the Australian
Labor Party, and a further $2,356 in affiliation fees to that Party's Tasmanian
State branch. The C&G Divisional Secretary and
C&G Divisional Branch
Secretaries have lobbied politicians and political parties, conducted campaigns
and held rallies, building
up political connections through their offices, and
communicating their activities to their members. Recent C&G Division and
C&G Divisional Branch campaigns include advocating for the criminalisation
of industrial manslaughter, prohibition of the use,
importation, and manufacture
of engineered stone, the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction
Commission and the Building
Code, management of the housing crisis through
increased taxation of corporate profits, and the securing of Australian jobs.
were 292 offices, identified in Annexure B of the Determination, that were
"vacated for the duration of the administration"
by cl 3(1)(a) of
Annexure A of the Determination. Those offices included "members of the
Divisional Executive, Divisional Conference,
Divisional Trustees, Divisional
Branch Committee of Management, Divisional Branch Council and Divisional Branch
Trustees". In purely
formal terms, those former officers, and the members they
represented, remain free to engage in political activity either individually
in association with each other. But the practical reality of the removal of 292
offices is the removal of the incumbents' political
platform, the blunting of
their political connections, and the stifling of their ability to exploit their
political know-how and
expertise born from lobbying and campaigning. Thus, as
Mr Hiscox submitted, the power to remove officeholders from their offices
stifles the ability of those officeholders to participate in political matters
that affect the interests of members. Individually,
such former officeholders
retain their liberty to speak. But the megaphone of their office is removed. So
too, for the reasons below,
do the Legislative Amendments remove those aspects
of political influence that the former officeholders wielded by virtue of their
ability to access the organisational purse.
Section 323K(1)
gives the Administrator control over the property of the C&G
Division, including the ability to manage and dispose of that property.
Consistent with
, cl 6(1)(a) of Annexure A of the
Determination gives the Administrator the powers and duties of the C&G
Divisional Conference
and the C&G Divisional Executive. The Divisional
Conference is the supreme governing body of the C&G Division, with powers
that include spending such funds (held by the CFMEU as the only legal entity) as
are necessary to carry out the objects of the CFMEU
as they relate to the
C&G Division
reviewing the expenditure of the C&G Divisional
Clause 6(1)(b) gives the Administrator the same powers and duties of the
C&G Divisional Branch Council and the C&G Divisional
Branch Management
therefore, the Determination grants the Administrator the exclusive trust power,

over funds that are held on trust by
the CFMEU for the members of the C&G
the depth and width of the burden upon free political communication imposed by
, in its application by the Determination, are mitigated in two
significant respects by two obligations imposed by
those obligations is removed or reduced by the provision in
any action taken under a scheme will "have effect despite anything in [the
]". An action that is validated under
must be "under [a]
scheme" and the content of a scheme under
must be consistent with
the obligations of the Administrator under
The two obligations
that mitigate the depth and width of the burden are as follows.
s 323K(5)(a)
requires the Administrator to be satisfied
that he is acting in the best interests of the members of the C&G Division
branches. That obligation necessarily includes when the Administrator
takes any action to amend the C&G Division Rules or to
use any property of
the C&G Division, defined in s 323K(6) as "property of the CFMEU that,
immediately before [the Legislative
Amendments] commenced, was solely or
predominantly used for the benefit or the purposes of the [C&G] Division or
any of its branches".
In other words, in exercising the trust powers that the
Administrator has over CFMEU property that is held on trust for the C&G
Division members, the Administrator must be satisfied that he is acting in the
best interests of those members. The best interests
of the members are most
clearly determined by reference to the C&G Division Rules at the time of the
Determination. Indeed, as
Beech‑Jones J observes, in exercising those
powers the Administrator may also be subject to fiduciary duties. It is
unnecessary
to decide whether any such duties in equity are displaced by the
s 323K(5) duty for the Administrator to be satisfied that he is
the best interests of members of the C&G Division.
s 323K(5)(b) requires the Administrator to "have regard to the objects of
the CFMEU as defined in the rules of the CFMEU
at the commencement of [the
administration], so far as they are lawful". The numerous objects (which are
also objects of the C&G
Division) include, in broad terms, "to improve,
protect, and foster the best interests of the [CFMEU]", raising political levies
and donating to and affiliating with political parties, securing and assisting
in securing various legislation, doing "all things
conducive to the welfare and
organisation of the working class", and protecting members "from any
infringement of their
(iv) The purpose of the Legislative Amendments is
motives of some legislators, and the foreseeable effects and intended means of
application of the Legislative Amendments, may
have been to impose a burden on
free political communication. But, as has been explained in detail above, the
purpose of legislation
is distinct from motives, means, and foreseeable effects.
The purpose of the Legislative Amendments was to enable the C&G Division
be returned to lawful operation in its members' interests in an effective,
efficient, and accountable
The purpose
was not to burden the freedom of political communication. The purpose is
legitimate.
(v) The burden imposed is proportionate
(a) Suitability of the legislative means: rational connection with
purpose is objectively determined, and since the legislative means adopted will
be an important part of the interpretation
of legislative purpose, it is hard to
conceive how legislative means could not be rationally connected with any
objective purpose
that is properly identified by "ordinary processes of
interpretation, including considering the meanings of statutory words in the
provision, meanings of other provisions in the statute, the historical
background to the provision, and any apparent social
objective".
a rare case where a law exists with no purpose ascertainable at any level of
generality higher than the meaning of the
law itself, the effect of the law will
itself be the purpose.
Legislative Amendments are suitable in the sense that they are rationally
connected to their purpose of enabling the C&G
Division to be returned to
lawful operation in its members' interests in an effective, efficient, and
accountable manner.
(b) Reasonable necessity of the legislative
issue focuses upon whether there is an obvious and compelling alternative means,
which is at least as effective but with a significantly
lesser impact upon
freedom of political communication than the Legislative Amendments, for
Parliament to return the C&G Division
to lawful operation in its members'
interests in an effective, efficient, and accountable manner. The plaintiffs and
Mr Hiscox did
not identify any means short of some form of administration
that would be at least as effective, "quantitatively, qualitatively,
probability-wise".
That approach was correct. The extent of both the findings of legal
contraventions and the allegations of corruption and other lawlessness
in the opening of these reasons was such that any means short of administration
would not have been as effective.
plaintiffs and Mr Hiscox submitted, however, that an equally effective
means of achieving the same purpose, with a less restrictive
effect on the
freedom of political communication, would be for the administration to take
place under the pre-existing
. Indeed, on
2 August 2024, three weeks before the Determination, the General Manager of
the Fair Work Commission had applied to the
Federal Court of Australia for
declarations and orders under
, including an order
approving a scheme in relation to the C&G Division and some of its
Divisional Branches on the basis, required
that the C&G Division and its branches had ceased to function effectively
and there were no effective means under the rules
of the CFMEU by which they
could be enabled to function effectively.
submissions of the plaintiffs and Mr Hiscox should not be accepted for two
reasons. First, a scheme of administration under
would not be at
least as effective to achieve that part of Parliament's legitimate purpose which
is concerned with returning the
C&G Division to lawful operation in its
members' interests in an efficient manner. As rapidly as the Federal Court might
operated to determine the General Manager's application under
there was substantial evidence to be filed, written submissions to be made, a
hearing to be allocated and undertaken, issues to
be considered, and reasons to
be prepared. As the Commonwealth and the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth
submitted, there may
even have been questions concerning the power of the Court
to appoint an external administrator when approving a scheme under
"for the taking of action by a collective body
of the organisation
by an officer or officers
of the organisation
" (emphasis
By contrast,
the Determination was instant and immediate and not subject to the legal doubt

might arguably permit schemes that impose greater
restrictions upon the implied freedom of political communication than the scheme
that is the subject of the Determination, for the reasons explained
the appropriate
manner to assess the validity of the Legislative Amendments is by reference to
their application in the scheme that
is the subject of the Determination. The
constraints under
upon the scheme that is the subject of the
Determination, including the preservation of the objects of the CFMEU and the
requirement
for the Administrator to act in the best interests of the C&G
Division members, are at least as restrictive as the constraint
that the "Court must not make an order ... unless it is satisfied
that the order would not do substantial injustice to the organisation
member of the organisation".
is true, as Mr Hiscox submitted, that the Federal Court might have approved
a scheme that excluded the ACT Divisional Branch of
the C&G Division, which
had not been included in the application by the General Manager and whose
officers had been subject to
very few findings of contravention. But it is
neither obvious nor compelling that such a scheme would have been as effective.
ACT Divisional Branch is not autonomous from the other branches of the
C&G Division. All branches are governed by the C&G
Divisional Conference
as a "supreme governing body". Further, the C&G Divisional Executive is a
common executive to all branches
and officeholders. The special case describes
officeholders of each of the C&G Divisional Conference and the C&G
Executive as having contravened industrial laws.
Adequacy of the legislative scheme in the balance
and the plaintiffs characterised Parliament's response to officers of the
C&G Division's contraventions of industrial
laws and the allegations of
further wrongdoing in strong terms. Mr Hiscox characterised Parliament's
response as "draconian". The
plaintiffs pointed to the "unthinkable" notion
"while in administration, the [C&G Division] should be unable to participate
in debate, say, about the very laws that permit
the administration ... to use
[C&G Division] money to argue against the law that brought about this
position and to seek punishment
at the ballot box for those who sponsored it ...
[It] is an extraordinary proposition made all the more galling because [C&G
Division] money will be used to defray the expenses of the administration".
That submission is only softened slightly by the ability of former
officeholders to participate in debate without the power and authority
office and by the obligation of the Administrator to use his trust power over
funds held for the benefit of the C&G
Division members in the best interests
of those members.
Parliament's
policy decision to place one of the three divisions of the CFMEU into
administration was a forceful response to contraventions
of industrial laws by
officers of that division and allegations of their misconduct, with a deep and
wide impact upon the freedom
of political communication, albeit an impact that
is mitigated in two significant respects. But to conclude that this response was
inadequate in the balance involves saying that the
Constitution
Parliament from making a policy decision that is reasonably necessary (or,
perhaps more accurately, reasonably capable
of being seen as necessary) to
implement its legitimate purpose because the importance of Parliament's policy
objective is outweighed
in the balance by the importance of free political
communication.
a conclusion is difficult for a court to reach in ordinary circumstances. The
principles of representative and responsible government,
which underpin the
implied freedom of political communication, require that Parliament have the
power to make policy decisions as
the representative of the Australian people.
And the difficulty of reaching this conclusion becomes an impossibility when the
of Parliament that is said to be outweighed by free political
communication is concerned with responding to repeated breaches of
the law and
serious allegations of corruption and violence as set out
(vi) Conclusion
Legislative Amendments, in their application by the Determination, are not
inconsistent with the implied freedom of political
communication.
VI. Chapter III of the
Constitution
: non-judicial
(i) The issue
the plaintiffs' question concerning Ch III of the
Constitution
expressed by reference to the Legislative Amendments generally, the focus of
their submissions was only upon the power of the
Minister in
to determine a scheme dealing with the property held on trust for the
members of the C&G Division and the power in
Administrator to control the property of the CFMEU that is held for the benefit
of the C&G Division. The submissions
of the plaintiffs oscillated between
treating the effect of
as conferring the judicial power to
punish on the Executive and conferring that power on the legislature.
is unnecessary to determine whether any penalty imposed by
, or by the exercise of powers under those provisions, should be
characterised as either or both of: (i) executive punishment; or
(ii) legislative punishment in substance amounting to a bill of attainder,
or formerly a bill of pains and
event, if the plaintiffs are correct that
punishment for breach of a rule of conduct then those provisions, and the
balance of the Legislative Amendments which depend
upon them, are invalid. It
was not suggested that if
were punitive then either
provision could fall within any historical circumstance of

Constitution

(ii) The test and the fiction
present test for whether a legislative measure is punitive is that adopted by a
majority of this Court in
YBFZ v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and
Multicultural
and developing another recent
that the test for whether legislative means are punitive involves two stages.
The first stage asks whether the means used
by Parliament are "prima facie
punitive ... (by default or otherwise)"; if so, then, at the second stage, those
means will be punitive
unless they are "reasonably capable of being seen to be
necessary (in the relevant sense of 'reasonably appropriate and adapted'
for a legitimate and non-punitive
a matter of precedent, unless there were compelling reasons to depart from it, I
should endeavour to make the best sense of, and
to apply, the test supported by
a majority of this Court in
YBFZ v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and
Multicultural Affairs
for whether legislative means are punishment. But with
great respect, the state of the present jurisprudence concerning the concept
punishment in Ch III of the
Constitution
is extremely difficult to
understand or apply and involves a legal fiction. The test is essentially that a
legislative means is "punitive"
if it is prima facie punitive, unless a court
concludes that it is not punitive because it is not for a punitive purpose.
difficulty to understand or apply the test arises because the meaning of
"punitive" changes in the different places it is used
in the test. At the stage
of asking whether a legislative means is "prima facie punitive", the notion of
punishment seems to mean
that the means will involve some significant
interference with "basic rights" such as "liberty or bodily
integrity".
it is apparently accepted that "in the protection of bodily integrity, the law
'cannot draw the line between different degrees
of violence, and therefore
totally prohibits the first and lowest stage of it
this is said
not to be the case with a "prima facie punitive" measure under the
Constitution
. It is said that "[t]here are many interferences with bodily
integrity and liberty authorised by the legislature, both significant
insignificant, which are
non-punitive".
event, however one assesses whichever significant interferences with bodily
integrity and liberty are prima facie punitive,
there appears to be no role for
considerations almost universally associated with punishment, such as
retribution and deterrence.
contrast, the "prima facie" conclusion that a legislative means is punitive will
be confirmed if the legislative means is not
proportionate to a legitimate
purpose ("reasonably capable of being seen to be necessary (in the relevant
sense of 'reasonably appropriate
and adapted' ...) for a legitimate and
non-punitive
). Although it
seems that when asking whether the purpose is "punitive" the true sense of
punitive is applied (since a punitive measure
is one imposed for the purposes of
proportionality testing fictitiously deems those means which are not punitive,
because they have no punitive purpose, nevertheless
to be punitive. As I

of a legitimate purpose necessarily amount

The parties' and interveners' attempts to apply the
plaintiffs understandably seized upon the confused state of the present
jurisprudence concerning the concept of "punishment"
Constitution
They submitted that a person's right to property is a fundamental right and that
deprivation of property by forfeiture has historically
been used as a form of
punishment. Similar arguments were made about the imposition of disabilities and
disqualifications upon persons
in their employment. The plaintiffs submitted
that these measures were not reasonably necessary means for a legitimate

significant interferences with basic rights were to be deemed to be "prima facie
punitive ... (by default or
otherwise)",
would be difficult to see why those basic rights would not include a right to
property. The right to private property has
been regarded as a fundamental right
for centuries.
a person's fundamental right to private property has even been suggested to be
capable in some circumstances of prevailing
over another's fundamental right to
bodily integrity.
Further, the plaintiffs are correct that forfeiture of property for punitive
purposes has long historical antecedents as a form of
genuine (and not deemed)
punishment.
case, therefore, it would be difficult to see why the forfeiture of the use of
assets held for a person's benefit, or the
deprivation of a person's office or
employment, and potentially their livelihood ("usually one of the most important
things in [a
), would not be
sufficiently serious interferences with a basic right even if these deprivations

contrast, the Commonwealth, the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, and the
Attorney-General of Queensland (intervening) submitted,
with strict and literal
fidelity to the reasoning of the joint judgment in
YBFZ v Minister for
Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs
, that measures that are
"prima facie punitive" include only interferences with bodily integrity
(including human life) or liberty.
The Commonwealth and the Attorney-General of
the Commonwealth correctly submitted that if a legislative means were to amount
to punishment
by interference with property rights, independently of the true
purposes of punishment (generally purposes of retribution for, but
deterrence of, a breach of rules of
), then the
Constitution
would have introduced, by implication, a different test for
justification than that expressly required by
s 51(xxxi).
In my view, that
powerful submission does not support drawing lines between some constitutionally
protected basic rights and others.
Rather, the submission reinforces the
difficulty with fictitious notions of
punishment.
(iv) The test should be preserved but stripped of
difficulties and confusion that surround the application of the test in
v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs
avoided whilst maintaining fidelity to central aspects of the reasoning of the
joint judgment in that case by applying the
test for validity proposed by that
judgment stripped of fictions associated with notions of deemed punishment as
part of a head of
power analysis. The only part of the test which applies to the
Ch III question of whether a legislative means falls within the exclusively
judicial power to punish should therefore be whether a purpose of the law is
punitive (in a real sense). If no purpose of the law
is punitive, then the law
is not a law for the purposes of
punishment.
aspects of the test—whether the law involves an interference with a
fundamental right and whether the legislative
means are proportionate to
(reasonably capable of being seen to be necessary for) a legitimate
purpose—are matters relevant
to an assessment of whether the law is within
a head of power, as explained earlier in these reasons.
assessing whether a law is made for a punitive purpose, the harshness of the
effect of the law can sometimes suggest that the
law is made for core purposes
of punishment, to sanction and impose retribution for, but also to deter,
proscribed conduct.
But the harshness of an effect does not by itself make a legislative purpose

That purpose

those officers for the benefit of members. But the purpose is one that remains

with regulating a state of affairs rather than imposing a

given which demonstrate the non-punitive nature

in: the suspension of a liquidator's registration involving regulation "by

corporation;
cancellation of a broadcasting licence for offences that breach conditions of

the detailed complaints procedure that

only with illegality, but with standards of propriety generally, in the
investigation of "improper,
unlawful or criminal" conduct by a range of people
associated with the C&G
suggests any purpose of retribution, anything analogous to a purpose
of retribution, or even any ancillary purpose of punishment
such as deterrence.
VII. Acquisition of property:
Constitution
final issue concerns whether any of the Legislative Amendments are invalid
because they are laws authorising the acquisition
of property otherwise than on
just terms within the meaning of
Constitution
plaintiffs' submissions focused upon s 323K and s 323M separately. As
to s 323K, the plaintiffs asserted that the Administrator's
control over
"property ... of the [C&G] Division and its branches" by s 323K
amounted to an acquisition of property within
, even though the
same could not be said of other administrations. As to s 323M, the
plaintiffs submitted that this provision effected
an acquisition of property by
creating the Administrator's entitlement "to receive remuneration for necessary
work properly performed
by the administrator in relation to the
administration"
"remuneration ... to be paid from the funds of the
plaintiffs face obstacles in their submissions that s 323K(1) effects an
"acquisition" of property. The plaintiffs did not suggest
that any equitable
rights of the members of the C&G Division were acquired. The assets held on
trust for those members by the
CFMEU are controlled and managed by the
Administrator, who must, at least, be satisfied that his actions are taken in
the best interests
of the C&G Division members. The property which the
plaintiffs assert has been acquired under s 323K must therefore be the
power of the CFMEU in relation to the assets that it holds on trust for
the members of the C&G Division. The effect of s 323K(1),
as explained
is to vest that
trust power in the Administrator. But there may be difficulties in seeing the
Administrator's duty to exercise a
trust power as
"property".
plaintiffs also face obstacles in their submissions that s 323M effects an
"acquisition" of property by remunerating the Administrator
from CFMEU funds for
work done for the benefit of the C&G Division. The property that the
plaintiffs contend has been acquired
by s 323M must be the legal right of
the CFMEU to money held for the benefit of C&G Division members that is paid
to the Administrator
for his services as "a necessary or characteristic feature
of the means which the law selects to achieve its
objective".
obstacles can be put to one side because even if s 323K and s 323M
effect an acquisition of property within
, s 323S(1)
provides for the Commonwealth to be "liable to pay a reasonable amount of
compensation". Although this Court has sometimes
considered it appropriate to
determine whether there was an acquisition of property despite the presence of
such a clause,
appropriate to resolve this issue in the special case on a confined basis for
three reasons. First, this issue was not at the
forefront of the special case.
Secondly, the Administrator's property under s 323K (which would seem to be
in the nature of a duty
to exercise a trust power) was not the subject of
substantial submissions; indeed, it was only acknowledged briefly in oral
submissions
that the Administrator's rights under s 323K are in relation to
a trust fund. Thirdly, s 323S provides a complete answer to the plaintiffs'
submissions on this issue.
323S(1) provides as follows:
"If the operation of [Pt 2A or the Determination] would result in an acquisition
of property (within the meaning of paragraph 51(xxxi)
Constitution
from a person otherwise than on just terms (within the meaning of that
paragraph), the Commonwealth is liable to pay a reasonable
compensation to the person."
Section 323S(2) provides that if the Commonwealth and the person do not agree
on the amount of compensation, then the person may institute
proceedings to have
the amount determined by a specified court.
the introduction of
Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976
ubiquitous clauses in forms similar to this "well-recognised and preferable
included in Commonwealth legislation, with these clauses preventing such
legislation being found to be invalid due to
Constitution
The plaintiffs did not deny that payment of a reasonable amount of
compensation for any acquisition of property under s 323K or s
would be "just terms". Instead, the plaintiffs argued that any compensation
would be payable to the CFMEU and allocated under
the CFMEU Rules to the C&G
s 323K(1), would be controlled by the Administrator, thus creating a
requirement for further compensation. Section 323S
was therefore said by
the plaintiffs to be a "snake eating its own tail".
simple answer to the plaintiffs' submissions is that if s 323K or
s 323M did cause property to be acquired within the meaning
s 51(xxxi), then any court order for compensation to be paid to the CFMEU
under s 323S would not be property under the control
or management of the
Administrator within s 323K(6). In other words, the court order for
compensation would not be "property of the
CFMEU that,
immediately before
[the Legislative Amendments] commenced
, was solely or predominantly used for
the benefit or the purposes of the [C&G] Division or any of its branches"
(emphasis added).
In any event, any court order could be framed so that the
compensation paid to the CFMEU under s 323S did not form part of the funds
under the control or management of the Administrator within s 323K,
requiring further compensation in the same amount and defeating
the object of
s 323S, as the snake devours its tail.
VIII. Conclusion
questions should be answered as proposed by Gordon J.
Subject to what follows, I respectfully agree with the reasons of
Gordon J and adopt her Honour's description of the facts.
I also agree
with each of the answers proposed by Gordon J to the questions stated by
the parties in the special case. In particular,
I especially agree with her
Honour's reasons concerning the correct and orthodox discernment of legislative
intent and the proper
use of extrinsic materials. I also agree with her
Honour's statement of the purpose of the impugned provisions. There is nothing
I can say which might usefully add to these aspects of her Honour's
reasoning, save that it is unnecessary for me to adopt any part
of those reasons
concerning whether the impugned provisions have a purpose which is legitimate
and which justifies any burden they
may impose. That is because the impugned
provisions do not burden the so-called implied freedom of political
communication.
also respectfully and generally agree with the reasons and conclusion of
Edelman J on the issue of discerning legislative intent
and concerning the
purpose of the impugned provisions here.
The implied freedom of
political communication
is now time to speak again about the implied freedom of political communication.
LibertyWorks Inc v The
Commonwealth
more recently in
Babet v The
Commonwealth
I doubted whether the
Constitution
supports such an
implication.
the reason for that was the division of opinion amongst members of this Court
concerning the content of the test for the
justification of a law which
otherwise burdens the implied freedom of political
communication.
division seriously undermines any suggestion that the implication in question
is, by reason of the structure of the
Constitution
, "logically or
practically
necessary".
the division has changed
and has worsened. These various tests of justification have been developed, not
really because they are
"'securely based' in the text
structure of
Constitution
but because there is a need for pragmatic controllers of an implication that is
otherwise, for the reasons given below, too broad,
ungainly and
uncontrollable.
Its breadth is problematic
is now clear to me that the implied freedom is too broad and has only become
governable through the various doctrines of judicial
justification that the
Court deploys. I thus not only retain serious doubts about its cogency but
am now convinced that it is very
wrong. Given the vast scope of its application,
it is just not sustainable.
contrast, one of the useful attributes of other, more narrow, constitutional
implications is that they are sometimes so self-evident
that they do not need to
be kept in check with any doctrine of justification (or such a need is much
diminished). A narrow implication
of this kind may speak for itself, and its
utility may be apparent to all. Narrow implications from ss 7 and
Constitution
, which ensure that our legislative representatives are
"directly chosen by the people", illustrate the point. One of them was recently
affirmed by this Court in
Ruddick v The
Commonwealth
that case, Gordon, Edelman and Gleeson JJ (with whom I relevantly
) said of the
requirement of
"The constraint implied by the requirement of choice is that the people must
have the ability to make an informed choice, which restricts
Parliament's
ability to constrain the extent to which the people can 'convey and receive
opinions, arguments and information concerning
matter intended or likely to
affect voting'."
is curious that the
implication is so constrained given this
Court's jurisprudence concerning the implied freedom. The
implication protects only the "bare foundations, of the electoral
and reserves
to the Parliament a "wide leeway of choice" to pass laws concerning all aspects
of the electoral process, including
"the fundamental features of the operation
of elections".
Court's deference here to the will of the people, as expressed through its
representatives, on matters that very much more directly
affect the democratic
choice guaranteed by ss 7 and
Constitution
is really at
odds with the ongoing march of the implied freedom.
Constitution
might also conceivably justify other,
analogous, implications about the quality and integrity of the electoral
process, but only
for a defined period – namely, from the time when an
election is called to the time of the declaration of the poll. In
Capital Television Pty Ltd v The
Commonwealth
McHugh J proposed such an implication concerning the electoral process. His
Honour said:
"The process includes all those steps which are directed to the people electing
their representatives – nominating, campaigning,
advertising, debating,
criticizing and voting. In respect of such steps, the people possess the right
to participate, the right to
associate and the right to communicate. That means
that, subject to necessary exceptions, the people have a constitutional right
convey and receive opinions, arguments and information concerning matter
intended or likely to affect voting".
even outside of the electoral process it must be accepted that politics touches,
whether directly or indirectly, upon so many
diverse issues; it is a boundless
field of discourse. Any law which burdens, howsoever lightly, that vast field of
political communication
potentially presently triggers an application of the
implied freedom.
is the enormous scale of what constitutes political communication which is the
problem with the current implication. It is just
too broad. That can be seen in
this very case. The appointment of a temporary administrator to a union to
address perceived abuses
of the law – something which, if true, is
self-evidently a good thing – is nonetheless said to offend the implied
As Gordon J so rightly observes, if that be correct, then a
question would arise as to whether any appointment of a liquidator, receiver,
administrator would infringe the implied
ever-expanding reach of the implied freedom can be seen in the work of this
Court over recent years. That work reveals an inexorable
feature; namely a
direct focus in debate on whether the impugned law is justified, with the burden

trend was discerned by Heydon J over ten years ago and prior to any of the
above authorities. In
Wotton v Queensland
, his Honour
"Indeed it is often conceded or assumed by those defending validity that the
party challenging validity has satisfied the first limb
This common practice of concession or assumption that the first
limb is met tends to generate an insidious belief that it will always be met."
me, Heydon J went on to observe that this trend meant that the second limb
– being that of justification – had thereby assumed
much greater prominence in the jurisprudence of this Court and had
led to "sharp
divisions". His Honour
"To construe the first
limb in such a way that there will always or
almost always be a burden, so that the proponent of legislative validity will
or almost always have to fall back on the second limb, is to bring into
play indeterminate considerations and render them crucial
in every or almost
every case. Those considerations are capable of being applied by each particular
judge in a different way. They
are considerations which tend to lead to sharp
divisions of judicial opinion, with cases being decided by the reasoning of a
majority or by majority agreement on the orders but not the reasoning that
leads to them."
there are many who may think that there is much to admire about an implied
freedom with this breadth of application. There
are no doubt many who would say
that such a guarantee of freedom enhances and protects our democratic
institutions. But the merits
of the implication are not what matters. What
matters is whether it is necessarily mandated by the
Constitution
document which contains no equivalent to the language of freedom of speech found
in the First Amendment to the
Constitution
of the United States
respect, Australia took a different course from the United States of America.
Australia preferred to rely upon the vigilance
of its people as the best
guarantee of freedom and democracy, rather than embrace the power of a benign
directorate, no matter how
beguilingly attractive that might be. As
Dawson J observed in
Australian Capital
"[T]he Australian
Constitution
, with few exceptions and in contrast with its
American model, does not seek to establish personal liberty by constitutional
restrictions
upon the exercise of governmental power. The choice was deliberate
and based upon a faith in the democratic process to protect Australian
against unwarranted incursions upon the freedoms which they enjoy. ...
Thus the Australian
Constitution
, unlike the
Constitution
of the United
States, does little to confer upon individuals by way of positive rights those
basic freedoms which exist in a free
and democratic society. They exist, not
because they are provided for, but in the absence of any curtailment of them.
speech, for example, which is guaranteed in the United States by the
First Amendment to the
Constitution
, is a concept which finds no expression in
Constitution
, notwithstanding that it is as much the foundation of a free
society here as it is there. The right to freedom of speech exists here
there is nothing to prevent its exercise and because governments recognize that
if they attempt to limit it, save in accepted
areas such as defamation or
sedition, they must do so at their peril. Not only that, but courts recognize
the importance of the basic
immunities and require the clearest expression of
intention before construing legislation in such a way as to interfere with them.
The fact, however, remains that in this country the guarantee of fundamental
freedoms does not lie in any constitutional mandate
but in the capacity of a
democratic society to preserve for itself its own shared values."
capacity of a democratic society to preserve for itself its own shared values
explains why our democratic institutions were able
to thrive for so long without
the implied freedom. In that sense the implied freedom is a remedy that we have
never really needed;
it is a constitutional device designed to battle imaginary
demons. As Heydon J observed in
Monis v The
is sometimes suggested that even if the implied freedom did not originally exist
– which it did not – it was necessary
to invent it in order to
ensure that representative democracy operated properly. It is hard to agree in
view of the more than satisfactory
operation of representative and responsible
democracy in Australia for fifty years before Federation, and then for the
period, more
than ninety years long, between Federation and the invention of the
implied freedom."
is simply no evidence to support a need for a textual or structural implication
any broader than that so recently confirmed
concerning the
need for an informed choice in elections. That narrower implication is all that
The tests of justification are too unclear
the implication is engaged whenever the freedom of political communication is
burdened, it needs to be controlled to prevent
the invalidation of laws where
the burden is justified. But this Court has two competing tests of justification
and both suffer,
with respect, from a lack of rigour and clarity.
traditional test considers whether the purpose of the impugned law is
legitimate, in the sense that it is consistent with the
maintenance of the
constitutionally prescribed system of government, and also considers whether the
impugned provisions are reasonably
appropriate and adapted to advance that
legitimate purpose in a manner consistent with the maintenance of the
constitutionally prescribed
government.
other test, called structured proportionality, asks the following questions and
does so in a particular
"1. Does the law effectively burden the implied freedom in its terms, operation
'yes' to question 1, is the purpose of the law legitimate, in the sense that it
is compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally
prescribed system of
representative and responsible government?
'yes' to question 2, is the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to advance
that legitimate object in a manner that is compatible
with the maintenance of
the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible
government?
The third step ... is assisted by a proportionality
analysis which asks whether the impugned law is 'suitable', in the sense that
has a rational connection to the purpose of the law, and 'necessary', in the
sense that there is no obvious and compelling alternative,
reasonably practical,
means of achieving the same purpose which has a less burdensome effect on the
implied freedom. If both these
questions are answered in the affirmative, the
question is then whether the challenged law is 'adequate in its balance'. This
criterion requires a judgment, consistently with the limits of the judicial
function, as to the balance between the importance of
the purpose served by the
law and the extent of the restriction it imposes on the implied freedom."
tests of justification rest upon insufficiently defined concepts. What, for
example, is meant by a "constitutionally prescribed
system of government"? That
may be difficult to delineate given that this Court accepts that such a system
of government may assume
many diverse forms and that Parliament may legitimately
choose one of them and reject
concepts of suitability, necessity and adequacy all
require the formation of a judgment which can sometimes compel the making of
choices about the merit of the law being impugned; and then to do so
often without the Court having the evidence before it to perform
adequately (assuming that this is possible). For example, in
Unions NSW v New
South Wales
implied freedom was invoked to impugn
Electoral Funding
(NSW). That obliged the Court, in practical terms, to answer the
following question: was $20,000 (indexed for inflation) a sufficiently
reasonable amount to permit a third-party campaigner to run a campaign in a
by-election for an electoral district in the Legislative
Assembly of New South
Wales? But the materials before the Court simply did not establish whether or
not $20,000 was a reasonable
received no expert evidence about this issue.
competing test of structured proportionality at least seeks to introduce a
measure of transparency and rationality. But even
so, and as already mentioned,
the words "suitable", "necessary" and
highly abstract concepts which lack sufficient precision, and which thereby
promote uncertainty.
Consistently
with my view that the implication in favour of freedom of political
communication is very hard to sustain, the test
of structured proportionality,
which had enjoyed the support of a majority of this Court for ten years, was
recently qualified by
a differently constituted majority in
now only an optional "tool of analysis". When this option must be exercised is
entirely unclear. Moreover, this Court in
did not favour a variety
of tests for justification. All their Honours said was, "[i]n the context of the
questions raised by the
case stated" there was no need in that case to
distinguish between different concepts of
justification.
am not the first to be concerned with the unconfined generality of the implied
freedom. It was noted by Heydon J in
implied freedom of political communication has never been clear. If there were a
federal bill of rights, the implied freedom
of communication about government
and political matters would be listed. 'Bills of rights are not moral or even
political philosophies.
They are, at best, bullet points from such
philosophies'. Like other philosophical bullet points, the unclarity of the
implied freedom
gives the courts virtually untrammelled power to make of it what
each judge wills."
respectfully agree with the foregoing. The lack of clarity in the implied
freedom makes it especially difficult for legislative
drafters, the government
and the people to know with any confidence whether a law is constitutionally
valid – in the sense
that, if that law arguably burdens the implied
freedom of political communication, it may otherwise be sufficiently justified,
only by reference to a standard measured by judges and no-one else. Resort
to highly generalised and abstract tests as constitutional
principles leaves to
the judge far too much discretion to decide what is valid and what is not. The
implied freedom is thus fundamentally
inutile as a rule of law. That is because
purely abstract propositions are an anathema to a country that is supposed to be
A judge's duty
I consider that the implied freedom of political communication accepted by this
Court cannot be justified by reference to the
text and structure of the
Constitution
. It is perhaps not even needed to ensure that representative
democracy operates properly. But a majority of this Court accepts its
and has done so for nearly 30 years. The following observation of

party or intervener sought to argue that
should be reconsidered.
That may not relieve me of the necessity, if I am conscientiously of the view
that it, as a decision of this
Court, no matter that it be recent and unanimous,
is incompatible with the
Constitution
, of deciding whether I am bound not to
follow it, rather than obliged to apply it. I will proceed for present purposes
however upon
the basis that
accords with the
Constitution
I am obliged to apply it."
in the present matter, no party sought to dispute the existence of the implied
freedom of political communication, and I,
like Callinan J, am also obliged
to apply it. It was on that basis that in both
LibertyWorks
I faithfully applied the implied freedom doctrine. Here I likewise
apply the implied freedom doctrine by gratefully agreeing with
Gordon J's reasons on that topic in this special case (save for her
Honour's reasons concerning justification). But that said,
as I explained in
LibertyWorks
and for the foregoing reasons, a reconsideration (with leave if necessary) of
the implied freedom's existence may be justified and
a matter for full argument
on another occasion.
foregoing is an orthodox and settled expression of the duty of a judge of this
Court when confronted with a doctrine of law which
that judge is strongly
convinced to be fundamentally wrong. It follows – with much regret on my
part, but nonetheless with
exactitude – the approach of Gibbs J in

have long exercised a power to appoint administrators, receivers and
liquidators.
executive branch may also do so. An obvious example of a power to appoint an
administrator which is exercisable by the executive
branch is the Australian
Securities and Investments Commission's ability to wind up a
power of relative antiquity. For example, a similar power existed in s 295
Companies Act 1929
(UK) (exercisable by the registrar of
companies).
Section 295
was considered by this Court in
Adelaide Company
of Jehovah's Witnesses Inc v The
Commonwealth.
That case concerned a power conferred on the Governor-General by the
National Security (Subversive Associations) Regulations
(Cth) to take
control of, and then dissolve, certain private organisations. A contention that
the regulations impinged upon the judicial
power of the Commonwealth in
contravention of
Constitution
was rejected by each of
Latham CJ, Starke and McTiernan JJ. Latham CJ
authority was quoted for the proposition that the dissolution of a company is a
judicial act. It was said in a general way that
the dissolution of a company
affected the rights of the company. It is true that dissolution terminates the
rights of a company,
but it is a common provision in Companies Acts to provide
for the dissolution of a company, not only by a court, but also by the
of an official: See, for example, the English
Companies Act
s 295, by which it is provided that, after certain notices have been given
by the Registrar of Companies, a company may be
struck off the register, with
the result that the company is dissolved ... Thus it is well recognized that a
registered company may
be dissolved without any judicial proceedings."
and McTiernan JJ, in separate judgments, agreed with the Chief Justice in
this respect.
example of an exercise of legislative power to cancel the registration of an
industrial organisation may be found in
Australian Building Construction
Employees' and Builders Labourers' Federation v The
Commonwealth
Amongst other issues, that case concerned a challenge to the validity of the
Builders Labourers' Federation (Cancellation of Registration) Act 1986
of that Act provided that the registration of the
Australian Building Construction Employees' and Builders Labourers' Federation
Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904
(Cth) was, by force of
that section, cancelled. It was contended that the Act was invalid because it
was an exercise of judicial
power or because it involved an interference with
judicial power. That contention was unanimously rejected by the Court, which
"The Cancellation of Registration Act does not deal with any aspect of the
judicial process. It simply deregisters the Federation,
thereby making redundant
the legal proceedings which it commenced in this Court. It matters not that the
motive or purpose of the
Minister, the Government and the Parliament in enacting
the statute was to circumvent the proceedings and forestall any decision
might be given in those proceedings."
follows that the appointment of the administrator here did not constitute an
exercise of a power exclusively vested in the judicial
government.

least stymied. That result is the inevitable consequence of the removal of

Infringement of the implied freedom of political communication?
Aspects of the evolution of the implied freedom
implication of a freedom of political communication into the
Constitution
has been conceived of as an essential, necessary or indispensable consequence of
"the principle of responsible government –
the system of
government by which the executive is responsible to the legislature" and has
been said to be "not merely an assumption
upon which the actual provisions are
based ... [but] an integral element in the
Constitution
conception of the protected freedom of political communication has evolved over
time. The protected freedom of political communication
has always been
understood to be "an immunity consequent on a limitation of legislative
curtailing the
exercise of legislative and executive power, and not any form of personal right.
The implication has been described
as a "freedom from legislative prohibition
and burdensome interference", its "primary operation [being] to confine, as a
construction, the scope of the legislative powers conferred by
Constitution
boundary of the freedom, it has been said, is "variable" because "in the case of
each law, it is necessary to ascertain the extent
of the restriction, the nature
of the interest served and the proportionality of the restriction to the
interest served".
While "essential to the maintenance of a representative democracy, [freedom of
political communication] is not so transcendent a
value as to override all
interests which the law would otherwise
protected freedom, accordingly, may be confined by the pursuit of other
legitimate interests and the scope of the freedom in
such cases "is limited to

Constitution

Brennan J described such a law as valid if "the
law is enacted to fulfil a
legitimate purpose and the restriction is appropriate and adapted to the
fulfilment of that
this being a
matter of degree and dependent on the particular
circumstances.
According to his Honour, to determine whether a law answers that description "it
is necessary to consider the proportionality between
the restriction which [the]
law imposes on the freedom of communication and the legitimate interest which
the law is intended to
considered that "in determining whether that requirement of reasonable
proportionality is satisfied, it is material to ascertain
whether, and to what
extent, the law goes beyond what is reasonably necessary or conceivably
desirable for the achievement of the
legitimate object sought to be attained
and, in so doing, causes adverse consequences unrelated to the achievement of
that object".
Honour considered that "[i]f the restriction imposes a burden on free
communication that is disproportionate to the attainment
of the competing public
interest, then the existence of the disproportionate burden indicates that the
purpose and effect of the
restriction is in fact to impair freedom of
communication".
Honour distinguished between restrictions on the communication of ideas and
information and restrictions on the modes of communication
of ideas and
information. In the former case, his Honour posited, a "compelling"
justification for the restriction would be required
because a restriction on
ideas and information is a form of political censorship. In the latter case, his
Honour considered that
a restriction may be "more susceptible of
justification".
posited calibration of the test for invalidity reflects the different nature of
the possible restrictions on political communication.
Deane and Toohey JJ
also emphasised the importance of the character of the impugned law to its
validity or invalidity. According
to their Honours, a law "whose character is
that of a law with respect to the prohibition or restriction of communications
government or governmental instrumentalities or institutions ('political
communications') will be much more difficult to justify
as consistent with the
implication than will a law whose character is that of a law with respect to
some other subject and whose
effect on such communications is unrelated to their
nature as political
communications".
Thereafter,
Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation
Brennan CJ, Dawson,
Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ said that infringement of the
protected freedom "will not invalidate
a law enacted to satisfy some other
legitimate end if the law satisfies two conditions. The first condition is that
the object of
the law is compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally
prescribed system of representative and responsible government
... The second is
that the law is reasonably appropriate and adapted to achieving that legitimate
object or end."
conceived, their Honours concluded, the protected freedom did not extend beyond
"what is inherent in the text and structure of
Constitution
Subsequently,
Gleeson CJ similarly drew a distinction between a law having as its "direct
purpose" the restriction of political communication
and a law having some other
legitimate purpose that incidentally imposed a restriction on political
communication. His Honour, adopting
an earlier observation of Gaudron J,
considered that a law in the first category would be valid "only if necessary
for the attainment
of some overriding public purpose". A law in the second
category would not be invalid "simply because it can be shown that some more
limited restriction 'could suffice to achieve a legitimate purpose'". Such a law
would be valid provided it was reasonably appropriate
and adapted to achieve its
other legitimate
also considered that "the reasonably appropriate and adapted test gives
legislatures within the federation a margin of choice
as to how a legitimate end
may be achieved at all events in cases where there is not a total ban on such
communications".
the same effect, in
French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan and Bell JJ said that "[i]n
answering the second
question, there is a distinction, recently
affirmed in
laws which, as they arise in the present case, incidentally restrict political
communication, and laws which prohibit or
regulate communications which are
inherently political or a necessary ingredient of political communication. The
burden upon communication
is more readily seen to satisfy the second
question if the law is of the former rather than the latter
description."
later, French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ characterised the
second condition expressed in
as asking "whether a statutory
provision is proportionate in the means it employs to achieve its object [which]
may involve consideration
of whether there are alternative, reasonably
practicable and less restrictive means of doing
Subsequently
again, French CJ, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ, in applying
explained the first condition of validity of a law restricting political
communications (the object of the law is compatible with
the maintenance of the
constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government)
as focusing on the compatibility
of both the object (or purpose) of the law and
the means adopted to achieve that object (or purpose). Both object (or purpose)
means were described as subject to the requirement of compatibility with the
constitutionally prescribed system of representative
and responsible government.
If the law's object (or purpose) and the means the law used to achieve that
object (or purpose) satisfied
the compatibility test, the question remained
whether the law was reasonably appropriate and adapted to advance that
legitimate object
(or purpose). This last step in the process, for their
Honours, focused on the law being "proportionate" in the sense of being
as suitable, necessary and adequate in its balance", where:
suitability involved the existence of a rational connection between the
its object (or purpose); necessity involved a lack of any "obvious and
compelling alternative, reasonably practicable means
of achieving the same
purpose which has a less restrictive effect on the freedom"; and adequacy in
balance involved "a value judgment,

Ultimately,
"[w]hichever expression is used [reasonably appropriate and adapted or

of the idea it is intended to

degree of scrutiny to the purpose of the law and
the means the law uses to
achieve its purpose. There is a manifest difference between (on the one hand) a
law the direct and immediate

political communications which uses direct and immediate means to achieve the
prohibition or restriction and (on the other hand) a law the direct and
immediate purpose of which is to achieve some legitimate

communication by some remote and

resolution of these streams of thought, their common sources, confluences and
divergences, is not required in the present
case. The weight of the plaintiffs'
arguments rested principally on the alleged illegitimate purpose of
of Ch 11 to restrict the C&G Division's political communications and
secondarily on the alleged lack of justification for that
restriction. If
of Ch 11 restricts the C&G Division's freedom of political
communication, the twofold inquiry from
involves determining,
of Ch 11 has a legitimate constitutional purpose (that
is, an object or end compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally
prescribed system of representative and responsible government) and, second,
of Ch 11 is reasonably appropriate and adapted to

Division to engage in political communications
to achieve the CFMEU's political
objects before and after the enactment of

of Ch 11 and the placing of the
C&G Division under administration as provided for in the provisions of that
Part was simple.
Relevantly, and as recorded in the special case, the C&G
Division: contributes by far the most revenue of any Division to the
constitutes over 76% of the financial members of the CFMEU; and has the greatest
voting power within the CFMEU. The C&G
Division, acting through officers

"[t]ake such steps
as it shall consider necessary to carry out all or any of the
objects" of the CFMEU including by the full suite of lawful political
communications (including fund-raising, political donations, supporting and
opposing parties, supporting and opposing candidates,
advertising, lobbying,
demonstrating, and otherwise engaging in political discourse as the elected and
appointed officers of the
C&G Division saw fit). Through the decisions of
its elected and appointed officers, the C&G Division could engage in these
political communications by the application of its property and funds in
accordance with the C&G Division Rules. By this means,
the C&G Division,
by the power of association, could "build and assert political

form and substance, represented or could be taken to represent the collective
will of the members of the C&G Division. It therefore could be taken that

or at and under the
direction of, those officers was collective action by and on behalf of the
C&G Division and its members in
their collective capacity. The importance of
this representative status of officers appointed and elected in accordance with
C&G Division Rules to the legitimacy of their decisions as a
manifestation of the collective will of the C&G Division, and
capacity of members to influence such elected and appointed officials in their
decision-making, is not to be under-estimated.
recorded in the special case: the CFMEU is one of the 10 largest registered
organisations under the

officers found to have breached the Industrial Laws since 2019 included some
officeholders
of the C&G Divisional Executive and of every C&G
Divisional Branch immediately before" the commencement of the Scheme. The
special case also records that the CFMEU has a lengthy and extensive history of
engaging in political activities and political communications
lobbying political parties, elected representatives, and candidates; supporting
the re-election of political parties and
candidates; holding rallies for the
purpose of pressuring political parties in relation to particular public policy
positions; running
campaigns for legislative reform in respect of particular
issues (eg, introducing industrial manslaughter as a criminal offence in
State and Territory, banning the use, importation and manufacture of engineered
stone in Australia, opposing the establishment
of the Australian Building and
Construction Commission and the Building Code, managing the housing crisis, and
securing Australian
jobs); publishing political communications; and working or
affiliating with other unions and employee associations to political ends.
Pt 2A of Ch 11 of the
placing the C&G Division under
administration, and the consequential provisions of
representative decision-making capacity and representative collective action
capacity has been removed from the elected and
appointed officers of the C&G
Division and placed into the hands of the administrator, a person appointed by
mandate external
to the C&G Division Rules and who, accordingly, does not
have the status of a representative of the collective will of the members
C&G Division.
relevant point is not that one individual (the administrator) now stands in the
shoes of several individuals (the officers of
the C&G Division) who
previously managed the affairs and controlled the property of the CFMEU. Neither
the CFMEU nor the C&G
Division is analogous to a corporation by whom
executive officers are employed. Nor is the point that the elected and appointed
of the C&G Division change over time, with the appointment of an
administrator constituting but another change in control of
Division. The relevant point is that, but for Pt 2A of Ch 11 and the
placing of the C&G Division under administration,
all officers would
continue to be elected or appointed in accordance with the C&G Division
Rules. By being so elected and appointed
under the C&G Division Rules, those
officers were (and but for the administration would have continued to be) a
representative
manifestation of the collective will of the members of the
C&G Division. The placing of the C&G Division under administration
the appointment to it of an administrator did not merely change the governance
or management of the C&G Division from several
individuals to one
individual. It involved the externally mandated appointment of a person to all
positions of governance and management
of the C&G Division other than in
accordance with the C&G Division Rules. Such a person, by definition, is not
and can never
be a representative manifestation of the collective will of the
members of the C&G Division. What has been lost by the members

inherent and inevitable impact on the C&G Division's capacity to engage in
political communication of placing the C&G
Division under administration is
in no way undone or ameliorated by the capacity of individual members of the
C&G Division to
engage in political communications, either individually or
in some form of new affiliation with each other. So much is manifest from
first stated object of the CFMEU, to "uphold the right of combination of
labour". The very assertion of such a "right" is a political
statement. It is a
political statement expressing the existence of a fundamental difference between
a "right" of employees to combine
as a collective in their dealings with
employers and a "right" of individual employees to deal with their employers.
That there is
such a fundamental difference cannot be
recognition of the existence of this
difference and its social, economic and legal importance is the reason for

Division as they decided fit to best achieve the objects of the
CFMEU as a manifestation of the collective will of the members of
Division. While the CFMEU's objects remain, placing the C&G Division under
administration removes that capacity.
By force of the administration under
Pt 2A of Ch 11, it is now the decision of the administrator, not those
officers elected and
appointed in accordance with the C&G Division Rules, to
decide if, when and how to engage in political communications using the
resources of the C&G Division as the administrator decides fit to best
achieve the objects of the CFMEU.
is not to say, however, that the administrator's performance of functions and
exercise of powers is unconfined. The constraint
on the administrator's
performance of functions and exercise of powers is that, by s 323K(5), the
administrator must be satisfied
the administrator is acting in the best
interests of the members of the C&G Division and have regard to the objects
of the CFMEU
as defined in the CFMEU Rules at the commencement of s 323A so
far as they are lawful.
is the true nature of this constraint? For one thing, the administrator's
exercise of control over the property and affairs
of the C&G Division in
s 323K(1) is subject to the constraint as expressed in s 323K(5).
the proper construction of the statutory provisions, the constraint in
s 323K(5) applies to the performance of every function
and the exercise of
every power by the administrator. The administrator, for example, cannot comply
with s 323K(5) by weighing acts
in the course of the administration one
against the other, some in the best interests of members of the C&G Division
not, and decide that the overall balance is in the best interests of
members. With respect to each performance of a function and
each exercise of a
power the administrator must be satisfied the performance or exercise is in the
best interests of members of the
C&G Division and the administrator must
reach that state of satisfaction having regard to the objects of the CFMEU.
it is for the administrator to reach the requisite state of satisfaction about
each and every one of the administrator's decisions
(including decisions not to
act), any such state of satisfaction also must be such as could be formed by a
reasonable person correctly
understanding the law under which the administrator
operates. Such a state of satisfaction, therefore, cannot be arbitrary or be
based on the consideration of matters which, upon the proper construction of
Pt 2A of Ch 11, the Scheme, and the lawful objects of
defined in the CFMEU Rules before the commencement of s 323A, are
irrelevant. The state of satisfaction must be one reached
"according to the
rules of reason and justice, not according to private opinion ... according to
law, and not humour".
Accordingly, if the state of satisfaction reached by the administrator for a
decision in the course of the administration is "reached
by taking into account
irrelevant considerations or by otherwise misconstruing the terms of the
relevant legislation, then it must
be held that the [state of satisfaction] has
not been formed. In that event the basis for the exercise of power is absent,
if it were shown that the [state of satisfaction] was arbitrary,
capricious, irrational, or not bona
noted, in reaching the required state of satisfaction that the administrator is
acting in the best interests of the members of
the C&G Division, the
administrator must have regard to the objects of the CFMEU as defined in the
CFMEU Rules (so far as they
are lawful) at the commencement of s 323A. The
temporal qualification here is important. It is the objects as at that time (23
2024) which are relevant. No subsequent amendment of the CFMEU Rules
affects those objects. It is those objects to which the administrator
regard in deciding what actions are in the best interests of the C&G
Division's members. Those objects, accordingly,
are to be a centrally relevant
consideration in and focal point of the administrator's decision-making
also noted, the objects of the CFMEU are overtly political and achievable by
political communications. How, in performing a function
or exercising a power,
is the administrator to be satisfied that the administrator is acting in the
best interests of members of
the C&G Division having regard to the objects
of the CFMEU when the administrator has not been elected or appointed by members
to any office of the C&G Division in accordance with the C&G Division
Rules? This question needs to be answered to enable
the nature and extent of the
restriction that the enactment of Pt 2A imposes on the C&G Division's
freedom of political communication
to be known. The answer to this question is
in the meaning and operation of the legislative provisions construed in light of
fact that the administrator's exercise of control over the property and
affairs of the C&G Division in s 323K(1), subject to
the constraint in
s 323K(5), is to be read in accordance with
Interpretation Act 1901
(Cth) (that "[e]very Act shall be read and construed
subject to the
Constitution
, and so as not to exceed the legislative power of
the Commonwealth, to the intent that where any enactment thereof would, but for
this section, have been construed as being in excess of that power, it shall
nevertheless be a valid enactment to the extent to which
it is not in excess of
that power").
of Ch 11 contains no provision which expressly or implicitly
prevents or restricts the administrator from applying resources of the
Division to the making of political communications. To the contrary, it contains
s 323K(5), which imposes on the administrator
the duty of the required
state of satisfaction (best interests of the members) and the duty of
consideration (the objects of the
CFMEU) in respect of the performance of every
function and the exercise of every power in the administration.
as pointed out above, the objects of the CFMEU which apply under s 323K(5)
are those which existed before the administration.
This means those objects are
effectively entrenched. Those objects remain unaffected by any alteration of the
C&G Division Rules
under s 323H.
any tension between s 323F and s 323K(5) must also be resolved in
favour of s 323K(5). By this, although by s 323F the Scheme
action taken under it "have effect" despite anything in the
Fair Work Act
, the CFMEU Rules and the C&G Division Rules, that does not mean
that the administrator, in taking action under the Scheme, can
avoid complying
with s 323K(5) in respect of the performance of every function and the
exercise of every power. Each and every action
taken under the Scheme involves
the performance of a function and the exercise of a power in respect of which
the administrator must
comply with s 323K(5). Provided the performance of
the function and the exercise of the power do so comply then the resulting
will have effect as provided for in s 323F.
as the Scheme cannot rise higher than its source in s 323B, no provision of
the Scheme can affect the operation of s 323K(5).
although the administrator, as a person appointed by external mandate and not
elected or appointed in accordance with the
C&G Division Rules, is not and
cannot be a representation of the collective will of the members of the C&G
Division, s 323B(3)
identifies matters for which a scheme must provide.
These matters include: in s 323B(3)(d), the timing of elections of
in s 323B(3)(i), the delegation by the administrator of the
administrator's functions and powers; in s 323B(3)(j), the engagement
employment of persons by the administrator to assist in performing the
administrator's functions; and in s 323B(3)(l), matters
ancillary or
incidental to the other matters in s 323B(3). Together with the functions
of the administrator under s 323K(1) and the
operation of s 323F,
these provisions ensure that the administrator has practical and legal capacity
for the administrator to ascertain
the will of the majority of members of the
C&G Division in respect of such matters as the administrator considers
appropriate,
including the making of political communications.
nothing in Pt 2A of Ch 11 prevents members of the C&G Division
individually or collectively, as they see fit, from informing
the administrator
of steps they wish the administrator to take to ascertain the will of the
majority of members of the C&G Division
in respect of such matters as they
consider appropriate, including the making of political communications.
s 323K(5), at the least, would operate to require the administrator, on the
receipt of any such request, to consider the
request in good faith and
reasonably and to be satisfied that the administrator's response to the request
is in the best interests
of the members having had regard to the objects of the
CFMEU. The administrator could not, in compliance with s 323K(5), refuse to
consider any such request. Nor could the statutory provisions be construed as
enabling the administrator to disregard any such request,
given the operation of
Acts Interpretation Act
Section 15A
Acts Interpretation Act
cannot, however, change the ultimate fact
that it is for the administrator to decide in good faith and on a reasonable and
lawful basis in accordance with the criteria in s 323K(5) whether
the C&G Division should make a political communication and,
timing and nature of that communication. Accordingly, while
in terms prevent the C&G Division from engaging in political communications,
in its legal and practical operation it
significantly restricts the C&G
Division's capacity to do so by vesting in the administrator both the control of
all of the C&G
Division's affairs and property and a wide (albeit not
unfettered) decision-making capacity about the best interests of the members
the C&G Division having regard to the objects of the CFMEU.

the Second Reading Speech for the
Fair Work (Registered Organisations)
Amendment (Administration) Bill 2024
(Cth), the Minister for Employment and
Workplace Relations tabled the Bill and explained that "[s]ince July 2024,
serious allegations
have come to light about the conduct of some members and
associates of the Construction and General Division of the Construction,
Forestry and Maritime Employees Union". The Minister said that the "Australian
government takes these allegations seriously. There
is no place for criminality
or corruption in the construction industry, and bullying, thuggery and
intimidation are unacceptable
in any workplace". After noting that the General
Manager of the FWC had applied to the Federal Court of Australia for a
declaration
that the majority of branches of the C&G Division were no longer
able to function effectively, including in the interests of
members, and that
there were no effective means under the relevant rules to address the
application in which the Minister had intervened to support, the Minister said
that the government had "made clear that, if the
matter was not resolved before
parliament returned, we would introduce legislation to facilitate
administration, if it was determined
to be in the public interest". The Minister
expressed the "government's firm view that enabling administration, not
deregistration,
is the strongest action to take in these circumstances" as
deregistration of the C&G Division would not stop the CFMEU from
participating
in a range of industrial activities whereas placing the C&G
Division into administration "would maintain the regulation and additional
oversight that applies to registered organisations and ensure the division acts
in the best interests of its members". According
to the Minister, the Bill
included "strong powers" for the administrator and would allow the administrator
to take action necessary
to restore the effective management and operation of
the C&G Division, giving the administrator control of the C&G Division's
property and
related Explanatory Memorandum also recorded the background to the Bill as the
making of serious allegations of corruption, criminal
conduct and other serious
misconduct including bullying and harassment and general disregard for workplace
laws by some officials
and associates of the C&G Division, as well as the
General Manager of the FWC's view that the majority of branches of the C&G
Division were no longer able to function effectively. The Explanatory Memorandum
further stated that the General Manager's application
to the Federal Court
included information that, "since 2003, the CFMEU has been the subject of
findings of contraventions of federal
workplace laws on more than 1,500
occasions (plus 1,100 contraventions by its officeholders, employees, delegates
and members) in
approximately 213 proceedings, resulting in total penalties
ordered against the CFMEU of at least $24 million plus at least $4 million
ordered against its office holders, employees, delegates and members". According
to the Explanatory Memorandum, since July 2024,
the General Manager of the FWC
had also become aware of other alleged criminal and serious misconduct by
officers of the C&G
Division, including dealings with and involvement in the
C&G Division's affairs of persons with criminal associations. The
Explanatory
Memorandum stated that the "legislative amendments in the Bill seek
to protect the interests of members of the [C&G Division],
and if a scheme
of administration is determined, would seek to help return the [C&G
Division] to a position where it is democratically
controlled by those who
promote and act in accordance with Australian laws, including workplace laws"
and that the "proposed legislation
is necessary to end ongoing dysfunction
within the [C&G Division] and to ensure it is able to operate effectively in
the interests
Explanatory Memorandum taking into account amendments made to the Bill in the
Senate after its introduction recorded the
same information.
disclosed in this extrinsic material, part of the context of the enactment of Pt
2A of Ch 11 is that, before its enactment, the
of Ch 2 and
of Ch 11. According to the Minister's Second
Reading Speech, while an application to the Federal Court for a declaration
had been filed by the General Manager of the FWC, the
government's view was that administration was the strongest action as it would
maintain the regulation and oversight of the C&G Division as part of a
registered organisation.
part of the context of the enactment of
of Ch 11 disclosed in
the extrinsic material is that the objective circumstances which called forth
the legislation included both:
the record of the CFMEU and its officers,
including officers of the C&G Division, on an unprecedented scale of
repeated contraventions
of industrial legislation; and the seriousness and
extent of allegations against members of the C&G Division, including
criminality,
corruption, bullying, thuggery and intimidation, which evidenced
perceived dysfunction and necessitated action to return to the C&G
the capacity to function effectively, including in the interests of members and
in accordance with Australian laws, including
workplace laws.
plaintiffs relied on other documents as part of the context relevant to the
enactment of
of Ch 11 and related provisions including parts of
the debates in Parliament and correspondence, including from the administrator
before his appointment to the effect that, if appointed, he "intend[ed] to
conduct a lawful Administration" and to vary the C&G
Division Rules to
"prohibit the making of party-political donations or the funding of
party-political campaigns". The compatibility
of those two expressed objectives
is not for determination in this matter. It is sufficient to refer to some
aspects of the Parliamentary
debates. During extensive debate over several days
in the Senate, the Minister said that the government had agreed "that the scheme
of administration that would be applied under this legislation would ban
donations to any political party for the period of the administration",
had been confirmed in a letter. Another Senator also said that the government
had committed to "ensuring political donations
and political expenditure from
the CFMEU are banned during the period of the administration". In the House of
Representatives there
was reference to the proposed administrator under the
legislation having confirmed that during the period of administration the
Division would not "engage in party politics ... donations, positions at
political party conferences, and promotions of particular
candidates".
may be accepted that legislative purposes are not to be divined from private
communications. Parliamentary debates, however, occur
in the public domain.
Further, once it is accepted that the objective circumstances which called forth
the legislation are relevant
to the ascertainment of legislative purpose, it
must also be accepted that ensuring that, for the period of the administration,
C&G Division would not engage in political activities, including
political communications, formed part of those objective circumstances.
characterise this objective as a mere subjective reason that some individual
legislators or the legislature as a collective wanted
to enact Pt 2A may be
convenient but is not convincing. There is no justification to accept one
publicly stated legislative purpose
– to restore functionality
to the C&G Division – and yet to ignore another publicly
stated legislative purpose –
to ensure that the C&G Division
would be prevented from political activity including political communications
during the period
of administration. No doubt individual legislators may have
had different reasons or motives for wanting to achieve this objective.
those reasons and motives which are to be disregarded, not the objective itself.
may also be accepted that there is no express statement of this objective of
Parliament in enacting Pt 2A of Ch 11 to be found
provisions of the Part. This absence, however, applies across the board. There
is also no statement of Parliamentary objective
in Pt 2A to:
(a) provide an effective and quick response to allegations of serious and
extensive criminal and unlawful conduct and
mismanagement by officers of the
C&G Division; or (b) swiftly restore the effective management and
operation of the C&G Division.
No more can be drawn from legislative silence
is also not to the point that the legislation was not amended to ensure that the
end, object or purpose of preventing the C&G
Division from engaging in
political communications during the administration could be achieved. Given the
nature of the CFMEU and
the C&G Division, this end, object or purpose is
(and always was) inherent in the legislative means of placing the C&G
under administration by which control of its property and affairs would
be removed from those responsible for such control under
the CFMEU Rules and
C&G Division Rules and vested in an administrator. The legislation was not
made in a vacuum decontextualised
from the essential characteristics of the
CFMEU of which the C&G Division forms part. The CFMEU, as an association of
the objects of which include upholding the "right of combination of
labour", to "do all things conducive to the welfare and organisation
working class", to secure legislation for the well-being of members, to "take
part in any or all questions ... affecting or
involving the wages and conditions
of labour", and to raise political levies, make political donations and
affiliate with political
parties, is a political body, collectivised to achieve
collective political ends. To remove control of the affairs and property of
C&G Division from those who exercise and deal with it in accordance with the
CFMEU Rules and C&G Division Rules and give
such control to an administrator
inherently and inevitably affects the capacity of the C&G Division to engage
in acts to achieve
the CFMEU's political objects by means of political
communications.
should also be no doubt that Pt 2A of Ch 11, in its legal and
practical operation, can achieve the end of preventing the C&G
Division from
engaging in political communications during the administration. While the
administrator must act reasonably and comply
with the law, as described above,
the ultimate decision is for the administrator alone.
placing the C&G Division under administration has this inherent and
inevitable impact reinforces the conclusion that Pt
2A of Ch11 has
several ends, objects or purposes. It should be unsurprising that legislation
which in fact enables multiple material
objectives to be achieved is to be
characterised as having as its purposes the achievement of each of those
objectives. It must be
inferred from the context and text of Pt 2A of
Ch 11 that it was intended to serve each of these objectives. The object of
the C&G Division from engaging in political communications while
it is under administration cannot be characterised as a mere
consequence or effect of Pt 2A of Ch 11. Nor can it be characterised
as an immaterial, tangential, subsidiary, ancillary,
subservient or minor object
of the Part. It must be characterised as an end, object or purpose of Pt 2A
of Ch 11 which is itself
material and substantial.
Accordingly,
the ends, objects or purposes of Pt 2A of Ch 11 should be recognised
to be: (a) providing an effective and quick response
to allegations of
serious and extensive criminal and unlawful conduct and mismanagement by
officers of the C&G Division; (b)
swiftly restoring the effective
management and operation of the C&G Division; and (c) preventing the
C&G Division from engaging
in political communications while it is under
administration.
Multiple/mixed ends, objects or purposes
several reasons, the end, object or purpose of preventing the C&G Division
from engaging in political communications is not
compatible with the maintenance
of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible
government.
the C&G Division, and the CFMEU of which it forms part, is an association of
employees of a kind which the Australian
legal system presumes to exist and
contemplates as existing to perform functions within our system of industrial
relations. That
is, the existence, objects and operations of the C&G
Division, and the CFMEU of which it forms part, themselves form a legitimate
part of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible
government which the implied freedom of political
communication protects.
and consistently with this status of the C&G Division, and the CFMEU of
which it forms part, nothing in their constitutive
documents indicates any
incompatibility between their existence, objects and operations and our
constitutionally prescribed system
of representative and responsible government.
the other manifestly legitimate ends, objects or purposes of Pt 2A
of Ch 11 (providing an effective and quick response to
allegations of
serious and extensive criminal and unlawful conduct and mismanagement by
officers of the C&G Division and swiftly
restoring the effective management
and operation of the C&G Division) do not suggest any irresolvable
incompatibility between
the existence, objects and operations of the C&G
Division, and the CFMEU of which it forms part, and our constitutionally
system of representative and responsible government. To the contrary,
the statutory scheme enacted for the purpose of regulating
employee associations
indicates that such compatibility is the norm, from which operations of the
C&G Division, and the CFMEU
of which it forms part, have
deviated – as evidenced by the number of contraventions of
industrial legislation by the CFMEU
and its officers and the extent and
seriousness of the allegations of criminal or improper conduct by the CFMEU and
can be no doubt that if preventing the C&G Division from engaging in
political communications was the sole substantial
or material end, object or
purpose of Pt 2A of Ch 11, the Part would be invalid by operation
of the first element of the
test. A law which has as its sole
purpose preventing political communications by an association the existence,
objects and operations
of which are themselves lawful cannot be compatible with
the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative
responsible government. This proposition, however, does not answer the question
of validity if preventing the C&G Division
from engaging in political
communications is not the sole substantial or material end, object or purpose of
Pt 2A but, rather, is
one only of three substantial or material ends,
objects or purposes of the provisions, the other two being legitimate
approach should be taken to the validity or invalidity of a law by reason of
infringement of the implied freedom of political
communication if the ends,
objects or purposes of the law are several in number, one or more of which
satisfies and one or more of
which fails the first aspect of the
test? No previous authority has determined this issue. Nor is it to be assumed
that when previous decisions have referred to the
vitiating effect of
(meaning sole) purpose of a law that is incompatible with the maintenance of the
constitutionally prescribed system of representative
and responsible government,
those cases also decided the question of the validity a law having more than one
purpose where one purpose
is compatible with the maintenance of the
constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government
and another
purpose is not so compatible.
is convenient here to contrast the nature of the freedom of political
communication, as a protection implied into the
Constitution
by reason of
necessity, and express provisions of the
Constitution
Section 116
provides that the "Commonwealth shall not make any law for
establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or
prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be
required as a qualification for any office or public
trust under the
Commonwealth". To the extent that the relational "for" here indicates that
prohibits the Commonwealth making
proscribed by the
a law which
purpose the establishing of any religion (etc) will be
invalidated by
whether it has other, constitutionally legitimate
purposes or not. That is, it is the existence of the purpose impugned by
which invalidates the law because it is the mere presence of that
impugned purpose which contravenes
freedom of political communication also differs from the express provision of
Constitution
, that "trade, commerce, and intercourse
among the States, whether by means of internal carriage or ocean navigation,
shall be absolutely
free". The now established construction of
it protects interstate trade and commerce against "discriminatory burdens of a
protectionist kind".
In this context, the fact or effect of a discriminatory burden of a
protectionist kind has been the essential touchstone of invalidity.
Accordingly,
"if a law, which may be otherwise justified by reference to an object which is
not protectionist, discriminates against
interstate trade or commerce in pursuit
of that object in a way or to an extent which warrants characterization of the
law as protectionist,
a court will be justified in concluding that it
nonetheless offends
objects or purposes of the law are relevant to its
characterisation,
the existence of other, non-protectionist purposes will not save a law from
invalidity if the law has a protectionist purpose
and discriminates against
interstate trade or commerce so that it can be characterised as a protectionist
implied freedom of political communication may also be contrasted with the
operation of Ch III of the
Constitution
, which vests the judicial
power of the Commonwealth (including punishment) in courts. The test for
infringement of Ch III by a law
authorising the non-judicial detention of a
person (ordinarily constituting punishment), which is whether the law is
reasonably capable
of being seen to be necessary for a legitimate and
non-punitive purpose,
is similarly "ultimately directed to a single question of characterisation:
whether the power to impose the detriment conferred by
the law is properly
characterised as punitive and therefore as exclusively
contrast to these examples, where the constitutional prohibition is absolute and
the test for validity applies accordingly, the
implied constitutional protection
of freedom of political communication is a brake on otherwise existing
legislative and executive
power. By reason of this nature of the implied
freedom, its operation must be calibrated to no more than that which is
in each case for the effective operation of that system of
representative and responsible government provided for by the
Constitution
. It follows from this that in circumstances where a law has
multiple legislative purposes one of which is compatible with the maintenance
the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible
government it can no more be assumed that, by operation
of the implied freedom,
the mere existence of another incompatible purpose of the law (in this case,
preventing the C&G Division
from engaging in political communications during
the administration) has the consequence of invalidity, than it can be assumed
any effect of a law in restricting political communications has that
consequence. As the protection of free political communication
is not absolute,
it being accepted that such freedom is not a transcendent value to which all
other legitimate objects must yield,
the existence of an illegitimate
legislative purpose does not have the consequence of invalidity if there are
also legitimate legislative
purposes ascertainable and the law otherwise
satisfies the twofold test in
. To conclude otherwise is not to
perform a judicial duty of upholding the
Constitution
, but to enable the
implied freedom of political communication to go further than necessary to
protect the system of representative
and responsible government embodied in the
Constitution
explain this further, as has been said, the relevant context here is not the
subjective purpose of legislators either individually
or collectively.
Accordingly, provided it can be said that each end, object or purpose of the
legislation (legitimate and illegitimate)
is material or substantial (in this
context, these two concepts have the same meaning, and are intended to
distinguish a legislative
end, object or purpose of a law from a mere incidental
effect of a law), there is no point in a search for a so-called dominant,
substantial, motivating or causal (in the sense of "but for") purpose. No
analogy can be drawn between a legislature enacting legislation
it is otherwise
empowered to enact (which has the effect of restricting political
communications, and which therefore must be subjected
to the twofold test in
) and an administrative decision-maker exercising a power for a
purpose outside of the purposes for which the power was conferred.
In the former
case, the only relevant "purpose" is the objective legislative purpose (or
purposes) which the law seeks to achieve.
In the latter case, the relevant
"purpose" is the motivating or actuating purpose of the decision-maker in making
the decision. In
the former case, the focus on purpose is required by the first
limb of the test in
because the ultimate inquiry is whether the
means adopted by Parliament to achieve a legitimate purpose of the law are
appropriate and adapted to the achievement of that purpose and,
accordingly, the relationship between the legitimate purpose and
selected to achieve that purpose is part of the calibration of the test for the
curtailment of legislative and executive
power imposed by the implied
constitutional freedom. In the latter case, the focus on purpose is required
because there will be no
power to exercise if the purpose of the exercise is not
itself authorised by the legislation vesting the power in the decision-maker.
Accordingly, in the former case and unlike in the latter
the existence of
several purposes, some legitimate and some not under the first limb of the test
, cannot and does not call for any consideration of the dominant,
substantial, motivating or causal purpose of the legislature.
follows that, in applying the first limb of the test in
part of the inquiry to attempt to divine whether, but for the illegitimate
purpose, the legislature would or would not
have enacted the legislation. As a
brake on legislative power, the legislation to which the twofold test in
is to be applied is taken to be one that the legislature was
otherwise empowered to and did enact. It is only if the legislation
political communication that the test in
is to be applied. The
legislation will fail the first limb of the
test if its sole
substantial or material end, object or purpose is not one which is compatible
with the maintenance of the constitutionally
prescribed system of representative
and responsible government. It will not fail the first limb of the
test if one or more of its substantial or material ends, objects or purposes is
compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally
prescribed system of
representative and responsible government. In such a case, it will be necessary
to apply the second limb of
test. In the application of that
limb, the existence of the illegitimate purpose may be relevant. For example, if
the consequence
or effect of the law's illegitimate purpose is that the means
the law uses to achieve its purposes go beyond what is reasonably necessary
achieve the legitimate purpose or purposes and a disproportionate burden on the
freedom of political communication results from
the means so doing, it may be
that the law is not reasonably appropriate and adapted to the achievement of its
legitimate purposes;
but the existence of
purpose of a law which is
incompatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of
representative and responsible
government does not necessarily result in the
invalidity of that law. This approach ensures that the implied freedom, based as
is on a value that does not transcend all other potentially competing values,
does not rise higher than its source.

v The Commonwealth

of Ch 11 of the
operates to restrict, and can operate to prevent, the political communications
of the C&G Division. In this sense, it is a restriction
on the communication
of political ideas by the C&G Division rather than a restriction on the mode
by which the C&G Division
might communicate political ideas. As explained,
however, the restriction on freedom of political communication is not by way of
of Ch 11 directly prohibiting the administrator from
enabling the C&G Division to engage in political communications during the
administration. The restriction is an inevitable and inherent operational effect
or consequence of the means adopted by Parliament
to attain the legitimate
objects of (a) providing an effective and quick response to allegations of
serious and extensive criminal
and unlawful conduct and mismanagement by
officers of the C&G Division; and (b) swiftly restoring the effective
management and
operation of the C&G Division, that is, by the placing of the
C&G Division under administration and the vesting in the administrator
control of the property and affairs of the C&G Division. Accordingly,
although not a complete fit with the facts of this case,
the (somewhat) greater
resonance is from the observation of Deane and Toohey JJ in
Capital Television
distinguishing between a law having the character of
being with respect to the prohibition or restriction of political communications
and a law with respect to some other subject and whose effect on such
communications is unrelated to their nature as political
communications.
fit between this observation and the present case is by no means perfect,
however, because of the nature of the C&G Division
as a Division of the
CFMEU, the objects of which are essentially political and whose communications,
therefore, are also essentially
distinction, nevertheless, is helpful as it exposes that along the spectrum
which Gleeson CJ identified in
Coleman v Power
, between (at one end)
a law having as its direct purpose the restriction of political communication
and (at the other end) a law
having some other, legitimate object that
incidentally imposes a restriction on political
communication,
of Ch 11 sits somewhere in the middle. The effect of
of Ch 11 in restricting political communications is an inevitable
consequence of the enactment of
, but that consequence or effect is
not merely an incident of the operation of the legislation. Given the nature of
the CFMEU of which
the C&G Division forms part, that consequence or effect
is inherent in the transfer of control of the property and affairs of
C&G Division to an externally mandated person.
should be no conceptual difficulty in accepting that in applying the second limb
test, the position of the law along the spectrum which
Gleeson CJ identified is relevant to the calibration of the test, whether
that calibration be described as attaching to the intensity of the review or the
margin of choice which legislatures have in deciding
the means to achieve the
ends, objects or purposes of the legislation. It should also be apparent that,
in this case,
of Ch 11 can achieve the legitimate
objectives of the legislation. In that sense,
of Ch 11 is
appropriate and adapted to those ends, because vesting control of the C&G
Division's property and affairs in an externally
mandated person enables that
person to investigate the activities of the C&G Division and its officers,
ascertain the actions
which are required to swiftly restore the effective
management and operation of the C&G Division, and take those actions. It
follows that the issue is not whether
of Ch 11 is appropriate
and adapted to achieve its legitimate ends. It is. The question is whether it is
appropriate and adapted to do so, having regard to the nature
of the legitimate ends to be served and the nature and extent of the
imposed on the freedom of political communication.
evaluating this question whether
of Ch 11 is reasonably
appropriate and adapted to achieve its legitimate ends, in applying the second
limb of the
test it is not for the courts to second-guess the
circumstances which the Parliament identified as calling forth the legislation.
The Parliament was confronted by circumstances of the CFMEU's repeated
contraventions of industrial legislation on an unprecedented
scale, along with
serious allegations of the infiltration of the C&G Division by persons with
criminal associations, and alleged
serious criminality and corruption by some
officers of the CFMEU. The Minister said the "Australian government takes these
allegations
seriously". The Parliament was entitled to take the allegations
seriously. That the circumstances included allegations (rather than
proof of the
criminality and corruption the subject of the allegations) may be accepted. But
that does not deny to the Parliament
the capacity to respond effectively to the
circumstances with which it was confronted. Courts are bound to convict and
sentence or
punish on proof; Parliament is not so bound in regulating the
conduct of a registered organisation under the
of Ch 11 of the
is an effective means of Parliament achieving its
legitimate objects of (a) providing an effective and quick response to
allegations
of serious and extensive criminal and unlawful conduct and
mismanagement by officers of the C&G Division; and (b) swiftly
the effective management and operation of the C&G Division. That
the Parliament could have awaited the outcome of the application
to the Federal
Court by the General Manager of the FWC under
be accepted. That Parliament did not do so does not indicate that
Ch 11 is other than reasonably appropriate and adapted to its legitimate
objects. Parliament also did not consider an application
for the cancellation of
the registration of the CFMEU under
to be preferable
to the enactment of
of Ch 11. While these options were both
available, the second limb of the test in
does not ask this Court
to decide which option might have caused the least restriction on freedom of
political communication. The
question is whether the option Parliament did take,
the enactment of
of Ch 11, is reasonably appropriate and adapted
to the legitimate objects of the Part. In determining that question, it may be
that the existence of an obvious and compelling alternative means to
achieve the same objects, having a clearly less restrictive
effect on freedom of
political communication, may be relevant or
determinative.
this case, there is no obvious and compelling alternative to the enactment of
of Ch 11 to achieve the same objects, which would have had a
clearly less restrictive effect on freedom of political communication.
Parliament was entitled to conclude that the objectives of (a) providing an
effective and quick response to allegations of serious
and extensive criminal
and unlawful conduct and mismanagement by officers of the C&G Division and
(b) swiftly restoring the effective
management and operation of the C&G
Division, in the face of the circumstances confronting Parliament, required the
the C&G Division's property and affairs to be removed from the
officers under whose governance the circumstances had arisen and
another person to enable the investigation and, to the extent required, to
rectify and remedy the circumstances which had
resulted in the CFMEU having been
found to have committed contraventions of industrial legislation on an
unprecedented scale and
to have fostered criminal associations and allegedly
engaged in serious criminal conduct. Once that is accepted, it follows that
restriction of freedom of political communication this involved should be seen
to be an inevitable consequence or effect of the
action to achieve Parliament's
legitimate objectives.
evaluating this question whether
of Ch 11 is reasonably
appropriate and adapted to achieve its legitimate ends it is also relevant to
consider the nature of those
ends. The circumstances with which the Parliament
was confronted in respect of the CFMEU – the unprecedented scale
of repeated
contraventions of industrial legislation and the serious allegations
of criminal associations within the C&G Division and of
serious criminal
conduct – make the objectives of (a) providing an effective
and quick response to allegations of serious and
extensive criminal and unlawful
conduct and mismanagement by officers of the C&G Division and
(b) swiftly restoring the effective
management and operation of the C&G
Division, in the face of the circumstances confronting Parliament, both rational
and compelling.
noted, the special case discloses that the CFMEU is a large and politically
active registered organisation and, of the CFMEU Divisions,
the C&G Division
is by far the largest contributor in terms of membership, membership fees and
other revenues, and voting power.
Actual and alleged serious criminal, unlawful
and improper conduct within the C&G Division goes to the heart of the
CFMEU's capacity
to function as a registered organisation and its capacity to
satisfy the objectives of the
, including to: "enhance relations within
workplaces between federal system employers and federal system employees and to
adverse effects of industrial disputation"
that employer and employee organisations registered under this Act are
representative of and accountable to their members,
and are able to operate
effectively" (s 5(3)(a)); "encourage the efficient management of
organisations and high standards of accountability
of organisations to their
members" (s 5(3)(c)); and facilitate "the operation of the workplace
relations system" (s 5(5)). Further,
the construction and manufacturing
industries in which the CFMEU is involved, it may be taken, are vital to
Australia's economy and
the well-being of its citizens and residents. Ensuring
that the CFMEU is an effective, responsible and lawful participant in
Australia's
industrial system and in the industries in which the CFMEU is
involved and combatting and remedying the risk of criminal infiltration
affairs is readily characterisable as an essential and necessary objective of
importance to the nation.
2A of Ch 11 also has other in-built safeguards against any unnecessary
intrusion into the freedom of political communication.
They include not only
s 323K(1) (the effect of which has been described above), but also the
legislative sunset provision in s 323E
(providing that ss 323A, 323B,
323C and 323D cease to be in force on the fifth anniversary of the day the
administration began under
s 323A(1)) and s 323A(2) (which provides
that the administration ends on the fifth anniversary of the day it began
(unless ended
sooner under s 323D)). Section 323D(1) and (1A) also enable
the administrator to request the Minister to vary or revoke a scheme
under s 323B(1) and if the Minister is satisfied that, having regard to the
Parliament's intention in enacting the
, the variation or revocation is
in the public interest, the Minister must, in writing, vary or revoke the
scheme. This power is subject
, by which the Minister must not
vary or revoke a scheme "before the third anniversary of the day the
administration began, unless
the administrator gives the Minister written notice
that the administrator is satisfied that (for variation) the branch, or (for
revocation) the Construction and General Division and each of its branches, is
functioning lawfully and effectively".
summary, in gauging the reasonableness of the means Parliament chose to achieve
its legitimate objectives, it is relevant that:
Ch 11 can achieve those objectives; (b) along the spectrum between a
law directly restricting political communications and a law
merely having some
incidental effect of restricting political communications,
Ch 11 is somewhere in the middle; (c) there is no obvious and
compelling alternative means to achieve the same objects, having
a clearly less
restrictive effect on freedom of political communication; (d) the
circumstances with which the Parliament was confronted
in respect of the CFMEU,
in terms of an unprecedented scale of repeated contraventions of industrial
legislation and serious allegations
of criminal associations within the C&G
Division and of serious criminal conduct, required swift and effective remedial
given the importance of the CFMEU to the Australian economy and the
well-being of its citizens and residents, and to the effective
functioning of
Australia's industrial system; and (e)
of Ch 11 has
in-built safeguards against any unnecessary intrusion into the freedom.
these reasons it must be concluded that
of Ch 11, properly
construed (including in accordance with
Acts Interpretation
), satisfies the second limb of the
test – it is reasonably appropriate and adapted to achieve its
legitimate ends, objects or purposes of: (a) providing an effective
quick response to allegations of serious and extensive criminal and unlawful
conduct and mismanagement by officers of the C&G
Division; and
(b) swiftly restoring the effective management and operation of the C&G
Division. Accordingly,
of Ch 11 can be described as suitable,
necessary and adequate in its balance in respect of its legitimate objects.
of Ch 11 of the
, and therefore the Scheme, are not invalid by
operation of the implied freedom of political
communication.
Other challenges to validity
Extra-judicial punishment in contravention of Ch III?
impugned provisions, which ultimately involved a focus on
, do not infringe Ch III of the
Constitution
because they do not involve the imposition of punishment within the scope of
exclusive judicial power. They are not prima facie punitive
in character and, in
any event, they are reasonably capable of being seen as necessary for the
legitimate and non-punitive purposes

property and affairs of an organisation, terminating
a person's employment,
vacating an office held by a person, or restricting a person's capacity to hold
certain offices can constitute
extra-judicial
and thereby
infringe Ch III of the
Constitution
, which permits the judicial
power of the Commonwealth to be exercised only by Ch III courts.
of Ch 11 of the
enables the imposition of each of
these serious detriments on the C&G Division and the officers of that
Division because, by
, it empowers the Minister to determine a
scheme for the C&G Division, if the Minister is satisfied that, having
regard to the
Parliament's intention in enacting the
, it is in the
public interest for the Division and its branches to be placed under
administration. Further, by
s 323B(3)(a)
, (b), (c) and (f), such a scheme
must provide for, respectively, the person who is to be appointed as the
administrator of the scheme
, suspension or removal of
officers, declarations that offices are vacant, and the termination of
employment of employees of the C&G
Division or its branches. Once the
C&G Division is placed under administration by the determination of the
scheme and the appointment
of an administrator, the other provisions of
of Ch 11, including
, operate according to their
to the submissions for the plaintiffs, however, the enactment of
Ch 11 did not involve the Parliament in adjudging that the C&G Division
or any of its officers had committed unlawful conduct
for which they should be
punished. As discussed, the circumstances which called forth the legislation
included the courts having
found that the CFMEU and some of its officers had
committed contraventions of industrial legislation and the existence of serious
allegations of criminal and improper conduct by the C&G Division and some of
its officers. The Parliament did not and did not
need to decide that these
allegations had been proved to enact
of Ch 11. The amelioration
of and safeguarding against risk is central to the legislative function. That
the Parliament was doing
so in respect of the serious allegations, including of
criminal infiltration of the CFMEU, is exposed by the Second Reading Speech,
which the Minister said that the "Australian government takes these allegations
seriously".
the provisions of
of Ch 11 indicate the legislative intention
that the administrator should conduct such investigations as may be required to
the truth or otherwise of the serious allegations and any other issues
of concern about the management of the C&G Division. Therefore,
requires the administrator, as soon as practicable after appointment as
administrator, to establish, in writing, a complaints procedure
and to take
reasonable steps to publicise the procedure to members of the C&G Division
and make the procedure publicly available
(s 323HA(1)).
The procedure must
allow for the making of complaints in respect of conduct of relevant persons
within the C&G Division that
is or is alleged to be improper, unlawful or
(s 323HA(2)).
The complaint recipient may refer a complaint to a
law enforcement agency or regulator (including the Fair Work Ombudsman or the
General Manager of the FWC) for investigation
(s 323HA(5)).
Otherwise, the
complaint recipient must use best endeavours to investigate the complaint
(s 323HA(8)).
In addition, by
, the administrator may
undertake investigations into past practices of the C&G Division and its
branches. By
the "administrator also has the function of
promoting compliance by the Construction and General Division with the laws
workplace laws) of the Commonwealth, the States and the
Territories".
the face of these matters, the plaintiffs' submission that the Parliament must
have determined that the C&G Division had engaged
in unlawful conduct for
which it and some of its officers should be punished is unsustainable. The
circumstances are that numerous
past contraventions of industrial laws have
already been the subject of judicial determinations, and the serious allegations
proposed by the legislation to be the subject of investigation and may then
be the subject of future judicial determination. If anything,
therefore, the
legislation recognises that it is for the judiciary alone to determine the
existence of any contravention of law and
the consequences of any such
contravention including, if authorised, punishment of the contraveners.
of Ch 11 also does not effect a forfeiture of the property of the C&G
Division. It has been said that the "[f]orfeiture or confiscation
of property,
in connection with the commission of serious crime, has a long history in
English law".

can it be said that, by enabling the employment of officers to be terminated and
their offices vacated and restricting the future
roles of "removed persons", the
legislation is a bill of pains and penalties. As has been said, laws can be so
characterised if they

breach by some person of some antecedent standard of conduct" and "legislative

of a registered organisation without a certificate) and
(restrictions on removed persons being bargaining representatives) also
is insufficient to characterise
of Ch 11 as punitive.
protective purpose of those provisions is evident from their operation. The
restrictions in Div 2 of
of Ch 11, accordingly, do not
apply if the removed person holds a certificate under s 323MC or
s 323MD as applicable. A certificate
under s 323MC or s 323MD may
be granted to a removed person on application by the FWC if the FWC is satisfied
that the person is
"a fit and proper person" to hold office in or to be employed
by a registered organisation respectively. Further,
, which prevents a removed person being a bargaining representative, contains
, which provides that the FWC may, on application in writing by a
removed person, grant the person a certificate to be a bargaining
representative, if satisfied that the person is a fit and proper person to be a
bargaining representative. While the certificate
provisions exclude the grant of
a certificate if the removed person has been disqualified under a scheme and the
period of the disqualification
has not ended or at any time while the removed
person is not eligible to be a candidate for an election, or to be elected or
to an office in a registered organisation under
(which disqualifies persons convicted of a prescribed offence from
being a candidate for an election, or to be elected or appointed,
to an office
in a registered organisation), those exclusions are relatively narrow in scope
and not in absolute terms. These safeguards

circumstances where the parties framed their submissions in this case solely by
reference to the approach in
, I will apply structured
proportionality as a "tool of analysis" and accordingly address suitability,
necessity and adequacy. However,
at least in this case an analysis of all those
criteria reduces to the same point; namely, that the extent of the burden on the
freedom imposed by the impugned provisions is that which follows from
the (temporary) loss of member control over the affairs and
assets of a division
of a union and that this loss of control is a reasonable means of rendering that
division lawful and effective
(ie, the impugned provisions are reasonably
appropriate and adapted to advance a legitimate purpose). Otherwise, nothing has
in this case or in
to warrant any reconsideration of the
existence of the implied freedom.
Approach to assessing validity
of Ch 11 and the Determination
second question of law posed in the special case asks whether, inter alia,
of Ch 11 is invalid because it impermissibly burdens the implied
freedom. The third question is in the same terms but concerns the
validity of
the Determination made under
Commonwealth and the Attorney‑General of the Commonwealth ("the
Commonwealth defendants") contended that the nature and
extent of any burden on
the implied freedom arising from
of Ch 11 depends on the terms
of any scheme that might be determined under
and how any
administrator might exercise his or her powers and functions. According to the
Commonwealth defendants, it followed that
questions 2 and 3 fold into a
single inquiry into whether the making of the Determination exceeded the powers
conferred by
of Ch 11 because those powers are to be construed
as not authorising the imposition of unjustified burdens on political
communications.
it is not a difference of substance, I consider that the focus of the inquiry in
this case is the validity of
of Ch 11 and not the Determination.
As explained below, the substantive features of a scheme determined under
of Ch 11 that bear on the assessment whether an
unjustifiable burden is imposed on the implied freedom are: (i) the appointment
the administrator;
(ii) the conferral on the administrator of broad powers of control over the
affairs and property of the Construction and General
Division ("the
C & G Division") of the Construction, Forestry and Maritime
Employees Union ("the
(iii) the duties imposed on the administrator when exercising those powers

The extent of
such suspensions, removals and declarations may vary from scheme to scheme.
However, even those officers who are not
removed or suspended are subject to the
direction and control of the administrator, not of the members of the
C & G Division.
As explained below, it is the members' loss of
control over the affairs of the C & G Division and the other
features just noted
that are material.
as will be explained, while the administrator is conferred with broad functions
and powers, the exercise of those functions
and powers is limited by duties that
require their exercise in a manner that has regard to the objects of the CFMEU.
Whether or not
the implied freedom is unjustifiably impaired is not dependent on
any particular exercise of any function or power by the administrator
otherwise authorised by Pt 2A of Ch 11.
contrary to the Commonwealth defendants' submission, the power to determine a
scheme under s 323B is not so broad as to permit
some exercises of that
power that are within constitutional limits and others that are
Instead, all
exercises of the power to determine a scheme under s 323B are either valid
or invalid and that is so because Pt 2A of
Ch 11 is either valid or
invalid in its entirety in all its applications.

on such donations burdens the implied

third parties such as trade unions effects a greater
burden on the implied

restrictions on freedom of association, including
legislative limits imposed on

an assessment of the nature and extent of the burden is only relevant to the
second and third stages of the
those matters
are conveniently addressed at the point of determining whether the implied
freedom is burdened. In this case, three
particular features of the
C & G Division and Pt 2A of Ch 11 warrant the conclusion
that the implied freedom is burdened (and
demonstrate the nature and extent of
that burden), namely: the nature of the C & G Division's (and
the CFMEU's) activities so
far as political communication is concerned, the fact
that those activities are ultimately conducted on behalf of the members of

relation to the conduct by the C & G Division of those
activities.

feature of Pt 2A of Ch 11, critical to its validity, is that in
exercising control over the property and affairs of the
G Division the administrator must "have regard to the
objects of the CFMEU as defined in the" CFMEU
including the
political objects noted above.
Pt 2A of Ch 11, the administrator is conferred with the control of the
property and affairs of the C & G Division and its

Territories
ensuring that its officers and employees comply with their obligations under the
relation to these functions and powers and any other functions and powers of the
administrator,
"In performing functions and exercising powers as administrator, the
administrator must:
(a) be satisfied the administrator is acting in the best interests of the
members of the Construction and General Division and its
branches; and
(b) have regard to the
objects of the CFMEU as defined in the rules of the
at the commencement of
section 323A
, so far as they are lawful."
(emphasis added)
first of these duties is awkwardly expressed but its effect is that the
administrator must act in what the administrator considers
to be the best
interests of the members of the C & G Division and its Branches; a
formulation that corresponds to a duty imposed
of these duties obliges the administrator, when performing functions and
exercising powers, to have regard to the objects
of the CFMEU as defined in the
CFMEU Rules, including those objects noted above. The requirement to have regard
to those objects
means they must be "give[n] weight ... as a fundamental
element" in performance of the administrator's functions and the exercise

provisions enable the administrator to manage the affairs and property of the
C & G Division by furthering the CFMEU's
objects as defined in the
CFMEU Rules, including the political objects described above, such as by making
political donations. However,
they are not merely facultative. The conferral of
broad powers to manage the affairs and property of the C & G

Section 323F
potentially undermines the significance of the reference to the "objects of the
CFMEU as defined in [its] rules" in
s 323K(5)(b). Section 323F
provides that the scheme for the administration determined under s 323B,
any action taken under the scheme
and an instrument of appointment of an
administrator made under s 323C have effect despite any provision of the
Fair Work Act
(Cth) or the
CFMEU Rules or the rules of any of the CFMEU's Branches or Divisions. This
provision confirms the administrator's control
over the affairs and property of
the C & G Division notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
in the CFMEU Rules and the
C & G Division Rules. However, whether
s 323F has any effect on the duties imposed by s 323K(5) beyond that
depends on the scope
of any scheme that might be made under s 323B.
matters a scheme must provide for are specified in s 323B(3) and, as noted,
include the suspension or removal of officers, declarations
that offices are
vacant and the timing of election of
must also provide for the alteration of the C & G Division
by the administrator
in circumstances where, because of the
administration, the alteration cannot be made in accordance with any provision
made by [the]
Act (other than [Pt 2A of Ch 11]) or the
neither that power nor anything else in Pt 2A of Ch 11 enables a
scheme or an administrator to alter the objects of the
CFMEU as defined in the
CFMEU Rules as in force when Pt 2A commenced.
if an administrator attempted to exercise the power conferred by a scheme to
alter the C & G Division Rules to restrict
the Division from
being managed and its assets being deployed in furtherance of the objects of the
CFMEU then the administrator's
actions would be inconsistent with the obligation
to have regard to those objects as required by s 323K(5)(b) and would mean
the administrator could not be satisfied that he or she had acted in the
best interests of members as required by s 323K(5)(a). The
administrator
could not amend the C & G Division Rules to eliminate so much of
them that gives effect to the objects of the CFMEU
when the administrator is
obliged to exercise that power of amendment having regard to those very same
while the Minister has the power to include other matters in a scheme beyond the
matters mandated in
power could not be exercised to confer on an administrator powers to alter the
CFMEU Rules or powers that are inconsistent with
end result is that neither a scheme made under s 323B, nor action taken
under a scheme, nor the valid exercise of powers of the
administrator conferred
by any scheme made under s 323B(1) can remove or limit the administrator's
obligation to administer the C
& G Division in the best
interests of the members and to have regard to the objects of the CFMEU as they
existed at the time
of the commencement of s 323A. As noted, those objects
include the undertaking of various forms of political communication and making
political donations.
The burden imposed
follows that Pt 2A of Ch 11 burdens the implied freedom of political
communication, but that burden is different to that which
would have been
occasioned had the C & G Division's assets simply been seized, had
the Division been wound up or had the Division
otherwise been removed from the
CFMEU structure altogether. In such a case the nature and extent of the burden
would include that
which resulted from the C & G Division's
affairs and assets no longer being able to be managed and deployed to further
the political
objects of the CFMEU.
the relevant burden is that which flows from the loss of the members' control
over the management of the C & G Division's
affairs and its
assets, being the (significant) impeding of their capacity to meaningfully
engage in political communication through
the C & G Division
or use the C & G Division's assets to donate to others to do so.
As explained, the members are not without
remedies against the administrator in
that they can approach the courts to scrutinise the administrator's actions.
However, recourse
against an administrator akin to that available against a
trustee with broad powers of management and control over property the subject
a trust is very different to exercising such management and control over a
registered organisation and its property through elected
officials. That
recourse is no substitute for the level of control conferred on members (and
their elected officials) over the property
and affairs of the
C & G Division by the CFMEU Rules, the
C & G Division Rules and the balance of the

Commonwealth defendants contended that the purpose of
was to enable the C & G Division to be returned swiftly to a
state in which it is governed and operates lawfully and
effectively in its
members' interests for the goal of facilitating the operation of the federal
workplace relations system. This
purpose was said to be apparent from the
provisions of
of Ch 11, especially

Commonwealth defendants' contention as to the purpose of
Ch 11 is supported by these provisions as well as the duties imposed on the
administrator described above. The existence of this
purpose is also supported
by the Revised Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill which, upon its passage,
introduced Pt 2A of Ch 11 into
("the Bill"). The
Revised Explanatory Memorandum referred to the existence of serious allegations
of corrupt and criminal conduct
on the part of C & G Division
officials, and stated that the CFMEU had been the subject of established
contraventions of federal
workplace laws on more than 1500 occasions since

special case recounts facts and circumstances that support those
statements.
plaintiffs did not dispute that at least
purpose of Pt 2A of
Ch 11 is that contended for by the Commonwealth defendants and that such a
purpose is legitimate, in the sense
that it is compatible with the maintenance
of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative government. However,
the plaintiffs
contended that Pt 2A of Ch 11 had an additional
purpose, namely the suppression of political donations and activity by the
G Division, a purpose that is incompatible with the
implied freedom.
demonstrate this additional purpose, the plaintiffs referred to the history of
the passage of Pt 2A of Ch 11 through Parliament,
as described by
high point of that history is the statements made in the Senate by opposition
senators to the effect that they would not support
the Bill unless it was
amended to ban political donations made by the
Other Members
of Parliament later told the House of Representatives that they would vote in
favour of the Bill because of written
statements made by the third defendant,
prior to his appointment as
administrator.
plaintiffs contended that the Bill's history demonstrates that the banning of
political donations was one of the objects that
Pt 2A of Ch 11 sought
to "achieve in fact".
letter containing the statements made by the third defendant referred to in the
parliamentary debates was attached to the special
case. In that letter, the
third defendant stated that he had determined a set of "principles and goals" to
guide him should the Bill
pass, and he be appointed as administrator. One of
those principles was that the "union", presumably being the
C & G Division,
"will not engage in party politics during the
administration: donations; positions at political party conferences; promotion
of particular
candidates". One of those goals was that, if he were appointed as
administrator, he would vary the C & G Division Rules "to
the making of party-political donations or the funding of
party-political campaigns".
references in the parliamentary debates to the third defendant's letter and its
contents may suffice to enable the letter to be
relied on for the purposes of
ascertaining the purpose of
in the plaintiffs' favour that the letter can be relied on to ascertain the
purpose of Pt 2A, it follows from the above
that the letter does not
properly reflect the effect of Pt 2A. The third defendant, as
administrator, does not have the power to
make an alteration to the
C & G Division Rules to prohibit donations to political parties or
the funding of party political campaigns.
The third defendant cannot fetter his
powers in managing the C & G Division's affairs and property by
excluding the
possibility
of the C & G Division giving
effect to the political objects of the CFMEU including by preventing the
C & G Division from
ever engaging in "party politics", taking
positions at political party conferences or promoting particular candidates or
(including making donations). Instead, the third defendant must give
genuine consideration to whether it is in the interests of members
to take those
steps, although it must be accepted that their capacity to obtain relief
requiring the third defendant to take those
steps is limited.
is a difference between ascertaining the meaning and purpose of legislation with
the assistance of extrinsic materials such
as parliamentary debates and
discovering the motives of individual legislators in voting in favour of that
legislation. The former
is the relevant inquiry and the latter is irrelevant.
The starting point, and in some cases the end point, for ascertaining the
and purpose of legislation is the text and effect of the legislation.
The secondary materials including the parliamentary debates
may assist in
ascertaining that meaning and
where the text of the legislation is opaque, or it confers broad and
unconstrained powers that could be exercised significantly
and selectively to
burden the implied freedom.
in this case, the parliamentary statements relied on by the plaintiffs do not
rise above explaining why particular Members
of Parliament voted in favour of
the Bill. Those statements find no reflection in any part of the text of
Pt 2A and throw no light
on the meaning or effect of any provision of
Pt 2A. To the contrary, those statements proceed on an incorrect
understanding of the
scope of the powers conferred on the administrator by the
Bill upon its enactment.
follows that the plaintiffs' submission as to the supposed (additional) purpose
of Pt 2A of Ch 11 should not be accepted. The
purpose of Pt 2A is
as submitted by the Commonwealth defendants and that purpose is compatible with
the implied freedom.
Is the law reasonably appropriate and
adapted to advance its purpose?
plaintiffs contended that, even if the Commonwealth defendants' submissions as
to the purpose of Pt 2A of Ch 11 were accepted,
Pt 2A was not
suitable for its purpose, necessary or adequate in its balance.
relation to suitability, Pt 2A of Ch 11 has a rational connection to
its purpose. It provides a swift mechanism to address the
unlawful actions of
the C & G Division and a means of rendering the
C & G Division effective, and limits the period in which
is to occur.
for whether Pt 2A of Ch 11 is necessary, the plaintiffs contended that
there was an alternative, reasonably practicable means
of achieving the same
purpose with a less restrictive effect on the implied freedom; namely, that
provided for in
. That provision enables an
application to be made to the Federal Court of Australia for the approval of a
scheme for the taking of
action for the reconstitution of a branch of an
organisation or to enable that branch to function
effectively.
General Manager of the Fair Work Commission had already made such an application
in relation to the C & G Division when the
Bill was passed. The plaintiffs'
submission to the effect that this method was a reasonably practicable means of
achieving the same
purpose as Pt 2A with a less restrictive effect on the
implied freedom was premised on the administrator appointed under Pt 2A
the power to preclude the C & G Division from engaging
in political activity. The plaintiffs contended that a scheme approved
Court under s 323 could only have that effect if permitted by the Court to
the reasons already explained, this submission overstates the administrator's
powers under Pt 2A of Ch 11. The predecessor to
s 323 enabled the
Court to include in a scheme a power to amend the rules of a registered
organisation if that amendment was necessary
or appropriate to reconstitute the
organisation.
scheme for the taking of action imposed on a part of a registered organisation
by the Federal Court under s 323(2), and a
scheme determined under
Pt 2A, remove control of the C & G Division from its members.
However, neither form of scheme necessarily
burdens the implied freedom any more
than the other.
similar reasons, Pt 2A of Ch 11 is adequate in its balance. While the
extent of the burden imposed on the implied freedom is
significant, it must be
considered in light of the undoubted importance of the purpose of Pt 2A of
apparent and immediate means of addressing the
C & G Division's unlawful actions and dysfunction is
subjecting it to
external control. The burden imposed on the implied freedom by
Pt 2A is commensurate with that loss of control and Pt 2A goes no
further in burdening the implied freedom than removing member control. Had
Pt 2A gone further by, for example, enabling the taking
of the steps
proposed in the third defendant's letter, the outcome of this aspect of the
plaintiffs' challenge may have been different.
Neither the content of the
parliamentary debates nor the special case suggests that any aspect of the
dysfunction or unlawful behaviour
of the C & G Division was
related to its undertaking of political communication or its support of
political communication undertaken
by others. A legislative prohibition on that
activity would not appear to be related to the purpose of Pt 2A of
of Ch 11 of the

its purpose, being a purpose that is compatible with the implied freedom of
