REASONS FOR DECISION:
Introduction
This is an application made pursuant to
section 72(8) of the
Queensland Building Services Authority
(“the QBSA Act”). The Queensland Building Services Authority
(“the authority”) argues that in the circumstances
particular case there is sufficient reason for extending the time for giving a
direction to rectify beyond the six years
and three months period prescribed by
the QBSA Act. The application is opposed by the first respondent. The second
respondent has
not appeared.
On 6 July 1995 the Council of the Shire of
Whitsunday certified that the building known as “Sailz Whitsunday”
substantially completed.
In 1997 the authority issued a direction
to rectify to Patrick O’Brien. Mr O’Brien did not undertake the
rectification.
The authority subsequently made a claim against Mr O’Brien
under the Statutory Insurance Scheme. The authority took action
O’Brien in the tribunal.
The authority conceded on the second day
of the hearing that on 6 June 1997 Mr O’Brien gave one of its officers a
copy of the
contract between himself, Mr Holloway and the first and second
respondent in these proceedings dated 9 September 1997.
The action against Mr O’Brien was
resolved by agreement on 11 November 1997. In that agreement Vinbridge Pty Ltd
(the second
respondent in these proceedings) agreed to pay the authority $1,950,
being the monies the authority had claimed from Mr O’Brien.
O’Brien, Vinbridge Pty Ltd and Mr D’Rozario (the first respondent in
these proceedings) all agreed to be bound by
the agreement dated 9 September
1997 with Mr O’Brien to be responsible for outside structural construction
In August 2000 the authority issued 16
directions to rectify to Mr O’Brien all relating to Sailz.
In November 2000 Mr O’Brien filed
review proceedings in respect of those directions. When the matter first came
on for hearing
the authority conceded that it had been aware from the time of
service of application Q099-00 that Mr O’Brien alleged that
physically carry out the building work the subject of any of the directions to
rectify, but that the responsibility and
work was carried out by the first and
second respondents in these proceedings.
On 6 October 2001 the time for issuing
directions to rectify expired.
On 13 March 2002 I reversed the directions
to rectify that had been issued to Mr O’Brien. The authority appealed to
the District
On 22 May 2002 the authority filed this
application pursuant to section 72(8) of the QBSA Act.
On 15 November 2002 McGill DCJ held that
it was not appropriate to direct Mr O’Brien to rectify the defects
(paragraph 52 of
Queensland Building Services Authority v O’Brien and
[2002] QDC).
The applicant relied on a statement of
Norman Bergin, building inspector. Mr Bergin was not required for cross
examination.
The first respondent relied on a
statement of Darren Ho, his solicitor. Mr Ho was not required for cross
examination.
Submissions
The solicitors for the first respondent
handed up written submissions on 24 January 2003, when the matter was listed for
It was apparent from those submissions that they had not been fully
instructed in respect of the history of the proceedings and
consequently the
hearing was adjourned in order that they might take further instructions.
Subsequently they submitted that it was
clear that from August 1997 that the authority had the agreement between Mr
and the respondents and had considered the legal effect of the
agreement. Thus they submitted that over 4 years prior to the expiry
year 3 month limitation period the authority knew that the second respondent and
through it the first respondent, might
be persons against whom the directions to
rectify could have been issued.
The applicant submitted that the only
special circumstance operative in this case was the uncertainty of the meaning
of section 72(14)
of the QBSA Act.
In reply the first respondent submitted
that even if there were uncertainty it could have been addressed by issuing the
within time as a cautious course of action.
A number of previous decisions of this
tribunal provide guidance as to how the discretion given by section 72(8) of the
QBSA Act should
be exercised. The first proceeding in which the discretion was
considered was
Queensland Building Services Authority v JP Constructions Pty
(unreported, D012-1993, 11 May 1993). In that case Member Wensley QC
ruled that the onus was on the authority to demonstrate that
there was a
sufficient reason to extend the time and that this onus should be discharged to
the civil standard, that is on the balance
of probabilities. He accepted the
submission that relevant considerations on the exercise of the discretion
“a) When the alleged defective or incomplete
work was carried out;
Whether there has been any
delay by the authority in making the application for an extension of
Whether there is
evidence to establish the right of the authority to give a direction pursuant to
section 72(1) apart from the expiry
of the limitation
Whether the exercise
of the discretion will promote the attainment of the specified objects of the
Mr Wensley observed that the tenor of the
legislation was that a direction to extend time normally would not be given
after six years
and three months and that an order for extending the time would
be an exceptional circumstance. He said that the tribunal must be
not just that there is some reason, but a sufficient reason, that is one which
takes the case so far out of the realm
of the primary position that it is
appropriate to make an exception. He gave an instance of the circumstances
which might involve
the exercise of the discretion as deliberate concealment by
a builder of defective work in circumstances where he knew such work
to cause problems for the owner of the building, but not for some time. He
expressed the view that the owner’s
conduct may be relevant, just as the
builder’s conduct may be relevant. He gave the instance of a consumer who
deliberately
delayed in making a complaint, which was a factor that he thought
should be taken into account in deciding whether there was sufficient
Queensland Building Services
Authority v McDonnell
(unreported, D288-94, 1 November 1994), Member Burke
noted that there was little doubt that there was no reason for the delay in
issuing the direction other than the authority’s failure to place
importance on the fact that there was a time limit by which
the direction might
be issued. She expressed the opinion that the expression “sufficient
reason” describes “a
flexible discretionary power”, but one
requiring a case to be made upon ground sufficient to justify a departure in
circumstances from the ordinary rule. In her view the flexibility in
the exercise of the discretion had to be tailored to encapsulate
the intent and
framework of the Act.
Other than for general statements of
principle, the decided cases provide no assistance in the exercise of my
discretion in this case.
I find that the authority was aware of
the possibility that either or both of the respondents might have been potential
of a direction to rectify since 1997. Section 72(14) was not enacted
until October 1999. McGill DCJ said that the function of section
little more than emphasis of factors to be considered under section 72(1). It
can hardly have been uncertainty about
the operation of the subsection that
prevented it from issuing directions to the respondents.
The only reason that I can see for the
authority’s failure to issue directions to the respondents within the
statutory time
limit was that it did not believe Mr O’Brien when he
claimed that he was not the person who should receive the directions.
position of the respondents had been known to the authority since June 1997 when
it received the agreement.
The application is refused. In the
circumstances I can see no reason why the authority should not pay the costs of
the first respondent,
to be agreed or failing agreement to be
