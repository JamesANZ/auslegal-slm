Response provided by Deputy Secretary - Clinical Quality, Regulation and Accreditation received 25 October 2024
For some time, it has been a requirement by the Department of Health that a summary of the patient’s care including medication changes
(separation summary) is provided to the nominated GP for every admission at the time of discharge or if not possible within forty-eight
hours of discharge. The timeliness of this information is audited. This information was not previously routinely seen by pharmacists.
Improvements since this case in 2020, include changes to the computer systems that are used by medical staff to prepare and transmit
discharge summaries.  These include:
*All Discharge summaries now go to My HealthRecord (MyHR), provided the patient has not opted out.  A community pharmacist can routinely
look at any patient’s uploaded discharge
summaries.  Whilst this functionality existed in 2020, it was less common for pharmacies to use MyHR to review patient information.
*Since November 2021 a curated “Pharmacist Shared Medication List (PSML)” is issued for a patient at the THS.   PSMLs are automatically
transmitted to MyHR, provided the patient has consented to their information being uploaded.  This list can be used by community
pharmacies to understand patients’ hospital medication management.
Since patients do not typically have one-to-one relationships with their community pharmacy it is not possible to send discharge summaries
routinely to specific pharmacies (unless advised by the
patient). However, all community pharmacies can now retrieve information from the MyHR.
All medication changes made in the hospital are considered critical given they typically relate to safety or efficacy and are reflected
in the Discharge Summary.
