Mr Michael Pearson, Legal Officer with Queensland Racing

REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr Leo G Williams AO - Chairman
The Hon Sir James Killen - Deputy
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
This is an appeal by
Licensed Trainer Mr Darryl Caldwell against the penalty imposed by the
South-East Queensland Racing Association
Appeals Sub-Committee (SEQRA) on 18
November 2002. SEQRA reduced the period of six months disqualification imposed
by the Stewards
to a four months disqualification. The six months
disqualification was imposed on 8 November 2002 and concerned Mr Caldwell, as
the trainer of Skimblehanks presenting that horse to race at the Gold Coast Turf
Club on 5 October 2002 in Race 8. From the blood
sample that was taken from the
horse prior to running there was detected an elevated TCO2 level.
Rule of Racing of which Mr Calder was charged was Australian Rule 178 which
“When any horse has been brought to a racecourse for the
purpose of engaging in a race and a prohibited substance is detected
sample taken from it prior to or following its running in any race, the trainer
and/or any other person who was in charge
of such horse at any relevant time
maybe punished.”
Australian Rule of Racing 178 is commonly referred
to as the “presentation rule” and it is noted the current wording of
AR178 replaced the previous wording on 1 October 2002. The previous wording of
the rule stated that a person could have a “defence”
he satisfies the Committee of the Club or the Stewards that he had taken all
proper precautions to prevent the administration
of the prohibited
substance”.
Mr Caldwell entered the plea of guilty to the charge
at the Stewards inquiry.
Both at the Stewards inquiry and the SEQRA
Appeal it was accepted that there was no evidence of administration of a
prohibited substance
by Mr Caldwell.
This Appeal concerns the matter of
penalty and in both the submissions by Mr Morrow and Mr Pearson a list of
previous penalties concerning
elevated TCO2 levels were presented to the
There has only been one instance of elevated TCO2 levels
concerning thoroughbreds which has come before this Authority and that is
appeal by the Stewards concerning trainer Mr Lawrence Manzelmann of 10 January
2002. In that Appeal Trainer Manzelmann was initially
disqualified by the
Stewards for eight months which was reduced by the North Queensland Racing
Association Appeals Committee to a
two months suspension and a fine of $3,000.
The Authority allowed the appeal by the Stewards and varied the penalty to four
disqualification. It is noted however in that decision that Mr
Manzelmann’s actual breach of the rules was for the offence
of a breach of
Rule 175 and that the NQRA Appeals Committee dealt with Mr Manzelmann wrongly
under AR178. Mr Manzelmann’s
matter concerned the case of administration.
Mr Morrow submitted that Mr Caldwell shall be dealt with at the
“lower end of the scale” and submitted that the SEQRA
concerning Trainer MacRae of 25 May 1999 in which a two months suspension and
$2,000 fine was imposed concerning the horse
Heavenly Thought was the lower end
of the scale.
Correctly Mr Pearson pointed out that the penalty imposed
on Trainer MacRae could be extinguished because Heavenly Thought was scratched
pre race while in this case Skimblehanks actually won the race and those members
of the public that had backed the placed horses
could rightly feel aggrieved.
The other SEQRA case referred to the Authority which could be considered
at the lower end of the scale was the matter involving Trainer
Searle and the
horse Touch of Sanity of 27 August 2002 in which a four months disqualification
was on appeal to SEQRA reduced to
four months suspension and a $1,000 fine. Mr
Pearson advised that the circumstances of this matter involved the trainer being
part time trainer but also a journalist who was required to attend race
meetings in connection with her employment.
In this appeal we have Mr
Caldwell who states that he has been in the industry for 40 years having first
started when he was 13 years
of age in Indonesia and holding a trainer’s
licence for 32 years. Mr Caldwell has had no prior convictions and from the
submissions
made for him the total monetary cost of lost earnings and payment of
prize money to the owners would be around $25,000. Mr Caldwell
trains full time
with one owner paying him on a retainer basis and he receiving training fees
from four other horses.
In addition to his training activities Mr
Caldwell presented to the Authority a letter from Sweetbulk Marketing Pty Ltd.
That company
is involved in distributing horse feeds and veterinary supplies and
Mr Caldwell has an interest in the business which although minor
at this stage
would cease completely if disqualification was imposed as Mr Caldwell could not
attend licensed stables.
It is trite to say that it is incumbent on all
those involved in the racing industry to ensure that the industry is drug free.
TCO2 levels are of concern particularly when it often can be considered
a masking agent.
The Authority however believes that because of Mr
Caldwell’s long period as a licensee without any convictions and his other
activities in the industry that this is an appropriate case in which a
suspension rather than a disqualification should be imposed.
Authority imposes a penalty of six months suspension from the date of the
Stewards original decision. The Authority also imposes
a fine of $1,000 which
is required to be paid within 30 days failing which the four months
disqualification will be reinstated.
The appeal fee is
