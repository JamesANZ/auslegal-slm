Allegedly unauthorised disclosure of information based on exemption [2005] NSWPrivCmr 3 (1 January 2005)
Allegedly unauthorised disclosure of information based on
Ms M had utilised the services of a child care organisation for some
time, specifically their overnight child care service. Suddenly
she was advised
by the scheme’s coordinator that she did not work enough hours to be
entitled to overnight child care.
Ms M explained to the Coordinator that
she worked in more than one job. She was required to request two of her
employers to provide
letters confirming her employment with them to the child
care organisation in order to remain eligible for overnight care.
Coordinator subsequently contacted those employers, enquiring further as to Ms
M’s employment status with those businesses.
Ms M alleged that one of
those enquiries was made to a staff member of one of those organisations rather
than to its management or
authorised delegate. She complained about this alleged
breach of her privacy. One week after making this complaint to the child care
organisation, Ms M’s employers were contacted by Centrelink which
requested each organisation to provide a statement of Ms
According to Ms M, the child care organisation was the only
party that was aware that she worked in both of those organisations. She
therefore made the allegation that the child care organisation had provided
Centrelink with this information.
complaint from Ms M about:
1. Inappropriate means of collection of information about her by the child care
organisation by contacting her employers directly
without her consent, and
2. Inappropriate use of that information by the child care organisation by
writing to Centrelink about her employment with those
businesses.
After being advised of her options, Ms M chose to
refer the matter for internal review. In its review, the State Government
organisation
agreed that Ms M’s employers had been contacted by the child
care organisation, but they disagreed that any enquiries were
non-authorised staff member. Notes kept by the child care organisation staff
suggested that a message had been left with
one of the employer’s staff
members to have a manager call back in regard to the matter.
of the PPIP Act (IPP 2) requires that a public sector agency must, in collecting
personal information, collect the information
directly from the individual to
whom the information relates, unless that individual has authorised collection
of the information
from someone else.
As noted earlier, when the child
care organisation first questioned Ms M’s eligibility for overnight care,
Ms M needed to ask
each of her employers to send a letter to the child care
organisation verifying her employment. The final line of one letter contained
standard closing invitation to call if there were any enquiries. The
investigating agency was therefore satisfied that the above
invitation provided
sufficient ‘authorisation’ by Ms M for the child care organisation
to contact the employer for the
purposes of section 9 of the Act, since she had
asked her employer to send a letter to the child care organisation.
regard to the letter sent to Centrelink about Ms M’s employment, the
agency conducting the internal review stated that this
disclosure may have not
complied with section 17 "Limits on use of personal information" and section 18
"Limits on disclosure of
personal information" in the PPIP Act.
they noted that such non-compliance is exempted by section 23 "Exemptions
relating to law enforcement and related matters"
of the Act, specifically
subsections (4) and (5):
23 Exemptions relating to law enforcement and related
(4) A public sector agency (whether or not a law
enforcement agency) is not required to comply with section 17 if the use of the
information
concerned for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was
collected is reasonably necessary for law enforcement purposes or
protection of the public revenue.
(5) A public sector agency (whether or not a law enforcement agency) is
not required to comply with section 18 if the disclosure of
the information
(d) is reasonably necessary:
(i) for the protection of the public revenue, or
(ii) in order to investigate an offence where there are reasonable grounds
to believe that an offence may have been committed.
conducting the internal review therefore believed it had acted lawfully and it
was not appropriate to issue an apology
However, in its internal
review recommendations the agency did agree that they should more fully outline
the documentation required
of parents in relation to the authorisation of
overnight care. They also declared their intention to ensure that privacy
provided warnings to parents and carers that the child care organisation
may need to provide information to other government agencies
pursuant to
legislative requirements.
In response to those findings, Privacy NSW
noted the relevance of IPP 3 (section 10) "Requirements when collecting personal
information":
If a public sector agency collects personal information from an individual,
the agency must take such steps as are reasonable in the
circumstances to ensure
that, before the information is collected or as soon as practicable after
collection, the individual to whom
the information relates is made aware of the
(a) the fact that the information is being collected,
(b) the purposes for which the information is being collected,
(c) the intended recipients of the information,
(d) whether the supply of the information by the individual is required by
law or is voluntary, and any consequences for the individual
if the information
(or any part of it) is not provided,
(e) the existence of any right of access to, and correction of, the
information,
(f) the name and address of the agency that is collecting the information and
the agency that is to hold the
information.
While the investigating agency
argued that the letter from Ms M’s employer provided authorisation for it
to contact the businesses
if need be, it is plausible that Ms M could take the
view that the letter only served as a confirmation of her engagement there.
that was the case, then she would have expected notification when an employer
was contacted for further information.
Indeed, the extra effort involved
in advising Ms M that it may be seeking additional information from her employer
might have saved
the organisation from having to conduct the internal review
and, therefore, a great deal of additional time and effort later on.
