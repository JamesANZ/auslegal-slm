MARITIME AFFAIRS
Fresh look for Maritime Studies –
Australian Journal of Maritime and Ocean
Maritime Studies
will soon have a new name. From 2009, it will be
published as the
Australian Journal of Maritime and Ocean Affairs
(AJMOA). The Australian Association for Maritime Affairs has changed the
name in order to emphasise that our areas of interest extend
‘maritime’ domain to every facet of the marine environment,
including all human activities at sea (from tourism
to the exploitation of
seabed resources).
This is the final issue of
Maritime Studies
. Volume 1, no. 1 of its
replacement, the
Australian Journal of Maritime and Ocean Affairs
reach subscribers in the first quarter of 2009. Existing subscribers do not need
to take any action – current subscriptions
will be applied to the new
journal and invoices will be issued when subscriptions are due for renewal.
AJMOA will continue the 27 year tradition of
Maritime Studies
continuing to publish full-length articles and shorter commentaries by academics
and professionals in the field on the wide variety
of marine topics that
interest our broad readership, as well as offering shorter ‘In
Brief’ pieces and book reviews.
All articles will continue to be
‘blind’ refereed by experts in the field.
Call for papers
Australian Journal of Maritime and Ocean Affairs
invites papers
for its forthcoming themed issue,
Shipping in the Asia-Pacific Region
all remain dependent on the ocean and the security and efficiency of shipping
operations. This is especially the case for those
of us in the Asia-Pacific
region. In Australia, for example, 99.9 per cent of trade by volume is carried
by sea. This represents
70 per cent of all trade by value.
AJMOA welcomes the submission of articles (around 5,000-7,000 words) and
commentaries (around 2,000 words) that address topical issues
that affect
shipping in the Asia-Pacific region. Submissions are due 20 April 2009. For
queries, please contact the Editor (below).

The Editorial team welcomes its newest member, Dr Clive Schofield. Clive
holds a prestigious QEII Research Fellowship at the Australian
National Centre
for Ocean Resources and Security (ANCORS) at the University of Wollongong. He is
a political geographer who specialises
in international maritime boundaries.
