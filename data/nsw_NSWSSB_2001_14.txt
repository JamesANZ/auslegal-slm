STRATA SCHEMES MANAGEMENT ACT 1996
APPLICATION NO : SB01/00263
SCHEME : SP61388
ADDRESS OF : "..."
STRATA SCHEME GORDON NSW
APPLICANTS : K Dodds
RESPONDENT : Owners Corporation
Pursuant to
section 158
Strata Schemes Management Act 1996
(the "Act") I order as follows:
1. The by-law set out below is made in respect of Lot 17 in strata plan
Special By-Law No.3 Exclusive Use
The owner for the time being of Lot 17 in Strata Plan 61388 shall have the
exclusive right to use and enjoy that part of the common
property adjacent to
the said Lot 17 as shown on the attached plan (marked ‘A’) as the

conditions are as follows:
(a) The owner shall be subject to the same rights and duties in respect of

2. When this order is recorded in the

accordance with
section 209

61388 must lodge with the Registrar the certificate of title of that strata plan

section 209(2)
of the Act and do all other things required for

RECTIFICATION WORKS
In relation to the application for
orders to be made in respect of rectification works required, that part of the
application is adjourned.
On the basis of the evidence presented to the
Board, I find it is clear that orders need to be made in respect of
rectification work
to ensure that they are carried out and action taken against
the builders to ensure that the owners corporation is not subsequently
the liability of repairing the defects created by others.
However, it is
clear that the nature of the orders that need to be made are such that it would
require the Board to maintain ongoing
review and management of the process.
That is an inappropriate role for the Board to exercise.
That being the
case, I propose to appoint Mr T Wolody of Wolody Strata Management Pty Ltd,
pursuant to
section 162
, to exercise all of the functions of the owners
corporation and of the Chairperson, Secretary, Treasurer and Executive Committee
of the owners corporation for strata scheme SP61388 for a period of 12 months.
This is to ensure that the works required in pursuing
a claim for compensation
for building defects and the rectification of same is commenced and carried out
on behalf of all lot owners
and the owners corporation.
I therefore make
the following orders:
1. The matter of the rectification work is adjourned to a date to be fixed by
the Registry not before 14 September 2001 at which
time an order will be made
appointing a person as a strata managing agent to exercise certain functions of
the owners corporation.
2. Mr T Wolody of Wolody Strata Management Pty Ltd if he wishes to accept the
appointment is to advise the Strata Board in writing
of his consent. Such
consent identifying the terms and conditions (including terms and conditions
relating to remuneration by the
owners corporation) and the duration of the
appointment (up to a period of 12 months) which will be specified in the order
the appointment. Any such submission is to be received by the Tribunal
and a copy sent to the owners corporation on or before 14
3. At the adjourned hearing, any person who may appear or be represented before
the Board pursuant to
section 193
of the Act is invited to make a submission in
relation to:
a) The extent of the functions of the owners corporation that should be
conferred on the strata managing agent appointed, to
b) Any other person to be proposed as a strata managing agent that holds the
qualifications required under
section 162(4)
of the Act, who has consented to
such appointment;
c) The period of time for which such an appointment should be
d) Any restrictions on the power of the Board to make such an
e) Any other matter in relation to the appointment of a strata managing
Any written submission in relation to
this order, is to be made to the Tribunal on or before 1 October 2001.
