REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
1. The worker made a claim for compensation at the end of
December 2020 in relation to a left shoulder condition which had come on
course of serving customers earlier the same month. The claim was supported by
an initial workers compensation medical certificate
dated 22 December 2020. The
initial workers compensation medical certificate made a provisional diagnosis of
“bursitis/AC
arthropathy”, said to be a disease which had occurred
on 6 December 2020. The worker was certified to be fit for suitable
2. The employer accepted the claim for compensation, and commenced
making payments to the worker.
3. The worker continued to deliver
continuing workers compensation medical certificates, which were dated 5 January
2021, 19 January
2021, 10 February 2021, 22 February 2021, 14 April 2021, 3 May
2021, 31 May 2021, 5 July 2021 and 26 July 2021.
4. Upon the delivery of the
workers compensation medical certificate dated 5 July 2021, the employer elected
to treat that certificate
as a claim for compensation to which s81A of the
Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (“the Act”)
and disputed liability to make ongoing payments of compensation in
relation to the worker’s claim.
5. In doing so, the employer relies
upon s69(13) of the Act. In general terms, s69(13) enables an employer, where
there is a gap in
certification of more than fourteen days, and a worker
delivers another certificate, to dispute liability to pay compensation.
6. The employer says it is entitled to do this, because the way the
continuing workers compensation medical certificates in May 2021
were completed
means that there is a gap in certification of more than fourteen days, and it
may rely on that gap in accordance with
s69(13) of the Act to dispute its
ongoing liability.
7. In support of the s81A referral, which was filed in the
Tribunal on 16 August 2021, the employer relied upon the claim and workers
compensation medical certificates already referred to, together with a copy of a
report from Dr Allen, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon,
dated 30 June
8. Dr Allen, in his report, opined that the worker’s left
shoulder condition is an entirely constitutional and degenerative
condition of
the shoulder, and had not been caused or contributed to in any way by the
worker’s employment. It was also his
view that there had been no work
caused aggravation, exacerbation or the like (within the extended definition of
under the Act) of the underlying condition.
worker concedes that the report of Dr Allen would be sufficient to satisfy the
Tribunal that there is a reasonably arguable
case to dispute the claim if the
Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the referral. However, it is the
worker’s position that
there has been no gap in certification after the
expiration of a specified period of incapacity, and that therefore the employer
cannot rely on s69(13) to the dispute the claim under s81A of the
10. It is the question of whether the employer is able to rely on
s69(13), and hence, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear the
s81A referral,
that needs to be determined. If I am satisfied that s69(13) is available to the
employer to treat the certificate
dated 5 July 2021 as a claim for compensation
to which s81A applies, the worker has conceded a reasonably arguable case
Workers compensation medical certificates under the Act
11. In accordance with s69(1) of the Act, weekly payments of
compensation are payable to a worker where total or partial incapacity
results from an injury suffered by the worker, and where the existence of such
total or partial incapacity is supported
by a certificate in a form approved by
the WorkCover Tasmania Board signed by a medical practitioner.
continuing medical certificate in the approved form, relevantly for the purposes
of this discussion, include Section 4 which
deals with the certifying
practitioner’s medical assessment of the worker; Section 6 which deals
with the worker’s capacity
to work; Section 7 which deals with a
worker’s return to work; and Section 8 which deals with the worker’s
medical management,
and particularly the date upon which the certifying
practitioner wishes to review the worker, if at all.
13. Section 6 of the
continuing medical certificate, dealing with the worker’s capacity to
work, gives the certifying practitioner
a choice of five options:
• The first option is that the worker requires further
treatment but is fit for pre-injury duties. If this option is chosen,
certifying practitioner is directed to proceed to Section 8.
second option is that the worker is fit for suitable duties from a specified
date to another specified date (the dates
to be filled in by the certifying
practitioner). If that option is chosen, the certifying practitioner is
directed to proceed to
• The third option is that the worker
will be incapacitated for any work from a specified date to a specified date
certifying practitioner is required to fill in the dates). The
practitioner is directed that if the period of incapacity is greater
days, the practitioner is to give reasons in the space provided, together with
an appointed review date at Section 8.
• The fourth option is that
the worker will cease to be incapacitated for work on a specified date (to be
filled out). If this
option is chosen, the practitioner is directed to proceed
to Section 9 of the Act (which is the section for the certificate to be
• The final option under Section 6 is that the worker is fit for
ongoing suitable duties from a specified date (to be filled
practitioner). The practitioner is then directed to indicate whether the
suitable duties are permanent (Yes or No) and
then proceed to Section 7.
14. Section 7 of the continuing medical certificate, which
relates to the worker’s return to work, requires the certifying
practitioner
to choose “yes” or “no” options for either
full time or graduated return to work, and then complete a table
in relation to
hours per day, and days per week for the return to work. The certifying
practitioner is then asked to indicate whether
rest breaks are required, and if
so to provide detail. The certifying practitioner is then asked to select
“no” options for areas of reduced capacity
including things such as use of the worker’s arms, lifting, sitting,
standing or operating machinery. If there are areas of reduced capacity
identified, the certifying practitioner is directed to provide
comments on
restrictions. Finally, the certifying practitioner is asked to advise whether
there are any other impediments to return
to work, and if so, to provide
15. Section 8 of the continuing medical certificate deals with
medical management, and requires the certifying practitioner to indicate
the worker has consulted any other health professionals, the nature of
treatment/medication/investigations undertaken, whether
the certifying
practitioner has referred the worker other health professionals and whether any
procedure is likely. The certifying
practitioner is then asked to indicate
whether the practitioner wishes to review the worker and is given the option of
either “yes” or “no”. If option
“yes” is selected, the section provides space for the practitioner
to advise the date of review. If the option of “no” is selected,
the section goes on “medical treatment has ceased
and no further
intervention is required (final consultation)”.

Tasmanian”), the Tribunal was asked to consider whether asserted defects
in the medical certificates relied
on by the worker meant the certificates were
incapable of supporting the worker’s entitlement to weekly payments of
compensation.
In paragraph 8 of his decision, Chief Commissioner Carey
“The crux of this matter is whether the worker has provided a
medical certificate in the approved form and which a medical practitioner
certified that he is incapacitated for work. I do not accept that the term
“certificate in a form approved by the Board”,
requires all aspects
of that form to be completed as invited by the form. Based upon my experience I
recognise the subject certificates
to be in a form approved by the Board. In my
view, the approved form is just that; a template document that is then completed
the addition of information required by the printed content of that form. For
the purposes of s.69(1) the medical certificate is
only required to evidence the
certification of incapacity by the medical practitioner. The certificate is not
required to deal with
causation (State of Tasmania v Parsons
[2002] TASSC
which makes criticism as to the lack of diagnosis or inconsistency as
to the description of cause or uncertainty of cause irrelevant
for the present
purposes. So also does the failure to complete other aspects of the
The worker’s medical certificates
17. In this instance, the content of the continuing workers
compensation medical certificates delivered by the worker to her employer
central to the worker’s argument that the employer ought not be able to
rely upon s69(13) to dispute the claim. It is necessary
for me to set out the
content of those certificates.
18. The continuing workers compensation
medical certificate dated 5 January 2021, which was the first continuing medical
certificate
after the initial workers compensation medical certificate, noted in
Section 4 that the worker’s symptoms at the time of the
assessment were
“left shoulder pain improving”, and provided a current diagnosis of
“bursitis/AC arthropathy”.
Under Section 6, the certifying
practitioner, Dr Shaw, indicated that the worker was fit for suitable duties
from 5 January 2021
to 19 January 2021. Under Section 7, Dr Shaw indicated that
a graduated return to work was required, and restrictions on duties
out. Under Section 8, Dr Shaw relevantly indicated that he wished to review the
worker on 19 January 2021.
19. The next continuing medical certificate was
dated 19 January 2021. The symptoms and diagnosis set out under Section 4 of
certificate were of left shoulder pain and AC arthropathy/bursitis
respectively. Under Section 6 of the certificate, Dr Shaw indicated
worker was fit for suitable duties from 19 January 2021 to 1 February 2021.
Under Section 7 of the certificate, a graduated
with a requirement that the worker be restricted to sedentary duties. Under
Section 8 of the certificate
Dr Shaw relevantly indicated he wished to review
the worker on 1 February 2021.
20. The next continuing medical certificate
was dated 2 February 2021. Symptoms and diagnosis were unchanged from the
previous certificate.
Under Section 6 of the certificate, Dr Shaw indicated the
worker was fit for suitable duties from 1 February 2021 to 10 February
Information under Section 7 of the certificate was unchanged from the previous
certificate, and under Section 8, Dr Shaw indicated
he wished to review the
worker on 10 February 2021.
21. The next certificate was dated 10 February
2021. Current symptoms and diagnosis were the same as in the previous
certificate,
although the worker’s left shoulder pain was said to be
improving. Under Section 6 of the certificate, the worker was fit
for suitable
duties from 10 February 2021 to 22 February 2021. Details for a graduated

the certificate, Dr Shaw indicated he wished to review the worker on 22 February
22. The next continuing medical certificate was dated 22 February
2021. Symptoms and diagnosis set out under Section 4 of the certificate
respectively left shoulder pain and AC arthropathy and bursitis. Under Section
6 of the certificate, the worker was certified
fit for suitable duties from 22
February 2021 to 15 March 2021. Details for a graduated return to work were set
out under Section
7 of the certificate. Under Section 8 of the certificate, Dr
Shaw indicated he wished to review the worker on 15 March 2021.
23. The next
continuing certificate was dated 14 April 2021. The symptoms and diagnosis
under Section 4 of the certificate were unchanged
from the previous certificate.
Under Section 6 of the certificate, the worker was certified to be fit for
suitable duties from 13
April 2021 to 3 May 2021. Details for a graduated

did not select any of the options under Section 6 of the certificate in relation
to capacity for work. That part of the
certificate was left blank. Under
Section 7 of the certificate, details for a graduated return to work were set
out. Dr Shaw indicated
he wished to review the worker on 31 May
25. The next continuing certificate was dated 31 May 2021. The
symptoms under Section 4 of the certificate were unchanged, the diagnosis
only that of AC arthropathy. Once again, Dr Shaw did not select any of the
options under Section 6 in relation to the worker’s
capacity to work, and
that part of the certificate was left blank. Section 7 of the certificate set
out details for a graduated
Dr Shaw indicated he wished to review the worker on 5 July 2021.
26. The next
continuing certificate was dated 5 July 2021. The symptoms and diagnosis under
Section 4 of the certificate were unchanged
from the previous certificate.
Under Section 6 of the certificate, the worker was certified to be fit for
suitable duties from 5
July 2021 to 26 July 2021. Under Section 7 of the
certificate, details for a graduated return to work were set out. Dr Shaw
under Section 8 of the certificate that he wished to review the worker
on 26 July 2021.
27. The final continuing certificate that was before the
Tribunal was dated 26 July 2021. Again, Section 4 indicated the worker was
suffering from left shoulder pain, and the diagnosis was AC Arthropathy. The
worker was certified to be fit for suitable duties from
26 July 2021 until.
Section 7 of the certificate was completed, and Dr Shaw indicated in Section 8
that he wished to review the
worker on 30 August 2021.
What is the law about s69(13)?
28. S69(13) provides as follows:
the period specified in a medical certificate provided by a worker under this
section expires and the worker provides a further
certificate more than 14 days
after the expiration of that specified period, the employer, on receipt of the
subsequent certificate,
may treat that certificate as a claim for compensation
section 81A
29. The “period specified”, under s69(13), refers
to the period of incapacity specified in the medical certificate. (See
State of Tasmania
[2004] TASSC 75
and Walker v J &A Freeman Building
[2006] TASSC 90)
30. Commissioner Chandler considered the meaning
of a ‘specified period’ of incapacity for the purposes of s69(13) in
Department of Education v M.
[2011] TASWRCT 14.
In that case, the worker had
delivered to the employer a workers compensation medical certificate, dated 28
June 2007. Under Section
6 of the certificate (capacity to work) the worker was
certified by Dr Macrossan to be fit for modified duties from the date of the
certificate “to INDEFINITE”.
31. In June 2010 the worker
delivered another workers compensation medical certificate, this one from Dr
Ostberg, certifying the worker
to be incapacitated for work from 28 September
2010 to 28 May 2011. In considering the certificates, Commissioner Chandler
at paragraphs 9 and 10:
It is apparent from reading s69(13) that it can only operate to permit a
certificate to be treated as a claim for compensation
if a preceding certificate
incorporates a “specified period” of incapacity. In United Repairing
Co. Limited v Brother
[1944] NZGazLawRp 108; (1945) NZLR 160, Myers CJ at 164
defined the term “specified period” to mean “that the period
must be fixed, definite and certain.” That definition has been previously
approved of and applied by the Tribunal (see Department
of Education v J
and Myer Stores Ltd v B
[2004] TASWRCT 21)
and I intend doing the
same in this instance. This leads to the question; does Dr Macrossan’s
certificate of 28 June 2007 incorporate
a period which is fixed, definite and
certain? The answer to that question requires consideration of the meaning of
the word “indefinite”
because of the use of that word by Dr
Macrossan to denote the end time of the worker’s partial
incapacity.”
“[10] The Macquarie dictionary gives these meanings to the word
“indefinite”; “not definite; without fixed
or specified limit;
unlimited; an indefinite number.” It is plain, if one adopts the general
tenor of these meanings, which
I do, that Dr Macrossan’s certificate
cannot be said to incorporate a specified period of incapacity which is fixed,
or certain. This is so because use of the word “indefinite”
indicates the very opposite, that is a period which is not
fixed or with a
specified limit.”
32. Commissioner Chandler went on to determine that the
certificate that had been issued by Dr Macrossan prior to the certificate
28 June 2010, and which certified the worker to be incapacitated for a period
beginning on 6 June and ending on 30 June 2007,
was for the purposes of s69(13),
a certificate containing a specified period of incapacity that expired on 30
June 2007. On that
basis, the employer was able to treat Dr Ostberg’s
certificate from 2010 as a claim for compensation to which s81A applied,
dispute the claim.
33. The decision of Commissioner Chandler was the subject
of consideration on appeal to the Supreme Court, and the appeal was dismissed
Crawford J (as he then was) in McKenzie v State of Tasmania
[2011] TASSC 42.
34. In Christian Schools Tasmania v D
[2017] TASWRCT 37
, Chief Commissioner
Webster was required to determine whether s69(13) was available for the employer
to rely on, in order to treat
a medical certificate as a claim for compensation
that could be disputed in accordance with s81A.
35. The worker in that case
had delivered an initial certificate dated 7 June 2017 in support of her claim
for compensation. In Section
6 of the certificate, her GP had chosen the option
that the worker required treatment but was fit for pre-injury duties. He
the worker two days later, and provided a continuing certificate Dated
9 June 2017. In Section 6, the worker’s GP selected
two options He ticked
the first option, that the worker required further treatment, but was fit for
pre-injury duties. He also ticked
the fourth option that the worker would cease
to be incapacitated on a specific date, but put a cross through the tick, and
fill in a date. At Section 9, above his and the worker’s
signatures, the GP wrote the notation “Fit to return to normal
Tue 13/6/17”.
36. The next certificate delivered by the worker was
dated 31 July 2017, and certified the worker to be fit for suitable duties
31 July 2017 and 28 August 2017.
37. Chief Commissioner Webster
followed previous decisions of the Tribunal that defined “specified
period” to mean that
the period must be “fixed, definite and
certain”, and that the “specified period” must be a period of
for work, whether partial or whole. He determined that in relation to
the certificates dated 7 June 2017 and 9 June 2017, that there
fixed, definite and certain period of incapacity certified at all” on
either certificate. He dismissed the s81A
referral, on the basis that the
Tribunal was without jurisdiction.
The employer’s position
38. On behalf of the employer, it was submitted that the
failure, or omission, of the certifying practitioner to complete Section
the medical certificates dated 3 May 2021 and 31 May 2021 means that there is no
period of incapacity specified in either of
those certificates.
employer’s counsel referred to the immediately preceding certificate dated
14 April 2021, where Dr Shaw indicated the
worker was fit for suitable duties
from 13 April 2021 to 3 May 2021. It was submitted that it was the last
specified period of incapacity
prior to the delivery of the certificate dated 5
July 2021, at which point Section 6 had again been completed by Dr Shaw, to the
effect that the worker was fit for suitable duties for a specified
40. Because the time between the expiry of the period of partial
incapacity specified in the certificated dated 14 April 2021, and
commencement of the period of partial incapacity specified in the certificate
dated 5 July 2021 is more than 14 days, the employer
submits it can rely upon
s69(13) of the Act to treat that later delivered certificate as a claim for
compensation to which s81A applies,
and dispute the claim.
41. In relation to
the certifying practitioner’s failure to complete Section 6 at all for the
two certificates in May 2021,
the employer submits that it is inappropriate to
speculate as to why that section in each of the certificates has not been
or completed.
The worker’s position
42. The worker’s position is that the two certificates
from May 2021 ought not to be looked at in isolation, but it is appropriate,
this case, to look at the entirety of the medical certification when considering
whether there is, or is not, a period of incapacity
specified in the
certificates in question.
43. Counsel for the worker referred to the
certificates over the period from January to April 2021, and noted that in each
Dr Shaw completes Section 6 of the certificate by specifying a period
of partial incapacity, identifies in Section 7 the restrictions
he places on the
worker’s duties, and in Section 8 indicates the date that he wishes to
review the worker. In each certificate,
the date of review is the same as the
end date for the specified period of incapacity.
44. Dr Shaw did the same
thing in the certificate dated 5 July – that is, he specified a period of
partial incapacity, noted
restrictions on the worker’s duties, and
indicated that he wished to review the worker on the last day of the specified
of incapacity.
45. In relation to the two certificates completed by Dr
Shaw in May 2021, counsel for the worker submitted that, because of the way
Shaw has completed Section 7 setting out restrictions on the worker’s
duties, the certificates establish that the worker
had a reduced earning
46. Referring to the Tribunal’s decision in Purely
Tasmanian, counsel for the worker submitted the former Chief Commissioner’
decision (as set out above) recognises that general practitioners, who are
untrained in legal intricacies, ought not to be held to
particularly high
standards in relation to completion of workers compensation medical
certificates
47. Having regard to the pattern set out in the earlier and
later certificates, it was submitted that I ought to take a common-sense
approach, and determine that, in each certificate, there is a specified period
of incapacity that commences on the date of the certificate,
and ends on the
date for the next review by Dr Shaw.
48. The effect of the submission for the
worker is that there is no gap in excess of fourteen days between any periods of
set out in the certificates between April 2021 and July 2021 which
would enable the employer to rely on s69(13) of the Act to treat
the certificate
dated 5 July 2021 as a claim for compensation to which s81A applies.
Is there a “period specified” in the certificates
in question?
49. Dr Shaw completed Section 6 in the certificates that he
provided to the worker prior to the certificates he provided in May 2021,
each of them specified a period of incapacity. For some reason, he did not
complete Section 6 in the two certificates dated
3 May 2021 and 31 May 2021.
50. There is no doubt that the certificates dated 3 May 2021 and 31 May 2021
certify that the worker is, at least partially incapacitated
51. The effect of the certificates in May 2021 is similar to the effect
of the certificate of Dr Macrossan that was before the Tribunal
in Department of
Education v M (supra) – that is, the existence of a partial incapacity for
work was supported by the certificate,
but there was a question about whether a
specified period was certified for that partial incapacity.
52. Irrespective
of whether Dr Shaw’s failure to twice address Section 6 in the
certificates was deliberate, or whether he simply
overlooked doing so, the
effect is that no “fixed, definite or certain period” of incapacity
was specified on the face
of those certificates. The question is whether I ought
to infer a specified period, being a ‘fixed, definite and certain’
period of partial incapacity from the terms of those certificates, when viewed
in the context of the overall certification in relation
to the worker.
have reached the view that I ought not do so.
54. In Purely Tasmanian, Chief
Commissioner Carey found that the medical certificate in question, for the
purposes of s69(1) was “only
required to evidence the certification of
incapacity by the medical practitioner”. The failure of the GP to complete
sections of the certificate was irrelevant to that issue.
55. For the
purposes of s69(13), the question must be whether medical certificates evidence
a period of incapacity that is fixed,
definite and certain.
56. I do not
think that a certificate can be considered to evidence a ‘fixed, definite
and certain’ period of incapacity
where there is no certification at all
inferred, rather
than appearing on the face of the certificate.
that the certificates dated 3 May 2021 and 31 May 2021 do not specify a period
of incapacity.
58. In the absence of a specified period of incapacity in
those certificates, the employer may rely upon s69(13), and treat the
certificate
dated 5 July 2021 as a claim for compensation to which s81A
59. Counsel for the worker has conceded that, if I find the Tribunal
has jurisdiction to hear the s81A referral, the employer has
demonstrated it has
a reasonably arguable case to dispute its ongoing liability to pay compensation
in relation to the worker’s
claim. Having had regard to Dr Allen’s
report, I find that is so.
60. There will be orders in accordance with
s81A(3)(c) and (d) of the Act.
