1.43 The bill seeks to repeal and replace section 544A of the
Biosecurity
(Biosecurity Act) to expand the scope of the functions or powers of
the Director of Human Biosecurity that may be delegated
1.44 Section 544A of the Biosecurity Act currently authorises the Director to
delegate in writing any or all of their functions or
powers under Part 3 of
Chapter 2, which relate to human biosecurity control orders, to an Senior
Executive Service (SES) employee
or an acting SES employee in the Health
Department who is a human biosecurity officer. Schedule 1, item 9, proposed
section 544A
of the bill would significantly expand the scope of the
Director’s functions and powers that may be delegated to include all
three of their functions or powers under the Biosecurity Act. Proposed
subsection 544A(3) proposes to carve out the Director’s
determine human health response zones; issue identity cards to human biosecurity
officers; and make declarations modifying
the operation of the Biosecurity Act
with respect to the actual or intended movements of specified people, goods or
conveyances.
1.45 The committee has consistently drawn attention to legislation that
allows the delegation of administrative powers to a relatively
large class of
persons, with little or no specificity as to their qualifications or attributes.
Generally, the committee prefers
to see a limit set either on the scope of
powers that might be delegated, or on the categories of people to whom those
powers might
be delegated. The committee's preference is that delegates be
confined to the holders of nominated offices or to members of the SES.
broad delegations are provided for, the committee considers that an explanation
as to why these are considered necessary should
be included in the explanatory
memorandum.
1.46 In this instance, the delegation power would be limited to SES or acting
SES employees in the Health Department who are authorised
human biosecurity
officers with appropriate clinical
Notwithstanding this,
the explanatory memorandum provides limited information about why it is
necessary and appropriate to significantly
broaden the Director’s power to
delegate to all functions under the Biosecurity Act, subject only to three
discrete exceptions.
This item, by replacing the DHB’s existing ability to delegate certain
powers, would allow the DHB to delegate all their functions
and powers under the
Biosecurity Act to SES employees in the Department, other than those covered by
specific exceptions. This will
their normal role alongside their role of the DHB, and that operational
can be efficiently made (if required) by relevant operational teams
and technical emergency management or medical
1.47 The committee has generally not accepted a desire for administrative
flexibility as a sufficient justification for allowing a
broad delegation of
administrative powers to officials at any level. In this regard, additional
detail concerning the necessity and
appropriateness of empowering the Director
to delegate the majority of their functions or powers under the Biosecurity Act
have assisted the committee’s examination of the bill.
1.48 The committee draws its scrutiny concerns to the attention of
senators and leaves to the Senate as a whole the appropriateness
of providing in
Schedule 1, item 9, proposed section 544A for the Director of Human
Biosecurity to delegate any or all of their
functions, duties or powers under
the Biosecurity Act.
