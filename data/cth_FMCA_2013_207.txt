REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
Application
applicant, Melinda Devonshire
Devonshire”), has made an application (“Application”) in the
Court’s Fair Work Division alleging
a termination by the first respondent,
Magellan Powertronics Pty Ltd (“Magellan Powertronics”), of her
employment in
contravention of
Fair Work Act 2009
”). Together with the Application Ms
Devonshire filed a “Form 2 – Claim under the
Fair Work Act
alleging dismissal in contravention of a general protection”
(“Claim Form”).
respondents filed an application is a case on 27 April 2012, and subsequently,
rather than having the application is a case determined,
sought to have the
Court make a decision on three questions relating to whether or not the
applicant has a workplace right or rights,
whether the Court has jurisdiction,
and whether the second and third respondents should be removed as parties. Those
questions are
set out in more detail below: see para.44 below.
a Substituted Response filed on 24 May 2012 the respondents, including the
second and third respondents, Masoud Abshar and Jolleh
the making of any orders with respect to the application and say that the
application ought to be dismissed; and
forth the following grounds of opposition:
workplace right or rights identified by Ms Devonshire are not a workplace right
Devonshire had no ability to make a complaint or inquiry;
Devonshire had not made a complaint;
Devonshire had not made an inquiry and could not do so;
alleged entitlements that Ms Devonshire seeks under her contract of employment
are not workplace rights;
that Ms Devonshire had a workplace right, had exercised a workplace right or had
proposed to exercise a workplace right;
alternatively,
if Ms Devonshire had made one or more complaints or inquiries and if, by so
doing, or otherwise, she had a workplace
right or workplace rights or had
exercised a workplace right or rights or had proposed to exercise a workplace
right or rights, Ms
Devonshire’s employment was not terminated for any of
those reasons;
Devonshire’s employment was terminated for reasons including the reasons
given by Magellan Powertronics and Jolleh Abshar
on 27 January 2012;
taking adverse action against the applicant contrary to s.340 of the
there is no jurisdiction, pursuant to s.371 of the
, to hear the
dispute relating to s.352 of the
because that dispute was not part
of the application to Fair Work Australia (“FWA”), and FWA has not
issued a certificate
under s.369 of the
in relation to that
the time of termination Ms Devonshire was not temporarily absent from work
because of illness or injury of a kind prescribed by
Regulations 2009
FW Regulations
that Magellan Powertronics terminated Ms Devonshire’s employment contrary
to s.352 of the
not admit that Ms Devonshire has suffered or could have, or would have, suffered
the loss stated in her “Details of Compensation
Sought”; and
Devonshire’s employment was subject to a period of three months probation.
The duration of employment at the time of Ms Devonshire’s
employment being
terminated was less than three months. Even if Ms Devonshire’s employment
had not been terminated on 27 January
2012 it would have come to an end by
agreement on 21 February 2012 or, alternatively, could have been lawfully
terminated on 21 February
a Reply also filed on 24 May 2012 Ms Devonshire asserts that:
action was taken against her because she had a workplace right, and the claim is
grounded in s.340 of the
terminating her employment Magellan Powertronics took adverse action against her
within the meaning of s.342 of the
had a workplace right under s.341 of the
to be paid her
entitlements under her contract of employment;
Powertronics contravened s.352 of the
by dismissing her from
employment when she was temporarily absent from work because of illness or
injury of a kind prescribed by
FW Regulations
had a workplace right to make an inquiry or complaint relating to the
underpayment of her entitlements, which she made clear to
Magellan Powertronics
she would enforce as of right;
had a right to inquire when her entitlements would be paid and a right to sick
query with respect to correct entitlements was one of the reasons why she was
terminated, particularly when viewed against the
background that:
had been no complaint about her employment;
was offered a new position with Magellan Powertronics two days prior to the
termination of her employment; and
to termination of her employment, there was no indication that Magellan
Powertronics was unhappy with her sales performance,
or any discussion
concerning her performance in any capacity whatsoever.
of the Reply is more submission than Reply proper, and has been considered by
the Court as being both a Reply, and where appropriate,
submission.

The evidence of Ms Devonshire
The FWA Application
the FWA Application Ms Devonshire alleges a contravention of s.340 of the
on the basis that she was a person who “
has a workplace
, s.340(1)(a)(i), and describes the events in
relation to the alleged contravention as follows:
was agreed that she be employed as Business Development Manager at Magellan
Powertronics on a salary package of:
annual base salary;
car allowance per year;
mobile phone allowance of $140 per month; and
commission on all goods sold through her employment;
Devonshire requested a written contract on a number of occasions, including
prior to commencing work, in the first week of work,
and in the second week
during an induction with Jolleh Abshar;
1 December 2011 Ms Devonshire sent an email to Mark Williams, who was Magellan
Powertronics’ National Sales Manager, indicating
that she had been paid
incorrectly, and followed this up with an email on 15 December 2011 indicating
that she was still not being
paid correctly. The error was that her salary was
noted on her payslip as $65,000 per annum, but was in “the system”
as $67,000 per annum;
Devonshire says that she sent at least four more emails before going on annual
leave on Christmas Day concerning payment of:
salary; and
allowance, which she indicated needed to be paid because she was out of pocket,
and she needed to be reimbursed so as to cover
she returned to work on 16 January 2012 she had still not received her correct
salary, car allowance or mobile phone allowance,
and sent emails asking for this
to be rectified, and says that she was told that the matter would be
Devonshire says that she sent an email to payroll on 27 January 2012 and
that this email was sent to Jolleh Abshar, who told Ms
Devonshire that Masoud
Abshar wanted to see her regarding pay;
Devonshire went to see Masoud Abshar who said she was not worth the money, and
that if she did not wear the company polo tee-shirt
he would sack her, so she
agreed to wear that if that was his request, and that he then stated that he was
not happy to pay her the
correct salary;
Devonshire says that Masoud Abshar said that he was not happy with the fact that
Ms Devonshire had gone on holiday over the Christmas
break, although she says
that he knew this was her plan before she started in the position, and confirmed
it in writing before she
took the position with the company. Masoud Abshar said
he was not happy with this, saying that he worked on Saturdays and Sundays
that the salary that she was on was a very similar salary to his and that she
should be working 80 plus hours a week like him;
was terminated on 27 January 2012 after she left work for home feeling unwell,
and that she went to the doctor and has a doctor’s
certificate for that
Devonshire then asserts, and it is reflected in an email sent to Mark Williams,
shortly after she was terminated, that:
reason I was dismissed is because Masoud and Jolleh Abshar didn’t want to
pay me my correct and outstanding Salary.
I was terminated because I asked to be
paid correctly.
is then set out a series of emails concerning her termination and salary package
including the following email sent to Jolleh
Abshar on 28 January 2012, which
includes the following extract:
yesterday as I was not feeling very well, I spoke to George and asked him who
the correct person to see regarding me going
and I did attempt to see Masoud however I could not find him or yourself. I sent
you an email informing
you of this and you did respond, hoping that I would feel
better soon. I have evidence that I went to the doctors and I have a
certificate.
above matters are set out at Part 2.2 of the FWA
Application.
The Claim Form

Application in a case and decision on questions
The application in a case and questions
27 April 2012 the respondents filed an application in a case (“Application
in a Case”) seeking the following orders:
the second and third respondents be removed as parties; and
the application, so far as it relates to ss.340 and 352 of the
application in a case was supported by affidavits filed by Masoud Abshar of 23
April 2012 and 23 May 2012, and an affidavit of
Jolleh Abshar of 23 April

questions) separately from another question in the

this Court ought to adopt the
approach of the Federal Court in relation to O.29 r.2 of the former
Court Rules
when considering applications under r.17.02 of the

Federal Magistrates Act,

principles governing whether an order for determination of a separate question
ought to be made have been conveniently and succinctly

Court’s judgment in
Reading Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Mutual
Provident Society & Anor
(1999) 217 ALR 495
[1999] FCA 718
Reading Australia
”) as follows:
the term "question" in O 29 r 1 includes any question or issue of fact or law in
a proceeding. The distinction in the
rule between an "issue" and a "question" is
the distinction between that which, when resolved, will result in an
adjudication in
favour of one party or the other, being an "issue", and less
decisive matters of dispute being "questions" (Landsal Pty Ltd (in liq)
Building Society
[1993] FCA 121
(1993) 41 FCR 421
[1993] FCA 121
113 ALR 643
question can be the subject of an order for a separate decision under O 29 r 2
even though a decision on such a question will
not determine any of the parties'
rights (Landsal Pty Ltd (in liq) v REI Building Society at FCR
425; ALR 647)
however, the judicial determination of a question under O 29 r 2 must involve a
conclusive or final decision based on concrete
and established or agreed facts
for the purpose of quelling a controversy between the parties (Bass v Permanent
Trustee Co Ltd
(1999) 198 CLR 334
161 ALR 399
[1999] HCA 9
the preliminary question is one of mixed fact and law, it is necessary that the
question can be precisely formulated and
that all of the facts that are on any
fairly arguable view relevant to the determination of the question are
ascertainable either
as facts assumed to be correct for the purposes of the
preliminary determination, or as agreed facts or as facts to be judicially
determined (Jacobson v Ross
[1995] VicRp 24
[1995] 1 VR 337
at 341, referring to Nissan v
Attorney-General;
[1969] UKHL 3
[1970] AC 179
[1969] 1 All ER 629
at 663-4 per Lord
Pearson; Bass v Perpetual Trustee at [53]);
must be taken in utilising the procedure provided for in O 29 r 1 to avoid the
determination of issues not "ripe" for separate
and preliminary determination.
An issue may not be "ripe" for separate and preliminary determination in this
sense where it is simply
one of two or more alternative ways in which an
applicant frames its case and determination of the issue would leave significant
other issues unresolved (CBS Productions Pty Ltd v O'Neill
(1985) 1 NSWLR 601
per Kirby P at 606);
(f) factors
which tend to support the making of an order under O 29 r 2 include that the
separate determination of the question may:

together the objects of the FM Act in s.3, the mode of operation in s.42, and
having regard to the objects of the FMC Rules

Court is intended to operate in a manner:
informal as possible in the exercise of judicial power;
is not protracted in its proceedings;
resolves proceedings justly, efficiently and economically;
streamlined procedures; and
undue delay, expense and technicality.
Application of the principles to this case
Nature of the hearing and of the question sought to be determined
separate questions sought to be asked and determined by the respondents are a
major and substantial issues in the litigation.
questions sought to be determined are in the nature of a conventional
preliminary issue, as to the existence of a right, jurisdiction
and proper or
necessary parties. Ordinarily (but not always), such questions are heard on the
statements of fact;
narrow point to be determined; and
hearing able to be conducted within a short time (or a short time relative to
the total length if the hearing of the separate question
were not to be dealt
questions in this case are conventional separate questions, albeit that there is
no agreement on the facts between the parties.
There are, however, concrete
facts upon which the Court can base its judgment in relation to the three
separate questions, which
facts are not in dispute for the relevant purposes of
the three separate questions. There is a very limited range of relevant facts,
which taken together with the relevant legislative provisions, enables the Court
to readily answer the separate questions posed.
Court must consider the length of a hearing if the separate questions are not to
be determined, and measure that against the time
which will elapse if the
separate questions are heard and determined adversely:

that they seek with respect to the separate questions
posed there would be no
hearing of the merits of the Application at all. Even if the respondents do not
succeed in obtaining the
answers that they seek, the issues for hearing will
however have been clarified, and the clarification, in terms of the required
length of hearing time, would have taken no longer than the additional hearing
time necessary to argue the matter at any final merits
Evidence – Witnesses and Experts
separate hearing of the three separate questions posed by the respondents did
not require the calling of witnesses or experts,
or more particularly, the
prospect that they might be recalled and their evidence re-canvassed at any
subsequent hearing. Because
the relevant facts for the purposes of determining
the existence of a right, jurisdiction and the proper or necessary parties, were
within a limited compass, the Court did not need to go beyond the affidavits
already filed in the matter, and then only for limited
purposes as outlined
above. The parties did not seek to call or cross-examine witnesses for the
purposes of the separate hearing.
Provisions of the FM Act and FMC Rules
objects and provisions of the
are met because
resolution of the separate questions will either:
to the final determination by way of an order of dismissal if the respondents
obtain the answers that they seek to the questions;
the respondents do not receive the answers that they seek in relation to the
three separate questions, the issues for argument
and determination at any final
hearing will nevertheless be narrowed, and the prospects of a settlement ought
to be increased by
resolution of such fundamental preliminary

Reading Australia
ALR at 500 per
Branson J; FCA at para.14 per Branson J. As indicated above, the determination
of the separate questions in this matter
may lead either to the dismissal of the
proceedings, or, at least, a significant narrowing of the issues to be
determined at hearing.
The latter might facilitate a settlement of the
Court considers that, even if the separate questions are answered adversely to
the respondents, that the answers will be such
that the prospects of settlement
arising from the hearing of the separate questions are sufficient to warrant the
separate questions
being heard.
Length of litigation
length of the litigation, at least insofar as hearing of the matter is
concerned, will not be protracted by reason of the determination
of the separate
questions, and the overall length of the litigation may be foreshortened if the
answers result in either dismissal
of the proceedings or otherwise increase the
prospect of settlement of the proceedings.
regard to the principles, the Court determined that it was just, convenient and
appropriate in all the circumstances to hear
the three separate questions. The
Court therefore made an order on 19 June 2012 that the Court decide three
questions, namely:

contravention of s.352 of the
the second and third respondents should be removed as

need for an agreed statement of facts, and the Court proceeded to hear the
on that day. Following the delivery of the Federal Court judgment in
Shea v TruEnergy Services Pty Ltd (No. 1)

”) a Full Bench of FWA said as
is whether the criterion in s 341(1)(c)(ii) is met whenever an employee
makes a complaint to a responsible senior manager

employment relationship. We are inclined to think that is it not and that
s 341(1)(c)(ii) contemplates
that the employee is "able" to make the
complaint by virtue of some provision in a statute or in an instrument such as a
agreement or contract of employment. However, the appellant made no
submissions on s 341(1)(c)(ii) and the respondent was not given
an adequate
opportunity to be heard in relation to this question. We do not think it

concluded view upon the issue.
Moreover, the matter was not argued before the
Full Bench of FWA in

they did not ultimately consider or rule upon the matter) rule out the
possibility that
s.341(1)(c)(ii) of the

Explanatory Memorandum
addition to the paragraph cited by this Court in
and set out
above: see para.56 above, the Explanatory Memorandum to the

(Cth) (“Explanatory Memorandum”) contains a number of
[i]llustrative examples
” including the
works part-time at a petrol station. He believes he is not being paid the
correct award rate for a console operator. He
writes a letter of complaint
to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) as he mistakenly
believes that it is able
to investigate wage underpayments. Freddy tells
his manager about the letter. Following this, his hours for the next
are cut in half. While the complaint would not be covered by
paragraph 341(1)(c)(i) as the ACCC does not have capacity under a workplace
to seek compliance with the applicable award, Freddy would still have exercised
a workplace right because he has made a complaint
regarding his employment
(subparagraph 341(1)(c)(ii)).
above example demonstrates that the Parliament’s intention was that a
complaint can be made to a body without capacity to
seek compliance, and that
that complaint can be mentioned to the employer, which then constitutes the
exercise of a workplace right
because of the making of a complaint regarding
employment under s.341(1)(c)(ii) of the
. That confirms that the
ordinary meaning of “
” for the purposes of
s.341(1)(c) of the
includes the making of a complaint directly by
an employee to an employer in relation to their employment. In that regard, the
of the Explanatory Memorandum are extrinsic materials which confirm
the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of s.341(1)(c) of the
Acts Interpretation Act 1901
Conclusion – “is able to”
consideration of s.341(1)(c) of the

parliamentary, points to the ordinary meaning of the phrase “

, that being that an employee can make a complaint or inquiry
direct to their employer and such a complaint or inquiry can constitute
workplace right for the purposes of s.341(1)(c)(ii) of the
Conclusion – workplace right
the reasons set out above, Ms Devonshire has a workplace right with respect to
alleged adverse action in relation to her entitlement
to, and her complaints or
inquiries about, her salary package and payments. The answer to question (a) is
therefore “yes”.
Question (b) – whether jurisdiction to hear s.352 claim

An employer
must not dismiss an employee
because the employee
is temporarily absent from work because of illness or injury of a kind
prescribed by the regulations.

declaration about the illness or injury, within:

(a) is required by the terms of a workplace instrument:
(i) to notify the employer of an absence from work; and
(ii) to substantiate the reason for the absence; and
(b) complies with those terms.
(4) A prescribed kind of illness or injury exists if the employee

with paragraph
107 (3) (a) of the Act, for taking paid personal/carer's leave for a
personal illness or personal injury, as mentioned

respondents submitted that there was a want of jurisdiction in this matter

by Ms Devonshire she
was a former employee rather than an employee of Magellan Powertronics, and that
the medical certificate provided
for in reg.3.01 of the
FW Regulations
required that it be submitted by an employee and not a former employee. The
nonsense of this submission is apparent when other provisions
are examined. If the respondents’ submission was correct it would
mean that “

include a dismissed employee, and s.772 (unlawful termination) would not include
employees. Section 352 of the

some circumstances, and for the Court to make a determination as to whether that
is reasonable
or not. The intention of beneficial legislation such as the
is to provide an opportunity for an employee dismissed to obtain a
remedy in respect of that dismissal, and not for extreme interpretations

to preclude former employees from obtaining a remedy. In
this respect, the respondents’ argument fails.

employer must prove either that it did not know
the reason for the absence or
that it did not terminate the employment by reason of the absence:

essential facts in relation to this issue are that:
Devonshire was employed by Magellan Powertronics;
January 2012 she indicated to a general manager at Magellan Powertronics that
she was unwell and was going to see a doctor;
advised both Masoud Abshar and Jolleh Abshar accordingly by
advice that she was going home ill was acknowledged by Jolleh Abshar with a
request to provide a doctor’s certificate;
letter of termination (Claim Form, document N set out above at para.18)
specifically alludes to the fact that Ms Devonshire left
the office on 27
January 2012; and
doctor’s certificate was subsequently provided, but not until
24 February 2012, some four weeks after Ms Devonshire’s
was terminated.
doctor’s certificate was not provided on 27 or 28 January 2012. It is
clear that in terms of reg.3.01(2)(a) of the
FW Regulations
that the 24
hour time limit running from commencement of the absence cannot be met. The
question arises, however, as to whether a
longer period, namely until the
medical certificate was finally forwarded on 24 February 2012, “
reasonable in the circumstances
”, those circumstances including the
termination of Ms Devonshire’s employment.
the above circumstances, the Court clearly has jurisdiction to determine the
claim made by Ms Devonshire. There is clearly an argument
that she was
temporarily absent from work because of illness or injury of a kind prescribed
by reg.3.01 of the
FW Regulations
, and an argument to be mounted that
there was a prescribed kind of illness for which a medical certificate was
provided. The issue,
which is an issue of discretion in the exercise of a power
within jurisdiction, is whether or not it is reasonable in the circumstances
a longer period than that prescribed by reg.3.01(2)(a) of the
FW Regulations
ought to be allowed for the provision of a medical certificate, in these
circumstances, a period of four weeks: reg.3.01(2)(b) of
Regulations
circumstances where the question is narrowly framed as a question as to the
existence of jurisdiction (and not any question as
to the exercise of power or
discretion within jurisdiction) it is obvious that the above circumstances lead
to the answer to question
Question (c) – removal of parties
respondents ask whether Masoud Abshar and Jolleh Abshar should be removed as
parties to this application.
Court has power to remove a party as a party to an application under r.11.04 of

(1) A party to a proceeding
may apply to the Court to be removed as a party.
(2) The party must file an affidavit stating:
(a) the relationship (if any) of the applicant
to each other party; and
(b) the evidence in support of the application.
(3) The party must serve a copy of the application and affidavit on
each other party in the proceeding.

provides as follows:
(1) A person who is involved
in a contravention of a civil
remedy provision is taken to have contravened that provision.
(2) A person is involved
a contravention of a civil
remedy provision if, and only if, the person:
(a) has aided, abetted, counselled or procured the contravention; or
(b) has induced the contravention, whether by threats or promises or
otherwise; or
(c) has been in any way, by act or omission, directly or indirectly,
knowingly concerned in or party to the
contravention; or
(d) has conspired with others to effect the
contravention.

Masoud Abshar and Jolleh Abshar admit to being involved in communications with
Ms Devonshire about her employment, including
communications with her about the
terms and conditions of her employment, and the payment of salary and
allowances: Affidavit of
Masoud Abshar, 23 May 2012, paragraph 5; Affidavit of
Jolleh Abshar, 23 April 2012, paragraph 6. Jolleh Abshar was involved in the
termination of Ms Devonshire’s employment as it was he who sent the email
to her terminating her employment: see para.18 above.

civil remedy provisions. Sections 340 and 352 of the

shall be treated in the same way as an
actual contravention.
relevant principle in federal civil litigation in relation to legislative
provisions such as s.550 of the
is derived from the High
Court’s judgment in
Yorke & Anor v Lucas
[1985] HCA 65
(1985) 158 CLR 661
”), and the numerous cases which have followed that
judgment, which indicate that to be liable a putative accessory must
intentionally
participate in a contravention, and that to form the requisite
intent the putative accessory must have knowledge of the essential
matters going
to make up the contravention, whether or not the putative accessory knows that
those matters amount to a contravention.
Necessary intent will be absent if the
putative accessory does not know or believe that the assistance or encouragement
something which goes to make up the facts which constitute the
contravention. The principle as it applies in federal civil litigation
origins in the criminal law:
at 676 per Brennan J;
Giorgianni v
[1985] HCA 29
(1985) 156 CLR 473
at 506 per Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ, and one
of its early federal legislative manifestations is in s.75B of the
Practices Act 1974
(Cth). The principles concerning accessorial liability
under federal workplace relations legislation are further expounded in
Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Clarke
[2007] FCAFC 87
(2007) 164 IR
at 308 per Tamberlin, Gyles and Gilmour JJ;
[2007] FCAFC 87
at para.26 per
Tamberlin, Gyles and Gilmour JJ, where the Full Court of the Federal Court
observed that:
of the precise words of the accessorial provision, such liability depends upon
the accessory associating himself or herself
with the contravening conduct
– the accessory should be linked in purpose with the perpetrators (per
Gibbs CJ in
Giorgianni v The Queen
[1985] HCA 29
(1985) 156 CLR 473
at 479-480; see
also Mason J at 493 and Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ at 500). The words
“party to, or concerned in” reflect
that concept. The accessory must
be implicated or involved in the contravention (
Ashburyy v Reid
R v Tannous
(1987) 10 NSWLR 303
per Lee J at 307E- 308D
(agreed with by Street CJ at 304 and Finlay J at 310)) or, as put by Kenny J in
Emwest Products Pty Ltd v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing
and Kindred Industries Union

participate in, or assent to, the contravention.
Accessorial
liability provisions such as those in workplace relations legislation are
commonplace in Commonwealth legislation: see,
for example,
Competition and
Consumer Act 2010
(person involved in a contravention of the
competition rule, etc.);
Paid Parental Leave Act 2010
(involvement in contravention treated in same way as actual contravention);
Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006
(involvement in contraventions);
Corporations Act 2001
(involvement in contraventions), to name but a few that are in identical,
or practically identical, terms to s.550 of the
in relation to accessorial liability are designed to ensure that persons
involved in contravening conduct, often directors
or very senior employees of
corporations, are held liable for their conduct insofar as it resulted in a
contravention of the relevant
legislation. Further, they also ensure that
liability is able to be imposed on persons involved in the contravening conduct
in circumstances
where a company has, for example, become insolvent or been
deregistered, and no penalty would otherwise be recoverable.
a provision which provides for accessorial liability for breach of civil remedy
provisions action may be taken against accessories
without taking action against
the principal:
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Black on
White Pty Ltd & Ors
[2001] FCA 187
(2001) 110 FCR 1
at 14 per Spender J;
[2001] FCA 187
at para.51 per Spender J. An action may continue against an accessory when
discontinued against a principal:
Torpia v Empire Printing (Australia) Pty
[2009] FMCA 853
at 319 per Barnes FM;
[2009] FMCA 853
at para.65 per Barnes
FM. An accessory may also be liable where a company has been deregistered:
Fair Work Ombudsman v Proplas Industries Pty Ltd & Anor
Fair Work Ombudsman v Blacklight Investments Pty Ltd & Anor
at paras.21-26 per Lucev FM. The position is different in respect of
this Court’s small claims proceedings where, because they
do not concern
pecuniary penalty orders and are not civil penalty proceedings, orders can only
be made against an employer:
Beer v Limb & Anor
[2012] FMCA 494
paras.24-25 per O’Sullivan FM. This matter is not a small claims
the above background it is extraordinary that a submission could be made, as it
has been made on behalf of the second and
third respondents, that that they are
not liable because they are not a “
” for the purposes
of s.340 of the
, and not the “
purposes of s.352 of the
. That submission misses the point, and
completely ignores the terms of s.550 of the
, which seek to impose
liability on a person found to be an accessory separate to the
” who is alleged to
have actually contravened the relevant legislative provisions, here ss.340 and
. The respondents’ submission is without any merit
whatsoever.
follows from the above that the respondents’ question (c) should be
answered “no”.
Conclusions and orders
Court has concluded that the answers to the questions raised are as
follows that there also ought to be an order that the application in a case
filed by the respondents on 27 April 2012 be dismissed.
Court will hear the parties as to further directions.
