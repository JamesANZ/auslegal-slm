September 2023, Dr Chen filed an affidavit in his appeal. That affidavit was
not before Industrial Commissioner Pidgeon
on either the hearing of the interim
reinstatement application or on Gold Coast Health’s application for costs
of that application.
Gold Coast Health objects to the reception of Dr
Chen’s affidavit in the appeal.
[12] Gold Coast
Health accepts that Industrial Commissioner Pidgeon erred in exercising the
discretion to award costs. However, the
appeal is resisted on the bases
(a) the error was not material; and
(b) upon a re-exercise of the discretion by this Court, the result would be the
same as that ordered by the Industrial Commissioner.
October 2023, the appeal against the costs order came before me for mention.
Orders were made for the exchange of written
submissions on the question of Gold
Coast Health’s objection to the receipt of the affidavit as further
evidence in the appeal.
An order was also made that the question would be
determined on the written submissions without oral hearing.
[14] Written
submissions were received in due course from both parties.
two decisions of Industrial Commissioner Pidgeon
[15] In order to
evaluate the further evidence, it is necessary to consider some aspects of the
reasons of the Industrial Commissioner
in refusing to order interim
reinstatement and awarding costs to Gold Coast Health.
determining the interim reinstatement application, Industrial Commissioner
Pidgeon directed herself to the statutory grant
of jurisdiction to order interim
reinstatement.
The Industrial
Commissioner recorded that the two claims were consolidated on 22 June
and then identified the
test for the granting of interlocutory relief as the one explained in
Australian Broadcasting Corporation v
[17] Having
identified the two relevant issues as the establishment of a
prima facie
case and the assessment of the balance of convenience, the Industrial
Commissioner proceeded to consider each of those issues.
[18] After a
detailed analysis of the respective submissions and materials, the Industrial
Commissioner was satisfied that Dr Chen
had established a
prima facie
The Industrial
Commissioner then set about a consideration of the balance of
convenience.
Industrial Commissioner held that the balance of convenience favoured dismissal
of Dr Chen’s application. She reasoned
as follows:
(a) while accepting Dr Chen’s submission that his colleagues might welcome
his return to work, the state of Dr Chen’s
relationship with his previous
employer is such that his return to work might cause disruption and, therefore,
prejudice to Gold
(b) although Dr Chen submitted that he would be prejudiced in not being able to
keep his skills up to date if not working, the Industrial
Commissioner accepted
other evidence that Dr Chen would not lose his certification; and
(c) Gold Coast Health had since arranged its staffing so that it didn’t
require Dr Chen’s services.
[20] By way of
general discretionary considerations, the Industrial Commissioner also had
(a) considerations of the preservation of the status quo, which did not favour
Dr Chen because of the delay between his dismissal
and the application for
interim reinstatement. The status quo, the Industrial Commissioner found, is
now Dr Chen not working at
Gold Coast Health;
(b) delay in the principal proceedings, which had been caused by Dr Chen’s
conduct of the proceedings where he had made various
interlocutory applications
and launched appeals; and
(c) the fact that Dr Chen had not shown any urgent need to return to work.
[21] There was
no appeal from the order of Industrial Commissioner Pidgeon determining the
application for interim reinstatement against
[22] In his
written submissions on costs,
which were before Industrial Commissioner Pidgeon on the application, Dr
(a) made allegations about Gold Coast Health’s conduct in not rostering Dr
(b) alleged that Gold Coast Health was advertising for applicants for employment
in a role similar to that performed by
(c) alleged that Gold Coast Health had appointed new graduates in training for
the role Dr Chen had previously
(d) submitted that four colleagues of Dr Chen had expressed views about
understaffing at Gold Coast
(e) alleged that Gold Coast Health executives had acted
improperly.
The new material
relevance of the various assertions made in Dr Chen’s new affidavit have
to be considered against the following facts:
(a) the new affidavit is sought to be admitted on an appeal from the costs
determination;
(b) the costs determination concerns the costs in the dismissal of the interim
reinstatement application;
(c) Dr Chen lost the reinstatement application; and
(d) Dr Chen has not challenged, by way of appeal, the dismissal of the interim
reinstatement application.
application for interim reinstatement was an interlocutory application.
Therefore, Dr Chen could bring a further application.
However, there has been
no challenge to the Industrial Commissioner’s judgment on the interim
reinstatement application by
way of appeal and no further application has been
brought. The controversy as to the interim reinstatement of Dr Chen is, at the
moment at least, not a live one.
Chen’s affidavit covers various topics:
(a) Professor Howes’ opinion expressed in text messages about Dr
Chen’s interactions with Gold Coast
This evidence was
available at the time of the interim reinstatement application. It was also
available at the time of the hearing
of the costs application. If anything, it
is relevant to considerations of reinstatement, not the costs of the failed
interim reinstatement
application;
(b) there are complaints about inadequate disclosure and other actions of Gold
Coast Health and its employees.
All of this material was available at the time of the hearing of the interim
reinstatement application and at the time of the costs
application. If
anything, it is relevant to questions of interim reinstatement and possibly the
determination of the principal proceedings;
(c) under a heading: “GCHHS genuine permanent operational requirements and
budgeting”, Dr Chen challenges the assertion
of Gold Coast Health made on
the interim reinstatement application that Dr Chen’s services are not
required. This seeks to
reagitate issues raised in the interim reinstatement
application. There is nothing new;
(d) under a heading: “Understaffing consequences around mid 2021”,
Dr Chen challenges the assertions made by Gold Coast
Health as to the adequacy
of staffing levels. Again, if anything, this is relevant to the interim
reinstatement application and
determination of the principal application.
Again, there is nothing new;
(e) under a heading: “Undisclosed conflict of interest – Ms Nikki
A-Khavari and GCHHS and Mr Grant Brown and Ms Hannah
Bloch”, Dr Chen
records what might be criticism by Professor Howes of Ms A-Khavari and records
the fact that Ms A-Khavari
has not responded to emails where Dr Chen has sought
an explanation of what he sees as her acting in a position of conflict of
The relevance of this is dubious at best but Professor Howes’
comments were made on 4 August 2021 and the emails to Ms A-Khavari
were sent in
late 2022 and early 2023, before the hearing of the interim reinstatement
application and the costs application; and
(f) under a heading: “Collegial affidavits and hearing attendance”,
Dr Chen identifies various people who he asserts
can give evidence about what he
says are relevant events within Gold Coast Health. Some of the evidence may be
relevant to the substantive
application but is not relevant to the appeal
against a costs order made consequent upon the dismissal of an interim
reinstatement
application where the result of that application has been accepted
by Dr Chen, to the extent that he has not challenged it on appeal.
Section 567
Industrial Relations Act 2016
Nature of appeal
(1) an appeal to an industrial tribunal, other than a public service appeal
to the commission, it by way of a re-hearing on the record.
(2) However, the industrial tribunal may her evidence afresh or additional
evidence if the industrial tribunal considers it appropriate
to effectively
dispose of the appeal.”
[27] The common
law developed principles as to the admission of further evidence on appeal.
Those principles required an appeal court
to consider the likely impact of the
further evidence, and whether the evidence was reasonably available at first
[28] Although
the statutory test is wider, those common law considerations are relevant in

self-represented. However, he must conduct the proceedings appropriately. The
evidence Dr Chen wishes to adduce was
previously available to him.
[30] Assessment
must also be made as to whether the evidence was likely to alter the result if
it had been available at the
As previously
observed, the correctness of the Industrial Commissioner’s dismissal of
the interim reinstatement application
has not been challenged. The costs
hearing was conducted against the background of the findings in the interim
reinstatement application.
I can see nothing to suggest that the further
material which seeks to reagitate issues considered in the interim reinstatement
application
would have any impact upon the costs determination.
[31] The policy
considerations behind there being restrictions on the introduction and new
evidence on appeal are policy considerations
based on the desirability of
finality of litigation. Here, Dr Chen wishes to introduce evidence on appeal
from the costs order which
was not before the Industrial Commissioner, but was
in existence and readily available to him at the time of the hearing of the
application. The material seeks to reagitate issues determined in the
interim reinstatement application in circumstances where he
