have no certain knowledge
that it came from him, except that it appears to be)
sent this email:
My apologies for not being present today as I
only received notification today in the mail
As I am in Cairns it is impossible for me to be present in Brisbane
I would like to ask the court indulgence to place another hearing in 3 weeks

Yours kindly
Byfield had given notice of the hearing that was to occur on 10 October by post
to that address. She swore it was sent on 1 of
October 2025. It struck me as
odd if that was correct (and I had no reason to doubt it) that the notification
would only have been
received on the 10
and that an email would
only be sent at 3.00pm on 10 October. My Associate was forwarded that email.
At my direction, he sent an
email to Mr Crane, copied to Ms Byfield, Ms
McMillan, who had appeared for O’Connor Law, and Mr Carey, who appears
I will make that response Exhibit 2 in this matter.
email informed Mr Crane of the orders made. It told him reasons would be
provided as soon as possible, which they were on 14
October 2025.
informed of him of his right to apply to vary or set aside the orders under rule
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999
(Qld) relating to circumstances of
non-appearance. It required any application and affidavit material to be
provided by 4.00pm on
16 October 2025, and I listed the matter for hearing at
11.00am today. It also provided for Mr Crane to provide that material by
to my Associate. At that time, I also stayed my orders of 10 October until
further order and gave leave for everyone to attend
by video link or telephone.
Video link details were provided, including by email to Mr Crane. Nothing has
been heard from Mr Crane,
nor has any document apparently been filed by him. I
will make the electronic file index as of 17 October 2025 Exhibit 3 in this
application.
index shows an affidavit of service by Ms Byfield filed 10 October 2025, but
nothing from Mr Crane. Although I would expect
to have received his material by
email in any event. In circumstances where I have heard nothing from Mr Crane,
I intend to lift
the stay order that I made on 10 October 2025. My reasons
record the singular and wrongful lack of engagement by Mr Crane with Ms
Byfield’s application over many years. One would be entitled to be
cynical about first hearing from him at 3.00pm on the afternoon
when orders were
finally made. Whatever about that, Mr Crane has had an opportunity to challenge
those orders, and he has not.
would also emphasise this is a very small estate in the scheme of things. Such
estates call for the performance of formal steps
with utmost alacrity. Being a
litigant in person respondent executor is no excuse for not doing so, even if it
is an explanation.
I note, Mr Carey has provided an affidavit confirming directly from the trustee
the amount of money that was notified to
me on instructions from Ms McMillan on
10 October as available for an order in the estate. I will make Ms
McMillan’s email
of the 10 of October Exhibit 4 in the application, in
which she confirmed her instructions. I also rely on Mr Carey’s helpful
affidavit providing direct evidence from the trustees.
those circumstances, I order that the stay order made by me on the
of October 2025 be discharged. The consequence of that, which I
make clear for the benefit of the trustees and in the presence of
solicitors, is that orders 1 and 2 of my orders recently published, made on the
of October 2025, should and may be performed.
