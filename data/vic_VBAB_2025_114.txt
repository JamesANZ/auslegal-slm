THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENT
Respondent makes the following submissions (summarised):
(a) The QC Policy complies with all the requirements of s 93 of the Act because:
(i) It is issued by QBE Insurance (Australia) Ltd and Certain Underwriters at
Lloyds Unique Market.
(ii) It includes full contract works and public liability cover.
(iii) It has adequate limits of $360,000 for contract works and $5,000,000 for
public liability.
(iv) It is specifically endorsed for protection work.
(b) The Applicant has raised matters outside the jurisdiction of the BAB. The
only issues the BAB can deal with are whether the insurance
complies with s 93
of the Act and whether the amount of cover is adequate.
(c) The documents provided reference protection work and are endorsed to cover
public liability.
(d) The term “protective works” rather than “protection
works” does not invalidate the policy.
(e) Although the Applicant’s name and her property are not specified in
the QC Policy, it has been established by the courts
that an adjoining owner
does not need to be named but must be able to claim as a third party
beneficiary.
(f) The Applicant has disputed the amount of cover for underpinning; however,
there is no underpinning required for this project.
(g) The Act requires insurance coverage but does not require specified monetary
(h) Any period where there was no insurance is outside the jurisdiction of the

has to decide is whether the insurance for the protection

of the BAB.
(k) Compliance with the
Insurance Contracts Act 1984
is outside the
(l) That the Respondent has been referred to as a “principally registered
builder” on some documents, rather than an
“owner builder”
does not affect the validity of the insurance for protection work.
Respondent seeks a determination that the QC Policy is valid and
THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE INTERESTED PARTY
are no submissions from the interested party.
LEGISLATION
(1) Before any protection work is commenced in respect of an adjoining property,
an owner must ensure that a contract of insurance
is in force, in accordance
with this section, against –
(a) damage by the proposed protection work to the adjoining property; and
(b) any liabilities likely to be incurred to adjoining occupiers and members of
the public during the carrying out of the building
work and for a period of 12
months after that building work is completed.
(2) The contract of insurance must be entered into with an insurer for an
(a) agreed to by the owner and the adjoining owner; or
(c) in the event of a dispute, determined by the Building Appeals Board under
(3) The owner must lodge a copy of the contract of insurance with the adjoining
owner before the commencement of protection work.
(4) The owner must ensure the contract of insurance is renewed or extended as
often as may be necessary during the carrying out of
the building work and for
12 months after that work is completed.
Matters outside jurisdiction
find that many of the issues raised, and orders sought by the Applicant fall
outside the BAB’s jurisdiction in a dispute referred
pursuant to s 152 of
the Act. These are as follows:
(a) That building work commenced without protection work insurance being agreed
(b) That building work commenced without protection work insurance being in
(c) The Respondent failing to agree to the supervision of protection work.
(d) The manner and timing of the provision of insurance documents by the
Respondent.
(e) Any period for which there was no insurance cover in place.
(f) Compelling the Respondent to obtain retrospective insurance.
(g) Imposing fines on the Respondent.
(h) There being no guarantee of cover if the insurer becomes insolvent.
Does the QC Policy comply with s 93 of the Act?
Extension of cover under the QC Policy
to the QC Policy Certificate of currency the period of insurance under the
policy expires on 26 June 2026. The Applicant
submits that page 2 of the QC
Policy provides that the QC Policy is non-renewable and therefore not compliant
with s 93(4) of the
note that the QC Policy document provides that the insured may apply for an
extension to the period of insurance, although it does
not guarantee that an
extension will be given. It is therefore open to the Respondent to apply for an
extension of cover.
find that s 93(4) places a future obligation on the Respondent to extend the
cover for protection work while building work is being
carried out and for 12
months after the building work is completed. As of the date of this
determination there is no breach of the
Respondent’s future obligation
under s 93(4).
Limits of cover under the QC Policy (protection
Applicant submits that the QC Policy endorsement for protection work is limited
to the protection work specified in the form 7
and form 8 and does not cover any
works not listed in those notices. For example, the QC Policy would not cover
emergency protection
work that may be required under s 89 of the Act.
is helpful to summarise the protection work procedures and notices required by
a) Form 7 is a notice to an adjoining owner from the owner of land on which
building works are proposed. It details the building
works and protection works
b) Form 8 is the response by the adjoining owner stating either that they agree
to the proposed protection works, or they don’t
agree. Usually, if the
adjoining owner disagrees with proposed protection works, they provide reasons
with the form 8.
c) Form 9 is the determination of the relevant building surveyor (
to the appropriateness of the proposed protection work, after considering the
form 8, and any additional information.
s 93(1)(a) of the Act only refers to proposed protection work I find that the QC
Policy is not deficient because it is limited
to the form 7 and form 8 as it is
the Form 7 on which it is required to contain all of the proposed protection
note that the protection work endorsement also provides:
Further, no
cover exists for loss or damage arising from the performance or implementation
of the Protective Works, which loss or
damage is caused as a result of a fault,
defect, error or omission in design, plan or specification.
find that the exclusions to the protection work cover as described in paragraph
23 above do not meet the requirements of s 93(1)(a)
of the Act which requires
that damage caused by the proposed protection work be covered.
Limits of cover under the QC Policy (public liability)
Applicant submits that damage arising from asbestos, pollution and communicable
diseases are excluded from cover, and that there
is asbestos in a bathroom wall
on the Adjoining Property, which if damaged could form part of a claim.
operative words in the exclusion for asbestos are “liability resulting
from”. This would mean a liability incurred
by the insured (the
Respondent) resulting from, broadly speaking, the use or removal of asbestos by
the Respondent.
s 93 of the Act requires that cover be provided for “any liabilities
likely to be incurred”, therefore any exclusions
for liability that is
“likely to be incurred” will make the policy non-compliant with s 93
of the Act.
find that in an older home the use of asbestos at some stage of its life is
possible and likewise the escape of pollution such as
contaminated soil or water
is also possible during building work. The exclusion for asbestos and
pollution do not meet the
requirements of s 93 of the Act, as they fall into the
category of liabilities that are likely to be incurred.
addition, the exclusions for faulty products and product recall do not meet the
requirements of s 93 of the Act.
therefore find that the QC Policy does not comply with the requirements of s 93
of the Act because the exclusions limit the cover
to less than the coverage of
“any liabilities likely to be incurred” as required by s 93(1)(b) of
Applicant not named in the QC Policy
Applicant submits that her name and property are not listed in the endorsement
to the QC Policy, and therefore it is not clear
that she could make a claim
directly to the insurer.
find that as the endorsement to the policy refers to adjoining properties, then
it is possible for the Applicant to make a claim,
and that is sufficient cover
in accordance with s 93 of the Act. I refer to the decision in
Colonial Range
Pty Ltd v CES- Queen (Vic) Pty
where the Court confirmed
that s 93(1)(a) requires that the owner of damaged property can themselves
directly claim under the insurance,
but this did not mean the adjoining owner
needs to be named personally in the policy schedule. In addition, I refer to the
decision of the Building Appeals Board in case no 454307, which
involved a dispute between the current parties and made findings
on this issue.
It is not necessary for the Applicant to be named in the endorsement or be named
as an interested party.
Other Issues
Applicant submits that the wording in the policy referring to protective works
is not the wording in the Act. I find that, although
it would be more aligned
with the legislation to use the phrase “protection work” throughout
the policy endorsement,
the use of the words “protective works” does
not make the policy non-compliant with s 93 of the Act.
Applicant has queried the $10,000 amounts on the policy schedule for
underpinning and personal injury. The Applicant has misread
the policy. These
amounts are the excess the Respondent must pay if there is a claim under the
public liability section of the QC
Applicant submits the QC Policy references the laws of Australia rather than the
Building Act 1993
. I find that this does not make the QC Policy
non-compliant with s 93 of the Act.
Applicant submits that the Respondent is referred to as a “principally
registered builder” on page two of the policy
endorsement schedule. As the
Respondent is not a principally registered builder this could affect any claim
under the QC Policy.
note that the QC Policy is entitled “Quick Construct Owner Builder
Construction Insurance Product”, and as the certificate
of currency and
the QC Policy endorsement schedule all refer to “owner builder” it
is more probable than not that the
Respondent is covered as an owner builder,
although the Respondent may wish to query that use of that wording in the
endorsement
with the insurer. I find that this does not make the QC Policy
non-compliant with s 93 of the Act.
Applicant submits the definition of existing structures in the QC Policy does
not include her property, including the party wall.
The term “existing
structures” in the QC Policy is used in the Material Damage section of the
QC Policy which covers
“insured damage to the construction works during
the period of the construction works”. It is not relevant to the Public
Liability or Protection Work sections of the QC Policy and endorsement. I find
that this does not make the QC Policy non-compliant
with s 93 of the Act.
the Applicant has not given reasons why she submits the QC Policy does not
comply with
Insurance Contracts Act 1984
and I can see no
obvious issues, I do not find that the QC Policy does not comply with
Insurance Contracts Act 1984
nor am I tasked with making such a
DATED: 15 September 2025
