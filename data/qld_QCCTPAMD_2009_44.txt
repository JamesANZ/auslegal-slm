REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is a decision in a disciplinary proceeding brought by the the Chief Executive,
Department of Employment, Economic Development
and Innovation against the
respondent Desmond John Skelton. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and
decide this disciplinary proceeding
pursuant section 450 of the
Agents and Motor Deals Act 2000
(“the Act”).
Vize of Counsel appeared on behalf of the Chief Executive at the hearing. There
was no appearance by or on behalf of the respondent.
Upon reviewing the
affidavit of service of Ms Savage and the documentation from the
Tribunal’s file, I was satisifed that
the respondent had been given notice
of the time, date and place of today’s hearing and am prepared to proceed
to hear and
decide the application in the absence of the respondent pursuant to
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act 2003
grounds for taking disciplinary action against a licensee (or former licensee)
are found in section 496(1) of the Act. The Chief
Executive relies upon
paragraphs (b)(i), (g)(i) and (g)(iii), which relevantly provide:
496 Grounds for starting disciplinary
proceedings
(1) The following are grounds for starting a disciplinary proceeding against
a licensee or registered employee —
licensee or employee has contravened or breached —
Act, including a code of conduct;
licensee is not a suitable person to hold a licence; or
licensee has, in carrying on a business or performing an activity, been
incompetent or acted in an unprofessional way;”
applicant relies upon grounds, charges and particulars set out in the
disciplinary proceeding application filed 1 May 2009 and
on a statement of
Christine Louise Savage filed on 17 June 2009, together with attachments marked
OFT-1 to OFT-5 and OFT-7 to OFT-21.
At the request of Mr Vize some amendments
were made to the amounts set out in paragraphs four and six of the particulars.
evidence adduced on behalf of the Chief Executive establishes to my satisfaction
that the respondent has engaged in conduct, in
the course of carrying on the
business as a real-estate agent principal licensee, which falls below the
standard expected by other
licensees, to a substantial extent and that the
conduct may be characterised as unprofessional conduct. That conduct consisted
the following:
(a) The receipt
by the respondent of amounts totalling $16,150.00 as rent in respect of a
property managed by the respondent on behalf
of a Mr Phillip Fleming and failing
to account to Mr Fleming for an amount of $3,722.88;
(b) Receiving
an amount of $6,720.00 as rent in respect of properties managed for Ms Carol
Augustine by the respondent and failing
to account to Ms Augustine for $4,662.00
of the monies received; and
(c) Receiving
amounts totalling $11,968.99 as rent in respect of properties managed by the
respondent for the trustees of certain
family trusts and failing to account to
the receivers of those trusts (being persons entitled to receive payments) but
instead paying
amounts totalling $9,966.99 to the original trustees, contrary to
the advice of the receivers.
Chief Executive relies upon sections 573(2), 160(1) and 128(1)(c) of the Act,
which provide:
“573 Wrongful conversion and false
(1) This section applies if a licensee, in the performance of the
activities of a licensee, receives an amount belonging to someone
(2) A licensee who—
(a) dishonestly converts the amount to the licensee’s own or
someone else’s use; or
commits a crime.
Maximum penalty—1000 penalty units or 5 years
imprisonment.”
“160 Acting as real estate agent
(1) A person must not, as an agent for someone else for reward, perform
an activity that may be done under the authority of a real
estate agent’s
licence unless the person—
(a) holds a real estate agent’s licence and the performance of the
activity is authorised under the person’s licence;
(b) is otherwise permitted under this or another Act to perform the
Maximum penalty—200 penalty units or 2 years
imprisonment.”
“128 What a real estate agent’s licence
(1) A real estate agent’s licence authorises the holder of the
real estate agent
) to perform the following activities as an
agent for others for reward—
(c) to collect rents;”
am also satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the respondent’s
conduct in respect of property managed for Mr Fleming
amounted to a
contravention of section 573(2) of the Act in that, having received moneys
belonging to Mr Fleming, the respondent
dishonestly converted those moneys to
his own or to someone else’s use. I am similarly satisfied that the
respondent contravened
the same provision in respect of the moneys received by
him belonging to Ms Augustine, which he dishonestly converted to his own
someone else’s use.
am not satisfied that the respondent contravened section 573(2) of the Act in
respect of monies received for the properties managed
for the family trusts.
This is because on the evidence before me I am not able to be satisfied that the
respondent acted dishonestly
in accounting for those monies to the trustees of
those trusts rather than to the receivers.
am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, after the expiry of the
respondent’s licence on 29 October 2004, the respondent
contravened
section 160(1) of the Act by acting as agent for someone else and performing an
activity that can only be done under
the authority of a real estate
agent’s licence, namely collecting rents for units, which were the
property of the above mentioned
family trusts.
I am also satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the respondent
contravened section 160(1) of the Act in the same
manner by continuing to
collect rents for a property owned by Ms Augustine after the expiry of the
respondent’s licence.
propose to make orders finding that grounds exist for bringing disciplinary
proceedings against the respondent: under section 496(1)(g)(i)
on the basis that
the licensee is not a suitable person to hold a licence; under subsection (iii)
on the basis that the respondent
in carrying on a business and performing
activities has acted in an unprofessional way; and under section 496(1)(b)(i) on
that the respondent has contravened sections 573(2) and 160(1) of the

107 of the CCT Act provides a further basis for the Tribunal’s powers in
deciding disciplinary proceedings:
107 Orders for disciplinary action

(a) an order

(6) The State agency that brought the application may recover an amount
ordered by the tribunal to be imposed as a penalty as a debt
due to it in a
court with jurisdiction up to the amount of the debt.”
the Tribunal is satisfied that there are appropriate grounds for the Chief
Executive to take disciplinary proceedings against
a respondent, the Tribunal
must consider the orders, if any to be made. The nature of this proceeding is
disciplinary rather than
punitive. The power exercised by the tribunal is
“entirely protective and notwithstanding that its exercise may involve
a great deprivation to the person disciplined, there
is no element of punishment
NSW Bar Association v Evatt
[1968] HCA 20
(1968) 117 CLR 177
at 183. In discharging this protective function, the tribunal must frame orders
sufficient to deter repetition of the offending
conduct, indicate to other
licensees that the conduct is unacceptable and maintain public confidence in the
regulation of the industry
under the Act.
persistence of the respondent’s conduct and the period over which it
occurred, as well as the dishonest nature of some of
the conduct, lead me to the
conclusion that the breaches of the Act subject of this disciplinary proceeding
were serious. The amount
of money which was improperly dealt with by the
respondent totals more than $8,000.00. In particular, I am concerned that the
acted as an agent while unlicensed over a period of nine months to
different clients in respect of five properties.
The respondent has not cooperated with the Chief Executive in dealing with the
disciplinary charges or the complaints that gave rise
to them. The respondent
has not accounted for those unaccounted monies to the persons entitled to them.
I also note that $3,722.88
of the unaccounted monies passed through the
respondent’s trust account without being paid out to the persons entitled
and that $4,662.00 of the unaccounted for monies, which plainly ought to
have passed through the respondent’s trust account,
did not do so. None
of the charges or particulars was admitted by the respondent. Nor has there
been any indication of remorse
for the contraventions or the consequences
suffered by the affected consumers. The respondent offered no references or
factors to be considered in determining the appropriate orders.
the extent of the conduct and the absence of any indication of remorse or
concern for the effect upon consumers, it is inappropriate
for the respondent to
hold a licence or certificate of registration under the Act. A significant fine
is also appropriate.
respondent should also pay the Chief Executive’s costs of the proceeding,
which I assess at $2,035.00
the circumstances I consider it appropriate to make the following orders
exist under section 496(1)(b)(i) of the Act for taking disciplinary action
against the respondent, namely that:
(a) The respondent has contravened or breached section
573(2) of the Act by, in the performance of the activities of a real estate
agent principal licensee, receiving amounts belonging to someone else and
dishonestly converting the amounts to his own or someone
else’s use; and
(b) The respondent has contravened section 160(1) of the Act, by, as an agent
for someone else for reward, collecting rents when the
respondent did not hold a
real estate agent’s licence and was not otherwise permitted under the Act
or another Act to collect
exist under section 496(1)(g)(iii) of the Act for taking disciplinary action
against the respondent, namely that the respondent
has, in carrying on a
business or performing an activity as a real estate , acted in an unprofessional
way, namely that the respondent
has engaged in the conduct referred to in order
1(a) above.
exist under section 496(1)(g)(i) of the Act for taking disciplinary action
against the respondent, namely that, in the circumstances
referred to in orders
1 and 2 above, the respondent is not a suitable person to hold a licence.
to section 529(1)(d)(ii) of the Act the respondent is disqualified permanently
from holding a licence or registration certificate
under the Act.
to section 529(1)(b) of the Act the respondent is to pay to the applicant a fine
of $6,000.00, by 4:00pm on 9 November 2009.
to section 71 of the CCT Act
the respondent is to pay the
applicant’s costs of the proceedings fixed in the amount of $2,035.00, by
