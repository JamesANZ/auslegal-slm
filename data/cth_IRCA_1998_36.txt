REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
(revised from
transcript)
HIS HONOUR: In these matters I delivered a
judgment on 25 May of this year in which I held that the applicants were not
from pursuing their claims in the Court by reason of litigation before
tribunals established under State law, but concluded that
prima facie
there was a case for staying the proceedings because to suffer the
continuance of them might be an abuse of the Court's process.
I noted that
relief in that regard was discretionary, that exclusion of a party had always
been regarded as an extreme step, that
there might have been some witting or
unwitting acquiescence by the respondent in the seeming efforts by each
applicant to litigate
their grievances twice, and that any such acquiescence
might have legal consequences.
The matter has been further investigated.
It seems that applications for relief were made to this Court on 20 February
1996 and that
in February and March there were conciliation conferences before
Commissioners of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission,
as it then was,
with a view to settling the matter. There is no material before me as to what
was said or not said before the Commission.
This is understandable and even if
the respondent did nothing to assert its complaints that the proceedings were
estopped or an
abuse of process, I would be reluctant to hold that against the
respondent. Parties ought not be discouraged from freely trying
agreement without prejudice to their legal rights. The fact that they do so,
without asserting legal rights, ought not,
in general, to be taken to be an
acquiescence in the competency of the proceedings in the context of which the
conciliation efforts
are occurring.
There was then on 17 June 1997 a
short directions hearing before a Deputy Registrar of the Court. A legal
representative of the applicants
then indicated that there was some final avenue
of “internal appeal” open to the applicants, but he nevertheless
a date for hearing. There was no objection to that course by the
representative for the respondent. That avenue of internal appeal
The matter then came on for hearing before a Judicial Registrar on 30
September 1996. The question of cause of action estoppel was
raised before the
Judicial Registrar, and she upheld that claim. It was from that decision that
the application for review to me
was brought. There is no dispute that a few
days before the matter was heard by the Judicial Registrar, notice of the
contentions
of the respondent was given to the legal representatives of the
applicants and that this notice included reference to a claim of
estoppel. It
does not seem to me, therefore, that it has been shown that the respondent
acquiesced or failed to act in a reasonably
prompt way to assert its view that
the proceedings in the Court were, one way or the other, incompetent. Nothing
turns on the fact
that my own legal analysis was based not on estoppel but an
abuse of process.
In consequence, and conformably with my earlier
judgment, the order of the Court should be that in each case the application for
be permanently stayed as an abuse of the process of the Court.
