REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
1. This is the determination of an application dated 23 August 2010, pursuant
Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1986
(“the Act”), seeking a review of a decision assessing the
applicant’s levy rate for the financial year 2010-2011,
embodied in
correspondence from WorkCover dated 4 June 2010.
, at the relevant time, provided as follows:
(1) Where an employer considers that a decision of the Corporation as
(aa) the estimate of remuneration that is to be used for the calculation of a
(a) the fixing or assessment of a levy; or
(b) the imposition of penalty interest or a fine; or
(c) the imposition or variation of a condition of a kind that may lead to the
imposition of a supplementary levy,
is unreasonable, the board must, on application by the employer, review the
(2) An application for review does not suspend a liability to pay a levy,
penalty interest or a fine.
(3) The review will be conducted, in accordance with procedures determined
by the board, by the board itself, or by a committee or
person to whom the board
has delegated its powers of review under this section, and the board has an
absolute discretion as to whether
it will permit the employer or a
representative of the employer to be heard orally on the review.
(4) On review, the board may—
(aa) alter an estimate;
(a) alter a levy or an assessment;
(b) quash or reduce penalty interest or a fine;
(c) direct the repayment of amounts overpaid;
(d) quash or vary a
condition imposed by the Corporation. …
3. Section 67 of the Act, on which the application focuses, at the relevant
time provided (so far as is relevant):
67—Adjustment
of levy in relation to individual employers
(1) The Corporation may, in relation to a particular employer, having regard
to all or any of the following matters—
(a) the adequacy or inadequacy of measures taken by the employer to reduce
the incidence of work related traumas;
(b) the incidence or costs of claims for compensable disabilities suffered by
the employer’s workers (disregarding claims of
a class excluded from the
ambit of this paragraph by regulation);
(c) the rehabilitation facilities or services for disabled workers provided
by the employer, or the absence or inadequacy of such
facilities or services
provided by the employer;
(ca) the employer’s practices and procedures in connection with the
appointment and work of a rehabilitation and return to work
co‑ordinator
under Part 3 (including with respect to compliance with any relevant guidelines
published by the Corporation for
the purposes of section 28D);
(d) the employer’s practices as to the retention, employment or
re-employment of disabled workers (and, in particular, any failure
employer’s part to provide, in accordance with this Act, employment to a
worker who has suffered a compensable disability
in the employer's
employment);
(e) such other matters (whether similar or dissimilar to those referred to
above) as the Corporation considers relevant,
grant to the employer a
remission of the levy that would be otherwise payable or impose on the employer
a supplementary levy (as the
case may require). …
4. Broadly stated, the applicant’s grounds for its belief that the
assessment in question was unreasonable were that it had
not received an
appropriate remission of levy under section 67(1) as it had enjoyed in previous
years. It was simply charged the
base industry levy for its SAWIC (South
Australian WorkCover Industrial Classification) category. The final levy payable
was therefore
greatly in excess of its total in previous years. This followed
the closure from 1 July 2010 by WorkCover of its former automatic
“bonus/penalty scheme” under the consolidated scheme for the
granting of remissions of levy and imposition of supplementary
levies, known as
the Levy Adjustment Scheme (see
South Australian Government Gazette
August 2009, p.3712), which we will refer to as “LAS09” to
distinguish it from earlier versions of the Levy Adjustment
Scheme and to
provide consistency with references in the case of
SouthLink v.
[2009] SASC 175
(2009) 104 SASR 172
(2009) 184 IR 72.
A preliminary question
5. In accordance with her instructions, Ms Emmett contended at the outset
that there was no reviewable decision, because no decision
under section 67 had
been made. Because of the closure of the bonus/penalty scheme, those responsible
for issuing levy notices for
2010-2011 simply had not turned their minds to
section 67, and in particular to section 67(1)(b), at all.
6. Ms Emmett’s argument was the same as that mounted by her in the case
Salisbury Private Nursing Home v. WorkCover
[2012] SAWLRP 4
which is also published today. Several cases in which aggrieved employers sought
consideration under section 67 were heard over
a short period.
7. Unlike that case, and the cases of
Longford Cleaning v.
[2012] SAWLRP 6
Ahrens Group v. WorkCover
[2012] SAWLRP 5
, both also published today, in this case WorkCover did analyse
the employer’s arguments for consideration under various paragraphs
section 67(1) in its reconsideration document, after the application for review
had been lodged, in the end rejecting those arguments.
Apart from that factor,
the situation in the present case was exactly the same as in
Private Nursing Home
, and the arguments mounted by Ms Emmett were, as we
have said, the same. Our view is the same as in
Salisbury Private Nursing
, and we need not repeat it in detail. It is sufficient to say that
the decision under consideration is the “fixing or assessment
levy”, i.e., the levy notice of 4 June 2010, which any employer professing
a belief that the decision is unreasonable
is entitled to have reviewed. Such a
review necessarily entails consideration of any discretion that might or might
not have been
exercised in the course of the assessment, and its exercise
“afresh and unimpeded by the manner in which the Corporation exercised
discretion” — or, in this case, unimpeded by the manner in which the
Corporation
from exercising it: see King CJ,
[1988] SASC 960
(1988) 49 SASR 556
at 559, in reference to a different but
analogous power of review in the 1986 Act, as it stood at the time His Honour
was writing.
8. Accordingly, we proceed to conduct a review of the decision.
Background facts
9. As is usually the case in matters of this sort, the factual setting is not
in any real dispute. The real dispute concerns the conclusions
to be drawn from
the facts, and the ultimate question is whether circumstances are demonstrated
where it is appropriate to exercise
the discretion Parliament has seen fit to
provide under section 67(1).
10. The employer was registered as an employer under the Act on 19 June 2000
in the SAWIC of
511101 Road Freight Transport
, and has so remained ever
since. The industry levy rate in that year was 6.7% of declared leviable
remuneration, but in the following
year (the 2001-2002 financial year) it fell
to 5.8%, before rising in 2002-2003 to 5.9%. In 2003-2004, the industry levy
to 6.9%, but the employer that year became eligible for inclusion in
the bonus/penalty scheme under one of the predecessors of LAS09
(the terms of
all such schemes were identical in respects material to this application) and
enjoyed a 15% remission of levy on the
basis of its favourable claims record
over the preceding years, reducing the base rate to 5.865%. In 2004-2005, the
industry rate
rose to 7.4%, but the employer received a 17% bonus, producing the
final rate of 6.142%. In 2005-2006, the industry rate rose to
7.5%, which is the
maximum rate permitted for any industry under section 66 of the Act. The
industry rate has remained at 7.5% since.
The employer’s 2005-2006
remission rose to 21%, producing a final rate of 5.925%. In 2006-2007, the
employer’s remission
fell to 1% (for reasons which will shortly become
apparent), so that the final levy was 7.425% in that year. In 2007-2008, the
became a supplement of 4%, producing a final levy rate of 7.8%. In
2008-2009, a remission of 10% was applied, producing a final levy
rate of 6.75%.
In 2009-2010, the remission rose to 27%, the highest so far, producing a final
levy rate of 5.475%.
11. Under the terms of LAS09, the bonus/penalty scheme, which had hitherto
provided for automatic remissions and supplements on the
basis of claims costs
incurred in the two preceding calendar years, was discontinued from 1 July 2010.
Therefore, in 2010-2011, the
unadjusted industry levy rate of 7.5% was applied
to the employer’s Gillman workplace. This was the reviewable decision
on 4 June 2010.
12. The book of documents placed before us by WorkCover shows the
employer’s and the industry’s claims record for the
decade up to the
reviewable decision under consideration. We set out in the following table the
employer’s claims numbers and
costs and the corresponding average figures
for the locations registered in the relevant SAWIC.

675/1 679 = 0.4
$7 193 778/1 679 = $4 285
13. To provide some context to the
applicant’s figures, it seems desirable to compare it to the
“average” location
in the industry. WorkCover has provided us with
the declared leviable remuneration of the applicant, and of the SAWIC as a
By dividing the declared leviable remuneration of the SAWIC as a whole by
the number of locations making up the SAWIC, a rough comparison
may be made.
Taking the latest two years, we find that in 2009 the applicant’s declared
remuneration was nearly double that of the “average” location,
and in 2010 about 1.6 times the “average”.
The evidence of the applicant
14. Sworn evidence was given by Joe Peplinski, managing director of the
applicant, and Marie Ellen Thomas, a rehabilitation consultant
Australia (formerly the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service). In addition, there
were letters by various other witnesses
and submissions by Ms Ashton. There was
no significant dispute about any of the factual matters put to us.
15. Mr Peplinski described how he had owned the business for 10 years. It was
described as a small transport company with 10 staff,
10 subcontractors, no
long-distance or heavy haulage, resulting in less risk than most employers in
the SAWIC category. He said the
loads consisted mostly of pallets or parcels. He
spoke of dangerous goods guidelines, but said that no “licensable”
goods were carried. One category carried was cleaning products. He
said it was necessary to know “what can go with what”.
16. He gave evidence about the three claims incurred in 2004 and 2005. One he
said was clearly a secondary disability (the aggravation
of a pre-existing
. He emphasised comparisons
with the industry. We were supplied with a copy of the company’s OH&S
(occupational health and
safety) policy, with guidelines for all personnel,
contractors and visitors to the workplace. Included were:
 Dangerous Goods Basics and update;
 Danger identification list;
 Memo to all staff re unloading of trucks at delivery points;
 OH&S audit tool;
 Safe work procedures for movement of loads;
 Procedures for fire and other emergencies;
 Daily work and rest hours planner;
 Explanation of standard hours;
 Induction list;
 Work placement training log.
17. Ms Ashton’s submission pointed out the employer’s “keen
and active interest” in the rehabilitation of
injured and disabled
workers, demonstrated by success in assisting disabled workers to return
successfully to the workforce. A number
of instances were set out in
testimonials and case studies set out in the book of documents. Some of these
were from well-known rehabilitation
providers (including Ms Thomas), while
others were from grateful workers.
18. In our respectful opinion, Mr Peplinski was unduly modest about these
cases. Ms Ashton drew our attention to them, and Ms Thomas
elaborated most
eloquently on his behalf.
19. Ms Thomas had been a rehabilitation consultant with CRS for 18 years. She
had worked with workers compensation clients in most
states and had spent 10
years working solely with Centrelink clients. She listed her professional
qualifications in psychology, physiology,
social science, rehabilitation and
medical radiography. She observed that few clients had one problem alone.
20. Ms Thomas said she had known and worked with Mr Peplinski on and off for
10 years. He had repeatedly undertaken work experience
placements for her, and
most had ended in employment. (Mr Peplinski interjected that one of these had
been a RISE (WorkCover’s
Re-employment Incentive Scheme for Employers)
placement). She said CRS had the support of Mr Peplinski for work hardening for
cases. She said he was “always prepared to give the underdog a
go”. They were not always the easiest of people. They
were often angry
young men. She said Mr Peplinski had great patience.
21. Significantly, Ms Thomas said that half the clients placed with the
employer for work training were “failed WorkCover rehabilitation
clients”. Some had moved on to better things afterwards; she said they
often “popped in” to tell her how they were
going. She said Mr
Peplinski trained them in OH&S and equipment use and gave safety advice. She
said her function was to monitor
progress and keep in contact. She said Mr
Peplinski always tried to give clients some sort of work after a placement. They
were usually
people no one else would look at.
22. Mr Peplinski said that these were matters about which he didn’t
like to make a lot of noise. He was only bringing them up
now because he had to
make a case. The company had 35.6% fewer claims than the industry average, 94.3%
lower total claims costs to
leviable remuneration than the industry average, and
costs per claim were 84.9% less than the industry average.
23. Mr Peplinski said he was proactive, maintaining the employment of injured
workers. He said one of his earliest rehabilitation
cases had just celebrated
her tenth anniversary as a driver. He said he was in the business of recognising
employees who are doing
their very best. He said the negative view was that
WorkCover was all about the dollar, KPIs (key performance indicators) and
benchmarks,
and not really about the injured employee at all, which was
detrimental to WorkCover’s reason for existence.
24. Ms Emmett made the same submissions in
relation to section 67 and the discontinuance of the bonus/penalty scheme that
made in the case of
Salisbury Private Nursing Home v.
[2012] SAWLRP 4
and other cases on which decisions are also
published today, and our views are set out in those decisions. She conceded that
applicant was a “very good employer”, but maintained it was
still reasonable in all the circumstances not to award a
remission. She
contended that government incentives were available for the employment of the
disabled. (Ms Thomas interjected that
that was true in only one of her cases,
and that the employer had failed to take up available incentives in another
case.) Ms Emmett
contended that the employer had taken adequate measures but was
required to do that, and while acknowledging claims were low, pointed
they were not nil. She said the case studies indicated that the employer was to
be commended, but not necessarily rewarded
with a discretionary remission of its
levy, which should not cover WorkCover claimants
injured. She
said there was no basis for a remission.
25. We take into account all the matters put to us and contained in the book
of documents, including matters we may not have traversed
specifically in these
reasons. The applicant operates in a notoriously high-risk industry (as
illustrated by the industry base rate,
which at 7.5% is the maximum possible)
and has shown mostly outstanding results.
26. We have to say that we were most impressed with Mr Peplinski’s work
with Ms Thomas and her rehabilitation clients, and indeed,
his work with other
rehabilitation consultants who provided “testimonials” and their
clients. However, we consider we
need to be careful to confine our consideration
to matters relating to WorkCover and occupational health and safety. Assistance
Centrelink clients who are strictly Centrelink clients is something we may be
enthusiastic about, but it is not the responsibility
of the WorkCover
Compensation Fund to reward these activities.
27. It seems, however, that many of the Centrelink clients were
“strictly” Centrelink clients. A significant number of them were
Centrelink clients because they had previously suffered
workplace injuries and
were unable to be rehabilitated successfully by the WorkCover system. (Some may
refer to the proverbial workers
compensation “scrapheap”.) While
these clients may not have been subject to weekly payments of income maintenance
continuing rehabilitation efforts at the time Ms Thomas brought them to Mr
Peplinski, we think the previous WorkCover failures to
assist them back into the
workforce provide sufficient nexus to enliven our discretion under section 67(1)
— the final paragraph
of which, as has been observed previously, is very
wide in its terms.
28. Our view is that these matters, in combination with the whole of the
circumstances put to us, justify a conclusion that the applicant
partial remission of levy. We have discussed our approach to the quantum of such
remissions in
Salisbury Private Nursing Home
, at [93]-[97].
29. Notwithstanding the apparent size of the employer’s operations in
the context of other locations in the SAWIC (see [
]), the employer on its reported
workforce is a very small employer. Bearing this in mind with the fact that the
total levy is considerably
less than in the other cases we have considered
recently, we fix the remission in this case at the sum of $5 000 for the
levy year. As the levy has, no doubt, been paid by now, we think it
will be sufficient if this amount is credited in the Compensation
Fund against
the employer’s future liabilities.
Determination
30. Pursuant to our delegated powers under section 72 of the Act, we vary
the reviewable decision, being the assessment of levy dated
4 June 2010.
Pursuant to section 67(1) of the Act, the levy is adjusted by a remission in the
sum of $5 000.

It appears that the
claims agent did not accept that this was so, and the employer did not lodge an
application for review at the
appropriate time (which would have been within two
months of receipt of the levy rate decision on which the claim impacted). Had
done so successfully, his remission of levy (“bonus”) in the
relevant year might have been greater than it was.
