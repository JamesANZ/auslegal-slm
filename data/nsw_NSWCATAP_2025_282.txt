REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
2 September 2025 our reasons for allowing the appeal in this matter were
published (Reasons). We made an order under
section 150
Strata Schemes
Management Act 2015
declaring that Special By-Law 19 adopted by the
respondent (Owners Corporation) was harsh, unconscionable or oppressive. The
made included orders permitting either party to make an application for
costs, setting a timetable for written submissions and requiring
the parties to
indicate in any submissions whether or not they consented to the Appeal Panel
deciding the question of costs by considering
the written submissions, rather
than also having an oral hearing.
were subsequently made by consent extending the times for applying for costs and
lodging submissions.
Owners Corporation lodged submissions in relation to costs which are date
stamped by the Tribunal as having been received on 24
September 2025. The
appellant ( Ms Shah) lodged submissions in response which are date stamped 26
September 2025.The Owners Corporation
lodged submissions in reply which are date
stamped 8 October 2025.
losing the appeal, the Owners Corporation has made an application for an order
in its favour for the costs of the appeal pursuant
and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013
(NCAT Act). Ms Shah opposes the
application for costs by the Owners Corporation and also seeks an order in her
favour for the costs
of the costs application brought by the Owners
Corporation.
its submissions the Owners Corporation did not indicate, as was required by our
orders, whether or not it consented to the Appeal
Panel deciding the question of
costs on the papers. Ms Shah stated that she consented to the issue of costs
being dealt with on the
papers. In the circumstances we are satisfied that it is
appropriate to make an order under section 50 (2) of the NCAT Act dispensing
with an oral hearing on the issue of costs.
The application for
costs by the Owners Corporation
Owners Corporation relied on section 60(2) and (3) of the NCAT Act, submitting
that there were special circumstances warranting
an award of costs in its
favour. The Owners Corporation relied on three matters which it said constituted
special circumstances.
It submitted that:
(a) None of the twelve grounds of appeal relied on by Ms Shah was successful. Ms
Shah only succeeded on the basis of a different
ground first raised by the
Appeal Panel during the hearing of the appeal;
(b) Ms Shah’s oral submissions were “ a re-hash and waste of
time”. The appeal could have been determined on the
papers; and
(c) The appeal was otiose, that is, unnecessary
The grounds of appeal
[14] of the Reasons we set out the twelve grounds of appeal. At [15]-[16] of the
Reasons we expressed some criticism of the way
in which the grounds of appeal
had been framed and at [17] of the Reasons we reframed the grounds of appeal
into four contentions.
The second contention was that Special By-Law 19 was
harsh, unconscionable or oppressive because it imposed an absolute prohibition
and did not give a lot owner the opportunity to demonstrate that the relevant
proposal would not have an adverse impact on other
lot owners. This reframed
appeal grounds 4,5,6 and 12.
[49] of the Reasons we concluded that Special By- Law 19 was harsh ,
unconscionable or oppressive because it did not require the
Owners Corporation
to give consideration to the individual circumstances of a lot owner’s
proposal, which might demonstrate
that the proposal was atypical and did not
affect other lot owners. This upheld those grounds of appeal encapsulated in
what is described
above as the second contention.
certain integers in our reasoning in reaching this conclusion developed from our
own analysis of the decision in
Cooper v The Owners- Strata Plan No. 58068
[2020] NSWCA 250
and from exchanges with the legal representatives
during the course of argument on the hearing of the appeal, it is incorrect to
that none of the twelve grounds of appeal was successful. This submission
by the Owners Corporation is not accepted.
The appellant’s
oral submissions
oral submissions of both parties were of significant value to us in reaching our
determination. Oral exchanges with the representatives
of both parties
concerning the implications to be drawn from the wording of Special By-Law 19
assisted us greatly in refining the
Concessions
made by the representative for Ms Shah during the course of the argument were
made correctly and were of assistance to
us in narrowing the issues. As
submitted by Ms Shah, appropriate concessions and reframing of arguments by
legal representatives
in the course of oral argument are to encouraged rather
than censured. In this case they are certainly do not amount to special
circumstances
warranting an adverse costs order. This submission by the Owners
Corporation is not accepted.
Whether the appeal was
Owners Corporation submission on this issue involved a number of elements.
First, the Owners Corporation recounted that a by-law
proposed by Ms Shah to
approve her proposed renovations was rejected by the Owners Corporation ; the
Tribunal rejected an application
by Ms Shah for an order under section 149 of
Strata Schemes Management Act
(SSMA) that her proposed
by-law was unreasonably refused; and Ms Shah had not appealed that decision.
These are matters of record
and are referred to at [4],[6] and [7] of the
the Owners Corporation submitted that the Tribunal’s reasons for rejecting
Ms Shah’s proposed by-law therefore
still stand and cannot be re-litigated
because of an issue estoppel.
the Owners Corporation asserted that the proposed renovations including a second
bathroom were nevertheless carried out by
Ms Shah without the approval of the
Owners Corporation. This does not wholly accord with the Tribunal’s
reasons at [170], to
which we referred to at [6] of the Reasons. At [6] of the
Reasons we stated that the Tribunal had noted at [170] that there was a
of artificiality in adjudicating on Ms Shah’s application under section
149 of the SSMA because on 18 May 2024 the Owners
Corporation had passed a
different by-law proposed by Ms Shah which permitted a revised proposal for only
one bathroom in place of
the existing kitchen and that at the time the Tribunal
hearing the works agreed to by the Owners Corporation on 18 May 2024 were
partially completed. The Tribunal had made certain findings of fact about the
revised proposal at [72]-[73] and [77]-[86].
the Owners Corporation stated that as the works were carried out by Ms Shah
without the required approval, they may be subject
to a reinstatement
application by the Owners Corporation. The Owners Corporation asserted that Ms
Shah still required retrospective
approval for her unauthorised works and if
that approval was refused for the same merit reasons as its original refusal, Ms
could not challenge that refusal , despite winning the appeal. The Owners
Corporation claimed that “
to the extent the Appellant commenced this
appeal in order to have illegally carried out works approved or ratified at some
in the future, this whole appeal has been a waste of both parties’
time and money”.
Shah did not address the submissions by the Owners Corporation to the effect
that the appeal was otiose. In its submissions in
reply the Owners Corporation
noted this and submitted that
“it can be inferred that [Ms Shah] does
not dispute, and accepts, the submissions made by the [Owners
Corporation]”.
the reasons may have been for Ms Shah not to respond in terms to these
submissions by the Owners Corporation, we cannot accept
them. Insofar as the
Owners Corporation made submissions about the nature of the renovations in fact
carried out by Ms Shah, they
do not accord with the findings made by the
Tribunal to which we have referred and there was no evidence put before us to
those factual matters. Insofar as the submissions by the Owners
Corporation made predictions about future action it may take or speculated
Ms Shah’s intentions in bringing the appeal, again this was not the
subject of any evidence put before us which would
justify us making findings of
this nature.
if all the factual assertions and predictions made by the Owners Corporation in
relation in these submissions could be accepted,
they would not in our view
warrant a conclusion that the appeal successfully challenging the legality of
Special By-Law 19 adopted
by the Owners Corporation was unnecessary. Absent a
successful appeal, Special By-Law 19 would have stood as an unlawful impediment
to potential renovations by Ms Shah.
our view none of the matters raised by the Owners Corporation constitute special
circumstances which would justify us making an
order for costs in favour of the
Owners Corporation as the unsuccessful party to the appeal. We propose to
dismiss the application
for costs by the Owners Corporation.
application for costs by Ms Shah
Shah has not sought an order for the costs of the appeal. but has sought an
order for costs in relation to the costs application
brought by the Owners
Corporation.
preliminary issue in respect of this application has been raised by the Owners
Corporation. It has submitted in reply that the Tribunal
has no power to make an
order for costs in respect of its costs application. It submits that this is
because the Tribunal doers not
have power to make a costs order for part of the
proceedings, only “ in relation to proceedings” under section 60 (2)
of the NCAT Act. The Owners Corporation did not cite any authority in support of
this submission.
very much doubt the correctness of this submission by the Owners Corporation and
strongly consider the better view to be that the
Tribunal has power to make an
order for costs in respect of a costs application brought before it for
determination. This is supported
by the terms of section 60(2) of the NCAT Act,
which refer to the “proceedings before it”.
“Proceedings”
is not a defined term in the NCAT Act. However the
expression is used in various places in the Act to indicate that a broad
interpretation
is appropriate, e.g. section 50 of the Act, which deals with when
a hearing is required and when it may be dispensed with in proceedings.
consider the better view to be that the only proceedings currently before us are
the costs applications, the substantive appeal
having been determined.
view which we prefer is also emphasised by section 60(5)(b) of the NCAT Act
which defines “costs” to include “the
costs of or incidental
to, the proceedings giving rise to the application or appeal, as well as the
costs of or incidental to the
application or appeal”. The second limb of
this definition supports the view that costs may be awarded in respect of an
application
is however, not appropriate nor necessary to express a final view on this
submission by the Owners Corporation. It is not appropriate
because the issue
has only arisen in reply by the Owners Corporation so we have not had the
benefit of submissions on the issue from
Ms Shah. It is not necessary because we
have determined that even if we have power to make an order in favour of Ms Shah
of the costs application, we would not exercise our discretion to do
we consider the application for the costs of the appeal by the Owners
Corporation, as the unsuccessful party to the appeal,
to have been weak, we do
not consider that the application unreasonably prolonged the proceedings. Nor do
we consider the application
to have been frivolous or misconceived, particularly
in circumstances where the submissions by Ms Shah did not address one of the
bases on which the Owners Corporation sought an order for costs.
these circumstances we will dismiss the application by Ms Shah for the costs of
the costs application.
