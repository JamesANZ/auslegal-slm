APPEARANCES:
PT Burke (agent, Menora Developments Pty Ltd) for the appellants
Quayle (instructed by In-house Legal, Valuer-General) for the respondent
[1] The appellants own Lot 910 on plan number SP226193, located
at Blackstump Ct, Gilston, City of Gold Coast, QLD, 4211, which has
33.94 ha (“the Land”).
[2] The Valuer-General issued an annual
valuation of the Land as at 1 October 2019 of $3,400,000. The previous valuation
October 2017, was $580,000. The valuation notice was in the form
required by
Land Valuation Act 2010
[3] The appellants objected to the new valuation pursuant to
of the Act. Consequently, on 3 March 2021, the Valuer-General altered the
valuation to $2,650,000.
[4] The Valuer-General’s decision on
objection, given under
reason for my decision is:
After further
consideration of adverse characteristics associated with the land, a greater
allowance has been made resulting in a
change in the valuation of the
The appeal to the Land Court
[5] The appellants appealed to the Land Court against the
objection decision. The appellants claimed there should be a deduction for
improvements of $770,400. This would result in the site valuation being
$1,879,600.
[6] The grounds of appeal to the Land Court were stated to be:
“THE NEW SITE VALUATION FAILS TO TAKE INTO
ACCOUNT THE VALUE OF THE WORKS THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN ON THE SITE SINCE ITS
AND WHILE IT HAS REMAINED IN CONTINOUS PART OWNERSHIP OF THE
REGISTERED OWNERS IN COMMON.
THE SITE IMPROVEMENT VALUE CLAIMED ONLY RELATES TO THE PORTION OWNED BY
MENORA DEVELOPMENTS PTY LTD AND DOES NOT EXCEED THE ACTUAL
COSTS INCURRED IN
INCREASING THE SITES [sic] VALUE AND IS FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE PAID INVOICES
ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE
TO THE SITE TO INCREASE ITS VALUE EVEN
THOUGH THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS EXCEEDS THE COSTS OF THOSE
IMPROVEMENTS. ONLY
THE ACTUAL COST OF THE APPLICABLE IMPROVEMENT WORKS HAVE BEEN
[7] On 23 July 2021, the Land Court allowed an application by
the Valuer-General, the present respondent, to have the appeal struck
basis the Land Court had no jurisdiction to deal with
respondent’s successful argument before the Land Court was that no
decision had been made in relation to site improvements
so there could be no
appeal on that matter. In reaching that conclusion, the Court considered the
provisions in sub-div 1 of div
5 of the Act, which provide for making a site
improvement deduction, and the provisions which allow for an appeal.
Land Court concluded:
“[19] The language
of all sections dealing with deduction applications is mandatory, not
permissive. If a person does not comply
with the framework, the Valuer-General
cannot make a decision. A person cannot appeal if the Valuer-General has not
made a decision.
It may be tempting to interpret “decision” in its
widest sense – any decision on the objection – but the
requirements of the LVA about deduction applications call for a narrower
The appeal to this Court
[10] On 3 September 2021, the appellants appealed to this
Court, seeking to have the decision of the Land Court set aside and the
remitted to that Court for rehearing.
[11] The Notice of Appeal to this Court
records that the appellants were not legally represented. While the grounds of
appeal appear
to be in the form of written submissions, the substance of the
appeal can be found within the 37 paragraphs in the Notice of Appeal.
[12] In essence, the appellants contend they were free to appeal to the Land
Court on other evidence to what they might have chosen
to put forward at the
[13] The appellants submit that, after the appeal to the Land Court was
filed, they provided the respondent, and the Court, with the
information which s
41(2) of the Act requires for a deduction for site improvements. Accordingly, a
deduction for site improvements
was before the Land Court in the appeal.
Consideration
[14] Section 155(1) of the Act provides:
An objector may appeal to the Land Court against the
objection decision for the objection.
[15] The decision on
states that
the “valuation amount has been altered to $2,650,000”, and that the
reason for the decision is “after
further consideration of adverse
characteristics associated with the land... a greater allowance has been made,
resulting in a change
in the valuation of the property”.
objection decision does not say anything about a deduction for site improvement
costs having been made.
[17] The appellants accept that:
“...the respondent
did not include is [sic] his assessment of the objection the issue related to a
site improvement deduction
the objector/appellant contends that the respondent
did in fact decide on the objection against the initial site
valuation.”
[18] This concession is sufficient to determine the appeal in
favour of the respondent, having regard to the requirement of s 155
[19] However, the appellants relied on a number of other contentions to
submit that the Land Court erred in summarily determining
to strike out the
[20] First, the appellants submit that
Land Court Act
assists them. It is equivalent to
, which applies to the Land Court, and
is in the following terms:
Land Appeal Court to be guided by equity and good conscience
In the exercise of its jurisdiction, the Land Appeal Court—
(a) is not bound by the rules of evidence and may inform itself in the way
it considers appropriate; and
(b) must act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits
of the case without regard to legal technicalities and
forms or the practice of
other courts.
[21] The meaning and scope of
was considered by Keane JA
(as his Honour then was), with whose reasons McMurdo P and White J agreed, in
Townsville City Council
& Anor v Department of Main
“[38] The precise effect of a provision such as
of the Act will
depend on the nature of the decision to be made by the relevant tribunal. In
Qantas Airways Ltd v Gubbins
, Gleeson CJ and Handley JA noted that:
“The words ‘equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of
the case’ are not terms of art and have no fixed
legal meaning independent
of the statutory context in which they are found ...”
[39] A statutory exhortation to have regard to "equity, good conscience and
the substantial merits of the case" must be given effect.
As Olsson J pointed
Trittenheim Pty Ltd, Heaney & Heaney v H & H Gill Nominees Pty
“What must firmly be borne in mind is that what is appropriate in a
particular case must derive from a consideration of the
nature of the issues
involved and, where appropriate, the clear intendment of any statute applicable.
These may patently demand an
application of strict principles of law or of a
statute either because the notion of equity, good conscience or the substantial
of the case unerringly points to the need or desirability of so doing, or
the statute expressly or impliedly mandates such an approach...
However, in certain types of case ... there remains scope for the court ...
to adopt a broad approach of common sense and common fairness,
eschewing all
legal or other technicality. If it were otherwise then a mandate to 'act
according to equity, good conscience and the
substantial merits of the case
without regard to technicalities ... ' would have little or no room to operate
[40] The view that the inclusion of such a provision widens rather than
restricts the discretion available to a decision-maker has
received support in
the High Court. In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu,
the High Court was concerned
with construing s 420 of the
Migration Act 1958
(Cth), which provides:
“(1) The Tribunal, in carrying out its functions under this Act, is to
pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of review
that is fair, just,
economical, informal and quick.
(2) The Tribunal, in reviewing a decision:
(a) is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence; and
(b) must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the
[41] Gleeson CJ and McHugh J noted that such provisions:
“... are intended to be facultative, not restrictive. Their purpose is
to free tribunals, at least to some degree, from constraints
applicable to courts of law, and regarded as inappropriate to tribunals. The
extent to which they free tribunals from obligations
applicable to the courts of
law may give rise to dispute in particular cases, but that is another
[42] An example of how effect may be given to such a provision is provided
by the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court
of South Australia in
Featherston v Tully
. The case concerned the operation of the Supreme
Court of South Australia when sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns under
Electoral Act
Section 106
of the same Act
provides that:
“(1) The Court is to be guided by good conscience and the substantial
merits of each case without regard to legal forms or technicalities.
(2) The Court is not bound by the rules of evidence.”
Bleby J, with whose judgment Mullighan J agreed, said, in relation to
“The court is obliged to act judicially, to apply the requirements of
the Act and the common law and to afford all parties and
legitimate interveners
the principles of natural justice. However, the common law criteria which I
consider are applicable, as well
as the requirements of
require a judgment to be made about whether there has been an election at all,
whether the statutory electoral procedures have been
so abused that there has
been no election and whether, in the circumstances stated in
the result of the election was affected by the relevant defect or
irregularity. Without the provisions of
, some might take the view that the
only way of reaching a conclusion on those requirements is to hear evidence from
every relevant
elector as to their inability to vote, how they would have voted,
how they in fact voted or, if the relevant circumstances had been
different, how
they would have voted. It might be said that at least a sufficient number of
such people would have to give evidence
in order to reach such a conclusion.
Section 106
avoids the need for any such requirement. It means, in the
context of this Act, that the Court must exercise its judgment according
good conscience and according to what it considers to be the substantial merits
of the case as to whether the respective common
law or statutory criteria have
been met. It permits resort to a common sense judgment in all the
circumstances.
However, the court's judgment cannot be merely arbitrary. It
must still apply the common law principles. In the case of
it must apply the well known standard of being satisfied on the balance of
probabilities that the result of the election was affected
by the defect,
irregularity or defamation as the case may be. The section therefore has a
useful function, but it does not, as was
suggested in the course of the
petitioner's argument, allow the court to create new
(emphasis in
original) (citations omitted)
[22] Similarly, in the context of the Act, the Court must act
as set out in
Land Court Act 2000
. However, there is no basis to
conclude that in reaching its decision, the Land Court did otherwise.
Accordingly, this contention
does not assist the appellants.
[23] Second, the
appellants rely on a passage in Ivan v
Valuer-General
“[7] The levelling of the subject land has been carried out in such a
way that not all of the land is useable. Mr Ivan also
notes that in response to
his Right to Information request the sales disclosed by the Valuer-General as
being used to value his land
are different to what is now being relied upon. As
vexing as this may be, when the matter comes before this Court the respondent
entitled to make the case it chooses to make and is not bound by any past basis
it may have relied upon. Equally, the appellant
is free to base the appeal on
other evidence to what he might have chosen to put forward at, for instance, an
objection conference.”
[24] The appellants seek to draw from this a rule of general
application; in effect that they could rely in the Land Court on a claim
made previously. However, that passage is not authority for that proposition.
What was being referred to in that passage was
the sales provided as the basis
of arriving at the value for the land. The passage was not considering the more
fundamental issue
of whether there had been a decision at all.
[25] Equally,
the contention in paragraph 19 of the grounds of appeal, that the respondent did
in fact decide on the objection, is
of no assistance. It is uncontentious that
the respondent made a decision on objection. The respondent did not, however,
make a decision
on a site improvement determination as it did not form part of
the objection.
[26] Third, the appellants submit that s 172(1) of the Act,
which provides that this appeal must be by way of a rehearing, will allow
Court to, for instance, permit the appellants to amend their appeal under r 375
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999
to “...add the new cause of
action of a site improvement deduction
[27] However,
of the Act specifically sets out permitted amendments to
an objection, none of which are of assistance to the appellants.
[28] Further,
Land Court Act 2000
provides that the appeal is
required to be decided on the record from the Land Court, subject to the
limited, and presently inapplicable,
scope for new evidence provided by sub-s
[29] A deduction for site improvement costs, accordingly, is not able to
be considered in this appeal. Equally, it was not able to
be considered in the
Land Court.
[30] This conclusion is consistent with the scheme of the Act.
Sections 38
of the Act allow the owner of the land to apply to
the Valuer-General for a deduction for site improvements made by them in the
Section 41(1)
provides that a “deduction application” may
be made as a ground for an objection to a valuation or at any other time.
former, it must be done as provided for in s 113. In the latter case, at any
other time, it must be done using the approved
[33] Section 113(2)
makes provision for particular requirements to be met when the objection ground
is a deduction application or
deduction application,
provides that the Valuer-General must consider it
and either refuse it or grant it in whole or in part.
[34] Here, the
deduction application was not included in the objection. The objection form, at
page 122 of the record, under the heading
“Application for Site
Improvement Deduction”, has the words “Not Applicable” typed
[35] Notwithstanding that specific statement, the appellants contended
that a decision of the High Court of Australia in Re Coldham;
Ex parte Brideson
supports the consideration of matters not ruled upon in the decision on
[36] However, in that case, the issue was whether, on an appeal from
a decision of the Registrar, the Australian Industrial Relations
Commission had
Registrar’s decision. As a matter
of statutory interpretation, that
question was answered in the affirmative. As has been explained, the applicable
legislation requires
a different conclusion in the present case.
appellants also referred to Wakefield & Ors v Commissioner of State
In that case, Bowskill J said:
“[17] In the present context, as can be seen from ss 65-68 of the
Taxation Administration Act, the process adopted by the Commissioner
in making a
decision in relation to an objection by a taxpayer does not involve what would
normally be described as a hearing (including,
for example, hearing evidence and
oral argument). This affects the meaning to be given to a
“rehearing”, where a right
of appeal to a court is conferred.
[18] It is for that reason that it has been held that where a right of
appeal is given to a court from a decision of an administrative
authority, a
provision that the appeal is to be by way of rehearing generally means that the
court will undertake a hearing de novo,
although there is no absolute rule to
this effect. Once again, it depends on the terms of the
legislation”
[38] As her Honour made clear, the content of the rehearing
depends on the terms of the legislation. In the present case,
Court Act 2000
is the relevant provision. It does not assist the appellants, for
the reasons previously discussed.
[39] In support of the contention that once
the appeal was before the Land Court, the matter of a deduction for site
improvements
could have been raised, the appellants also referred to a passage
in a case concerning shopping centre
valuations.
The passage relied upon
is to the effect
that the owner’s agent had failed to apply for a deduction for site works.
The Court accepted that the valuation
was wrong. It was submitted that the
situation here was such that a similar approach should be taken. However, the
preceding paragraph,
[64], records that the Court was referring to batter banks
and lost area. Although the words “site works” were used,
meaning and context of the expression in that case was not the same as a site
improvement as that expression is used in
[40] Reference was also made to observations of Kirby J in Allesch v
Honour, while agreeing with the majority on the disposition of the case,
referred to the necessity of providing an opportunity
to be heard. However,
these observations do not assist as the appellants were provided with an
opportunity to be heard on the objection
before the Court. There was no
requirement to hear them in relation to a subject which they specifically stated
in their objection
form was “Not
Applicable”.
[41] Finally, the
appellants submit that the respondent should have been aware that they were
entitled to make a deduction application
and ought to have brought this to their
attention. However, the respondent is not required to provide advice to the
appellants as
to how they might choose to act. That is a matter for them.
[42] These conclusions render it strictly unnecessary to consider further,
two conclusions raised by the respondent as to why any
appeal was futile in any
event. However, as they were argued, the Court will briefly state its
conclusions as to those contentions.
Section 43(2)
requires that a
deduction for site improvement costs be deducted from the “relevant
and subsequent valuations as
prescribed.
Section 43(5)
specifically defines “relevant valuation” in the following
(5) In this section—
relevant valuation
(a) if the deduction application was made as an objection ground—the
valuation objected to; or
(b) otherwise—the valuation for which a valuation notice is next to be
given to the owner.
[45] In the present case, (b) would be applicable. Accordingly,
even if a deduction for site improvement costs were to be agitated
in this case
and allowed, it would make no difference whatever to the valuation as at 1
October 2019.
[46] Further, ss 143 to 145 provide a specific code for
amending objections. None of the permitted amendments would extend to the
deduction for site improvement costs.
[47] Relevantly, section 143(2)
If an objector purports to amend an objection other than under this part, the
valuer-general must disregard the purported amendment
when deciding the
[48] Under s 145, permitted amendments may be made to reflect
an additional matter or include further information, but that is expressly
limited to matters being dealt with under
, which comprises ss 132 to 142 of
the Act. None of these sections have any application to the present
[49] Accordingly, the Act does not permit the amendment of the
objection to include the application for a deduction for site improvement
[50] This conclusion is not altered by a construction of either s 157 or s
169 of the Act.
[51] Section 157(3)(c) of the Act, which provides that if a
site improvement deduction is claimed, that must be stated in the valuation
appeal notice, does no more than say what must be in the notice. It does not
create separate rights or jurisdiction.
[52] The requirement in s 169(2) that
the appeal must be by way of a rehearing similarly does not extend the scope of
the appeal.
[53] The Land Court correctly held that the appeal should be
struck out. The appeal must be dismissed.
[54] Both parties submitted that each should bear their own
Section 57A(3)
Land Court Act 2000
provides that this will be the
result if this Court makes no order relating to costs. Accordingly, no order is
