Aboriginal Customary Laws: Final Report
Aboriginal Customary Laws: Final Report
Law Reform Commission of Western Australia
September 2006
This Final Report is intended to be read in conjunction with the
Commission’s earlier Discussion Paper which provides greater
respect of the Commission’s initial consultation findings, its research
and analysis.
Departing somewhat from the Discussion Paper structure, the first four
chapters of the Final Report are of a general nature. Chapter
One addresses some
of the misconceptions about the reference, and about Aboriginal customary law
generally, that have featured in
media debates since the release of the
Commission’s Discussion Paper; Chapter Two outlines some guiding
principles for reform
that are applicable across all areas of the reference;
Chapter Three summarises issues raised in the Discussion Paper about the state
of Aboriginal disadvantage in Western Australia and the Commission’s
consultation findings; and Chapter Four discusses methods
of and barriers to
recognition of Aboriginal customary laws in this state.
These chapters are followed by specific chapters which address the
interaction between Aboriginal law and culture and Western Australian
defined areas: Chapter Five deals with the criminal justice system; Chapter Six
with the civil law system; Chapter Seven with
family law and family violence;
Chapter Eight with customary harvesting of natural resources; Chapter Nine with
evidence and court
procedure; and Chapter Ten with Aboriginal community
governance in Western Australia.
The Commission’s final recommendations to Parliament follow a brief
discussion of the issues within each section and also feature
in Appendix A to
this Report. Where submissions received overwhelmingly supported the
Commission’s original proposals, discussion
of the issues is limited.
Those wishing to read a more detailed explanation of the arguments or research
supporting the Commission’s
conclusions may do so by turning to the page
of the Discussion Paper indicated in accompanying footnotes. Where submissions
disputed the Commission’s original proposals, where new research has
come to light or where new issues have arisen, a more
detailed explanation for
the Commission’s final recommendations or findings is provided.
For the purposes of assisting the Western Australian government in the timely
implementation of the 131 recommendations contained
in this Final Report, the
Commission has identified departmental and/or agency responsibility for the
implementation of each recommendation.
This important information is
in Appendix B to this Report.
