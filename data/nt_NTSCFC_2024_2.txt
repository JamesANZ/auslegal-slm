CORAM: GRANT CJ, KELLY and BARR JJ
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
(Delivered 27 September 2024)
Plaintiff is a former member of the Northern Territory Police Force. He has
filed an Originating Motion in the Supreme Court
seeking an order quashing a
decision made by the Inability Appeal Board on 25 July 2022 disallowing an
appeal from a finding that
he was not fit to discharge, suited to perform or
capable of efficiently performing the duties of a police officer; and a decision
subsequently made by the Commissioner of Police on 11 August 2022 retiring
the Plaintiff from the Northern Territory Police Force.
The Originating Motion
also seeks a declaration that those two decisions, and two precursor decisions,
were beyond the powers conferred
Administration Act 1978
Referral to the Full Court
[2] The trial
judge in this matter has referred the following questions of law to the Full
Court pursuant to
Supreme Court Act 1979
the Commissioner of Police (“the Commissioner”), or a prescribed
member has formed, or could reasonably form, the
opinion that a member is
“unable to efficiently or satisfactorily perform the member’s
duties” because of a physical
or mental condition (“medical
incapacity”) within the meaning of
of the PAA, may the
Commissioner exercise the power under
by reason of that medical incapacity to “advise the member in writing that
the Commissioner intends to retire the
member from the Police Force”?
the answer to question 1 is “yes”, is the exercise of the power by
the Commissioner to take action under
conditioned
by an obligation to consider the financial consequences for the member described
and/or the taking of “steps” to facilitate the
member returning to duties in
of the PAA?
the answer to question 1 is “yes”, in forming an
“opinion” for the purposes of
basis of a “physical or mental condition”, does the expression in
the “duties the member was employed to perform” refer
to all duties of a police officer that a member might be directed
Agreed facts
following facts have been agreed between the parties for the purpose of this
(a) The Plaintiff became a member of the Northern Territory Police Force
(“NTPF”) in 1988 and, as at 11 August 2022,
he held the rank of
Senior Sergeant.
(b) With effect from 12 August 2022, the Plaintiff was retired under
of the PAA by the Commissioner.
(c) The Plaintiff was exposed to a number of traumas both prior to and during
his time working as a member of the NTPF. Many of
the traumas were
work-related, and others were not.
(d) During his period of continuous employment, the Plaintiff was absent from
duty for the following significant periods due to his
mental health: in 2005 for
approximately nine months; in 2008 and 2009 for approximately 14 months;
between October 2010 and April
2011; and from early 2016 to June 2017. There
was a brief attempted return to work in June 2017, following which the Plaintiff
absent through to his retirement date on 11 August 2022.
(e) On 5 September 2017, the Plaintiff made a claim for workers compensation
(NT) on the basis of a “mental
condition”, being a chronic post-traumatic stress disorder
claim was accepted. He was then certified to be unfit for duties.
(f) The Plaintiff’s General Practitioner certified the Plaintiff as fit
for non-operational duties with restricted hours as
at 17 August 2020, and fit
to resume non-operational duties on a full-time basis as at 7 December
2020. The medical opinions underpinning
the certification were disputed by the
Commissioner.
Process under
and VI of the PAA
(g) On 22 July 2019, a prescribed member formed the opinion that the Plaintiff
“was unable to efficiently or satisfactorily
perform the member’s
duties because of a mental condition” within the meaning of
of the PAA. Principally, this opinion was based on a report dated 1 July
2019 by Dr Little, a consultant psychiatrist.
(h) The prescribed member gave a direction to the Plaintiff pursuant to
of the PAA to submit to an examination by a health
practitioner.
(i) An examination of the Plaintiff was then conducted on 13 August 2019 with
consultant psychiatrist, Dr Hundertmark. Dr Hundertmark
provided a report to
the Commissioner of 22 August 2019. Dr Little provided a responding report of
16 September 2019 to Dr Hundertmark’s
report. Dr Hundertmark provided a
further report of 9 October 2019 in reply.
(j) On 31 December 2019, the prescribed member reported to the Commissioner, who
formed the opinion on the basis of those reports
and the other information
available to him that the Plaintiff was not “totally and permanently
incapacitated”, but assessed
the member to be “unable to perform
(his) duties efficiently or satisfactorily because of a physical or
psychological condition”.
(k) Further, the Commissioner having formed the opinion that the member was
“not fit to discharge, suited to perform or capable
of efficiently
performing, the duties the member is employed to perform” in purported
exercise of the power in
of the PAA so advised the member by written
Notice (“the
Notice”) (“the First Decision”)
and invited his response.
(l) On 10 January and 16 January 2020, the Plaintiff’s legal
representatives wrote responding to the
(m) On 20 January 2020, a memorandum was provided to the Acting Commissioner of
Police, Michael White, informing him of the Plaintiff’s
explanation, and
that, if he was not satisfied with the Plaintiff’s explanation, he should
arrange for a review to be carried
out to determine whether his opinion formed
of the PAA was well founded. Annexed to this Notice of Case
Stated and marked “C” is that
memorandum.
(n) On 23 January 2020, Acting Commissioner White wrote to the Plaintiff and
advised that he was not satisfied with the explanation
provided by the Plaintiff
and, in accordance with
of the PAA, arranged for a review to be
undertaken pursuant to
of the PAA by Assistant Commissioner
Anticich to determine whether his opinion was well
(o) On 20 February 2020, Assistant Commissioner Anticich advised the Plaintiff
that he had completed his review and concluded that
the opinion of the
Commissioner, that the Plaintiff is not fit to discharge, suited to perform or
capable of efficiently performing
the duties he is employed to perform, was well
(p) On 1 May 2020, the Commissioner gave notice that he intended to retire the
Plaintiff from the NTPF, pursuant to
of the PAA (“the
Notice”) (“the Second
Decision”).
The appeal to the Inability Appeal Board
(q) On 15 May 2020, the Plaintiff appealed the Second Decision to the Inability
Appeal Board (“the Board”).
(r) Additional evidence in the form of further medical reports, documents and
oral testimony was received by the Board on the hearing
of the Appeal, which
proceeded as a hearing
. Conflicting views are expressed in the
expert evidence as to whether the Plaintiff is capable of performing duties of a
officer, whether wholly or partly in the sense of performing restricted
or non-operational duties.
(s) On 25 July 2022, the Board disallowed the appeal of the Plaintiff pursuant
to s 94(6) of the PAA and (
) found that the Plaintiff was
not fit to discharge, suited to perform or capable of efficiently performing the
duties that he was
employed to perform (“the Third
Decision”).
(t) On 11 August 2022, the Commissioner retired the Plaintiff from the NTPF with
effect on 12 August 2022, in the purported exercise
of the power in
of the PAA (“the Fourth Decision”).
(u) On 25 September 2022, the Plaintiff commenced judicial review proceedings by
Originating Motion in the Northern Territory Supreme
Court seeking relief,
including declarations, from the First, Second, Third and Fourth Decision.
The operation of the statutory scheme
Sections 87
of the PAA, which are the primary focus of this reference, all fall
of the PAA, which is titled “Inability of member to
discharge duties”.
of the PAA relevantly provides that where the Commissioner is of the opinion
that a member “is not fit to discharge, suited
to perform or capable of
efficiently performing, the duties the member is employed to perform”, the
Commissioner shall advise
the member in writing of that opinion and the grounds
on which it is formed, and invite the member to indicate in writing whether
or she agrees with the opinion or to explain in writing any matter referred to
in the notice.
of the PAA provides that if the Commissioner is not satisfied with the
member’s explanation (or if none is provided), the Commissioner
arrange for a review to be carried out by one or more members to determine
whether the opinion is well founded. The reviewing
member(s) are required to
advise the Commissioner and the subject member in writing of their findings as a
result of the review.
In the course of that review process, the reviewing
member(s) may direct the subject member to submit to examination by one or more
health practitioners if that is relevant to the review. Where a direction in
those terms is given, the subject member may also be
examined by a health
practitioner of his or her own choice and submit the report of that examination
to the reviewing member(s).
If the subject member refuses to comply with a
direction to submit to medical examination, the reviewing member(s) shall notify
the Commissioner of the refusal, and the Commissioner shall take such action
under the PAA (other than dismissal) as the Commissioner
thinks fit.
of the PAA provides that if the member has initially agreed with the
Commissioner’s opinion, or if following the review process
Commissioner remains of the same opinion on the same grounds, or on different
grounds revealed by the review, the Commissioner
may take either “no
action” or a number of specified actions. Those specified actions include
directing the member to
take leave; standing the member down on full salary on
compassionate grounds for a period not exceeding three months; transferring
member to other duties, including duties of a lower rank and salary; or advising
the member in writing that the Commissioner
intends to retire the member from
the Police Force.
of the PAA relevantly provides that at any time after a notice has been served
, the Commissioner may, pending the completion of the process
including any appeal, stand the member down for a period not exceeding
months, including extending the period for successive three-month terms; direct
the member to take leave; or transfer the member
to other duties, including
duties of a lower rank and salary. The Commissioner is expressly empowered to
take any one or more of
those actions, to have effect either concurrently or
sequentially.
[9] Although it
would appear from those provisions that a member’s fitness and capability
to perform duties may involve a consideration
of medical issues,
the PAA deals specifically with what its title describes as “Medical
incapacity”.
Subsection 91(1)
provides that a member “shall be
taken to be totally and permanently incapacitated ... if, because of a physical
condition, it is unlikely that the member will ever be able to work in
any employment or hold any office for which the member is
reasonably qualified
by education, training or experience or could become reasonably qualified after
retraining”.
the PAA goes on to provide that where the Commissioner or a “prescribed
is of the opinion
that a member “is unable to efficiently or satisfactorily perform the
member’s duties because of a
physical or mental condition”, the
Commissioner or prescribed member may direct the member to submit to an
examination by one
or more health practitioners. As in
of the PAA,
where a direction in those terms is given, the member may also be examined by a
health practitioner of his or her own
choice and submit the report of that
examination to the Commissioner or prescribed member. After considering the
results of those
examinations, and all other relevant information available to
the Commissioner or prescribed member, the Commissioner may determine
the member is “totally and permanently incapacitated”. Where the
process has been undertaken by a prescribed
member, that prescribed member is
required to report the findings of the examinations to the Commissioner for the
purpose of allowing
the Commissioner to make a determination.
of the PAA goes on to provide that where the Commissioner determines
“that a member is totally and permanently incapacitated,
the Commissioner
may, after considering the provisions of any superannuation legislation applying
to the member, retire the member
from the Police Force on the grounds of
invalidity or take such action under [Part V] as the Commissioner thinks
appropriate”.
Section 91(6)
of the PAA provides that where the
Commissioner does not determine that the member is totally and permanently
incapacitated, but
assesses the member to be unable to perform “the
member’s duties efficiently or satisfactorily because of a physical
mental condition”, the Commissioner “shall take whatever steps he
considers reasonable and practicable to facilitate
the member resuming those
duties or take such other action under [Part V] as the Commissioner thinks
appropriate”.
the PAA confers and governs rights of appeal, including inability and
disciplinary appeals. Section 94 of the PAA relevantly
provides that a member
aggrieved by a direction, action or intention under
by or of the
Commissioner, including a decision or opinion as a result of which such an
action was taken, direction given or intention
made, may appeal to an Inability
Appeal Board against the direction, action or intention. In determining that
appeal, the Inability
Appeal Board may disallow the appeal or allow the appeal
in whole or part and direct the Commissioner to take such action under
of the PAA as the Appeal Board considers necessary.
Exercise of
powers in case of “medical incapacity”
[13] Against
that factual and statutory background, the first question of law referred is
whether, in circumstances where the Commissioner
or a prescribed member has
formed, or could reasonably form, the opinion that a member is “unable to
efficiently or satisfactorily
perform the members duties because of a physical
or mental condition” within the meaning of
of the PAA, the
Commissioner may initiate an enquiry into fitness, suitability and capability
of the PAA, and subsequently retire the member under
of the PAA on the basis of that medical incapacity.
Plaintiff contends that question should be answered in the negative. In making
that contention, the Plaintiff seeks to characterise
the process which occurred
(as set out in the agreed facts) as follows:
The process which led
to the Plaintiff’s retirement on the basis of his medical incapacity was
pursued initially under
of the PAA, but abandoned when the
pre-conditions in
to the exercise of the power to retire on the
grounds of invalidity were not met.
[15] That is not
a complete or accurate characterisation of what occurred. Rather, when the
Commissioner determined that the Plaintiff
was not totally and permanently
incapacitated, and that the procedure under
was accordingly not
available, he proceeded in accordance with
as the appropriate
course to follow.
[16] Having
assessed that the Plaintiff was unable to perform his duties efficiently or
satisfactorily because of a physical or mental
condition, the Commissioner was
empowered under
to “take such other action under [Part V] as
Commissioner
thinks appropriate”. As already described,
of the PAA consists
inclusive. The giving of notice under
the Commissioner did in this case, was on the basis that it was “other
action” under
within the meaning of
of the PAA. That
the Commissioner was following that course is apparent from the fact that the
notice of inability to discharge
duties dated 31 December 2019:
(a) made reference to the fact that the Plaintiff had been examined by Dr
Hundertmark pursuant to
of the PAA, and Dr Hundertmark’s
opinion that the Plaintiff was able to return to restricted duties which did not
involve “frontline
activities”;
(b) recorded the opinion of the Plaintiff’s treating psychiatrist that the
repeated deteriorations in the Plaintiff’s
mental health had been most
often precipitated by “events surrounding various NT police
matters”, and that placing the
Plaintiff in a “non-operational
position” would not alleviate that risk;
(c) recorded Dr Hundertmark’s opinion in response that the Plaintiff was
fit for a return to duties in the police force, but
not frontline duties where
he would have to have contact with the general public or undertake direct
policing duties in the community;
(d) recorded the requirement in
of the PAA to consider the results
of those examinations and all other relevant information in order to determine
whether the Plaintiff
was totally and permanently incapacitated;
(e) recorded that having considered the medical reports, the Commissioner had
determined that the Plaintiff was not totally and permanently
incapacitated, and
assessed further pursuant to
of the PAA that the Plaintiff was
unable to perform his duties efficiently or satisfactorily because of a physical
or psychological
condition; and
(f) expressed the opinion pursuant to
of the PAA, formed on the basis
of those reports, that the Plaintiff was not fit to discharge, suited to perform
or capable of efficiently
discharging the duties he was employed to perform.
question whether the Commissioner was precluded from initiating an enquiry under
of the PAA, and subsequently retiring the member under
of the PAA, is one of statutory construction. In
Alcan (NT) Alumina v
Commissioner of Territory Revenue
, the plurality stated:
Court has stated on many occasions that the task of statutory construction must
begin with a consideration of the text itself.
Historical considerations and
extrinsic materials cannot be relied on to displace the clear meaning of the
text. The language which
has actually been employed in the text that
legislation is the surest guide to legislative
[18] The text of
of the PAA provides expressly that, in an enquiry into medical incapacity
, if the Commissioner does not find that the member is totally
and permanently incapacitated but assesses the member to be unable
the member's duties efficiently or satisfactorily because of a physical or
mental condition, the Commissioner may “take
such other action under this
Part as the Commissioner thinks appropriate”. On a plain reading of the
provision, one of the
options authorised by the text of
exercise the power under
of the PAA by reason of that medical
inability to advise the member in writing of that opinion and to invite a
response. If it is
accepted that course was permissible and valid under the
legislative scheme, a plain and natural reading of the provisions would
support the construction that retirement under
of the PAA was also
available, subject to the satisfaction of the statutory preconditions.
construction which the Plaintiff urges relies in the main upon the assertion
that the powers in
of the PAA do not apply to medical
incapacity. That assertion is inconsistent on its face with the statutory
direction in
, after the Commissioner has formed a view that the
member in question has an inability referable to a physical or mental condition,
to “other action” under
In context, the reference to
“other action” would plainly seem to be a reference to action under
. The Plaintiff’s assertion is also inconsistent with the
express contemplation of examination by a health practitioner in
the PAA, and the requirement on the part of the reviewing member(s) to take any
report of such an examination into account in
reaching the findings concerning
the grounds under
of the PAA.
Plaintiff seeks to address those textual considerations with the contention that
the word “action” which appears
particular meaning in
of the Act which does not extend to an
administrative step such as the issue of a notice under
provision of advice of an intention to retire under
Plaintiff’s contention is that the word “action” in
(6) must be taken to mean either “no action” or
the actions in
, (b) and (c) only; and that it cannot be taken to
refer back to
so as to authorise the issue of a fresh notice under
that section. This is said to be because the conception and meaning of
under the PAA is the ultimate exercise of compulsory power
by the Commissioner on the terms and conditions of employment of a member.
Plaintiff relies in this respect on s 94 of the PAA, which confers rights
of appeal against particular types of “action”
by the Commissioner
or a member or prescribed member. Section 94 relevantly
Inability or disciplinary appeals
(1) A member aggrieved by:
(a) the action of the Commissioner under
(b) the action under section 84E(3) by a member; or
(c) the action under
section 81(2)(d)
or 84D by the Commissioner or a
prescribed member; or
(ca) a direction of the Commissioner under section 84G that the member not be
paid salary during the period of the member’s
suspension under section 76A
(d) a direction, action or intention under
by or of the Commissioner;
(e) a decision or opinion as a result of which such an action was taken,
direction given or intention made,
may, within 14 days after being notified of the action, direction or
intention (or, in a case referred to in paragraph (b), within
14 days after
being notified of the action taken as a result of a review under section
84E(3)), and in the prescribed manner and
(f) in the case of an action referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or a
decision or opinion relating to such action – appeal
to a Disciplinary
Appeal Board against the action; or
(fa) in the case of a direction referred to in paragraph (ca) – appeal to
a Disciplinary Appeal Board against the direction;
(g) in the case of a direction, action or intention referred to in paragraph (d)
or a decision or opinion relating to such direction,
action or intention –
appeal to an Inability Appeal Board against direction, action or intention.
Plaintiff says that the distinction drawn between “direction”,
“action”, “intention”,
“decision” and
“opinion” in this provision evinces an intention on the part of the
legislature that the term
“action” has a specific and restricted
meaning, not only in
but also in the other parts of the PAA. That
construction is said to receive support from the fact that the paragraph of
specifically confers the right of appeal in relation to
does so by the formulation “direction, action or
intention”, which reflects that
is concerned with a
“direction” to take leave and
is concerned with an
“intention” to retire, while the other two paragraphs within that
section contemplate “action”
in the form of standing down and
assumption that words are used consistently in a piece of legislation is readily
rebuttable in circumstances where the terms
of the statute suggest that the one
word (and its grammatical parts) may have a different operation in different
parts of the statute.
That is particularly so where the assumption is applied
to compel something other than the ordinary meaning of a word to be placed
it. There will be cases in which it is apparent from the different contexts in
which a word appears that it will have different
meanings. In this case, there
is good reason for concluding that the phrase “such other action under
this Part” appearing
of the PAA is not confined by the
distinctions drawn in s 94.
s 94(6) clearly uses the term “such action” to refer to any of
the processes which might be adopted by the Commissioner
including retirement. The better view is that the formulations
“direction, action or intention” and “decision
opinion” are used in those provisions conferring rights of appeal in order
to obviate arid definitional arguments concerning
amenability to appeal, rather
than to limit the meaning of the term “action” appearing elsewhere
in the legislation for
different purposes.
it is artificial to seek to draw distinctions between an intention to retire a
member under
of the PAA on the one hand, and the exercise of a
compulsory power under a member’s terms of employment on the other hand,
and thereby to characterise retirement as something other than
“action” under
It is apparent from the definition of
“retire” in
of the PAA that it constitutes a termination of
the employment of a member under the terms of the statute otherwise than by
That can be nothing other than the exercise of a compulsory power
under the statutory conditions of a member’s employment.
The formation of
an opinion and the issue of notice under
of the PAA is simply a
precursor to the exercise of that power.
the term “action” is used with varying meanings throughout the PAA,
including the exercise of powers under

(ss 145(12)

usage demonstrates that the meaning of the term will and does vary throughout

purported adoption of that course would be precluded by the administrative law
requirement that statutory powers

Conversely, the operation of

Plaintiff’s analysis also invokes the principle of construction expressed
Anthony Hordern and Sons v Amalgamated Clothing and Allied Trades Union of
in the following terms.
When the Legislature
explicitly gives a power by a particular provision which prescribes the mode in
which it shall be exercised and
the conditions and restrictions which must be
observed, it excludes the operation of general expressions in the same
instrument which
might otherwise have been relied upon for the same
principle was subsequently restated in
by Dixon J (as his
Honour then was) in these terms:
[A]n enactment in affirmative words
appointing a course to be followed usually may be understood as importing a
negative, namely,
that the same subject matter is not to be done according to
some other course.
rationale underlying the principle is to ensure that where the legislature
confers a specific power subject to limitations
on its exercise, the holder of
the power cannot resort to a general power in order to avoid or otherwise thwart
those limitations.
The Plaintiff contends that this principle applies to the
operation of
of the PAA, by characterising
as the provision
dealing with a member’s inability to efficiently or satisfactorily perform
his or her duties referable specifically
to a physical or mental condition, and
as provisions dealing generally with a member’s
inability to efficiently or satisfactorily perform his or her duties. In
written submissions, the Plaintiff says.
As the description of these
statutory processes show, the opinions necessary to initiate the exercise of the
(“the member is unable to efficiently or satisfactorily
perform the member's duties
because of a physical or mental
”) is a more specific subset of the general circumstances
necessary to form an opinion for the purposes of
(“is not fit to
discharge, suited to perform or capable of efficiently performing, the duties
the member is employed to perform”).
While each are concerned with the duties the member is employed to perform
and with the member’s inability to efficiently or
satisfactorily perform
those duties, the relevant difference is the
of the inability.
is concerned solely with the particular case which it summarises
in the heading as “
medical incapacity
” and which means
“because of a physical or mental condition”.
inability to perform duties that includes matters of attitude, disposition,
competence, ability, or where there is no
apparent explanation for
non-performance of duties.
[31] While there
is no doubt as to the existence of the principle, the Plaintiff’s
characterisation of
as the specific provision subject to express
limitations, and
as general provisions, does not lead to the
conclusion that
cannot be used in any case of incapacity for
medical reasons. The only relevant limitations on the exercise of the power
are that where the Commissioner determines the member to
be totally and permanently incapacitated the actions which may be taken
prescribed in
, and where the Commissioner determines that the
member is not totally and permanently incapacitated the actions which may be

including through the s 91(6) pathway, with the exception of action which
may have some
disadvantageous impact on a member’s entitlement to benefits

construction
appearing from the text of the provisions in Part V of the PAA. While it may be
accepted that the text must be construed
in context, as opposed to divorced from
there is also nothing in the
context which demands that result. At base, this is an argument that the proper
construction of the
legislation is governed by the consequences for the
Plaintiff rather than the plain and natural meaning of the text. That
interpretive
approach is legitimate only where the alternative would yield an
objectively inappropriate result and be plainly inconsistent with
legislative intention. This is not a matter where the literal interpretation
would create an unsatisfactory and unintended regime,
and no alternative
interpretation is available without what is sometimes described as
“grammatical surgery”.
negative implication asserted by the Plaintiff requires the words “such

thinks appropriate”

perhaps more specifically, “other

materials to suggest that the text does not accurately conform to

intentions of the drafter and the legislature; and nor is this a case in which
the inadvertent use or omission of
words by the legislature makes it patently
necessary to read words into the legislation in order to achieve the purpose of
addition, the construction pressed by the Plaintiff would not advance the
purpose of the provisions. The Plaintiff’s
assertion is, in essence, that
the requirement to consider the provisions of superannuation legislation on
retirement for total and
permanent incapacity impliedly excludes retirement for
any other medical reason because there is no requirement under s 89(d) of
the PAA to consider the impact of that action on a member’s entitlement to
benefits under superannuation legislation. There
is a good reason why the
obligation on the Commissioner to consider the provisions of any superannuation
legislation applying to
appears in s 91(5) of the PAA, and not in s 91(6). That reason is
directed to the proper administration of the Northern Territory
Government and
Public Authorities’ Superannuation Scheme and the Northern Territory
Government Death and Invalidity Scheme,
rather than to the member’s
Commissioner’s facility to retire a member under s 91(5) of the PAA
on the “grounds of invalidity” after

Superannuation Act 1986

Notwithstanding any other law in force in the

Superannuation] the Commissioner’s approval in writing to the
retirement.
reference to “either Scheme” includes both the Northern Territory
Government and Public Authorities’ Superannuation
Scheme and the Northern
Territory Government Death and Invalidity Scheme. The Scheme to which an
employee belongs will depend upon
whether the employment commenced before or
after 9 August 1999, but under either Scheme a member may not be retired on the
of invalidity unless his or her employer, which in this case and for
these purposes is the Commissioner of Police, has obtained the
approval of the
Commissioner of Superannuation. The clear purpose of that provision is to
protect the Schemes from depletion by
the payment of invalidity retirement
benefits other than in appropriate circumstances, and by a failure to pursue any
recovery which
may be available from other entitlements.
particular, the approval mechanism allows the Commissioner of Superannuation to
be satisfied on the relevant medical and other
evidence that the member is
physically or mentally incapacitated to such a degree as to be unfit for any
employment for which the
member is reasonably qualified by education, training
or experience, and to ensure that any entitlement to periodic payments for
of earning capacity under workers’ compensation legislation is set off
against the invalidity retirement benefit which
would otherwise be
A number of
distinctions must be drawn between the respective operations of ss 91(5)
and (6) of the PAA in these respects.
and contrary to the Plaintiff’s
submissions,
the inquiry into
total and permanent incapacity is directed to the member’s ability to work
in any employment for which the
member is reasonably qualified by education,
training or experience, rather than to the narrower question of whether the
an inability to resume police
That distinguishes the
operation of s 91(5) from the balance of
, and the reference in
s 91(5) to the Commissioner taking such other action under
Commissioner thinks appropriate is necessarily subject to a limitation arising
from the text of the provision. That is, it
is a precondition to the
Commissioner taking action that he or she has determined that the member is
totally and permanently incapacitated,
which by necessary implication precludes
action involving retirement other than on the grounds of invalidity or
transferring the
member to other duties.
there is no such limitation arising by implication from the text of
s 91(6), because action under that section is predicated on
an inability
falling short of invalidity in the sense of total and permanent incapacity.
Action under that provision, including
retirement on the grounds of an inability
to perform the duties of a police officer efficiently or satisfactorily, would
not deprive
the member in question from any continuing entitlement to periodic
payments for loss of earning capacity under workers’ compensation
legislation, or of the ability to engage in any other employment for which the
member is reasonably qualified by education, training
or experience. Moreover,
the criterion of an inability to perform “duties efficiently or
satisfactorily” appearing in
s 91(6) both replicates and references
one of the grounds on which the Commissioner may form an opinion concerning
inability under
s 87 of the PAA.
while it is correct to say that a member of the Northern Territory Government
and Public Authorities’ Superannuation Scheme
who experiences a reduction
in salary on the grounds of physical or mental incapacity may apply to the
Commissioner of Superannuation
for payment of a “continuing invalidity
income benefit”,
availability of such a benefit does not constrain the action which may be taken
under s 91(6) of the PAA, either expressly or
by necessary implication. So
much follows from: (a) the fact that s 91(6) makes no reference to a
consideration of “the provisions
of any superannuation legislation”;
(b) from the fact that such a benefit would be by definition unavailable if the
was retired under s 91(5) of the PAA, which is the provision that
does make express reference to “superannuation legislation”;
from the obvious operational imperative in a quasi-military organisation such as
a police force that a member’s continuing
performance of duties at a lower
rate of salary is governed by the Commissioner’s determination of whether
the member is able
to perform those duties efficiently or satisfactorily, rather
than the potential availability of some “top-up” income
there is no provision for a “continuing invalidity income benefit”,
or any comparable benefit, for members of the Northern
Territory Government
Death and Invalidity Scheme.
the availability of that benefit was the basis of an implication precluding
retirement under s 89(d) of the PAA for medical incapacity
falling short of
total and permanent incapacity,
would have a differential operation
dependent on whether the member’s employment commenced before or after 9
August 1999.
and contrary to the Plaintiff’s written
submissions,
the Commissioner is
not under a duty to facilitate the member resuming his or her duties. Such a
duty plainly does not and cannot
arise under the specific power to retire in
s 91(5) of the PAA. Section 91(6) provides that if a member is not
determined to be
totally and permanently incapacitated, “the Commissioner
shall take whatever steps he considers reasonable and practicable
to facilitate
the member resuming those duties
take such other action under this
Part as the Commissioner thinks appropriate”. The use of “or”
as the conjunction
expressly recognises that there is no compulsion on the
Commissioner to take steps to facilitate the member’s resumption of
duties. That is no doubt because the history and reasons underlying the
assessment of an inability to perform those duties efficiently
or satisfactorily
will in some cases militate against the adoption of that course. While it may
be accepted that the assessment
cannot be conducted on an arbitrary basis, and
that there may be concomitant obligations under the workers’ compensation
legislation,
s 91(6) of the PAA does not impose a duty or obligation on the
Commissioner to take steps to facilitate the member returning to work
instead of taking “other action” under
[46] Rather than
establishing two distinct processes with a clear “structural
separation”, on proper analysis the scheme
is an integrated
regime which deals with inability for both medical and non-medical reasons. As
the Commissioner has submitted,
there is nothing novel, unusual or necessarily
limiting about the coexistence of two processes which may in some circumstances
creates two mechanisms or pathways for dealing with inability, it also provides
expressly for the harmonious confluence of those
processes in circumstances
where an inability for medical reasons is assessed to fall short of total and
permanent incapacity. That
is the clear purpose of the formulation appearing in
s 91(6) permitting the Commissioner to “take such other action under
V] as the Commissioner thinks appropriate”. That purpose does not
deny s 87 independent and exclusive operation in relation
to inability for
other than medical reasons.
[47] One of the
reasons proffered in support of the application for the statement of a case for
consideration by the Full Court was
the suggestion of a conflict between the two
single-Judge decisions of the Supreme Court in
R v Bates; Ex parte
Commissioner
of Police v Farquhar
The plaintiff relies in particular on the following passage from
Mr Reeves submitted that s 91 was restricted to
cases of total and permanent incapacity arising on medical grounds, while
incapacity on medical grounds could be a basis for pars (a) or (b) or
(c) in s 87; however, I consider that such cases are expressly
exclusively provided for in s 91(6). I consider that s 91 is a wholly
self-contained provision instituting a procedure for dealing
with a member's
medical incapacity. Although s 86 provided that
did "not apply" to
"medical incapacity", that appears to be a drafting error, the intention
probably being that the procedure for
dealing with non-medical 'inability' in
s 87, as set out in ss 87-90, should not apply to a case of medical
incapacity, the procedure
for dealing with the latter being set out in

reached the opposite conclusion in saying:

view that, unlike the view of Kearney J, in a case where the inability of the

because of a partial incapacity, the Commissioner may nevertheless proceed under

In his written submissions, the Plaintiff contended:

, the legislative duties imposed on the Commissioner by s 91
of the PAA do not thereby confer rights on the members. In relation
Mildren J said:
It would seem that the purpose of conferring a
discretion is to require the Commissioner, or the prescribed member, as the case
be, to consider whether or not to proceed under s 91(2). If the
Commissioner or the prescribed member has failed to consider it
at all, then
administrative remedies would lie. If on the other hand, the Commissioner has
considered it but he has not considered
it properly, then the
Commissioner’s decision not to proceed by way of s 91 may be

unreasonableness
It seems to me that there is no absolute entitlement on the part of a person
who is unfortunate enough to find himself or herself
unable to efficiently or
satisfactorily perform his or her duties because of a physical or mental
condition, to require the Commissioner
[51] To that may
be added the qualification that it might appear to the Commissioner during the
course of a process commenced under
s 87 of the PAA, including on the basis
of a medical examination conducted pursuant to s 88, that there is some
reasonable ground
for apprehending that the member is totally and permanently
incapacitated. Although it is unnecessary to decide the matter for present
purposes, the formation of that opinion might require the Commissioner to
proceed thereafter under s 91 of the PAA.
consequences
[52] If the
answer to question 1 is “yes”, as we have determined, the second
question of law referred is whether the exercise
of power by the Commissioner
under ss 87 and 89 of the PAA is conditioned by an obligation to consider
the financial consequences
for the member described in s 91(5) and/or the
taking of “steps” to facilitate the member returning to duties in
of the PAA. The Plaintiff’s contention in this respect is
that if s 87 does have application to incapacity caused by a physical
mental condition, the power in ss 87 and 89 should be construed as
“limited by the additional conditions and restrictions
on retirement, and
the taking of other action, as provided for in s 91”. That resolves
to the assertion that the PAA ought
be construed such that the entitlements of a
member who has an incapacity because of a physical and mental condition ought be
irrespective
of the level of incapacity and the power to be
[53] The broader
premises and constructional arguments which underlie the Plaintiff's contention
in this respect have already been
addressed in dealing with the first question
, the requirement under s 91(5) that the
Commissioner consider the provisions of any superannuation legislation arises
the member has been assessed as totally and permanently
incapacitated. There is no such requirement, much less any corresponding
or entitlement, in circumstances where the Commissioner has determined that the
member is not totally and permanently incapacitated.
s 91(6) of the PAA does not impose a duty or obligation on the Commissioner
to take steps to facilitate the member returning to
work before or instead of
taking “other action” under
, the obligations
imposed on the Commissioner under s 91 of the PAA do not otherwise give
rise to rights and entitlements on the part
of the member concerned in the
manner and with the effect that the Plaintiff asserts.
Plaintiff's argument in this respect is based upon the principle that where
separate pieces of legislation provide for broadly
equivalent powers running in
tandem but independently of each other, the exercise of one of those powers must
be read as subject
to any relevant condition or restriction imposed in relation
to the exercise of the equivalent power. There are a number of difficulties
with the application of that principle to the present circumstances.
, to the extent that the principle relies on what was said in
Gibson v Ellis
a case which involved powers of search conferred by both summary offences
legislation and misuse of drugs legislation.
This is a case in which the powers
in question appear in the same part of a single piece of legislation, which have
a harmonious
and complementary operation for reasons already described in the
context of the first question.
, it was a minority opinion in
Gibson v Ellis
that the higher threshold for the valid exercise of the
power in the misuse of drugs legislation governed both powers. That opinion
not subsequently followed.
, there is no equivalence between the power in s 89 and the
power in either s 91(5) or s 91(6) of the PAA. For the purpose of
analysis, their respective operations are sometimes as alternatives and
sometimes as adjuncts.
Duties a member is employed to
[55] If the
answer to question 1 is “yes”, as we have determined, the third
question of law referred is whether, in forming
an “opinion” for the
purposes of s 87(a) and s 89 on the basis of a “physical or
mental condition”, the expression
in s 87(a) the “duties the
member was employed to perform” refers to all duties of a police officer
that a member might
be directed to perform. This question in its present form
was not among the issues originally referred by the trial judge to the
Court. The question is obviously directed to the findings made by the Inability
Appeal Board in the following terms:
The Board considers that the
duties the member is required to perform as it appears in s 87 should be
interpreted to mean requiring
the member to be mentally and physically ready and
capable of performing all of their statutory functions, up to and including the
application of lethal force.
The oath sworn by Police officers does not differentiate by rank or position
and nor does the PAA as it applies broad immunity and
protection from civil and
criminal liability for acts done and omitted to be done by members in good faith
in the performance of
their functions. Likewise, the PAA does not distinguish
between operational [and] non-operational duties.
In these circumstances, the Board considers that the PAA requires that Police
Officers will at all times be fit to discharge, suited
to perform and capable of
efficiently performing all of the necessary statutory duties, as opposed to
involving a question of whether
a member may be fit to discharge some form of
modified or restricted duties that may necessarily exclude the inherent
requirements
of the job.
Plaintiff had argued that “the duties the member is employed to
perform” extended to such modified or restricted
duties as the member was
able to perform, and therefore precluded the formation of an opinion of
unfitness, unsuitability or incapability
on reasonable grounds if the plaintiff
was able to perform restricted or non-operational duties. The difficulty with
the question
as it is presently framed is that it is ambiguous in the sense that
it might be taken to refer to duties the member was performing
or had been
directed to perform, or to refer to some unspecified category of duties that any
member of the police force could be
directed to perform. The first of those
scenarios is not open on the uncontested facts, and the second scenario does not
the Commissioner’s position at any stage in the proceedings. In
particular, the answer to the question as presently framed
would not necessarily
be determinative of whether the Commissioner had reasonable grounds to form a
relevant opinion under s 87(a),
or whether the Commissioner had an
obligation to transfer the Plaintiff to “other duties” under
s 89 rather than retiring
[57] Lying at
the base of the Plaintiff’s case in this respect is that
(NT) casts an obligation on the Commissioner as
employer to take reasonable steps to ensure that an injured worker is provided
employment commensurate with his or her residual capacity. The
question as presently framed does not invite a consideration of that
least not in any patent way. That difficulty was recognised by the Plaintiff
during the course of the hearing by his counsel's
suggestion that the question
be reformulated in the following terms:
Do the expressions
“the duties the member is employed to perform” in
“other duties” in
comprise any and all duties that a
member would be fit to perform, or does it include all general duties
irrespective of the effect
Commissioner’s suggested reformulation is:
Is the phrase
“the duties the member is employed to perform” in
qualified by
such that it cannot
include operational duties in circumstances where the member is unfit to perform
operational duties [by reason
of work-related injury]?
[59] The first
of these reformulated questions assumes some form of operational inconsistency
between the inability provisions of
the PAA and the employer’s obligations

member of the police force is employed to perform include the full range of
those operational duties, even allowing
for the fact that a member may at
various times be deployed on non-operational duties or in a role which does not
require the discharge
of the full range of those powers and functions. The
ambit of the phrase “the duties the member is employed to perform”
must be understood in that light.
Commissioner cannot be precluded from forming an opinion under
PAA on the basis that a member is unfit, for whatever reason, to perform the
full range of those duties. Whether that opinion
is formed on reasonable
grounds will depend upon the circumstances of the particular matter, including
the nature and duration of
the incapacity in question. The formation of that
opinion, and the action taken in consequence, does not bear on the operation of

alternative employment or retraining. However,
does not operate to compel the Commissioner to retain a person as a
sworn member of the police force where to do so would be inconsistent
operational requirements of the organisation and incompatible with the discharge
of the core functions of a police officer.
At a more specific level, the
facility for the transfer of a member to other duties under
PAA is not coextensive with or functionally related to the obligations imposed
[61] Beyond
those general observations, the issues to which this question gives rise,
including as sought to be reformulated by the
parties, are best left to be dealt
with by the trial judge according to the facts and circumstances which are found
to subsist in
the course of the application for judicial review.
Answers to referred questions
[62] For the
reasons given, the answers to the questions referred
Question 1:
Where the Commissioner of Police (the Commissioner), or a prescribed member
has formed, or could reasonably form, the opinion that
a member is “unable
to efficiently or satisfactorily perform the members duties” because of a
physical or mental condition
(“medical incapacity”) within the
Police Administration Act 1978
PAA), may the Commissioner exercise the power under
PAA by reason of that medical incapacity to “advise the member in writing
that the Commissioner intends to retire the
member from the Police
Question 2:
If the answer to question 1 is “yes”, is the exercise of the
power by the Commissioner to take action under
conditioned
by an obligation to consider the financial consequences for the member described
and/or the taking of “steps” to facilitate the member
returning to duties in
of the PAA?
Question 3:
If the answer to question 1 is “yes”, in forming an
“opinion” for the purposes of
on the basis of a
“physical or mental condition”, does the expression in
“duties the member was employed to perform” refer to all duties of a
Police officer that a member might be directed
to perform?
This question is not suitably framed for an answer on reference. At a
general level, the duties a sworn member of the police force
is employed to
perform include the full range of his or her statutory and common law powers and
functions, even allowing for the
fact that a member may at various times be
deployed on non-operational duties.
Section 75A
does not compel the Commissioner to retain a person as a sworn member of
the police force if that person is unfit, unsuited or incapable
to perform the
core functions of a police officer.
