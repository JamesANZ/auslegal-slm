This is a case note on the High Court decision in Nguyen v The Queen
(2020) 269 CLR 299.
The judgment explored the scope of the prosecution’s
duty to put its case fully and fairly. The majority held that, in order
ensure a fair trial to the accused, the prosecution has a duty to adduce all
available, cogent and admissible evidence. Alternatively,
the concurring
judgments of Nettle and Edelman JJ argued that the prosecution should be
afforded greater discretion, within the bounds
of their ongoing duty to act
fairly to the accused. Thus, while the right to a fair trial is deeply ingrained
in the Australian justice
system, the judgment in Nguyen v The Queen opens the
discussion as to what exactly constitutes a ‘fair trial’ in criminal
proceedings.
I INTRODUCTION
The relatively recent High Court judgment of
Nguyen v The
explored the scope of the
prosecution’s enduring duty to put a criminal case fully and fairly.
Specifically, the case raised
questions as to, firstly, whether
‘mixed’ statements (being a statement containing both inculpatory
and exculpatory statements)
in a recorded interview were admissible in the
Crown’s case; and secondly, whether the Crown was under a duty to tender
evidence. As will be discussed in some detail, the
majority—consisting of Kiefel CJ, Bell, Gageler, Keane and Gordon
the prosecution’s duty to put the case fully and fairly
as involving a duty to present all available, cogent and admissible
The two concurring judgments of Nettle and Edelman JJ challenged the contention
that there is some pre-existing duty to
present all available evidence, arguing
instead that the prosecution has full discretion to decide what evidence they
will adduce
at trial, within the bounds of their ever‑present duty to act
with fairness to the accused.
The right to a fair trial is at the core of our criminal justice system.
However, this 2020 judgment revealed that, in practice, there
uncertainty as to how that right is to be secured in a criminal trial: is it
enough that the prosecution is allowed complete
discretion to adduce whichever
evidence they deem necessary, limited only by their ongoing duty to act fairly
to the accused? Or
can fairness only be guaranteed by way of the prosecution
adducing all available, cogent and admissible evidence? The judgment in
Nguyen v The Queen
highlights that the precise definition of a
‘fair trial’ is perhaps not as well‑established as one may
nor the right to a fair trial as well protected. While the three
judgments ultimately reached the same conclusion, that the appeal
allowed, the minority judgments of Nettle and Edelman JJ open the door to a
discussion which is yet to be had—and
one which arguably offers far
greater flexibility to the prosecution than the decision made by the majority.
The appellant, Mr Nguyen, stood trial before a jury in the Supreme Court of
the Northern Territory, charged on indictment with offences
against the
Criminal Code Act 1983
(NT). Before answering any questions in his police
interview, the appellant was given a special caution via an interpreter, as
is not his first language. The appellant summarised his understanding of
the caution as: ‘whatever you ask and whatever I answer
will be taken as
evidence in the court’.
subsequent interview contained both inculpatory statements in the form of
admissions, and exculpatory statements, including a
claim to self-defence. In
Mr Nguyen’s first trial, the prosecution tendered the entire video
recording of the police interview.
The jury was unable to reach a verdict and a
retrial was granted. Prior to the retrial, the prosecutor advised the Court that
Crown would not tender the recorded interview for ‘tactical’
The prosecutor advised
that Mr Nguyen would not be cross‑examined on that account if the
exculpatory statements were given
in evidence and that Mr Nguyen, if he so
chose, could give evidence about the matters contained in the recorded
The retrial was stayed
while the following two questions were referred to a Full Court of the Supreme
Court of the Northern Territory:
1. Is the recorded interview admissible in the Crown case?
2. Is the Crown obliged to tender the recorded interview?
The Full Court answered ‘yes’ to question 1, and ‘no’
to question 2,
on the grounds that
the prosecution has full discretion to decide what evidence to adduce at trial,
and that there exists no general
principle that requires a prosecutor to tender
evidence of this kind.
sought to appeal this conclusion to the High Court. The High Court allowed the
appeal, finding that the recorded interview
was admissible and that the Crown
was obliged to tender it. Below is an outline of the High Court of
Australia’s consideration
of both questions.
III QUESTION 1: WAS THE RECORDED INTERVIEW ADMISSIBLE IN THE
CROWN CASE?
Only the majority discussed question 1 in detail, although the minority
judgments of Nettle and Edelman JJ did not disagree with the
response. In answering the first question, the majority made primary reference
Evidence (National Uniform Legislation) Act 2011
(NT), which provides that out-of-court statements will be exempt from the
rule against hearsay evidence if they are ‘made in
relation to an
admission at the time the admission was made, or shortly before or after that
In applying this
provision to Mr Nguyen’s case, the majority held that the exculpatory
statements Mr Nguyen made in the same
interview that contained admissions would
fall comfortably within the scope of this
Therefore, the High
Court concluded that the recorded interview was admissible in the Crown case, in
agreement with the Full Court.
As aforementioned, this finding was not contested
by either Nettle J or Edelman J in their separate judgments.
IV QUESTION 2: WAS THE CROWN OBLIGED TO TENDER THE RECORDED
The second question gave rise to contention between the majority and minority
judgments. The majority interpreted the concept of an
‘obligation’
to tender certain evidence as an aspect of the prosecution’s duty to
present the Crown’s case
fully and fairly before the
Both Nettle and Edelman JJ
agreed that the existence of this duty is uncontroversial. However, their
Honours disagreed as to the
precise extent of that duty, in particular as to
whether that duty required the prosecution to adduce all available, cogent and
Majority Judgment
In answering the first question, the majority found that the Crown was
obliged to tender the recorded interview as evidence. To substantiate
decision, the majority relied on
Mahmood v Western
, the High Court found that the prosecution is generally expected
to adduce admissible evidence of mixed statements made by an accused
in a police
so as to avoid
adverse speculation by the jury as to what the accused may have initially told
However, the majority in
went further. Kiefel CJ, Bell, Gageler, Keane and Gordon JJ
asserted that, as part of their duty to present the Crown’s case
fairly, the prosecution is required to tender ‘
cogent and admissible
unless there is
some valid reason not to do so.
The majority found that the admittedly
of the prosecution not to adduce the video record in this case was not an
example of a valid reason to refrain from adducing
the evidence. Thus, in the
absence of any valid reason to the contrary—for instance, if statements in
the evidence had been
demonstrably
—the prosecution was
bound to adduce the entirety of the admissible evidence available to them.
The conclusion of the majority is supported by
Whitehorn v The
Deane J held
that a failure by the prosecution to call a witness who
ought to be called, or to provide some ‘acceptable explanation’
not doing so, has the potential to result in an unfair trial and a miscarriage
of justice.
The prosecution has
a duty to avoid that potential for a miscarriage of justice, even before the
trial takes place. Justice Dawson
held that it is therefore possible to speak of
a prosecutor having a duty, at a point prior to trial, to call all available
as part of their function to ensure fairness to an accused
The majority in
relied on Dawson J’s judgment in
by analogy, that the prosecution holds a similar duty, prior to trial, to tender
all available evidence, unless the circumstances
provide a positive reason for
not doing so.
Consequently, the majority concluded that the prosecution had failed to
tender all admissible and available evidence, without due
reason for doing so,
and as such, they had failed to put their case fully and fairly. The majority
found that the appeal should be
allowed. The High Court ordered that the answer
given by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory to the
question be set aside, and that the question instead be answered
Concurring Judgments
The first concurring judgment, of Nettle J, agreed with the majority that the
prosecution was obliged to tender the recorded interview
but offered a different
explanation for this conclusion.
Justice Nettle agreed that the prosecution’s duty to present the
Crown’s case fully and fairly will ordinarily require
the tender of mixed
statements by the accused, so as to avoid adverse speculation by the
However, Nettle J did not
agree that the duty necessarily extends to presenting ‘all available,
cogent and admissible
referred to the decision in
Ratten v The
where the High Court
held that ‘a criminal trial is not, and does not purport to be, an
examination and assessment of
the information and evidence that
Thus, Nettle J
concluded that there is no pre-existing, prima facie duty to adduce all
available, admissible evidence. Instead, each
case must be treated as unique and
the prosecution must exercise discretion in adducing evidence that is relevant
to the individual
facts, while ensuring that the accused is treated
Any perceived unfairness
caused by the decision not to adduce particular evidence at trial may then be
examined on appeal.
Despite disagreeing with the broad precedent employed by the majority, Nettle
J agreed with the orders proposed, on the basis that
the decision not to adduce
the record of interview was likely to cause adverse jury speculation at trial
which may have given rise
to a miscarriage of
Justice Edelman also ultimately concluded that the appeal should be allowed,
but like Nettle J, disagreed with the majority in relation
to the content of the
duty owed by the prosecution. Justice Edelman contested the literary expression
of the second question. He
argued that the wording implies the existence of some
free-standing legal obligation to tender particular evidence at a point prior
trial. His Honour argued that ‘the requirements of the
[prosecution’s] duty of fairness are neither rigid nor static’,
rather are contingent on the unique circumstances and facts of each
Thus, the question is not
whether there exists a universal, pre-trial obligation for the prosecution to
tender certain evidence,
but whether the decision not to do so in a particular
case was a breach of the duty of fairness, and thus productive of a miscarriage
of justice.
Justice Edelman also argued that the question simply cannot be answered
from a perspective before the trial takes
There is no way of
knowing how the circumstances of a trial will unfold or how the particular piece
of evidence in question will
Therefore, even if the
prosecutor believes the evidence will be immaterial to the issues that are
likely to unfold, it may still
be unfair to exclude
Accordingly, Edelman J
contended that the question should not be whether the Crown is obliged to tender
the recorded interview at
a point prior to the retrial, but rather at a point
the retrial has taken place, whether, in the precise circumstances
of the trial
as it occurred
, the decision not to tender the recorded
interview resulted in
unfairness.
Nonetheless, Edelman J attempted to answer the second question by considering
the likely impacts that
have arisen if the prosecution did not tender
the record of interview, which would have required Mr Nguyen to expose
himself to cross‑examination
in order to put his account to the
Justice Edelman found
that, if that decision was maintained throughout the retrial, it was
‘extremely likely’ to result
in unfairness to the accused, due to
his ‘cultural and linguistic disadvantages that are plainly
For that reason,
Edelman J decided that the prosecution’s admittedly tactical decision not
to tender the recorded interview
was not consistent with their duty to act
fairly to the accused.
Thus, Edelman J ultimately agreed with the majority that the appeal should be
IV CONCLUSION
This case note has explained the key reasoning of each of the judgments given
. The judgments have the potential to be significant to future
discussions as to what is meant by the prosecution’s duty to
present their
case fully and fairly before the jury. The author agrees with the decisions in
the concurring judgments of Nettle and
Edelman JJ that it is problematic to
speak of a free-standing, pre‑trial obligation to tender
available, cogent and admissible evidence. Rather, the prosecution, all the
while being bound by the prima facie duty of fairness,
should be allowed a
discretion to tender such evidence as they deem necessary, the exercise of which
would be subject to review by
appellate courts.
The contention between the majority and concurring judgments in this High
Court decision reveals that, despite an accused’s
right to a fair trial
being deeply ingrained in the Australian justice system, exactly what
constitutes a ‘fair trial’
in criminal proceedings is perhaps not as
clearly defined as one may assume. The majority judgment is useful in answering
the questions
posed on this appeal. However, it is the two concurring judgments
of Nettle and Edelman JJ which open up the potential for future
conversations
regarding the prosecution’s duty of fairness and the bounds such a duty
imposes on their discretion throughout
the trial process.
