plaintiff commenced an action seeking, inter alia, damages in defamation based
on asserted publications by each defendant
which were about the plaintiff. After
the pleadings closed, the defendants applied for summary judgment or,
alternatively for the
Statement of Claim to be struck out (“
the primary
application
”). They failed on the former application but succeeded on
the latter, with liberty given to
[2] At that
time, I ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendants’ costs of and
incidental to the primary application on the standard
basis, but gave liberty to
apply on seven days’ notice given the parties had not been heard on the
issue. The plaintiff now
applies for an order that the defendants pay her costs
of the primary application. In the alternative she has submitted variously
there be no order for costs of the primary
application
or that the costs be
apportioned to reflect the respective success on the primary
application.
[3] The essence
of the plaintiff’s submissions is that the primary application involved
two distinct forms of relief. The application
for summary judgment was the
principal and more complex limb of the application, and the defendants failed
entirely on that application.
Although the defendants did succeed on the other
limb, the strike out application was the more complex and resource intensive
of the application. The defendants’ success “merely”
required the plaintiff to clarify her pleadings. It is in
essence submitted that
the overall justice of the outcome of the primary application requires that the
orders be made as sought.
The plaintiff relies on

submissions.
course of her written submissions, the plaintiff has correctly observed that the
usual rule of costs following the event
is not an absolute rule, and that the
Court has a broad discretion to make such orders as are considered appropriate.
However, that
does not mean that, in the case of mixed success on an
application, a departure from the usual rule is necessarily required.
Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd v
“... McMurdo J’s statement in
v Somerset Regional Council (No 2)
that “[o]rdinarily the fact
that a successful plaintiff or applicant fails on particular arguments does not
mean that he should
be deprived of some of its costs or require an apportionment
of costs between issues.” The same general principle was expressed
somewhat less emphatic terms by Muir JA in
Alborn v Stephens
The usual rule is that the costs of a proceeding follow the event. [Uniform

“event” is not to be determined merely by reference to the judgment
or order obtained by the plaintiff
or appellant, but is to be determined by
reference to “the events or issues, if more than one, arising in the
proceedings”.

primary reasons I observed that the two applications were “substantially
inter-twined”.
defendants’ application for summary judgment had two bases: firstly, that
the Statement of Claim alleged publication to
the plaintiff, which could not
amount to a publication at law and secondly, that communications within an
organisation, for the purposes
of the organisation, cannot amount to a
publication at law.
[7] The first
basis fell away once it was explained by Counsel for the plaintiff what was
to be conveyed by the pleading. The defendants’
application was reasonably made in light of the plain reading of the Statement
of Claim, as it then stood. The ambiguity was a reason to allow the strike out
application.
[8] True it is
that the defendants persisted with the second basis, even in light of the
explanation provided but it was, with respect,
far from the most complex of the
arguments raised. For the reasons explained in the primary reasons, it is a
proposition that does
not appear to be settled at law and, the success of the
argument will rise and fall on factual findings made. That made it an unsuitable
matter on which to grant summary judgment.
fundamental difficulty with the statement of claim was that, on a plain reading,
it did not convey that which it was explained
in the course of submissions it
to convey. The strike out application was properly made. To
suggest, as the plaintiff now does, that the defendants’ success
“merely” required a clarification of the pleading fails, with
respect, to grasp the fundamental importance of the pleading
itself to the
future conduct of the proceedings.
[10] The success
on the summary judgment application would have had greater ramifications for the
plaintiff, but the defendants’
success was more than merely trifling. They
obtained the strike out of the whole of the pleading, not a few sentences or
in isolation. They had to bring the application to achieve that
success, and should not have to bear the costs of doing so.
[11] Ultimately,
the issues were so inter-twined that this is not an appropriate case for a
departure from the usual rule, nor to
apportion costs. In a practical sense, the
applications were not separate and distinct. The defendants’ persistence
second basis for the summary judgment application does not, in the
circumstances, justify a departure from that usual rule. Both

are factually
distinguishable. They provide examples of costs orders being tailored to meet
the justice of the particular factual
scenario then before the Court, but
provide no real guidance here. Further, there is no rule or practice that costs
orders should
be “split” when there is mixed success on an
application for summary judgment, alternatively for striking
[12] Therefore,
the order earlier made as to the costs of the primary application will not be
disturbed. Although the plaintiff’s
submissions are silent on the issue,
the defendants have wholly succeeded on this application, and they should have
