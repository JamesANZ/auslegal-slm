Legal Education Review
, Vol 22, No.1, 2012, pp 121-145
Over the last couple of decades in Australia a number of factors have set the
scene for a radical rethinking of the way practical
legal training should occur
between the completion of an undergraduate degree and admission to legal
Firstly, there was a shift from practical legal training on the job, based on
articles of clerkship (‘Articles’), to practical
legal training
within a tertiary education setting. Secondly, the growth of the internet has
led to the creation of a market imperative
that online practical legal training
is provided. Thirdly, the student population has developed socially and
economically in such
a way that it is now demanding flexible, but relevant,
legal education that will accommodate full-time work, families and other social
and community commitments. Finally, the shift to institution-based rather than
workplace-based practical legal training has led to
the development of
competencies as the basis for assessing whether students are ‘ready’
for practice.
Since January 2010 the Australian National University Legal Workshop’s
response has been to provide practical legal training
by placing students into
‘firms’ of ‘junior solicitors’ to carry out legal
transactions in an online simulated
legal environment.
As an adjunct to embracing this simulated legal environment and
enforced group work, the purpose and identity of assessment
has become less
focused on examining a student in a summative sense to check for competence. It
has, rather, taken on a drifting,
less tangible (but no less significant) role
that is more akin to the ‘formative-plus-student self-assessment’
for assessment espoused by Boud and Falchikov.
In summary, there is a general feeling by the law student population that, to
meet its needs, legal education and assessment in legal
education needs to be
responsive and relevant to a diverse legal profession. And, broadly speaking,
current methods of teaching are
not meeting this need.
Furthermore, writers such as Boud have taken the discussion of formative
learning and assessment and extended its relevance beyond
academia to espouse
the need for an assessment regime that functions as the catalyst for students to
become active players in assessment
rather than passive receivers of marks or
skills to make
complex judgements about their own work.
The evolution of a significant change in educational direction by any
institution is never simple. As the purpose of this article
is not to do justice
to or describe the mechanics, trial and trauma of this change in depth, it is
sufficient to indicate that the
work of Boud and Falchikov sparked an interest
in changing the strategic direction at ANU Legal Workshop to achieve sustainable
and lifelong learning. Once this occurred, a search began for an
educational framework to meet this need within the constraints of
a competency
and institutional based online environment. A further encounter with Paul Maharg
and the SIMPLE project team at Strathclyde
University provided a new pedagogical
direction that ticked many of the required boxes needed to create sustainable
assessment. SIMPLE
was described as a:
SIMulated Professional Learning Environment [that] enables students to engage
in online simulations of professional practice. Its
special pedagogy is based on
transactional learning: active learning through performance in authentic
transactions involving reflection
in & on learning, deep collaborative
learning, and holistic or process learning, with relevant professional
assessment that includes
ethical standards.
Some of the other mechanisms enabled by SIMPLE were for students to receive
feed-forward and feedback on work in an ongoing fashion
and the opportunity to
redo work until such time as it had reached a competent standard. In addition,
the SIMPLE environment enables
students to work in groups to complete tasks;
exposes them to legal content areas in context; and presents both content areas
assessment in an integrated fashion rather than as silo subject areas or
assessment timetables.
The result of this fusion of Boud/Falchikov and SIMPLE was the development of
an 18-week, entirely online, professional practice core
course. This course,
named the Professional Practice Core (PPC) Course, integrated the previously
individually taught areas
of property, commercial litigation, civil litigation,
trust accounting and ethics as well as the barely taught practice management
competencies into a single course environment. This integrated learning
environment (ILE) engages students simultaneously on two
levels: (1) An
‘in role’ simulation environment comprised of a virtual office space
(VOS) where students work in groups
with up to four other students to create a
team of lawyers engaging ‘in role’ in transactions in a virtual firm
environment.
In this space students work to complete transactions involved in
conducting files with direction and support in the form of task
allocation, and
receive feed-forward and feedback from Senior Partners, Associates, clients and
other characters that are representative
of a lawyer’s experience in
practice (‘in role’ learning); and (2) An ‘out of role’
support website
using the university’s learning management system allows
students to engage with each other and teaching staff to access and
additional resources and information to support their ‘in role’
learning. In this area students are also required
to complete individual
assessment tasks (‘out of role’ learning).
Assessment within this environment is integrated within the tasks, so that it
is occurring in an ongoing manner and involves substantial
formative feedback
and feed-forward. Students must operate as a group to discern the tasks,
problems and issues that need to be addressed
and then provide and resubmit
their responses to their supervisors until such time as they reach a competent
In addition to the VOS used for the ‘in role’ work, an ‘out
of role’ learning website is also provided. This
site is a backup to
student learning and offers: a repository of helpful links and resources; an
‘out of role’ Q &
A and discussion forum; and information about
and the location for all individual ‘out of role’ assessment
‘Out of role’ assessment takes the form of formative quizzes,
reflective writing pieces, individual transactional tasks
(such as conducting an
interlocutory application by web conferencing or the completion of a set of
legal practice trust accounting
books). Importantly, ‘out of role’
assessment is not seen as more worthy, or as an alternative to ‘in
assessment. Rather, it is designed to complement the work being done
in the ‘in role’ VOS of the student firm group.
The design of the ‘out of role’ assessment is aimed at motivating
individual learning and achievement, and also rewarding
those who have actively
engaged in the group work. For example, if a student has not engaged with the
group work, they will find
it far more difficult to complete their individual
tasks. Thus, while the individual assessments are designed to enhance and
the group learning experience, there is an individual warranting
function built in as well – we can warrant that individual
students have
achieved a competent rating against the APLEC admitting requirements without
‘riding on the coattails’
of their peers in the group work.
In addition, assessment is only graded as being: Not Yet Competent (NYC),
Competent (C) or Higher Level Performance (HLP) and does
not involve numerical
marks or any form of bell curving. Students must reach at least a competent
standard on all group and individual
work in order to successfully complete the
course; and neither group nor individual work is rated higher than the
The end result of the combined regime of ‘in role’ and ‘out
of role’ assessment tasks is that students are
exposed to a plethora of
‘assessment’ formats in an ongoing fashion throughout the This
mixture of assessment styles
allows assessment to appear as both summative (by
allowing us to externally warrant that students have demonstrated at least a
competency) and formative (the assessment is so integrated within the
required tasks that it is central to the learning process).
At ANU Legal Workshop, the adoption of the SIMPLE based model for the
Professional Practice Core Course was essentially aimed at bringing
back a more
practical, participation-based learning system.
Boud and Falchikov have suggested that a sustainable assessment regime could
include a combination of the following characteristics:
(1) engages with
standards and criteria and problem analysis; (2) emphasises importance of
context; (3) involves working in association
with others and authentic
representations and productions and promotes seeking appropriate feedback; (4)
fosters reflexivity and
considers risk and confidence of judgement; (5) builds
learner agency and constructs active learners; and (6) Requires portrayal
outcomes for different purposes.
By analysing the case study of the PPC course and assessment structure
against each of these characteristics, we may gain some guidance
as to whether a
sustainable assessment regime has been/is being created.
Within the ‘in role’ learning environment students do not receive
tasks according to a timetable with set criteria next
to them. Instead they
receive letters of instructions from clients or videos of a client interview or
an internal memorandum with
accompanying authentic documents from their Senior
Partner. These outline an issue or give a short description of the legal task
required. This means students are engaged in identifying, from the information
presented to them, the parameters, structure, form
and deadlines for the tasks
received. They then need to do the appropriate research individually and as a
group to scaffold their
knowledge in order to complete the tasks. Options for
appropriate assistance in scaffolding their knowledge are provided through:
their practice mentor (a legal practitioner assigned to each firm to assist with
mentoring the group dynamics and practice management
and professionalism
skills); (2) the ‘in role’ characters such as associates, clerks
and senior partners (‘played’
by a legal practitioner assigned to
the firm) and fellow group members; (3) the ‘out of role’ discussion
forums and resource
library; and (4) external sources of information such as the
internet, previous undergraduate course notes and texts and (if they
legal environment) their own work colleagues.
Furthermore, within the group and over the course of their interactions with
clients and
Senior Partners/Associates, the students need to develop the skill of
identifying the criteria and standards for a competent piece
of work. Broad
criteria are available to students in the ‘out of role’
students’ space regarding the nature of
appropriate professional writing
styles and analysis. However, students must engage with the work provided in
good faith and thus
learn the standards to be expected by the responses they
receive in the feedback and feed forward.
In a practical legal training environment, context is fundamental. Students
need to learn to join together their knowledge from undergraduate
studies with
the relevant skills required to make a competent and professional lawyer, such
as effectively communicating, researching,
advising, negotiating, and
advocating. By requiring students to work in groups within a simulated law firm
environment to complete
entire matter files, they must learn to locate issues in
the context of the ‘messy’ legal file and the functioning legal
In addition, the group of students must assess among themselves what aspects
of their work require feedback from each other or from
the Associate or Senior
Partner. Ultimately, a confident team of students may reach a point near the end
of the course where they
do not race to meet the optional deadline of providing
work to the Associate for feed-forward because they feel that their work is
standard to go directly to the Senior Partner for sign off.
Furthermore, as a significant number of the ‘out of role’
individual assessments are extensions of the simulated legal
context the
students are experiencing in the ‘in role’ group work, even the
individual assessments are not removed from
the ‘realities’ of legal
As a starting point, the students are required to work with the same student
group of four for the group work and assessment within
the ‘in role’
Virtual Office Space for the entire 18 weeks of the course. As the group is
required to submit only one
combined response to any task within the virtual
office environment, they must necessarily work together to combine resources,
edit and re-edit each other’s work in order to complete the matter
file. As a result, the egalitarian transference of knowledge
and assisting each
other to discuss solutions to issues is actively encouraged. Importantly, this
environment requires them to demonstrate
and develop the essential skills of how
to give and receive feedback on all work from their immediate peers in an
ongoing fashion.
Student groups are also ‘paired off against’ each other on either
side of the matter files they are dealing with. As such,
the student groups must
negotiate how to conduct a matter when there are ‘real’ solicitors
acting for the other side
and, as such, they must deal with situations where the
solicitors may not act as they had hoped – not returning work on time,
advising their clients as expected, or not seeing the issues as they see
In addition to working with other students, the student group and individuals
must work in association with the other third party
‘characters’
within the virtual office environment –clients, clerks, Associates, banks,
Senior Partners, administrative
staff – to ascertain and complete the
tasks required to complete the matter file to a competent standard. These
‘characters’
are ‘played’ by real, often currently
practising legal practitioners, who are casually employed and trained to play
Furthermore, the students can engage with lecturers and employed legal
practitioners within the ‘out of role’ space to
further their
understanding of concepts and the practice of law. Most significantly, the
students engage with their practice mentors
(legal practitioners employed to
mentor the firm groups) to develop an understanding of the legal practice
context and what constitutes
fundamental elements of practice management.
The integrated, authentic PPC simulations require students to make linkages
between: (1) the content knowledge obtained in their
undergraduate degrees
and private work experience; (2) the resources available within the ‘in
role’ and ‘out of
role’ spaces; and (3) their independent
research and the knowledge and experience of the people they are working with,
to construct
solutions to the problems they have identified both within the
group ‘in role’ space and when completing their individual
assessment tasks.
For example, within one of the commercial transactions, the students had to
negotiate a confusing web of interconnected directors
and trustees duties to
negotiate settlement of a conflict that had arisen between these duties in a
manner that suited all parties
(who wished to remain friends and business
partners). Some students took a very litigious approach to the situation but
then realised
in the end of transaction debrief with their mentor that, by doing
so, they had failed to actually meet their client’s goal
of continuing to
work together. As long as the students who took the litigious approach were able
to recognise that other pathways
may have been more successful in providing a
solution to the client’s needs, they could still achieve competency for
of practice.
As such, the simulated transactions encourage students to test their
‘old’ theoretical knowledge in a practical environment
self-assess whether they have been successful in doing so within an
authentic legal practice context.
While it is difficult to suggest that the PPC Course actually allows students
to create their own assessment tasks in order to build
learning agency, it is
arguable that a number of features of the PPC Course assist in building learning
agency and constructing active
Firstly, the need for students to discern the required tasks from a matter
file rather than simply doing the tasks outlined on an
assessment timetable
means that they do effectively have to create an assessable task out of the
material provided and then construct
solutions based on the resources and
knowledge available to them.
Secondly, the fact that students have to continue to do work by responding to
the feed-forward and feedback that they receive from
fellow students and their
Associate until they get it right is also motivation to be fully engaged with
the work in the first place.
For example, as there is no ability to just choose
the best pieces of assessment to be included, or only engage with ‘the
significant’, or easiest pieces of assessment in order to
‘merely pass’, students are motivated to be engaged with
from the beginning.
This motivation is further encouraged through the advertisement of the clear
link between participation within the group work and
the individual assessment,
and by the fact that there is also a very evident link between the work required
of them and the work
they will need to complete upon entering the
profession.
With the focus of the PPC Course on providing opportunities to develop
exactly those skills required to complete the tasks of a legal
practitioner, it
is definitely arguable that the course ‘identifiably leaves[s] students
better equipped to complete future
tasks’. Indeed, students themselves
have commented in the end of course evaluations that they feel better equipped
with going into practice now that they have had the opportunity to
practise skills that ostensibly appear to be applicable to the
profession they
are seeking to enter.
In summary, assessment within the PPC is beginning to work in harmony with
the innovations in curriculum development and delivery.
At times, assessment
may be hidden altogether; and the assessors, instead of being arbitrary
markers, become mentors and role
models for the legal profession. As such, they
are able to use assessment to assist in creating competence for the
whilst also completing the necessary warranting function required for
entry level lawyers. It may just be an example of sustainable
assessment in
