1 Mr Paton has been referred to the Drug Court for
this court to determine if he should be the subject of a Compulsory Drug
Order. For such an order to be made, Mr Paton must be both an
“eligible convicted offender” and also meet other suitability
requirements. A person is not an “eligible convicted offender” if
the person has been convicted at any time of very serious
crimes, such as murder
or manslaughter, sexual assault, commercial supply of drugs, or of any offence
involving the use of a
2 Mr Paton was dealt with in the
Children’s Court in 1984 for using an airgun in a public place, and a
“finding of guilt”
was recorded, but no “conviction”. As
the Drug Court must not make a Compulsory Drug Treatment Order
unless it is satisfied that the offender is an
“eligible convicted offender”, and therefore that he has not been
of an offence involving the use of a firearm. So is Mr Paton eligible
The Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional Centre
3 If the Drug Court makes a CDTO, then the offender has the special
opportunity of taking part in the intensive programs provided
Compulsory Drug Treatment Centre “CDTCC” at Parklea. During the
Second Reading Speech to Parliament, when
the CDTCC Bill
introduced, it was noted that “the centre will target a hard-core group of
offenders with long-term drug addiction and
who have an associated life of crime
and constant imprisonment.”
4 Parliament was also told:
“Serious offenders convicted, at any time, of offences such as murder,
manslaughter, sexual assault,
firearms-related offences or commercial drug
trafficking will be excluded from the program. Offenders with a serious or
violent mental
condition, illness or disorder, which could prevent or restrict
the person’s active participation in the program, will also
excluded...”
5 So it is apparent that, for good reason, Parliament
provided that serious and dangerous offenders would not have the opportunities
of the program, and hence the possibility of access to supervised time in the
community before the end of their non-parole periods.
6 On 7 November 1984 Jamie Paton appeared before the Moss
Vale Children’s Court, and admitted to using a Daisy airgun at the
Railway Station. A finding of guilt was recorded, and he was fined $50 and the
airgun forfeited. Those court papers record
his date of birth as 24 January
1969, so he was dealt with as a 15 year old
7 The facts
tendered to the court show that Mr Paton, who was a Station Assistant, arrived
at Bowral railway station from Mittagong
with a Daisy B.B. Air rifle which he
owned. He then began firing at several pigeons sitting on the railway lines
between the platforms.
He was told to stop by the Assistant Station Master, and
leave the station, but he did not, and instead went into the parcels office
another Station Assistant. The other man then fired the air rifle from inside
the doorway of the parcels office at the railway
lines. It was later discovered
that air rifle pellets had damaged two or three window panes, the glass in the
front of an oil heater
and the glass in the front of a set of scales. The
co-offenders both denied causing the above damage, and there appears to have
no proceedings either commenced, or concluded, against Mr Paton in relation
to that damage.
8 The fundamental issue is as to
whether the “finding of guilt” recorded in the Children’s
Court in 1984 is a “conviction”
for the purposes of
Drug Court Act 1998
. There is no dispute that the airgun was a
firearm, and no other issues regarding eligibility or suitability are in
9 To resolve the issue, there is a need to firstly look at the
legislative landscape of 1984. At that time, criminal proceedings against
children and young persons were governed by the (now repealed)
Child Welfare
Act of 1939
. Section 128 of that Act provided:
10 “The words
“conviction”, “sentence” and “imprisonment”
shall cease to be used in relation
to children and young persons dealt with
summarily, and any reference in any enactment to a person convicted, a
conviction, a sentence
or imprisonment shall, in the case of a child or young
person, be construed as a reference to a person found guilty of an offence,
finding of guilt, an order made upon such a finding or a detention as the case
11 So not only was no conviction recorded against young Mr
Paton, the recording of a conviction was not a possible outcome of the
proceedings at Moss Vale Children’s Court.
12 There is a long
tradition in children’s law, for good reason, for convictions not to be
recorded in every case involving
children and young persons. The current law,
provided in the
Children’s (Criminal Proceedings) Act of 1987
allows convictions to be recorded against young persons (over 16 years) but
prohibits the recording of convictions against
children (under 16), as Mr Paton
apparently was, in 1984.
13 Ms Atkins, of the Office of the Director of
Public Prosecutions, who has assisted the Drug Court in this hearing, relies
principally
on s 128 of the
Child Welfare Act
. However in my view that
section appears to be a one-way street, heading in the opposite direction to the
problem facing this court.
That section allowed any reference
(my emphasis) to a person convicted, or a conviction, etc. to be
construed as a reference to a person found guilty of an offence,
or a finding of
guilt. It does not provide the contra flow that a person subject to a finding of
guilt is to be construed as a reference
to a conviction.
readily see the obvious use of such a section, whereby, for example, other Acts
of Parliament provide for sentences or
imprisonment upon conviction for a breach
of that legislation, and this section is a vehicle for the Children’s
Court to make
findings of guilt, and to require the detention, of the juvenile
in question. In this way no separate provision is required in each
legislation for orders of detention to be imposed if a finding of guilt has been
recorded against a child or young person
in the Children’s
15 We therefore have the clear situation that no conviction has
been recorded. However, should the finding of guilt which was recorded
regarded by this court as a conviction for the purposes of
16 In my view, the answer is “No”, and there
are a number of reasons for reaching that conclusion:
1)The concept of legislation having beneficial purposes does apply to this
situation. As I held in R v Tewake
[2005] NSWDRGC 2
, there can be no doubt that
Drug Court Act
is beneficial legislation, and it has long been established
that it should be interpreted accordingly. The concept of legislation
beneficial purposes was referred to in Chandler v DPP
[2000] NSWCA 125
[2000] 113 A Crim R 196
which in turn referred to Bull v Attorney-General of New South Wales
[1913] HCA 54
, where the concept was explained (at page 384) in the following way;
“The correct way of reading legislation where there is such an
ambiguity is to construe them generously. Not that the true signification
provision should be strained or exceeded, but that it should be construed to
give the fullest relief with which the fair meaning
of its language will
17 If Parliament had intended
to ensure that persons who had used firearms in their childhood were to be
excluded from the opportunity
of taking part in a CDTCC program, then that would
have been a simple matter of drafting to makes sure the ineligibility criteria
encompassed such offenders.
2) Any similar child offender who committed such a crime after 1987 could not be
convicted by virtue of the law as it applies to
children since then. Whilst it
might be rather remote to expect the legislators to have considered the possible
need to exclude pre-1987
child offenders, there is not even an exclusion of
post-1987 child offenders who may have been dealt with without a conviction
current children’s law. One would expect any such child offenders
would have been specifically excluded, if there was an intention
to exclude such
3) It could not be argued that a boy who had used an air gun 23 years ago, and
who was dealt with by way of a $50 fine, could be
categorised, by virtue of that
offence, as such a serious offender that he should be excluded from the
opportunity of a CDTO.
4) Mr Paton is not someone who would otherwise be regarded as a violent or
dangerous offender. As Ms Maher has pointed out, his adult
offences are driving,
drug and dishonesty matters. He has not committed personal violence offences
such as robberies, and his extensive
custodial history does not record any
violent offences – there is only one offence of failing to attend for a
prison muster.
18 Accordingly, I am satisfied
that the finding of guilt recorded against Mr Paton in 1984 is not a
“conviction” for the
purposes of
Drug Court Act
Further, I am also satisfied that Mr Paton is both an eligible and a suitable
offender, and a Compulsory Drug Treatment Order will
be made today.

West, on behalf of Attorney General Debus.
criminal history records a number of dates of birth, usually January 1969, but
sometimes 1967,1968, and 1970.
