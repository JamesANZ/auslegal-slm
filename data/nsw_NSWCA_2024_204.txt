From early 1997 to late 2019, Access Group Training (
nationally accredited vocational training services in various Australian States
and the Australian Capital Territory. At
all relevant times, all the shares in
AGT were held by two married couples: James and Judith Jane, and John and
Suellen Goard (
AGT Shareholders
On 13 January 2015, Venture Capital Fund Australia Limited (
incorporated, and specialised in identifying venture capital opportunities for
wealthy individuals. Mr Lambert was a founder
of VCFA and its managing
From around mid-2014, Mr Lambert and Mr Jane discussed the possibility of
expanding AGT’s operations. At the time, Mr Lambert
and various of his
associates were looking to develop the aged care sector in China, and thought
that AGT could assist with the training
and accreditation of Chinese aged care
workers. Mr Lambert suggested that, in order to assist AGT’s registration
in China as
a vocational training provider, Mr Jane should consider listing AGT
on the Australian Stock Exchange (
). Because of a concern that such a
listing would affect profitable contracts which AGT held with the Commonwealth
Government, it
was proposed that a parent company (
incorporated to hold all the shares in AGT, and Holdings would be listed on the
ASX instead. On 20 October 2015, Holdings was
incorporated for this purpose; all
its shares were then held by the AGT Shareholders.
At this stage, it was proposed that: (a) VCFA would subscribe for 17,000,000
shares in Holdings (74% of Holdings) for a price of $1,700,000
Subscription Agreement
); (b) Holdings would use this $1,700,000 for the sole
purpose of paying a deposit to the AGT Shareholders for the purpose of
their shares in AGT, with Holdings then becoming the sole shareholder
Share Sale Agreement
); (c) Mr Jane would become Holdings’
managing director, and be issued 6,000,000 shares (representing a 26% stake in
(d) Holdings would then undertake an initial public offering (IPO) at
a price of $0.20 per share, with a view to listing on the ASX
by 31 December
In late August 2016, pursuant to the Share Subscription Agreement, VCFA
acquired 74% of the shares in Holdings for $1,700,000. At
this stage, although
Holdings then paid $1,700,000 to the AGT Shareholders for the purchase of their
shares in AGT, the Share Sale
Agreement had not yet been executed, and the
shares in AGT were not transferred by the AGT Shareholders to Holdings.
During this time, AGT (or its management company, AGT Management) advanced to
VCFA the sum of $1,300,000 purportedly for the purpose
of VCFA developing
educational businesses in China in support of the IPO. Accordingly, VCFA
contended that this sum was advanced
as payment for services, whereas AGT
contended that it had advanced the sum as a loan to be repaid.
In 2019, Holdings commenced proceedings against the AGT Shareholders to
recover the sum of $1,700,000 (either pursuant to the Share
Sale Agreement, or
as moneys had and received) (
2019 Proceedings
). In 2020, AGT commenced
proceedings against VCFA in relation to the alleged unpaid loan in the sum of
$1,300,000 plus interest (
2020 Proceedings
The primary judge heard both proceedings concurrently. It was concluded by
his Honour that (a) the Share Sale Agreement had been properly
executed, such
that the AGT Shareholders were liable to Holdings for the sum of $1,700,000; and
(b) the sum of $1,300,000 was advanced
by AGT to VCFA as a loan, and was
therefore payable to AGT (together with interest). However, pursuant to a
set-off clause in cl
5.9 of the Share Sale Agreement, the AGT Shareholders were
entitled to set-off their successful claim of $1,300,000 (plus interest)
against their $1,700,000 liability to Holdings. After the application of this
set-off, judgment was entered in favour of AGT in
the sum of $176,971.63. On the
basis of this result, the primary judge ordered that each party was to bear its
VCFA appealed in relation to various aspects of the finding that the
$1,300,000 advanced to it by AGT was a loan. AGT cross-appealed
in relation to
the primary judge’s determination as to costs.
The Court held
(Ward P, Payne JA agreeing, Basten AJA writing
separately in relation to the cross-appeal), dismissing the appeal with costs,
allowing the cross-appeal:
(1) As to Ground 1, to the extent the primary judge referred
to private uncommunicated views as to the proper characterisation of
payments in AGT Management’s internal accounts, that is to be understood
as being in the context of exploring whether there
was conduct by AGT that was
inconsistent with its assertion that the payments were a loan. This material was
not referred to in the
context of locating whether there was a common assumption
between the parties as to the existence of any agreement: [91] (Ward P);
(Payne JA); [202] (Basten AJA).
Johnston v Brightstars Holding Company Pty Ltd
[2014] NSWCA 150
considered.
(2) As to Grounds 2-6, the evidence of an intercompany loan
as between AGT and AGT Management in respect of the payments does not
from the characterisation of the payments to VCFA as being way of a loan. The
fact that no input credit was claimed for GST
in the internal accounts of AGT
Management supports this conclusion. In this regard, the primary judge again did
not refer to this
evidence as evidence establishing a common assumption between
the parties; such reference was strictly in the context of determining
there was inconsistent conduct on the part of AGT and/or AGT Management.
Although the primary judge took into account the
fact that GST was paid on the
invoices rendered by VCFA to AGT, the support this gave to VCFA’s case was
contradicted by the
unreliability of these invoices: [106]-[112] (Ward P); [201]
(Payne JA); [202] (Basten AJA).
(3) As to Grounds 7-8, the primary judge did not err in
concluding that the email dated 20 November 2015, in which AGT represented
the payments made to VCFA to date were properly considered a loan, together with
the absence of any contemporaneous dispute
by VCFA, did reveal a common
assumption that the substance of the transaction was a loan: [122] (Ward P);
[201] (Payne JA); [202]
(Basten AJA).
(4) As to Grounds 9-10, the primary relevance of the 15
February 2016 letter was that it revealed an assumption that there was an
owing as at 31 December 2015 of $440,000, and did not make any reference to an
amount payable by way of fee for service. The
incorrect assertion that loan
repayments had been made to date does not alter the letter’s relevance in
this regard. Relevant
also was the fact that the $440,000 sum referenced in the
letter corresponded exactly to the amount that had been paid directly by
VCFA in September 2015. The entire sum advanced ($1,300,000) was indisputably
paid in tranches: [138]-[141] (Ward P); [201]
(Payne JA); [202] (Basten
(5) As to Grounds 11-12, the 14 September 2016 email did not
in terms deny the existence of a loan, but simply that there was never
agreement for repayment, and that the general understanding was that these funds
would be recouped as a result of the listing.
There was no suggestion that the
term “advance” denoted payment for services: [151]-[155] (Ward P);
[201] (Payne JA);
[202] (Basten AJA).
(6) As to the cross-appeal, where there are multiple
“events” for the purposes of the r 42.1 of the Uniform Civil
Rule 2005 (NSW), the apportionment of costs across multiple issues can
properly be done on an impressionistic basis. The $1,700,000
claim and the
set-off claim were sufficiently interlinked so as to not warrant a deduction
from the costs payable to the successful
cross-appellants. However, given that
some of the set-off claims failed, it is appropriate, on a broad-brush approach,
to order that
the cross-respondents are to pay 75% of the
cross-appellant’s costs of the primary proceedings: [182]-[199] (Ward P);
(Payne JA).

Galati v Deans (No 2)
[2023] NSWCA 252
: This appeal is a consolidation of appeals from decisions in two sets of
independent but related proceedings in the Equity Division:
the 2019 proceedings
(2019/374869) and the 2020 proceedings (2020/219022). The respondents were
providers of vocational training
in Australia. In 2016 they agreed with the
appellants to establish a business in China to provide training for workers in
care sector. The plans included listing a company on the Australian
Stock Exchange (ASX). The plans came to naught, but only after
steps had been
taken to establish the business and significant payments made between the
respective parties. The proceedings in the
Equity Division involved disputes
which arose in unwinding the venture.
2019 proceedings involved a claim by Access Training Group Ltd (the first
appellant, and cross-respondent, in the consolidated
appeal, to which I will
refer, as “Holdings”, because its initials readily lead to confusion
with the fifth respondent)
against four individuals, Mr James Jane and Mrs
Judith Jane, and Mr John Goard and Mrs Suellen Goard (the first to fourth
respondents,
and cross-appellant) in the consolidated appeal, to whom I will
refer as the Jane Defendants, who were shareholders of Access Group
Training Pty
Ltd (AGT), the fifth respondent. In those proceedings, Holdings sought to
recover a sum of $1.7 million as moneys had
and received (following the failure
to proceed with a proposed initial public offering (IPO) in relation to the
shares of Holdings)
or alternatively pursuant to the terms of a Share Sale
Agreement dated 28 February 2017 between the Jane Defendants and Holdings,
in relation to the shares held in Access Group Training Pty Ltd (the fifth
respondent in the consolidated appeal, to which I will
refer as AGT) (the
execution of which was in issue).
Jane Defendants denied any obligation to repay the claimed amount but also
asserted set-offs against any amount that might be
payable: those being an
amount claimed to be owing to AGT as a debt by a company related to Holdings,
Venture Capital Fund Australia
Ltd (the second appellant in the consolidated
appeal, to which I will refer as VCFA) (in the order of $1.45 million); and an
of $985,000 in respect of alleged float expenses in relation to the
proposed IPO (AT 1.35-50).
2020 proceedings were brought by AGT against VCFA seeking to recover an alleged
unpaid loan of $1.3 million plus interest (which
could then be set-off against
the claimed sum in the 2019 proceedings pursuant to cl 5.9(d) of the Share Sale
Agreement, assuming
of course that that was enforceable). VCFA admitted that the
sum of $1.3 million had been paid to it but disputed its characterisation
loan, contending that the money was paid for services provided by VCFA. AGT also
claimed an amount of $150,000 said to be unpaid
rent (AT 1.46-50).
two proceedings were heard together on various dates in October and November
2023, with evidence in one being treated as evidence
in the other. The primary
judge handed down his reasons for judgment on 22 November 2023 (
Training Group Limited v James Michael Jane
Access Group Training
Limited v Venture Capital Fund Australia Limited
[2023] NSWSC 1416
primary judgment).
primary judge held that the sum of $1.3 million paid by AGT to VCFA was a loan;
that interest accrued on that loan at the rate
of 10% from the date of each
advance; and that no amount had been repaid by VCFA in respect of the principal
or interest on the loan
(see [102] of the primary judgment), such that, as at 17
July 2019, VCFA was indebted to AGT in respect of the sum of $1,300,035
interest thereon at 10% per annum ([266]). However, his Honour also found that,
pursuant to cl 5.9(d) of the Share Sale Agreement
dated 28 February 2017, the
Jane Defendants were entitled to set-off their individual liabilities to
Holdings under that agreement
(in aggregate amounting to $1.7 million) against
the liability of VCFA to AGT in relation to the loan ($1.3 million plus
such that, after the application of the contractual set-off, no
amount was payable by the Jane Defendants to Holdings in respect
of the sum of
$1.7 million ([268]). His Honour rejected the claimed set-off for float expenses
in the 2019 proceedings and for unpaid
rent in the 2020 proceedings,
respectively. The upshot of this was a net judgment in favour of AGT against
VCFA for $176,971.63.
a subsequent judgment on the papers following written submissions as to costs
Access Training Group Limited v James Michael Jane
Access Group
Training Limited v Venture Capital Fund Australia Limited (No 2)
NSWSC 1632)
(the costs judgment), his Honour concluded, relevantly as to costs,
that the appropriate outcome (having regard to the broad discretion
as to costs
and the mixed success of each set of parties in the proceedings), was that each
party bear its own costs of each set
of proceedings ([9]). His Honour considered
that this appropriately reflected the fact that the outcome of the proceedings
essence, that each set of parties owed debts of similar size to the
other, this being a position for which no party had contended.
notices of appeal each filed on 20 March 2024 in separate appeal proceedings,
Holdings appealed from the primary judge’s
rejection of, or failure to
deal with, its claim in the 2019 proceedings that reliance by the Jane
Defendants on cl 5.9(d)(ii) of
the Share Sale Agreement was unconscionable
and VCFA appealed from the upholding of the loan claimed by AGT in the 2020
proceedings.
notices of cross-appeal filed on 9 April 2019 in the respective appeal
proceedings, the Jane Defendants and AGT each cross-appealed
as to the finding
by the primary judge that there was no binding agreement for reimbursement of
its costs of the IPO and as to the
costs order made by the primary judge. In
their notice of cross-appeal filed in relation to the 2019 proceedings, the Jane
included contentions that the primary judge’s decision ought be
upheld on grounds other than those relied on by his Honour.
They contended that
Holdings had not advanced at trial its alternative claim (pleaded at [36]-[46]
of the Amended Statement of Claim)
and that the primary judge could not have
been satisfied that reliance on cl 5.9(d)(ii) of the Share Sale Agreement was
unconscionable
(because of the matters set out in ground 4(a)-(e) of the
cross-appeal grounds).
the Share Sale Agreement (in the 2019 proceedings).
What remained pressed by the
Holdings/VCFA parties was only the appeal by VCFA against the upholding of the
claimed $1.3 million
loan by AGT to VCFA.
the abandonment by Holdings of its challenge to the Share Sale Agreement, AGT
and the Jane Defendants did not press their
cross-appeal as to the claimed
agreement for reimbursement of their costs of the IPO (or, in the case of the
Jane Defendants, their
contention as to the unconscionable reliance claim),
maintaining only their cross-appeals as to costs.
significance of the reduced scope of the appeal proceedings in this Court is
that if VCFA succeeds in challenging the finding
in relation to the upholding of
the loan (i.e., if its contention that the amount in question was paid by AGT
for services rendered
by VCFA) and the cross-appeal is dismissed, then there
will be nothing for the Jane Defendants to set-off as against their liabilities
to Holdings. In those circumstances, the appellants say that VCFA’s
liability to AGT is nil and that the Jane Defendants remain
liable to Holdings
in aggregate for $1.7 million (plus interest).
consequence of the fact that the cross-appeals were thus reduced to appeals in
relation to costs alone was that the cross-appellants
proceeded on the basis
that they required leave to prosecute both cross-appeals pursuant to
s 101(2)(c)
Supreme Court Act 1970
(NSW) (AT 37).
premise of that concession as to the requirement for leave may be moot, given
that, when commenced, the cross-appeals could not
be said to have been
incompetent because they were not then restricted to costs. The requirement for
leave where there is a cross-appeal
on costs alone was considered by Leeming JA
Housman v Camuglia
(2021) 104 NSWLR 615
[2021] NSWCA 106
) at [43]-[84] but in that case the cross-appeal had been limited
to costs at the outset. In any event, in circumstances where the
cross-appellants have proceeded on the basis that leave is necessary, it is
appropriate to address that aspect of the matter on that
basis (as I do in due
is necessary, given the nub of the complaint here made as to the insufficiency
of weight given to the appellants’ internal
records, and the paucity of
documentation in relation to the alleged agreement or the services provided in
respect of which invoices
were purportedly rendered, to set out in some detail
the chronology of events. References to paragraph numbers in what follows below
are taken, unless otherwise indicated, from the primary judgment. There is no
challenge to his Honour’s factual findings (rather,
the appellants simply
contend that additional findings should have been made, as I explain in due
early 1997 to late 2019, AGT provided nationally accredited vocational training
services in various Australian States and the
Australian Capital Territory
([2]). Each of the Jane Defendants held one quarter of the shares in AGT and
each was a director of
the company ([3]).
the mid-1990s, Mr Jane (an AGT shareholder and director) met Mr Ross Lambert
(later the founder and managing director of VCFA),
and they and their respective
spouses became close friends ([5]). From around mid-2014, Mr Jane and Mr
Lambert had discussions as
to a potential expansion of AGT into China. At that
time, Mr Lambert had business associates in China who were looking to develop
the aged care sector in China and thought that AGT could assist with the
training and accreditation of Chinese aged-care workers
was incorporated on 13 January 2015, specialising in identifying venture capital
opportunities for high net-worth investors (connecting
investors in China with
operations in Australia that were in need of venture capital) ([4]).
Lambert suggested that Mr Jane consider listing AGT on the ASX, explaining that
this would assist AGT to become registered in China
as a vocational training
provider, and would mean that the Jane Defendants could get a return by selling
shares in the business to
Chinese investors ([7]). The proposed listing of AGT
would also have been for VCFA’s benefit in that, in order to provide
for aged care workers in China, VCFA needed either to be included in
the Chinese Government’s education curriculum or to offer
its training
services through a listed education company on a respected international stock
exchange ([8]).
of a concern that the listing of AGT might affect profitable contracts which AGT
held with the Commonwealth government, the
proposal changed to one where a
parent company (Holdings) would be incorporated to hold all of the shares in
AGT, and that parent
company would be listed on the ASX ([9]). On 20 October
2015, Holdings was incorporated for this purpose ([9]). On incorporation,
the shares in Holdings were held by the Jane Defendants.
[10], the primary judge described what was proposed as follows:
It was proposed, in broad terms, that the following steps would be taken in
respect of the proposed listing: VCFA would subscribe
for 17m shares in Holdings
for a price of $1.7m (or $0.10 per share), and would thereby acquire a 74% stake
in the company; Holdings
would use this $1.7m for the sole purpose of paying a
deposit to the AGT Shareholders [i.e., the Jane Defendants] for the purchase
their shares in AGT; Holdings would become the sole shareholder of AGT; Mr Jane
would enter an employment agreement with Holdings
and become its managing
director; Holdings would issue 6 million shares to Mr Jane (representing a 26%
shareholding); and Holdings
would then undertake an initial public offering at a
price of $0.20 per share, with a view to listing on the ASX by 31 December 2016.
late August 2016, pursuant to the terms of a Share Subscription Agreement, VCFA
acquired 74% of the shares in Holdings for $1.7
million and this sum was
immediately paid to the Jane Defendants (in equal shares) ([11]). The Jane
Defendants held the remaining
26% of shares in Holdings. At the time of payment,
the terms of an agreement between Holdings and the Jane Defendants relating to
the sale of the shares in AGT (the Share Sale Agreement) had been negotiated but
not executed ([11]).
here, I note that the parties had opposing contentions in the 2019 proceedings
as to the status of the Share Sale Agreement,
which were as follows. Holdings
contended that the Share Sale Agreement was never executed (and hence its
principal claim was for
repayment of the claimed $1.7 million as money had
and received), whereas the Jane Defendants contended that the Share Sale
was in fact entered into in around late February 2017 ([13]-[14]).
There were different versions of the Share Sale Agreement in evidence;
version that his Honour accepted to have been duly executed by the respective
parties was signed by the Jane Defendants
but only by one of the directors of
Holdings, Dr Paula Robinson, and bore the date of 28 February 2017. The primary
judge dealt with
the status of the Share Sale Agreement at [181]-[189], finding
it likely that the Share Sale Agreement dated 28 February 2017 was
around 2 March 2017 ([189]) and (at [214]) that it was duly executed by Holdings
(and hence binding on it).
proposed listing of Holdings on the ASX by way of an IPO did not eventuate and
at some stage there was a falling out between the
2019, Holdings commenced proceedings against the Jane Defendants seeking to
recover the sum of $1.7 million that VCFA had paid
in August 2016 (the 2019
proceedings); and in 2020, AGT commenced proceedings against VCFA for the
alleged unpaid loan in the sum
of $1.3 million plus interest (the 2020
proceedings). Of relevance to the dispute as to the characterisation of the sum
of $1.3 million
(that VCFA admitted had been paid to it) are the following
further matters.
was developing certain educational businesses in China which it proposed would
be offered as part of the IPO ([22], [24]).
Management Pty Limited (AGT Management) was a company, registered in 2009, which
was related to AGT and formed part of the group
owned and controlled by Mr Jane
and Mr Goard (two of the Jane Defendants). The directors of AGT Management were
Mr Jane and Mr Goard.
August and September 2015, VCFA issued three invoices (variously to AGT or AGT
Management) for amounts totalling $1.3 million.
The original invoices were not
in evidence (and indeed there was evidence that copies of the invoices had not
been able to be obtained
until 2021 due to the lapse of subscription to a
FreshBooks invoicing programme).
first invoice was issued by VCFA to AGT Management on 3 August 2015 in the
amount of $600,000 plus GST bearing invoice number
ending in 001. The due date
was specified on the invoice to be the same date as the date of issue. The
narrative on the invoice was
“AGT float costs as discussed”. The
primary judge noted that there was no detail provided on the invoice of the
to which these costs related or the basis on which the figure had been
calculated ([34]) and inferred (from the fact that Mr Lambert
had claimed there
was a more detailed breakdown of the amounts on the invoices but, despite
deferral of his re-examination to enable
this to be produced, no such document
was produced) that there was no document available providing a more detailed
breakdown of the
amount claimed ([35]).
Management paid the amount of $660,000 to VCFA on 4 August 2015, the day after
the invoice was issued. (Although the copy invoice
in the Court Book indicates
that the amount was paid at the date of the invoice, I understand this is
because the copy invoice in
evidence was printed as at the time of the
proceedings.)
second invoice was issued by VCFA to AGT on 24 September 2015 in the sum of
$400,000 plus GST. The due date for payment specified
on the invoice was again
the date of the invoice. The invoice bore a tax invoice number ending in 002.
The narrative stated “IPO
costs – Preparation of prospectus
including copy writing, graphic design, research, creation of charts, and excel
spreadsheets”.
There was again no breakdown of how this amount was
calculated by reference to the work said to be done (see [41]).
29 September 2015, AGT paid $440,000 to VCFA.
third invoice was also dated 24 September 2015. It was issued by VCFA to AGT
Management. It was in the amount of $200,000 plus
GST. It specified the due date
as 24 October 2015. The invoice contained the following narrative:
Legal work including various documents
Share Sale agreement
Call option agreement
Training contract with Guangzhou college China
Consulting fees as discussed.
amount the subject of the third invoice was paid in tranches by AGT Management
(seven payments totalling $200,000) over a period
of some six months, but
leaving outstanding the sum of $20,000 which corresponded to the amount of the
GST specified on the invoice
noted, the three invoices bore sequential tax invoice numbers (ending in 001-003
respectively). Other than those three invoices,
there was no document predating
the payments which recorded, or referred to, either an agreement for services or
an agreement for
loan. The manner in which the payments were recorded in the
internal accounts of AGT/AGT Management is explained in due course.
November 2015 (shortly after the third invoice had been issued), there was an
email exchange to which his Honour attached some
significance. The exchange
commenced with an email sent on 20 November 2015 by Mr Jane to Mr Lambert, Mr
Elias Poulos (who was also
a director of VCFA), and two other persons, with the
subject header “transfer of $100k to VCFA”, stating that:
I have just authorised a transfer of $100k to VCFA –
AGT and AGT Management have now advanced as loan funds $1.2 million to VCFA.
Lambert replied by email on 26 November 2015, simply with the words
“[t]hanks Jim”. There was no evidence of any communication
Poulos or either of the other two recipients responding to this email. The
significance his Honour attached to this email
([55]) was that none of the
officers of VCFA to whom the email was addressed disputed that all of the
payments which had been made
to date represented advances to VCFA; and none
referred to any agreement for services or claimed that the amounts were in fact
in respect of services.
this time (late November 2015), payment in respect of the first two invoices
(totalling $1.1 million) had been made to VCFA and
on 20 November 2015 a further
payment of $100,000 was made to VCFA.
was also placed by his Honour on an email letter dated 15 February 2016 from Mr
Lambert, on VCFA’s letterhead, sent
to Mr Jane, which, relevantly,
LOAN REPAYMENT STATUS
Please be advised that we have been honouring our loan repayments as per our
agreement and confirm the following loan repayment position.
Date: Amount owed
31 December 2015 $440,000
Please let me know if there is anything further you require?
Honour noted (at [60]) that insofar as the letter suggested that loan repayments
had been made prior to 15 February 2016 this
was incorrect and that it was
common ground that no amount was paid back to AGT in respect of the $1.3 million
in issue in the proceedings.
is relevant at this point to note how the payments made by AGT/AGT Management
were recorded in their internal accounts. The first
payment (of $660,035 on 4
August 2015 – the additional $35 being referable to a bank fee) was
initially recorded in the books
of AGT Management by the external
bookkeeper/accountant of AGT/AGT Management, Ms Danielle Pearce, as “Loan
Capital” and noted that it was “BAS Excluded”.
On 5 August 2016 (presumably in the course of preparing the company’s
financial accounts for the year ending June 2016), Ms Pearce reallocated this
payment to “Loan – Access Group Training
Pty Ltd”. Mr Jane
explained in his evidence that this change was because the entity making the
loan was AGT, with AGT incurring
an intercompany liability to AGT Management for
the amount that AGT Management had advanced to VCFA on AGT’s behalf (see
[37]-[39]).
second payment (of $440,000) was initially allocated by Ms Pearce, on
6 October 2015, to “Equity, Capital Raising &
Expenses”. This was later amended by Ms Pearce on 23 November 2015 when
the entire amount was allocated to “Loan
– Venture Capital”
(again the notation “BAS Excluded”) ([44]).
to the third invoice, the payment of $100,000 to VCFA on 20 November 2015 was
initially allocated to “Loan – Venture
Capital”, again with
the notation “BAS Excluded”. Ms Pearce again, on 5 August 2016,
reallocated this payment from
“Loan – Venture Capital” to
“Loan – Access Group Training Pty Ltd” (reflecting an
intercompany
loan by AGT Management to AGT for the amount that AGT Management
had advanced to VCFA on AGT’s behalf ([56])). The six further
(from mid-February to mid-March 2016) totalling a further $100,000 from AGT
Management to VCFA (described in VCFA’s
bank statements as “AGT
Payment”) were initially entered in AGT Management’s accounts as
“Loan – Ross
Lambert” and subsequently assigned by Ms Pearce
in August 2016 to “Loan – Access Group Training Pty Ltd”;
each bore the notation “BAS Excluded” ([61]).
input credit for GST was claimed by AGT Management for any of the payments (see
[37], [44], [56]).
appears that in September 2016, in the context of documentation in relation to
the then still proposed IPO and an “AGT audit”
(presumably related
to the proposed IPO), there was discussion as to a proposed deed of
acknowledgement of loan in respect of the
payments that had been made to
8 September 2016, at 9am, Mr Warwick Kerridge sent an email to Mr Lambert,
apparently responding to a query raised by Mr Lambert
at 8.48am as to what Mr
Kerridge was referring to in an earlier communication by Mr Kerridge (at
8.44am) as to the need to “close
off the doc for the audit”.
Mr Kerridge identified what he had been referring to as the “deed re
loan account”
and attached three documents. Those were described in the
attachment details as: “AGT VCFA loan account deed of
acknowledgement”;
“AGT VCFA schedule 1 Loan – Details AGT
VCFA”; and “AGT VCFA Schedule 2 Interest Calculations”.
5.09pm that day, Mr Kerridge forwarded to Mr Lambert an attached signed (by Mr
Jane) version of “Loan Agreement between AGT
and VCFA”, advising
that “[i]n terms fo [sic] the audit please see the enclosed deed in the
form approved by the auditors
duly executed to be countersigned”. It
appears that the deed included the printed date 30 August 2016.
appears from an email sent by Mr Kerridge to Mr Poulos and Mr Lambert on 4 April
2018 that, on 12 September 2016, there was a meeting
between Mr Lambert, Mr
Poulos, and Mr Jane (and Mr Kerridge, the adviser to both sides, who did not
give evidence at trial), at which
there was discussion as to the deed of
acknowledgement. In the 4 April 2018 email, Mr Kerridge recorded that:
3. ... The discussions between Jim on behalf of AGT and Ross and Elias on behalf
of VCFA were quite heated at some points. Ross continued
to state the reasons
why he provided the original acknowledgment. Elias stated that there were indeed
no investments contributions
to be treated as loans or in fact ALL investor
contributions at the time should be treated as loans. Jim did not accept this.
and the writer [Mr Kerridge] expressed the view that UHY [the auditors]
required a form of certainty regarding the funds in the balance
sheet of AGT to
be provided so that UHY could be satisfied about the recoverability of the entry
which was recorded as a loan (receivable).
After continued debate Ross advised
Jim that he would sign as he did not want to hold up the IPO for everyones sake
but did not agree
with the deed. When offered to Elias to sign he declined and
said that he would think about it and speak to the Chinese. At that
original document had been signed by AGT (Jim Jane) and VCFA (Ross Lambert). The
original was left with the writer and
supplied to UHY.
reference in this email to the “original acknowledgement” appears to
be a reference to the document considered by
the primary judge at [65] to have
been the subject of a significant concession by Mr Lambert in cross-examination
(see [51] below);
and places the “Loan – Venture Capital Fund
Transactions” (Loan Acknowledgement), which is itself undated, as having
been signed before the 12 September 2016 meeting.
the response attributed to Mr Poulos (Elias) when cavilling with the proposition
that the amounts advanced were loans was
not an assertion that they were
payments for services rendered but, rather, a complaint that if some
“investments [sic] contributions”
were to be treated as loans, then
all investor contributions should be so treated. That said, as his Honour noted,
Mr Poulos was
not privy to the discussion(s) between Mr Lambert and Mr Jane in
which the relevant agreement (i.e., loan or fee for services) was
struck, so the
weight to be attributed to this later account attributed to Mr Poulos is limited
Loan Acknowledgement is a document apparently prepared for the purpose of
finalising the financial accounts of AGT for the year
ending 30 June 2016 (see
[67]). Appended to a single page headed “Loan – Venture Capital
Fund Transactions” are
the following acknowledgments:
Acknowledgement
The Lender Acknowledges that the above amounts have been loaned to Venture
Capital Fund
Director – Access Group Training Pty Ltd
The Borrower acknowledges that the above amounts have been received by Venture
Capital Fund Pty Ltd as a loan from Access Group Training
Director – Venture Capital Fund Pty Ltd
Loan Acknowledgement was signed by Mr Jane and Mr Lambert, respectively (and
there was a handwritten deletion of “Pty”
in the description of the
latter signatory’s company).
terms of the chronology this brings me to the first of two deeds which were the
subject of consideration by the primary judge (First
Deed). Although dated 30
August 2016, it seems from the email communications chasing its execution, that
the First Deed is likely
to have been signed by Mr Lambert after that date
– (and, on Mr Kerridge’s account, not until the 12 September
2016 meeting).
That said, I note his Honour’s finding (which the
appellants do not challenge) was that the First Deed was signed in August
(see [77]).
Honour concluded at [90] that the primary significance of the First Deed lay in
the acknowledgements set out in the Recitals:
A. The Company [AGT] has advanced principal sums to VCFA of
$1,300,035.00 (“The Primary Advances”) as detailed in
B. VCFA has not paid the Primary Advances and remains indebted
to The Company in respect thereto.
C. The Company is entitled to interest on commercial terms of
the Primary Advances at the rate of 10.00% on the variable balance
Primary Advances from the date of the first advance of 4th August to the date
hereof and continuing.
D. The interest due on the Primary Advances in (sic)
calculated in accordance with Schedule 2 hereof.
E. VCFA seeks to acknowledge the indebtedness to The Company
and to secure its indebtedness and enter into this Deed in furtherance
acknowledgement and covenant Operative Provisions
14 September 2016, Mr Kerridge sent an email to Mr Lambert pressing for the deed
in relation to the VCFA loan account (i.e., the
First Deed) to be countersigned
and returned (as the auditors had completed the audit but were refusing to
release the audit sign
off until the deed had been returned).
Poulos responded to Mr Kerridge’s request that same day. Relevantly, as
the primary judge noted at [94] and as the appellants
here emphasise, the terms
of this email were drafted by Mr Lambert (see his email sent to Mr Poulos at
2.02pm that day). Mr Lambert’s
draft was as follows:
As already discussed we are not prepared to sign the loan agremment [sic]. The
$1.3M was never a loan it was an advance that Jim
provided to VCFA to build up
the various VCFA projects that were being developed to add diversification to
AGT to ensure a successful
float. There was never an agreement for repayment.
AGT would benefit from the upside that they would receive from vending in these
projects and would recoup these funds as a result of the listing. This is why we
went doen [sic] this path in the first place.
Earlier this year Jim asked me as a favour to provide a note confirming that the
$1.3M was a loan to satisfy his fellow directors
and I agreed to help him out.
Following this the advance has morphed in [sic] a loan and the Auditor has
requested we sign off a
loan agreement. Firstly, we provided additional shares
in VCFA as payment for Jim’s $1.3M contribution. In addition to this,
Elias and I decided to allocate shares in DWF and the allocation was generous.
Now you have presented us with a loan agreement which
is for the total amount,
plus interest which becomes repayable whenever AGT calls in the loan agreement.
The agreement takes security
over the DWF shares which you have suggested are
valueless, security over VCFA via a fixed and floating charge and or security
the shares that VCFA purchased in AGH.
The challenge with this is that at the time the shares were purchased in AGH
[sic] for $1.7M the loan agreement was not in existence
for the $1.3m[.], This
was advanced and had nothing to do with the individuals who invested the funds
for the AGH share purchase.
So we cannot secure a loan that we didn’t
disclose (as it was not in existance [sic]) against the shares which VCFA holds
a result of this investment. The same applies to the fixed and floating
charge as the loan did not exist when we took in two of our
chinese partners. So
this leaves the DWF shares which we have allocated to AGT which you consider are
valueless. We do not agree
that the DWF shares have no value, quite the reverse.
text of Mr Poulos’ email to Mr Kerridge largely reproduced the above (with
amendments to refer to “Ross” in
place of “I” in the
text and to correct typographical errors).
was a second deed of acknowledgment of loan signed by each of Mr Jane and
Mr Lambert (Second Deed), this being dated 19 April
2017. VCFA pleaded in its
defence in the 2020 proceedings that Mr Lambert signed the Second Deed at a
meeting in around 2017 that
took place in VCFA’s offices in Chatswood
between Mr Lambert, Mr Jane and Mr Kerridge after Mr Lambert had denied the
indebtedness
recited in the Second Deed and had said that the moneys AGT claimed
to be owed by VCFA constituted risk capital and not debt. Among
other things,
VCFA pleaded that Mr Lambert had said that he was prepared to sign the Second
Deed as an expression of VCFA’s
good faith in completing the float but
that his signature would not constitute effective execution of the Second Deed
and that it
would have to be put to VCFA’s board of directors and formally
approved before it would be entered by VCFA.
Recitals to the Second Deed included (Recital C) that “[t]he sums due as
the Primary Advances as defined in the Deed of
Acknowledgement dated
29th August 2016 [sic] and this further supplemental deed have not been
paid and are due and payable”.
As his Honour noted at [99], there does
not exist any “Deed of Acknowledgement dated 29th August 2016”.
would appear that the parties intended to refer to the First Deed,
dated 30 August 2016.
mid-2018, the directors of Holdings formally resolved, among other things, to
discontinue the proposed listing of the company on
the ASX and to terminate the
Share Sale Agreement between Holdings and the Jane Defendants relating to the
purchase of their shares
in AGT (and “initiate the process under clause
5.9(d) of the AGT Agreement”).
Primary judgment
the purposes of this appeal it is not necessary to summarise the primary
judge’s conclusions on all the issues then in dispute
as the only
challenge by the appellants is to the finding (in respect of the claims in the
2020 proceedings) that the payments totalling
$1.3 million to VCFA represented
loans made by AGT to VCFA (which had the result that the Jane Defendants were
able to set-off the
amount owing by VCFA on the loan, and interest, against the
amounts owing by them to Holdings in relation to the $1.7 million deposit
in August 2016 in relation to the sale of their shares in AGT).
primary judge noted at [20] that the main dispute in the 2020 proceedings was as
to the characterisation of the payments made
to VCFA; at [21] that there was no
document predating the payments which recorded or referred to either an
agreement for services
or an agreement for loan and that each of AGT and VCFA
contended that the agreement which gave rise to the payments was an oral
between Mr Jane of AGT and Mr Lambert of VCFA. His Honour noted at
[26] that neither side suggested that the payments made by AGT
to VCFA were by
way of a gift; and that the argument at trial had proceeded on the basis that
the moneys must have been paid either
pursuant to an agreement for services or
pursuant to a loan agreement; i.e., that one such agreement must have been in
question being which one had been formed.
to the proper characterisation of the invoices, the primary judge noted (at
[29]) that the transactions in question arose out of
conversations between
Mr Jane and Mr Lambert some eight years ago, in circumstances where neither
could recall the specifics of what
was said. His Honour said that it was
necessary to examine the objective contemporaneous documentary evidence,
including the parties’
communications after the time of the alleged
agreement, in order to determine the relative probabilities of the
parties’ respective
positions; and in particular, to determine whether
those communications revealed a common assumption as to the existence and terms
of the agreement between them.
Honour (at [27]) noted the statement of Griffith CJ (O’Connor J agreeing)
Howard Smith & Co Ltd v Varawa
[1907] HCA 38
(1907) 5 CLR 68
Howard Smith
to the effect that statements or conduct after
the date of an alleged agreement that were inconsistent with the existence of a
contract were relevant in determining whether the parties had in fact
concluded an agreement at a particular time.
Honour also noted (at [28])
Johnston v Brightstars Holding Company Pty Ltd
[2014] NSWCA 150
Brightstars
) at [124] where Basten JA (Gleeson JA
agreeing) observed that post-agreement conduct of one party known to the other
and communications
between the parties which reveal a common assumption as to
the existence and terms of an agreement may provide evidence of such agreement
(but that subjective views or reservations of one party, undisclosed to the
other, could not provide a basis for inferring the terms
of a pre-existing
agreement).
appellants do not cavil with his Honour’s statement of principle or the
approach his Honour indicated he would adopt but
they maintain that his Honour
incorrectly applied the principle there stated (see Ground 1).
[30], his Honour set out up front his conclusion that, although there were some
materials that supported VCFA’s contention
(that the moneys were paid as a
fee for service), the evidence overwhelmingly supported the conclusion that the
moneys were loaned
by AGT to VCFA. His Honour then went on to address: from
[31]-[51], the three invoices in question (on which the appellants place
weight); from [52]-[61], communications contemporaneous with the payments; from
[62]-[76], Mr Lambert’s evidence of the
common understanding of the
parties; and then, from [77]-[101], the First Deed and Second Deed.
to the invoices, his Honour accepted that the fact that GST was included in the
invoice and that this was paid by AGT Management
provided some evidence in
support of the contention that services were rendered by VCFA to AGT ([37]).
However, his Honour said that,
as against that was the fact that AGT Management
did not treat any part of the payment made as being for GST in its own accounts.
At [38], his Honour observed that treatment of the payment(s) as “BAS
Excluded” was evidence of a contemporaneous view,
on the part of AGT
Management, that no part of the sum paid represented GST; and said that this was
consistent with the view, also
expressed in the contemporaneous allocations,
that the whole of the amount was paid by way of loan.
Honour pointed out that the descriptions of the work done on the second and
third invoices bore no (or, in the case of the third
invoice, little) relation
to the work that Mr Lambert deposed was the subject of those invoices (see
[41]-[43] in relation to the
second invoice, and [46]-[47] in relation to the
third invoice). His Honour said that Mr Lambert offered no explanation for the
discrepancy
in the description of the work on the second invoice ([43]) and did
not produce any detailed document providing a breakdown of the
amounts charged
on the third invoice nor did he provide any explanation as to why that invoice
wrongly stated that everything except
the amount of GST had already been paid
([47]), nor as to why VCFA did not appear to have chased AGT for the payment of
the outstanding
amount of $20,000 ([49]).
[50] his Honour considered that the fact that the invoices in question provided,
on Mr Lambert’s own evidence, incorrect
information about the work to
which they related and, in relation to the third, the amount which was
outstanding, cast significant
doubt on the reliability of the invoices,
particularly where the anomalies were unexplained.
Honour concluded (see [51]) that the evidence of the invoices and payments made
following the invoices did not reveal a common
assumption by VCFA and AGT as to
the existence and terms of the agreement between them.
Honour next turned to the contemporaneous communications, which his Honour
considered did reveal a common assumption that the
substance of the transactions
was that the moneys paid to VCFA were being advanced as loans ([52]); those
being the 20 November 2015
from Mr Jane (see above at [36]), and the 15 February
2016 email letter from Mr Lambert (see above at [39]).
to the first, his Honour noted that none of the officers of VCFA to whom the
email was addressed disputed the statement that all
of the payments to date
represented advances to VCFA; nor did they assert that the amounts were in fact
paid in relation to services
([55]). As to the second, his Honour said (at [59])
that this letter revealed a common assumption that the payment of $440,000 by
AGT to VCFA represented an advance repayable in full; and was inconsistent with
any common assumption that the amount had been paid
as a fee for service
rendered by VCFA. His Honour also referred to the treatment of the various
$100,000 payments in the accounts
of AGT Management as referable to loans (at
[56] and [61]).
to Mr Lambert’s evidence in his affidavit to the effect that Mr Jane had
asked him to say that the money had been loaned
to VCFA (when each of them knew
this to be not true) in order to deceive Mr Jane’s fellow directors of
AGT, the primary judge
noted that it was not suggested to Mr Jane in
cross-examination that he had any intention to deceive his fellow directors or
he had knowingly created a false document in order to do so ([63]) and his
Honour (finding Mr Jane to be an honest witness) rejected
allegation.
Honour also referred to a number of concessions made by Mr Lambert in
cross-examination, which he said were inconsistent with
Mr Lambert’s
affidavit evidence, the most significant of which in his Honour’s opinion
concerned the Loan Acknowledgement,
including that Mr Lambert believed it to be
true at the time he signed it; and that, as far as Mr Lambert could tell, Mr
Jane believed
that the moneys had been paid by way of a loan ([69]). His Honour
said that those concessions were directly inconsistent with Mr
evidence that he and Mr Jane in fact believed the opposite to be true and that
documents acknowledging the loan were
produced at Mr Jane’s request
Honour referred to other matters which Mr Lambert accepted in cross-examination
that his Honour considered were consistent with
the terms of the Loan
Acknowledgement (see at [71]-[73]), relating to the financial documents prepared
by VCFA’s accountant.
Honour found implausible Mr Lambert’s explanation for the inconsistency
between his affidavit evidence and his evidence
in cross-examination (see at
[74]-[75]). His Honour attached significance to the fact that the treatment of
the payments in VCFA’s
own accounts was consistent with the treatment of
the same payments in the accounts of AGT and AGT Management (which allocated all
the payments to loan accounts without any element of GST) and said that the
consistency of those entries across the two sets of accounts
was at odds with Mr
Lambert’s evidence that the documents describing the payments as a loan
were created solely for the purpose
of deceiving Mr Jane’s fellow
directors of AGT ([76]). His Honour said that the more likely explanation
(supported by the contemporaneous
communications and the treatment of the
payments in both companies’ records, as well as Mr Jane’s own
evidence) was that
the payments were made by way of loan; and that both
companies understood this to be the case ([76]).
primary judge then turned to consider the two deeds that had been signed (from
[77]), concluding that the First Deed was significant
primarily because it
revealed a common assumption on the part of AGT and VCFA (and, in particular,
the only officers of those companies
involved in the relevant transaction) that
there existed an agreement between them that VCFA would repay in full the amount
million which had been advanced by AGT to VCFA, together with interest
from the date of the payment ([92]); and noting, as to the
Second Deed, Mr
Lambert’s agreement in cross-examination that when he signed the document
it was because he accepted that its
contents were true ([100]).
considering the import of the First Deed, his Honour referred to the
14 September 2016 email to Mr Kerridge from Mr Poulos. At
[94], his Honour
said that the terms of this email (which his Honour noted had been drafted by Mr
Lambert) were significant. His
Honour said that the email did not dispute that
the moneys were paid by way of advances from AGT to VCFA but disputed the
that AGT be able to call for repayment of the advances prior to the
float being completed. His Honour extracted the text of this
email, emphasising
(among other things) the references in the email to the moneys being “an
advance”; that there was
“never an agreement for repayment”;
and that there was never any intention “to turn the advance into a
His Honour at [95] said that the language of the email was confused
particularly insofar as it stated that the “advances”
[102], his Honour found that: the amount of $1.3 million was advanced by AGT to
VCFA; interest accrued on that loan at the rate
of 10% from the date of each
advance; and no amount had been repaid by VCFA in respect of the principal or
interest on the loan.
That, however, did not lead to the conclusion that AGT was
entitled to an order for repayment of the full amount of the loan and
thereon (because of the operation of the set-off provided for by
cl 5.9(d)(ii) of the Share Sale Agreement – as to
the interpretation
and application of which the parties were agreed, as noted at [267]).
conclusion ultimately reached, that the claim made by Holdings for repayment of
the $1.7m deposit must fail ([269]), followed
from the conclusion that the
amount payable by VCFA to AGT in respect of the $1.3 million loan funds exceeded
the amount of the deposit
at the time it fell due for repayment under cl 5.9(d)
of the Share Sale Agreement – i.e., 17 July 2019 ([268]); not, I
because the Jane Defendants would have had no liability to repay the
deposit absent the applicable set-off. I only emphasise this
because it is of
some relevance when considering the cross-appeal as to costs.
is also relevant to note that, in the course of the reasons, his Honour made
various findings as to the credibility of the principal
witnesses (Mr Lambert
and Mr Jane). In the case of Mr Lambert, for example, his Honour noted at [64]
that Mr Lambert made various
concessions in cross-examination that were
inconsistent with his affidavit evidence and his Honour considered that various
explanations given by Mr Lambert lacked credibility or were implausible
(see at [68] in respect of Mr Lambert’s explanation
for the reason that he
sent the Loan Acknowledgement to AGT and at [75] in respect of Mr
Lambert’s explanation as to why he
allocated the amounts paid to VCFA as
loans in the accounts). By contrast, his Honour accepted Mr Jane as an honest
witness who directly
answered questions and whose evidence was consistent with
contemporaneous documents (see at [63]).
Additional factual
findings sought by appellants
I address those of the appeal grounds in the consolidated notice of appeal which
remain pressed by the appellants, it is relevant
to note the additional findings
of fact for which the appellants contend, as set out in the revised r 51.36(2)
statement annexed
to their submissions in reply. Those, with transcript and
evidentiary references, are that:
(a) VCFA’s employee, Ms Leonie Phillips, used
accounting software to issue VCFA’s invoices 1, 2 and 3.
Soon afterwards the subscription for
lapsed. When later Ms
Philllips was asked by Mr Lambert to locate those invoices, she was unable to do
[so] until late 2021 when
she remembered those invoices were generated using
, the lapsed subscription was renewed, and she retrieved those
invoices: Blue 1/375A-361J, Black 119Q-Z
(b) Mr Lambert asked Ms Phillips to locate invoices 1, 2, 3,
but she was unable to do [so] (until late 2021). So, at the time these
statements were prepared, in the absence of the invoices, there was no evidence
of income. The $1.3 million had to be recorded
as either income or a loan. So,
until the invoices were found in 2021, a selection of records wrongly reflected
that the $1.3 million
was a loan. The records were later amended by way of
correcting the allocation of the $1.3 million: Blue 1/357A-361J, Black 119Q-Z,
430-434, Black 65D-J
(c) AGT Management is a company related to AGT: Blue 1/270K.
(d) AGT’s accounts were prepared on an accruals basis:
Black 160R-161R.
here, the significance attributed by the appellants to the factual findings
contended for in (a) and (b) above was not altogether
clear. Reliance initially
seemed to be placed by the appellants on Ms Leonie Phillips’ evidence as
to the “lost”
invoices as relevant to the assessment by the primary
judge of Mr Lambert’s credibility, the appellants complaining that,
finding (at [68]) that Mr Lambert’s explanation for sending the
Loan Acknowledgement lacked credibility, his Honour did not
have regard to the
unchallenged evidence from Ms Phillips as to her not being able to find the
invoices (see at AT 22.25-29). However,
in response to the respondents’
argument that the mere fact that the invoices were not able to be accessed and
were not found
until December 2021 did not amount to undisputed or
incontrovertible facts that would tell against his Honour’s finding (i.e.,
that there was no
Fox v Percy
(2003) 214 CLR 118
[2003] HCA 22
) error in this regard) (see AT 34.25-29), the appellants’
response was that the “lost invoice chronology” did not
advance the
determination of the issues much further or at all, in circumstances where at
least the bookkeeper’s evidence was
that they were lost (see AT 44.43).
The appellants appeared in this context to assert that no
Fox v Percy
issues arise on the appeal, characterising their appeal as one that engaged (as
his Honour did) with the objective contemporaneous
documents (see at AT 44.40).
It may be that in the absence of a challenge to the finding as to Mr
Lambert’s evidence of the
common intention of the parties, these
additional factual findings would go nowhere.
to the remaining factual findings that are sought (see (c) and (d)), there was
no dispute that AGT Management was related to AGT;
nor did there seem to be any
dispute that AGT’s accounts were prepared on an accruals basis (the
respondents accepting in their
submissions that it was established in
cross-examination that AGT was conducting its affairs on an accruals
significance of those matters on the appellants’ case (apart from Ground
13 which was not ultimately pressed) seemed to
be as to the weight to be
attached to the fact that AGT Management did not record any part of the relevant
payments in its accounts
as being for GST (see [37] of the primary judgment, for
example, in relation to the payment of $660,000). The appellants say that
would be unremarkable on an intercompany loan (i.e., as between AGT Management
and AGT) (see AT 9). Although the appellants
concede that there would be a
recording for GST in the accounts “somewhere” if GST was payable,
they argue that, absent
evidence from the respondents as to AGT/AGT
Management’s internal accounting treatment of such payments (and whether
the accounts
were consolidated), the fact that the invoices included GST for
services is consistent with their case and they say that there is
internally in the documents that conclusively establishes to the contrary (see
at AT 10.29ff). I consider his Honour’s
treatment of the internal
accounting records in the context of Grounds 2-6.
turn then to the grounds of appeal under the headings set out in the
consolidated notice of appeal. The nub of the appellants’
complaint is
their contention that his Honour paid insufficient weight to the three invoices
and had undue regard to the contradictory
material after the commercial
arrangements between the parties started to “fray” (see AT 4). The
appellants did not press
Grounds 13-17 of the consolidated notice of appeal (see
Ground 1 – Misapplication of the correct legal principle
1. The court below erred in misapplying the correct legal
principle when finding that the evidence overwhelmingly supported the
that the moneys at issue were loaned by the fifth respondent to the second
appellant instead of being payment for the
second appellant’s services,
the legal principle being that the terms of an agreement may be evidenced by
communications between
the parties of a common assumption but not by the
undisclosed views of one of them.
to Ground 1, the appellants contend that his Honour erred in the application of
correct legal principle in three ways: by treating
communications as private
conduct; by treating private conduct as communications; and by interpreting
communications to find common
assumptions in circumstances where the appellants
argue that no common assumptions emerge from a fair objective reading of the
correspondence.
The appellants rely, in support of this contention, on the
errors contended for in Grounds 2-6, which I consider next. However,
substance, the complaint is that his Honour treated AGT Management’s
internal accounting records as evidence of a common
assumption between the
parties that the payments were a loan, whereas the correct legal principle is
that subjective views or reservations
of one party, undisclosed to the other,
cannot provide a basis for inferring the terms of a pre-existing agreement (see
Brightstars
as cited above at [65]); and that his Honour did not treat
the issue and payment of the invoices as a communication between the parties
that evidenced the agreement between them as one for the supply of
respondents cavil with the appellants’ suggestion that this is an appeal
in which there was a misapplication of legal principle
to uncontroverted facts.
Rather, the respondents argue that the primary judge’s decision was
substantially affected by his
Honour’s assessment of the credibility of
Mr Lambert in deciding which of the competing versions of the alleged
agreement was
correct; and they say that the appellants have not identified (in
their grounds of appeal or in their submissions) any error in the
judge’s findings capable of surmounting the hurdle identified in
at [29]-[31] (as to which, I note again that the position of the
appellants in oral submissions (at AT 10) was that no
Fox v Percy
here arise).
reply submissions, the appellants maintain that the credit of a single witness
(whether Mr Lambert or Mr Jane) cannot affect an
examination of the objective
contemporaneous documentary evidence where, as here, neither the provenance nor
the authenticity of
the objective contemporaneous documentary evidence was in
dispute. The appellants also say that, while the primary judge did not
and/or found implausible aspects of Mr Lambert’s evidence, there was no
blanket finding rejecting his evidence generally.
the reasons given in relation to Grounds 2-6 below, I do not accept that the
primary judge erred in the application of correct
legal principle. Rather, to
the extent that his Honour referred to private uncommunicated views as to the
proper characterisation
of the payments (such as were reflected in AGT
Management’s internal accounts), this is fairly to be understood as being
the context of exploring whether there was conduct by the respondents that
was inconsistent with their assertion in the proceedings
that the payments were
a loan. As to the weight to be attributed to the specification in the invoices
of a GST component, this had
to be seen in the context of all the evidence,
including the lack of records of work done for which the invoices were
purportedly
rendered and Mr Lambert’s own acknowledgement of the
my opinion Ground 1 is not made good.
Grounds 2-6 – The respondent’s internal accounts
2. The court below erred in holding that the fact of the fifth
respondent [AGT Management] not treating any part of the payments
it made to the
second appellant [VCFA] as including GST in the fifth respondent’s own
accounts was evidence of communications
between the parties of a common
assumption.
3. The court below should have held that the fact of the fifth
respondent not treating any part of the payments it made to the
second appellant
as being for GST in the fifth respondent’s own accounts represented the
undisclosed and personal view of the
fifth respondent.
4. The court below should have held the fact that the second
appellant’s tax invoices explicitly noted a charge for GST and
respondent paid those invoices in full (including the amount charged for GST),
was a communication between the parties
evidencing the agreement between them
was one for the second appellant to provide services to the fifth respondent,
because providing
those services was a taxable supply incurring GST and loaning
money was not a taxable supply and did not incur GST.
5. The court below erred in holding that the fact of the fifth
respondent entering in its own accounts allocations describing the
payments it
made as “Loan-Ross Lambert” and “Loan-Access Group Training
Pty Ltd”, disclosed a common assumption
that the moneys at issue were
loaned instead of being payment for services.
6. The court below should have held that the fact of the fifth
respondent describing the payments it made in its own accounts represented
undisclosed and personal view of the fifth respondent.
Appellants’ submissions
appellants complain that the primary judge’s reasons (at [37]) conflate
the two different companies (AGT and AGT Management).
In that regard, the
appellants take issue with the statement that AGT Management did not treat any
part of the payment for the first
invoice as being for GST in its own accounts.
The appellants place emphasis here on the evidence that AGT incurred an
intercompany
liability to AGT Management in respect of the whole of the payments
(totalling $1,300,035). As noted above, the appellants argue
that in this
context the fact that there was no entry for GST in the accounts of AGT
Management is not inconsistent with the appellants’
case that the payments
were for services.
appellants, referring to Ms Pearce’s affidavit and oral evidence, contend
that AGT Management’s internal accounting
records do not evidence that AGT
treated the $660,000 paid on 4 August 2015 as a loan to VCFA; rather, they argue
that any loan was
for $600,035 and was a loan between AGT as debtor and AGT
Management as creditor. In this regard, the appellants say that the change
August 2016 to the relevant entry for the first invoice, recording $660,035
against the ledger corresponding to a loan to AGT,
was a simple correction to
the ledger and they point to the acceptance by his Honour of
Mr Jane’s evidence that AGT incurred
an intercompany liability to AGT
Management.
any event, as adverted to above, the appellants argue that the use of internal
accounting records to reason as the primary judge
did falls outside the
principles in
Howard Smith
(which they say concern inconsistent conduct,
not consistent conduct). The appellants argue that “self-serving”
records consistent with a party’s subjective belief cannot
legitimately be used to determine whether, objectively, the parties
had in fact
concluded an agreement at a particular time.
appellants similarly complain as to the reasoning at [38] (having regard to Mr
Jane’s evidence that if the invoices were
bona fide and payable it would
have been AGT’s normal business practice to claim a GST credit) that
treatment of the entirety
of the first payment as “BAS Excluded” was
evidence of a contemporaneous view on AGT Management’s part that none
that payment represented GST. The appellants maintain that, at its highest, this
amounts to a finding that AGT usually conducted
itself consistently with its
“own, self-serving, practice”. The same criticism is made in
relation to the findings in
respect of the second and third invoices.
to the second invoice, the appellants also cavil with any weight being placed on
the fact that Mr Lambert’s evidence (in
2023) about the work done was in
different terms to that described on the invoice in 2015, arguing the difference
is unremarkable
given the lapse of time; and they complain that Mr Lambert was
not challenged that his evidence in his affidavit was anything other
elaboration on the “opaque” words printed on the invoice “IPO
Respondents’ submissions
respondents say that it is incorrect for the appellants to assert (as they do at
[13] of their written submissions) that Mr Lambert
“unchallenged” evidence about the work done, the issue of invoices,
and their payment. The respondents note that
Mr Lambert was cross-examined as to
the veracity of his assertion that the payments were made in answer to the
invoices rather than
as the receipt of a loan; and that it was put to him that
there was no agreement between VCFA and AGT which would have entitled VCFA
issue invoices, no hourly rate for the provision of services by VCFA to AGT, and
no documentation by AGT acknowledging those invoices.
to the appellants’ criticism of the primary judge’s treatment of
payments made by AGT Management to VCFA (and their
assertion that they should be
interpreted as giving rise to an intercompany liability to AGT Management on the
part of AGT, rather
than a loan to VCFA), the respondents point out that AGT
Management was a vehicle used by AGT to make payments on its behalf and
Jane explained that it was AGT that in reality lent the money to VCFA. The
respondents note that the loan acknowledgements
issued by Mr Lambert
treated payments made by AGT Management as payments made by AGT; and that the
internal records of AGT Management
and AGT also treated the payments as such.
The respondents say that the primary judge’s treatment of the invoices is
unsurprising
in light of his conclusions as to the accuracy of the accounts
given by Mr Lambert and Mr Jane.
to the appellants’ complaint that the evidence of the internal recordings
of AGT and AGT Management concerning the payments
should not have been treated
as evidence of a common assumption between the parties, the respondents say that
this ignores his Honour’s
clear statement (at [51]) that he did not find
that the evidence in the internal accounting records regarding the invoices and
payments “reveal[ed] a common assumption”, contrasting this (at
[52]) with the position in relation to the communications
between the parties in
November 2015 and February 2016 which his Honour did consider revealed a common
assumption as to the payments
respondents argue that, to the extent that his Honour treated the internal
accounts of the parties as relevant, he did not do
so as evidence of a common
assumption; instead, they maintain that his Honour treated them as
contemporaneous and relevant documents
from which inferences could be drawn or
conclusions made as to the reliability of the competing versions of events.
to the contention in Ground 4 that the primary judge should have held that the
GST notation in the invoices, and payment thereof,
amounted to a communication
between the parties evidencing an agreement to provide services, the respondents
note that the primary
judge accepted that possibility (referring to the
observation by his Honour at [37] that the inclusion of GST in the invoice
some evidence in support of the contention that services were rendered
by VCFA to AGT) but then went on to refer to the fact that
AGT did not claim any
input credit for the GST amounts included on the invoices as evidence of a
contemporaneous view on the part
of AGT Management that was consistent with the
view expressed in the contemporaneous allocations that the whole of the amount
was by way of loan ([38]).
respondents point to his Honour’s findings that the invoices themselves
were unreliable documents which described work different
from the work for which
Mr Lambert claimed they had been issued and which contained unexplained
anomalies ([50]) and that the GST
component of the third invoice was never paid
or chased by VCFA ([49]). The respondents also note that the finding as to the
contradictory
evidence of Mr Lambert as to the work done is not the subject of
any ground of appeal.
Reply submissions
their reply submissions, the appellants emphasise the evidence of Ms Phillips as
to the invoices that were issued and her inability
to locate copies of them
(when requested by Mr Lambert to do so) until late 2021 because of the lapse of
VCFA’s subscription
accounting software; it being
submitted that, until the invoices were found in 2021, a selection of records
wrongly reflected that
the $1.3 million was a loan. Complaint is made that the
primary judge made no reference to Ms Phillips’ evidence, even when
finding that Mr Lambert’s evidence about “the accounts
was implausible.
is placed on that evidence as countering the emphasis placed by the respondents
on the fact that VCFA’s records failed
to record the $1.3 million as
income and on Mr Lambert’s evidence as to his confidence that VCFA’s
financial statements
were correct when he signed

made clear in addressing the invoices rendered and source of the payment of
those invoices that he understood that they
were different (though related)
companies (see at [32], [37] and [44] for example). The evidence that there was
an intercompany loan
as between AGT and AGT Management in respect of the
payments made by the latter to VCFA does not detract from the characterisation
of the payments to VCFA being by way of loan and the fact that no input credit
was claimed for GST in the internal accounts of AGT
Management supports the
conclusion that his Honour drew at [38] that this was consistent (and I would
emphasise not inconsistent)
with the view expressed in the contemporaneous
allocations that the whole of the amounts were paid by way of loan. As noted
the discussion was in any event merely a step on the way to
unexceptionable conclusions drawn at [50] and [51].
also do not accept the criticisms here made of the primary judge’s
reasoning in relation to the internal accounting records
of AGT Management as to
the invoices in question. What is clear from his Honour’s recitation of
the applicable principles (with
which the appellants do not cavil) was that his
Honour was considering the treatment of the amounts paid in the internal records
of AGT/AGT Management in order to see whether (consistently with the principles
Howard Smith
) that treatment was inconsistent with AGT’s
contention that the amounts were paid by way of loan – his Honour
in effect that the internal accounting records were not inconsistent
(by reason of the fact that no GST input credit was claimed)
with the view on
the part of AGT Management that the amount was paid by way of a loan.
other words, the primary judge did not impermissibly treat these as evidence of
communication between the parties of a common assumption
(cf Ground 2); nor did
his Honour treat these as other than the undisclosed and personal views of the
respondents (cf Ground 3).
Rather, his Honour was quite permissibly testing
whether there was inconsistent conduct on the part of the respondents. Grounds 5
and 6 fail for the same reason.
to Ground 4, his Honour did take into account the fact that the invoices claimed
GST and that they were paid in full, noting that
this was some evidence in
support of the appellants’ contention. However, his Honour was entitled to
take into account, as
against that evidence, the fact that there was
contradictory evidence from Mr Lambert as to the work said to have been done for
the invoices were purportedly rendered and the unexplained anomalies in
relation to those invoices (which went to the reliability
of the invoices) and
that there was no other documentary evidence as to work done in relation to the
invoiced amounts (something
that the appellants conceded on the appeal was
“less than ideal”, though pointing here to the time that had elapsed
the relevant events – see AT 11.8).
appellants emphasise that there was no suggestion at the trial that the invoices
were fraudulent (AT 11.43). However, that does
not address the possibility that
the invoices were simply unreliable (a conclusion that was open to his Honour to
draw, and not demonstrative
of error, having regard to the matters referred to
thus do not accept that his Honour erred in concluding (at [51]) that the
evidence of the invoices and the payments made following
the invoices did not
reveal a common assumption by VCFA and AGT as to the existence and terms of the
agreement between them. His
Honour’s ultimate conclusion as to the
characterisation of the arrangement as being one of loan was, of course, also
by his Honour’s consideration of the contemporaneous
communications between the parties (the subject of Grounds 7-12), to which
2-6 are not made good.
Grounds 7-12 – Correspondence between the parties about the
7-8 relate to the 26 November 2015 email communication from Mr Lambert;
Grounds 9-10 to the 15 February 2016 email letter
from Mr Lambert; and
Grounds 11-12 to the 14 September 2016 communication from Mr Poulos.
25 November 2015
7. The court below erred in holding that the second
appellant’s email sent on 25 November 2015 disclosed a common assumption
that the moneys at issue were loaned instead of being payment for services.
8. The court below should have held that on 20 November 2015,
when the fifth respondent emailed 2 directors of the second appellant
the payments as “loan funds” and, on 25 [sic] November 2015, one
director, Mr Lambert, emailed a reply with
the words “Thanks, Jim”,
the second appellant was merely acknowledging receipt of the 20 November 2015
26 November 2015 email has been extracted above, as has the email to which it
responded (the email dated 20 November 2015 from
Mr Jane) (at [36]-[37]).
appellants complain that the 26 November 2015 email was not put to
Mr Lambert in cross-examination. They argue that, by using
“Thanks, Jim”, Mr Lambert was most likely simply acknowledging
receipt of the 20 November 2015 email; and they
contend that, absent a contrary
suggestion under cross-examination, there was no persuasive reason for his
Honour to take a different
interpretation.
to the primary judge’s reference to the failure by any of the officers of
VCFA to whom the email was addressed to dispute
Mr Jane’s statement that
all of the payments made to date represented advances to VCFA ([55]), the
appellants argue that this
overlooks the email sent on 14 September 2016 in
which Mr Poulos (at Mr Lambert’s direction) did
Jane’s statement and the assertions of a loan more generally. (That email
was considered by the primary judge at
[94]-[95] in the context of addressing
the First Deed.)
appellants maintain that there is nothing confusing about the language used in
the 14 September 2016 correspondence (cf his Honour’s
observation at
[95]), arguing that the words “payment” and “advance”
bear similar meanings in ordinary use
by non-lawyers (and pointing out that
neither Mr Lambert (who drafted the email) nor Mr Poulos (who amended the draft
and then sent
the email) is a lawyer).
respondents contend that the failure of either Mr Lambert or Mr Poulos to
respond to the assertion in the 20 November 2015 email
that the moneys were
advanced as loans was extraordinary, given the appellants’ case that the
payments were fees for services
rendered; and that a failure to dispute such a
characterisation was clearly significant evidence of such a common
assumption.
respondents say that there was no requirement for them to put this email to Mr
Lambert in cross-examination, and that they were
entitled to rely upon the
absence of a challenge by VCFA (referring to
Brightstars
at [72]). The
respondents note that the appellants were aware of the evidence concerning this
email (and AGT’s reliance on it),
as it was an annexure to Mr Jane’s
affidavit sworn 9 September 2022 (see [15] of that affidavit); and they say that
appellants wished to contest the evidence they should have given evidence
cross-examine Mr Jane
not putting propositions to
witnesses concerning actual dishonest conduct) that
they would not take a
Browne v Dunn
[(1893) 6 R 67 (HL)] (
) point generally.
as the appellants rely on the later email dated 14 September 2016 sent by Mr
Poulos as evidence of a challenge to the 26 November
2015 email exchange which
the primary judge overlooked, the respondents note that the 14 September 2016
email was not from Mr Lambert
and was not addressed to Mr Jane; nor was it sent
to anyone at AGT. The respondents also say that the email was not addressed to
the acceptance of the payments as a loan in 2015, pointing out that it was sent
in the context of the First Deed (which Mr Lambert
proceeded to sign).
reply submissions, the appellants discount the delay between Mr Jane’s
20 November 2015 email and the 14 September 2016 correspondence,
that the delay in that correspondence was due to it only being made plain for
the first time, when Mr Jane pressed to have
Mr Lambert and Mr Poulos sign the
First Deed, that Mr Jane was asserting a loan (and that this was met immediately
with loud disagreement,

do not consider that anything turns on this. The
point being made by his Honour at [55] was that there was no contemporaneous
in November 2015 (as might have been expected if the assertion of loan
funds had been disputed at that time) from Mr Lambert disputing
characterisation of the payments as having been “advanced as loan
is the absence of any quarrel at that stage with the description of the payments
as “loan funds” that is significant,
not whether the acknowledgement
went beyond merely the receipt of the email. One would assume that a recipient
acknowledging an email
communication such as the 20 November 2015 email would
ordinarily read the email (although in oral submissions the submission was
without making clear on what basis, that it should be inferred that Mr Lambert
had not read the body of the text – AT
circumstances where there was an appreciable delay between the communications
contemporaneous with the relevant payments and the
14 September 2016 email,
it is not in my opinion fair to the primary judge to criticise him for having
“overlooked” the
14 September 2016 email when considering the import
of the contemporaneous communications. The 14 September 2016 email was sent
a year later and in a different context, namely in response to pressure
for VCFA to countersign the First Deed. What his Honour was
emphasising at [55]
was the lack of a contemporaneous dispute as to the characterisation of the
the suggestion in reply submissions that it was only in September 2016 that it
was made plain that Mr Jane regarded the advances
as a loan cannot be sustained
when reference is made to the text of the 20 November 2015 email, which referred
in terms to the payments
having been advanced as “loan funds”.
see no error in the conclusion that the 20 November 2015 email, insofar as it
did not refer to the suggestion that the payments
represented an agreed fee for
service and did not refer to any invoices, did reveal a common assumption that
the substance of the
transaction was a loan (see [52]).
Grounds 7 and 8 are not made good.
15 February 2016
9. The court below erred in holding that the second
appellant’s email sent on 15 February 2016 disclosed a common assumption
that the moneys at issue were loaned instead of being payment for services.
10. The court below should have held that on 15 February 2016,
when the second appellant’s director emailed the fifth respondent
the second appellant has “been honouring our loan repayments as per our
agreement” and confirmed an amount owing
of $440,000, that correspondence
was not referring to the moneys at issue, because (1) by that date, the second
appellant had invoiced
the respondent $1.1 million, (2) the fifth respondent had
paid the appellant $1.1 million, (3) there was no evidence of any repayment
$660,000, and (4) it was not suggested to any witness called for the appellants
that $660,000 had been repaid.
9 and 10 relate to the email letter dated 15 February 2016 from Mr Lambert
to Mr Jane, on VCFA letterhead stating that “we
have been honouring our
loan repayments as per our agreement and confirm the following loan repayment
appellants complain that, although his Honour noted (at [60]) that the
suggestion in the letter that loan repayments had been
made prior to the date of
the letter was incorrect, his Honour did not explain why that, and the other
inaccuracies that Mr Jane
conceded in cross-examination, made no difference to
the outcome.
appellants note that Holdings submitted at first instance that, whatever loan
was being acknowledged by that correspondence, it
differed materially from the
alleged $1.3 million loan. The appellants say that, absent cross-examination of
Mr Lambert on this correspondence,
this is a sensible way to account for his
reference to “loan repayments” when none had been made, pointing
also to concessions
to similar effect under cross-examination by Mr Jane. The
appellants thus contend that his Honour should have held that this
correspondence
was not referring to the moneys at issue in the proceedings.
respondents say that it was never the appellants’ case that some other
loan was due and payable from VCFA to AGT; and they
complain about the
appellants’ attempt to portray this correspondence as suggesting some
other, unrelated, loan between the
respondents argue that the importance of the 15 February 2016 letter, from the
primary judge’s perspective (see at [59]),
was that it confirmed the loan
of the $440,000 payment to VCFA on 24 September 2015; and they
point out that the incorrect assertion that repayments had been made
made by Mr Lambert, not AGT. The respondents say that this letter is wholly
inconsistent with the appellants’ case
(of a fee for service). They note
that the letter being addressed to AGT was in fact accurate in that the $440,000
payment was the
only one made (directly) by AGT (as opposed to AGT Management)
at that date.
respondents maintain that there was no obligation on AGT to cross-examine Mr
Lambert about his error in referring to repayments;
and that the relevance of
the letter was that AGT accepted Mr Lambert’s assumption of a loan. The
respondents also emphasise
that the appellants make no challenge to the findings
made by the primary judge concerning the Loan Acknowledgement that was signed
both Mr Jane and Mr Lambert, recording the payments to VCFA as loans.
reply submissions, the appellants say that the respondents’ submission as
to the coincidence of the amount of $440,000 referred
to in the 15 February 2016
letter with one tranche of the $1.3 million overlooks that the primary judge
found that AGT’s case
was that the total $1.3 million was either payment
for services or a loan, not that each separate tranche might be one or the
a finding that they note is not challenged on appeal. (I note that in
the first of those references, the primary judge uses the
plural (“payment
for services
whereas in the latter, his Honour uses the singular but it is not apparent that
anything turns on this difference in his
Honour’s reasons.)
appellants point to Mr Jane’s evidence in cross-examination asserting that
there was correspondence (not in evidence) between
him and AGT’s internal
accountant, Mr Michael McGahan, on this issue but conceding that Mr McGahan
could have been called to
give evidence; and Mr Jane’s concession that,
whatever that letter was acknowledging, it was not
acknowledging any
obligation to repay either the $660,000 or the $180,000 deposited into
VCFA’s bank account by AGT Management.
appellants also seem to suggest that the reference in the 14 September 2016
email (see above) to Mr Jane having asked Mr Lambert
earlier that year “as
a favour to provide a note confirming that the $1.3M was a loan to satisfy his
fellow directors”
was to the February 2016 letter (though it might be more
plausible that this would be a reference to the Loan Acknowledgement signed
around the time that the year’s end financial statements were being
appellants submit that the primary judge was left with an incomplete picture of
the financial dealings between AGT and VCFA caused
entirely by AGT choosing
neither to put into evidence all emails about the financial dealings nor the
respondents’ internal
accountant. In that context, and absent concessions
under cross-examination by Mr Lambert, the appellants say that an objective
examination
of the 15 February 2016 letter results in the conclusion that this
is not consistent with the respondents’ case.
Determination
to the appellants’ complaint that his Honour did not explain why the
incorrect statement in the 15 February 2016 letter (or
any inaccuracies conceded
by Mr Jane) made no difference to the outcome, I see no reason why it was
incumbent on the primary judge
to do more than note the incorrect statement
(about which there was no dispute).
is because what was relevant was that the February 2016 letter, whatever else
might be said about it, revealed an assumption
that there was an amount owing,
as at 31 December 2015, of $440,000 and did not make any reference to an amount
payable by way of
a fee for service. The amount of $440,000 corresponded exactly
to the amount that had been paid directly by AGT to VCFA in September
Therefore, the incorrect assertion that loan repayments had been made to that
date (whether or not it may have referred to
some other unidentified loan or
loans) does not alter the fact that the letter is inconsistent with the $440,000
having been paid
as a fee for service. The suggestion that nothing can be made
of the coincidence in the sum of $440,000 there being said to be owing,
the case put by the parties was that there was only a binary outcome (the whole
sum being a loan or the whole sum being a
fee for service), does not in my
opinion pay sufficient regard to the fact that the sum “advanced”
was indisputably paid
in tranches; and hence acknowledgement of a loan owing in
relation to the $440,000 is not inconsistent with the claim for a $1.3
loan in total.
to the complaint that AGT did not put all emails about the companies’
financial dealings into evidence, the Court was not
taken to any material to
sustain such a complaint; nor was any
Jones v Dunkel
101 CLR 298
[1959] HCA 8]
issue in relation to Mr McGahan the subject of the appeal grounds.
On the material before the primary judge, his Honour did not err
in concluding
that the 15 February 2016 letter was one (amongst a number of) matter(s) that
together led to the conclusion that it
was more likely than not that the
payments were advanced as loan funds.
9 and 10 are therefore not made good.
14 September 2016
11. The court below erred in holding that the second
appellant’s email sent on 14 September 2016 disclosed a common assumption
that the moneys at issue were loaned instead of being payment for services.
12. The court below should have held that on 14 September 2016,
when the second appellant’s director Mr Poulos emailed the
respondent to say the moneys at issue were “never a loan”, and Mr
Poulos stated reasons for his conclusion, that
email evidenced the second
appellant disputing the moneys at issue were anything other than payment for
11 and 12 relate to the 14 September 2016 email. This was not referred to by the
primary judge in the section of his reasons
dealing with communications
contemporaneous with the payments (understandably as it was not contemporaneous
with them). It was, however,
considered by the primary judge when dealing with
the First Deed (as noted above).
Relevantly,
his Honour referred to the 14 September 2016 email in the context of his
statement (at [92]) that the First Deed was primarily
significant because it
revealed a common assumption on the part of the only officers of AGT and VCFA
who were involved in the relevant
transaction that there existed an agreement
between them that VCFA would repay in full the amount of $1.3 million which
advanced, with interest; and (at [93]) that whether Mr Poulos was of a
different view was of little consequence as his only source
of knowledge about
the transactions was what Mr Lambert had told him.
appellants emphasise that Mr Lambert had drafted the substance of the email sent
by Mr Poulos. They maintain that the language
of the 14 September 2016 email
should be read as disputing that the moneys were a loan, reading the word
“advance” as
being a reference to a “payment”, not a
loan. They maintain that this was evidence of VCFA disputing that the moneys
were other than payment for services.
respondents point out (as noted earlier) that the email was sent to
Mr Kerridge and copied to addressees at VCFA email addresses;
and not sent
to Mr Jane, nor any staff member of AGT. The respondents say that the contents
of the email are inconsistent with the
sum of $1.3 million being payment for
services rendered, pointing to the description of the payments in that email as
an “advance”
and the reference to the advance having been provided
to “build the various VCFA AGT projects that were being developed to
diversification to AGT to ensure a successful float” and the statement
that AGT would “recoup those funds as a result
of the listing”.
respondents note that the primary judge discounted this email because
Mr Poulos admitted that his only source of knowledge about
the relevant
transactions was what Mr Lambert had told him; and that this was undermined by
the earlier evidence of a common assumption
and the fact that (despite cavilling
14 September 2016 email)
Mr Lambert signed the First Deed knowing that it
was required by the auditors and would be used as public information for the IPO
prospectus. The respondents note that the appellants do not challenge these
respondents say that this was a further instance of the primary judge rejecting
the reliability of Mr Lambert’s evidence.
The respondents argue that the
14 September 2016 email (and the appellants’ contention as to the meaning
of the word “advanced”
in that email) does not provide
incontrovertible evidence or compelling inferences against the primary
judge’s assessment of
the email and the evidence of Messrs Poulos and
Lambert concerning it.
reply submissions, the appellants say that they now do not challenge that his
Honour correctly identified and accepted Mr Lambert’s
evidence that the
First Deed was produced at the behest of Mr Mark Nicholaeff (the auditor),
despite AGT not being a person who had
loaned money to VCFA. (If this is a
reference to the matters set out by his Honour at [67]-[69], then it should be
noted that in
those paragraphs of his Honour’s reasons his Honour was
referring to the Loan Acknowledgement, not the First Deed.) Insofar
appellants seem to suggest that the primary judge accepted Mr Lambert’s
evidence that he believed the First Deed to
be inaccurate but could not prove it
with the invoices as they had been temporarily misplaced, that does not accord
with his Honour’s
analysis of Mr Lambert’s evidence as to the Loan
Acknowledgement, financial statements and First Deed (see from [65]-[97]).
appellants reiterate the emphasis placed by them on Ms Phillips’ evidence,
which they say his Honour’s reasoning (when
rejecting Mr Lambert’s
explanation in relation to the internal records of the company and the First
Deed) ignored; and they
maintain that, whatever the source and extent of
Mr Poulos’ knowledge about the $1.3 million, he had orally disputed
meeting with Mr Jane and Mr Kerridge in September 2016 that the money was

true at the time he signed it, the

the circumstances
in which he signed the
Determination
my opinion, there is no error disclosed in relation to the findings in respect
of the 14 September 2016 email. The statement that
the $1.3 million was never a
loan “as it was an advance ... provided to build the various VCFA/AGT
projects that were being
developed to add diversification to AGT to ensure a
successful float” does in terms deny the existence of a loan but the point
being made in the balance of the first paragraph of the email extracted at [94]
of his Honour’s reasons was that there was
“never an agreement for
repayment” and that the general understanding was that these funds would
be recouped as a result
of the listing. There was no suggestion at all that the
“advance” as so described was payment for services rendered (a
matter to which his Honour understandably attached significance [95]).
the scope for confusion in the language of the email which his Honour identified
related to the concept of an “advance”
that was not the subject of
an agreement for repayment but was to be recouped as a loan. In my opinion, his
Honour correctly understood
this email to be disputing the intention that AGT
would be able to call for repayment of the “advance” prior to
of the float; and correctly rejected the proposition that this
revealed an understanding that the moneys advanced were fees for services.
a non-lawyer might use the word “advance” as a synonym for
“payment” misses the point in my opinion.
Non-lawyers presumably may
also use “advance” as a synonym for “loan”. The
statement that the $1.3 million
“was never a loan as it was an
advance” is certainly capable of giving rise to confusion, and of bearing
the meaning
ascribed to it by the primary judge; and the appellants’
submission does not grapple with the primary judge’s observation
nothing in the email suggests that the “advances” represented
payment of a fee for services provided by VCFA to
reliance placed by the appellants in reply submissions on the circumstances in
which the First Deed was signed does not take the
matter further. The position,
on Mr Lambert’s own evidence, appears to be that he was prepared to sign
documents in order not
to hold up the IPO and where he knew the auditors would
be relying on them, believing at the time he signed them that they were true
(but only because he did not have the invoices to prove otherwise). Such an
explanation lacks credulity, even accepting that the
invoices were not available
to Mr Lambert at the time.
11 and 12 are not made good.
Conclusion as to appeal
the above reasons I would dismiss the appeal. There is thus no need to address
the submissions made by the respondents as to the
“false ghost of the 2019
proceedings” (i.e., the submission that order 3(b) in the amended notice
of appeal is anomalous
and opposed even if the appeal in the 2020 proceedings
were to succeed). As to the costs of the appeal, I see no reason why costs
should not follow the event.
Cross-Appeal
noted, the cross-appellants now only press Ground 2 in the respective
cross-appeals, in relation to the costs order made by the
primary judge that
each party bear its own costs. Ground 2 contends that:
The court below erred in failing to find that the Respondents had been
successful, and so ought to be entitled to its costs of the
proceedings.
cross-respondents, having raised with the cross-appellants on 11 June 2024 the
question of competency of the cross-appeal, filed
a notice of motion to dismiss
the cross-appeal for want of competence when no cross-summons seeking leave to
appeal had been filed.
This was listed at the same time as the
appeal/cross-appeal.
is accepted by the cross-appellants that leave to cross-appeal is necessary as
the cross-appeal is now restricted to costs (in
this regard see the analysis by
Leeming JA in
Housman v Camuglia
at [43]-[84]). The cross-appellants
submit that leave should be granted as the issue they seek to raise (challenging
the primary
judge’s departure from the usual approach that costs follow
the event) is of relevance beyond their own cross-appeal. They
argue that such a
departure is a significant matter requiring consideration of the legal
principles underlying that approach; and
that it should not be made lightly. It
is submitted that for costs to be too readily apportioned would be contrary to
the principles
Oshlack v Richmond River Council
(1998) 193 CLR 72

Firebird Global Master Fund II Ltd v
Republic of Nauru (No 2)
(2015) 90 ALJR 270
[2015] HCA 53
); and that the need for careful consideration of those
principles should be re-emphasised.
cross-appellants also submit that regard should be had to the unusual way in
which they have come to find themselves requiring
leave. It is noted that the
cross-appeals did not begin as appeals only on costs; rather, as many of the
issues pressed by the appellants
have fallen away, so has one claim by the
cross-appellants. The cross-appellants say that as submissions have already been
and costs incurred, on the assumption that the arguments contained in
the cross-appeal would be considered, there can be no prejudice
appellants by a granting of leave to prosecute the cross-appeal.
cross-respondents oppose the grant of leave. The cross-respondents say that
there was no error of the
House v The King
(1936) 55 CLR 499
House v The King
be refused as the questions involved turn on the precise facts determined below
no wider application beyond the parties themselves.
cross-appellants argue that the issue is “not without general
importance” on the basis that if the court too easily
assumes that where
proceedings concern multiple issues that the result is “mixed”,
without assessing the practical outcome
and “event”, the question of
costs can elide the jurisdiction into a “no costs” jurisdiction too
deprive the successful party of its costs because it had claims, or
raised issues, which were rejected.
considering the application for leave to cross-appeal, it is convenient first to
consider the substance of the proposed appeal
from the primary judge’s
costs orders.
Costs judgment
primary judge in his brief costs judgment on the papers ordered that each set of
parties bear its own costs of both proceedings.
support of that conclusion, the primary judge noted that the following elements
of the cross-appellants’ case had not been
successful: that AGT had been
entitled to recover its loan to VCFA in full; that VCFA’s debt was
comprised of additional amounts
due to rent and outgoings; and that further
amounts claimed to be owing by Holdings to AGT in respect of IPO costs should be
against Holdings’ claim.
final orders were made, the primary judge accepted a submission by the
cross-respondents (by reference to
In the matter of Fewin Pty Ltd
NSWSC 1093)
that it was appropriate that there be declarations regarding the
amounts owing at the relevant date and the effect of the contractual
judgment in favour of AGT of the balance remaining after the set-off, together
with interest, and otherwise to dismiss the
proceedings (with an order that each
bear its own costs) ([9] of the costs judgment). Hence in each proceeding a
declaration was
made: in favour of Holdings as to the liability of the Jane
Defendants pursuant to the Share Sale Agreement for the sum of $1.7 million;
favour of AGT as to the amount to which VCFA was indebted to it; and pursuant to
cl 5.9 of the Share Sale Agreement that the first
of those amounts be set-off
against the second. The 2019 proceedings were then dismissed and in the 2020
proceedings judgment was
entered in favour of AGT for
$176,971.63.
Cross-Appellants’ submissions
cross-appellants submit (as they did before the primary judge) that the outcome
of the 2019 proceedings was that Holdings’
claim against the Jane
Defendants was defeated by a set-off for the complete sum. Therefore, they
submit that Holdings was wholly
unsuccessful and that the Jane Defendants were
wholly successful. The cross-appellants accept that the outcome of the 2020
proceedings
was that AGT’s claims against VCFA were partially successful
(in that the rent and outgoings claimed were not established)
but they emphasise
that AGT nonetheless succeeded in obtaining judgment in the sum of $176,971.63.
Further, the cross-appellants
say that it is not incumbent upon a defendant to
prove more by way of set-off than the claim it seeks to defeat. Hence, it is
that the result was still the “total nullification” of
Holdings’ claim against the four Jane Defendants.
cross-appellants argue that, but for Holdings commencing the 2019 proceedings,
they would not have incurred the expense of the
2019 proceedings nor would they
have been required (in order to resist the 2019 proceedings) to bring the 2020
proceedings. The
cross-appellants thus say that it follows that their expense
in both proceedings is a direct consequential result of Holdings choosing
file its statement of claim in the 2019 proceedings.
cross-appellants again submit that the discretion to depart from the general
rule (that costs follow the event) must be exercised
judicially and according to
rules of reason and justice; and that it is for an unsuccessful party to show
why the usual approach
ought not apply. They submit that, if considering a
departure from the ordinary rule, the court should have regard to the principles
of fairness underlying the making of any costs order.
cross-appellants argue that, by ordering both parties to bear their own costs,
the primary judge treated the proceedings as if
they were a draw; i.e., that
some of the cross-appellants’ arguments had succeeded, some had failed,
and the result had been
a judgment in favour of the cross-appellants as opposed
to a judgment against them for a considerable sum as sought by Holdings.
cross-appellants complain that his Honour did not take account of the defensive
necessity of the 2020 proceedings; and they
argue that it follows that his
Honour’s discretion miscarried.
cross-appellants submit that they were triumphant in the 2019 proceedings;
defeating the claim brought against them. They accept
that a court may order to
deprive a successful party of the costs relating to an issue on which it was
unsuccessful, but they submit
that this will usually only be done where that
issue was clearly dominant or separable; and that a court will generally only
the successful party of the costs relating to an issue on which it was
unsuccessful when that issue was clearly dominant or separable.
cross-appellants say that this was not the case here – that the claims
which the cross-appellants lost did not take up
much time or space in terms of
the evidence or the space allocated to them by the primary judge in the combined
cross-appellants submit that the primary judge erred by treating the outcome as
“mixed success” in issues as if they
were equal in terms of weight,
evidence time taken up at trial and in the combined judgment and capacity to
generate costs; and therefore
erred in exercising his discretion to order that
each set of parties is to bear its own costs. The cross-appellants maintain
the appropriate order was for Holdings to pay the Jane Defendants’
costs of the 2019 proceedings and to pay AGT its costs in
proceedings.
the alternative, if a judicial exercise of the discretion warranted some
recognition in the making of costs orders that the cross-appellants
had lost on
some claims, even though they succeeded in the overall event, the
cross-appellants say that the appropriate exercise
of discretion would have been
to order that the cross-appellants’ costs be paid in each proceedings with
some adjustment by
a percentage reduction in the total amount of costs to be
Cross-respondents’ submissions
to the cross-appeal, the cross-respondents submit that the primary judge
correctly recognised a mixture of success by the various
parties in the
respective proceedings (rejecting the contention that the result of the two sets
of proceedings was a complete victory
deserving of costs in both
proceedings).
cross-respondents say that, in the 2019 proceedings: Holdings succeeded in
proving its claim for $1.7 million against the Jane
Defendants (over their
denial) of that claim; the Jane Defendants’ defence of a set-off for
$985,029.76 for “IPO Expenses”
failed against Holdings’ claim;
but there was no judgment in the 2019 proceedings because of an agreed set-off
of the result
of the 2020 proceedings; and the result of the 2020 proceedings
was in favour of AGT $1,300,035 (plus interest at 10%) for greater
Holdings’ claim for $1.7 million (plus interest at

cross-respondents point out that, in the 2020 proceedings: AGT’s claim
that $1,300,035 paid to VCFA was a loan to be repaid
with interest at 10%
succeeded, but that AGT’s claim concerned with leased office premises and
other claims failed.
the cross-respondents say that the primary judge correctly characterised the
result, after making declarations in favour of
Holdings for $1.7 million in the
2019 proceedings and in favour of AGT for $1,834,371.27 in the 2020 proceedings,
as mixed success
of each set of parties – as the outcome of the trial was
that each set of parties owed debts of similar size to the other,
outcome for which no party contended.
cross-respondents argue that the primary judge correctly exercised the
discretion as to costs. The cross-respondents refer in
that regard to the
authorities as to costs where there is a mixed outcome in proceedings, noting
that the question of apportionment
of costs is a matter of impression,
evaluation and judgment; and that where parties enjoy mixed success on separate
issues, two possible
ways of dealing with costs at trial are, first, to award
each party a portion of their costs reflecting their success and, second,
there be no order as to costs with the intention that each party should bear its
own costs (citing

Reply submissions
reply submissions, the cross-appellants say that the court should have regard to
the purpose, rationale and principles of fairness
which inform the usual
approach before departing from it; and, in particular, the court should have
regard to the relative responsibilities
of the parties for the incurring of
costs. Reference is made to what was said in
per French CJ,
Kiefel, Nettle and Gordon JJ at [6]:
... the preferable approach in this case is the one usually taken, that costs
should follow the outcome of the appeal. This is not
a case where it may be said
that the event of success is contestable, by reference to how separate issues
have been determined. There
are no special circumstances to warrant a departure
from the general rule, and good reasons not to encourage applications regarding
costs on an issue-by-issue basis, involving apportionments based on degrees of
difficulty of issues, time taken to argue them and
cross-appellants say that the primary judge did not refer to the usual approach,
nor any of the principles to be considered when
departing from it. They
submitted that the failure to consider and apply those principles led the
primary judge into error in assuming
that, because there were some issues on
which the cross-appellants lost, there was a “mixed result”. The
cross-appellants
say that the result was that the primary judge unjustifiably
departed from the usual approach, an error of the sort contemplated
at 505 per Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan

One such relevant rule is r 42.1 of the

there are a number of issues in the proceedings on which there have been varying
degrees of success, it will not always be easy
to identify the
“event” for the purpose of the application of the general rule as to

present case, this was complicated by the fact
that there were two sets of proceedings (with different thought related parties)
at least on first blush, mixed success in both sets of proceedings.

of a total failure of consideration (on the basis that there had been no
execution of the Share Sale Agreement).
Its alternative claim was based on
recovery of that amount pursuant to the Share Sale Agreement. The Jane
Defendants denied any obligation
to repay the amount but also pleaded a defence
of set-off pursuant to that the Share Sale Agreement.
did not succeed on its (primary) restitutionary claim for money had and received
because that claim was premised on the contention
(contrary to his
Honour’s findings) that no Share Sale Agreement had been executed and
hence there had been a total failure
of consideration for the payment of
$1.7 million deposit ([240]). However, Holdings succeeded on its
alternative claim at least to
the extent that his Honour held that there was an
obligation to repay the $1.7 million under the terms of that agreement, subject
to any set-off that could be established. His Honour concluded (this being an
issue determined in the 2020 proceedings) that VCFA
was indebted to AGT as at
17 July 2019 in respect of the principal advances of $1,300,035 and
interest thereon at the agreed rate
of 10%. As the interest calculation produced
an amount greater than the total indebtedness of the Jane Defendants to Holdings
[266]), the result of the application of the contractual set-off was that
no amount was payable to the Jane Defendants in respect
of the deposit
then is the relevant “event” for the purpose of the general rule as
to costs? As already noted, the difficulty of
ascertaining such an event where
there are multiple issues in proceedings has been recognised in a number of

meant by “event” or “issue”
in this context. The

gives abundant
examples which establish this point.
In particular one does not look at
issues as if they were pleaders’ issues but approaches the matter with a
broad brush

rationale underlying the general rule is reflected in the observation made by
Jacobs J in
Cretazzo v Lombardi
[1975] SASC 2512
(1975) 13 SASR 4
(at 16) that:
... trials occur daily in which the party, who in the end is wholly or
substantially successful, nevertheless fails along the way
on particular issues
of fact or law. The ultimate ends of justice may not be served if a party is
dissuaded by the risk of costs
from canvassing all issues, however doubtful,
which might be material to the decision of the case. There are, of course, many
affecting the exercise of the discretion as to costs in each case,
including in particular, the severability of the issues, and no
two cases are
alike. I wish merely to lend no encouragement to any suggestion that a party
against whom the judgment goes ought nevertheless
to anticipate a favourable
exercise of the judicial discretion as to costs in respect of issues upon which
he may have succeeded,
based merely on his success in those particular issues.
against this, the rationale underlying a departure from the ordinary costs rule
appears to be that where there are multiple issues
the application of the
general rule may involve hardship where a party succeeds on some issues but not

highlights the complaint by the cross-appellants that in the present case his
Honour did not address the circumstances in which
an apportionment of costs as
between the different issues was here considered appropriate. Relevant
circumstances in which apportionment
across different issues have been said to
include: where a successful party has, in respect of one or more issues,
improperly, or unnecessarily increased the costs”
(Waddell J, as his Honour then was, in

the time has been taken on an issue on which the unsuccessful party had
succeeded (Mahoney JA in

observed in
Bowen Investments Pty Ltd v Tabcorp Holdings Ltd (No 2)
[2008] FCAFC 107
, fairness should dictate how the costs discretion is to
be exercised.
the present case, the difficulty I have (and the reason that I have concluded
that leave to cross-appeal should be granted) is
that while the primary judge
clearly identified separate issues or different “events”, his
Honour’s decision to
exercise the costs discretion by reference to the
different events seems to have been based solely on his Honour’s
that “the outcome of these proceedings was, in essence, that
each set of parties owed debts of similar size to the other, this
position for which no party contended” (at [9] of the costs judgment).
While I consider that there should be a reluctance
to grant leave to challenge
orders confined to costs, I have concluded that the fact that the primary judge
did not address (beyond
reference to the similarity in size of the debts) why
there should be a departure from the general rule (or why the separate issues
gave rise to different “events” in respect of which separate costs
orders would be warranted) indicates that there is
an issue of general principle
here raised (see
Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services
(2017) 95 NSWLR 597
[2017] NSWCA 206
[2011] NSWCA 284
), warranting the grant of leave.
make no criticism of the fact that the primary judge dealt only briefly in the
costs judgment with the principles applicable in
relation to the question of
costs. Formulaic recitation of those principles is not necessary. It is clear
that his Honour was addressing
(and rejecting) the contention by the
cross-appellants that there had been a complete victory by the cross-appellants.
at [8] his Honour noted the issues on which the cross-appellants had
not succeeded.
makes clear enough in my view that his Honour was identifying that there were
distinct or severable issues on which the parties
had had mixed success. Thus,
the discretion to apportion costs across the respective issues fell for
consideration. However, what
is not clear is to why the similarity in amount of
the competing debt claims should have deprived the cross-appellants of any order
for costs in their favour, particularly where (as here) there was a reasonable
argument that the second set of proceedings was defensive
and in response to the
first set of proceedings in which, in substance, the cross-respondents lost
(notwithstanding that there was
a declaration in favour of Holdings on the issue
as to repayment of the deposit). That said, I do not accept that the approach
by his Honour is one that elides the jurisdiction into a “no
costs” jurisdiction. As to the criticism that his Honour
failed to assess
the “practical outcome” of the litigation, I do not accept that to
be justified. It seems to me that
his Honour was only too well aware of that
outcome. Nevertheless, as I consider that there was error in the application of
in the exercise of the costs discretion it is necessary to consider
what order should now be made.
the re-exercise of the costs discretion, the relevant events across the two
proceedings can readily be understood as being: whether
there was a liability to
repay the $1.7 million (either as money had and received or under the
contractual arrangements); whether
there was a liability to repay float expenses
which could be set-off against that liability; whether there was an obligation
the $1.3 million loan which could be set-off against the first
liability; and whether there was a liability to repay amounts under
the alleged
rental agreement which could be set-off against the first liability. Each was a
separate claim, albeit that the claims
were related (by reason of the fact that
the set-off claims were raised in order to resist the claim by Holdings in
respect of the
$1.7 million deposit). So much is implicit in his
Honour’s treatment of the claims at [8] of the costs judgment.
cross-appellants succeeded on the second and third of those issues but failed in
their denial of liability to repay the $1.7 million
(the first issue) and the
last. The practical outcome, however, was that the cross-appellants obtained an
order for judgment in their
favour as a result of the application of the set-off
claim on which they were successful.
having the familiarity that the primary judge had as to the conduct of the trial
(and without the benefit of submissions as
to time spent on particular issues or
the like) it is difficult to apportion costs across those separate
“events”. However,
the authorities to which I have referred above
make clear that the apportionment of costs across multiple issues can properly
done on an impressionistic basis.
all the circumstances, I am persuaded that there should be some departure from
the general rule in order to reflect that costs
were incurred on the set-off
claims that failed (the IPO expenses claim and the rent claim). I consider that
the $1.7 million deposit
claim and the $1.35 million claimed set-off by
reference to the loan were sufficiently interlinked so as not to warrant a
from the costs payable to the successful cross-appellants. On the
basis that the set-off claims which failed seem to have occupied
a relatively
small proportion of his Honour’s reasons ([104]-[121]) in relation to the
rent claim, which did not appear to
involve much in the way of evidence; and
[272]-[281] of the reasons in relation to the IPO float expenses, again with
little evidence, I would adopt a broad brush approach and conclude
that the appropriate costs order would be that the cross-respondents
the costs of the cross-appellants in the respective
proceedings.
the above reasons, I would make the following orders:
(1) Dismiss the appeal with costs.
(2) Grant leave to the cross-appellants to cross-appeal against the costs orders
made in the respective proceedings.
(3) Allow the cross-appeal and set aside order (3) made in 2019/374869 and order
(5) in 2020/219022 and in lieu thereof order:
(a) in proceeding 2019/374869, leaving aside any previous interlocutory costs
orders, that the plaintiff pay 75% of the costs of
the defendants of the
proceedings; and
(b) in proceeding 2020/219022, leaving aside any previous interlocutory costs
orders, that the defendant pay 75% of the costs of
the plaintiff of the
proceedings.
(4) Order the cross-respondents to pay the cross-appellants’ costs of the
cross-appeal.
(5) Dismiss the cross-respondents’ motion as to incompetency of the
cross-appeal with no order as to costs.
: I agree with Ward P.
: : For the reasons given by the President, I agree that the appeal
should be dismissed with costs. I also agree that the cross-appeal
allowed, and orders for the payment of costs of the trial to the
cross-appellants made, but would not discount the orders.
My reasons with
respect to the cross-appeal follow.
cross-appeal raises two issues, namely whether:
(1) the cross-appellants require leave to appeal, and
(2) the trial judge erred in making no order as to the costs of the proceedings
in the Division.
Leave to appeal
there was no commonality of parties between the two proceedings in the Division,
it is necessary to address the cross-appeals
separately. Both were filed on 9
April 2024. In relation to the 2020 proceeding, Access Group Training Pty Ltd
(AGT) sought in ground
1 of its cross-appeal to raise a contractual claim
dismissed by the trial judge, Nixon J. That ground was abandoned in written
submissions
filed on 7 June 2024. Ground 2 challenged the failure of the trial
judge to award the company its costs of the trial. It was the
only ground
pursued at the hearing in this Court.
relation to the 2019 proceeding, the defendants at trial (the Jane parties)
raised four grounds in their cross-appeal. Ground 1
involved the same
contractual challenge as that raised by AGT; it was abandoned in the common
written submissions. Ground 2 addressed
the absence of a costs order in their
favour. Grounds 3 and 4 were matters which should properly have been raised in a
contention, as they sought to support the orders in fact made by the
trial judge on other grounds than those he had relied on.
followed that, by the time the cross-appeals were heard, each related to a
question of costs only. An appeal from a judgment or
order “as to costs
only which are in the discretion of the court” requires leave:
Court Act 1970
s 101(2)(c).
The cross-appellants conceded that they
required leave. However, the question is whether an appeal which was not as to
at the time it was commenced, because it included non-colourable
challenges to substantive orders, became susceptible to the leave
requirement
when the challenge to the substantive orders was abandoned or, as in this case,
fell away because the appellants abandoned
the relevant part of the primary
one view, the right of appeal conferred by
Supreme Court
, in so far as it is conditional, sets jurisdictional conditions which
must be satisfied at the time the notice of appeal is filed
and served. That
view is consistent with the established principle that failure to obtain leave,
where leave is required, renders
the appeal incompetent and liable to summary
dismissal. For example, in
the High Court
considered whether the interest of a tenant in possession, being the subject
matter of the proceedings, had a value
in excess of a prescribed amount
permitting an appeal. Accepting the concession that it did not, the appeal was
dismissed as incompetent.
approach was accepted by Meagher JA in
Ghosh v NineMSN Pty
a matter of statutory construction, that approach must be correct, a right of
appeal being purely a creature of statute and thus
subject to the conditions
imposed by the statute. The right of appeal to this Court in the present case
was granted by
Supreme Court Act
, relevantly from
“any judgment or order of the Court in a Division”, but
“[s]ubject to this and any other Act”.
The right is therefore
, which is a qualified prohibition, commencing:
(2) An appeal shall not lie to the Court of Appeal, except by
leave of the Court of Appeal, from....
language is apt to withhold the right granted under
, in relation to the
matters identified in subs (2), unless and until leave is granted. There is,
however, no suggestion that the
right originally engaged is defeasible where
circumstances change; nor is there any provision in the rules for seeking leave
in circumstances
where an appeal has been commenced prior to a change in
circumstances.
case is not concerned with the possibility that an inchoate right may arise upon
the delivery of a judgment or the making of
orders which might be lost where
circumstances change after that date, but before a timely notice of appeal is
issue appears not to have arisen for determination (and was not the subject of
submissions in the present case), no doubt partly
because in most cases the
requirement for leave will be determined by the nature of the judgment or order
sought to be the subject
of an appeal. However, in respect of an appeal as to
“costs only”, while the question whether the order is as to costs
will be determined by reference to the matter under appeal, the possibility that
the notice of appeal may contain other matters is
a variable which may change
over time. It is possible that a similar issue could arise with respect to
s 101(2)(r)
, requiring that the matter at issue be of a particular value,
which may also change over time. One such circumstance may arise where
the appeal is conceded, so as to leave in dispute only an amount under the
history of the requirement for leave with respect to appeals from judgments or
orders as to “costs only” was considered
by this Court in
v Camuglia.
The precise
issue now under consideration did not arise, but, after considering cases with
respect to cross-appeals as to costs, Leeming
JA concluded:
“84 The upshot of the above is that an appeal raising
bona fide substantive grounds as well as costs is not an appeal as
‘costs only’ within the meaning of
s 101(2)(c)
Court Act 1970
s 127(2)(b)
District Court Act 1973
that remains so even if the substantive grounds are rejected.”
it is unsurprising that the right of appeal from one order does not depend upon
the outcome of the appeal with respect to other
orders, the analysis in
is nevertheless consistent with the view that once the right of
appeal is invoked, the appeal will be competent, without leave.
analogous situation arises in relation to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court,
being a court of limited jurisdiction which depends
on the existence of a
“matter” under Ch III of the
Constitution
. A matter may involve
claims under both federal and state law arising from a common substratum of
circumstances. Questions of the
continuity of jurisdiction, once engaged, may
arise where the federal law claims fall away. In
Petrotimor Companhia de
Petroleos SARL v Commonwealth of
Black CJ and Hill J

federal claim which is brought within the jurisdiction of the Court

To similar effect, Beaumont J stated (emphasis in original):
“33 ... It may be accepted, as was held in

the concession by the cross-appellants as to the need for leave, in the
circumstances which had arisen, in my view the cross-appeals
were competently
commenced and did not thereafter cease to be competent, absent a grant of leave.
However, if leave were required,
then it should be granted because the case
raises an issue at least as to the application of principle, if not as to the
the relevant principle, and a substantial miscarriage.
Costs following the event
issue raised on the cross-appeals was whether the trial judge erred in failing
to make appropriate costs orders with respect to
the proceedings determined by
him. That question may be broken down into two parts, namely whether the judge
(i) failed to correctly
identify the “event” for the purposes of
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005
(NSW), r 42.1 or, (ii) erred in making
“some other order” because it appeared to him, pursuant to the power
by the rule, that “some other order should be made”.
speaking, the “event” referred to in r 42.1 is not to be broken down
by reference to individual issues or findings,
but refers to the outcome of the
proceeding. There is no great magic in the word “event”: many cases
involve mixed success.
Even where there is one issue, namely the assessment of
compensation, it will be common that the successful plaintiff receives less
he or she sought.
relevant principles in dealing with cases of mixed outcomes were identified by
this Court in
Galati v Deans (No
in the following
“6 The broad and unfettered discretion as to costs
conferred by
Civil Procedure Act 2005
(NSW) is expressly
rendered subject to rules of court. The general rule applying to a hearing
determined on the merits is that ‘the
court is to order that the costs
follow the event unless it appears to the court that some other order should be
made as to the whole
or any part of the costs’: ... r 42.1. Rule 42.1 has
been construed on the basis that ‘the event’ which costs should
prima facie follow can be identified as a judgment for the plaintiff or the
defendant on the claim.
7 In applying this principle, it need not be assumed that each
trial or appeal involves a singular ‘event’. That was
not the case
in relation to the present trial or the current appeal. There were entirely
separate questions as to the beneficial
interests in the shares held by TRHS Pty
Ltd in Felan’s Fisheries Pty Ltd and a claim for disgorgement of part of a
commission obtained by one party in relation to the acquisition of those
8 Further, even in relation to a particular matter, such as the
determination of the beneficial ownership of the shares, it may
be appropriate
to allocate costs or limit the costs recoverable by the successful party where a
clearly dominant issue has been determined
against it, or where there are
clearly separable issues on some of which it has
On the other hand, as
Bostik Australia Pty Ltd v Liddiard (No
‘Where there are multiple issues in a case the Court generally does not
attempt to differentiate between the issues on which
a party was successful and
those on which it failed. Unless a particular issue or group of issues is
clearly dominant or separable
it will ordinarily be appropriate to award the
costs of the proceedings to the successful party without attempting to
differentiate
between those particular issues on which it was successful and
those on which it failed.’
9 The Court has a broad discretion, to be exercised according
to the purpose of compensating, at least in part, the costs reasonably
by a successful party in establishing its rights, subject to the need to accord
fairness to each party in the particular
circumstances of the
principles have been restated from time to time, sometimes with more citation of
authority and sometimes with a focus on the
specific matters in
In considering whether a
party should be deprived of its costs because it has failed on particular
issues, it may be important to
have regard to whether or not it was the moving
party. As Burchett J noted in
Australian Conservation Foundation v Forestry
“A party against whom an unsustainable claim is prosecuted is not to be
forced, at his peril in respect of costs, to abandon
every defence he is not
sure of maintaining, and oppose to his adversary only the barrier of one hopeful
argument: he is entitled
to rise his earthworks at every reasonable point along
the path of assault. At the same time, if he multiplies issues unreasonably,
may suffer in costs.”
this case, the proceedings were commenced in 2019 by Access Training Group Ltd
(“Holdings”) against the Jane parties
(being the shareholders of
AGT). Although the trial judge made a declaration that the Jane parties were
obliged to pay Holdings $1.7
million on 17 July 2019, that entitlement did not
give rise to a judgment, because it was subject to a set-off by reference to any
amount owing by Holdings’ related company, Venture Capital Fund Australia
Ltd (Venture Capital) to AGT. As the latter debt
was found in the 2020
proceedings to exceed the former, the substantive result in the 2019 proceedings
was that the proceedings be
AGT was not a party to the 2019 proceedings, in order to establish the amount of
the set-off, fresh proceedings were commenced
by AGT against Venture Capital in
2020. In those proceedings AGT obtained a judgment for $176,971.63, being the
balance owing after
the setting-off exercise.
AGT was not successful in all its claims in the 2020 proceedings, it was a
defensive proceeding forced upon it and its shareholders
as a result of the
proceedings commenced by Holdings. Accordingly, AGT was only in a formal sense
the moving party in those proceedings.
Further, although the judgment in favour
of AGT was in a relatively small amount (some 10% of the amount owing by its
shareholders
to Holdings), its true entitlement (before the set-off) was
$1,834,371.27, as against Venture Capital.
further consideration in the present case is that the trial judge appears to
have set-off costs against each other. In principle,
that approach was not open:
the parties to the proceedings did not overlap. Indeed, no party was common to
both proceedings.
hearing of the two proceedings ran for five days, but two were very short and
the transcript suggested there were less than three
full days of hearing. The
parties went to significant length to deal with the matters expeditiously.
Indeed, some claims were dismissed
for want of evidence.
the cross-appeal was also dealt with expeditiously in this Court. The
cross-appellant’s written submissions ran to
20 paragraphs; the
cross-respondents’ written submissions were of a similar length. Whilst
the cross-appellant laid the responsibility
for initiating the proceedings at
the feet of Holdings, neither party alleged that any particular claim was
unreasonable and without
foundation, nor that the other party acted unreasonably
in the conduct of the proceedings. The cross-respondents did not contend
the cross-appellant had failed on matters constituting a dominant part of the
proceedings.
appropriate order in the 2019 proceedings is that Holdings pay the Jane
defendants their costs of that proceeding. In the event,
they were successful.
The fact that aspects of their earthworks collapsed should not be held against
them unless their defensive
positions were unreasonable, were pursued in a
manner which unreasonably extended the hearing of the matter, or were entirely
and dominant. Absent one of those elements, none of which was
established, the Jane defendants should have their costs of the trial
Holdings without diminution.
respect to the 2020 proceedings, AGT was successful in its claim against Venture
Capital and should have its costs of that proceeding.
It failed only on minor
and entirely subsidiary issues, not warranting some proportionate
entitlements should not be reduced by reliance on an inchoate principle of
fairness, as that would be to invite reducing costs
awards which are otherwise
appropriate by reference to the outcomes of individual issues. The authorities
referred to above warn
against that.
these circumstances, the following orders should be made in the
cross-appeals:
(1) Allow the cross-appeals and vary the orders entered on 18 and 25 March
(2) In the 2019 proceeding –
(a) set aside order (3) and
(b) in lieu thereof, and without disturbing interlocutory costs orders, order
that the plaintiff pay the defendants’ costs
in the Division.
(3) In the 2020 proceeding –
(a) set aside order (5) and
(b) in lieu thereof, and without disturbing interlocutory costs orders, order
that the defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs
in the Division.
