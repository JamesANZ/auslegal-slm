2. All copies of photos and reports are to be returned
under separate cover to the landlord’s agent.
REASONS FOR DECISION
After perusing the photographs, the
ingoing and outgoing condition reports and hearing the evidence, the Tribunal
has concluded that
the landlords’ claim is largely made out. It is
unfortunate that there are not more photos taken after the cleaning on 15
September 2001, but the Tribunal is entitled to infer from the extent of the
problems shown with the walls prior to the cleaning,
that some of those marks
would be permanent, they are still extensive, and the remaining would be over
and above fair wear and tear.
The Tribunal has noted the marks shown on
the ingoing condition report, but has considered they are indicative of premises
around 4 years prior to (5 years by the end of the
This does however suggest that they may
well have had to be painted in any event on or about another two years (ie seven
years normal
capital repainting). Thus, the loss to the landlord is more like
30% of the capital cost, and not 40% as claimed.
As above, the photos after cleaning do
not greatly assist, but the prior photos more clearly suggest in relation to the
carpet that
there would remain significant marks and stains, well over normal
fair wear and tear. Thus the claim for replacement is more clearly
However, the ingoing condition report
notes the carpet is "worn" in every room, and "stained and very worn" in the
dining area. The
Tribunal has concluded that this is either indicative of hard
use prior to that report, or lesser quality carpet. The photos do
suggest that,
apart from the marks from this tenants’ occupants, it was still clearly
useable for a few years hence, and thus
the landlords’ discounted
percentage (40%) is appropriate. That is, based on the life of lesser quality
carpet of (about)
10 years, and taking into account this particular carpet was
more worn than most (after 4 years at that time).
allowed in full at $1,578.00
view of the notations on the ingoing report, the blind repair claim (of $45.00)
was not made out.
Rent from 10 August
2001 to 18 September 2001
This claim was more contentious. The
landlord, Ms Southwell had carried out extensive steps to obtain a series of
quotes, and after
some initial approaches by the tenant, Ms Thomas, the
(extensive) cleaning was not done until 15 September 2001 (by the
contractor). The Tribunal finds the tenants were willing and
able to clean (thus reducing the quantum, perhaps, of the landlords’
claim), and that cleaning in any event should have taken place within the first
week after vacating. It does not matter that the
carpets needed replacing,
verbal quotes could have been obtained in that time (and put in writing, later,
for the claim).
That time frame should reasonably include
a day for laying of carpet (cleaning only apparently taking one day, as not
specified otherwise
in the cleaner’s report). A further three days (at
most) should be allowed for painting (whether done before or after a new
tenant). Any other time claimed would be the normal turnaround time for
reletting of property, for which this tenant is not
responsible
Thus total time allowed for loss of rent arising
from cleaning, carpet and painting is 10 days, ie
The total amount payable is
therefore as follows:
1. Painting
2. Rent from 10/8/01 to 20/8/01
Plus amounts agreed by the landlords and tenants (rent order overrides
the amount the tenants agreed to of $297.13):
TOTAL PAYABLE
Less further rent payments by tenants:
