____________________________________________________________________
Background and Complaint
In approximately 2006, the Complainant submitted an
unsolicited email application to an employee of the Respondent for the purpose
of seeking employment. This application contained a covering letter and details
Subsequently, the Complainant’s application for employment was uploaded
to a personal blog website by an employee of the Respondent.
The uploaded
information contained extracts of the Complainant’s application and went
on to make generally unfavourable remarks
qualifications and application. The website was available online and without any
restrictions as to
who could view it. Additionally, other unidentified
individuals had made further negative statements in the ‘comments’
section of the website about the Complainant’s application and
qualifications.
In June 2012, the Complainant became aware of the website when he was
directed to it by a friend. The Complainant immediately lodged
a complaint with
the Respondent.
The Respondent investigated the matter and confirmed a breach of privacy had
occurred. The Respondent provided a written apology to
the Complainant and
immediately instructed the employee to remove the material from the website. The
employee in question was also
directed to attend privacy training.
Complaint to the Privacy Commissioner
The Complainant was unsatisfied with the response, stating that the personal
information on the website had been available for over
five years and that the
website had been allegedly visited or viewed (according to the website’s
statistics) over 100,000 times.
The Complainant believed that the information
uploaded to the website had a detrimental effect on the Complainant’s
to secure work, particularly in light of the derogatory comments on the
Response from the Respondent
The Respondent conceded that a breach of the Complainant’s privacy had
occurred. However, it argued that the organisation was
unaware of the
employee’s actions until the complaint was raised and was therefore unable
to take reasonable steps to protect
or secure the Complainant’s personal
information (IPP 4) or ensure accuracy (IPP 3). The Respondent also argued that
adequately dealt with the complaint under section 29(1)(h)(i) of the Act
and requested the Acting Commissioner exercise his discretion
to decline the
Acting Privacy Commissioner’s decision
The Acting Privacy Commissioner acknowledged that the Respondent had already
conceded that a breach of privacy had occurred. The Commissioner
also commented
that actions of an employee are generally attributable to an organisation (here,
the Respondent) and that the Respondent
had not provided evidence to support
what steps the Respondent had taken to educate the employee on their
responsibilities under
Information Privacy Act.
Commissioner therefore stated that he did not believe the Respondent had taken
reasonable steps to protect the personal
information it held from misuse and
disclosure (IPP 4.1) or inaccuracy (IPP 3.1). There also appeared no grounds
under IPP 2 that
supported the disclosure.
Whilst section 29(1)(h) of the Act allows the Privacy Commissioner to decline
a complaint if the Commissioner considers the matter
has been adequately dealt
with, the Commissioner decided this was not appropriate as the Complainant
remained unsatisfied with the
action taken to resolve his concerns and had a
legitimate basis to argue that he had suffered some unresolved effects or
The Commissioner considered that there was merit in referring the complaint
to conciliation to resolve the matter.
Conciliation
The Complaint was successfully resolved following an offer by
the Respondent to financially compensate the Complainant for injury
Complainant’s feelings and humiliation suffered as a result of
disclosure.
