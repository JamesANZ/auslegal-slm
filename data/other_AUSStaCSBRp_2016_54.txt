Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill 2016 [2016] AUSStaCSBRp 54 (9 November 2016)
Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill 2016
Retrospective application
Schedule 1, item 4
Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage
Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill 2016
This bill amends the
Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act
(OPGGS Act) to:
• ensure the ongoing validity of apportionment agreements, where it
becomes apparent that an agreement relates to an area which
contains multiple
petroleum pools, rather than a single discrete pool; and
• ensure legislative support for regulations that provide for refunds
and remittals of environment plan levies and safety case

The committee dealt with this bill in
Alert Digest No. 7 of 2016
Minister responded to the committee’s comments in a letter dated
27 October 2016. A copy of the letter is attached to
this report.
Alert Digest No. 7 of 2016 - extract
Retrospective
application
Schedule 1, item 4
This application provision states that subsections 54(1A) and (1E) of the
OPGGS Act apply in relation to an agreement made before,
at or after the
commencement of this item.
The explanatory memorandum suggests that this is necessary as an
apportionment agreement, about a particular petroleum pool which
shares both
Commonwealth and Western Australian waters, was made before the commencement of
Schedule 1 to this bill (at p. 10).
However, although the explanatory memorandum indicates that this item will
also give effect to any other agreement that may be negotiated
and entered into
before the commencement of schedule 1 to this bill, it does not expressly
address the question of whether the application
of subsections 54(1A) and (1E)
to such agreements may cause any detriment to any parties.
The committee seeks the Minister’s advice as to whether the
application of subsections 54(1A) and (1E) of the OPGGS Act to agreements
before the commencement of the provisions in this bill could cause detriment to
any parties to those agreements.
Minister’s response - extract
Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006
(OPGGS Act) provides for a determination to be made, through agreement
between the titleholder, the Joint Authority and the relevant
State or Northern
Territory Minister, of the proportion of petroleum derived from a Commonwealth
title area, where a petroleum pool
straddles a Commonwealth title area and a
State or Northern Territory title area. The purpose of an apportionment
agreement is to
fix the proportions of recovered petroleum taxable respectively
under Commonwealth legislation and State or Northern Territory legislation.
This Bill amends section 54 of the OPGGS Act to preserve the validity of
apportionment agreements in the event that:
a) the petroleum resource covered by the agreement is subsequently discovered
to comprise, or be likely to comprise, multiple pools
(subsection 54(1A));
b) the parties are uncertain of the extent of a petroleum pool at the time
the agreement is made (subsection 54(1E)).
As outlined at page 1 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill, the purpose
of apportionment agreements is to:
"...provide certainty for the titleholder and government parties, into the
future, as to the revenue regimes that will apply to the
petroleum once it is
recovered. In the case of a titleholder whose resource straddles a
Commonwealth-State boundary, an up-front
apportionment between jurisdictional
revenue regimes (Commonwealth petroleum resource rent tax and State royalty) may
be a key factor
in the titleholder’s commercial decision whether to commit
to further investment in the project at that point in time."
For new subsections 54(1A) or 54(1E) of the OPGGS Act to apply, the agreement
must contain the specific terms required under those
subsections (the
apportionment provisions). If these terms are not included, existing subsection
54(1) of the OPGGS Act will continue
to apply to an apportionment agreement.
Subsection 54(1) contemplates that an apportionment agreement relates to a
single discrete
petroleum pool. If it subsequently becomes apparent that the
area specified in the apportionment agreement contains multiple petroleum
as may be the case when fuller technical information is obtained as the resource
is developed, the apportionment agreement
would therefore fail and a new
apportionment agreement would need to be reached. This would negate the revenue
certainty for both
Commonwealth and State/Northern Territory governments, as
well as commercial certainty for the titleholder.
Parties are not required to take up these new preservation arrangements
provided by new subsections 54(1A) or 54(1E) of the OPGGS
Act, and would need to
deliberately opt into them by adopting appropriate provisions as part of an
apportionment agreement.
With respect to the retrospective application of the amendments, the Torosa
apportionment Deed of Agreement (the Agreement) is currently
apportionment agreement under section 54 of the OPGGS Act. All parties to the
Agreement voluntarily agreed to the inclusion
of specific terms in the
agreement, that reflect the requirements of proposed subsection 54(1A). This was
to ensure that the Agreement
will remain valid if it becomes apparent that the
Torosa resource comprises, or is likely to comprise, multiple petroleum pools.
The parties also included a specific condition precedent for the commencement of
the Agreement, linked to the commencement of the
amendments to both Commonwealth
and State legislation.
There is no detriment caused to any party to the Agreement by virtue of
retrospective application of the amendments. Indeed, as described
Explanatory Memorandum, the amendments will benefit the parties to the
Agreement, by providing ongoing certainty as to the
apportionment of petroleum
recovered from the Torosa field. All parties to the Agreement were consulted
regarding the proposed amendments
to ensure they were satisfied with the form
and application/effect.
The proposed amendments will give effect to any other agreement that may be
negotiated and entered into before the commencement of
Schedule 1 to this Bill
which relies, for its ongoing effectiveness, on the provisions of subsection
54(1A) or 54(1E) of the OPGGS
Act. As noted above, there are no other such
agreements at this time. However, if any such agreement is made prior to passage
commencement of the Bill, retrospective application will only occur through
deliberate inclusion by the parties of the specific terms
as required under
proposed subsections 54(1A) or 54(1E) of the OPGGS Act. It would therefore be up
to the parties to elect to so
incorporate such terms in their apportionment
agreement, in order to achieve ongoing certainty. Retrospective application
result in any detriment to such parties – noting that they would
have taken positive steps to voluntarily opt into the new
preservation
arrangements.
Committee response
The committee thanks the Minister for this response. In particular, the
committee notes the Minister’s advice that there is
currently only one
apportionment agreement that will be affected by this bill and that all parties
to that agreement voluntarily
agreed to include terms reflecting the
requirements of the bill. The committee also notes the Minister’s advice
that if any
other agreement is made prior to passage and commencement of the
bill, the parties to that agreement would need to deliberately include
specific terms as required under proposed subsections 54(1A) or 54(1E) and
retrospective application would not result in any
detriment to such parties.
The committee requests that the key information provided by the Minister
be included in the explanatory memorandum, noting the importance
documents as a point of access to understanding the law and, if needed, as
extrinsic material to assist with interpretation
section 15AB
Acts Interpretation Act 1901
In light of the detailed information provided, and the advice that any
retrospective application would not cause any party detriment,
the committee
makes no further comment in relation to this provision.
