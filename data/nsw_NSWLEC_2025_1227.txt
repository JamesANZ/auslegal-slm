proceedings have been brought to the Court pursuant to
Environmental Planning and Assessment Act
Court arranged a conciliation conference under
Environment Court Act 1979
(NSW) (LEC Act) between the parties, which was
held on 4 November 2025.
the conciliation conference, the parties reached agreement as to acceptable
terms of a decision in the proceedings. This decision
involved the Court
upholding the appeal and granting development consent to the development
application subject to conditions.
part of this agreement, pursuant to
Environmental Planning and
Assessment Regulation 2021
(NSW) (EPA Regulation), the Council agreed to the
applicant amending the development application to adequately address their
contentions.
s 34(3) of the LEC Act, I must dispose of the proceedings in accordance with the
parties’ decision if that decision is
one that the Court could have made
in the proper exercise of its functions. The parties’ decision involves
the Court exercising
the function under s 4.16 of the EPA Act to grant consent
to the development application. There are jurisdictional prerequisites
be satisfied before this function can be exercised, which the parties identified
and explained. From this I note the following
development application was made with the written consent of the owner of the
application was adequately notified from 20 January to 3 February 2025. No
submissions were received in this time.
4.6 of the State Environmental Planning Policy (Resilience and Hazards)
2021 (SEPP R&H) requires the consent authority
to consider whether the site
is contaminated, and if so, whether it will be suitable for the intended use.
Based on the parties’
submissions and the information contained in
the Statement of Environmental Effects, prepared by Minto Planning Services
December 2024 (SEE), I note that there is no change of use proposed. I
further note that there is no evidence of potentially contaminating
nor any likely contamination, and I accept that the land is suitable for the
proposed development.
small portion of the south-east of the site is mapped as ‘proximity area
for coastal wetlands’ pursuant to s 2.8 of
the SEPP R&H. From the
parties’ submission and the letter by Minto Planning Services dated 29
October 2025, I accept that
the development is not within the mapped proximity
area, and that the proposed development will not significantly impact on any of
the matters listed in s 2.8(1).
portion of the site is also mapped as ‘coastal environment area’
pursuant to s 2.10 of the SEPP R&H. The SEE demonstrates
consideration of
the matters listed in s 2.10(1), and from which I accept that the proposed
development meets the requirements of
s 2.10(2). A further portion is mapped as
‘coastal use area’ and again, on the basis of the SEE and the
submission I accept that the matters listed in s 2.11(1)(a) have
been considered, and that the proposed development meets the requirements
2.11(1)(b) and (c).
site is located within the Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment, which is a regulated
catchment pursuant to Ch 6 of the State Environmental
Planning Policy
(Biodiversity and Conservation) 2021 (SEPP B&C). From the
parties’ submission, the agreed conditions of
consent and the SEE, I
accept that the requirements of Ch 6 of SEPP B&C relating to water quality
and quantity (s 6.6), aquatic
ecology (s 6.7), and flooding (s 6.8) are met
by the proposed development. I further accept that the proposed development does
affect public access to and from natural waterbodies (s 6.9), is not
likely to have any adverse environmental impact on any adjacent
local government
areas (s 6.10), is not a water-dependant use, and will not cause a conflict with
other land uses (s 6.11). Finally,
for the same reasons I accept that the impact
of the development on the scenic quality of the Riverine Scenic Area will be
subject site is zoned RU2 Rural Landscape under the Hawkesbury Local
Environmental Plan 2012 (HLEP), within which development
for the purposes of
animal boarding or training establishments is permissible with consent. The
proposed development is consistent
with the objectives of this zone.
to HLEP cl 4.3, a maximum building height of 10m applies to the subject site.
The proposed development complies with this
development standard.
site is mapped within the flood planning area. From the Flood Emergency Response
Plan and the Flood Report, both by GRC Hydro
dated October 2025, and from the
parties’ submissions, I accept that the impact of the structure and
associated earthworks
on flood behaviour is minimal. I further accept that, when
considered against the flood-related matters listed in HLEP cl 5.21(3),
development meets the requirements of cl 5.21(2).
to HLEP cl 6.1, the site is identified as Class 1, 4 and 5 on the Acid Sulfate
Soils Map. The works are located on the area
mapped as Class 5, however from the
parties’ submission and the amended architectural drawings by David Jones
Building and
Landscape Design, I accept that excavation is minimal, and that the
proposed works are not likely to lower the water table below
1 metre Australian
Height Datum.
site is partially mapped as containing biodiversity on the Terrestrial
Biodiversity Map pursuant to HLEP cl 6.4. From the parties’
submissions
and the assessment within the SEE, I accept that the matters listed in HLEP cl
6.4 (3) have been considered, and the
development meets the requirements for
terrestrial biodiversity in cl 6.4(4).
the parties’ submission and the SEE, I accept that all services that are
essential for the development are available, or
that adequate arrangements have
been made to make them available when required.
these reasons, I am satisfied that the parties’ decision is one that the
Court could have made in the proper exercise of
its functions, and accordingly I
am required under s 34(3) of the LEC Act to dispose of the proceedings in
accordance with the parties’
