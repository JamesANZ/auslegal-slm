Hoffmann, Henrik Norsk --- "Bryde Andersen: IT-Retten" [2003] IntTBLawRw 18; (2003) 8 International Trade and Business Law Review 434
By Mads Bryde Andersen,
Forlaget It-Retten, Copenhagen,
2001, ISBN 87-988580-0-9
This book is one of the most complete presentations of the Danish IT law ever
made. Dr jur Mads Bryde Andersen has been a Professor
at Law at the University
of Copenhagen since 1991, and he is one of the leading scholars in the area of
IT law in the Danish legal
professioon Professor Andersen is also involved in
several IT law institutions both in Denmark and abroad.
is a thorough examination of legislation and case law
regarding IT law issues in Denmark. The book’s 936 pages have been divided
into four main parts. The first part is an introduction to IT law, with a
general explanation of the common problems within this
modern law discipline.
Besides a description of the historical development of the computer and IT law,
and problems in regard to
evidence and jurisprudence, a very useful explanatory
chapter on the technical aspects of computers and how they work has been
in Part 1. In Part 2, Dr Andersen goes through the various intellectual
property rights and the consequences that the introduction
of information
technology has had on these legal disciplines. Part 3 is probably of least
relevance for non-Danish readers. Here,
the focus is on the marketing and
treatment/ processing of personal information. The last part of the book
discusses the legal problems
that can occur when a contract regarding
information technology products is entered into, or when a contract is entered
into by the
use of information technology.
also contains a very useful dictionary on the technological
terms used in information technology, and in the spirit of technology
book describes, it is available for private use on www.it-retten.dk.
As with all the other books written by Professor Mads Bryde Andersen,
is easy to read. He makes use of simple but very precise
language, which allows the reader to focus on the important issue, IT law,
is very well described in the book.
One very user friendly aspect, which is especially expressed apparent in the
second part of the book, is the way Dr Andersen first
presents the general rules
of a subject, for example, copyright law (Chapter 6), and then explains the
unique characteristics of
this branch of law in regard to information
technology. The fact that Professor Andersen, in his discussion of the
requirements for
a copyright protectable computer program, also examines whether
or not programming macros and hyperlinks are computer programs, shows
how thorough and complex this book is.
Due to the numerous discussions in
the book is a good
starting point for any research regarding information technology law in Denmark,
as well as the rest of Scandinavia.
The rapidly increasing use of the Internet has made it more important for
legal systems and lawyers all over the world to find more
uniform approaches to
legislation regarding information technology in order to ensure the rights of
the parties involved in this
business. Two main issues are contract law and
intellectual property law. Professor Andersen has taken up the challenge by
foreign law and then comparing it with the Danish approach.
Usually the interest of legal literature is within the jurisdiction which the
literature presents. However, Professor Mads Bryde Andersen’s
is the exception that proves the rule. Due to the fact that he
is constantly comparing the Danish legislation and case law with foreign
information technology is an implementation of European
Union directives,
is of high interest to most lawyers and legal scholars working
with information technology law on a regular basis. Hopefully, this
book will be translated into English so that non-Danish speaking readers will
have the opportunity to enjoy this extremely
relevant and interesting
presentation.
