SOLICITORS:
Ryan Murdoch O’Regan Lawyers for the applicant
GLR Law for the respondent
[1] This hearing arises out of orders made by Judge Jarro for
the appointment of statutory trustees for sale of property owned by
applicant and the respondent. The real property register records the applicant
as having a 75 per cent share in the property
as tenant in common with the
respondent who holds a 25 per cent share or one-quarter interest. The property
was ultimately sold
by the trustees. His Honour’s orders made in February
2024 were for 75 per cent of the net proceeds to be paid to the applicant
relevantly, the trustees’ costs and the registered mortgage debt, and the
balance of 25 per cent of the net proceeds
to be held pending further order of
[2] That 25 per cent related to the interest of the respondent as
registered proprietor as tenant in common. His Honour made an order
against the respondent for resisting the appointment of the statutory trustees.
Those costs have been agreed and paid from
the remaining 25 per cent share,
leaving $120,601.04 which is presently held by the applicant’s solicitors
in their trust account.
[3] The matter came on before me today on an
application for the disbursal of the remaining funds. The applicant sought two
adjustments
to the position which would inure based on the registered interest
of the respondent:
(a) The first was that the respondent pay the whole of the
costs of the carrying out of the duties of the trustees;
(b) The second was
that the payment balance of the mortgage should not have been out of the gross
proceeds of sale but should have
been allocated entirely to the
respondent’s share, and that an adjustment for that should now be
[4] The respondent, for her part, opposed both orders and, also
filed extensive material relating to a foreshadowed claim by her that
applicant had held a quarter of the property on constructive trust for her and
that that interest could be traced into the net
proceeds of sale. The
respondent did not urge that that matter be determined today but it was a matter
that was sought to be agitated
on pleadings. In that sense, I have before me
all the matters which the two parties presently seek to agitate, not only in
of the distribution of funds but in respect of rights and liabilities
arising out of their joint ownership of the property.
[5] The respondent
raised further argument which related to her ouster from the property by a
temporary protection order which was
made in July 2023. The effect of this order
meant that the respondent did not have access to the co-owned property for well
two years. One could well imagine that if this matter went to pleadings,
some adjustment would be sought in respect of that, and,
indeed, once the
parties started looking at it, one can imagine other matters of adjustment would
ultimately be pleaded.
[6] I was able to determine the first point raised
by the applicant on the material before me, which was that the respondent should
pay the costs not just of the unsuccessful opposition to the appointment of
trustees for sale but also the costs of the trustees
themselves. Based on the
circumstances and having heard submissions, I reject that argument. It seems to
me that it was inevitable
that statutory trustees would have had to be appointed
because of the complete breakdown in the relationship of the co-owners. It
not possible on the material to decide that one or the other person bears all
the responsibility for that and, frankly, that is
rarely the case. Even if it
were, it seems to me the underlying policy of the statutory trust for sale
process is to provide a solution
to a deadlock between co-owners, and the court
should be slow where that solution is availed of to impose the costs of it on
of the co-owners.
[7] In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that
this is the sort of exceptional case where the costs of the trust for sale
be borne by one party, whatever might be the position in respect of the
unsuccessful attempt to oppose the appointment of a trustee.
applicant’s argument about the mortgage can be encapsulated in this way.
It is uncontested that the mortgage as between
the applicant and respondent was
to be the respondent’s obligation. On sale, the capital amount of the
mortgage remained about
$206,000, and Mr Hughes submitted, with good
reason, that if the mortgage debt was the contribution of the respondent, then,
extent that capital had not been advanced by way of repayment of the
capital of the mortgage, it should come out of the respondent’s
[9] There was a strong argument in favour of that approach except for this.
If it were the case that the whole of that sum should
be treated as the capital
of the respondent, then the respondent provided something like 45 per cent of
the purchase price, entitling
her to 45 per cent of the capital gain and 45 per
cent ownership interest.
[10] It is not necessarily as straightforward as
that, but complicating the applicant’s argument about the mortgage is the
by the applicant that the respondent’s 75 per cent
interest represented her capital contribution in cash, plus a half-share
mortgage, which supports the 75/25 split. The applicant cannot really, at the
same time, say that the whole of the mortgage
should be laid at the door of the
respondent, yet defend the rationality of the 75/25 split. It seemed to me then
that the only
way to resolve that conflict would be with a trial.
suggested to the parties that, looking at the range of issues and difficulties,
they might consider accepting as a solution
roughly $85,000 of the balance for
the respondent and $35,000 of the remaining balance to the applicant as a
practical way to resolve
their disputes, and thereby avoid the whole of the
$120,000 being eaten up by legal costs.
[12] The parties were able to agree
on that settlement. By these reasons, I can record the parties’ formal
positions, communicated
to the court through their legal representatives on
instructions, that each will accept the distribution of the net proceeds in the
way I proposed (subject to a slight clarification of the amounts) in full
satisfaction of all claims they might have against each
other arising out of
their joint ownership of the property or the causes of action and claims raised
in the affidavits filed in this
proceeding. I describe that position in the
presence of representatives for both sides, reflecting, as I understand it, the
that has been reached.
[13] In those circumstances, I order that
$85,425.74 of the $120,601.04 held in the applicant’s solicitors’
trust account
be paid to the respondent, and $35,175.30 of the funds held on
trust be paid to the applicant. I make no order as to costs of today’s
