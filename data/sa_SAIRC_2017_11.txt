Introduction
enterprise agreement known as the
Treasury Wine Estates Central SA Region
Vineyards Enterprise Agreement 2014-2017
(the Agreement) which operated from
15 October 2014 governed the applicant’s employment.
interaction of clauses of the Agreement namely cl 34.7 and cl 36 were in
34.7 states:
“34. Shift work
34.7 Where a shift does not operate for 5 consecutive starts and an employee
works part or all of their ordinary time outside the
span of ordinary hours,
those hours will be paid at the rate of time-and-a-half for the first 2 hours
and double-time thereafter.”
“36. Notice of starting times (non vintage)
Unless otherwise agreed between the employee and the company, no change in a
weekly employee’s starting time shall be made
unless 48 hours notice is
given to the employee affected by the change, except during vintage when clause
32.7 of this agreement
will apply.”
applicant’s case is that where a shift doesn’t operate for five
consecutive starts overtime rates should be paid for
any hours worked outside
the span of ordinary hours regardless of how much notice is given. As the
respondent notes in its outline
the applicant’s contention is that cl 34.7
operates on a freestanding basis and cl 36 has no work to do in relation to
respondent’s position is that cl 34.7 operates in conjunction with (and
subject to) clause 36. That is, cl 34.7 applies
only where:
a change is made
to the weekly roster that results in an employee not performing a shift or day
work on 5 consecutive days (ie less
than 5 consecutive “starts”);
the respondent
has been unable to provide 48 hours’ notice of a change to the
employee’s start time (as clause 36 requires).
The hearing
applicant was called to give evidence.
indicated that he had been employed by the respondent as a vineyard worker since
February 2005 based at the Kalimna vineyard, Barossa
described the vintage period as the period when grapes are picked or harvested
and the non-vintage period covered the rest of the
working year.
the non-vintage period the applicant said he could work day shift, afternoon
shift or night shift. A roster for work was provided
on a weekly basis which
usually came out on the Thursday prior to the commencement of the shift the
following week.
The roster is put
up on the notice board.
vintage the shifts usually consist of day shift or night shift. A roster is
given normally the week before. The applicant was asked
January 2015 to 17 January 2015 (the relevant period). The applicant said this
was non-vintage.
applicant said that the roster for the week of 12 January came out the previous
week he thought on Thursday. It provided for day
work to be performed.
applicant prepared a summary of payments which also contained the hours worked
for the relevant period. This document became Exhibit
A2 and is set out

*Bold and underlined payments = disputed payments
applicant said during the working day on Monday 12 January he was approached by
the assistant manager (Tim Malone) and was asked
if he would be prepared to work
later in the week performing spraying duty which would involve a 7.00pm start to
a 6.00am finish.
The applicant said this change in shifts was confirmed in the
afternoon of Monday 12 January and it involved a total of five employees
including himself.
the applicant received his payslip following the relevant period he did not
think that he had been paid properly. Subsequently
a meeting took place which
involved the following:
George Taylor, vineyard manager;
Tim Malone, assistant manager; and
Margaret McDonald office supervisor.
The applicant attended together with a co-worker, Daniel Barker.
topic of the meeting was the correct payment for the relevant period. The
applicant and Mr Barker suggested that they would be
entitled to penalties
because they did not work for five consecutive shifts. He said the response was
that they had five starts and
it constituted five consecutive shifts.
applicant said that he and Mr Barker brought up the fact that 48 hours’
notice to change start time was not given and also
the fact that the normal
hours of work for shift work in a non-vintage period namely between 7.00 pm on
Sunday to 12 midnight Friday
were not worked.
agreed that ultimately all payments were made except for the penalty rates and
disputed payments set out in Exhibit
applicant said this was the first occasion since the agreement took effect that
he had been asked to change shifts mid-week. He
also said it was the first time
that he could remember being asked to change shifts mid-week during a
non-vintage period. He did
recall being asked to change shifts mid-week during a
vintage period on at least two
applicant when cross-examined agreed that during non-vintage times the work
duties are to a large extent predictable and are able
Largely it is day shift
supplemented by afternoon or night shift depending on the requirements that
management has at a particular
time. In most cases the respondent will be able
to predict the requirement for afternoon or night shift to be worked and to
people accordingly.
applicant agreed that he would volunteer to perform afternoon or night shift if
the opportunity arose and he also agreed that
the respondent to the extent that
it can rostered such shifts for five consecutive starts for the following
applicant also agreed that occasionally due to weather or environmental
conditions the respondent changed shifts and labour allocations
An example of the
respondent needing to allocate labour differently to the way that it was
scheduled in the roster on the previous
Thursday was when there was a risk of
downy mildew occurring, and chemical spraying was required to manage the
applicant agreed that at the time of the relevant period, the respondent was
faced with the risk of botrytis infection due to
a rain event over the weekend
of 10 and 11 January. There was a need to require employees at short notice to
work different shifts
to get the necessary chemical spraying done to manage the
risk and this is what occurred during the relevant
applicant in his capacity as a union delegate was involved in negotiations with
respect to the proposed 2014 enterprise agreement
for the central region. He
agreed that the respondent made it clear to the negotiating parties that it
regarded the 48 hours’
notice provision as applicable to cl 34.7 and the
respondent also informed the negotiating parties that this had always been the
respondent’s position under previous enterprise
agreements.
applicant recalled a meeting chaired by the manager George Taylor and attended
by Darren Scragg, Human Resources Manager. Mr Scragg
gave a presentation at that
meeting relating to cl 34.7, the consecutive shifts clause, and explained the
company’s position
that the notice provision of 48 hours applied to that
respondent called George Taylor employed by the respondent in the Barossa area
as a vineyard manager. He had held that position
since April
Mr Taylor gave evidence as to additional shifts being
allocated in order to cover activities in a certain span of time. He said if
there was the threat of a condition like downy mildew it was important that they
could react quickly and get on and spray a curative
spray for that disease. He
said it was a definite need that he has the flexibility to get people to carry
out such work if the season
or conditions
vintage he indicated that they try not to change the rosters in order to avoid
disrupting the work program. However, because
of weather conditions or ripening
quicker than expected it may be necessary part way through the week to make a
decision to work
day and night shift to get a certain amount of fruit off the
vines and into the winery.
Taylor recalled the briefing meeting as regards the 2014 enterprise agreement
negotiations.
Mr Scragg gave a
presentation and part of that presentation was the respondent’s view of
how the clause is interpreted, namely
if enough notice is given shift rates only
would apply but not penalty rates. That position is consistent with the
respondent’s
also recalled the discussion concerning the respondent raising the issue with
the union and that the union had not challenged the
respondent’s
said a point of contention was raised at the meeting because on several
occasions prior to that day workers had expressed concern
of the clauses.
Taylor agreed that during the course of the negotiations leading up to the 2014
agreement the respondent had a certain view as
to the operation of the clauses
in question whereas the employees disagreed with the respondent’s
interpretation of the operation
The parties’ submissions
applicant by reference to Exhibit A2 referred to the relevant period and for
what hours the night shift or double-time rate was
claimed totalling a
differential of $221.30.
change to starting times was a rare event in the non-vintage period.
34.7 of the agreement refers to “5 consecutive starts”. There is no
disagreement that the three night shifts did
not operate for five consecutive
starts. The entitlement to the penalty rate arises where “an employee
works part or all of
their ordinary time outside the span or ordinary
applicant referred to cl 31 of the agreement as regards the concept of
“span of ordinary hours”. Clause 31.1 of the
“Employees shall work an average of 38 ordinary
hours each week. The weekly span of ordinary hours for employees other than
shift workers shall be between 6.00am to 6.00pm Monday to Friday both
inclusive.”
As the applicant pointed out cl 32 which deals with vintage working arrangements
refers to the span of ordinary hours. Clause 32.5
“During vintage the span of ordinary hours for shift workers shall be
between 7.00pm Sunday and 12.00 noon on Saturday, provided
that those ordinary
hours worked before mid-night on a Sunday are paid at double-time and after
mid-night at the appropriate shift
work rate specified in this
agreement.”
31 goes on to indicate how the span of ordinary hours may be varied and the fact
that up to ten ordinary hours can be performed
on any single day within the span
of ordinary hours and also deals with work commenced outside the span of
ordinary hours.
applicant contended that the natural and ordinary meaning of the words that
appear in cl 34.7 comes down to this:
where a shift
does not operate for five consecutive starts the clause is triggered;
if therefore an
employee works part or all of their ordinary time outside the span of ordinary
hours that is to say outside 6.00am
to 6.00pm Monday to Friday (cl 31.1) those
hours are to be paid at the rate of time-and-a-half for the first two hours and
double-time
thereafter.
applicant then went on to deal with what it was that he contended that the
respondent was putting forward. This was said to be
that cl 34.7 needs to
be read subject to cl 36. When it is read subject to cl 36 one replaces the
phrase “outside the span
of ordinary hours” with some concept
derived from section 2 of the agreement.
2 provisions of the agreement do not describe anything as a span of ordinary
is nothing in cl 34.7 which suggests that it needs to be read in any way subject
to section 2. It is to be noted that section
1 of the agreement is to apply and
when there is an inconsistency between section 1 and section 2 section 1 is to
is nothing in cl 34.7 about adequacy of notice or otherwise. Clause 34.7 cannot
be read as being somehow subject to cl 36.
plain and ordinary meaning of the words used in cl 34.7 are to be given full
force and effect. They are meant to deter an employer
from imposing upon the
employee an interrupted pattern of work.
the High Court decision of
Amcor Limited v Construction, Forestry, Mining and
Energy Union,
the majority
felt that the text and context of a clause within an agreement should be
considered when determining the correct interpretation
applicant also referred to the often cited decision of Justice Madgwick in
Kucks v CSR Ltd.
applicant emphasised from the decision of
the fact that:
“the task remains one of interpreting a document
produced by another or others. A court is not free to give effect to some
derived notion of what would be fair or just, regardless of what has
been written into the award. Deciding what an existing award
means is a process
quite different from deciding, as an arbitral body does, what might fairly be
put into an award. So, for example,
ordinary or well-understood words are in
general to be accorded their ordinary or usual
purpose and meaning of cl 34.7 as advanced makes sense when regard is had to cl
34 generally. Clause 34.1 provides that a 15%
loading for all ordinary hours
worked will be paid to employees required to work afternoon shift. Clause 34.2
provides that a 20%
loading for all ordinary hours worked will be paid to
employees required to work night shift. Clause 34.3 provides that by mutual
agreement between the employee and the respondent a change of start time can be
agreed. Clause 34.4 allows for an agreement in writing
whereby an employee
working afternoon or night shift can elect not to rotate to day shift. On the
other hand if they agree to a rotation
then there is a reference to a higher
shift loading in Section 2 of the agreement. In short cl 34 recognises there is
a disability
working the afternoon shift, a greater disability in
working night shift and an even greater disability in agreeing to work
shifts. Consistent with these clauses is the rationale underlying
cl 34.7 which provides for an even greater rate of pay where there
disruption in the working pattern.
applicant further contended that the purpose and meaning of cl 34.7 is apparent
read alongside cl 32 which deals with the vintage working
arrangements. Clause 32.11 makes it clear as to what should occur in
circumstances
of a change of times of shifts. When one contrasts cl 34 and cl
34.7 with the much clearer and more flexible arrangements
the applicant’s construction of cl 34.7 makes sense in context.
36 underpins the respondent’s argument. Clause 36 states:
“Unless otherwise agreed between the employee and
the company, no change in a weekly employee’s starting time shall be
unless 48 hours notice is given to the employee affected by the change, except
during vintage when clause 32.7 of this agreement
Clause 32.7 deals with the 12 hour notice period for change in
employee’s starting time when vintage is happening.
is nothing in cl 36 to indicate that it is to govern the operation of
34.7 is addressed at the additional disability associated with working in an
interrupted fashion on a particular shift. Clause
36 is there to ensure that
employees are certain about when it is they will work so that an employee can
organise their lives outside
of work. The two clauses are addressing different
things and that is why neither is subject to the other.
respondent’s argument is that they need cl 36 to give flexibility because
the ability to work is at the mercy of the weather
so therefore cl 36 needs to
govern cl 34.7. Clause 36 already gives the respondent far greater than standard
flexibility to move
people around. Most modern awards require seven days’
notice of a change of shift to be given. Section 2 of the agreement cl
contains such provision. Section 2 of course is subject to section 1. Therefore
cl 36 gives flexibility by reducing the notice
time from seven days to 48 hours.
During vintage there is the additional flexibility in cl 32.7 namely notice for
changing an employee’s
starting time is designated as twelve hours.
remedy provided by cl 36 where less than 48 hours’ notice is given has
nothing to do with the amount of payment someone
might be entitled to. The
remedy is that an employee is entirely free to accept or reject the requirement
for a change when they
are not given 48 hours’ notice.
interpretation of cl 34.7 as advocated by the applicant is also consistent with
the history of these clauses. Exhibit A1 is part
of the 2004 enterprise
agreement. Clause 12 refers to flexible working arrangements. Clause 12.5 refers
to notice of change of shift
and provides that:
“It is agreed that the notice to change shift
should be no less than 48 hours unless otherwise mutually
Clause 12.8.3 of the 2004 agreement provides:
“The provision set out hereunder will apply where
an afternoon or night shift does not continue for five consecutive days or
(a) Where an employee works part and/or all of their ordinary hours between
6.00pm and 6.00am, that employee will be paid for all
hours worked during that
working period (including ordinary hours) at the rate of time-and-a-half for the
first two hours and double-time
thereafter.”
The applicant maintained that if this particular clause applied to the
circumstance of this hearing the applicant would have been
paid the penalties.
Clause 12.8.3(b) provides:
“Despite paragraph (a) above the provisions of
clause 12.5 of this agreement will apply.”
In the context of the 2004 agreement what this meant was that if a notice to
change shift of no less than 48 hours was given it still
did not derogate from
the entitlement in paragraph (a) to be paid the penalty rates.
is how the 2004 agreement was understood to apply and this is borne out in
Exhibit A3 being a letter from the human resources
manager of the respondent
addressed to the LHMU dated 2 September 2004. Part of that letter
“Clause 12.8.3(b) provides for the notice of
change of shift to apply in circumstances where a shift does not continue for
consecutive periods. Therefore, employees are obliged to change shift if 48
hours’ notice is given, or can agree to a request
to change shift if the
notice is less than 48 hours. However, in either situation employees are only be
(sic) entitled to payment
for time worked, at the rates provided for in
12.8.3(a).”
The memorandum attached to the letter of 2 September 2004 makes it clear that
whenever there is a change of shift and a worker works
part or all of their
hours outside the hours of 6.00am to 6.00pm they get penalty payments for the
hours worked whether or not the
change is from night shift to day shift or day
shift to night shift.
the 2005 agreement the vintage provisions were inserted as well as the notion of
span of ordinary hours. There was also the notice
of starting time outside of
the vintage period which is essentially the clause which still exists as clause
36. What is not in the
2005-08 agreement is the five non-consecutive shift
provision that subsequently emerges in the 2011 agreement in the form of cl 34.7
essentially in the same terms as it currently is. The one essential change is
the introduction of the notion of the span of ordinary
R3 is an email from Mr Peter Milton of the respondent to Mr Kevin Ralph of
the LHMU. It is clear that the memorandum attached
relates to the vintage
period. It is submitted that what the memorandum does is reinforce the
applicant’s position concerning
cl 36 which is confined to the amount of
notice in non-vintage times and has nothing to do with the appropriate amount of
2004 communication and the 2007 communication are the extent of communications
from the respondent to the union. The 2004 representation
conforms with what the
applicant says is his entitlement. The 2007 communication is confined to the
terms under the vintage period.
57 While the respondent asserts that there is some common understanding of the
provisions the courts are very cautious about applying
such an analysis. There
has always been great caution about relying on some asserted common
understanding and that is even greater
presently because of the nature of the
agreement-making process. Cases in this regard include
Health Services Union
v Ballarat Health Services
Transport Workers Union of Australia v Coles Supermarkets
Motor Corporation v Marmara
applicant’s position is that there is no common understanding of the
position namely that provided someone has been given
sufficient notice they were
not entitled to the penalty rates provided for by cl 34.7. The 2004
communication is inconsistent with
that asserted understanding and there is
nothing in the 2007 communication which is consistent with that understanding.
that is crystal clear in negotiations leading to the current agreement
is that the employees and the union did not agree to the interpretation
34.7 and its interaction with cl 36 as proposed by the respondent.
ordinary plain natural meaning of the words used in cl 34.7 provides that if you
are required to work shifts which do not extend
for five starts you are entitled
to penalty payments for any hours falling outside the span of ordinary hours.
That is consistent
with the rest of cl 34. It is consistent with the absence of
any textual support in either cl 34.7 or cl 36 or elsewhere that cl
be subject to some notice provision. It is consistent with the evident
industrial purpose of addressing these disrupted
shift times. It is consistent
with the history of the development of these agreements and the understanding of
the parties at the
two points in time where there was some written communication
from the respondent to the applicant.
Submissions of the respondent
respondent provided a written outline of submissions and made oral
submissions.
respondent agreed with the principles to apply in approaching the question of
construction. In its written outline of submissions
it provided a useful
overview as regards the principles of construction
“5. The primary task is to give effect to the language
of the enterprise agreement.
“Interpretation is always a text-based
In doing so
“the search is for the meaning intended by the framer(s) of the
“the object as always is to objectively determine the intention of the
parties from the words of the
“purposive” approach should be adopted, as opposed to a narrow or
pedantic one. In that regard, the High Court in
emphasised the
need to use context to strive to find the “industrial purpose”
behind the disputed provision.
An available construction should be preferred if it “contributes to a
sensible industrial outcome such as should be attributed
to the parties who
negotiated and executed the
agreement”.
context, “it is important to keep in mind therefore the desirability of a
construction, if it is reasonably available,
that will operate fairly towards
both parties”.
Accordingly,
the contested issues of construction are to be resolved on the text of the 2014
EA, understood in the context of any
relevant broader objective circumstances.
Recourse may not be had to evidence of the parties statements and actions
reflecting their
actual (that is subjective) intentions and
expectations.
respondent stressed the need for a flexible workforce given the nature of the
respondent’s operation. Its operation as
covered by the agreement had two
distinct phases namely vintage and non-vintage. Clause 32 of the Agreement
deals with the vintage
working arrangements. Clause 32.1 states:
“The parties acknowledge that the vintage period
is crucial to wine production and that it is essential that there be additional
workplace flexibilities in this demanding
respondent made the point that as regards the interaction between notice and
consecutive shift provisions there is no relevant
point of distinction between
vintage and non-vintage.
will be occasions when management is not able to stick to the scheduled 5
consecutive starts during non-vintage times.
applicant commencing on Monday 12 January 2015 was involved in working
“day work” as distinct from a day shift. The
key difference was
that there was no paid lunch break. The applicant received half an hour as a
break but did not get paid. A shift
worker does get a paid meal break. Being a
day worker with unpaid meal breaks was the default position for all of the
Due to the demands vineyard workers were always able to be asked to
work shift work.
respondent made reference to the vintage working arrangements set out in cl 32,
and in particular the interaction between cl 32.7
(notice for changing an
employee’s starting time is 12 hours) and cl 32.11 which refers to a shift
not continuing for five
consecutive starts. Its position was that cl 36 speaks
to cl 34.7 just as cl 32.7 speaks to cl 32.11. With the need for flexibility
mind cl 32.7 and cl 32.11 must be read in conjunction. This is in the context
of the vintage period. The same argument applies
to non-vintage and cl 36 must
be read in conjunction with cl 34.7.
requirement to give 48 hours’ notice under cl 36 to change the starting
time alleviates the need to pay the onerous penalties
that are prescribed in cl
the appropriate notice is given the applicable loading is that the loading which
relates to the shift that the employee is required
to work. For the night shift
the applicant was required to work it was a 20 per cent
the respondent stated in its written outline:
“cl 36 ensures that an employee is provided with
an appropriate period of notice to prepare for a change to their working hours.
Where the respondent does not comply with cl 36, cl 34.7 imposes a (higher)
shift penalty”.
It goes onto say:
“such a construction is unremarkable. It is not
uncommon in industrial instruments to modify the employer’s ability to
transfer an employee from day work to shift work, by requiring notice of the
change, and prescribing the payment of shift penalties
where the prescribed
notice is not
respondent in its written outline then contended that once it is understood that
it can allocate employees to perform shift work,
subject to providing
appropriate notice under cl 36, a complete answer to the applicant’s
case emerges. The span of ordinary
hours to which cl 34.7 refers moves from 6.00
am – 6.00 pm Monday to Friday as set out in cl 31.1 to 12.00 midnight
to 12.00 midnight Friday set out in cl 6.4.2.1 of section 2. This is
because the ordinary hours contained in cl 31.1 are confined
to employees
other than shift workers. Clause 6.4.2.1 of section 2 sets out the ordinary
hours for an employee performing shift work
in the non-vintage period. As to the
applicant’s alternative claim under cl 6.3.1 the applicant is properly
considered a shift
worker when working the night shift so cl 6.3.1(c) has no
application.
the agreement employees work a five-day week within a 6.00 am – 6.00 pm
span of ordinary hours which may be varied by
agreement to 4.00 am – 8.00
pm. During the non-vintage period shift work can be utilised between midnight
Sunday and midnight
Friday. During vintage shift work can be utilised between
midnight Sunday and noon on Saturday. Shift work is commonly utilised during
vintage period and occasionally during the non-vintage period as weather and
operational needs dictate.
2004 communication and the 2007 communication between the respondent and the
union show consistency on the part of the respondent
in its approach to applying
the shift penalty and notice provisions. The respondent’s construction
should be preferred and
the application should be dismissed.
Consideration
High Court of Australia dealt with the approach to interpretation of awards and
industrial agreements in
(supra). In
at par 30 their
Honours Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ when discussing the clause under
consideration (cl 55.1.1) stated:
“Clause 55.1.1 must be read in context. It is
necessary, therefore, to have regard not only to the text clause 55.1.1, but
to a number of other matters: first, the other provisions made by clause
55; secondly, the text and operation of the agreement both
as a whole and by
reference to other particular provisions made by it; and, thirdly, the
legislative background against which the
agreement was made and in which it was
to operate.”
one needs to consider the content of the relevant clause together with the
relationship of that clause to other clauses,
the text and operation of the
agreement and the background. Effect must be given to the meaning of the
agreement as expressed in
the terms that it uses. The agreement should be
construed to make it operate “fairly towards both

a clause that deals with shift work. It is
located in section 1 of the
“Where there is any inconsistency between section
1 and section 2 or 3 of the agreement, section 1 shall prevail to the extent
inconsistency”.
34.1 makes reference to afternoon shift as defined by section 2 or section 3 of
the agreement. Section 3 is not relevant to
the applicant. A 15% loading is to
be paid for all ordinary hours worked. Clause 6.4.1.2 located in section 2
states that “afternoon
shift must start between 2 PM and 6 PM.”
34.2 makes reference to nightshift as defined by section 2. A 20% loading is to
be paid for all ordinary hours worked. Clause
6.4.1.3 states that
“nightshift must start between 10 PM and 2 AM.” Clause 6.4.2 states
that employees may be employed
as shift workers in any one of the shifts
mentioned at any time of the year other than vintage between 12 midnight Sunday

“outside the vintage span of ordinary
hours”. Clause 32.5 states
that “during vintage the span of ordinary hours for shift workers shall be
between 7 PM Sunday
and 12 noon on Saturday”.
34.7 contains a reference to “outside the span of ordinary hours”.
Clause 31.1 makes reference to “the weekly
span of ordinary hours for
employees other than shift workers shall be between 6 AM to 6 PM, Monday to
Friday, both inclusive”.

there being a need to undertake spraying duties. The
different shift occurred
from Wednesday 14 January from 7.00 pm to 6.00 am. As the Court understands
Exhibit A2, for the work done
on Wednesday 14 January the applicant was paid at
the rate of time and a half for the first two hours and double-time thereafter,
in other words in accordance with cl 34.7.
during the relevant period the applicant came under a period of notice of 48
hours or more of a change in his starting
time. The respondent then proceeded to
pay the applicant at a night shift rate of 20% of base

terms of the agreement. It is however required to
