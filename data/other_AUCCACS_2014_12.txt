Appeal Outcome
Appeal allowed, proceeding remitted to the District Court to be reheard by
a different Judge and that on the remitted hearing, the
sentencing Judge should
be directed that a section 9C conference be convened before proceeding to
resentence the defendant.[120]
Consideration of whether section 9C of the
Criminal Law (Sentencing) Act
(SA) engages section 10 of the
Racial Discrimination Act
Whether section 9C of the
Criminal Law (Sentencing) Act 1988
“special measure” within the meaning of
Discrimination Act 1975
The appellant/offender Anthony Eric Grose entered the victim’s home on
the night of the 17 February 2012 and stole a handbag.
He then tried to use the
credit card from the handbag to obtain approximately $80 worth of tobacco at a
service station. When asked
by the attendant for his identification, he fled,
taking two pouches of tobacco with him.[14]
Following pleas of guilty, the offender requested that the sentencing Judge
convene an Aboriginal sentencing conference pursuant to
s 9C of the
Law (Sentencing Act) 1988
(SA).[3] The prosecution did not oppose the
holding of a conference on the basis that the defendant is Aboriginal.[15] The
Judge declined
to do so,[3] observing that ‘[t]here are no tribal issues
to be discussed or determined’ and that they would not be assisted
conference.[15]
The offender faced imprisonment for a period of six years and eight months to
commence from 20 July 2012, to be served cumulatively
upon a sentence of
imprisonment of 13 months, which the defendant was serving at the time.[5]
On appeal, the offender submitted that the Judge had erred in not convening
an Aboriginal sentencing conference in the exercise of
his sentencing
discretion,[6] in setting a non-parole period which comprised too great a
portion of the head sentence, and in imposing
a total sentence which was
manifestly excessive.[6]
The offender was a 47 year old Aboriginal man at the date of offending.[8]
The eldest son of a family of four children born to his
mother with two
different fathers, his parents separated when he was two. He did not have the
opportunity to develop a relationship
with his father. His mother provided a
‘safe and secure’ environment.[8] The offender was expelled from
school when aged
15 years and spent time in juvenile detention.[9]
The offender led a ‘nomadic existence’ with an ‘aimless
lifestyle’ of drug and alcohol abuse.[10] The offender
had had a number of
relationships. One partner had died of a drug overdose four years after giving
birth to his first child when
the offender was 23.[10] He found accommodation
through Aboriginal Housing and began a new relationship with another partner who
committed suicide due to significant mental health issues when the offender was
aged ‘about’ 30 years.[11] He developed
a heroin addiction in
an attempt to deal with his grief and committed offences to fund this habit.[11]
When aged 35 years, the offender
went into an opiate replacement program but
began using methamphetamine.[12] When aged 42 the offender formed a relationship
his current partner. In 2010 the couple were ‘deeply saddened’
by the abortion, on medical advice, of the baby the offender’s
partner was
carrying, which led the offender to the abuse of prescribed medications.[12] The
offender has criminal antecedents extending
over 30 years. They include a range
of offences, including convictions for disorderly behaviour in a public place,
theft, motor vehicle
offences, building breaking and felony, unlawfully on
premises, resist police, drug possession, social security fraud and breaches

Sentencing Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background
of the offender and/ or indicators of disadvantage Aboriginal
background:
His Honour Gray J describes the ‘need to achieve individualised
justice,’[41] after recognising the ‘gross
overrepresentation’[41]
of Aboriginal people in the criminal justice
system, itself a product of the ‘prevalence’ of ‘risk factors
with criminal offending’ such as ‘unemployment, lack of
education and poor health.’[41]
His Honour notes that ‘[i]n being alive to cultural, social and
economic factors, it is unhelpful to resort to classifications
“tribal”, “semi-tribal” or
“urban,”’[42] because the ‘[f]actors relevant
sentencing Aboriginal defendants do not become irrelevant because a defendant
lives in an urban environment.’[42]
Section 9C Aboriginal sentencing conference:
Much of His Honour Gray J’s judgment concerns the characterisation of s
Criminal Law (Sentencing Act) 1988
(SA) as a “special
measure” within the meaning of
Racial Discrimination
. This follows the High Court’s logic in
Maloney v The Queen
(2013) 298 ALR 308. All parties accepted that the Judge’s exercise of
discretion had miscarried,[107] and in failing to convene
an Aboriginal
sentencing conference the Judge had failed to recognise the ‘evident
purpose’ of the s 9C conferencing
procedure – to enable information
on those topics as are relevant to the particular offender to be before the
court through
a process that is culturally sensitive.[105]
His Honour’s discussion of the
Woods Royal Commission into
Aboriginal Deaths in Custody
is used to suggest a ‘systemic inadequacy
in the sentencing process as normally conducted.’[94] This is reflected
by Sulan J who notes that the ‘very purpose’ of convening a s
9C conference is to assist the sentencing judge in ‘better
understanding
the factors which may have contributed to an Aboriginal person’s
antisocial conduct.’[123]
Relevant passage(s):
[M]embership of a particular ethnic or other group becomes relevant when it
tells the court something about the offence or the offender
to the determination
of the appropriate penalty.[38]
Statistically, Aboriginal people are grossly overrepresented in the criminal
justice system. Further, risk factors associated with
criminal offending such as
unemployment, lack of education and poor health, which inhibit full
participation in community life, are
far more prevalent in relation to
Aboriginal people. While these statistical facts say nothing about an individual
before a sentencing
court, the fact that they are a relatively common experience
of Aboriginal defendants suggests a need for a sentencing court to be
the likelihood of their existence, to explore whether they are present, and, if
they are, to explore their relevance to
the offence and offender. The need to
achieve individualised justice requires as much.[41]
In being alive to cultural, social and economic factors, it is unhelpful to
resort to classifications such as “tribal”,
“semi-tribal” or “urban”. Resort to such classifications
creates a risk of applying those categories mechanically
and failing to unpack
the characteristics that the classification is intended to convey. Factors
relevant to sentencing Aboriginal
defendants do not become irrelevant because a
defendant lives in an urban environment.[42]
Further, there exist risk factors specific to Aboriginal people, including
forced removal, which have an intergenerational effect.
The earlier referred to material demonstrates a greater likelihood of
Aboriginal defendants being disengaged from the criminal justice
system than
non-Aboriginal defendants. This suggests a systemic inadequacy in the sentencing
process as normally conducted. The material
further demonstrates that risk
factors relevant to criminal offending are far more prevalent in relation to
Aboriginal people in
Australia, and that Aboriginal people are far more likely
to be in custody than non-Aboriginal Australians. This suggests that the
inadequacy is capable of adversely affecting a particular ethnic group in that
the courts are not fully informed of all factors relevant
to the determination
of the appropriate penalty. These matters demonstrate a need for measures to be
taken in relation to Aboriginal
people in order to ensure their equal enjoyment
of human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular, the right to equal
before organs administering justice.[94]
The legislation recognises that persons of Aboriginal descent may have issues
and factors in their lives which are not necessarily
easily understood or
revealed in the usual sentencing process.[122]
The very purpose of convening a s 9C conference is to assist the sentencing
Judge in better understanding the factors which may have
contributed to an
Aboriginal person’s antisocial conduct. The information may provide an
insight into the person’s conduct
which may not be appreciated by the
defendant. A conference which is held in a less formal atmosphere, where the
participants are
encouraged to discuss matters relevant to their offending and
their background in the presence of Elders who are alive to the cultural
which affect Aboriginal people, may assist the Judge in tailoring a sentence
appropriate to the offender.[123]
Grounds of appeal:
the Judge erred in not convening an Aboriginal sentencing conference pursuant to
s 9C of the
Criminal Law (Sentencing Act) 1988
(SA) in the exercise of
his sentencing discretion and failed to properly consider materials tendered on
behalf of the offender;[6]
the non-parole period of six years comprised too great a portion of the head
sentence;[6] and
imposing a total sentence of imprisonment which was manifestly
excessive.[6]
Decision/Appeal outcome:
the Judge erred in the exercise of his sentencing discretion;[108]
the non-parole period of six years is manifestly excessive;[119]
the total term of imprisonment faced by the offender of six years and eight
months is manifestly excessive;[119] and
the proceeding be remitted to the District Court to be reheard by a different
Judge and that on the remitted hearing, the sentencing
Judge should direct that
a s 9C conference be convened before proceeding to resentence the
defendant.[120]
