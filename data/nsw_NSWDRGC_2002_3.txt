LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES:
Regina: K. Thompson, Director of Public Prosecutions N.S.W
Offender: C. Grant, Legal Aid Commission of N.S.W
1. The argument before the Court today is whether the
applicant is a person who is an eligible person to enter a Drug Court program
or, alternatively, whether the Court ought, in its discretion, find it
appropriate for him to enter into a Drug Court program in
the light of the
nature of the offence with which he is charged.
2. The offence is an
offence of aggravated indecent assault that was committed in August of 2000. He
was sentenced for the offence
in February 2002 after an earlier conviction and
ordered to perform community service. He has breached that order and is before
for re-sentencing following the revocation of the community service
3. I am informed that further community service or periodic
detention as an alternative to full-time imprisonment would not be available
this offender, so it must be said that he is a person who is highly likely to
receive a prison sentence. It is an offence to
which he had pleaded guilty. It
is understood that he is a person who is dependent on prohibited drugs.
4. Therefore the question is whether he satisfies the remaining
eligibility criteria prescribed in the
Drug Court Act 1998
Subsection 5(2)
provides that:
“A person is not an eligible person if
the person is charged with:
offences relating to dealing with drugs;
offence involving violent conduct or sexual assault; or
any other prescribed
6. There are no offences prescribed for the purposes of
7. The next question is whether an offence against
Crimes Act 1900
is an offence that involves sexual assault.
Section 61M
provides that:
Any person who assaults another
person in circumstances of aggravation and at the time of or immediately before
or after the assault
commits an act of indecency on or in the presence of the
other person is liable to imprisonment.”
9. The circumstance of
aggravation in this case is that the age of the offender was under 16 years.
10. The defence argue that this offence is not an offence of
assault, it is one of
assault. It is argued that offences of
sexual assault and indecent assault are defined separately in the
. I am referred to
, which appears under the heading of “Sexual
Assault”, and which refers to sexual intercourse without consent.
headed “indecent assault”, suggesting that there is a distinction
under the law between offences involving sexual
assault and offences involving
indecent assault. My attention is drawn to the fact that an act of indecency is
defined broadly as
one in which right-minded people would consider to be
contrary to community standards of decency.
11. The contrary argument is
raised by the Crown. I am referred to the case of R. V. Harkin
(1989) 38 A Crim
where it is said that:
“The indecent assault must have some
sexual connotation which can be sufficiently derived from the body area of the
victim which
is touched by the accused or part of the accused used to do the
12. I am further referred to the second reading speech
of the Minister of Police on 27 October 1998 when the Drug Court Bill was being
debated where it was specifically said that those offenders who commit
and offences involving violent conduct will not be
13. It has been argued that, had it been intended that indecent
assault be precluded, this could have been stated. As it clearly was
not stated,
it was not intended to exclude this offence.
14. The other matter I have
been referred to is Chandler’s case which suggests that it is the elements
of the charge that are
significant, not the particular conduct. However, I do
not think one could ignore the particular conduct when deciding whether this
an offence that involves sexual assault.
15. The allegation to which the
offender has pleaded guilty is that he touched the breast of the victim and when
she tried to run
away he grabbed her and again touched her in the breast area.
It is argued that this is clearly conduct with a sexual connotation
therefore the offence is one involving sexual assault.
16. I am satisfied
that it is the intention of this legislation that s5(2) refer not only to
offences of sexual assaults which would
fall within
Crimes Act 1900
, (each of which involve sexual intercourse) but would
also include an assault that involved conduct with a sexual
connotation.
17. It is my finding in this case that the offence with
which the offender has been charged is an offence which involves sexual assault
within the meaning of those words in
Drug Court Act
therefore the offender is not person who is eligible to enter a Drug Court
