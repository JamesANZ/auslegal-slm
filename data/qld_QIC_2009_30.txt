[Extract from Queensland Government Industrial
dated 2 October, 2009, Vol. 192, No. 5, page
INDUSTRIAL COURT OF QUEENSLAND
Electrical Safety Act
- s. 186(2) - appeal against decision of industrial magistrate
W.H. Frier Building Contractors Pty Ltd AND Trevor William
Little (C/2009/26)
PRESIDENT HALL
24 September 2009
By a complaint made on 26 March 2009, the Appellant was charged with 24
contraventions of s. 27 of the
Electrical Safety Act 2002
(the Act) by
way of failing to discharge the electrical safety obligation at s. 307 of the
Act. The Appellant was also charged with
2 licensing offences under s. 57AA of
the Act. The charges related to the performance of electrical work by
unlicensed persons.
There was a plea of guilty to all charges. The Industrial
Magistrate, who applied the totality principle (see
Mill v The Queen
[1988] HCA 70
(1988) 166 CLR 59
at 62), imposed a fine of $85,000 and ordered the payment of
certain investigation expenses.
As sometimes happens when parties are not
legally represented, the Industrial Magistrate did not receive the assistance to
Honour was entitled. In the event amongst other things (and
importantly), the Industrial Magistrate who expressed concern about
rectification of defective electrical works did not appreciate that an
Improvement Notice had been issued and that a fine
had been imposed upon the
Appellant for non-compliance.
This Court has had considerable
assistance from Counsel in unscrambling the egg. I agree that the Appeal
against the quantum of the
fine must be allowed. Having regard to the
significant mitigating factors,
no previous convictions, timely
plea of guilty and cooperation with authorities, I accept that a fine of $40,000
Accordingly, the Court orders that:
1. The Appeal be
2. The penalty of $85,000 imposed by the Industrial Magistrate be set aside
and in lieu thereof a penalty of $40,000 to be paid within
12 months of the date
of this decision.
3. No investigation costs be paid by the
4. The evidence in any affidavit material be
Dated 24 September 2009.
