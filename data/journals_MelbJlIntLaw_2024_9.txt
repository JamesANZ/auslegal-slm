II SOUTH AFRICA’S
REQUESTS FOR PROVISIONAL MEASURES
During the first half of 2024, South Africa sought provisional measures from
the ICJ on four occasions. Part II examines those requests,
beginning with the
Order of 26 January
followed by the Court’s communication to the parties on 16 February
and the Orders of 28 March
and 24 May 2024.
South Africa’s
First Request: The Order of 26 January 2024

measures asked the ICJ to direct Israel to suspend the military
operation in

(a) Prima Facie Jurisdiction
The ICJ began with prima facie jurisdiction. It noted that both states were
Contracting Parties to the
Genocide Convention
and that jurisdiction was
based on art IX, a compromissory clause to which neither party had made any
reservation.
A related issue was

For the Court, this was evidence of ‘clearly opposite views’ between
the parties about whether Israel’s actions
in Gaza were in violation of
With respect to genocidal intent, the Court observed that it was not required at
the provisional measures stage to determine whether

(b) Plausibility and the Link Requirement
Since the 2009 decision in

, the ICJ has maintained that
provisional measures require the rights for which protection is sought to be
plausible’.
Africa’s argument on plausibility was twofold. First, South Africa argued
that Palestinians in Gaza constitute a protected
group under art II of the
Genocide Convention
and therefore have the right to protection from
genocide and its incitement; South Africa also referred to the plausibility of
own rights ‘to safeguard compliance with’ the
Convention.
Secondly, South
Africa referred to the plausibility of its

of genocide, including the killing of
Palestinians, the destruction of basic conditions of life and incendiary
statements by Israeli
For its part, Israel agreed that plausibility required the Court to consider
‘the possible breach of the rights claimed’
but argued that the
facts, including Israel’s efforts ‘to mitigate harm when conducting
operations and to alleviate hardship
and suffering’, negated any possible
inference of genocidal intent and, therefore, any plausible claim under the
Genocide Convention
The ICJ found that the “plausibility” requirement was met. First,
the Court determined that Palestinians appeared to be
a protected group within
the meaning of the
Genocide Convention
and that the two million
Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip were a ‘substantial part’ of
that group.
The Court also
referred to then-recent information indicating that 25,700 Palestinians in Gaza
had been killed in Israel’s
military operation since 7 October 2023, with
thousands more injured and as many as 1.7 million people internally displaced,
as evidence of an unfolding public health disaster and a rise in extreme
hunger and malnutrition.
Finally, the Court pointed to allegations of ‘dehumanizing language’
used by Israeli officials and quoted public statements
by the President and
Defence Minister of Israel to that
The Court concluded that
such facts and circumstances were sufficient to support a conclusion that
‘at least some of the rights
claimed by South Africa and for which it is
seeking protection are plausible’, and that at least some of the
provisional measures
sought, ‘by their very nature’, demonstrated
the requisite link to those
As discussed below, the
Court’s approach to plausibility — including whether this

(c) Urgency and Risk of Irreparable
The final requirement for the indication of provisional measures was an
imminent risk of irreparable prejudice to the rights at issue

Africa argued that Israel’s military campaign, including its severe impact
on the delivery of humanitarian
aid and basic services, posed an ongoing threat
to human life in Gaza.

aid no longer
South Africa
implored the ICJ not ‘to sit back and be silent’ but to exercise its
‘pivotal’ role in upholding
Israel contended
that its efforts to facilitate humanitarian aid, combined with a decrease in the
‘scope and intensity’
of the hostilities, negated any risk of
imminent irreparable harm.
The ICJ noted Israel’s position and evidence that Israel had recently
opened investigations into some instances of alleged incitement.
But the Court
placed greater weight on statements by the UN Secretary-General, including his
view that ‘[n]owhere is safe in
Gaza’ amidst ‘a severe risk of
collapse of the humanitarian system’ and ‘devastating levels of
destruction’.
The Court also referred to a 17 January 2024 statement by the
Commissioner-General of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine

discretion to decide how to address the Court’s concerns.
Among the three judges in the majority who wrote separately (Judges Bhandari,
Nolte, and Xue), Judge Nolte’s Declaration, which
expressed a considerable
degree of caution and anxiety, merits comment. Judge Nolte observed that the
events of 7 October 2023 and
Israel’s response had combined to create an
‘apocalyptic situation’ arising ‘from a very complicated
and historical context’ on which people ‘hold widely
He regretted that the parties had largely ‘talked past each other during
the oral proceedings’.
Judge Nolte also noted the ICJ’s limited jurisdiction, which did not cover
possible violations of IHL or extend to the actions
of Hamas; nor did South
Africa’s request require the Court to address the law of self-defence or
self-determination.
‘plausibility’ standard, Judge Nolte accepted Israel’s
position that assessing the ‘plausibility of
[the] mental element’
of genocide was ‘indispensable’ to deciding a request for
provisional
In his view, South Africa had not made a plausible case that Israel’s
military operation was necessarily being pursued with
genocidal intent,
especially given Israel’s official objectives (the destruction of Hamas
and the return of hostages) and its
efforts to evacuate civilians and facilitate
aid; these factors made ‘it at least plausible that [the] military
operation [was]
being conducted with genocidal
This appeared to
introduce a new concept of
relative plausibility
(ie, a requirement to
weigh the plausibility of an applicant’s claims against the plausibility
of a respondent’s
However, Judge Nolte considered that South Africa’s claims relating to
incitement to genocide by Israeli officials were at
least plausible, which
allowed him to vote with the
Judge Sebutinde and Judge ad hoc Barak (the judge appointed by Israel for the
case and a former President of the Supreme Court of
Israel) also wrote
separately.
As noted above, Judge Sebutinde was the only member of the ICJ to vote against
each measure. In a dissenting opinion, she characterised
the Israeli-Palestinian
dispute as ‘essentially and historically a
political or
territorial
’ dispute rather than ‘a legal one’ and
disparaged South Africa’s ‘pretextual invocation’ of the
Genocide Convention
as ‘a desperate bid to force a case into the
context of such a treaty’.
Judge Sebutinde appeared to reject the Court’s long-held position that a
conflict’s political character does not negate
the existence of a legal
Like Judge Nolte, Judge Sebutinde took the view that South Africa had failed to
demonstrate ‘even on a prima facie basis’
that Israel was acting
with genocidal

‘genocidal rhetoric’ had been taken ‘out

For reasons similar to those offered by Judges Nolte and Sebutinde, he found
that South Africa had completely failed to meet that

expressed concern that the proceedings would ‘dilute the concept of

However, unlike Judge Sebutinde, Judge ad hoc Barak did not vote against the
measures on the prevention and punishment of incitement
(which he hoped would
‘discourage damaging rhetoric’) and humanitarian aid (which he
supported out of his own ‘humanitarian
convictions’).
In sum, the Order of 26 January 2024 gave South Africa a mixed result. On the
one hand, the ruling established that the Palestinian
population of Gaza faced a
real and imminent risk of actions by Israel that might violate the

Within Israel and beyond, South Africa’s decision to bring
the case had
been disparaged as an affront and an

‘mass violence needs to resemble the Holocaust

Africa’s submission as ‘meritless,
counterproductive and completely

German government
The ICJ’s order revealed the fatuousness of such remarks, even as Prime
Minister Netanyahu described the decision as a ‘mark
of shame’ upon
Regardless of the eventual outcome on the merits, the Court’s decision
made clear that South Africa’s allegations were
neither frivolous nor
baseless. It also made clear enough that the Court viewed Israel’s
humanitarian efforts as inadequate
and in need of immediate correction.
More broadly, the Order of 26 January 2024 appeared to trigger the duty of
third states to prevent genocide under art 1 of the
Genocide Convention
That obligation, and a corresponding duty to act, ‘arise at the instant
that the State learns of . . . the existence of a
serious risk that genocide
committed’.
The ICJ’s finding of a real and imminent risk in Gaza of irreparable
prejudice to rights protected by the
Genocide Convention
put third states
on notice of that ‘serious

Court appeared to credit the idea that Israel could not be expected to stand

however, was whether the first three provisional measures

composition),
South Africa
asked the Court on 12 February 2024 to exercise its power under art 75(1) of the
Rules of Court
to indicate provisional measures
proprio motu
The immediate catalyst for the request was Prime Minister Netanyahu’s
announcement of plans to mount a ground invasion of Rafah
in the south of the
Gaza Strip, an area where approximately 1.4 million people were then
sheltering.
According to the
UN Secretary-General, a ground invasion of Rafah threatened to
‘exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian
nightmare with
untold regional
consequences’.
South Africa’s decision to ask the ICJ to act of its own accord (a
procedural tactic that may seem like a contradiction in terms)
appeared to be

A more doctrinal concern centred on a lack of clarity about what constitutes

On the surface,
this was a bold move by the Court. However, the measure’s wording left
unclear whether it covered only UN mechanisms
with express mandates to
investigate allegations of genocide, or whether any fact-finding body mandated
by a competent UN organ could
seek access to Gaza for the purpose of
investigating allegations of genocide. It was also unclear whether fact-finding
bodies established
by the UN Human Rights Council, a subsidiary body of the UN
General Assembly and not itself a UN organ, were covered by the Court’s
language, or whether UN special rapporteurs would qualify as
“investigative bodies” (the Court’s order clearly
extend to the ICC Prosecutor). The Independent International Commission of
Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory,
including East Jerusalem, and
Israel (‘Independent International Commission of Inquiry’),
established by the UN Human
Rights Council in 2021, asserted in a June 2024
report that ‘it is the UN-mandated investigative body’ to which the
Order applied,
although this raised the question as to why the Court did not identify it by
name. These ambiguities provided Israel with grounds
to challenge any future
requests for access from the most likely
candidates.
As a result, the
Court’s decision likely required either the Security Council or General
Assembly to establish a new investigative
body that would unambiguously fall
within the terms of the Court’s Order, but no immediate steps were taken
in this direction.
III EVALUATION
This initial phase in
South Africa v Israel
can be evaluated from two
perspectives: its short-term impact on the underlying conflict in Gaza and its
contribution to the ICJ’s
broader jurisprudence. The case underscores the
limitations of the judicial function (Part III(A)) while also highlighting areas
of uncertainty in the Court’s provisional measures practice (Part III(B)).
These include: (1) the Court’s “plausibility”
test, (2) the
threshold for modification of provisional measures and (3) treatment of
third-party evidence.
The Limits of the
Judicial Function
From a legal perspective, South Africa’s repeated recourse to the
provisional measures procedure got results. The ICJ’s
three successive
orders, which displayed considerable agreement among the judges, reflected a
clear trajectory; at each stage, the
measures became more direct, concrete and
intrusive. Yet for all of the attention paid to these proceedings and the great
stock placed
in the Court’s decisions,
South Africa v Israel
not translate into effective action at the political or military level.
Following the Court’s initial intervention in January,
the situation in
Gaza remained precarious and perilous. Bombs continued to fall, disease and
hunger proliferated, and hostages taken
on 7 October 2023 remained captive. In
the three months following the Court’s direction in May 2024 to halt the
offensive in
Rafah, Rafah was laid to
The defining feature
of the Court’s early interventions was not a triumph of international law,
but the unbearable lightness
of its provisional measures in the face of a

This state of affairs was not wholly surprising.

Nolte made a similar point: ‘The

noted above, in more exasperated terms: ‘[T]he Court is only a

Court’s high-profile decisions in
South Africa v Israel
generate the political will among Israel’s closest partners — most
notably, the US — to force Israel’s
hand (for example, by suspending
military assistance).
Court’s inherent limitations are magnified when powerful states choose not
to support the institution or insist on a strict
and artificial separation
between judicial and political means of dispute
settlement.
The focus placed
on the ICJ by South Africa (as evidenced by its decision to seek recourse from
the Court on four separate occasions
within the space of five months) also
served to highlight those

in Gaza could have been even worse in the absence of the ICJ’s
interventions. Provisional measures potentially contributed to some increase in
the delivery of humanitarian aid and basic services;

But whether a
post-January 2024 slowdown had anything to do with the Court is open to serious
question, and these considerations
did little to dispel the sense that the
response to the provisional measures fell short of the Court’s
objectives.
The ICJ’s orders also probably made some contribution to galvanising
widespread opposition to the Israeli government’s
response to the 7
October 2023 attacks. As noted above, the Court’s decisions —
especially the initial Order of 26 January
2024 — challenged those who
viewed the invocation of ‘genocide’ in Gaza as a ‘[m]oral

fact that parties
have made arguments about the plausibility of claims as well
For example, in
The Gambia v Myanmar
, both parties addressed the
plausibility of The Gambia’s claims under the
Genocide Convention
— not only the rights under threat — at the provisional measures
stage. The Gambia argued that ‘based on the evidence
and material placed
before the Court, the acts of which it complains are capable of being
characterized at least plausibly as
genocidal’.
part, Myanmar disputed the existence of any ‘plausible claim’ under
Genocide Convention
ICJ concluded that the rights invoked by The Gambia (namely, those of the
Rohingya group in Myanmar to be protected from acts
of genocide) were plausible.
However, it linked that conclusion, at least in part, to the evidence of grave
human rights violations
that The Gambia had put into evidence, as well as
Myanmar’s admission that its actions might have involved some violations
of international law.
suggested a conflation of rights and claims.
The ICJ’s plausibility analysis in
South Africa
recalled that approach. As noted above, the part of the Order of 26 January 2024
that addressed plausibility also reviewed evidence
submitted by South Africa in
support of the claim that Israel’s response to the events of 7 October
2023 amounted to genocide.
This included UN reports that documented the number
of deaths and injuries in Gaza, the ‘massive destruction’ of homes,
and the forcible displacement of ‘the vast majority of the
population’.
part of the Court’s decision referred to the ‘crisis levels of
hunger’ in Gaza, the devastating consequence
of the war for children in
Gaza, and a UN official’s description of Gaza as ‘a place of death
and despair’.

displays of genocidal intent.
None of this evidence was relevant to deciding whether the Palestinian
population of Gaza was a protected group with rights under

right to seek Israel’s compliance. To the contrary, this information
relevant to a different part of the test for provisional measures: the
requirement of an urgent risk of irreparable prejudice
to those rights. The
facts and circumstances described under the heading of plausibility might have
been more appropriately set out
in that section of the Order (and the Court did
further describe some of the evidence
But the Court
referred specifically to ‘facts and circumstances’ that related to
South Africa’s claims on the merits
when it determined that ‘at
least some of the rights claimed by South Africa and for which it is seeking
protection are
plausible’.
The ICJ’s decision to organise its plausibility analysis in this way
created the impression that it had also found that South
Africa’s central
claim on the merits — that is, that Israel was violating the

plausible’.
words of former ICJ President Donoghue, this reflected a “shorthand”
that misinterpreted what the Court had
actually decided. In an interview in
April 2024 (approximately two months after the end of her term on the Court),
she responded
as follows when asked whether the most important part of the
Court’s decision had been the finding that South Africa’s
claims were plausible:
The Court’s test ... uses the idea of plausibility, but the test is the
plausibility of the rights that are asserted by the
applicant, in this case
South Africa. So the Court decided that the Palestinians had a plausible right
to be protected from genocide
and that South Africa had the right to present
that claim in the Court. It then looked at the facts as well, but it did not
— and this is something where I’m correcting what’s
often said in the media — it did not decide that the
claim of genocide was
plausible. It did emphasise in the order that there was a risk of irreparable
harm to the Palestinian right
to be protected from genocide. But the shorthand
that often appears — which is that there is a plausible case of genocide
isn’t what the Court
This explanation adhered to the language of the ICJ’s Order,
notwithstanding how some of the evidence discussed by the Court
was presented.
Ultimately, the plausibility of the rights at issue in
South Africa v
should not have been a contentious point, if the distinction between
rights and claims is
But President Donoghue’s clarification was quickly misinterpreted in
two ways. First, some observers misunderstood her to mean
that the ICJ had
therefore determined that South Africa’s claims were
This was also plainly incorrect. The Court’s test simply did not require
it in any formal sense to assess the plausibility
of South Africa’s claims

did consider that South Africa’s claims in the main case were
“plausible”
— in an ordinary, non-technical sense of the word.
The existence of a real and imminent risk of irreparable prejudice will
turn, at least in part, on whether the party seeking provisional measures has
made credible allegations of past violations
and persuaded the Court of their
relevance to an assessment of risk going
The provisional measures phase of
South Africa
underscored the need for the ICJ to come to terms with the meaning of the
plausibility test — in part because not all members
of the Court shared
former President Donoghue’s view of a clear demarcation between the
plausibility of rights and the plausibility
of claims. Judge Bhandari, for
example, referred to the plausibility of rights in a declaration, but did so in
a way that conflated
rights under the
Genocide Convention
Africa’s claims.
Nolte also focused on the plausibility of South Africa’s claims, including
the idea that the plausibility of Israel’s
rebuttal arguments was also a
relevant factor.
Judge Sebutinde concluded that the rights asserted by South Africa were not
plausible because, in her view, South Africa
had failed to establish ‘that
the acts allegedly committed by Israel ... were committed with the necessary
genocidal intent’.
if framed in the language of rights, the substance of these objections turned on
the strength of South Africa’s claims
relating to the alleged violations
of those rights.
The ICJ has a choice. It should either make clear that the plausibility
requirement is strictly limited to ascertaining whether the
rights invoked by a
party are plausible (a determination that in some cases will be obvious) or it
should embrace the idea that a
party seeking provisional measures needs to
establish the plausibility of its claims on the merits. In the latter scenario,
would need to clarify whether this means demonstrating only that a
party’s claims are not manifestly unfounded or whether a
more demanding
standard would
These different views of the plausibility requirement correspond to different
ideas of the judicial function. An approach focused
on the plausibility of
rights allows the Court to exercise a more interventionist role in situations of
crisis, even at the risk
of sometimes acting to protect rights with respect to
claims that may prove unfounded. By contrast, an approach focused on the
plausibility
of claims envisages a more circumscribed judicial body that is

South Africa was inviting the Court to revisit its then very recent decision not

offensive in Rafah remained speculative and that the broadly
worded measures
from January remained adequate. When the Court acceded to South Africa’s
requests for modified provisional

judges wrestled with the meaning of a “change in the situation”.

the Court’s decisions raised questions about whether

This points to the difficulty with the concerns expressed by some judges in
South Africa v Israel
. Adjudicating a party’s noncompliance with
provisional measures at the merits phase creates the opportunity to address the
legal consequences resulting from the breach of an international obligation.
This is distinct from considering whether a party’s

In sum, deciding whether to modify an order on provisional measures may
involve an assessment of compliance with the measures already
in place, but this
is distinct from deciding that a party’s international responsibility has
been engaged based on noncompliance.
Moreover, the ICJ’s grounds for
deciding that a modification is justified by “some change in the
situation” is
necessarily without prejudice to the ultimate question of
responsibility for an alleged breach of the Court’s order. The debate
South Africa v Israel
conflict obscured a broader point about the judicial function. If it comes to
the attention
of the Court that its provisional measures are not effectively
protecting the rights at issue from irreparable harm, the Court has
authority to address these shortcomings through modification. The argument that
the Court cannot take a view on compliance with
provisional measures until the
judgment on the merits runs counter to the fundamental purpose of interim

South Africa v Israel
also resurrected
questions relating to the evidentiary basis for ICJ findings. As set out above,

Affairs, the World
Health Organization, UNRWA, the United Nations’
Children’s Fund, and the World Food

‘heavy reliance’ on UN reports
‘when these cannot be said to
constitute sufficient evidence of a reliable quality’ or ‘have been
prepared without
access to relevant and necessary information, including that
held by Israel, and often without any attempt to access such
information’.
Israel further argued that many UN reports relied on ‘Hamas sources or on
those subject to Hamas intimidation’ and that

explain its approach to third-party evidence, including
reports by UN bodies,
non-governmental organisations and
journalists.
Among other
factors, the Court has suggested a preference for evidence generated through an
adversarial, court-like process —
where factual assertions can be tested
by cross-examination — over evidence gathered through on-the-spot
investigations, interviews
In practice, however,
the Court has shown a considerable willingness to credit facts established by
investigatory bodies that have
not involved a court-like process, at least when
such reports are generated by UN-established
mechanisms.
In particular,

independent actors and based on multiple sources,
such reports are more likely
to be credible and entitled to weight, at least to the extent that their

to take a more forgiving approach to
third-party evidence when faced with allegations involving a grave risk to human
life, sometimes

evidence at the provisional measures stage reflects a variant of
precautionary principle, such that the Court will act proactively to extend

have explained why it viewed reports based

concerning information provided justifiable reasons for the

treatment of the evidence before it in the

an inference of genocidal intent) or in its inescapable sense (such that the

It would also correct for the fact that the more restrictive
understanding of the “only reasonable inference” makes it
impossible to establish genocidal intent in a situation of armed
Notably, the situation in Gaza also differs in some respects from other

cases that the Court has faced. The extent of the
humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and Israel’s alleged role in creating and
perpetuating
those conditions, will be a key aspect of South Africa’s
case. The Court will be asked to decide whether Israel’s “total
siege” approach to the conflict amounted to ‘[d]eliberately
inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to
bring about its
physical destruction in whole or in
In this respect,
evidence of famine conditions and forced starvation, and the extent to which
those conditions resulted from Israeli
policy choices, will loom large.
Similarly, South Africa can be expected to use the evidence of the repeated
displacement of people
from their homes, as well as attacks against hospitals
and essential civilian infrastructure, to support the proposition that Israel
has sought to make the territory uninhabitable as part of a broader plan or
policy to destroy the Palestinian population of Gaza.

to emphasise that its efforts to increase the flow of humanitarian aid or to

All of this points to the promise and perils of litigating human rights
through interstate adjudication. At one level,
South Africa v Israel
reflects a continuing faith in the power of international law, as administered
by international courts, to respond to injustice.
At another level, the
“unbearable lightness” of the ICJ’s provisional measures has
been enough to test the faith
of any true believer. It is also surely the case
that South Africa has chosen to litigate the conflict in Gaza as a question of

better alternatives. This highlights the restricted jurisdictional
environment
in which the ICJ operates, which is an important factor in making sense of how
the Court has responded to South Africa’s
requests. The Court has

genocide between South Africa and Israel, but not to entertain other legal

For the reasons sketched out above, it is entirely possible that the ICJ will
ultimately find that the immense human suffering in
Gaza represents a profound
tragedy, but not a genocide. More than a year after the attacks on 7 October
2023, that outcome may be
somewhat less likely than when South Africa instituted
the proceedings at the end of 2023. But a determination that Israel’s
actions in Gaza amount to genocide will likely require a new approach to the

on the part of the Court — an approach that
revisits how the high standard of genocidal intent can be met and the

No matter the

a measure of justice to those who have suffered. It will,
however, very likely say a great deal about the practical relevance of

by former ICJ President Joan Donoghue, after she had left the Court, also

In accordance with the

Judges Gómez Robledo (Mexico), Cleveland (US), Aurescu (Romania) and

President, with Judge Sebutinde (Uganda) assuming the
role of Vice-President.

This refers to the
argument that international courts and tribunals should refrain from deciding
legal questions that pertain to
a dispute subject to a diplomatic process
— a viewpoint that marginalises the relevance of rights and obligations
by law to establishing the just terms of a negotiated peace. See, eg,
the US argument in the advisory proceedings on Israeli practices
in the Occupied
Palestinian Territory that the Court should ‘avoid impinging on the very
subject matter of the underlying dispute’
because this ‘could
contravene and significantly risk supplanting the established framework’
for negotiations: ‘Written

It would be naïve
to suggest that South Africa assumed that Israel would simply comply with any

Equatorial Guinea v
Provisional Measures

‘factual plausibility’ to describe a test by which the Court must
satisfy itself
that evidence demonstrates a plausible violation of the rights at
issue: see Massimo Lando, ‘Plausibility in the Provisional

(2018) 31(3)

For an overview of
commentary that referred to the Court’s decision in this way, see Roy
Schondorf, ‘Implausible Confusion:
The Meaning of
“Plausibility” in the ICJ’s Provisional Measures’,

>. Schondorf
also suggests that the threshold to establish plausibility is so low (at least
in the minds of some ICJ judges) that
‘almost any armed conflict could be
the basis for provisional measures by the Court’. This does not properly
acknowledge
that the party seeking provisional measures must also establish a
real and imminent risk of irreparable harm to the rights at issue
in the main
case; the existence of plausible rights is a necessary but not sufficient
00:05:05–00:05:55.
The rationale for
assessing the plausibility of rights makes more sense in cases involving a novel
theory of treaty rights or an
untested proposition relating to customary
international law or general principles (for example, Timor-Leste’s claim
to a ‘right to the confidentiality of communications ... between
legal counsel and client’ in its request for provisional
measures in the
Seizure and Detention of Certain Documents
Seizure and Detention of Certain Documents and Data (Timor-Leste v Australia)
(Provisional Measures)
[2014] ICJ Rep 147, 152 [24]. The plausibility test
adds little when the existence of the rights at issue is beyond dispute. Judge
Cançado Trindade lamented the fact that the Court’s approach had
led it to describe fundamental rights in several cases
as merely plausible:
The Gambia v Myanmar
(Provisional Measures
) 58–61 [75]–[80] (Judge
Cançado Trindade).
For example, in the
pending case against Syria relating to allegations of torture, the Court
addressed the plausibility of the applicants’
rights in three short
paragraphs and then focused on evidence of alleged past violations when
assessing the risk of irreparable prejudice
to those rights going forward:
Application of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Canada and the Netherlands
v Syrian Arab
Republic) (Provisional Measures)

List No 188, Order of 16 November 2023) 15–16 [56]–[58], 18–20

South Africa v

analysis did not distinguish clearly between the requirements of prima facie
and plausibility of rights.
Divisions within the
Court also appeared in the Court’s decision in
Nicaragua v Germany
(Provisional Measures)
. For example, Judge Iwasawa asserted that
plausibility goes to whether the rights invoked by a party exist, while evidence
to the alleged violations of those rights goes to the risk of
irreparable prejudice:
Nicaragua v Germany (Provisional Measures
) [18]–[20] (Judge Iwasawa). By
contrast, Judge Tladi asserted that plausibility relates to whether a party has
prospect of success on the merits’ and
requires the Court to consider whether it is plausible that the rights invoked
been infringed’: at [8] (Judge Tladi) (emphasis in

in place do not address the new circumstances: see ibid [15]

that states

[2009] ICJ Rep 213, 267 [150].
When information before the Court suggests noncompliance, or a good faith
disagreement about what compliance
requires, this could be understood as an
unforeseen situation that allows for modification (although only if better
tailored or more
specific measures have some chance of better protecting the
rights at risk).

Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Cuba,
Ireland, Libya, the Maldives, Mexico, Spain and
Türkiye had submitted declarations of non-party intervention under art 63
ICJ Statute

art 62 to intervene as a party. Palestine submitted an application to intervene
under art 62 and a declaration of intervention under art 63. These materials are

Contracting Party to the
Genocide Convention
is entitled to intervene as
a non-party under art 63 of the
ICJ Statute
; under art 62, the Court can
decide upon any request to intervene (whether as a party or non-party) when a
state considers that it
has ‘an interest of a legal nature which may be
affected by the decision in the case’. Setting aside questions relating
Palestine’s status as a party to the
ICJ Statute
, Palestine would
likely have little difficulty establishing such an interest. By contrast,
Nicaragua’s application raised a
novel question by asking whether the
interest of every treaty party in the construction of a multilateral convention
(the interest
protected by the right of intervention in art 63) also constitutes
an ‘interest of a legal nature’ for purposes of art
62 intervention.

Africa’s claims relating to the obligation to prevent and punish
incitement to genocide under arts III and IV of
Genocide Convention
may face fewer legal hurdles.

Ireland makes this
point in its declaration of intervention in
South Africa
That the pattern of conduct could only point to the existence of such
intent is not to say that it could point to such intent only
. . . [I]t is
perfectly possible that a pattern of conduct, upon examination, could point to
two separate intentions, only one of
which is genocidal.

Statute of the International Court of Justice’,

further motives — personal, political, or linked to military

otherwise established’: ‘Declaration

The idea of a state
plan or policy serves as a proxy for genocidal intent when a claim relates to
state responsibility under the
Genocide Convention
rather than individual
criminal liability: see William Schabas,

Politics, and Rights at the War Crimes Tribunals

Israel made such
arguments during the successive provisional measures proceedings, beginning in
January: see ‘Verbatim Record
) 46–9, 50–2. As Israel put
it in response to South Africa’s request for additional provisional
measures in March
2024, South Africa will be unable to reconcile the evidence of
Israel’s humanitarian initiatives with genocidal intent:
Put differently, which State that is engaged in genocide, or is indifferent
to the commission of acts within the scope of Article
II of the Convention,
works to coordinate humanitarian convoys and airdrops, or facilitates constantly
the provision of medical supplies
to hospitals, the establishment of field
hospitals, and the repair of critical infrastructure damaged in the course of
hostilities?

described Israel’s actions is a matter for the Court to decide.

argument at several points in challenging South Africa’s provisional

The authors’ broader point is that Israel’s outlier positions are
matched by the tendency of other states to also adopt
self-serving
interpretations of IHL and by the international community’s general
tendency ‘to apply new legal interpretations
uniquely to Israel’
even when these interpretations also deviate from mainstream views.
On these issues,
including the challenges in IHL posed by intent and purpose requirements, see

question in the case may be whether a pattern of reckless targeting of civilian

to their intentional targeting) not only
violates IHL but can also be interpreted as evidence of a plan or policy of

disproportionately affect
children imply genocidal intent by seeking to
eliminate future threats. See Moses (n
) 34–5, arguing that a mindset of
permanent security, which Moses describes as an ‘alternative category to
name and explain
the criminality that the genocide concept only partially
captures’, evinces a particular concern ‘not only with eliminating
immediate threats but also with future threats’.

submission in

action against armed
attackers’ could not be equated with ‘the intention of destroying an
