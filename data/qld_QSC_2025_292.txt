Lawyers for the defendant
Introduction
defendant succeeded in an action against the plaintiff. On 13 October 2021,
Dalton J ordered that the plaintiff pay the defendant’s
costs on the
District Court scale to be assessed. On 4 November 2022, the defendant served a
cost statement claiming $1,232,085.22
total costs, of which $857,324.12 were
professional costs claimed by the defendant’s New South Wales
plaintiff took objection to the lawyers charging New South Wales rates rather
than on the scale of costs in Schedule 1 to
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules
[3] On 20 March
2025, a costs assessor referred the following question to the court pursuant to
r 717 of the UCPR:
“On a proper assessment of the costs order
[made by Dalton J] how should the defendant’s costs be
[4] For the
reasons which follow, I have determined that the costs should be assessed on the
basis of schedule 1 to the UCPR.
[5] On 13 March
2017, the plaintiff commenced proceedings against the defendant in the District
Court of Queensland. On 24 April 2017,
the defendant filed a defence and counter
claim. Plastiras Lawyers acted for the defendant as Town Agents for Yates Beaggi
), a firm based in Sydney New South Wales. Plastiras
continued to act as Town Agent until 26 March 2020. On 1 October 2020, Boss
then acted as Town Agent for YBL.
following is not in dispute:
(a) At all material times YBL remained on the record for the defendant until 23
April 2024;
(b) At all material times YBL was a law practice located in Sydney, New South
(c) The individual practitioners having conduct of the matter on behalf of the
defendant were Australian legal practitioners holding
practising certificates
issued in New South Wales; and
(d) As Australian legal practitioners, they are entitled to practice in
Queensland by reason of
Legal Profession Act
[7] The matter
was tried in the Supreme Court before Dalton J in May 2021. Her Honour gave
judgment for the defendant on 2 September
On 13 October 2021,
Dalton J ordered:
“Order that the plaintiff pay the
defendant’s costs of the claim and of the defendant’s counter claim
against the
plaintiff on the District Court scale on a standard basis to be
assessed or agreed.”
November 2022, the defendant served a costs statement on the plaintiff. The
total costs claimed by the defendant are $1,232,085.22
of which $857,324.12 are
the professional costs claimed in respect of the work performed by YBL. The
claim by the defendant in respect
of his liability to YBL is calculated on the
basis of time costing rates applicable to work done by New South Wales
solicitors.
[9] On 9 January
2023, the plaintiff served its notice of objections to the cost statement. By
its notice of objections, the plaintiff
took objection to the defendant seeking
to claim his indemnity by reference to fees ordinarily charged for such work in
Wales rather than the scale of costs contained in Schedule 1 of
[10] On 11 June
2024, Mr Graham Robinson was appointed as Cost Assessor. On 20 March 2025, the
Cost Assessor filed his referral in
the Supreme Court.
[11] As can be
seen, the issue between the parties is that the plaintiff claims that the fees
charged by YBL should be on the scale
of costs contained in Schedule 1 of the
UCPR. The defendant on the other hand submits that YBL in entitled to charge its
rates applicable to work done by New South Wales solicitors.
Plaintiff’s submissions
plaintiff submits that the order of Dalton J is clear. Her order was that the
plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs on
the District Court scale. It is
submitted that rr 680 and 687 UCPR override r 724 UCPR. It is submitted that the
professional fees
of YBL are to be assessed according to the District Court
scale. This interpretation is consistent with r 691 UCPR and avoids the
absurdity that would arise if a party were to engage solicitors in another
more for the
work than a party engaging a Queensland solicitor.
further submitted there is a clear ambiguity between r 724 and r 691 UCPR. It is
submitted that r 5 UCPR is relevant to
the interpretation. It is not disputed
that YBL is entitled to charge the defendant in terms of their retainer, but the
costs ought
to be recovered should be in accordance with the order.
[14] In New
South Wales there is no applicable scale by reference to which party and party
costs are assessed. Party and party costs
in New South Wales are, in a sense,
unregulated and more closely equate to indemnity costs in Queensland. It would
be absurd for
a party instructing a lawyer outside of Queensland to be entitled
to greater indemnity than for a litigant who instructs lawyer practicing
Queensland. The UCPR should be construed so as to avoid an absurd result.
Ultimately, the plaintiff contends that on a proper
construction of the cost
order, the defendant’s costs (including the professional fees of the New
South Wales solicitors) should
be assessed in accordance with the scale of costs
in force when the costs were incurred in Queensland as provided for in the UCPR.
Defendant’s Submissions
defendant submits that the order made by Dalton J is consistent with the
operation of r 691(1) UCPR. The defendant notes
the plaintiff’s contention
that r 724(4) should be read subject to r 691(1) UCPR, such that the latter
imposes a maximum limit
on costs that can be assessed in favour of the
defendant. It is submitted this is not correct.
defendant submits that Chapter 17A of the UCPR governs the ordering and
assessment of costs. The chapter was incorporated
into the UCPR by amendments
made in 2007 with effect from 10 December
Chapter 17A relates to “costs of a proceeding” whereas
relates to “assessment of costs” i.e. party/party costs. It is
submitted there is a clear structure as to costs.
concerns the basis on
which the power is exercised and
concerns how costs are to be
assessed once the power is exercised. It is submitted the provisions clearly
complement each other and
work together, not in opposition to each other.
submitted that the order by Dalton J was that costs were to be on the standard
basis as agreed or assessed. It contemplated
that costs would be assessed in
accordance with Chapter 17A.
submitted that Chapter 17A was incorporated into the UCPR at a time when the
Legal Profession Act
(Qld) was passed to facilitate the national
practice of law by ensuring the Australian legal practitioners can engage in
legal practice
in Queensland.
new reality after that time was that non-Queensland lawyers were entitled to
practice in Queensland.
submitted that r 724(4) UCPR provided an important change which permitted that
lawyers practicing outside of Queensland
could recover their costs at the amount
applicable in the place where the lawyer practices. The fact is, YBL are lawyers
in New South Wales and their rates had been set according to New
South Wales market practices. Their costs have been included in
the statement of
costs as a disbursement.
submitted it is mandatory for Mr Robinson under r 724(4) UCPR to assess the
costs at the rate appropriate to New South
submitted that it is not absurd to construe r 691 UCPR as subject to r 724(4)
UCPR. For example, another state may have
lower rates than Queensland and there
might be a windfall for a lawyer practising outside of Queensland.
Rule 724(4)
UCPR is cognisant of the economic difference between States which is relevant to
national legal practice. It is wrong to imply words
into a regulatory
instrument.
implication proposed by the plaintiff is neither simple nor grammatical nor
consistent with an apparent statutory purpose.
Authorities relied on by the
plaintiff do not support its position.
submitted that the question should be answered:
defendant’s costs should be assessed in compliance with the provisions of
chapter 17A
of the UCPR and to the extent such costs relate to a lawyer
practising in New South Wales, the assessor must, pursuant to UCPR 724(4)
such costs having regard to the rate of costs commonly charged in that
Statutory regime
Civil Proceedings Act
(Qld) provides:
court may award costs in all proceedings unless otherwise provided.”
[27] There is
nothing in the
Civil Proceedings Act
which specifies the basis on which
costs may be awarded or once awarded, how they are to be assessed.
Supreme Court of Queensland Act 1991
(Qld) which provides that the
Governor in Council has the rule making power. Clause 21 of schedule 1 provides
that the rules may provide
as to costs in civil proceedings.
[29] Rule 681
UCPR provides:
General rule about
(1) Costs of a proceeding, including an application in a proceeding, are in
the discretion of the court but follow the event, unless
the court orders
(2) Subrule (1) applies unless these rules provide otherwise.”
[30] Rule 687
UCPR provides:
687 Assessed costs to be paid unless
court orders otherwise
(1) If, under these rules or an order of the court, a party is entitled to
costs, the costs are to be assessed costs.
(2) However, instead of assessed costs, the court may order a party to pay to
another party—
(a) a specified part or percentage of assessed costs; or
(b) assessed costs to or from a specified stage of the proceeding; or
(c) an amount for costs fixed by the court; or
(d) an amount for costs to be decided in the way the court directs.
[31] Rule 691
UCPR provides:
Australian lawyer’s
(1) For assessing costs on the standard basis, an Australian lawyer is
entitled to charge and be allowed the costs under the
scales of costs for work
done for or in a proceeding in the court.
(2) The scales of costs are in—
(a) for the Supreme Court and District Court—
(b) for Magistrates Courts—
(3) For an assessment for Magistrates Courts on the standard basis, the scale
appropriate

(4) For an assessment for Magistrates Courts on the indemnity basis, the
appropriate
for the amount the plaintiff claims applies.
(5) If the nature and importance, or the difficulty or urgency, of a
proceeding and the justice of the case justify it, the court
may allow an
increase of not more than 30% of the Australian lawyer’s costs allowable
on an assessment under the relevant scale
(6) A costs assessor has the same authority as the court under
subrule (5).
(7) The costs under the scales of costs for work done are inclusive of any
GST payable in relation to the work.
(8) Unless the court otherwise orders, the costs are in accordance with the
scale of costs in force when the costs were incurred.”
the UCPR deals with the assessment of costs. This provides for the provision of
a cost statement under r 706; objections to cost
statements under r 706; the
appointment of cost assessors and the procedure on assessments.
[33] Rule 724
UCPR provides:
Professional charges and
disbursements
(1) If a costs statement includes a charge for work done by a lawyer
practising in Queensland and acting as agent for a party’s
lawyer, the
charge must be shown as a professional charge, not as a disbursement.
(2) A costs assessor may assess and allow a charge mentioned in
subrule (1) even if it is not paid before the assessment.
(3) If a costs statement includes a charge for work done by a lawyer
practising outside Queensland, the charge may be shown as a disbursement
professional charge.
(4) If a costs assessor allows a charge mentioned in subrule (3) when
assessing costs, the amount the costs assessor allows must,
practicable, be an amount appropriate in the place where the lawyer
practises.”
defendant’s submissions that r 724 of the UCPR was inserted to ensure a
consistent approach nationally on, inter alia,
the question of costs, appears
[35] However,
this case comes down to an interpretation of the order made by Dalton J.
[36] It has been
said that in interpreting a court order, it must stand or fall on its own
However, on occasions a
court must have regard to extrinsic evidence to interpret the order, such as
reasons for judgment
[37] In the
costs decision in
Tulloch Brae Pty Ltd v Environmental Protection equipment
Pty Ltd (No2)
decided that indemnity costs were not appropriate despite submissions by the
defendants that they should be awarded. Her
Honour also specifically awarded
costs on the District Court scale. It can readily be concluded this was because
the amounts were
within the jurisdiction of the District Court.
[38] In this
particular case, the determination to award costs on the District Court scale
was an order not only as to costs but also
an order as to the way in which costs
were to be assessed. In this particular case, her Honour’s order made it
clear that the
defendant’s costs were to be
the District Court
scale (in schedule 1) on the standard basis to be assessed.
[39] The Court
made a specific order as to the way in which costs were to be assessed under r
681(1) UCPR or alternatively under r
687(2)(d) UCPR.
plaintiff’s submission is correct that her Honour’s order overrode
any of the provisions of r 724 UCPR because
her Honour made an order governing
the way the costs were to be assessed. The fees of YBL are part of the
defendant’s costs.
[41] Such an
approach is also consistent with the provisions of r 691 UCPR where the
assessment of costs by an Australian lawyer is
referred to as the scale of costs
for the District Court. Indeed this approach is consistent with the approach
taken by Jones J in
Theden v Nominal
[42] There is no
doubt that YBL are entitled to charge their client in accordance with the terms
of their retainer, but what is in
issue here is the costs payable by the losing
party under a court order. It is to be noted that an award of costs is not
to provide comprehensive compensation for any loss suffered by a
[43] Cannon
Street Pty Limited v Karedis
may be distinguished. There was no similar limitation in the costs order in that
[44] Maggbury
Pty Ltd v Hafele Australia Pty
may also be
distinguished. In that case, the order was that the plaintiffs pay the second
defendant’s costs to be assessed without
any other limitation.
[45] For the
reasons given, I answer the question asked by the costs assessor as follows:
“On a proper construction of the costs order made by Dalton J
on 13 October 2021 the defendant’s costs (including the
professional fees
of the New South Wales solicitors) should be assessed in accordance with the
Queensland District Court scale of
costs in force when the costs were
