of the Act. The former must yield whenever the court
finds in a particular case that there are circumstances justifying the making
an order for costs.
Section 237(2)
requires a finding of justifying
circumstances as an essential preliminary to the making of an order. Beyond this
there is nothing
in the subject matter or in the interrelationship of the two
provisions which imposes any additional or special onus on an applicant
order for costs.
It has been recognised that, while costs do not 'follow the event' any more on
an appeal than they do in any other proceedings under
the Act, a party being
wholly unsuccessful in an appeal, which by definition seeks to deny the other
party the 'fruits of their judgment',
can be of great significance. However,
that consideration applies where an appellant unsuccessfully challenges orders
made in favour
of the other party on appeal, rather than where the appeal is
successful.

denied the 'fruits of their judgment', is a reference

have taken into account all of the matters in
, to the extent that
the evidence enables the Court to do so. Four particular matters under
were identified and addressed by the parties in submissions as
being relevant in the present case:
s 237(3)(a)
, which concerns the financial circumstances of each of the
parties to the proceedings;
s 237(3)(c)
, which concerns the conduct of the parties to the
proceedings in relation to the proceedings;
s 237(3)(e)
, which concerns whether any party to the proceedings has
been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings; and
s 237(3)(g)
, which concerns any other matters as the court considers
I will deal with each of those
matters in turn.
deal, first, with the matter in
s 237(3)(e)
, that any party has been wholly
unsuccessful in the proceedings.
is the case that the appellant was wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings,
inasmuch as the appeal has been dismissed, albeit that
a preliminary issue dealt
with by the Court in relation to the jurisdiction of the appeal established that
the appeal was properly
commenced by the appellant and within jurisdiction.
Beyond that, I accept that the appellant was wholly unsuccessful. That is a
which can be of great significance, but it will not necessarily be
determinative in every case.
would observe that the expression 'the fruits of a judgment' referred to in
AK v V [No 2]
far more apt in cases concerning financial matters, in relation to which the
incurring of costs may well deplete the fruits of
a financial judgment that was
obtained at first instance. In the present case, the proceedings concerned the
parent who was to have
the primary care of their five‑year‑old
child, and other parenting orders made by the Family Court.
those circumstances, to refer to the fruits of the judgment is probably
inapposite. These proceedings concerned a matter of significant
importance to
each of the parties in relation to the future care and welfare of their son. It
is not a matter which is ultimately
able to be in any way valued in financial
to the other matters, the next matter is the financial circumstances of each of
the parties to the proceedings
(s 237(3)(a)).
was no additional evidence put before the Court in relation to the current
financial situation of the parties, although, in
submissions, counsel for the
respondent accepted that in a general sense, the financial position of the
respondent is better or superior
to that of the appellant. Indeed, counsel for
the respondent asked the Court to take into account that there were remaining
proceedings
in the Family Court of Western Australia in relation to which the
appellant is unrepresented and the respondent is represented by
senior counsel,
junior counsel, and a firm of solicitors. That fact alone, which is not
contested, is enough to indicate that the
Court can properly infer that the
respondent's financial resources are superior to that of the appellant.
third matter raised in the submissions is the 'conduct of the parties to the
proceedings in relation to the proceedings'
(s 237(3)(c)).
that respect, the respondent raised the fact that there was an amendment of the
appellant's case in the appeal. Those amendments
confined the grounds of appeal
and brought more clarity and structure to the grounds of appeal generally. As
the respondent's counsel
accepted, the amendments did not fundamentally alter
the appeal. While the change to the appellant's solicitors and counsel, leading
to the substituted appellant's case, was something that would have incurred some
additional costs, it was ultimately productive of
the efficient hearing of the
appeal. In that regard, while it was unsuccessful, the appeal itself was
conducted responsibly, clearly
and concisely by counsel for the appellant.
my view, there is nothing in relation to the conduct of the appeal itself to
suggest that costs ought to be visited on the appellant
by reason of the conduct
of the parties.
relation to the proceedings themselves, while they were described as complex
(including reference to there having been a trial
over 10 days), I would not
characterise the appeal as complex. The appeal ultimately turned on findings of
fact and the exercise
of discretion. It did not involve any new principle. It
involved the application of well-established principles established by the
Court in cases such as
House v The
Bondelmonte v
Bondelmonte
the circumstances, the proceedings did not, in my view, raise particular factual
or legal complexity to take it out of the ordinary.
relation to the other matters that the Court considers relevant
(s 237(3)(g))
, the respondent submitted that costs were not a punishment
but were a reimbursement. I accept that to be a relevant principle.
the same time, there are proceedings which are ongoing between the parties. The
proceedings involve their son. That requires the
parties to continue to
cooperate in the future. It is in the best interests of their son that
disputation between the parties, particularly
in relation to financial matters,
is kept at a minimum. That can only be for the benefit of their son. In my
view, that is a matter
which is relevant to the exercise of the discretion.
relation to the financial position of the parties, Senior Counsel for the
respondent also referred to the decision of the High
Court of Australia in
Northern Territory v
was a case in which the Court held that in relation to the general discretion in
relation to costs in a defamation case, the
impecuniosity of an unsuccessful
party was not a consideration that without more may justify a decision to deny
the successful party
its costs. So much may be accepted. In the present case, of
course, the Court is not dealing with the general discretion as to costs,
the discretions identified in
application of
, rather than the general law, has two consequences.
The first is the general position in
that each party bear their
own costs, and secondly, one of the considerations identified, as a mandatory
consideration, is in fact
the financial circumstances of each of the parties to
the proceedings. The financial circumstances will therefore be relevant, and
is a matter tending against the application for costs by the respondent in the
present case, that on the position that can be
inferred from the circumstances,
the appellant is in a worse financial position than the respondent.
all of the circumstances, in my view, having regard to the respondent's superior
financial position; to the proper and efficient
conduct of the appeal; to the
fact that the appeal was arguable, albeit wholly unsuccessful; and to the need
for the parties to cooperate
in future for the benefit of their son, the proper
exercise of the discretion is to order that each party to the proceedings bear
their own costs, pursuant to the general rule in
that reason, I would make the following
appeal be dismissed; and

pronounced. I would add that in my view, there is wisdom
in the way in which the
legislation has addressed the question of costs by providing specifically for
this to be a jurisdiction where
the presumption is that parties will bear their
own costs, unless the elements of the discretion are engaged under

has mentioned, it is important that the parties continue to have ongoing

has enumerated. So, for that additional reason,
I join particularly in what

having regard to the
considerations in
