SOLICITORS:
Preston Law for the first respondent
[1] On 22 March 2010, this Court handed down its decision dismissing an appeal
by Anson Holdings Pty Ltd (the appellant) against
a decision of the Land Court
that the appellant should pay 40% of the first respondent’s costs of
proceedings before the Land
Court. Those proceedings concerned an application
by the first respondent, Ian Earl Wallace, for a mining lease, an associated
environmental authority (Mining Lease) and draft environmental
Court ordered the appellant to pay the first respondent’s costs of and
incidental to the appeal unless the appellant
contended, within a specified
time, that other orders ought to be made.
[2] The appellant has submitted that there should be no order as to the costs of
the appeal because -
raised issues of considerable significance to landowners and others affected by
or concerned about mining lease applications.
In particular -
- the appeal
decision clearly established that with the transfer of jurisdiction concerning
mining lease applications from the Land
and Resources Tribunal to the Land Court
in September 2007 the rule that “parties bear their own costs” ended
are now in the discretion of the Land Court. Prior to the decision of
the Land Appeal Court there was uncertainty and it was therefore
unreasonable for the appellant to seek clarification by way of the appeal.
- the appeal
decision confirmed that grounds of objection based on formal defects may be
judged as trivial and potentially expose
the objector to cost orders unless it
is shown they have resulted in prejudice.
The Land Court
and the Land Appeal Court have a longstanding approach recognizing the
desirability of maintaining easy access to the
Land Court in revenue appeals.
This has been extended to water licences –
Dawson v Chief Executive,
Department of Natural Resources and
approach should be extended to mining applications because the grant of a mining
lease can be at least as significant to a
landowner’s property and rights
as a water licence decision. On the basis of such an approach, the parties
should bear their
[3] The first respondent submitted that an order for costs in favour of the
appellant was appropriate for the following reasons –
The appeal was
wholly unsuccessful;
appellant’s grounds of appeal were demonstrated to be unmeritorious;
respondent had incurred significant costs in responding to the appeal including
briefing counsel.
Section 34(1)
Land Court Act 2000
(the Act) provides, so far
as is relevant, that
Subject to the provisions of this or another Act to the contrary,
the Land Court may order costs for a proceeding in the court as
it considers
appropriate.
If the court does not make an order under subsection (1), each
party to the proceeding must bear the party's own costs for the proceeding.
Section 72(1)
provides that
applies, with necessary changes, to the Land
Appeal Court.
[5] It has been held on many occasions that the discretion given to the Land
of the Act is complete and that the discretion is not to be
fettered by any preconceived rules or principles other than that the
is to be exercised
judicially.
[6] There are decisions of the Land Court where the Court rejected an
application for costs in water licence appeals under the
Water Resources Act
, saying that it was desirable that access should be available to
appellants under the
Water Resources Act
without fear of costs being
awarded to either party except in special
licence cases were decided by analogy with a line of authority dealing with
revenue cases in the Land Court. For example,
Bowden v The
Valuer-General
the Land Appeal Court said that, in exercising the discretion under s.34,
one relevant consideration to be taken into account is ease
of access to the
reviewing tribunal -
" Easy access to the Land Court to air
grievances and have valuations reviewed is, as we have already stressed, most
desirable in
revenue cases, and such access should be available without fear of
costs being awarded to either party except in special cases."
[7] The authorities concerning the desirability of maintaining easy access to
the Court in revenue cases were considered more recently
by the Land Appeal
PT Limited and Westfield Management Limited v The Department of
Natural Resources
Appeal Court emphasised that where the Land Court is given a discretion to
order the payment of costs, it should not
be bound by any presumptive rule or
principle, although the Court was not precluded from resorting to settled
discretion is complete but must be exercised judicially. The Court recognized
that there may be any number of factors which
a court vested with general
the litigation; another
might be the overall purpose of the
legislation.
Court said that it is entirely in accordance with the proper exercise of the
discretion to award costs to give effect to the
matters expressed in
, but those observations should not be read as imposing a gloss on
the legislation mandating when the discretion ought be exercised
Ordinarily costs are not awarded to punish the unsuccessful parties. Costs are
intended to compensate the successful party against
the expense which he or she
has incurred by reason of the legal
proceedings.
[8] We respectfully agree with the observations in
PT Limited and Westfield
Management Limited v Department of Natural Resources and Mines
. We do not
consider therefore that this Court should recognize that there is a settled rule
that easy access be available to the
Land Court in mining lease applications by
way of costs not being awarded against either party other than in special cases.
each case should be considered on its merits.
[9] When exercising the discretion under s.34(1) with respect to mining lease
applications, it is legitimate for the Court to take
into account the fact that
the landholder who objects to the grant of a mining lease is exercising a
statutory right to object, in
circumstances where the grant of a mining lease
could lead to an unwelcome intrusion on to the landowner’s property.
landholders who face having their way of life and operations on their
land changed, sometimes dramatically, through mining activities
in many respects
beyond their control, should not be discouraged from pursuing proper concerns in
an appropriate manner before both
this Court and the Land Court. Similarly the
conduct of the miner in the objection and appeal process is relevant.
[10] The respondent’s success in the appeal proceedings is to be balanced
against those factors. While the rule that costs
follow the event is not
automatically applied in this jurisdiction, that rule is one which is deeply
embedded in our
and that is a
factor to be taken into account when exercising our discretion under s.34(1).
[11] Weighing all these factors, we consider that this Court’s indicative
order that the appellant should pay the first respondent’s
costs of and
incidental to the appeal should stand. It was the appellant’s conduct of
the proceedings in the Land Court which
led the Land Court to order the
appellant to pay 40% of the first respondent’s costs of the proceedings
before the Land Court.
That order was the subject of the appeal to this Court
and it is the costs of that appeal that are now in issue. We therefore affirm
the order made on 22 March 2010 that the appellant should pay the first
respondent’s costs of and incidental to the appeal.
The appellant is to pay the first respondent’s costs of and incidental
to the appeal.
