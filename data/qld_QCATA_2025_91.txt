REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
Applicant (‘Ms Bryson’) is a lot owner in the Withey Street
Community Titles Scheme
(‘the Scheme’). The Respondent (‘the Body
Corporate’) is the body corporate for the Scheme.
[2] The Scheme
comprises five lots, together with common property, being residential townhouses
at Gympie in the State of Queensland.
The Scheme is regulated by the
Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997
(Qld) (‘the BCCMA’).
adjudication application (‘the Adjudication Application’) filed with
the Office of the Commissioner for Body
Corporate and Community Management in
April 2023 and updated on 15 May 2023, Ms Bryson sought 12 orders.
decision dated 20 November 2023 (‘the Decision’), a departmental
adjudicator appointed under the BCCMA (‘the
Adjudicator’) made
various orders and refused others. These are addressed below. I note that,
although not reflected in the
formal orders, the Adjudicator stated, at
paragraph [59] of the reasons for decision, that save for the orders made, the
application
was otherwise dismissed.
substance of Ms Bryson’s complaints below involved the failure of the Body
Corporate to provide documents requested
of the BCCMA (which should
have been, but were not, provided to her) and that the Body Corporate Manager
had blocked email communications
from her so that she was not able to make
requests by email.
Application for leave to appeal or appeal filed on 1 December 2023 (‘the
Appeal Application’), Ms Bryson appeals
against each of the orders
Requirements and scope of the appeal
of the BCCMA (which appears in Chapter 6,

satisfied that the Adjudication Application was made under Chapter 6 of the
BCCMA; that the Adjudicator made an order for
the Adjudication Application
(which was not a consent order); that Ms Bryson is aggrieved by the orders; and
that Ms Bryson was the
applicant to the Adjudication Application. Consequently,
I am satisfied that Ms Bryson has satisfied the requirements of
[9] Further, the
Appeal Application was filed within the six week period required by
[10] However, Ms
Bryson may appeal to the Appeal Tribunal ‘only on a question of law’
of the BCCMA).
[11] I addressed
the meaning of, and approach to be adopted in respect of, the phrase ‘but
only on a question of law’
Taubert & Ors v Body
Corporate for Grenache CTS
I adopt the same
observations in this matter.
(a) an appeal under
of the BCCMA must be on a question of law only (or, in
other words, on a ‘pure’ question of law);
(b) the very subject matter of the appeal must be a question of law.
Powers on appeal
deciding an appeal:
(a) the powers exercisable by the Appeal Tribunal on such an appeal are those
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2009
(Qld) (‘QCAT Act’);
(b) in addition, the Appeal Tribunal may exercise all the jurisdiction and
powers of an adjudicator under the
(c) the Appeal Tribunal may amend or substitute an order only if the
adjudicator, who made the order being appealed, would have had
make the amended or substituted order or
Preliminary observations
my view, Ms Bryson’s challenge to a number of the orders appears to be
premised on challenging the Adjudicator’s
reasoning notwithstanding that,
in substance, the Adjudicator granted the order that was sought by Ms Bryson in
the Adjudication
Application.
requirements for an appeal under s 289 include that an adjudicator makes an
for the application (other than a consent order) and a person is
aggrieved by the order. An appeal can only be made against an
by the Adjudicator or the
refusal to make an order
sought from the
Adjudicator. In my view, an appeal ground is not open where it seeks to
challenge the
Adjudicator,
although the reasons
will be relevant to identifying whether an appeal ground is based only on a
question of law.
[16] In addition
to challenging the orders made, Ms Bryson sought the following additional orders
on appeal (I have anonymised the
persons named as they are not parties to the
proceeding and naming them is unnecessary; and I have also redacted the
registration
numbers in number 15):
permanent injunction to the tenant, of Lot 2, [AA], not to interfere with common
property gardens and the removal of her vehicle,
Mazda Hatch rego: 04CAV off
common property grounds.
camera attached to guttering of Lot 2, by [AA], be removed, including signage of
owner of Lot 3, [BB] remove her two vehicles, the Toyota Hiace Van rego:
[redacted] and Mazda 2 Hatchback rego: [redacted], off
common property
reimburse the sum of $330.00, for plumbing works on 24-11-2022 and invoiced to
the BC for payment on 29-11-2022.
the rocks and pebbles, the planting of intrusive garden shrubs, on common
property, in the vicinity of Lot 2, lot 4 and Lot 5,
and the occupiers
movable/personal possessions, placed on common property gardens be returned to
their original condition.
request that a penalty be imposed on [CC], from team Body Corporate, for failing
to provide the requested BC records as required
under the BCM term of engagement
when performing her secretarial duties and for breaching the code of conduct
pursuant to Schedule
2 and sec118(1)(a)(2)(Act1997).
respectful view, these orders are misconceived. They are outside the scope of
any orders that could be properly made by
the Appeal Tribunal on this appeal.
Each raises substantive matters which would need to be the subject of a separate
application
brought at first instance by Ms Bryson (subject to issues of
Consideration of grounds of appeal
noted above, there are 12 grounds of appeal. These correspond with the orders
sought below. At the hearing, Ms Bryson confirmed
that some of the orders were
‘partially accepted’. It is convenient to address Ms Bryson’s
appeal by reference
to each of the orders sought at first instance.
order sought by Ms Bryson below (and in substance again on appeal) was:
‘That the body corporate does not block an
owner the right to access
copies of body corporate records’.
Adjudicator made the following order, being Order 1 of the
The [Body Corporate] is required to accept written
communications from [Ms Bryson] provided that:
correspondence is addressed only to the postal or email address nominated for
that purpose by the Body Corporate.
maximum of one piece of written communication may be sent by [Ms Bryson] each
fortnight (addressed to the secretary of the body
corporate), unless there is an
invitation for additional written communications.
Adjudicator’s reasons for making Order 1 included the
[19] The first outcome sought by the applicant is that
the body corporate does not block an owner the right to access copies of body
corporate records.
[20] A body corporate and its committee must act reasonably in undertaking
its functions, including in making decisions. Receiving
and responding to
correspondence from owners is a normal part of the administration of a body
corporate. However I consider that,
providing it acts reasonably in doing so, a
committee is entitled to set conditions on how owners communicate with the body
to ensure that correspondence is handled efficiently and to minimise
the resource impacts and costs. For example, committees commonly
address for correspondence, a primary point of contact for queries, or request
communication in writing so that there
is a record of the issue.
[21] In the present case it is evident from the application and attachments
that the applicant has previously sent a large number
of emails to the body
corporate manager, and from December 2022 the applicant’s emails to the
body corporate manager were blocked.
Unfortunately the body corporate and
body corporate manager have chosen not to make submissions regarding this
application so I do
not have concise information regarding the quantity and
frequency of email communications from the applicant.
[22] I would point out that whether they are volunteer committee members or
paid agents of the Body Corporate, the Body Corporate
cannot reasonably expect
the recipients of correspondence to be exposed to voluminous and repetitive
requests and is entitled to
impose restrictions on unreasonable and excessive
communications. However this does not mean that the body corporate is entitled
to refuse all correspondence from the applicant, whether by physical mail or
Section 205 of the Act contemplates that a lot owner is entitled make
a request for inspection and / or copies body corporate records
failure to allow inspection or provide copies of records is an offence carrying
a maximum penalty of 20 penalty units
(footnotes omitted, emphasis added)
[22] Subsection
205(2) of the BCCMA provides:
Within 7 days after receiving a
written request from an interested person accompanied by the fee prescribed
under the regulation module
applying to the scheme, the body corporate must do
either or both of the following as requested by the interested person—
(a) permit the person to inspect the body corporate’s records;
(b) give the person a copy of a record kept by the body corporate.
Maximum penalty—20 penalty units.
Adjudicator identified (at Reasons [17]) various records that must be kept by
the Body Corporate.
Adjudicator ordered that the Body Corporate is required to accept written
communications from Ms Bryson but imposed the limitations
set out in Order 1 of
the Decision. Further, the Adjudicator imposed the limitations in circumstances
where not only such orders
sought by the Body Corporate but
where neither the Body Corporate nor the Body Corporate Manager made submissions
in response to
Ms Bryson’s application (and the Adjudicator did not have
‘concise information regarding the quantity and frequency of
communications from [Ms Bryson]’).
[25] In such
circumstances, I am of the respectful view that Ms Bryson was denied procedural
fairness or natural justice in the making
of such orders. The orders made were
inconsistent with the order sought by Ms Bryson. They were not sought by the
Body Corporate.
Further, I consider that, in the terms expressed, the Order made
was inconsistent with the operation of s 205 of the BCCMA. Section
expressed in mandatory terms and does not contemplate the limitations imposed on
Ms Bryson by the Adjudicator’s order.
It may be that it is open to an
Adjudicator to make orders in circumstances where, for example, a lot owner is
acting oppressively
in making numerous requests for information from the Body
Corporate. However, it is unnecessary to decide this issue in the present
The fact is, as noted, no such order had been sought by the Body Corporate. In
my view, the Adjudicator erred in law in making
[26] It follows
that Order 1 should be set aside. On the basis of the findings made by the
Adjudicator, I consider that the following
order should be substituted pursuant
to s 146(b) of the QCAT Act, and ss 294(1) and 276(1) of the BCCMA:
It is declared that the Body Corporate for Withey Street Townhouses CTS 15365
must, subject to
Body Corporate and Community Management Act
(Qld), within 7 days after receiving a written request from Renate
Bryson under
of the Act, accompanied by the fee prescribed under the
regulation module applying to the Withey Street Townhouses
Titles Scheme 15365, do one of the things set out in
s 205(2)(a)
and (b) of the
order sought by Ms Bryson below (and in substance again on appeal) was:
‘That I receive a copy of voting paper of motion
of the VOCM dated, 5 May
2022, for the engagement of a new service contractor.’
Adjudicator made the following order being Order 2:
Within 30 days of the date of this order, the [Body Corporate] is to provide [Ms
Bryson] with copies of any voting papers relating
to the vote outside committee
meeting dated 5 May 2022.
Adjudicator addressed this Order at Reasons [23]–[26].
[30] Ms Bryson
alleges various errors of law in relation to this Order in paragraph [03] of the
‘QCAT Appeal Document’
attached to the Appeal Application.
substance, Ms Bryson appears to attack the legal reasoning of the Adjudicator.
In my view, the submissions are, with respect,
misconceived. Ms Bryson sought a
specific order and, in my view, the Adjudicator made an order that gave Ms
Bryson the substantive
relief sought by her (and I consider that the terms of
the order made were appropriate, rather than the specific terms of the order
sought by Ms Bryson).
[32] Ms Bryson
has failed to establish that the Adjudicator erred in law in failing to make the
Order sought.
order sought by Ms Bryson below (and again on appeal) was: ‘That I receive
a copy of voting paper and notice of meeting
of the withdrawal of engagement of
previous service contractor, Mr & Mrs Property Maintenance.’
Adjudicator made the following order being Order 3:
Within 30 days of the date of this order, the [Body Corporate] is to provide to
[Ms Bryson] copies of any documents relating to the
termination of the contract
with ‘Mr & Mrs Property Maintenance’.
Adjudicator addressed this Order at Reasons [27]–[29]. As the Adjudicator
observed, correctly in my view, the order
sought was based on the assumption
that the termination of the contractor was voted on at a general meeting, and
that if such a document
existed it should be provided but if no such document
was in existence, it could not be provided. The order made by the Adjudicator
reflected that position.
[36] Ms Bryson
says that Order 3 is ‘partially accepted’ but alleges various errors
of law in relation to this Order in
paragraph [04] of the ‘QCAT Appeal
Document’ attached to the Appeal Application.
respectful view, the only contention of Ms Bryson which raises an arguable error
of law was that the Adjudicator should
have ordered the Body Corporate to
provide any such document within 7 days of the date of the order, consistently
with the requirements
of the BCCMA. However, I consider that, given
the elapse of time, there would be no utility in substituting an order in the
terms save for specifying period of 7 days rather than 30 days. The
challenge to Ground 4 is rejected.
order sought by Ms Bryson below was: ‘That I receive a copy of the motion
of general meeting that ratified the allocations
of common property to four
owners/occupiers for their personal use.’
[39] On appeal,
Ms Bryson below seeks the following order: ‘To receive a copy of motion of
general meeting that ratified allocations
of common property to four owner [sic]
and a tenant, for their personal use.’
Adjudicator refused the Order sought.
Adjudicator addressed this Order at Reasons [29]–[34]. The Adjudicator
observed that it would appear that Ms Bryson
was making an assumption that the
owners of the other four lots in the Scheme had been granted exclusive use of
areas of common property
(other than those areas over which exclusive use was
granted by the community management statement executed on 13 October 1997
the use of the courtyard areas identified) and there was no further
evidence of exclusive use being granted by way of resolution
without dissent.
Although not stated expressly, it was plain that the Adjudicator was not
satisfied that there was any motion falling
within the scope of Order 4.
[42] Ms Bryson
alleges various errors of law in relation to this Order in paragraphs [05] and
[06] of the ‘QCAT Appeal Document’
attached to the Appeal
Application. As best I understand Ms Bryson submissions, they assert that the
Adjudicator erred in failing
to have regard to various statutory provisions and
that, amongst other matters, the Adjudicator ‘failed to make an order that
owners submit a motion to a general meeting to use common property gardens as
their own, requiring a resolution without dissent’.
In substance, Ms
Bryson appears to be seeking substantive relief in relation to what appears to
be an allegation of wrongful use
of areas of common property. However, the order
sought was merely for provision of the relevant motion (if it existed).
[43] Ms Bryson
has failed to establish that the Adjudicator erred in law in failing to make the
Order sought.
order sought by Ms Bryson below was: ‘That I receive a copy of voting
paper motion of plumbing works on 24/11/2022
and invoiced on
29/11/2022.’
[45] On appeal,
Ms Bryson seeks the following order: ‘To receive a copy of voting paper of
VOCM, of plumbing works ($330.00)
on 24/11/2022 and invoiced on
29/11/2022.’
Adjudicator made the following order, being Order 4:
Within 30 days of the date of this order, the [Body Corporate] is to provide [Ms
Bryson] with copies of any documents relating to
the engagement of
“Newk’s Plumbing” to undertake plumbing work which was
invoiced to the [Body Corporate] on 29
November 2022.
Adjudicator addressed this Order at Reasons [35]–[38].
[48] Ms Bryson
says that Order 5 is ‘partially accepted’ but submits, amongst other
matters, that the committee secretary
does not have the power to take $330.00
from body corporate funds and the committee secretary should reimburse the Body
the sum of $330.00 (see paragraph [07] of the ‘QCAT Appeal
Document’ attached to the Appeal Application).
[49] In my view,
the submissions are, with respect, misconceived. Ms Bryson sought a specific
order concerning provision of a specified
document and, in my view, the
Adjudicator made an order that gave Ms Bryson the substantive relief sought by
her (and I consider
that the terms of the order made are appropriate, rather
than the specific terms of the order sought by Ms Bryson).
[50] Ms Bryson
has failed to establish that the Adjudicator erred in law in failing to make the
Order sought.
order sought by Ms Bryson below (and in substance again on appeal) was:
‘That I receive a copy of the Work Order processed
14/11/2022.’
Adjudicator made the following order being Order 5:
Within 30 days of the date of this order, the [Body Corporate] is to provide to
[Ms Bryson] a copy of the work order processed on
14 November 2022.
Adjudicator addressed this Order at Reasons [39]–[40].
[54] Ms Bryson
says that Order 6 is ‘partially accepted’ but contends that the
Adjudicator erred in law in his reasons
for decision (see paragraph [08] of the
‘QCAT Appeal Document’ attached to the Appeal Application).
[55] Once again,
the Adjudicator made an order that gave Ms Bryson the substantive relief sought
by her (and I consider that the terms
of the order made were appropriate, rather
than the specific terms of the order sought by Ms Bryson).
[56] Ms Bryson
has failed to establish that the Adjudicator erred in law in failing to make the
Order sought.
order sought by Ms Bryson below (and in substance again on appeal) was:
‘That I receive a copy of voting paper motion
of VOCM dated 17/10/2022,
approval of quote for the sum of $715.00.’
Adjudicator made the following order being Order 6:
Within 30 days of the date of this order, the [Body Corporate] is to provide [Ms
Bryson] with copies of any documents such as notice
of motion and voting papers
relating to the committee decision on 17 October 2022 to engage “Garden
and Yard Maintenance”
to undertake mould removal work at a cost of $715.
Adjudicator addressed this Order at Reasons [41]–[43].
[60] Ms Bryson
says that Order 7 is ‘partially accepted’ but contends that the
Adjudicator erred in law in his reasons
for decision (see paragraph [09] of the
‘QCAT Appeal Document’ attached to the Appeal Application).
[61] Ms Bryson
sought a specific order and, in my view, the Adjudicator made an order that gave
Ms Bryson the substantive relief sought
by her (and I consider that the terms of
the order made appropriate, rather than the specific terms of the order sought
by Ms Bryson).
[62] Ms Bryson
has failed to establish that the Adjudicator erred in law in failing to make the
Order sought.
order sought by Ms Bryson below (and in substance again on appeal) was:
‘That I receive a copy of the voting paper
motion that $156.75 be paid to
[the Body Corporate Manager] to approve a quote.’
Adjudicator made the following order being Order 7:
Within 30 days of the date of this order, the [Body Corporate] is to provide [Ms
Bryson] with copies of any documents relating to
the committee decision
engagement pay [sic, to pay] the sum of $156.75 to the body corporate manager to
approve Quote WS102202 from
Garden & Yard Maintenance.
Adjudicator addressed this Order at Reasons [44]–[46].
[66] Ms Bryson
says that Order 8 is ‘partially accepted’ but contends that the
Adjudicator erred in law in his reasons
for decision (see paragraph [10] of the
‘QCAT Appeal Document’ attached to the Appeal Application).
substance, Ms Bryson appears to attack the legal reasoning of the Adjudicator.
In my view, the submissions are, with respect,
misconceived. Ms Bryson sought a
specific order and, in my view, the Adjudicator made an order that gave Ms
Bryson the substantive
relief sought by her (and I consider that the terms of
the order made were appropriate, rather than the specific terms of the order
sought by Ms Bryson).
[68] Ms Bryson
has failed to establish that the Adjudicator erred in law in failing to make the
Order sought.
order sought by Ms Bryson below (and in substance again on appeal) was:
‘That I receive a copy of the previous committee
meeting/VOCM that were to
be attached to Minutes of Committee Meeting of the 26/05/2022.’
Adjudicator refused the Order sought.
Adjudicator addressed this Order at Reasons [47]–[49]. The Adjudicator
[Ms Bryson] believes that these minutes should refer to a motion to confirm the
minutes of the preceding meeting. I have reviewed
these minutes and note that
there is no reference to such a motion, nor is there a reference to attach
minutes. On the material at
hand it would therefore appear that these minutes
are incomplete and I believe that the body corporate committee should ensure
an amended version of these minutes prepared and distributed to lot owners.
[72] Ms Bryson
alleges various errors of law in relation to this Order in paragraph [11] of the
‘QCAT Appeal Document’
attached to the Appeal Application.
substance, Ms Bryson appears to attack the legal reasoning of the Adjudicator.
In my view, the submissions are, with respect,
misconceived. The Adjudicator
found no evidence of the motion sought. This is a factual matter. There was no
basis for the making
of the Order sought by Ms Bryson.
[74] Ms Bryson
has failed to establish that the Adjudicator erred in law in failing to make the
Order sought.
order sought by Ms Bryson below (and in substance again on appeal) was:
‘That I receive a copy of the voting sheet
of motions submitted by the
four owners/occupiers to be allocated parts of common property for the personal
Adjudicator refused the Order sought.
Adjudicator addressed this Order at Reasons [50]–[52]. On its face, Order
10 appears to be interrelated with Order
[78] Ms Bryson
alleges various errors of law in relation to this Order in paragraph [12] of the
‘QCAT Appeal Document’
attached to the Appeal Application. The
thrust of the submissions were that the Adjudicator ‘used his discretion
at a decision that is not a just and equitable [sic] when an
owner’s proprietary rights and interest in the common property
denied.’ The Order sought was ‘a copy of the voting sheet of motions
submitted by the four owners/occupiers ...’.
I adopt my observations in
relation to Order 4 at [41] and [42] above.
[79] Ms Bryson
has failed to establish that the Adjudicator erred in law in failing to make the
Order sought.
order sought by Ms Bryson below (and in substance again on appeal) was:
‘That I receive a copy of the Form 1 notice,

Adjudicator addressed this Order at Reasons [53]–[54]. The Adjudicator
stated that: ‘The material at hand does

‘QCAT Appeal Document’

the submissions challenged the Adjudicator’s finding of fact.
[84] Ms Bryson
has failed to establish that the Adjudicator erred in law in failing to make the
Order sought.
order sought by Ms Bryson before the Adjudicator was: ‘Requiring the BC
manager to comply with the terms of their engagement
and authorisation’.
The reference to the ‘BC manager’ is a reference to the Body
Corporate Manager engaged by the
Body Corporate. The Order sought was framed in
the broadest of terms.
Adjudicator refused the Order sought.
[87] On appeal,
Ms Bryson seeks the following order:
The [Body Corporate Manager] to comply with the mandated statute, including, the
terms of their engagement when performing the secretarial
duties for this BC
[88] In my view,
Ms Bryson has failed to demonstrate any question of law in respect of which the
Adjudicator arguably erred in refusing
to make the Order sought.
[89] First, on
the face of the order sought, Ms Bryson was seeking an order directly against
the Body Corporate Manager. In my view,
it was not a ‘dispute’
within the meaning of s 227 of the
and the Adjudicator had no
[90] Second, if
contrary to the above view, the dispute could be characterised as one between
the Body Corporate and the Body Corporate
Manager (as referred to by the
Adjudicator in the Reasons for Decision at [55]), the Adjudicator observed that
it would be a dispute
the engagement of the person as a body corporate manager and such a dispute
would be required to be dealt with by the Tribunal or a specialist adjudicator
by virtue of s 149B of the BCCMA. Ms Bryson has not
raised any challenge to this
conclusion.
[91] Third, the
apparent kernel of the complaint in relation to the Body Corporate Manager
concerns the blocking Ms Bryson’s
emails which is directly related to the
subject matter of Order 1. I consider that, even if Order 12 could be agitated
the Body Corporate’s obligation in relation to the provision of
information has been addressed in the substituted order made
in respect of Order
Bryson seeks both the costs of the adjudication fee below and the costs of the
filing fee of the Appeal Application in the
[93] As to the
adjudication fee below, s 280 of the BCCMA provides:
(1) This section applies if—
(a) the applicant for an adjudication application made a conciliation
application for the same dispute; and
(b) the respondent to the adjudication application was the respondent to the
conciliation application; and
(c) the commissioner ended the conciliation application under section 252K
because the respondent failed, without reasonable excuse,
to participate in the
department conciliation.
(2) If asked by the applicant, the adjudicator may order the respondent to pay
to the applicant the amount paid by the applicant
under section 239(1)(c) as
fees for the conciliation application and adjudication application
[94] I have not
been able to identify the evidence that s 280(1)(c) was satisfied or that Ms
Bryson made a request as contemplated
by s 280(2). In those circumstances, Ms
Bryson has not established that the Adjudicator erred in failing to make such an
her favour.
[95] As to the
filing costs of the Appeal Application, the Appeal Tribunal has power to award
costs for a proceeding under the QCAT

as provided under this Act or an enabling Act, each party to a proceeding must
