Understrength: The state of

This article discusses enforcement of the

) in contrast to two recent regulatory actions in Europe. It argues
that a combination of factors means that the OAIC’s enforcement
capabilities are understrength and therefore insufficiently protect the privacy
of individuals in Australia.
Recent regulatory action
In Europe, privacy regulators are sending clear signals that companies need
to take collection, use and disclosure of personal information
seriously. On 16
October, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s

for an inadequate response to a cyber-security
This comes on the back of
a A$57 million (€35 million) fine issued to clothing retailer
H&M by the Hamburg Data Protection
Commissioner.
This fine – the
second highest ever at the time – was despite the Hamburg Commissioner
saying that H&M’s response
was ‘an unprecedented acknowledgement
of corporate responsibility following a data protection

determinations relating to privacy breaches. On 11 September,

order for aggravated damages.
This raises the question of why there is such a stark disparity between
Australian and European privacy law enforcement action.
Apples and Oranges
First it should be noted that the comparison is somewhat unfair – the
decisions made in Europe related to GDPR violations that
affected many more
individuals. The OAIC investigations each had only one complainant, whereas the
ICO investigation related to over
400 000 individuals and the H&M
investigation involved highly detailed dossiers on several hundred employees.
But this just raises
another question –
why is the OAIC not
pursuing large companies for violating privacy law?
Damages or fines
, the Information Commissioner can make a
‘determination’ that an organisation has interfered with the privacy
of individuals.
Such a determination can include an order to pay monetary
compensation to those individuals. The
also provides for
‘civil penalties’ – i.e. fines – to be imposed where an
organisation has either repeatedly
violated individual’s privacy or
engaged in a serious violation of
Damages for interfering with privacy
The Information Commissioner determinations referred to above included orders
for damages. However, these orders provided for relatively
small amounts to be
paid to the complainants. These amounts pale in comparison to the amounts of
compensation that are being paid
in Europe under the GDPR. Part of the reason
for this lies in the principles that are applied in assessing damages for
breaches of
. The case of
Rummery and Federal Privacy
Commissioner
established
• where a complaint is substantiated and loss or damage is suffered,
the legislation contemplates some form of redress in the
ordinary course;
awards should be restrained
but not minimal;
• in measuring compensation, the principles of damages applied in tort
law will assist, although the ultimate guide is the words
of the statute;
• compensation should be assessed having regard to the
complainant’s reaction and not to the perceived reaction of the
of the community or of a reasonable person in similar circumstances.
The upshot of these principles – the second one in particular –
is individuals do not receive large amounts of compensation
for privacy
violations. This disincentivises the protection personal information. The effect
of such low awards is that the consequences
of getting caught are lower than the
costs of putting in place preventive technical and organisational measures.
Enforcement policy and resourcing
The consequences of getting caught are further lowered by the approach that
the OAIC takes in responding to privacy complaints. First,
there is a statutory
obligation when investigating a complaint, to make a reasonable attempt to
conciliate the complaint.
this, the OAIC’s ‘preferred regulatory approach ... is to work with
entities to facilitate legal and best practice
compliance.’
In other words,
it does not take a robust approach to dealing with inferences with privacy.
This focus is reflected in the relatively small amount of Commissioner
decisions dealing with Privacy as opposed to the other part
of the OAIC’s
work – freedom of information. As of 17 October 2020, the Commissioner has
handed down 53 determinations
this year. Only seven of these have related to
OAIC Enforcement is also being hampered by funding constraints. Recently it
was revealed that
the agency failed to achieve seven of its eight performance goals for the
2019-20 financial year, heightening fears that it is not
adequately resourced to
conduct its important role.
The effect of this is that investigations into complaints are not able to be
completed on a timely basis. Moreover, the OAIC is less
able to initiate
investigations on its own initiative. Accordingly, the likelihood of being
caught violating privacy is also low.
It is also important to note that the
first Australian class action flowing from a privacy violation was
covered by state legislation,
and the matter settled for an undisclosed
What about fines?
So far, this article has focused on compensation. Another aspect of the OAICs
enforcement powers are civil penalties. As noted above,
civil penalties can only
be issued if there is a repeated violation or the violation is serious enough to
warrant such penalties.
To date, there have been no civil penalties issued for
serious or repeated violations of privacy. However, this may change soon.

for civil penalty

This matter is still in the pre-trial stage, and it is unlikely that there
will be judgment this year. That means that there will
five years between the initial disclosure of the misconduct and
any penalty. Thus, the civil penalty process is slow and, in light
of the fact
that it involves court proceedings, costly. Compare the H&M breach which was
discovered in October 2019 and where
the fine was issued in October 2020. The
British Airways breach to fine timeframe – June 2018 to 16 October 2020
also considerably shorter than the OAIC’s Facebook matter.
Reform stalled
In March 2019, the Federal Attorney-General and Communication Minister
announced proposed reforms to federal privacy law. The reforms
