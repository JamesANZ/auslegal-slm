COURTS OR TRIBUNALS EXERCISING JURISDICTION IN MINING MATTERS - SOUTH
Mining Act 1971
, fossicking
[2010] SAWC
1 I note that Mr Jongedan is not present today. I understand from my staff
that he gave a mobile phone number for the last sitting
of court. I have no
additional information from him and I did ring the mobile phone number 0432 277
521 but it went straight to
message bank. I now proceed in his absence.
2 I have received a helpful submission from Ms Spikin from the Department of
Primary Industries & Resources with which is consistent
with my own
research. I am dealing with an objection for a Notice of Entry that is
regulated by
which requires that:
A mining operator must, at least 21 days before first entering land to carry
out mining operations, serve on the owner of the land
notice of intention to
enter the land.
3 ‘Mining operations’ is defined in the Act as all operations
carried out in the course of prospecting, exploring or mining
for minerals, et
cetera ‘but does not include ... fossicking’.
‘Fossicking’ is defined as meaning:
The gathering of minerals –
(a) as a recreation; and
(b) without any intention to sell the minerals or utilise them for a
commercial or industrial purpose,
but does not include the gathering of minerals by any means involving
disturbance of land or water by machinery or explosives.
4 The Notice of Entry given here says it is for the purpose of:
Fossicking – prospecting. Use of metal detectors/gathering of rock
chip samples/use of hand tools only.
5 I note that Mr Jongedan does not disclose a miner’s right to the
Notice of Entry although I am told that he does have a current
one. As the
situation stands the Notice of Entry is defective for two reasons:
1. It does not disclose the miner’s right number.
2. It discloses an activity which, on the face of it, constitutes fossicking
which is not a mining operation.
6 ‘Prospecting’, on the other hand, is defined in the Act:
Operations of any kind in the course of exploring for minerals except such as
involve the disturbance of land or water by machinery
or explosives and
‘to prospect’ has a corresponding meaning.
7 The purpose of prospecting is to ascertain the existence of a potentially
commercial resource and, following that, to peg a claim,
develop a proposed
mining operation, obtain the lease and exploit the resource.
8 The fact that Mr Jongedan is not intending to prospect in the meaning of
the Act is confirmed in Item 3 of the Notice of Entry where
The operations intended are nil. Fossicking only – area under EL, plus
mineral tenements in the vicinity.
9 Accordingly, the Notice of Entry procedure for mining operations has no
application. Mr Jongedan, if he wishes to fossick, must
obtain the permission
of the landowners under the general law dealing with rights of entry on private
has no operation. The application to prevent
entry under the Notice of Entry is upheld and I refuse entry for a mining
under the present Notice of Entry.
10 I further note that there have been previous notices of entry by Mr
Jongedan. One dealt was dealt with in cause 02/374 and one
was dealt with in
cause 04/355 and, on each of those occasions, permission was given on terms.
What I am saying in this order is
consistent with those previous orders. The
application here makes it clear that it is for a limited purpose of fossicking
have made it clear the Act has no application to that. Further, I note
that if the purpose were prospecting then one might think
that there has been
ample opportunity to pursue that purpose under the previous permissions.
11 Whether Mr and Mrs Kelly let Mr Jongedan enter their land for the purpose
of fossicking is a matter between the parties that this
court has no
that they are not giving permission
to Mr Jongedan to enter their land for the
purpose of fossicking.
