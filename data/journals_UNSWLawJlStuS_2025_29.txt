ANALYSIS ON DETAINEE BEHAVIOUR INTERVENTION FRAMEWORK IN NEW SOUTH WALES,

I INTRODUCTION
In the criminal justice system, incapacitation of offenders is utilised as
part of criminal procedure or
punishment.
Incapacitation has
several purposes, including imposing a deterrent effect, maintaining public
order, and protecting society from
In Australian jurisdiction,
Australian courts have long emphasised that the purpose of criminal sentencing
is the protection of society
and that community protection can be achieved by
preventing criminal behaviour through the incapacitation of the
academic debates, the most effective way to ensure the restriction of the
movement of offenders is through detention or
imprisonment.
effectiveness of incapacitation for offenders is still the basis of various
policies, including juvenile justice.
New South Wales (‘NSW’), Australia, regulates a juvenile justice
system under the
Young Offenders Act 1997
(NSW), addressing young people
aged between 10 and 17 when they allegedly committed the

protecting society and preventing
young people from committing
Thus, the NSW
Government developed some strategies, in addition to the incapacitation of young
offenders, these strategies aim to
provide guidance for officers working in
juvenile justice facilities.
In 2009, the NSW Government introduced the Detainee Behaviour Intervention
Framework (‘DBIF’), which is based on a comprehensive
review of the

this article will
analyse the emergence of the DBIF policy and compare it to its implementation in
practice, with a particular focus
on critiquing its reliance on a risk-based
assessment approach. Furthermore, it will examine broader issues arising from
the policy,
such as the use of a ‘more-to-jargon’ approach regarding
the use of force. The article will also explore alternative
strategies that
could more effectively address the concerns raised by DBIF policy. In addition,
it will present arguments and analyses
concerning the impact of current DBIF
policies on vulnerable children, specifically children with disabilities and
young Indigenous
II THE EMERGENCE OF THE DBIF POLICY
In 2009, the number of young people in detention in NSW began to increase
consistently over the following ten years, with no fewer
than 450 young people
in detention at any given
57% of that number spend
approximately one week in
Additionally, half of this group were Aboriginal young people, despite
comprising only about 4% of the youth population in

safety, NSW takes measures to manage and mitigate these
effectively.
The DBIF was developed in 2009 and was fully implemented in

framework, the Behaviour Project Steering Committee has conducted an extensive
consultation process with key stakeholders

AND BROADER ISSUES

Rises of Risk-Based Assessment
The use of risk-based assessment has been recognised in various jurisdictions
around the worl

a valid method to analyse the risks and needs of offenders, supporting
decision-making and the implementation of
prevention and intervention
Using risk assessment,
the criminal justice decision-makers are asked to measure how low or high the

in delinquent activity or

One assumed
risk-based evaluation benefit is that it provides a more accurate identification
than subjective assessment by criminal
justice decision-makers or clinical
Thus, studies that
support the use of risk assessments for young offenders are gaining ground in
the Australian jurisdiction
particularly in
NSW, as part of the main strategies, such as risk-based assessment used through
DBIF policy
However, even though
risk-based assessment has been accepted worldwide as one of the best practices
in the juvenile justice system
this approach
has some critiques.
Critiques of Risk-Based Assessment for Young Offenders
(a) Focus on Risk: Overlooking Potential and Increasing Harm to Young
In the world of academic research, young people are considered interesting

Therefore, the dynamism of

These risk factors, such as
peer relationships, school, behavioural problems across settings, family,
substance use, personal attitudes,
and mental health, can change rapidly, which
means that a youth's level of risk is dynamic or not static over
For this reason, some
scholars then call young offenders a ‘moving target’ in the context
of assessment
Hence, overemphasis
on the risk assessment of young offenders may lead to incomplete
assessments
The incomplete assessments mean the risk component becomes the dominant basis

juvenile justice systems

will be discussed in the next part of this article.
(b) Overemphasis on Risk Led to Stigmatisation of Young People in the
Juvenile Justice System
The lack of focus on protective factors or strengths may lead to
over-predicting risk, resulting in over-predicting
dangerousness
An over-predicted

money. For young offenders, over-predicting
dangerousness often results in
harsher measures under the assumption that they will reduce
Ultimately, all of these
conditions contribute to a stigma that young people in the criminal justice
system are dangerous.
Stigmatisation can arise from community and
self-stigma
Young people who are
involved in the criminal justice system are among the most stigmatised of
marginalised populations in
This stigma often
continues into post-custody life, limiting their access to needs such as
employment, certain public benefits, community
activities or at least difficulty
in returning to society without negative

is self-stigma, and contact with the criminal justice system is one condition

One of the most
problematic components of self-stigma is internalised stigma, when a person has
accepted a negative stereotype and
made it their
Internalised stigma can
worsen a person’s condition, which is more to be concerned with young
The relationship between risk and stigma is evident. Moreover, discussions
also extend to how risk-based assessments perpetuate stigma
associated with
certain conditions, such as disability stereotypes and Indigenous people. People
with disability, particularly people
with mental illness, suffer discrimination
against their human rights in their daily
This situation often
creates a complex relationship between people with disabilities and society,
leading to social isolation
Risk-based assessment can be highly biased against people with disabilities. The
conditions that people with disabilities experience,
such as various
neurological and intellectual difficulties, may lead to higher risk
assessments
People with
disabilities who have been socially isolated may be unfairly classified as a
risk for their antisocial
In the NSW context,
especially in the criminal justice setting, this issue has been identified in
the example when bail for people
with disability is denied due to the
availability of mental health and disability support services in an
applicant’s living
Risk-based assessments tend to emphasise the limitations of people with
disabilities, viewing their condition as a risk factor. As
discussed in this

To be fair, like any other assessment method, risk-based assessment is
influenced by its user
of the long-standing risk-based assessment is that the development of this

B The Use of Force: The Last Resort That Used
In July 2016, a video documentary entitled ‘Australia's Shame: The
Brutalisation of Children Behind Bars’ shocked Australia.
It depicted the
horrific events that occurred to children in detention in Australia's Northern
Territory (‘NT’), specifically
at Don Dale Youth Detention Centre
(‘Don Dale’)
detainees were placed in isolation confinement with no access to sunlight or
running water
other incidents
described how these children were subjected to harsh treatment and use of force
by being stripped naked, assaulted
tear-gassed
In response to the
reports, then Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced the
establishment of a Royal Commission into
the Protection and Detention of
Children in the Northern Territory (the ‘Royal
Commission’)
aims of the Royal Commission, among its objectives, was to evaluate the
violations of children's rights in Don
The allegations of
children’s rights violations in detention facilities have long been a
serious topic addressed by the Australian
The abuses that
occurred at Don Dale are believed to have occurred in other detention centres
across Australia
When the ABC News documentary aired, Australian Children’s Commissioner
Megan Mitchell, in an article, supported the information
towards young people in detention, said: ‘It was clear that use of
isolation was routinely and frequently
used and for very long periods of time
and when I say frequently and routinely I mean 23 hours a day for several
She then added that
the use of force was used frequently in the detention
Moreover, a brief
report from Amnesty International indicates that in the last six months before
the Royal Commission was established,
several incidents of child abuse have been
exposed in every state and territory in
Internationally, the regulation of the use of force for children in various
settings is part of the United Nations Committee on the
Rights of the Child
(‘UNCRC’) concerns. Australia has ratified the

Rights of the Children

fully responsible for implementing its mandate under international

UNCRC’s 2007

the UNCRC emphasised the limitation

when the child

secondly only when all other measures have been
In addition to those
two minimum conditions, the use of force must be carried out under the direct
control and close monitoring of
medical and/or psychological
professionals
Accordingly,
Australia should apply high standards concerning the use of force in youth
However, in reality, the excessive use of force has always been noted in
various reports related to complaints of violations in youth
facilities in Australia
Australia has always been associated with the use of abusive measures, even
using inhumane treatment and physical

Following Don
Dale’s coverage and various reports and reviews, the Australian Government
has set a reform agenda based on the
recommendations
The NSW Government, particularly, had actually taken steps to regulate the
use of force long before the Don Dale coverage. In the
development of DBIF in
2009, NSW claimed that the use of force was one of the sections reviewed
in-depth and involved external
In the DBIF, the use
of force is used as a last resort or as a necessary response to a
DBIF also claims that
every staff must have skills in the effective use of reactive procedures and the
use of force
That said, the
DBIF appears to follow the principle of using force only as a last resort.
However, in practice, DBIF does not appear to align with its principle of
using force as a last resort. Amnesty International has
reported incidents
similar to those of Don Dale across Australia, including
Following the Don Dale
report in July 2016, Amnesty highlighted those abuses against children in

Amnesty cited a
news report published by The Sydney Morning Herald in October 2016, just three
months after the Don Dale report,
which detailed conditions at the Cobham Youth
Detention Centre in Sydney. In one case, a youth detainee was locked in custody
23 hours alone
In another,
a young detainee was held in solitary confinement for 8 days for performing
gravity on the walls of the detention
These examples reflect
the pattern of force being used in youth detention facilities; it can be seen
that the use of force is not
uncommon, with NSW being no exception.

and 22 July 2019. A subsequent ministerial review of the

DBIF’s claim that the use of force will be the last resort did not
match the practice. Use of force is still not uncommon in
NSW. The justification
for the use of force will always be based on the stigma that young offenders are
dangerous and that the use
of force is

stated that there is tension between the administration of justice and children

As a result, the use
of force is not the last resort, and it is only jargon that does not occur in
the context of implementation.
IV ALTERNATIVE APPROACH AND POLICIES RECOMMENDATION TO
UPHOLD THE BEST INTEREST FOR THE CHILDREN
A Focus on Strength, Reduce Risk
While criticisms of the weaknesses of risk-based assessment have been made
earlier in this article, one area of concern is that risk-based
assessment did
not control for intervening
Although many studies
explicitly mention the high accuracy and predictive validity of risk-based
assessments, understanding the contextual
experience of those risk factors would
provide a better understanding of the offender's
This weakness means that
risk-based assessments are likely to have limitations in giving accurate
intervention recommendations for
young people because of incomplete
assessments
Incomplete assessment can lead to many problems. Therefore, many studies have
begun to develop instruments that do not focus entirely

For that reason,
scholars have paid more attention to the use of a strengths
Scholars have argued
that protective factors in the form of strengths enable more effective

have shown empirical and academic evidence of the use of strengths in
A study reviewed and
identified 10 strength-based assessments that were associated with predicting

summary of the studies illustrates strong evidence for the positive impact of
strength-based assessment, with over 90% of the
studies reviewed showing that
combined strength scores were significant for recidivism

prosocial attitudes, positive peer relationships,
and community support, are

people. These impacts include the stigma

between young people in criminal justice and a
significantly increased likelihood of
The formal criminal
justice process also increases the risk of
For this reason,
scholars assert that contact with the criminal justice system is inherently
criminogenic
The negative impact of criminal justice on young people has led to the
introduction of diversionary mechanisms that provide an alternative
approach to
young people’s cases
Diversion programmes have evolved from simply keeping children out of the
process to a more complex approach involving psychosocial
programmes,
psychoeducation, and therapy
The goal is to divert children from the conventional criminal justice process
and allow them to avoid the criminogenic stigma of
being labelled as
One form of diversion, often applied in lower-risk young people, is through
law enforcement’s discretional power not to put
charges against young
Other forms of
diversion involve imposing legal charges on young people, but the young people
are diverted to an alternative system;
this alternative system can be a
follow-up programme in which the young people must agree to participate; when
the young people successfully
complete the diversion programme, the legal
proceedings will be dismissed
Support for diversion has gained ground from various studies. Diversion is
believed to be more effective in reducing recidivism rates
than the traditional
criminal justice system
diversion without alternative systems is also more effective for lower-risk
situations than diversion-involved
Because it is more
effective, diversion can save the law enforcement budget and shift to more
serious, problematic, and high-risk
populations
Ultimately,
diversion is better for the children’s best interest, as it avoids the
adverse effects of a more conventional criminal
justice system.
Restorative Justice: Because Crime Hurts, Justice Should
Diversion is a step that should be encouraged in the best interests of the
children, but the actions taken by young offenders may
hurt others, the
community, or even the young people
Restorative Justice
(‘RJ’) was born to focus on the consequences of crime and the wounds
that justice must heal
focuses on restoring relationships between stakeholders when the crime
In juvenile justice, as a form of diversion, RJ was introduced as a critique
of a highly punitive traditional criminal justice system
concerned with
retribution rather than healing the
Although RJ was born
with sensitivity to the interests of
RJ processes involve
open dialogue, emphasising offender responsibility and fostering offender
empathy, this can have a positive
impact on changing offender behaviour and
providing healing to victims
Some studies indicate that RJ reduces recidivism and is more effective at
preventing re-offending than the conventional criminal justice
It also provides higher
victim satisfaction than the formal process
For offenders, RJ not
only avoids the risk of long-term harm associated with the legal process, but it
also increases protective
factors for the young
An inclusive process
also brings benefits such as increased public trust in law
enforcement
The perspective of
public trust in the fairness of the legal process is critical because the
parties will be more cooperative and
accept the results if they consider the
process fair
However, RJ does not come without criticism; RJ is often perceived as gender
and race-biased because of the potential of power dynamics
Therefore, RJ is likely
to be abused by those with greater privilege or higher power
Positioning RJ as a
solution without addressing injustice will make RJ a continuation of the broken
system that RJ currently
That is why RJ
should not be placed alone without criticising the broader problem of
RJ is not useful if
the criminal justice system is targeting unprivileged-minority groups such as
young Indigenous people. In a biased
and racist system, approaches such as RJ
will be pointless. In conclusion, RJ should be encouraged and constantly
but RJ should be
positioned as a critique of injustice, not the extension of
Raise the Minimum Age of Criminal Responsibility
As a State Party to the
, Australia has an obligation to guarantee
children’s rights
to guarantee these rights is to prevent children from the adverse effects of
criminal justice, which can be achieved by raising
the minimum age of criminal
responsibility (‘MACR’). In the Universal Periodic Review
(‘UPR’) process in
2021, 27 countries recommended that Australia
raise the MACR
recommendation came not only from the UPR process but also from Australian
government bodies
The UNCRC has
recommended a minimum age of 12 for MACR, although it continues to encourage the
country to reach a more ideal age
Given the devastating impact
of the criminal justice system on children and that punishment, including
imprisonment, is not a solution
raising the MACR is crucial. Children at a very young age or at least under 13
years old have a limited view of
involving cognitive
maturity, mental vulnerability and personal
Criminal justice is
clearly not the solution.
This article has explained the dangers of young people contact with the
criminal justice system. The reality of ongoing discrimination
should be a
strong consideration for Australia in raising MACR. Australia has an
overrepresentation of Indigenous children in the
criminal justice system.
Although Australia recognises the principle of
doli incapax
, it does not
provide definitive protection for vulnerable
According to the
latest data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
(‘AIHW’), Indigenous young people are
27 times more likely to be in
There is insufficient
evidence to suggest that
doli incapax
prevents the formal justice process
for children
children are still placed in
detention, and it is ultimately young Indigenous people who will be
overrepresented in detention.
Harm Reduction and Drug Policy Reform
NSW still criminalises drug use, and these statutes also apply to individuals
As a result, children
continue to come into contact with the criminal justice system and may face
sanctions such as warnings, fines,
probation, or
rehabilitation
relation to the diversion of children from the criminal justice system, an issue
that cannot be ignored is drug policy.
The war on drugs has had a devastating
impact globally
including on children. In
addition to the criminalisation of drug consumption, one form that potentially
violates human rights and

Mandatory rehabilitation for PWUD is unnecessary. Data from the United

that only 13% of

At the same time,
research has shown that interventions without compulsory programmes can have
better outcomes for children as long
as they avoid formal
To prevent the
adverse effects of the legal system, NSW should start to apply a holistic drug
policy reform, apply harm reduction
and continue to divert children from the
formal legal system.
Detention as the Last Resort
The stigmatisation of children often begins when they are placed in
detention, as detention is frequently perceived as a form of
Ideally, children
should be removed from the formal criminal justice process altogether, but in
practice, the use of detention is
often difficult to avoid. Therefore,
international standards emphasise that the detention of children should be used
only as a last
resort and for the shortest possible
In addition to the
UNCRC, this principle is also supported by the United Nations Standard Minimum
Rules for the Administration of
Juvenile Justice (the ‘Beijing
Rules’) that institutionalisation should be minimal and limited to
necessary cases
further highlights the importance of prioritising non-custodial measures and
ensuring that the best interests of the child
are central to all decisions
within the criminal justice system
In line with the principle that detention should be the last resort for
children, several additional measures need to be considered
by policymakers. The
first is the bail system. This system is often biased by social class and
economic status
When a certain
amount of bail is imposed, children from low-income families or those without a
fixed place of residence may struggle
to meet the
requirements
This situation
disproportionately affects vulnerable children, particularly Indigenous children
and those from marginalised
communities
important factor is legal aid. Legal aid plays a vital role in protecting the
rights of children in conflict with the
law, especially those from disadvantaged
backgrounds
With access to
legal aid, the legal rights of these children can be safeguarded, reducing the
likelihood that they will be unnecessarily
drawn into the criminal justice
system or placed in detention
Justice Reinvestment
In 2024, about 2 in 3 young people aged 10–17 in detention were young
Indigenous people, yet young Indigenous people made up
only 6.6% of the
Australian population in that age
As a result of these
high rates of incapacitation, young Indigenous people experience complex trauma,
as well as problems with society,
family, and the formal education
This leads to prolonged
trauma and structural issues, and, of course,
Australia has wasted billions of dollars to incarcerate Indigenous children
through a failed system to reduce recidivism rates. In
2016 alone, Australia
spent $3.9 billion on incarcerated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander

system’s failure has led to an initiative to refocus funding away from the
formal criminal justice system
to a direct community approach, called Justice
reinvestment
reinvestment was first introduced in 2003 in the United States with the aim of
reducing imprisonment
Australia, this approach began in 2009 with the initiative of Aboriginal
organisations and lobbies from the Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander Social
Justice Commissioner, Tom Calma
In NSW, justice reinvestment is intended to encourage Indigenous people
communities to develop and pursue solutions to reduce the
children with the criminal justice
At NSW, the justice reinvestment program is well implemented in some areas.
In 2018, a report from KPMG showed that there was a 23
per cent reduction in
offences, including domestic violence, a 38 per cent reduction in crimes
committed by young people, a 14 per
cent reduction in behaviour resulting in
bail breaches, and ultimately this approach resulted in a 42 per cent reduction
spent in custody
12th year, justice reinvestment is showing positive impacts on the well-being of
Indigenous people, increased employment,
and increased school attendance for
In addition, in 2017,
NSW saved an estimated $3.1 million in the criminal justice budget from this
The NSW Government has
expanded the reach of the program to include other areas such as Moree, Kempsey
Cowra and Mount Druitt
agreement on young people and criminal justice has been made, contact with
criminal justice is
‘criminogenic’
Hence, encouraging justice reinvestment programmes is a form of investment in
itself. With more concrete results than criminal justice
ever did, policymakers
in NSW need to more systematically and consistently promote justice
reinvestment.
V CONCLUSION
The Detainee Behaviour Intervention Framework in New South Wales was
introduced as a strategy for managing juvenile justice, with
the stated aim of
reducing a detainee’s risk of reoffending. However, this article has
critically examined the limitations
of the DBIF, particularly its overreliance
on risk-based assessments that focus heavily on identifying risk while
neglecting protective
factors or individual strengths. This overemphasis on risk
contributes to the stigmatisation of young people in the criminal justice
and overlooks their potential for better intervention program and
rehabilitation. Such assessments disproportionately impact
marginalised youth,
particularly children with disabilities and young Indigenous people, by
reinforcing harmful stereotypes and justifying
punitive interventions such as
excessive use of force and incapacitation.
Despite the DBIF’s stated principle of using force as a last resort, in
practice, the use of force remains frequent and has
become a routine response.
This situation is further worsened by serious concerns regarding staff training
and capability, which
undermine the framework’s implementation and raise
broader issues of rights violations and institutional accountability.
For young people, contact with the criminal justice system is widely
recognised as criminogenic; harsh punishment not only fails to
reoffending but also creates further harm. Given these circumstances, this
article has proposed several alternative approaches
that focus on prioritise the
best interests of the child. Shifting the focus from risk-based to
strength-based assessments is essential
to minimise harm and support positive
development. Diversion programs and restorative justice approaches have proven
more effective
in reducing recidivism and facilitating reintegration. Raising
the minimum age of criminal responsibility is also critical to protecting
vulnerable children from the damaging effects of early criminalisation.
Additionally, drug policy reform grounded in harm reduction
principles would
mitigate the harm experienced by children with drug-related issues. Finally,
justice reinvestment presents a cost-effective,
community-led solution that has
already shown promising results in NSW.

Don’t Punish’ is a global advocacy campaign in the drug policy
reform agenda, calling for harm reduction-based
drug policies, specifically
health and human rights. This movement inspired the idea of protecting
vulnerable groups from harmful
regulation. In this context, youth or children in
criminal justice are those vulnerable groups who suffer from harmful regulation
in a biased and punitive system. See
