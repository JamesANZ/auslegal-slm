REASONS FOR DETERMINATION
PERRAM J (DEPUTY PRESIDENT):
1 The President has referred to me Mr Sandilands’ application to file a
proceeding in this Tribunal. At my suggestion, Mr Sandilands
appeared before
the Tribunal on 7 June 2022. He explained that he wished to apply to the
Tribunal under
(Cth) for a determination
of remuneration.
Section 183
183 Use of copyright material for the services of the Crown
(1) The copyright in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work or a
published edition of such a work, or in a sound recording,
cinematograph film,
television broadcast or sound broadcast, is not infringed by the Commonwealth or
a State, or by a person authorized
in writing by the Commonwealth or a State,
doing any acts comprised in the copyright if the acts are done for the services
Commonwealth or State.
(2) Where the Government of the Commonwealth has made an agreement or
arrangement with the Government of some other country for the
supply to that
country of goods required for the defence of that country:
(a) the doing of any act in connexion with the supply of those goods in
pursuance of the agreement or arrangement; and
(b) the sale to any person of such of those goods as are not required for the
purposes of the agreement or arrangement;
shall, for the purposes of the
last preceding subsection, be each deemed to be for the services of the
Commonwealth.
(3) Authority may be given under subsection (1) before or after the acts in
respect of which the authority is given have been done,
and may be given to a
person notwithstanding that he or she has a licence granted by, or binding on,
the owner of the copyright to
do the acts.
(4) Where an act comprised in a copyright has been done under subsection (1),
the Commonwealth or State shall, as soon as possible,
unless it appears to the
Commonwealth or State that it would be contrary to the public interest to do so,
inform the owner of the
shall furnish him or her with such information as to the doing of the act as
or she from time to time reasonably requires.
(5) Where an act comprised in a copyright has been done under subsection (1),
the terms for the doing of the act are such terms as
are, whether before or
after the act is done, agreed between the Commonwealth or the State and the
owner of the copyright or, in
default of agreement, as are fixed by the
(6) An agreement or licence (whether made or granted before or after the
commencement of this Act) fixing the terms upon which a
person other than the
Commonwealth or a State may do acts comprised in a copyright is inoperative with
respect to the doing of those
acts, after the commencement of this Act, under
subsection (1), unless the agreement or licence has been approved by:
(a) in the case of the Commonwealth—the Minister; or
(b) in the case of a State—the Minister of the State with responsibility
for copyright.
(7) Where an article is sold and the sale is not, by virtue of subsection (1),
an infringement of a copyright, the purchaser of the
article, and a person
claiming through him or her, is entitled to deal with the article as if the
Commonwealth or State were the
owner of that copyright.
(8) An act done under subsection (1) does not constitute publication of a work
or other subject‑matter and shall not be taken
into account in the
application of any provision of this Act relating to the duration of any
(9) Where an exclusive licence is in force in relation to any copyright, the
preceding subsections of this section have effect
as if any reference in those
subsections to the owner of the copyright were a reference to the exclusive

work or other subject‑matter for the educational
purposes of an
educational institution of, or under the control of, the Commonwealth, a State,
the Australian Capital Territory or
the Northern Territory shall, for the
purposes of this section, be deemed not to be an act done for the services of
the Commonwealth,
that State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern
2 As Mr Sandilands explained, his contention was that he had sent a report to
the Prime Minister in 2002. The report was prepared
by Mr Sandilands whilst at
the University of Western Sydney. He says that the Commonwealth and the States
have acknowledged his
report and he is therefore entitled to remuneration from
the Tribunal in the sum of $120 million per annum. He says this sum should
awarded from 6 December 2002 and should be paid to him in the form of 10-year
Treasury Bonds.
3 What may be remunerated by the Tribunal under
is acts done by the
Commonwealth (or the States) pursuant to the statutory licence under
, the acts in question would be infringements of the copyright.
It is therefore necessary to identify, at least in an outline way,
comprised in the copyright which the Commonwealth has done under
necessity these acts are, in the case of a literary work (which is what Mr
Sandilands relies upon), set out in
which in its present form is:
31 Nature of copyright in original works
(1) For the purposes of this Act, unless the contrary intention appears,
(a) in the case of a literary, dramatic or musical work, to do all or any of the
following acts:
(i) to reproduce the work in a material form;
(ii) to publish the work;
(iii) to perform the work in public;
(iv) to communicate the work to the public;
(vi) to make an adaptation of the work;
(vii) to do, in relation to a work that is an adaptation of the
first‑mentioned work, any of the acts specified in relation
first‑mentioned work in subparagraphs (i) to (iv), inclusive;
4 Focussing, for the sake of clarity, on the reproduction and publishing
rights in sub-ss (1)(a)(i) and (ii), it would be necessary
for Mr Sandilands to
identify those acts of reproduction and publishing which he says the
Commonwealth (or the States) have engaged
in before any question of remuneration
could be meaningful. For example, if Mr Sandilands alleged that
the Commonwealth had widely published his report or reproduced many
it, it would be meaningful to inquire into what compensation might be due by the
Commonwealth to Mr Sandilands for those
5 However, all that Mr Sandilands alleges is that the Commonwealth and the
States acknowledged his report. Since the acknowledgement
of a literary work is
not one of the rights which comprises the copyright set out in
follows that Mr Sandilands’ proposed application for remuneration under
does not disclose a cognisable claim under
6 Apart from these problems, Mr Sandilands’ paperwork suffers from
several formal defects. For example, it does not comply
Regulations 2017
(Cth) inasmuch as it is not in the required form.
Regulation 97(2)
requires an application under s 183(5) to set out the following
97 Application under subsection 183(5) of the Act
(2) The application must set out the circumstances or events giving rise to the
application and, in particular, must:
(a) identify the work or other subject‑matter to which the application
relates; and
(b) identify the act; and
(c) state whether the applicant is:
(i) the owner or exclusive licensee of the copyright in the work or other
subject‑matter; or
(ii) the Commonwealth; or
(iii) a State; and
(d) if the applicant is the owner or exclusive licensee of the copyright:
(i) state whether the act was or is to be done by the Commonwealth, a State or a
person authorised by the Commonwealth or a State;
(ii) if the act was or is to be done by a State or a person authorised by a
State—identify the State; and
(e) if the applicant is the Commonwealth or a State—state the name of the
owner or exclusive licensee of the copyright.
7 It will be observed that the substantive difficulty I have identified above
is reflected in the formal deficiency in Mr Sandilands’
paperwork because
it does not identify the act in respect of which remuneration is due.
8 In those circumstances, I direct the Registrar not to accept Mr
Sandilands’ documents for filing.
I certify that the preceding eight (8) numbered
paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Determination of the Tribunal
