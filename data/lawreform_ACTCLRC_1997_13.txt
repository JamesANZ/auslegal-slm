The ACT established the Community Law Reform Committee
in July 1990.
The purpose of the Committee is to:
. help the Government to identify areas in need of reform;
. anticipate emerging social and legal issues; and
. assess the practical impact of various proposals and
laws on the people of the ACT.
The Committee's Secretariat is at 2nd floor, GIO Building,

Rules of Court: Preliminary Considerations
Dear Attorney-General
This report details preliminary considerations concerning the Committee's
reference on Rules of the Court. The Committee makes this
report pursuant
to a reference to the Committee.

Rules of Court: Preliminary Considerations
Introduction
1. The objectives of any system of justice may be summarised as follows:
the maintenance of human rights;
the ascertainment of truth;
the determination and application of appropriate principles of law;
the sublimation of conflict;
the affirmation of important community values; and
the provision of procedural safeguards.
The importance of these objectives is not always acknowledged within
public comments on the need for reform which often seem to assume
challenge is limited to producing the greatest number of decisions for the
least cost. On the other hand, there has sometimes
been a 'siege mentality'
in which almost any proposed change is seen as an attack on long cherished
values of freedom and justice.
Yet the extent to which these objectives
can be achieved depends in part upon the extent to which ordinary members
of the community
can gain access to the system and that is in turn dependent
upon the extent to which the cost of justice can be contained.
2. In recent years there have been many procedural changes designed to
clarify issues or otherwise assist the judicial process. Some
of these have
had the effect of shortening proceedings and hence reducing the cost borne
by the litigants. Others may have had some
marginal impact on court budgets
but only at the expense of increasing the financial burden on litigants.
The proposals in this discussion
paper are directed primarily to reducing
this burden. They are intended to reduce the cost of justice by the adoption
uniform rules of procedure. This should have the effect of reducing
confusion, enabling the resolution of all issues in the one court,
facilitating
the efficient transfer of proceedings from one court to another when necessary,
and generally saving litigants time
and hence money. It is also anticipated
that they should enable some further improvement in the efficient use of
court resources.
3. A comprehensive review of the procedures of both courts would require
considerable time and expense and it seems appropriate to
raise a few central
issues for comment before proceeding further. Indeed, the resolution of
those issues may be determine the manner
in which the path of reform is
further explored. Consequently this paper has been confined to those issues.
Procedural inconsistencies in ACT courts
4. The procedures employed in the Supreme Court and the Magistrates Court
of this territory differ widely. That difference is the
product of different
legislative schemes. At present the procedure in the Magistrates Court is
governed largely by the provisions
of the Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction)
Act. The procedure of the Supreme Court is governed by rules of court which
are determined
by the judges pursuant to
Supreme Court
on the advice of the Rules Committee and by practice directions issued
by the Registrar. This diversity of approach has led to numerous
differences
in their respective practices and procedures. For present purposes it is
unnecessary to provide a catalogue of all such
differences but the following
may serve as examples:
A notice to admit facts in the Magistrates Court requires a response
within 21 days failing which the person upon whom it has been
served will
be taken to have admitted them (section 157). A similar notice in the Supreme
Court requires a response within 14
days and failure to respond involves
no such admission (order 35
Section 135 of the Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act provides
that pleadings may be amended to add further causes of action
arising out
of the same or substantially the same facts even if the limitation period
has expired. This provision effectively
abrogates the common law rule in
Weldon v Neal
[1887] 19 QBD 394
(see generally "Amendments
and Limitations: The rule in
Weldon v Neal
[1980] 54 ALJ 643).
is no comparable provision in the
Supreme Court Act
. Hence, a Supreme Court
judge may be unable to grant the same relief as a magistrate would be able
to grant in similar circumstances.
However, if the matter were to be transferred
to the Federal Court under the cross-vesting legislation that court could
the terms of section 62 of the Federal Court Act which are similar
to section 135.
In the Magistrates Court a plaintiff must serve medical reports 14 days
prior to trial (section 199) whilst in the Supreme Court
a plaintiff must
normally do so 56 days before the trial date is even determined (Order
39 rule 46).
The rates used for calculating pre-judgment interest are different,
with 9% currently prevailing in the Magistrates Court and 10%
in the Supreme
Court (section 230 of the Magistrates Court (Civil Jurisdiction) Act and
Practice direction 1 of 1993 in the Supreme
The need for substantial uniformity
5. Uniform procedures would have a number of advantages, including the
(a) reducing costs by enabling lawyers to find the relevant rules more
quickly and to consult common annotations and/or case notes;
(b) reducing the potential for confusion as to whether authorities dealing
with rules in one court apply to a comparable but
different rule in another;
(c) reducing the likelihood of litigants having to pay unnecessary costs
as a result of procedural mistakes;
(d) reducing the cost of maintaining a constant revision of rules;
(e) facilitating the transfer of proceedings from one court to the other
without unnecessary delay or expense;
6. Of course, there might be circumstances in which adherence to an otherwise
uniform procedure might prove inappropriate and the
rules would need to
provide some measure of flexibility. On the other hand, a committee or other
body charged with maintaining a
generally uniform approach might ensure
that procedural reforms developed in for one court received due consideration
in the other
and that the impetus for reform was maintained. For example,
moves to develop a 'fast track' for certain types of cases in one court
might easily flow on to a consideration of whether such a development could
be adapted to cases in the other.
Rules of court or statutory prescription?
7. The first issue that arises in any proposal for uniformity is whether
the procedure should be determined by rules of court or by
statute. In his
1990 discussion paper, 'Review of Court Structures in the Australian Capital
Territory', Lindsay Curtis AM, suggested
that it was generally inappropriate
for the Executive to determine the rules of procedure since the Australian
Capital Territory
was a frequent litigant and could be seen to be devising
or maintaining the structure most conducive to its own interests. Such perceptions
are not unimportant but it should also be remembered that the Legislative
Assembly has an overriding responsibility for the administration
of justice.
Statutory prescription, as presently governs procedure in the Magistrates
Court, provides the Assembly with a clear means
of directly determining
what procedures should be adopted. However, it also gives provides a basis
for the concern expressed by Mr
Curtis. Furthermore, every procedural change
is expensive and time consuming. Any continuing program of reform would
encounter constant
8. On the other hand, rules of court may be more quickly and with less
expense. They have been adopted in the superior courts in England
and Australia
and it would be desirable to have the rules of the ACT courts compatible
with those of the Federal Court. It is suggested
that this mechanism be
preserved and extended to the Magistrates Court. Any concern about lack
of Assembly control could be ameliorated
by the provision of a statutory
power of disallowance.
A common rules committee
9. Common rules of court could be conveniently formulated by a single
rules committee. This could be formed by simply adding a representative
of the Magistrates Court to the existing rules committee of the Supreme
Court and expanding its responsibilities to embrace both
courts. Both the
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the Chief Magistrate have been consulted
10. There may be a need to depart from an otherwise uniform approach
in relation to particular types of cases in one court or the
example, the Magistrates Court would be free to decide that interrogatories
should not be delivered in Small Claims matters
without leave. The nature
and extent of such departures would need to be determined within the context
of a more extensive procedural
A common format
11. The format would be substantially the same as that followed in the
existing rules of the Supreme Court with each rule applying
to all proceedings
in both courts subject only to stipulated departures where necessary. Hence
the rules would continue to be grouped
within 'orders' dealing with particular
topics and practitioners would know that, say, order 35 rule 3 governed
notices to admit
facts in both courts. Any departures would be dealt with
by qualifications to those rules. This would enable a single set of rules
and annotations and reduce the ACT Civil Practice from two volumes to one.
12. In the longer term, there could be a complete revision of the rules
by the joint rules committee perhaps assisted by the former
master or some
other consultant engaged for the purpose. That review might also facilitate
substantial conformity with the Federal
Court rules.
Common pleadings
13. The use of common forms of pleadings would also assist practitioners
and facilitate the transfer of proceedings from one court
to another when
necessary. An easier process of transfer might encourage greater use of
the Magistrates Court in circumstances where
it is thought that the damages
are likely to fall within the existing jurisdictional limit but there is
some chance that subsequent
events may require revision of that assessment.
Common terminology
14. The use of common terminology would reduce confusion. There is no
apparent need for the document requiring a potential witness
to attend the
Magistrates Court to be called a summons whilst the corresponding document
in the Supreme Court is called a subpoena.
A summons in the latter court
is a pleading initiating proceedings against the person upon whom it is
The elimination of jurisdictional anomalies
15. It may be protested that the procedure in the Magistrates Court should
be less complex than that which prevails in the Supreme
Court. This view
is based upon the assumption that cases heard in that court are necessarily
less complex but that view is not necessarily
correct. Complex issues may
arise in many cases in which the range of damages is insufficient to prevent
them from being heard in
the Magistrates Court. Such cases may well require
the same procedures as a comparable case in the Supreme Court. There should
scope for distinguishing between different types of cases but it is not
generally appropriate to determine procedures by reference
to the identity
of the court in which the case is litigated rather than the nature and complexity
of the case itself. This point
may be illustrated by workers compensation
cases involving disabilities progressively exacerbated by successive periods
of employment
covered by different insurers. In such cases the Magistrates
Court may determine the liability of the respondents collectively but
not apportion that liability amongst them. Determination of who should contribute
requires further litigation in the Supreme
Court even though the magistrate
has usually heard all of the evidence relevant to that issue. This again
involves needless delay
and expense. One would expect that anomalies of
that kind would readily be identified and corrected by a joint rules committee
in essence, with rationalising the system of justice facilitated
by the two courts.
16. Disincentives to commence proceedings in the Magistrates Court such
as that provided by lower rates of interest could also be
identified and
eliminated.
Facilitating a single administrative service.
17. In the longer term, common rules, pleadings and terminology should
be conducive to common procedures in the registries. For example,
could be common scales of costs subject only to flexibility based upon the
complexity of the proceedings in question and common
taxation procedures.
Similarly, there could be common filing procedures, albeit with some differentiation
in fees. Indeed, it might
be a convenient means of moving towards a common
administrative service under the supervision of a single chief executive
This would enable greater efficiency and perhaps provide some savings
in the budgets allocated for both courts. Again, this proposal
would require
further consideration in due course.
Further reforms
18. There may well be scope for further reforming the procedures in both
courts, particularly in terms of case management regimes
for particular
basic issues identified in this short paper.
Are there to be common procedures?
If so, how are they to be determined? By whom are they to be determined?
The resolution of these
issues will determine at least the broad direction
in which future reform must proceed.
