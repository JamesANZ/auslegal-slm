STATEMENT OF REASONS
INTRODUCTION
Schutz (claimant) was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 26 August 2023
(accident). On 30 November 2023, Mr Schutz made
an application for personal
injury benefits under the
Motor Accident Injuries Act 2017
(MAI Act) on
AAI Limited t/as GIO (insurer).
21 December 2023, the insurer accepted liability for statutory benefits for up
to 52 weeks after the accident. This entitles Mr
Schutz, inter alia, to weekly
payments of statutory benefits.
dispute has arisen between Mr Schutz and the insurer as to the correct
calculation of his post-accident earnings. This dispute primarily
arises as Mr
Schutz is a self-employed business owner.
summary, the insurer submits that Mr Schutz’s post-accident earnings
should be calculated based on his profit and loss statements
for specific
periods as he does not draw a wage. Mr Schutz submits that, due to the nature of
his business, this would be unfair
and instead his post-accident earnings should
be calculated based on the full financial year.
2 clause 1(a) provides that the amount of statutory benefits that is payable
under Division 3.3 is declared to be a merit
review matter for the purposes of
Part 7 of the MAI Act. As this dispute has been the subject of an internal
review, s 7.11 of the
MAI Act has been satisfied and the jurisdiction of the
Personal Injury Commission (the Commission) is enlivened.
Relevant legislation
Schutz’s entitlement to weekly payments arises from Part 3 of the MAI Act.
Relevantly, ss 3.5 to 3.7 of Division 3.3 of the
MAI Act provide:
“3.5 Definitions

(b) in the case of partial loss of earnings—85%,
of the difference between the person’s pre-accident weekly earnings and
the person’s post-accident earning capacity (if
any) or post-accident
earnings, whichever is the greater, after the first entitlement period.
(3) A weekly payment of statutory benefits to a person under this section

(4) A weekly payment of statutory benefits to a person under this section
is not to be less than the minimum weekly statutory benefits
amount or the
person’s pre-accident weekly earnings, whichever is the lesser.”
3.23 provides that weekly payments of statutory benefits are payable on a
fortnightly basis unless the Motor Accident Guidelines
(Guidelines) otherwise
provide or the parties to a claim otherwise agree.
1 sets out relevant definitions for the purposes of weekly payments of statutory
benefits under Division 3.3, including the
meaning of “earner”,
“loss of earnings”, “pre-accident weekly earnings” and
“post-accident
earning capacity”.
Relevantly,
cl 3 of Sch 1 provides:
“3 Meaning of “loss of
(1) Loss of earnings means a loss incurred or likely to be incurred in a
person’s income from personal exertion.
(2) A person’s income from personal exertion is—

of the person’s business,
(b) rents or dividends, or
(c) any employer superannuation contributions, or
(d) the monetary amount of any annual, sick or other leave entitlement.
is not in dispute that, due to the operation of s 6.13 of the MAI Act and
regulation 8A of the Motor Accident Injuries Regulation
2017 (Regulations), Mr
Schutz is not entitled to payment of statutory benefits for any period prior to
30 November 2023.
Procedural history
preliminary conferences were held in this matter.
the first preliminary conference on 10 March 2025, Mr Schutz’s
pre-accident weekly earnings (PAWE) was in issue, as was the
correct calculation
of his post-accident weekly earnings. The insurer sought and Mr Schutz agreed to
provide additional information
on these issues.
was also brought to the parties’ attention that several of the documents
referred to Mr Schutz’s entitlement to weekly
payments as commencing on 7
December 2023 rather than 30 November 2023. The parties confirmed that the
correct commencement date
is 30 November 2023. It was agreed that Mr Schutz is
only entitled to statutory benefits from the date his claim was made, being
November 2023, to 24 August 2024.
noted above, a key aspect of this dispute is the method of calculating Mr
Schutz’s “post-accident earnings”.
As this issue involves
principles of statutory interpretation regarding the MAI Act, I provided the
parties with an opportunity to
make submissions on this point.
7 May 2025, a second preliminary conference was held in this matter. This was
primarily for the purpose of resolving an interlocutory
dispute between the
parties, being whether the insurer should be provided with an opportunity to
obtain an expert report from a forensic
accountant. This was opposed by the
claimant. For the reasons set out in the preliminary conference report, I
considered that the
interests of justice weighed in favour of granting the
insurer leave to obtain and rely on an expert report from a forensic accountant.
Directions were made accordingly.
receipt of the parties’ evidence and submissions, I noted that the
claimant’s certificates of fitness / certificates
of capacity had not been
provided. In response to a query raised through the Portal and at the 7 May 2025
preliminary conference,
the parties confirmed that, despite the relevant
certificates of fitness / certificates of capacity certifying periods of
capacity and periods of fitness for pre-injury duties, the insurer
made no earning capacity decision and assessed Mr Schutz’s
entitlement to
weekly benefits based on his post-accident earnings. Mr Schutz’s
post-accident earnings is agreed by the parties
to be the relevant measure of
his earning capacity.
Accordingly,
the parties agreed that Mr Schutz’s post-accident earning capacity is not
in issue and the dispute is confined
to the issue of Mr Schutz’s
post-accident earnings as opposed to his post-accident earning capacity. Whether
s 3.7(2)(a) or
(b) of the MAI Act applies will depend on whether the Commission
determines that Mr Schutz had a total or partial loss of earnings
first entitlement period.
12 June 2025, following receipt and service of the insurer qualified forensic
accountant report, the insurer conceded that the
Mr Schutz’s PAWE ought to
be calculated as $2,340.85.
On the papers
52(3) of the PIC Act provides:
“(3) If the Commission is
satisfied that sufficient information has been supplied to it in connection with
proceedings, the
Commission may exercise functions under this Act and enabling
legislation without holding any conference or formal hearing.”
the parties have submitted that it is appropriate for this dispute to be
determined on the papers and without holding a formal
considered s 52 of the PIC Act, Procedural Direction PIC2 and the documents
before me, I am satisfied that I have sufficient
information available to me to
allow me to determine the issues in dispute ‘on the papers’ and
without holding a formal
hearing, and that this is the appropriate course in the
circumstances.
SUBMISSIONS
insurer has conceded that Mr Schutz’s PAWE should be calculated as
the insurer’s submissions in respect of the statutory benefit percentage
to be applied, the claimant’s qualified
forensic accountant, Furzer
Crestani, conceded that they had applied the incorrect statutory benefit
percentage in their initial
Accordingly,
the parties’ submissions and evidence on these points have not been
summarised.
Claimant’s submissions
Schutz relies on submissions dated 4 April 2025 and 17 July 2025.
Schutz submits that any entitlement to weekly benefits is to be assessed
pursuant to s 3.7 of the MAI Act and that, although he
was certified with some
capacity and was performing limited duties within the business, he has suffered
a total loss of earnings.
Accordingly, Mr Schutz submits that he is entitled to
80% of his PAWE.
Schutz relies on the supplementary report of Mr Chris Katehos of Furzer Crestani
Forensic Accountants dated 7 July 2025. Mr Katehos
reviewed the report of Lance
Kahler of Vincents. He opines that Mr Schutz’s earnings should be
considered over the entire financial
year as this provides a fairer basis for
the calculation.
Schutz submits that the full financial year approach is similar to how
depreciation was treated by Mr Katehos when assessing his
PAWE. It is submitted
that, placing the accelerated benefit allowed by the ATO into one financial year
would work unfairly to a claimant
when calculating PAWE. Similarly, trying to
isolate earnings in closed periods within a financial year can also operate
Schutz points to the observations made by Mr Katehos that:
profits for the period 7.12.23 to 31.03.24 is positive ($50,488) and for the
period 26.08.23 to 6.12.23 is negative ($59,814),
which is highly unusual and
suggestive of timing issues in respect of recording
annual expenses are applied. If the examination is limited to closed periods
this creates artificial inflation. It is not appropriate
pick” certain periods, and a more balanced and fair approach is to
consider the average of the relevant post-accident
Schutz submits that there are three major flaws in the methodology adopted by
Vincents, as set out at paragraph 9 of Mr Katehos’s
supplementary report.
Schutz submits that his earnings for the period 30 November 2023 to 24 August
2024 (38.86 weeks) were nil. Accordingly, Mr Schutz
submits that he is entitled
to be paid 80% of his PAWE ($2,340.85), being $1,872.68 x 38.86 weeks =
$72,767.00 less amount of $15,939.96
received. This results in $56,827.00 owed
by the insurer.
respect of his earning capacity / loss of earnings, Mr Schutz submits that
weekly payments are calculated, in the context of self-employment,
reference to income from personal exertion: Sch 1 cl 3 of the MAI Act.
Relevantly, Mr Schutz relies on subclause (2)(b) which
defines a person’s
income from personal exertion to be the proceeds of any business carried on by
the person either alone or
in partnership with any other person.

Insurer’s submissions
insurer relies on submissions dated 24 February 2025 and 10 June 2025.
insurer’s submissions dated 10 June 2025 concede that Mr Schutz’s
weekly payments are payable from 30 November 2023,
being the date on which he
made his claim.
5 June 2024, the insurer determined that Mr Schutz had not suffered a loss of
income during the period 7 December 2023 and 31 March
2024. This decision was
affirmed on internal review in a decision dated 21 June 2024.
insurer notes that Mr Schutz’s profit and loss statement for the period 7
December 2023 to 31 March 2024 reveals a net profit
of $35,107.06. The insurer
therefore calculated his earnings during his period to be an average of
$1,881.69 per week. As this exceeded
the insurer’s initial calculation of
Mr Schutz’s PAWE, the insurer determined that he had not suffered a loss
30 July 2024, the insurer determined that Mr Schutz was entitled to weekly
benefits of $6,438.21 for the period 7 December 2023
to 30 June 2024. On 22
August 2024, an internal review varied this decision such that the claimant was
entitled to $8,004.05 for
this period.
insurer notes Mr Schutz’s profit and loss statement for the period 1 April
2024 to 30 June 2024 revealed a net loss of $20,055.77.
The insurer calculated
Mr Schutz’s earnings during this period to be nil, and therefore his
entitlement to weekly benefits
for this period to be $769.62 x 13 weeks x 80% =
insurer notes Mr Schutz’s profit and loss statement for the period 1 July
2024 to 24 August 2024 revealed an operating profit
of $766.01 and a net loss of
$656.04. The insurer calculated Mr Schutz’s entitlement during this period
(7.86 weeks) as $6,049.21
(PAWE of $769.62 x 7.86 weeks) - $766.01 (operating
profit) x 85% = $4,658.36. Accordingly, on 16 September 2024, the insurer
that Mr Schutz was entitled to weekly benefits of $4,658.36 for the
period 1 July 2024 to 24 August 2024.
insurer notes that Mr Schutz’s profit and loss statements for the
financial year ending 30 June 2024 suggests an overall
profit of $40,699.40.
insurer submits that Mr Schutz’s individual tax return and notice of
assessment for the financial year ending 30 June 2024
is inconsistent with his
profit and loss statements.
insurer agrees that the dispute is confined to the issue of Mr Schutz’s
post-accident earnings, as opposed to post-accident
earning capacity.
insurer relies on the report of Lance Kahler dated 21 May 2025, which opines:
Katehos’s conclusion that the claimant’s post-accident earnings
should be assessed as Nil includes the significant
trading losses incurred by
the claimant during the first entitlement period.
respect to statutory benefits payable during the second entitlement period, the
MAI Act specifically states that the benefit
payable is the relevant percentage
of the difference between the person’s pre-accident weekly earnings and
the person’s
post-accident earning capacity (if any) or post-accident
earnings, whichever is greater, after the first entitlement period.
Post-accident
earnings during the second entitlement period must be based on the
claimant’s earnings after the end of the first
entitlement period; and
a self-employed claimant has produced periodic post-accident trading results, it
is appropriate to calculate the claimant’s
post-accident earnings during
the relevant distinct periods, noting the likely changes in post-accident
earnings as a claimant’s
capacity for work changes from time to time.
Kahler relied on the profit and loss statements provided by Mr Schutz for the
period 7 December 2023 to 24 August 2024 and adopted
the same approach to assess
his post-accident earnings as was used to assess his PAWE. Mr Kahler assessed Mr
Schutz’s post-accident
earnings as:
average of $1,745.61 per week during the period 7 December 2023 to 31 March
for the period 1 April 2024 to 24 August 2024.
was calculated to be an entitlement of $47,954 before tax for the period 30
November 2023 to 24 August 2024. The insurer conceded
there has been an
underpayment of $32,014.
insurer submits that utilising Mr Schutz’s earnings over the full 2024
financial year to assess his entitlement to weekly
benefits for the period 30
November 2023 to 24 August 2024 will result in him being compensated for periods
during which he is not
entitled to weekly benefits.

regarding this issue have not been summarised.
Application for
personal injury benefits
Schutz’s application for personal injury benefits dated 30 November 2023
has been considered. Relevantly, this notes that
he was off work for one week
due to the accident and that he is a self-employed “timber worker /
sawmill”. His earnings
at the time of the accident are noted as

have been considered. It is noted that these have
been heavily redacted to
exclude non-business transactions.
Furzer Crestani Forensic
Report dated 19 December 2024
report of Chris Katehos of Furzer Crestani Forensic dated 19 December 2024 has
been considered. It was noted that Mr Schutz has
been able to return to limited
duties in a reduced capacity.
Katehos examined Mr Schutz’s 2023 financial year personal income tax
return and noted that he declared a profit of $40,128
from his business
activities. His largest expense for the year was depreciation of $104,426. Mr
Katehos noted this depreciation expense
was extraordinarily large relative to
the level of turnover and required further investigation.
Katehos noted that the 2024 financial year depreciation expense was $16,030.
on the supporting documentation, the basis for the 2023 financial year
depreciation expense was due to the purchase and immediate
off” of three assets. Mr Katehos opined that the company’s tax agent
has taken advantage of tax legislation
and applied accelerated depreciation
expense deductibility provisions. He opined that the true economic annual
depreciation expense
of the business in the 2023 financial year was $19,401.
Katehos opined that the true profits of the claimant’s business was:
for the 2023 financial year;
for the period 1 July 2023 to 25 August 2023, and
loss of $11,031 for the full 2024 financial year. This translates to a loss of
$26,609 for the post-accident period of 26 August
2023 to 30 June
Katehos calculated Mr Schutz’s PAWE to be $2,340.85.
respect of Mr Schutz’s post-accident earnings, Mr Katehos assumed a
post-accident income of Nil, notwithstanding that he
determined Mr Schutz had
incurred trading losses.
Katehos calculated Mr Schutz’s underpayment as $61,375 for the period 30
November 2023 to 52 weeks post-accident, at an entitlement

notes that the Vincents Report at VR 3.6 and 3.7 agreed with the PAWE
calculation of $2,340.85.
Katehos summarises Mr Schutz’s profit and loss statements for periods in
the 2024 financial year as

Total (FY2024)
Katehos opines that it is highly unusual that gross profit is negative in the
period 1 July 2023 to 25 August
This suggests timing issues
with the recording of sales and/or timing issues with the recording of cost of
sale items.
Katehos also observes that there are significant variations in the trading
results for the three post-accident trading periods,
where two periods recorded
losses, one recorded a profit, and an overall loss of $29,422 was recorded in
the post-accident period.
opines that the non-apportionment of expenses over all periods may have been
captured in one period only. For example, annual expenses
recorded in the period
1 April 2024 to 30 June 2024 that were not recorded in the other three periods
of the 2024 financial year.
For example, depreciation of $16,030 and public
liability insurance of $1,547.
Katehos also notes potential timing issues with the recording of expenses. For
example, even though sales are higher in the period
7 December 2023 to 31 March
2024 compared to the period 1 April 2024 to 30 June 2024, expenses are
significantly lower. He opines
that this suggests an artificial inflation in
notional profit in the period 7 December 2023 to 31 March 2024, which is to the
benefit. He provides the following analysis:

Katehos opines that it is not appropriate to “cherry pick” certain
periods as undertaken in the Vincents Report, as
it appears that a number of
discrepancies have arisen due to the accounting treatment and timing recognition
of income and expenses
in the profit and loss statements of the different
Katehos opines that the appropriate approach is to consider the average of the
total post-accident period. This will “iron
out” any fluctuations
caused by the factors identified above.
respect of the Vincents Report, Mr Katehos opines that the assessment of the
claimant’s post-accident earnings is artificially
higher in the period 30
November 2023 to 31 March 2024 to the insurer’s benefit due to:
not attempting to assess the claimant’s post-accident earnings for the
period 30 November 2023 to 6 December 2023 and
instead relying on the
claimant’s profit and loss statements for the period from 7 December 2023
to 24 August 2024. Mr Katehos
assumes that, had Vincents undertaken a similar
exercise to that he performed, it would be difficult to explain the significant
fluctuations
in post-accident recorded results;
the Vincents Report recognised that depreciation expense is an annual expense
and should be amortised over the full year rather
than captured in one period,
it failed to undertake a similar exercise for public liability insurance nor
consider the possibility
that other expenses have been recorded on a similar
failing to consider and make adjustments for why costs and expenses were
significantly lower in the first period (7 December
2023 to 31 March 2024)
compared with the second period (1 April 2024 to 30 June 2024) despite sales
being higher.
Katehos prepared updated calculations on Mr Schutz’s “PAWE
underpayment” using the 80% rate, opining that this
is $56,827. This is
based on Mr Schutz having no earnings during the period.
Vincents Report
report by Lance Kahler of Vincents dated 21 May 2025 has been considered. Mr
Kahler noted he had reviewed the report of Furzer
Crestani, and he had been
instructed that the claimant is entitled to statutory benefits for the period 30
November 2023 to 24 August
Kahler noted that he agreed with the approach of Furzer Crestani in respect of
their assessment of the claimant’s PAWE to
be $2,340.85.
respect of the claimant’s post-accident earnings, Mr Kahler relied on the
profit and loss statements provided by the claimant
for the period 7 December
2023 to 24 August 2024. He stated this period represents the claimant’s
trading results for all but
the first week of the period that he has been asked
to calculate.
on these results, Mr Kahler calculated the claimant’s actual post-accident
average weekly earnings as
07/12/23 to 31/03/24
01/04/24 to 30/06/24
01/07/24 to 24/08/24
Operating profit / (loss)
- reported depreciation
- notional depreciation
True net profit / (loss) before tax
Number of weeks in period
Average weekly earnings / (loss) for period
Notional depreciation per week
preparing the above table, Mr Kahler notes the following:
has used the same approach to assess the claimant’s post-accident earnings
as was used to assess the claimant’s PAWE
(i.e. start with the reported
operating profit of the business and make appropriate depreciation adjustments
where necessary).
notional depreciation amount calculated for each period is based on Furzer
Crestani’s assessment of annual notional depreciation
(i.e. $19,401)
converted a weekly amount (i.e. $373.10 per week).
claimant’s reported expenses for the three months ended 30 June 2024
included a reported depreciation expense of $16,030.
The list of assets supplied
by the claimant indicates that this amount was in fact an instant asset
write-off pursuant to the acquisition
of a Rabaud Wood Cleaner for $16,030 on 01
May 2024. Accordingly, Mr Kahler added this amount back to the reported trading
three months ended 30 June 2024. He notes that Furzer Crestani made a
similar adjustment in their assessment of the claimant’s
post-accident
earnings (see Schedule E of the Furzer Crestani report).
Mr Kahler’s opinion, the claimant’s actual post-accident earnings
during the period 7 December 2023 to 24 August 2024
average of $1,745.61 per week during the period 7 December 2023 to 31 March
for the period 1 April 2024 to 24 August 2024.
Kahler notes that Furzer Crestani determined a total net trading loss of $26,609
for the period from 26 August 2023 to 30 June
2024. Mr Kahler notes this is
calculated based on their assessment of the claimant’s true profit for the
year end 30 June 2024
(a loss of $11,031) and the claimant’s “true
profit” for the pre-accident period from 1 July 2023 to 25 August
profit of $15,578), rather than relying on the relevant periodic post-accident
profit and loss statements.
the post-accident profit and loss statements supplied by the claimant and making
appropriate adjustments for depreciation, Mr
Kahler estimates the
claimant’s earnings during the post-accident period from 26 August 2023 to
30 June 2024 as follows:
26/08/23 to 30/09/23
01/10/23 to 31/12/23
01/01/24 to 30/06/24

on the above, Mr Kahler assessed a net loss of $23,748 for the period 26 August
2023 to 30 June 2024. He noted that this is
not materially different to Furzer
Crestani’s assessment of a loss of $26,609.
significant proportion of the claimant’s overall trading loss for the
period were due to losses in the first entitlement period
(being 25 August 2023
to 25 November 2023), noting the losses incurred for the period from 26 August
2023 to 30 September 2023 ($10,232)
and the period 1 October 2023 to 31 December
2023 ($25,544).
respect of the period 30 November 2023 to 31 March 2024, Mr Kahler applied a
statutory benefit percentage of 85% as he assessed
a partial loss of earnings.
That is, $2,340.85 minus earnings of $1,745.61 x 85% = $505.95 x 17.57 = $8,890.
respect of the period 1 April 2024 to 24 August 2024, Mr Kahler referred to the
relevant wording of the MAI Act where it states
that statutory benefits payable
during the second entitlement period are the difference between the
person’s pre-accident earning
capacity (if any) or post-accident earnings,
whichever is the greater. Mr Kahler assumed post-accident weekly earnings of nil
this period, noting that while the claimant incurred losses, his
post-accident earning capacity cannot be less than zero. As this
was a total
loss of earnings, a benefit of 80% was applied, being $2,340.85 x 80% x 20.86 =
this totalled $47,954 ($8,890 + $39,064) and deducting Mr Schutz’s
payments received to date of $15,940, Mr Kahler calculated
an underpayment of
Kahler notes that he disagrees with Furzer Crestani’s opinion that the
claimant’s post-accident earnings for the entire
post-accident period are
nil, based on the claimant’s overall trading loss of $26,909 from the date
of the accident to 30 June
2024. The MAI Act specifically states that the second
entitlement period only considers the difference in earnings after the first
entitlement period. Furzer Crestani’s approach takes into account the
significant trading losses incurred by the claimant in
the first entitlement
period. Mr Kahler’s methodology is based on the claimant’s earnings
after the first entitlement
Mr Kahler opines that, where a self-employed claimant has produced periodic
post-accident trading results, it is appropriate
to calculate the
claimant’s post-accident earnings for relevant distinct periods, noting
the likely changes in post-accident
earnings as a claimant’s capacity for
works changes from time to time.
adopting post-accident earnings for the entire post-accident period based on an
assessment that includes the claimant’s trading
losses for the first
entitlement period, Mr Kahler opines that Furzer Crestani’s calculations
are not in accordance with the
MAI Act and overstate the amount of the
underpayment.
Kahler submits that his approach, which relies solely on the claimant’s
trading results during the relevant post-accident
periods, should be preferred.
CONSIDERATION
What is agreed?
the commencement of this matter in the Commission, the parties have
significantly narrowed the issues in dispute. It is agreed
as between the
parties that:
Schutz is an earner for the purposes of the MAI Act;
PAWE is $2,340.85;
Schutz is entitled to statutory benefits for up to 52 weeks post-accident. Any
entitlements beyond this period is not in issue
Schutz lodged his claim for statutory benefits more than three months after the
date of the motor accident to which the claim
relates, weekly payments of
statutory benefits are not payable in respect of any period before his claim was
Accordingly, Mr
Schutz’s relevant entitlement period is 30 November 2023 to 24 August
Schutz’s entitlement falls solely within s 3.7 of the MAI Act, being the
“second entitlement period”;
has been no determination of Mr Schutz’s post-accident earning capacity,
and the insurer concedes that Mr Schutz’s
post-accident earning capacity
is determined by his post-accident earnings;
Schutz’s business incurred losses for the period 1 April 2024 to 24 August
2024 and therefore his post-accident earnings
for this period are nil. As such,
Mr Schutz’s weekly payments of statutory benefits for 1 April 2024 to 24
August 2024 are
$2,340.85 x 80%, and
Schutz has been paid $15,939.96 in weekly payments of statutory benefits to

period 30 November 2023 to 31 March 2024 should be
calculated.
How should Mr Schutz’s post-accident earnings
for 30 November 2023 to 31 March 2024 be calculated?
sum, the insurer contends that s 3.7 of the MAI Act requires weekly payments of
statutory benefits to be calculated by reference
to any post-accident earnings
after the first entitlement period. Mr Schutz submits that this would be unfair
based on the nature
of how his business is structured, and that the calculation
should instead be based on his post-accident earnings for the entire
post-accident period.
resolution of this issue turns on how s 3.7 of the MAI Act should be construed.

point has been considered.

the text of the MAI Act, it is clear that sections 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 provide for
three separate entitlement periods. All
three entitlement periods provide for
different and specific methods of calculating a claimant’s entitlement to
weekly payments.
respect of the first entitlement period, prescribed as the “first 13 weeks
after motor accident”, payment is to be
at the rate of 95% of the
difference between the person’s pre-accident weekly earnings and the
person’s post-accident
earning capacity (if any) or post-accident
earnings, whichever is the greater, for the first entitlement
respect of the second entitlement period, prescribed as “weeks 14-78 after
motor accident”, payment is to be at the
rate of either 80% in the case of
a total loss of earnings, or 85% in the case of a partial loss of earnings, of
the difference between
the person’s pre-accident weekly earnings and the
person’s post-accident earning capacity (if any) or post-accident
whichever is the greater, after the first entitlement
respect of the third entitlement period, prescribed as the period “after
week 78”, payment is to be at the rate of
either 80% in the case of a
total loss of earning capacity, or 85% in the case of a partial loss of earning
capacity, of the difference
between the person’s pre-accident earning
capacity and the person’s post-accident earning capacity (if any) or
post-accident
earnings, whichever is the greater, after the second entitlement
is clear from the text of the legislation is that, in respect of the first and
second entitlement periods, a claimant’s
entitlement is calculated based
on the difference between their PAWE and their post-accident earning capacity
(if any) or post-accident
earnings. However, a claimant’s entitlement in
the third entitlement period is calculated based on their person’s
pre-accident
earning capacity, rather than their PAWE.
Additionally,
the wording of s 3.7 is very specific. It provides for weekly payments in the
second entitlement period to be calculated
based on the difference between the
person’s PAWE and post-accident earning capacity (if any) or post-accident
earnings, whichever
is the greater,
after the first entitlement period
(my emphasis). There is nothing that allows a discretion to base the
calculation of these payments on a broader period.
other periods of entitlement have similar prescriptions and require payments to
be calculated based on the person’s earnings
or earning capacity during
the specified period in which the payment is for.
3.23 provides that weekly payments are to be paid fortnightly, unless otherwise
provided by the Guidelines or agreed between
the parties. Section 3.15 provides
that a claimant’s fitness for work is to be evidenced by providing an
insurer with certificates
of fitness in respect of the period of which they are
entitled to weekly payments of statutory benefits. The certificate must, inter
alia, certify the person’s fitness for work not exceeding 28 days, unless
one of the specified exceptions applies.
3.19(5) provides that the notice requirements do not apply to a reduction in
weekly payments of statutory benefits as a result
of any change in an injured
person’s earnings from any employment.
sections support the above interpretation of s 3.7 and indicate that weekly
benefits in the second entitlement period should
be calculated on a sufficiently
regular basis to ensure they reflect the claimant’s current earnings
and/or earning capacity.
There is nothing that suggests the entitlement should
be calculated by reference to a financial year or a full year. I find that
approach would be contrary to not only the text of s 3.7 but also the text of
the MAI Act as a whole.
noted by Justice Adamson in
Allianz Australia Insurance v Jenkins
, “[i]n construing the Act, it is important to recall that the
purpose of the provisions referred to above is to provide compensation,
partial, for economic
in its context, and examining the purposes of the MAI Act, I can see no basis to
construe the text of the legislation in
any other manner.
find no basis for the claimant’s submission that weekly benefits in
respect of the second entitlement period should be calculated
claimant’s earnings for a full financial year. This claimant’s
submission was not based upon the legislative
text, context or purpose, but
rather on the basis of “unfairness” to Mr Schutz.
accept that a calculation of Mr Schutz’s weekly payments in the second
entitlement period by reference to only his earnings
after the first entitlement
period may result in a calculation that he considers to be “unfair”
based on his particular
circumstances. However, as noted above, I find there is
no basis for construing s 3.7 of the MAI Act to calculate his weekly payments
the second entitlement period on the basis of his full financial year earnings.
I also find there is no discretion provided to
enable me to amend the relevant
period in which his earnings are to be calculated on this basis.
Mr Schutz had complied with the relevant statutory timeframes in the MAI Act,
any losses in the first entitlement period would
have been considered in respect
of the calculation of his weekly payments of statutory benefits in the first
entitlement period.
Accordingly,
I find that Mr Kahler’s approach to the calculation of Mr Schutz’s
earnings during the second entitlement
period to be correct. There is no basis
in the legislation for the approach contended by Mr Katehos, being to examine
the full financial
year in circumstances where that includes the first
entitlement period.
also find Mr Kahler of Vincents has not “cherry picked” certain
periods in order to calculate Mr Schutz’s earnings.
Kahler’s approach is based on the specific legislative requirement for
weekly payments during the second entitlement
period to be calculated by
reference to earnings or earning capacity during that period.
completeness, I accept that there may be timing issues with the recording of
expenses and sales, as submitted by the claimant
and Mr Katehos. However, as
noted above, I am prevented from taking into account a broader period for the
purpose of calculating
Mr Schutz’s entitlement to weekly payments during
the second entitlement period. Mr Katehos’s suggested approach is not
permitted under the MAI Act.
What are Mr Schutz’s
post-accident earnings?
on my interpretation of the relevant sections of the MAI Act, I have found that
Mr Schutz’s weekly payments for 30 November
2023 to 24 August 2024 are to
be calculated based on the difference between his PAWE and his post-accident
the first entitlement period.
noted above, loss of earnings is defined in Sch 1 cl 3 of the MAI Act. This
requires the loss to be incurred or likely to be incurred
in a person’s
income from personal exertion. A person’s income from personal exertion
includes the proceeds of any business
carried on by the person either alone or
in partnership with any other
Accordingly, I agree
with the claimant’s submission that his earnings should be calculated
pursuant to subclause (2)(b).
note that the claimant relies on the interpretation of this section as set out
Insurance Australia Limited t/as NRMA Insurance v Iskander
NSWPICMRP 5
, which states that income from personal exertion, under the
MAI Act, refers to the claimant’s share of the proceeds of the
business. I
agree with this interpretation, however note that there is no allegation in the
current matter that any of the proceeds
of the claimant’s business are not
the earnings of the claimant as an earner.
is no evidence before me as to the structure of Mr Schutz’s business. Both
parties appear to have approached the calculation
of Mr Schutz’s earnings
on the basis that these are the earnings of his business. Accordingly, in the
absence of any submissions
on this point and based on the evidence before me, I
have approached my calculation of Mr Schutz’s earnings on this same basis.
the claimant is a self-employed small business owner, he does not draw a weekly
or fortnightly wage. Based on the evidence before
me, I find it is appropriate
to base the calculation of Mr Schutz’s post-accident earnings on his
business’s post-accident
profit and loss statements.
Schutz’s profit and loss statements are provided for various periods of
differing intervals. I have examined these statements
and they are extracted at
above. Relevantly, they
are for the following periods:
2023 to December 2023;
August 2023 to 31 March 2024;
2023 to March 2024;
December 2023 to 31 March 2024;
2024 to March 2024;
2024 to June 2024, and
July 2024 to 24 August 2024.
are profit and loss statements which precisely cover the period 7 December 2023
to 24 August 2024. This period represents the
claimant’s trading results
for all but the first week of the relevant post-accident period.
examining these statements, I have found the reports prepared by both Mr Katehos
and Mr Kahler to be of assistance. For the reasons
set out above, I accept Mr
Kahler’s approach to be aligned with the requirements of the legislation.
Kahler opines that it is appropriate to assess Mr Schutz’s post-accident
earnings by starting with the reported operating
profit of the business. I find
that it is appropriate to adopt Mr Kahler’s approach of using the
“reported operating
profit” rather than relying on the reported
“net profit / loss” in the business profit and loss statements. This
is because I find the “other income” listed, such as fuel tax
credits, flood recovery grants and insurance reimbursements,
do not constitute a
“loss of earnings” as they are not income from personal exertion. I
find these payments do not fall
within any of the categories in Sch 1 sub-cl
3(2) of the MAI Act.
I note that Mr Kahler’s calculations make notional depreciation
adjustments. Mr Kahler states that the amount for each
period was based on that
assessed by Mr Katehos ($19,401), converted to a weekly amount ($373.10). In the
circumstances where the
experts are aligned on this point, I accept this
calculation of notional depreciation and find it appropriate to apply notional
in calculating Mr Schutz’s post-accident earnings.
Katehos is critical of Mr Kahler for not amortising expenses such as public
liability insurance costs over the full year. In this
regard, I note public
liability insurance costs of $1,547.41 have been captured for the purposes of
determining Mr Schutz’s
earnings in the period April 2024 to June 2024. I
find this appropriate. There is no evidence before me as to the period in which
these costs were incurred.
Accordingly,
I find that Mr Schutz’s weekly payments of statutory benefits for the
period 7 December 2023 to 24 August 2024
should be calculated based on Mr
Schutz’s reported operating profit for this period, minus notional
depreciation.
Period 30 November 2023 to 6 December
accept Mr Katehos’s criticism of Vincents’ report that there is no
attempt to assess the claimant’s post-accident
earnings for the period 30
November 2023 to 6 December 2023.
note that the documents provided by both parties do not enable me to make a
precise determination of Mr Schutz’s post-accident
earnings for this
period. I find that the most appropriate method to calculate the
claimant’s earnings for the period 30 November
2023 to 6 December 2023 is
to examine the claimant’s profit and loss statement for the period October
2023 to December 2023,
and to take a pro-rata of this period.
profit and loss statement for the period October 2023 to December 2023 refers to
the operating profit being a loss of $20,640.64.
Accordingly, I find that Mr
Schutz’s income for this period was $nil.
find Mr Schutz had a total loss of earnings for the period 30 November 2023 to 6
December 2023 (inclusive) and the rate of 80% is
Accordingly,
Mr Schutz was entitled to a weekly payment of statutory benefits for the period
30 November 2023 to 6 December 2023 of
$2,340.85 (PAWE) x 80% (applicable rate)
= $1,872.68.
Period 7 December 2023 to 31 March
respect of the period 7 December 2023 to 31 March 2024, I find that Mr
Schutz’s post-accident earnings were $35,107 (based
on his reported
operating profit), minus notional depreciation of $6,182 ($373.10 x 16.57
weeks), resulting in a total net profit
of $28,925 for the period. This equates
to an average weekly earning of $1,745.62.
this reflects a partial loss of earnings, the rate of 85% is to be applied in
accordance with s 3.7(2)(b).
Accordingly,
Mr Schutz is entitled to weekly payments of statutory benefits in the period 7
December 2023 to 31 March 2024 in the
amount of $2,340.85 (PAWE) - $1,745.62
(average weekly earnings) x 85% (applicable rate) = $505.95.
Period 1 April 2024 to 24 August 2024
noted above, the parties agree that the profit and loss statements demonstrate
that Mr Schutz incurred losses for the period 1
April 2024 to 24 August 2024
inclusive. I find this is correct based on the documentation before me.
Accordingly,
the rate of 80% is to be applied as this is a total loss of
Schutz is entitled to weekly payments of statutory benefits in the period 1
April 2024 to 24 August 2024 in the amount of $2,340.85
(PAWE) x 80% (applicable
rate) = $1,872.68.
8 of the MAI Act regards costs and fees.
8.3 of the MAI Act provides for the fixing of maximum costs recoverable by
Australian legal practitioners, and relevantly
(4) An Australian legal practitioner is not entitled to be paid or recover
legal costs for any legal services provided to a party
to a claim for statutory
benefits (whether the claimant or the insurer) in connection with the claim
unless payment of those legal
costs is permitted by the regulations or the
Commission.”
8.10(1) provides:
“(1) A claimant for statutory benefits is
(subject to this section) entitled to recover from the insurer against whom the
is made the reasonable and necessary legal costs, and other costs and
expenses, incurred by the claimant in connection with the claim.
Other costs and
expenses include the cost of medical and other tests and reports.”
entitlement in s 8.10(1) is qualified by sub-sections (2) to (4). These
sub-sections provide:
“(2) The regulations may make
provision for or with respect to fixing the maximum costs and expenses
recoverable by a claimant
under this section (including any matters for which no
costs and expenses are recoverable from the insurer).
(3) A claimant for statutory benefits is only entitled to recover from the
insurer against whom the claim is made reasonable and
necessary legal costs
incurred by the claimant if payment of those costs is permitted by the
regulations or the Commission:
(4) The Commission can permit payment of legal costs incurred by a claimant
but only if satisfied that—
(b) exceptional circumstances exist that justify payment of legal costs
incurred by the claimant.”
2 of the Motor Accident Injuries Regulation 2017 (Regulations) pertains to
maximum legal and other costs.
this matter is not a regulated merit review matter under Sch 1 Part 1 cl 1 of
the Regulations, nor is the claimant under a legal
incapacity, legal costs are
only recoverable from the insurer if the Commission is satisfied that
exceptional circumstances exist
that justify such payment: s 8.10(4)(b).
7.13A of the MAI Act allows a merit reviewer to include in the certificate an
assessment of the claimant’s costs. In
making the assessment,
s 7.13A(3) provides that the merit reviewer must give effect to the
requirements of the Regulations under
Part 8 of the MAI Act and have regard to
the principles referred to in s 200 of the
Legal Profession Uniform Law
I have determined the substance of this matter in my capacity as a merit
reviewer pursuant to Sch 2 cl (1)(a) of the MAI Act,
and I am able to assess
costs in that capacity, a determination of exceptional circumstances must be
made by the Commission. Merit
reviewers do not constitute the
“Commission”.
However, noting that I am also appointed as a Member of the Commission, I
consider it is consistent with both the objects of the
PIC Act and the guiding
principle for me to determine the question of exceptional circumstances in this
matter in my capacity as
a Member, rather than require the parties to file a
separate application.
“Exceptional
circumstances” is accepted to mean circumstances that are unusual or out
of the ordinary, determined based
on the facts of the individual
The case does not need to
be one that is unique, unprecedented, or very
Exceptional
circumstances can include a single exceptional matter, a combination of
exceptional factors, or a combination of ordinary
factors which, although
individually of no particular significance, when taken together are seen as
exceptional.

particular circumstances of each
Schutz submits that exceptional circumstances exist and that he should be
entitled to recover his reasonable and necessary legal
costs incurred in
connection with this matter up to the regulated maximum, being 16 monetary
units. Mr Schutz points to the requirement
to obtain forensic accounting reports
to indicate the complexity associated with this matter. He says that the
insurer’s review
outcomes varied substantially, as did the analysis of the
financial records of his business. He further says that detailed submissions
were required to successfully explain and narrow the issues in dispute, in order
to bring the matter to a point where the Commission
was able to determine the
Schutz also seeks an order that the insurer pay the outstanding costs of the
Furzer Crestaini initial report in the amount of $2,662
and the supplementary
report in the amount of $2,640.00. The claimant submits that accountant fees are
not regulated per regulation
20(b) of the Regulations, and that these costs are
reasonable and necessary given the reliance placed on both reports.
insurer notes that it is a matter for the Commission as to whether it is
satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist such as
to justify payment of
legal costs incurred by the claimant in accordance with s 8.10(4) of the MAI
Act. In the event that the Commission
is satisfied that exceptional
circumstances exist, the insurer agrees that the amount claimed by Mr Schutz,
being 16 monetary units
and the costs of the Furzer Crestani reports, is
reasonable and necessary.
this matter did not require an assessment conference, it involved complex
forensic accounting evidence necessitating several
reports by forensic
accounting experts qualified by both the insurer and claimant. Over the course
of the proceedings, the parties
made several concessions which significantly
narrowed the issues in dispute. This is reflective of the complexity of the
issues involved
in this matter and the parties should be complimented on their
conduct throughout the proceedings.
substantial work undertaken by the claimant’s legal representatives was
apparent in their detailed submissions.
addition to the complexity of facts, this matter also involved areas of
statutory interpretation. It is this combination which
I consider makes it a
matter out of the ordinary.
Accordingly,
I find that exceptional circumstances exist such as to permit the claimant to
recover his legal costs up to the amount
proposed, being 16 monetary units. I
find that it is also appropriate to allow the costs of the Furzer Crestani
reports, being in
the amounts of $2,420 plus GST and $2,400 plus GST. The
claimant has provided invoices in support and I am satisfied that these costs
have been incurred for the purposes of the MAI
I also accept these
invoices are fees for accountant reports and are not costs regulated by Part 6
of the Regulations.
to s 8.10(4)(b) of the MAI Act, the Commission permits payment of legal costs
incurred by the claimant in connection with
this matter. Pursuant to s 7.13A of
the MAI Act, the claimant’s reasonable and necessary costs are assessed in
the amount of
16 monetary units.
costs of the reports of Furzer Crestani in the amounts of $2,420 plus GST and
$2,400 plus GST are reasonable and necessary.
reviewable decision is set aside.
substitution, I find that the claimant’s entitlement to weekly benefits
for the period 30 November 2023 to 24 August 2024
should be calculated on the
following basis:
claimant’s pre-accident weekly earnings are $2,340.85, and
claimant’s post-accident earnings are:
the period 30 November 2023 to 6 December 2023 (inclusive): $nil, being a total
loss of earnings for the purposes of s 3.7(2)(a);
the period 7 December 2023 to 31 March 2024 (inclusive): $1,745.62, being a
partial loss of earnings for the purposes of s 3.7(2)(b),
the period 1 April 2024 to 24 August 2024 (inclusive): $nil, being a total loss
of earnings for the purposes of s 3.7(2)(a).
insurer is to pay the claimant’s legal costs in the amount of 16 monetary
units and disbursements in the amount of $4,820

It is noted that there
seems to be a minor typographical error in the claimant’s calculations,
and the Commission calculates
$1,872.68 x 38.86 to be $72,772.34. Accordingly,
the amount said to be owed is calculated to be $72,772.34 - $15,939.96 =
$56,832.38.
The insurer’s
initial submissions dated 24 February 2025 referred to the period 7 December
2023 to 24 August 2024. However,
at the preliminary conference on 10 March 2025,
the parties confirmed that the relevant period was 30 November 2023 to 24 August
It is noted that the
profit in this period is reported to be positive. It is assumed Mr Katehos is
referring to the subsequent period
of 26 August 2023 to 6 December 2023.
It is noted that Mr Kahler
does not provide an opinion as to the claimant’s actual post-accident
earnings for the period 30
November 2023 to 6 December 2023 (inclusive).
Per s 6.13 of the MAI Act and
regulation 8A of the
Regulations.
It is noted that
some of the insurer’s documents reference the commencement date as 7
December 2023. At the preliminary conference
on 10 March 2025, the parties
confirmed the relevant period to be 30 November 2023 to 24 August 2024. This was
also confirmed by
the parties in their subsequent submissions.
