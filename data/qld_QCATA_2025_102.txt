APPEARANCES & REPRESENTATION:
This matter was heard and determined on the papers pursuant to
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2009
REASONS FOR DECISION
What is this application about?
Egan is the former tenant of Mr Stanley, who, by an application for minor civil
dispute – residential tenancy dispute
filed 21 June 2024 sought orders
claiming the bond held by the Residential Tenancies Authority for the tenancy as
well as compensation
for various claims arising from the condition in which Ms
Egan is alleged to have left the property when her tenancy ended.
September 2024, Ms Egan filed an application for leave to have her father, Mr
Egan, represent her in the tenancy proceedings.
He had, her application said,
represented her in the Residential Tenancies Authority dispute resolution
processes that preceded the
tenancy application being brought, was not a legal
practitioner and was present when the property was being exited.
decision made 26 September 2024, a Tribunal Adjudicator refused Ms Egan’s
application “to have legal representation
at the hearing” where no
such leave was sought. Ms Egan filed an application for leave to appeal and to
appeal that decision.
directions made 29 October 2024, the Appeal Tribunal advised the parties of its
intention to consider whether to grant leave
to appeal, allow the appeal, set
aside the decision and substitute it for a decision permitting Ms Egan leave to
be represented in
the proceeding by Mr Egan because:
(a) The decision the subject of the application for leave to appeal or appeal is
a decision by an Adjudicator to refuse Ms Egan “leave
to have legal
representation”.
(b) Ms Egan filed two applications for leave for Mr Egan to represent her in the
proceedings, both of which disclose, clearly, that
Mr Egan is not a legal
practitioner.
(c) The Tribunal appears to have erred in refusing the application for leave to
be represented under mistake as to Mr Egan’s
status as a layperson, as
opposed to a legal practitioner. It was an error to refuse Ms Egan leave for
legal representation that
she did not seek.
(d) Further, respectfully, having regard to the supporting information tendered
by Ms Egan,
the learned
Adjudicator’s decision to refuse leave to be non-legally represented went
against the weight of evidence that was
then before him having regard to
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2009
(QCAT Act).
(e) A decision permitting non-legal representation is an outcome that would
permit the minor civil dispute hearing in Q4432-24 to
proceed fairly and
expeditiously.
[5] Neither
party filed submissions in response to the invitation to do so contained in
those directions. Unfortunately, the file
was not referred to the Appeal
Tribunal for a decision until recently.
[6] By s 142(3)
of the QCAT Act, Ms Egan requires leave to appeal the decision. In determining
whether to grant leave, the Appeal
Tribunal must be satisfied that:
(a) there is a reasonably arguable case of error in the primary
(b) there is a reasonable prospect that the appellant will obtain substantive
(c) leave is need to correct a substantial injustice caused by some
(d) there is a question of general importance upon which further argument, and a
decision of the Appeal Tribunal, would be to the
[7] Although
there is a presumption in favour of an exercise of discretion, it is an error of
law for a decision-maker to make a decision
acting on a wrong principle, or that
is which is manifestly unreasonable because it failed to give adequate weight to
factor of great importance or gave excessive weight to extraneous
[8] Here, the
learned Adjudicator made a mistake as to fact, namely that Mr Egan was a legal
practitioner when he was not, and an
error of law by acting on a wrong
principle, by considering application as one for legal representation and by
failing to consider
appropriateness of a non-legal representative to represent
under s 43(4)(b) of the QCAT Act.
[9] By refusing
leave for legal representation, where the application before the Tribunal
(a) for leave to be represented by a non-lawyer, and
(b) supported by the history of Mr Egan’s involvement in the case
including pre-hearing dispute resolution procedures, and
(c) supported by evidence as to Ms Egan’s particular circumstances and
the Tribunal below has clearly erred.
[10] Leave to
appeal is granted because the decision refusing leave is infected by that error
and Ms Egan would suffer a substantial
injustice if leave to appeal were not
granted. The appeal is allowed, and the decision is set aside.
[11] Pursuant to
s 147 of the QCAT Act, as the appeal has been decided on a question of mixed law
and fact, upon a rehearing of the
application for leave to be represented, the
decision of the Appeal Tribunal is to grant Ms Egan leave to be represented in
the proceeding
by her father, Mr Egan.
[12] Although s
43 of the QCAT Act provides that parties will represent themselves unless the
interest of justice require otherwise,
the Tribunal is satisfied that the
circumstances of the dispute, Mr Egan’s involvement in it and Ms
Egan’s particular
needs are such that representation will assist Ms Egan
to properly respond to the application and will assist the tribunal to hear
matter with a vulnerable party properly represented. The Appeal Tribunal is
satisfied that Mr Stanley will not be disadvantaged
by granting Ms Egan leave to
be represented in those circumstances.
[13] The tenancy
dispute should proceed to final hearing as soon as possible on that basis and
directions are made accordingly.
Application for leave to
appeal or appeal filed 10 October 2024.
