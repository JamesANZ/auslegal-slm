REASONS FOR DECISION
(Delivered 31 March 2023)
MACDONALD LCJ
The Proceeding
Plaintiff commenced this proceeding by filing a statement of claim against the
Defendant for $84,475 plus interest and legal costs,
on 2 September
basis of the claim was that between 2013 and 2017 the Defendant misappropriated
a total sum of $84,475 from the Plaintiff's business.
The Defendant was
convicted and sentenced in the Supreme Court for the misappropriation on 5
December 2018. That was in relation
to 45 counts for contravention of s 210 and
s 227 of the
Criminal Code
(NT), generically described as 'deception' and
'stealing'.
sentencing on 5 December 2018 the Supreme Court also made a restitution order in
the sum for which judgement is sought, with the
restitution amount to be paid to
the Plaintiff within 5 years of date of sentence.
Defendant filed a notice of defence to the statement of claim on
8 October 2020. The defence included that a restitution order
in the Supreme Court criminal proceedings, and therefore she still had until
4 December 2023 to pay the restitution order,
so a stay was sought.
Additionally, that there was no interest or costs on the restitution order, so
the Plaintiff was not entitled
to that relief from the Local Court (the
matter came before the Court for hearing on 2 March 2021. The Plaintiff was
represented during the proceedings, and the Defendant
was unrepresented.
Following hearing from both parties, the matter was adjourned for the filing of
any written submissions by both
Plaintiff filed further written submissions on 9 March 2021, largely in relation
to interest and costs.
Defendant filed written submissions on 23 March 2021. Those submissions included
that a stay should be granted until five years
from the original restitution
order of the Supreme Court. She does not admit that she stole the money, but
accepts that she 'lost
the trial'. If she could pay the amount she would, but
believes if given time, she would be able to raise the funds by December

Defendant also submitted that decision in

should prevent the judgment sought.
each of those decisions concern the use or imposition of imprisonment when
restitution is not paid in orders related to criminal
proceedings. These
proceedings are not an application under the
Sentencing Act 1995
payment and enforcement of the restitution order.
24 March 2021, I heard final submissions from both parties and adjourned the
matter for decision. The evidence included tender
of the relevant Certificate of
Conviction dated 14 July 2020 and a transcript of the sentencing proceedings in
SCC 21720023 before
his Honour Justice Graham on 5 December
. At that time the restitution
order was also made, with a five-year period for payment
prescribed.
restitution order was part and parcel of sentence in criminal proceedings,
whereas the Plaintiff's claim is in the civil jurisdiction
of the Local Court.
Local Court Act 2015
establishes the court as a "court
of law and equity",
such that the court has broad civil jurisdiction.
Section 13(2)
of that Act makes clear that the court is empowered to grant
"equitable relief within its jurisdictional limit",
Supreme Court Act 1979
Most relevantly,
of the Act also confers jurisdiction on the court to "to
deal with a
claim for an amount
money if ... the amount is claimed as damages, a
debt or a liquidated demand"
(emphasis added), within its jurisdictional
is noted that the statement of claim alleges various facts essentially described
as 'misappropriation', but does not expressly
plead any usual cause of action at
common law or in equity, such as breach of contract in employment, debt due and
payable, breach
of fiduciary duty or the like.
that it appears the Defendant continues to not admit her criminal guilt in
relation to the money, she accepts the decision
of the Supreme Court, including
the restitution order. The restitution order was not by consent, but was not the
subject of any appeal
to the NT Court of Criminal Appeal. It is not my
conclusion that the restitution order produces a result such as
res judicata,
or that the restitution order could simply be converted to a civil
judgement, including due to enforcement being in the jurisdiction
of the Supreme
Court. However, I consider the amount sought by the proceeding is owed by the
Defendant to the Plaintiff, regardless
of whether characterized simply as
misappropriation, or as a breach of fiduciary duty, or a breach of employment
contract, or some
other proper cause.
is clear that the Plaintiff is generally entitled to bring the proceedings,
separate to any restitution order made by the Supreme
Court as a result of the
criminal proceedings.
Sentencing Act 1995
97 Orders not to affect other rights
Nothing in this Division affects the right of a person to bring and
maintain a civil action
that anything done or paid under an order
made under this Division must be taken into account in any award of
all the circumstances, including having regard to the evidence tendered at
hearing, I am satisfied on the balance of probability
that the Defendant is
civilly liable to the Plaintiff in the sum of $84,475 as sought by the
proceeding. I therefore order that the
Defendant pay to the Plaintiff that
amount, less any amount that she has paid to the Fines Recovery Unit for payment
to Rob Sheppard
Tiling Pty Ltd.
issues concerning interest and costs are to be determined. In relation to
interest, I accept the submissions of the Plaintiff,
in that, the ability to do
so is covered expressly in
Local Court (Civil Jurisdiction)
which provides;

considers appropriate on the whole or a part of the sum for the whole or a part

also agree with the submission that the Court has a discretion to allow
pre‑judgment interest and that it should be at a fair
and reasonable rate.
cited by the Plaintiff, his Honour Justice
Mildren held it is
plaintiff to call evidence about
relevant commercial interest
rates... [and]
absence of such
practice is to apply the rates from time to time applicable
to post judgement
accept where there is no evidence as to pre-judgment interest rates, post
judgement interest rates can be used. Here the Plaintiff
is applying for and
prepared to accept half the rate that would be applicable should a calculation
be done using 6 per cent above
the Reserve Bank cash rate. That is 3.05 per cent
from the date of last offending.
find there is no reason not to allow interest and costs of these proceedings in
relation to the amount owed.
is appropriate for interest to be 3.05 per cent. Whilst this amount was
calculated to be $12,902.85 at the time of submissions,
it would now be a larger
amount, and I rely on the Plaintiff for a new calculation, less any amount
already paid through the Fines
Recovery Unit.
I will hear the
parties as to costs.
The Orders are:

already paid of the restitution order of the Supreme
at a rate of 3.05 per cent of this amount from the date of last offending
contained in Exhibit 2.
