Holiday Park
RESIDENT Tabatha Brackstone
On the 18 January 2008 the resident Ms Brackstone entered into an agreement
with Bruce L’Green to purchase a caravan, annex,
shed and contents
situated at Site 39 Aldinga Beach Holiday Park Caravan Park in the State of
South Australia. The said agreement
did not include a right to occupy site 39
through an assignment of lease or the like, but rather contained the following
“10. The agreement is subject to and conditional upon the purchaser
receiving approval from the Aldinga Beach Holiday Park Caravan
Park for the
caravan, annex, shed and contents to remain on the existing site, prior to the
date of settlement. The purchaser shall
be responsible for all costs associated
with the granting of the approval by the Aldinga Beach Holiday Park Caravan
vendor and the purchaser covenant with each other that each will as when and
required by the other party execute all such further
assignments, transfers,
covenants and assurances and all such other Acts matters all things shall be
reasonably necessary for the
purpose of affecting settlement in the terms
In an effort to obtain the approval of the Aldinga Beach Holiday
Park for the continued occupancy of site 39 Ms Brackstone emailed
owners. The first email being sent on Monday 14 January 2008 at 5.34pm stating
as follows:
“Hi Paul and Jenny.
I’m Tabatha, I am currently negotiating a purchase deal for lot 39.
Could you please confirm how much the yearly lease is ?, is it included in
the weekly rental of $90?
How much is the refundable bond?
Do you anticipate any problems with me continuing the lease next year?
Any other information that I should know about would be appreciated.
Thanks, Tabatha.”
A subsequent email was forwarded by Ms Brackstone on Tuesday 15 January 2008
at 10.08am stating as follows:
I am an Aussie currently living in New Zealand, was looking to purchase lot
39 before the move, was told that I needed to pass a police
report but was told
nothing about having to meet with you in person.
I’m starting to feel a little frustrated as no one seems to be
answering my question which is how much is the yearly lease on
Or is the lease included in the weekly rental which the real estate agent has
told me will $90 a week for a single with 2 children,
plus $5 a week for own
washing machine, plus electricity.
The real estate agent has advised me to ask you these questions as he
doesn’t seem to have the answers himself.
If the purchase of lot 39 was to go through, and the lease was not renewed
after 12 months, would the owners only options be to sell
up which is what is
happening now, and/or could the owner relocate the caravan/dwelling.
Are you the owner of the caravan/dwelling at lot 39 or is it someone else,
just trying to find out who I’m actually trying to
purchase this
A response to this email was sent by Jenny Deppeler on 15 January 2008 at
We own the park not the van, van owned by elderly man who has moved in with
his lady friend he apparently lived here for many years.
We bought the park 18 months ago & have no plans of doing anything
different with the park.
Lease of the site is no fee no agreements just abide by all rules & regs
& we don’t have any problems well that’s
But you need to read a form J from the tenancy board I told the guy the web
site for that.
That set out everything for both parties.
before they move into the park. We are reasonable people
and will except most
people but if we are not happy will ask you to leave. I think that is about all
I can say at the moment give
us a call if you wish to talk further as its easier
to get the feel over the ph than thru an email.
Regards Jenny

A response was subsequently sent by Ms Brackstone on 17 January 2008 at
The Tribunal finds that the information contained in the email correspondence
between Ms Brackstone and Ms Deppeler of the Aldinga
Beach Holiday Park
confirmed the details of the verbal agreement between by the parties in respect
of occupancy of site 39 by Ms
Brackstone.
The Residential Parks Act (“the Act”) came into operation on 5
November 2007. Section 5(1) of the Act specifically provides
that the Act does
not apply to an agreement that can confer on a person or right to occupy a
dwelling in a residential park unless
the dwelling is to be the persons
principal place of residence. It is the evidence of Ms Brackstone that site 39
at the Aldinga
Beach Holiday Park is her principle place of residence. I find
therefore that the caravan and attached annex is a dwelling for the
purposes of
the Residential Parks Act and the
principal place of
The park owners gave evidence that whilst they were aware of the existence of
the new Residential Parks Act at the time they entered
into the agreement with
the resident they did not realise that their agreement was to be in writing in
order to comply with Section
10 of the said Act. The Tribunal will excuse their
non-compliance and give effect to their intention to enter into a valid
agreement. Hence the Tribunal finds that there is a Residential
Agreement on the abovementioned terms which is subject to the
Residential Parks Act 2007
application to the Tribunal seeks a declaration
that the current rent/site fee which the
agreed to pay, namely
$90.00 per week, is excessive. Based on the information provided to the
Tribunal and in particular the emails
presented which confirm the
was well aware of the site fee being $90.00 per week, the
Tribunal finds that it has no power under the
Residential Parks Act
to make such
a declaration in respect of excessive rent. This is clearly to be distinguished
from the situation envisaged under
of the Act where the Tribunal has
the power, upon the application of the resident within 30 days of receipt of a
notice of rent increase,
to declare that the proposed increase of rent is
excessive. In this instant there was no notice of rent increase. The
negotiated directly with the park owners and agreed to the site
fee of $90.00 per week. The Tribunal has no right under the Act
declare the rent excessive in these circumstances. Consequently the application
will be dismissed.
Application dismissed.
