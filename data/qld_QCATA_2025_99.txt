APPEARANCES & REPRESENTATION:
This matter was heard and determined on the papers pursuant to
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
REASONS FOR DECISION
make an order that the Appeal Tribunal record is amended to reflect the correct
spelling of the Second Respondent as Valma Ruth
[2] On 5 August
2025 the applicants Ian May and Valma Dunstan were ordered to prune certain
bamboo so that it is no taller than 2.5
metres from the base of the bamboo on or
before 1 November 2025. Other orders were made in relation to regular
maintenance and for
the tree owners to meet the cost incurred by the neighbour
for the pruning work in the circumstance that the work is not undertaken
tree owners.
[3] Mr May and
Ms Dunstan have filed an application for leave to appeal or appeal and an
application to stay the decision pending
the appeal.
[4] Both parties
have filed submissions in the stay application.
[5] In order to
obtain a stay of a decision an applicant must show a reasonably arguable case on
the appeal, that the applicant would
be materially disadvantaged without a stay
and that the balance of convenience favours a
[6] It is also
relevant to consider the nature of the grounds of appeal raised, whether it is
reasonably arguable that leave to appeal
might be granted and in the case of
questions of law alone whether the alleged errors are reasonably arguable on
[7] Mr May and
Ms Dunstan have raised grounds of appeal discussed below. Insofar as they have
raised questions of fact or mixed law
and fact, leave to appeal is required. The
usual considerations as to whether leave to appeal should be granted include
reasonably arguable case on appeal is shown, that is, there is an
error to be corrected. Beyond that the Appeal Tribunal considers
appeal is necessary to correct a substantial injustice, that is, whether a
different and more favourable result would
have been achieved if not for the
and whether an important
point of principle sufficient to warrant the grant of leave has been
identified.
[8] Where leave
to appeal is required, the Appeal Tribunal may grant a stay under
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
(‘QCAT Act’).
questions of law alone are raised leave to appeal is not required and the stay
is determined by reference to such a question
under s 145 of the QCAT Act.
assessing whether the grounds of appeal are reasonably arguable, no findings are
made and a preliminary assessment only is
undertaken.
Consideration
is a starting point in any stay application that a successful party is entitled
to the fruits of the litigation, and that
an order of the Tribunal is not
provisional pending an appeal.
Balancing those considerations is that a stay should be ordered where the appeal
would be rendered nugatory without a stay.
Reasonably arguable grounds
May and Ms Dunstan raise eight grounds of appeal.
[13] The errors
of law are said to be:
(a) Failing to take into account wind protection as a relevant consideration for
the purpose of
Neighbourhood Disputes (Dividing Fences and
Trees) Act 2011
(Qld) (‘the Act’). This ground is coupled with
an alleged error of fact in the Member finding Mr May and Ms Dunstan did
raise wind protection.
(b) Taking into account an irrelevant consideration, namely the view from the
pergola for the purpose of
of the Act and for determining the height to
which the bamboo should be pruned. Noting that this error is said to arise from
error of law and fact as to whether the pergola is a dwelling.
(c) Applying the wrong test; and/or failing to take a relevant consideration
into account in failing to make any or any proper finding
as to the view that
existed from the respondent’s dwelling when she took possession of the
(d) Finding, on no evidence, that bamboo is considered by many experts and local
authorities as a pest or weed and finding it is
not indigenous to Stradbroke
(e) Not applying
of the Act or taking an irrelevant consideration
into account in finding that the applicants could achieve privacy using other
such as internal and/or external blinds, awnings or screens.
(f) Not applying
of the Act and/or taking into account an irrelevant
consideration when finding that the bamboo is unattractive and does not add to
the landscaping or garden design.
(g) Failing to take into account a relevant consideration, namely the
applicants’ submissions as to how regularly pruning should
take place.
[14] In relation
to the alleged errors of law in failing to apply
(a) It is true that the Member mistakenly said that Mr May and Ms Dunstan did
not raise wind protection as a reason why it is important
to retain the bamboo.
Wind protection is raised in paragraph 36 to the statement of evidence of the
applicants.
(b) The Member’s obligation under
of the Act is to
“consider” the matters set out in the section by way of balancing
the interests of the parties. The
obligation is only to consider, that is to
think about or turn his mind to the matters in the section, it is not necessary
a finding about any of the
Section 73(1)(g)
Act requires the Member to consider any contribution the bamboo makes to the
amenity of the land on which it is situated.
(c) The evidence about wind protection overlooked by the Member was given as an
adjunct to more extensive submissions in relation
to the privacy afforded by the
bamboo, which is said to be the reason for planting the bamboo. No supporting
evidence is offered
in relation to the bamboo as a wind break.
(d) Although error might be demonstrated it is necessary for the asserted error
to be material in the sense that a different outcome
would have been reached if
the error did not occur.
think that the determination as to whether the bamboo substantially interfered
with Ms Heywood’s view, would have
been different if the Member had noted
the comment as to wind protection given the limited evidence and apparent
limited importance
of the issue. It is unlikely that this ground of appeal would
succeed, because the error is not material.
(e) Mr May and Ms Dunstan say that it was a misapplication of
Act to find there were other means to achieve privacy; and/or that an irrelevant
consideration was taken into account. The
statement made by the Member was an
observation rather than a finding. It was made in the course of considering the
amenity of the
land. The observation is consistent with a consideration of the
amenity of the land. I do not think the observation as to alternative
achieving privacy means that an irrelevant consideration has been taken into
account when merely giving consideration to
a matter. I do not consider that
there has been a misapplication of the Act. Privacy has been considered by the
Member in weighing
up the appropriate order. Apart from his observations as to
alternative means of achieving privacy the Member goes on to conclude
pruned to a height of 2.5 metres a level of privacy could be afforded to Mr May
and Ms Dunstan’s dwelling. For these
reasons I do not consider the ground
of appeal is likely to succeed.
(f) Mr May and Ms Dunstan say that it was a misapplication of
irrelevant consideration to find that the bamboo is unattractive and does not
add to landscaping or garden design. The statement
made by the Member was an
observation rather than a finding. It was made in the course of considering the
amenity of the land. The
observation is consistent with a consideration of the
amenity of the land, noting that the Member had photographs of the bamboo before
him.I do not consider an error of law has occurred or that an irrelevant
consideration was taken into account. But in any event the
ground of appeal is
unlikely to succeed because any error with respect to this matter is not
material to the decision. Mr May and
Ms Dunstan did not advance the
attractiveness of the current state of the bamboo as a reason why it should be
retained in its current
form from a landscaping or garden design perspective.
[15] As to an
alleged finding on no evidence that bamboo is considered by many experts as a
pest or weed, and is not indigenous to
Stradbroke Island, I consider the
statement made by the Member is an observation not a finding. It arises as part
of a consideration
and (e) of the Act, so that no finding is
necessary. The observation is in any event supported by evidence before the
Tribunal in
a Courier-Mail newspaper article addressing the problems caused by
bamboo in general. The Member particularly noted the height the
question had reached up to 6 metres, extends 10 metres along the common boundary
and that the base is more than 2 to 3
metres. These features are all outside the
evidence as to what might be anticipated for the species of bamboo in question.
of appeal is unlikely to succeed.
pruning, the member has noted that Mr May and Ms Dunstan are prepared to prune
the bamboo,
but have not done so. Their evidence is that they are
prepared to prune frequently, and they submit that was not taken into account.
In the end the Member ordered pruning to a height of 2.5 metres to be regularly
maintained. This ground of appeal is unlikely to
succeed, because the order made
is consistent with the evidence of Mr May and Ms Dunstan’s stated
intentions. The ground of
appeal is not material to the outcome.
question of whether Ms Heywood’s pergola is caught as a dwelling by
66(3)(b)(ii)
is of more importance. I consider it was open to the Member to find
that the pergola is part of the main dwelling because it is physically
by water, electricity and drainage and is used for entertainment, eating and
relaxation. Mr May and Ms Dunstan assert that
it was an error not to make a
finding that the pergola was a shelter such as a house in which people live. On
the Member’s
reasoning such a finding was not necessary because he found
the pergola was part of the main house (which is plainly a dwelling).
made his finding on evidence before him, accordingly that finding of mixed fact
and law is unlikely to be set aside on
[18] If the
Member was not in error to find that the pergola was part of the dwelling, it is
unlikely Mr May and Ms Dunstan will succeed
in in establishing an error of law
by taking an irrelevant consideration into account, in considering the view that
exists and existed
from the pergola for the purpose of
of the Act, and for
the purpose of determining the height to which the bamboo should be pruned.
[19] If I am
wrong about the likely outcome of this ground of appeal, I note that the Member
did not limit his findings as to obstruction
of the view, to a view from the
pergola. He relied on evidence before him to find obstruction of the view from
the main dwelling.
That was a finding open to him on the evidence and is
unlikely to be overturned by an appeal tribunal.
[20] Finally, it
is said that the Tribunal erred in law by applying a wrong test and/or taking an
irrelevant consideration into account,
in failing to make any, or any proper
finding as to the view that existed from Ms Heywood’s dwelling when she
took possession
of the land. The ground of appeal is unlikely to succeed because
of the findings made in the reasons for decision at paragraph [34]
in relation
to the view from the pergola in 2015, paragraph [41] noting that the bamboo was
planted after Ms Heywood purchased her
lot in 2015, and paragraphs [36], [37]
and [38] that the bamboo impacts the views from windows 1,2,3, other living
areas in the upstairs
part of Ms Heywood’s dwelling, and from the
preliminary assessment Mr May and Ms Dunstan have not shown a reasonably
arguable case of error. It is unlikely that leave
to appeal would be granted in
this matter or that the grounds raising an error of law would succeed on appeal.
[22] Further to
that point no substantial injustice appears to be demonstrated, and no important
question is raised by the appeal.
Balance of convenience
to the balance of convenience it is true that compliance with the order will
mean lowering the height of the bamboo and that
some cost will be incurred. If
Mr May and Ms Dunstan were to succeed in the application for leave to appeal or
appeal the issue of
cost incurred can be addressed. As to the height of the
bamboo, it is most likely that the bamboo will grow. No-one suggests that
does not re-grow if pruned. Mr May and Ms Dunstan will not have suffered an
irredeemable prejudice or a material disadvantage
if a stay is not granted.
[24] Ms Heywood
rejects the submission by Mr May and Ms Dunstan that she should put up with any
interference to her view because the
bamboo has been in place for years. She
notes two adjournments at the request of Mr May and Ms Dunstan have caused delay
matter has been ongoing since February 2022. Over time the obstruction
of her views caused by the bamboo has become worse. Ms Heywood
says that a stay
will delay an outcome whilst she continues to lose views and the enjoyment of
her property. She says that she is
affected more than the respondents if a stay
is granted.
[25] I accept Ms
Heywood’s submissions. Ms Heywood is entitled to the benefit of the orders
made in her favour to ameliorate
what has been found to be a substantial,
ongoing and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of her land.
That relief
should not be delayed on the basis of unmeritorious grounds of
application to stay a decision is refused.
