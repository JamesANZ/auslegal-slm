BREACH OF RULE
APPEARANCES
: Mr Stuart Bale, Solicitor of AW Bale &
Son appeared on behalf of the Appellant.
Mr Norm Torpey, Chairman of
Stewards, appeared on behalf of the Respondent.
REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr Leo Williams AO - Chairman
The Hon Sir James Killen - Deputy
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
This is an appeal by Mr
Stephen Robert Skilton against the finding and penalty imposed by the Queensland
Harness Racing Board Stewards
that he was in breach of Rule 209 of the Rules of
Harness Racing which provides:
“A person employed, engaged or
participating in the harness racing industry shall not knowingly furnish false
information to
the Controlling Body, the stewards or anyone
The penalty imposed on Mr Skilton was a suspension of his
Stablehand Licence for the remainder of the season which is to the end of
The matter concerns Mr Skilton completing an application for
Stablehand Licence form dated 15 November 2002 and in particular the
of the question:
“Have you ever been convicted of an offence in
any Court of Law?”
The form provides the marking of either Yes or
No with the added requirement of “If yes, provide
The form was completed by Mr Skilton by marking the
On 14 January 2003 a Stewards inquiry was convened after the
Registrar of the Queensland Harness Racing Board brought to the attention
Stewards that Mr Skilton has a criminal conviction. It was stated in the
transcript that the Registrar does random checks
on licences. Mr Skilton was
called to advise the Stewards in relation to the completion of the form and why
he did not advise of
past criminal convictions.
At the inquiry the
Stewards had details of Mr Skilton’s police record which was provided by
the Queensland Police Service and
this was presented to Mr Skilton. Mr Skilton
stated that although he appeared in Court he understood that none of his
convictions
had been recorded. He was consistent and adamant in that regard and
the inquiry was adjourned pending Mr Skilton being able to contact
his solicitor
to inquire as to whether there were convictions recorded against him.
inquiry resumed on 28 January 2003 and as is recorded on page 10 line 7 Mr
Skilton advised the Stewards:
“MR SKILTON: No. I have been in
looked through
my record - my file that he’s got and he said that I had a
conviction recorded.”
Further on in the inquiry it is recorded at
page 11 line 28 that Mr Skilton stated when asked by the Chairman of the
Stewards Panel,
is there anything else you want to state before the Stewards
decide on the matter, the following:
“MR SKILTON: No. But I
really didn’t think I had a conviction recorded. After leaving here on
Tuesday week ago, I’ve
been in contact with my solicitor and he looked up
my file and he said that, yes, I did have ...”.
Mr Skilton was
charged with a breach of Rule 209 and when advised by the Chairman of the
Stewards Panel whether there was anything
he wanted to say in relation to the
charge Mr Skilton stated at page 12 line 31:
“MR SKILTON: I plead
guilty because I do - my solicitor said I have a conviction.”
Notice of Appeal filed in this matter was against both the finding of the
Stewards and penalty. As this appeal proceeded by way
of re-hearing the
Authority sets aside the guilty plea given at the Stewards inquiry.
the hearing before the Authority Mr Bale submitted that the finding of a breach
of Rule 209 cannot be sustained because Mr Skilton
believed that he did not have
any convictions recorded. Mr Bale submitted that the wording of Rule 209 is
such that there has to
be shown by the Stewards that Mr Skilton knowingly
answered the form incorrectly and this simply can’t be shown on the
Mr Bale stated the Appellant had an honest and reasonable but
mistaken belief and as such it is an absolute defence to a breach
of Rule 209.
Mr Torpey did present to the Authority Mr Skilton’s police record
and while there is reference to a charge where there is no
conviction recorded
there is also reference to charges where Mr Skilton was charged with another
person where he was convicted and
a fine imposed.
It is clear from the
wording of Rule 209 that for there to be a breach some intention to furnish
false information must be shown.
Mere inadvertence would not constitute a
breach of Rule 209. The question which concerns the Authority is that while it
that Mr Skilton did not think a conviction was recorded against him
whether it’s a matter which he ought to have known. In
effect whilst his
belief may have been honest was it reasonable.
Mr Bale stated that he was
the solicitor who represented Mr Skilton at the Court appearances. Mr Bale
further stated that when he
was contacted by him after the first day of the
Stewards inquiry after looking at Mr Skilton’s file he advised him that a
was recorded.
While it appears surprising Mr Skilton did not
understand what happened at the Court appearance when the conviction was
recorded or
receive documents confirming his conviction, his strenuous denials
at the first day of the inquiry and the fact of contacting the
solicitor and
making enquiries appeared that this is in fact the position.
Authority believes that it is appropriate to also refer to the wording of the
question on the Application form referring to conviction.
It may well be more
appropriate that when reviewing the Application form that the appropriate
wording of the question be “Have
you ever been charged with an offence and
appeared in any Court of Law?” A person should know if they have appeared
charged with an offence and it would be extremely unlikely that any
incorrect answer to that question could in any way be considered
reasonable.
With respect to the circumstances of this matter it is
considered for there to be a breach under Rule 209 more must be shown with
regard to the intention of the Appellant to provide false
information.
The appeal is therefore allowed and the appeal deposit fee
is to be refunded to the Appellant.
