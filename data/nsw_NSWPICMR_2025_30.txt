STATEMENT OF REASONS
Elkhoury was involved in an accident on 12 May 2024. There was an apparent
high-speed collision between two other cars and one
of them rolled on top of the
claimant’s vehicle. The claimant was trapped in his vehicle and sustained
injuries including a
fractured right leg.
Elkhoury made a claim for statutory benefits under the
Motor Accident
Injuries Act 2017
(the MAI Act). The claim was made against QBE Insurance
(Australia) Limited (QBE), and QBE has accepted the claim and has paid Mr
Elkhoury his statutory benefits.
dispute arose between Mr Elkhoury and QBE about certain treatment and care
benefits. Mr Elkhoury lodged an application with the
Personal Injury Commission
(Commission) seeking a medical assessment of whether the following treatments
were related to the injuries
sustained in the accident and were reasonable and
necessary in the circumstances:
(a) a motorised mobility scooter, not yet purchased, and
(b) the reimbursement of travel expenses in the sum of $900 already incurred.
submissions lodged by the parties suggested that the sum of $900 was claimed for
two journeys:
(a) on 3 May 2025 the sum of $400 to transport the claimant from home to a
shopping centre (including waiting time) to address an
issue concerning his
broadband, to attend Service NSW and to visit other shops, and
(b) on 4 May 2025 the sum of $500 to bring his mother from her home in Wetherill
Park to his home (and return) to assist with house
insurer agreed to reimburse the 4 May 2025 expense “in good faith”
but declined to pay the 3 May 2025 expense on the
basis it was not reasonable
and necessary and not related to the accident.
matter was referred to me because it was not clear to the Commission what was in
dispute and whether there was a medical dispute
services or a merit review matter about the issue of the cost of those
STATUTORY FRAMEWORK
benefits payable by the “relevant insurer” in accordance with Part 3
of the MAI Act include:
(a) weekly loss of income benefits for “earners” under Division 3.3,
(b) treatment and care benefits under Division 3.4.
3.24(1), which is in Division 3.3 establishes the entitlement to these benefits
as follows:
“An injured person is entitled to statutory
benefits for the following expenses (treatment and care expenses) incurred in
with providing treatment and care for the injured person -
(a) the reasonable cost of treatment and care,
(b) reasonable and necessary travel and accommodation expenses incurred by the
injured person in order to obtain treatment and care
(c) if the injured person is under the age of 18 years or otherwise requires
assistance to travel for treatment and care, reasonable
and necessary travel and
accommodation expenses incurred by a parent or other carer of the injured person
are a number of limits and restrictions to what can be claimed by way of
treatment and care benefits starting with s 3.24(2):
statutory benefits are payable for the cost of treatment and care to the extent
that the treatment and care concerned was
not reasonable and necessary in the
circumstances or did not relate to the injury resulting from the motor accident
concerned.”
2 of the MAI Act recognises 47 different dispute types and declares some to be
Merit Review matters, others to be medical
assessment matters and others to be
Miscellaneous Claims Assessment matters. Relevantly to the subject matter of the
current proceedings:
(a) clause 1(i) declares the following to be a merit review matter –
“whether the cost of treatment and care provided
or to be provided to the
claimant is reasonable for the purposes of section 3.24(1)”, and
(a) clause 2(b) declares the following to be a medical assessment matter -
“whether any treatment and care provided or to be
provided to the injured
person is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances or relates to the injury
caused by the motor accident
for the purposes of section 3.24.”
PRELIMINARY CONFERENCE DISCUSSIONS
to the amount in dispute ($400), the costs available in a medical assessment
matter (currently a little over $2,000) and that
no costs are available to
either party in a merit review matter, the parties were advised at the
preliminary conference that the
aim was to resolve the dispute proportionately
and quickly.
discussions, Ms Bullus agreed that the claimant required transport assistance to
get to and from treatment and social outings
at the time the disputed expense
was incurred. The parties agreed that the dispute about the $400 taxi fare was
not therefore a medical
dispute and did not need to be referred for medical
assessment. It was further agreed that the dispute was about whether the cost
the transport assistance (the single $400 taxi expense) was reasonable and that
is a Merit Review matter which would be determined
as a Merit Review matter in
accordance with Schedule 2(1)(i).
Bullus raised issues about the “reasonableness” of the $400 expense
indicating relevant matters would include where
the claimant had travelled to,
the distance travelled, and the waiting time involved (and why two separate
trips could not have been
arranged). A “google search” performed
during the course of the discussions with the parties suggested that the taxi
fare from the claimant’s home at the time to Mt Druitt shopping centre was
only 2 km and would cost in the order of $10.
to the sum involved, no formal preliminary conference report was issued and a
statutory declaration or statement from the claimant
was not requested. The
claimant’s solicitor was directed to obtain instructions from her client
and to advise the insurer and
the Commission by way of a message in the portal
and a date was set for the delivery of reasons.
29 September 2025 the claimant uploaded a message to the portal
(a) on 3 May 2025 at 9.00am the claimant was collected from his home and taken
to Ms Druitt shopping centre;
(b) he was there for 3.5 hours and was taken home at about 1.00pm;
(c) the sum of $400 comprised the fee charged for the transport to and from the
shopping centre and the assistance provided by the
taxi driver while the
claimant was at the shopping centre;
(d) the claimant was mobilising using a wheelchair and the taxi driver
accompanied the claimant and wheeled him to different shops
and offices for the
duration of the 3.5 hour visit, and
(e) due to the state of his injuries, the claimant could not make this trip on
his own and required the assistance that he paid for.
insurer responded on 29 September 2025 advising that there appeared now to be a
medical dispute because what was previously identified
as the taxi
driver’s “waiting time” was now active assistance from that
taxi driver. The insurer disputed that
“any form of accompaniment or
assistance with ambulation is reasonable and necessary” because the
claimant’s treatment
providers were at that time “actively promoting
his independence with travel and mobility”. The insurer also took issue
with the taxi driver performing the service as he was not an
“appropriately qualified provider.”
message was sent to the parties which advised them that there did not appear to
be a medical dispute about the transport services
provided by the taxi driver in
travelling to and from the shopping centre, but there is now a medical dispute
the claimant to be accompanied and "wheeled" around the
shopping centre for 3.5 hours by the taxi driver. I noted that the medical
examination with the Medical Assessor (about the motorized wheelchair) was
scheduled for early December. In the light of the information
provided by the
claimant, I proposed referring to the Medical Assessor the dispute about whether
the claimant required attendant
care services for the visit to the shopping
parties uploaded messages to the portal advising they agreed with this course of
transport services dispute referred to the Commission should be referred for
medical assessment and included in the current referral
for assessment.
dispute referred for assessment is:
“Whether the attendant
care services provided to the claimant by a transport service provider (while he
was at the Mount Druitt
shopping centre for 3.5 hours on 3 May 2025) is related
to the injuries caused by the accident and is reasonable and necessary in
circumstances.”
dispute referred for medical assessment is not about the claimant’s travel
to and from the Mt Druitt shopping centre on
3 May 2025 and is also not about
the skills and qualifications of the transport service provider.
to the Medical Assessor’s determination, there may remain a dispute about
the cost of the attendant care services provided
by the unidentified taxi driver
and the taxi driver’s skills and qualifications may be relevant to the
reasonableness of the
cost issue. There may also be a dispute about the
reasonable cost of the mobility scooter if that was allowed. These can be the
of an application for Merit Review at the conclusion of the medical
assessment process.
