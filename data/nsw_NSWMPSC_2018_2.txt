Publication of decision:
Refer to paragraph 7 for a non-publication direction.
Introduction
task of this Professional Standards Committee is to inquire into a Complaint
brought by the Health Care Complaints Commission against
Dr Stephen Thomas
Prince. An eight-year old boy was slow to leave the
consulting room after Dr Prince had finished examining the boy’s sister
and she and her mother were departing. The Commission
says Dr Prince threatened
to boot out (kick) the boy if he did not leave, and then did kick him on the way
out, saying it was just
considered all the evidence we are satisfied Dr Prince did not kick the child.
Whilst criticism can be made of how Dr Prince
spoke to the boy, something that
Dr Prince acknowledges, his conduct did not amount to unsatisfactory
professional conduct. Accordingly,
there is no need for us to consider the
exercise any of the general powers set out in s146B of the
Practitioner Regulation National Law (NSW)
(the National Law).
National Law, s171E, requires us to provide this written statement of our
decision, setting out our findings on material questions
of fact, referring to
any evidence or other material on which our findings are based, and giving
reasons for our decision. Below
we deal with two applications for a non-
publication order before turning to the Complaint and the evidence, and then
the reasons for our decision.
publication order in respect of the child
the directions hearing the Commission, without objection by Dr Prince, requested
the chairperson make a direction (pursuant to
clause 7 of Schedule 5D of the
National Law) that no evidence be published that would identify the boy or his
sister, and that their
mother not be named or identified.
is the case where the person immediately affected by Dr Prince’s conduct
is a boy who was 8 years old at the time. We have
not heard directly from him.
His mother complained to the Commission and became a witness, although the
Commission is now the formal
complainant. When making her original report to the
Commission the mother said she did not object to being
identified if that were necessary. However, it does not appear at that time
she understood the public nature of proceedings before
a Professional Standards
Committee. To name or identify the mother or the boy’s sister would
identify the boy.
do not need to make the boy’s name public in order to undertake our
inquiry. To identify him may affect him in some way,
now or in the future. He
has a diagnosis of high functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder. The naming of
minors might inhibit complaints
to the Commission, or continued co-operation
with investigations by the Commission. There is nothing lost in our task or our
to the public if the boy’s identity is protected.
Wccordingly
a direction was made that the mother not be named and that no evidence be
published that would identify her or the boy
or his sister. The direction was
renewed at the commencement of our inquiry and is ongoing.
do not intend the direction to suggest that the individuality of the boy is
unimportant - to the contrary. Our inquiry has been
very much about his
experience and the impact of the events upon him. Throughout the hearing his
name was used by those giving evidence,
the parties, and the Committee, as were
the names of his sister and mother. Doing so helped us to keep him in mind. In
this regard
we were greatly assisted by his mother. She has a close, caring and
personal connection with her son, perhaps more than most. She
wanted us to have
a good and complete understanding of her son, and to appreciate the impact of
events upon him. We wish to thank
her for assisting us and standing by her son
from the outset.
of a second application for a non publication order
the commencement of the hearing an application was made on behalf of Dr Prince
that his name not be disclosed. The basis of the
application was that if we
ultimately concluded there was no unsatisfactory professional conduct then Dr
Prince should not be named
as to do so may have some impact on his reputation.
The Commission wanted to contest the application. Pending further argument, and
to allow the hearing to proceed without delay,
the requested direction was made by the chairman, but on an interim basis
only, for the hearing.
the conclusion of the hearing the application was renewed on the same basis. The
application was refused and no direction was made.
that we have concluded there was no unsatisfactory professional conduct we
explain why the chairperson did not make the requested
direction. By s170D(2) of
the National Law a direction made by the chairperson is taken to be a direction
of the Committee.
s171A(2) of the National Law the proceedings of this Committee are to be open to
the public unless the Committee directs otherwise.
Any direction necessarily
impinges on that requirement.
power to make a direction is set out in clause 7 of Schedule 5D of the National
Law. A direction can only be made if it is
appropriate
particular circumstances
. A direction can identify what matters are
“not to be published” and one of those is the name and address of Dr
By clause 7(4) the reference to name and address is taken to refer to
any information that identifies Dr Prince or “is likely
identification” of Dr Prince.
Clause 7(5) creates an offence for contravention of the direction.
was said that Dr Prince ought not be identified if there were to be no finding
of unsatisfactory professional conduct. Putting
the application on that basis
presents the Committee with the difficulty of considering whether to make a
direction before the Committee
has determined the question of whether the reason
for the direction sought to be made is yet established – there presently
being no finding of unsatisfactory professional conduct. The making of a
direction in advance of determining the substantive issue
could affect our
deliberations, in ways unknown, given that our deliberation as to conduct would
also determine whether the direction
would operate.
s171E of the National Law we must give a written statement of our decision
setting out findings on material questions of fact,
refer to the evidence, and
giving reasons for the decision. There is some tension between those
obligations and the consequences of making a non-publication direction. To
not publish Dr Prince’s name involves not publishing
information that is
likely to lead to his identification. The Committee itself would be bound by the
direction, and be liable to
prosecution, whilst at the same time having the
obligation to explain the basis of the decision in terms of the evidence and to
will necessarily consider the context of the alleged conduct and the evidence
relevant to the allegation. This case involves some
consideration of the
particular layout and surrounds of Dr Prince’s practice rooms where the
events took place. That evidence
could likely lead to identification. It would
be a difficult task for us to meet the obligation contained in s171E(2) whilst
same time ensuring that nothing was included in our statement of decision
that is likely to lead to the identification of Dr Prince.
tension between openness of reasoning and non-disclosure of identity reinforces
the importance of giving consideration to the
particular circumstances of a case
rather than proceeding on the generalised basis of there being no adverse
finding. That there
may be no adverse finding is not something that is
particular to this case.
say that Dr Prince’s reputation may be affected by publication of his name
is speculative, particularly so if the decision
is not adverse to him. It may
be that there are some individuals who are already aware of the Complaint. Were
a direction made those
individuals would never know the outcome of the Complaint
or even if there were an outcome.
of the National Law obliges the Medical Council of NSW to publish any statement
of decision if the complaint has been proved
or admitted in whole or in part,
and gives the Council the ability to publish any other decision as it thinks
fit, subject only to
an order of the Committee that the statement is not to be
made publicly available. Given the context, the reference to “an
order” is a reference to a direction given under s171A(2). Such a
direction is to be made in the public interest as required
by s171A(3). These
reinforce that proceedings are open to the public and are not to be
restricted by a direction unless appropriate in the particular
circumstances of
of the National Law requires that paramount consideration be given to the health
and safety of the public. That is a broad concept
but one of its aspects is that
decisions of Professional Standards Committees are published with reasons so
that the public can understand
and appreciate what is being done of their
behalf. There is also a benefit for practitioners in learning from the
decisions. To de-identify
a decision because there is no adverse finding reduces
the published decisions to being anodyne case studies, rather than examinations
of the conduct of a actual practitioner.
may be particular circumstances of a case where it is appropriate that the
practitioner is not identified. But the ability of
a Committee to make such a
direction arises only after identifying what is particular about the case. There
was nothing in the particular
circumstances of our case that meant it was
appropriate to make a non-publication direction as to Dr Prince’s name and
was for these reasons that the chairperson refused the application.
he Complaint
inquiry proceeded on Thursday 22 and Friday 23 February 2018. Robin Bhalla,
briefed by Brianna Butt, represented the Health Care
Complaints Commission, and
Ragni Mathur, instructed by Helen Turnbull of Avant, represented Dr Prince.
Complaint is of unsatisfactory professional conduct under s139B(1)(a) or
f the National Law. On 1 April 2015 the mother attended Dr Prince’s
rooms with her daughter, aged 5, for a consultation, and
was accompanied by her
son, aged 8. The particulars of the Complaint are as follows:
1 April 2015, at the end of the consultation, the practitioner inappropriately
said to the boy who was seated on a chair, words
to the effect of:
count to three and if you’re not out of my room in three, I’ll boot
you out. One ... two ....’
1 April 2015, at the end of the consultation the practitioner approached the boy
from behind and on the verbal count of ‘
, kicked the
1 April 2015 the practitioner, at the end of the consultation inappropriately
said whilst the mother, the daughter and the boy
were in the hallway outside the
consultation rooms words to the effect of:
It was only a joke’
was put by Mr Bhalla for the Commission that particular 1 on its own amounted to
unsatisfactory professional conduct even
if the Committee did not find
particulars 2 and 3 made out. Similarly, particular 2 on its own could be
unsatisfactory professional
conduct. However, whether particular 3 could amount
to unsatisfactory professional conduct depended upon whether there was a finding
on particular 1 or 2, or both.
Prince largely admitted Particular 1, but not 2 or 3. The issues for our
consideration are:
the facts of Particular 2 are established;
the facts of Particular 3 are established; and
if any, of these Particulars amount to unsatisfactory professional conduct
summary our findings are that the facts of Particular 1 are established, but not
Particular 2 or 3. The conduct complained of in
Particular 1 did not amount to
unsatisfactory professional conduct.
he evidence
mother gave evidence in person, as did Dr Prince and his receptionist Robyn
McCormack. Dr Emery Kertesz, as an expert engaged
by the Commission, gave
evidence by phone, as did Dr Stephen Oxlee, a general practitioner who had been
after the incident.
Commission had earlier provided the Committee with a bundle of documents tabbed
1 to 29 consisting of the original complaint,
investigation by the Commission, responses from Dr Prince, an expert report
from Dr Kertesz, an extract from UpToDate about Asperger
syndrome, and
medical Practice: A Code of Conduct for Doctors in Australia
. The folder was
marked Exhibit 1, and was later supplemented by an email chain between the
Commission and Dr Oxlee, added at tab
Mathur objected to the Committee receiving some of that material on the basis
that it was in the nature hearsay and Dr Prince was
denied the opportunity of
testing what was reported by the mother as having been said by others,
particularly her two children. There
was also objection to the conclusions and
speculations that the mother had made about the thoughts and actions of
task being one of inquiry, we received the material over those objections as we
considered it was capable of being relevant to
our inquiry and touched upon the
matters we were to determine.
received and marked as Exhibit A a folder of material on behalf of
Dr Prince. It consisted of a statement of Dr Prince of 19 December 2017 and
three reports from referees. Ms Mathur also provided
a bundle of photographs in
portrait format (marked Exhibit B) and a number in landscape format (marked
Exhibit C). The photographs
were of Dr Prince's consulting room, the corridor
leading to the reception waiting area and the reception waiting area itself. The
photographs were uncontroversial and were accepted by Dr Prince, Ms McCormack,
and the mother as fairly reflecting those locations
as they were on 1 April
inding in respect of
Particular 1
Prince acknowledged in writing that he had said words very similar to particular
1, but that he did not kick the boy or make any
comment about it being a joke.
He denied that the words in the context used could amount to unsatisfactory
professional conduct.
his statement and when giving evidence Dr Prince gave evidence about what he
said. The mother gave evidence that she heard the
words set out in
Particular 1. Later on the day Ms McCormack spoke to Dr Prince about the
incident he said to her, “
Because the kid wouldn’t leave the
room, I told him I’d count to three then boot him out
substance of the evidence from each of them on this point is the same: Dr Prince
warns or threatens that if the boy does not leave
within a certain time that he
will be booted out, with the implication of a kick being used, and there is a
count. What is important
in determining unsatisfactory conduct is the context in
which the words were said. In our view the minor differences in the words
alleged and as admitted are not sufficient to lead us to different conclusions
professional conduct.
It is not necessary that we determine the precise words used.
inding in respect of
Particular 2
the mother and Dr Prince say the consultation was fraught, though in different
ways, and each gives different explanations.
It was the end of a busy day for
all concerned. Whatever the reasons, there is no dispute that the boy did not
immediately respond
to his mother’s request to leave when the consultation
had ended. What is disputed is whether the mother was there to see a
there was one.
Prince and the mother give competing versions of what happened. It is not
possible to reconcile what each of them says happened.
We are required to decide
which version is the most likely.
explained below we have come to the conclusion that there was no kick. In
reaching our conclusion we accept that the mother and
Dr Prince both gave
evidence of what they believed happened.
was suggested that the mother had consciously exaggerated what had happened and
did so for the purpose of trying to secure some
benefit. It was also suggested
that she had been calculating in the way she reported the incident in her
various written statements.
We do not accept those criticisms of her
our view she genuinely believed and still believes that Dr Prince had kicked her
son. Nevertheless, it is apparent from the evidence
that there are
inconsistencies in how she explains what happened. These inconsistencies suggest
she may not have seen her son be
kicked by Dr Prince, but instead was responding
to her son telling her he had been kicked.
r Prince’s version of
Prince agrees the consultation was fraught. At the conclusion of the
consultation the mother and the daughter left the consulting
room but the boy
remained playing with the phone. Dr Prince was sitting in his desk chair but was
turned towards the boy. Dr Prince
Your mother and sister have
left, time to go
.” He said he did so in a calm but firm tone. There
was no reaction from the boy so Dr Prince said, “
The consultation is
over. Your mother has left. You need to leave
.” Again there was no
response from the boy.
Dr Prince says he then leant back in his chair and said calmly and more
If you don’t leave by the time I count to three,
I’ll have to boot you out
Remaining seated he counted slowly “
One ... Two
the count of two the boy jumped up and moved quickly towards the door. He
stopped near the open doorway and then turned to look
at Dr Prince who then
said, “Three”. The boy was then about three metres from him. At that
moment Dr Prince put his hands
on the arms of his desk chair and made to stand,
upon which the boy turned back and ran out of the room.
Prince says he remained in his room to organise paperwork and did not
immediately follow down the corridor. He said he did not
make any comments such
It was only a joke
Prince does not deny using words to say he would have to boot out the boy. Dr
Prince says the mother could have heard his words
from the corridor and out of
sight of the consulting room. Dr Prince said it was only necessary to say what
he did because the boy
was remaining in the room well after his mother had left
the room. Dr Prince gave evidence of the tone of his voice. The mother
he came out of his consulting room he says he saw the mother, son and daughter
at the end of the corridor about six or seven metres
away with their backs
towards him on their way to the reception room. By the time he reached the
reception room to collect the next
patient he saw the mother standing at the
reception desk but she probably did not see him
he mother’s version of
mother says that as she was leaving the surgery she turned and stood in the
doorway to give her son time to ready himself to leave.
It was then that Dr
Prince began to say what is alleged. As Dr Prince began to issue the warning she
said her son moved towards
her. It was when he was half way across the room and
within arms-reach that she says Dr Prince continued to count.
Totwithstanding
her son was already moving she said that Dr Prince continued with his counting
and when he reached
he turned his chair, stood up, stepped towards
her son and kicked him in his bottom. She acknowledges she did not see his foot
with her son but says that the rest of Dr Prince’s body was moving
as if he had made a kick. She demonstrated a man leaning
kicking leg and with arms high and outstretched. Dr Prince is a tall man. He
would have been close to the boy
and her at the time of the kick, but even so
she did not say which leg he used. She said she could not actually see the kick
son blocked her view. She says the kick was forceful enough to throw her
son forward towards her and for him to say, “Ow!”
mother says that after seeing the kick she was in shock, and her son was
downcast and withdrawn. She turned to walk down the
corridor with her children
towards the reception at which time she says she heard Dr Prince call out behind
It’s only a joke
”. She did not turn back but
went into the reception room to make arrangements. Her son sat on a chair near
the reception
desk but just out of sight of Ms McCormack. When first speaking to
Ms McCormack she told her that Dr Prince had kicked her son. She
called over her son to have him say to Ms McCormack what had happened, and
have Ms McCormack acknowledge her son.
vidence of Ms McCormack
McCormack recalls it differently. She says that the mother came to the
reception desk to pay the account and arrange for her daughter
to undergo a
procedure. She was aware the boy went to sit down but she did not notice
anything in particular about him that would
suggest he had suffered some trauma.
Ms McCormack spoke to the mother for a few moments about forms and so on.
McCormack says it was after this initial conversation that the mother stepped to
one side of the reception desk and bent down to
ask her son if he was all right,
a question asked in a way Ms McCormack thought was strange. Ms McCormack says
that the mother then
said to her that her son had said
Dr Prince had kicked him. Ms McCormack was certain she did not engage with
the son or acknowledge him in any way, as he was out of
her line of sight. The
mother then asked her to tell Dr Prince of her son’s comment. Ms McCormack
says that nothing was said
to her to suggest the mother had herself seen
Dr Prince kick the boy. Had that been said she would have reacted differently
and would have made a note in a work diary. Ms McCormack
makes use of a diary
system to record notes in relation to events at the practice or with particular
concluding the paperwork the mother left with her two children. The mother says
that she returned from the car to the reception
after hearing from her son that
he felt sore, and she felt she had to draw the matter to Dr Prince’s
attention more firmly.
The mother spoke to Ms McCormack and expressed her
concern at what had happened and said, “I compare it to
that afternoon Ms McCormack made a brief note that summarised all her
interactions with the mother. The note reads:
mother expressed her concerns (compared to assault) of SP’s actions
towards her son ... and asked me to advise SP accordingly.
(most inappropriate/son on spectrum/deal with his behaviour for ?how
use of the phrase ‘compared to assault’ might suggest there was a
threat of a kick, but not an actual kick. The
reference to ‘son on
spectrum’ we understand as a reference to the boy’s diagnosis of
high functioning Autism Spectrum
Commission provided an extract from UpToDate with respect to
syndrome (a specific autism spectrum disorder): Clinical features and diagnosis
in children and adolescents
. That extract describes how children with that
diagnosis tend to take literally what is said to them, and do not understand
or irony. It is likely that if the boy had been told he was to be kicked
then he might believe that he was kicked.
McCormack made a longer note on 4 June 2015, probably in response to becoming
aware of the Commission’s investigation. The
note is consistent with her
he mother’s
mother says that when getting into the car parked on the street in front of the
surgery, her son said, “It hurt”.
When she asked him what hurt he
said, “My bottom” and indicated an area deep within his tailbone.
She left her children
in the car and went back into the surgery to tell Ms
McCormack to convey that information to Dr Prince.
her version of events she had already seen Dr Prince kick her son with force so
it seems somewhat unusual that only by the time
she arrived at the car and there
was a complaint of pain did she feel the need to say more. Her return from the
car suggests she
had not seen the kick and it was only once her son complained
of pain that she though something more serious than what she thought
mother gives as a reason why she would have been in the doorway watching her son
was that she would never leave her son unattended
public place. That rationale is inconsistent with her return from the car to
the surgery.
was a evidence about what could or could not be seen from the reception room out
into the street. We were shown photographs
and saw a plan. There are windows in
the reception area facing towards the street. The glass is bubbled or obscured
glass for privacy
and covered by net curtains. It is about four or five metres
from those windows to the brick front fence which itself is about five
on the garden side, with three steps up to the footpath and the street. The car
was parked a little to the right when looking
directly out the window. Whilst it
might have been possible to see the outline of part of the top of the car
through the window the
car would have been out of sight when standing at the
desk facing towards Ms McCormack.
mother says she was in the doorway watching her son because she would never
leave him unattended, and yet she did just that a
few moments later when she
returned to the surgery to again speak to Ms McCormack. We do not suggest
anything critical in leaving
her children in the car when she returned to the
surgery. But the conduct is inconsistent with her explanation of why she was at
the consulting room door and could see what happened.
all to the GP
next day she said she called up her GP, Dr Daniel Oxlee and told him what had
happened. She reports him as saying, “
There is no point coming into the
centre to substantiate that the kick had happened as it could be argued that the
injury/bruise/bump
could have been caused by anything
”. Dr Oxlee says
he was not asked to examine the boy, and he was not told of any specific injury
apart from the complaint of
the mother saw the area on her son where he said he had been kicked she says
there was no injury/bruise/bump that was obvious
to her. Had she seen an
injury, bruise or bump then no doubt she would have sought some treatment.
than reflecting that the mother had seen a kick we think the telephone call is
more consistent with the mother querying with
the GP whether the absence of an
injury, bruise or bump meant that there was no kick. In asking the question she
may have been trying
to work out in her own mind whether there had been a
Oxlee told her to take up the issue with Dr Prince and if she was not satisfied
to contact the Commission, which she later did.
he recorded interview
next day she made a recording of questions she asked her son, the first question
and answer being:
just tell me in your own words what happened yesterday at the doctors.
huh. Well, we were at the doctors and
was seeing him, and the
doctor said something that I couldn’t quite hear and he then started
counting and I got up and I went
out with you and then he kicked me on the
mother says this answer was unprompted. The mother asked a number of subsequent
questions to each of which her son gives brief
or one word answers, quite in
contrast to his first answer as recorded. As well as being detailed and
mentioning the kick his recorded
answer includes a piece of information
essential to support the mother’s version of events that she was with him
all the time
and I went out with you.
It is difficult to avoid
the conclusion that the answer given reflects what the mother wanted to hear,
and in that sense the boy’s
response is not spontaneous or unaffected by
any tendency to say what his mother wishes to hear.
omplaint to the
the day she had made detailed handwritten notes of what had happened. The mother
used these notes to complete the complaint form
she provided by the Commission.
There was little in the document provided to the Commission
that went beyond the notes she made at the time, almost word for word. But
it was not until 18 May 2015, some seven weeks later,
that she sent the
completed form to the Commission. The mother explains the delay by saying she
was thinking about what to do, and
that may be correct. Nevertheless, the delay
also suggests some uncertainty in recollection and thus some hesitancy about
her version of events in writing for the Commission.
a month later the mother commented on Dr Prince’s version of what
happened. She makes a point that Dr Prince should read
up on the literature
concerning children with autism spectrum disorder. There is no suggestion or
evidence that Dr Prince knew at
the time that the boy had a diagnosis of autism
spectrum disorder. That comment suggests she wanted to warn
Dr Prince to be careful with children with autism spectrum disorder because
they can take literally what is said as a joke. The comment
adds nothing to
whether the kick happened.
mother provided further information to the Commission in response to email
enquiries on specific points and also provided a comprehensive
statement of 6
May 2016 prepared with the assistance of the Commission. The different written
versions of the events are generally
consistent with the evidence she gave to us
although the later versions tend to be more elaborate and detailed. Whilst not
significant
on its own it does appear to the Committee that the mother’s
evidence as to how much she saw or knew of the kick has became
stronger and more
detailed over time.
of the evidence concerning Particular 2
are some inconsistencies in the evidence provided by the mother. She has her
son walking on the way out when Dr Prince is saying
the words about having to
boot him out. There seems no reason for Dr Prince to have gone down that path if
the boy was already moving
and he was said to be within an arm’s length of
her at the doorway when the kick took place. It is hard to understand why Dr
Prince would have stood up and stepped towards the boy when he was already
moving and so close to his mother at that moment standing
in the doorway. The
mother gives a dramatic explanation of how
Dr Prince’s body was moving at the time of the kick but had trouble
with which leg he used and how his foot connected with son,
saying that her view
was obscured by her son.
may be so in respect of any actual contact by a shoe with her son’s
backside. However, on her version she and her son and
Dr Prince were all within
a metre or so of each other yet she was unable to explain to us what happened
apart from stating the conclusion
that Dr Prince kicked her son. That she had
some difficulty or lack of clarity in describing what happened suggests some
uncertainty
on her part.
boy’s rush from the room after Dr Prince said
might well have been understood or seen by the mother in the corridor as him
stumbling forward after having received what she later
thought was a kick.
the evidence we are satisfied the mother had left the surgery room ahead of her
son and that Dr Prince did not kick the
boy. Of the competing versions of what
happened that of Dr Prince is consistent and coherent. The mother’s
version has a number
of inconsistences. Those inconsistences taken together are
more suggestive of her not having seen a kick, but instead believing that
had taken place because that is what Dr Prince said he would do and that is what
her son told her had happened. In summary,
those inconsistencies are:
Prince giving a warning and continuing with the warning does not sit with the
mother still being in the room at the time, or that
her son had begun to
that she did not see the actual kick, even though she would have been close
enough to have seen more:
with Ms McCormack as if there had been no kick at least until asking her son
then if he was all right;
McCormack recalling that the mother reported that her son had said he had been
kicked, but not that she had seen the kick;
McCormack’s note of the mother saying what had happened was to be compared
to an assault, implying it was not an assault;
request to Ms McCormack to pass on her son’s comment, rather than saying
it was her own complaint;
return from the car after her son said it hurt, even though the mother must have
already known that was likely given how she described
the force of the kick that
return from the car, in the context of using her practice of not leaving her son
alone to bolster her statement that she was in
the doorway at the time of the
inquiry of Dr Oxlee about whether absence of any signs meant there was no
level of detail in her son’s answer about what happened;
time taken to lodge her complaint with the Commission given her acknowledgment
that the information was readily available; and
Dr Prince to review the literature on autism spectrum disorder in order to
understand how her son could have taken his joke
Aotwithstanding
our conclusion it was appropriate that the Complaint was brought. There was an
allegation of physical harm to a child.
It is only upon inquiry that we have
been able to come to a conclusion as to what happened.
inding in respect of
Particular 3
respect to Particular 3 we have concluded that Dr Prince did not call out and
It was only a joke
.” Dr Prince says his intention was
not to make a joke, but to encourage the boy to leave. There would have been
little reason
for Dr Prince to call out after the mother and make that comment
other than in a defensive response to some reaction from her. Her
evidence was
that she did not react but simply continued on her way out and down the
corridor. The mother may have thought that
what Dr Prince said could only have
been intended as a joke, and for that reason believes he said so.
a few moments Dr Prince left his room to the reception area to collect the next
patient, knowing the mother was still there.
It is not likely that he would have
done that so quickly after making the joke comment and run the risk of seeing
the mother again.
if he did say the words our view that Dr Prince’s overall conduct did not
amount to unsatisfactory professional conduct
does not change. We observe that
the words, if said, would be consistent with no kick. It is unlikely that
Dr Prince would have thought to use those words to explain or justify a kick;
a kick that required him to lean back for balance, and
had sufficient force to
hurt and to propel the boy forward.
verall finding
Prince did use the one/two/three warning with the boy, but did not kick him, and
did not say it was a joke.
reaching this conclusion we do not suggest that the mother has deliberately
given a version of events contrary to what she now
believes. It was obvious to
us that she has a close and deep understanding of her son’s condition and
is most caring and concerned
son might not understand jokes and will take literally what he is told.
There is no doubt she believes that her son believes Dr Prince kicked
understandably she accepts that reality. In order to provide genuine emotional
support to her son she may need to see her experience
of what happened through
the lens of her son’s belief. For a parent providing care for their child
there is an understandable
tension between dispassionate objectivity and the
wholehearted acceptance of the child’s lived experience.
of unsatisfactory professional conduct
now consider whether Dr Prince’s conduct in speaking to the boy as he did
amounted to unsatisfactory professional conduct.
phrase unsatisfactory professional conduct carries its ordinary meaning, but is
also defined by the various sub-paragraphs of
s139B(1). The Complaint by the
Commission was that Dr Prince’s conduct fell to be considered under
s139B(1)(a) or (1)(l) of
the National Law and not on any other basis.
significantly below reasonable standard?
Kertesz, the expert called by the Commission, assessed the conduct under
s139B(1)(a) and expressed the view the that the words
used by Dr Prince in
context fell substantially below the standard reasonably expected of a
practitioner of Dr Prince’s level of training or experience, although
he conceded that other practitioners might take a different
Kertesz was critical of Dr Prince’s behaviour in using the words because
he said the statement was threatening, especially
when given by a person of
authority such as a medical practitioner to an eight-year old child. The child
would have understood the
threat as involving the risk physical harm or at least
physical contact. It was a statement that Dr Prince should not have used.
Kertesz did concede that in some circumstance or in other contexts words of that
kind said to a child might not fall below the
standard expected. However, the
gist of Dr Kertesz's criticism was that the present circumstances did not
demonstrate that Dr Prince
had made a thoughtful assessment of what was the
right way that he should conduct himself as a medical practitioner in response
the boy remaining in the room. There were other more professional options
such as calling the receptionist and requesting her to
ask the boy’s
mother to return to collect her son. What also concerned Dr Kertesz was that the
words were combined with Dr
Prince’s movement from his chair on the count
of ‘three’, indicating that the kick was now on the way.
Dr Kertesz did concede that others in the profession might take a different
is not clear that the complained of conduct falls to be considered under
s139B(1)(a). The sub-section is in terms of ‘the
knowledge, skill or
judgment possessed, or care exercised by the practitioner in the practice of the
practitioner’s profession’
being below the expected standard. Dr
Prince was not providing care to the boy, and his patient had left the room. Was
time then in the practice of his profession? There will be a boundary
to what is in the practice of the profession.
Kertesz did not connect the expected standard to any knowledge, or skill, or
judgment, or care, but rather made a more generalised
assessment of what could
be reasonably expected of any practitioner – an assessment perhaps better
considered under s139B(1)(l).
There was no consideration of what
might be the training or experience against which Dr Prince’s conduct
was to be evaluated.
seeking to resolve the precise limitations on s139B(1)(a) we do not consider
that Dr Prince’s conduct fell
significantly
below the standard. In
reaching that conclusion we do not look only at the words that Dr Prince used
but also the surrounding circumstances.
The mother had left the room and
Dr Prince has twice asked the boy to leave. Dr Prince said he sat in a
relaxed way in his chair and twice, in a calm steady tone,
asked him to leave
now that the consultation was over and his mother had left. When there was no
response he was met with a problem
he had not encountered before, and of which
he had no experience. He then spoke to gain the boy’s attention, and was
successful,
as he stood and moved towards the door. That he stopped to look over
his should suggested to Dr Prince that the boy understood there
was no real risk
of a kick, and that he was waiting for the ‘three’ before leaving
Dr Prince could have acted in a better way does not mean his conduct can be said
to have fallen substantially below what was
to be expected.
ther improper or
unethical conduct?
Onsatisfactory
professional conduct is also defined as ‘any other improper or unethical
conduct relating to the practice ...
of the practitioner’s
profession”. We are of the view that Dr Prince’s engagement with the
boy was conduct relating
to his practice. It took place in his consulting room
at the conclusion of a consultation. The boy was there under the care of his
mother whilst
Dr Prince examined his sister. How Dr Prince deals with those who come to
his rooms in circumstance of this kind is conduct that
clearly relates to his
was not put to us that there was anything unethical in Dr Prince’s conduct
and we agree. But was it improper? And what is
meant by ‘improper’,
in this context?
definition requires that the assessment of what is improper is to be considered
in the context of the practitioner’s profession.
What might be improper
conduct for one health profession might not be considered improper for another.
We do not believe that the
word ‘improper’ is to be given so
extensive a meaning as to encompass anything that was ‘not proper’.
will be conduct that falls somewhere between proper and improper.
us improper conduct is conduct that is somehow antithetical, or contrary, or
harmful, or negative, or weakening of the practice
of the medical profession,
and that other members of the profession would readily agree. In addition there
needs to be an aspect
of the practitioner being thoughtless, or uncaring, or
lackadaisical, or in some way ignorant of the considerations of behaving within
the profession in a way that is creditworthy of the profession. It is conduct
of this kind that is improper.
mentioned above the circumstances were new the Dr Prince. He did think about how
to proceed and took those initial steps, about
which there can be no criticism.
He drew on his own history and used a style of words that he had used before in
his practice when
saying to his patients in hospital (ready for discharge) that
if they didn’t leave he would have to boot them out tomorrow,
by way of levity that he would let them use the lift.
Prince said he had used the one, two, three formulation a number of times with
his own children. The count of one, two, three,
gave the child a chance to make
a decision, take control of the situation and then leave during the count at a
time of their own
choosing. Dr Prince spoke to the boy as he had with his own
Prince had thought he had dealt with the circumstances properly and without
problem, and he was able to walk out into the reception
without any thought that
he had done something wrong. His evidence is that he gave thought to what he
did and believed he had acted
at in overall context we do not think that Dr Prince’s conduct can be
described as improper.
could be made of Dr Prince in not taking another tactic such as ringing through
to the reception to ask Ms McCormack to
speak to the mother to return and
collect her son. Perhaps Dr Prince could have stepped out of his room himself
and called back the
mother. That he did not take an alternative does not mean
that what he did do was improper in the practice of his profession.
o unsatisfactory
professional conduct
are not satisfied there was any unsatisfactory professional conduct as alleged
in the Complaint.
we come to a different view in respect of Particular 1 we would not have
exercised any of the powers under s146B of the National
Law. Dr Prince said
that he now realised that the words he used were not the best and in that
looking back he should have taken
a different approach and used different
language. He sees that his conduct did have an adverse impact on the mother and
and also on himself. The circumstances were unusual and of a kind
unlikely to be repeated. Dr Prince readily accepts that he should
differently and has a good grasp of how to respond to a similar problem in the
future. There is no suggestion of any weakness
in Dr Prince’s practice
generally, and he is well thought of by his colleagues. In those circumstances
it would not have been
necessary to consider exercising the powers available
under s146B of the National Law.
make no finding of unsatisfactory professional conduct against Dr Prince.
