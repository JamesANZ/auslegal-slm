Application for extension of time to make a claim against the fund –

REASONS FOR DECISION
is an application, pursuant to and
section 511
Property Agents and
Motor Dealers Act 2000
, for an extension of time within which the applicant
may make a claim against the claim fund.
claim was made to the Office of Fair Trading on 28 May 2009, but the applicant
became aware of her possible loss on about 30 January
2008. The period of
income to which the claim relates is October and November 2007.
it is not expressly stated in the application and supporting material, it
appears that the basis for the proposed proceeding
is that the respondent was a
property agent who has failed to account to the applicant for rental proceeds
from the management of
a property owned (at the relevant times) by the applicant
and managed by the respondent. Thus the proposed claim against the fund
to arise from an alleged contravention of Chapter 12,
, and a possible
misappropriation of funds entrusted to the respondent by the applicant.
property was a unit in a building known as The Grand Apartments, in Labrador.
The applicant says that she will seek an order
that the respondent provide a
final statement and pay to her the money owed from letting the apartment. The
apartment was held in
a pool of apartments available for short-term letting.
The applicant sold it in November 2007. The sale was to an owner/occupier,
someone who did not want to be part of the letting pool, and it was therefore
necessary for the proposed respondent to arrange
for bookings that had been made
for the period post completion of the sale to be transferred to other apartments
in the building.
The applicant openly accepted at the time liability for any
costs involved in transferring those bookings. The applicant subsequently
sought a final statement and payment for the period from the end of September
2007 to the settlement of the contract. The last statement
received by the
applicant was for September 2007.
applicant states that she first waited until the end of the Christmas and
January holiday period for a final statement. She then
made some attempts to
messages. Her husband then became
seriously ill and she finally wrote to the
respondent on 29 June 2008 requesting a final statement. She did not receive
such a statement,
nor any reply.
applicant has not really explained the delay from June 2008 until she filed a
complaint with the Office of Fair Trading in May
2009. She does say that, in
early 2009, she retained a solicitor who again wrote to the respondent stating a
time within which the
final statement and payment should be made. Again there
was no response.
respondent has been served with this application, but has chosen not to respond
in any way to it. In the circumstances, there
seems to be no likelihood of any
prejudice to the respondent by the delay.
Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000
govern when
payments may be made out of a trust account. Under
subsection 385(4)
licensee must pay to the client the net proceeds in the trust account within 14
days of a request to do so. Under
section 386
, a licensee is required to
account to the client for the funds received and expenses incurred in respect of
the property within 14
days of a request to do so. The applicant alleges that
the respondent has failed to do either of these things in respect of the
applicant’s property in October and November 2007.
seems to me that the applicant therefore has a good arguable case against the
respondent, or for a claim against the fund. No
prejudice to the respondent is
the applicant has not given a satisfactory explanation for the whole period of
the delay, I am satisfied that the justice
of the matter, particularly given the
apparently meritorious case that the applicant has, justifies an extension of
time being granted.
applicant received notice from the Chief Executive that her claim was out of
time on 3 July 2009. She filed this application
on 14 July 2009. I am
therefore satisfied that the application was filed within the time provided by
section 475(3)
of the Act.
therefore propose to order that the period within which the applicant may make a
claim against the claim fund in respect of the
respondent’s alleged
failure to account for the income and expenses in respect of the property and to
pay to the applicant
the net proceeds in its trust account, be extended to 30
October 2009.
