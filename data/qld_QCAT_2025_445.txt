REASONS FOR DECISION
Applicant and the Respondent (‘the parties’) are adjoining
of properties situated at
Casey Close in Ormiston. The Applicant owns Number 8, and the Respondent is the
owner of Number 7.
[2] On 19 June
2024 the Applicant commenced an
Application for a tree dispute
Neighbourhood Disputes (Dividing Fences and Trees) Act 2011
(‘the Act’), seeking orders from the Tribunal in relation to a
tree stump and roots on Number 7 pushing up against a brick
wall on the
boundary, thereby cracking and moving the brickwork.
[3] Photographs
accompanying the Application reveal a rendered brick fence, comprising slatted
aluminium in-fill panels each of about
1.8 metres positioned between rendered
brick columns, with an accompanying low (approximately 200 mm) rendered brick
infill section,
also between the columns, and immediately beneath the aluminium
in-fill panels.
photographs accompanying the Application show a tree on Number 7, growing hard
up against a section of the brick boundary
fence, with an obvious crack through
one infill section, as well as ground heave, very obviously caused by the roots
of the tree.
offending tree was cut down on 15 March 2024 by a contractor, under instructions
from the Respondent. However, the roots
of the tree remained
until as recently as 9 November 2024, when these were finally removed by a
contractor retained by the Applicant during the repair
of the brick infill. The
Respondent agreed to these works and paid the Applicant $1,176, yet only after
an on-site mediation between
the parties which was facilitated by Member Bishop.
[6] Relatedly,
the Applicant had commenced Application Q4308-24, being an
Application for
Minor Civil Dispute – Dividing Fences
in relation to the damaged
condition of the boundary fence. This was brought to an end by orders of the
Tribunal made on 6 May 2024,
requiring only that the Respondent pay to the
Applicant $153.70, representing the cost of the filing fee for the Applicant to
Application Q4308-24.
[7] On 29 May
2025 the parties advised the Tribunal that the only outstanding issues in
NDR105-24 related to payment of the sum of
$452.61 by the Respondent to the
Applicant for the filing fee and some related costs. On 25 July 2024 the
Applicant filed an
Application for miscellaneous matters
confirming that
the additional costs beyond now claimed (beyond the original application fee)
comprised: $23.27 for a current title
current title search for 8 Casey Close; and $25.78 for a copy of the registered
Casey Close.
Respondent’s contentions
Respondent contends that she has already paid $153.70 as costs to the Applicant
and should not now be required to pay three
separate application fees related to
the same dispute.
Applicant’s contentions
Applicant contends that the Respondent’s prior payment of $153.75 relates
to the Dividing Fence Dispute Q4308-24, and
that he should be entitled to the
filing fee of $79.50 in NDR105-24, by reason that the Tribunal’s
procedures require the filing
of two separate applications for the tree matter
(NDR105-24) and the fence matter (Q4308-24).
[10] In relation
to the other costs now claimed by the Applicant it is submitted that the claim
is reasonable, given that directions
3 and 4 as made by the Tribunal on 25 June
2024 mandated that the Applicant file copies of current title searches for each
8 Casey Close at Ormiston in the Tribunal, as well as a copy of the
registered plan for 7 Casey Close at Ormiston. Receipts in proof
of the costs
incurred by the Applicant to comply with those directions have been
Tribunal Assessment and Orders
[10] All of the amounts now claimed by the Applicant
are reasonable, and are no more than necessary to compensate for amounts
necessarily
incurred by the Applicant for his having been required to commence
Application NDR105-24. These amounts are routinely allowed by
the Tribunal in
fence or tree disputes.
[11] The Tribunal orders that the Respondent is to pay the Applicant the
following amounts within 14 days of the date of these orders:
Filing fee for NDR105-25: $379.50
Title search fee (7 Casey Close): $23.27
Title search fee (8 Casey Close): $24.06
Registered plan fee (7 Casey Close): $25.78
Total payable: $452.61
