CRITIQUE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE TO CORPORATE LAW REFORM
AND CHARLIE
Corporations Act 2001
(Cth) is a complex and lengthy statute that
is frequently the subject of law reform inquiries. However, the recommendations
in the final reports of those inquiries often appear to receive little
or no response from, or to be rarely implemented by, the federal
government. In
this article, we detail the final reports from inquiries that have recommended
reforms to the Act and its underlying
regulations, determine the extent to which
those recommended reforms have received a response from, or been implemented by,
the federal
government and consider the consequent implications for corporate
law reform. We then put forward a set of proposals that are intended
appropriately enhance the federal government’s engagement with corporate
law reform.

In ancient Athens, whenever some calamity threatened the city — for
instance plague or famine — an unfortunate group of
individuals called the

as a kind of sponge to sop up impurities and sins and were afterwards

René Girard, crises can lead humans to construct symbolic

Girard’s work, we argue that law reform inquiries, which commonly take
place in the aftermath of perceived financial

reflective of a symbolic and highly visible act of purification. In other words,
we contend that law reform

symbolically mobilised whenever the occurrence of some crisis appears to

the law reform bodies that conducted those inquiries, and those who

In this article, we aim to quantify the unresponsiveness of the federal

Despite our focus on corporate law reform, we do not suggest that this area of
reform should be prioritised over others.
Rather, this article uses corporate
law reform, as a highly topical and pertinent example, to highlight issues that
are likely to
be relevant across other areas of law reform.

The difficulties in this framework can be traced back to the drafting of
constitutional powers for the Commonwealth legislature and
the challenges in
implementing a national corporation law in
Due to concerns about federal government overreach and state governments’
desires to preserve revenue derived from company
registration schemes, it was
decided at Federation that the
Constitution
would not confer
‘unqualified federal power’ over corporate
regulation.
Instead, the federal Parliament was granted the (rather ambiguous) power to make
laws only with respect to ‘foreign corporations,
and trading or financial
corporations formed within the limits of the
Commonwealth’.
Consequently, for nearly eight decades after Federation, corporate
regulation in Australia was largely contained in separate, and
sometimes greatly
dissimilar, state
A significant step towards a national corporations law framework was made
in December 1978: the federal, state and Northern Territory
governments agreed to participate in a cooperative scheme whereby each state and
the NT would pass model legislation
to enshrine a uniform national corporations
However, in the subsequent 10 years, this cooperative scheme faced mounting
pressure due to legislative and administrative deficiencies
and underfunding of
the National Companies and Securities Commission (the regulator that was
established under the cooperative scheme
and that was accountable to a council
of federal and state ministers).
Ultimately, on the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on
Constitutional and Legal Affairs, the federal Parliament enacted
legislation (‘1989 Legislation’), foremost among which was the
Corporations Act 1989
(Cth), in an attempt to become the sole legislator
of corporate law in
The 1989 Legislation not only sought to replace the first cooperative scheme
statutes but also established a new corporate regulator,
the Australian
Securities Commission (the predecessor of the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission (‘ASIC’)),
that was beholden only to the
federal government.
In 1990, the
constitutional validity of the 1989 Legislation was successfully challenged by
the states in the High Court, which held
that certain provisions of the
Corporations Act 1989
(Cth) — those providing for the
‘general incorporation of companies throughout the
Commonwealth’
were unconstitutional.
of constitutional basis in the 1989 Legislation was addressed in the short-term
by a second cooperative scheme that commenced
in 1991 through which each state
and the NT passed legislation that implemented, in substance, the 1989
Legislation.
However, the constitutional basis of that scheme was also called into question
in the High Court in 1999 and

framework has largely been relegated to the annals of history,
another issue
occasioned by the 1989 Legislation has refused to lie dormant. In its efforts to
consolidate corporate law in a comprehensive
national corporations law framework
in 1989, the federal government created a framework that was reviled for its
convolution: for

enactment, has experienced rapid growth, having increased in its word count by
48% between 2001 and
More recent additions to the
Corporations Act
have arguably been
beneficial and go some way to adapting the Act’s legislative framework to
align with Australia’s modern
corporate environment by, for example,
increasing ASIC’s capacity to detect and prosecute corporate crime,
enhancing protections
for corporate whistleblowers and facilitating new methods
for corporate
fundraising.
Nevertheless, Robert Austin, a former judge of the Supreme Court of New South
Wales, has observed that ‘major changes to statutory
corporate law’
between 2001 and 2015 have been characterised by their
‘technicality’ and their ‘abandonment
of the principles of

Given the difficult genesis of Australia’s national corporations law

with express aims such as ‘restoring trust in Australia’s financial

government and 50% have had none of their

government to these law reform inquiries, we will: (a) provide
an analysis of
the federal government’s response to, and implementation of,

qualitative issues that we observed while undertaking our analysis; (c) examine

III METHODOLOGY AND
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Methodology
For the purposes of this article, we analysed the degree to which
Corporations Act
reform recommendations published in law reform inquiry
reports have received a response from, or been implemented by, the federal
government. This analysis:
1 Was confined to reports:
a) Issued by the following law reform bodies or their predecessors: the
Australian Law Reform Commission (‘ALRC’), the
former Corporations
and Markets Advisory Committee (‘CAMAC’), the House of
Representatives Standing Committee on Economics
and its predecessor, the House
of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public
Administration (together, the
‘House Committee’), the Parliamentary
Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services (‘PJC’), the
Productivity Commission, the Senate Standing Economics References Committee
(‘Senate Committee’) and royal commissions
(each a ‘Reporting
Body’ and, collectively, the ‘Reporting Bodies’);
b) Published between 15 July 2001 (when the
Corporations Act
Corporations Regulations
came into force) and 31 December 2022; and
c) That include recommendations that either:
i) Explicitly recommended amending the
Corporations Act
, associated
amending legislation or the
Corporations Regulations
ii) Explicitly recommended general amendments to a group of legislation
stated in the report to include the
Corporations Act
, associated amending
legislation or the
Corporations Regulations
2 Excluded otherwise relevant reports that:
a) Were not ‘final reports’ (eg consultation papers, discussion
papers and issues papers);
b) Were directed solely at inquiries into proposed bills; or
c) Only recommended that:
i) The law should remain the same;
ii) An amendment, or suite of amendments, should merely be
‘considered’ (that is, as opposed to an explicit recommendation
enact an amendment or suite of amendments);
iii) A model provision proposed elsewhere (eg in a separate report of a
Reporting Body) should be supported or dismissed without specifying
particular amendment should be enacted; or
iv) A separate review should be established into whether a particular
amendment should be adopted.
We acknowledge that, inevitably, there have been significant
Corporations
reform recommendations proposed, responded to or implemented that
originated in reports that do not satisfy all of the above
Regardless, these
criteria were applied strictly to ensure that the analytical parameters of this
article could be accurately defined
and so that the findings of that analysis
could be rigorously tested.
The Reporting Bodies specified above were chosen for our analysis because
each body has issued multiple reports that contain
Corporations Act
reform recommendations and, by virtue of their respective mandates or treatment
by the federal government or federal Parliament,
appears to currently be or has
previously been positioned as integral in the corporate law reform process.
There are, however, substantial
differences between each Reporting Body. This is
perhaps most evident in how each body is, or has been, established. For example,
the members of the Senate Committee and the House Committee are appointed by
either the Senate or the House of Representatives pursuant
to the respective
standing orders of those chambers at the commencement of each federal
Parliament, and they are usually re-established
in some form after each federal
Meanwhile, the PJC is established through a resolution of both the Senate
and the House of Representatives at the commencement of
each federal Parliament;
the power to do so is enshrined in
Australian Securities and
Investments Commission Act 2001
On the other hand, pursuant to
Royal Commissions Act 1902
(Cth), a royal commission can only be established through letters patent issued
by the Governor-General ‘on the advice of the
[federal] government via the
Federal Executive
Conversely, the ALRC, Productivity Commission and CAMAC were all established
solely through
legislation.
The Reporting Bodies also differ in terms of their remit: only the PJC has
(although CAMAC also had prior to its abolition) a mandate
predominantly focused
on reviewing or inquiring into corporate law and related
Further differences between the Reporting Bodies can be observed in their
respective capacities to initiate inquiries. The PJC and
the Productivity
Commission are, and CAMAC was, empowered to initiate inquiries into matters that
they have chosen as well as into
matters referred to them by the federal
government or federal
Parliament.
However, the ALRC
can only commence inquiries after receiving formal terms of reference from the
Attorney-General,
the Senate Committee and the House Committee can
only inquire into matters referred by the applicable House of Parliament on an
hoc or standing basis and a royal commission can only be commenced by the
issuing of letters patent by the
Governor-General.

On the other hand, the PJC’s powers (which include the capacity to conduct

The reports that satisfied the aforementioned criteria were categorised in
our analysis as follows:

government to all the relevant recommendations could be identified.
includes responses in official federal government documents such as a dedicated
response document, press or media release or
explanatory memorandum to proposed
legislation. The mere mention of a relevant recommendation in such a document
was not considered
to be a ‘response’. Rather, a
‘response’ was recorded where such a document explicitly
a) The federal government’s position with respect to a relevant
recommendation (eg a statement to the effect that a recommendation
‘accepted’, ‘rejected’, ‘supported’ or
‘not supported’); or
b) Discussion of a relevant recommendation in the context of explaining a
proposed or enacted amendment;
2 ‘Partial response’: when a formal response from the federal
government to some, but not all, of the relevant recommendations
identified;
3 ‘No response’: when no formal response from the federal
government to the relevant recommendations could be identified;
4 ‘Wholly implemented’: when all of the relevant recommendations
given report were implemented in accordance with how they were
specified in that report. For the avoidance of doubt, a recommendation in a
specific report was considered ‘implemented’
even where that
recommendation was:
a) Reiterated or rearticulated in one or more separate, subsequent reports
prior to its implementation;
b) Implemented and then repealed through successive legislation;
5 ‘Partially implemented’: when some, but not all, of the
relevant recommendations were implemented as specified in a
given report. Where
a recommendation has been implemented but not in the form set out in that report
(eg the relevant amending legislation
omitted an exclusion or specific
terminology recommended in the report), that recommendation was deemed
‘partially implemented’;
6 ‘No implementation’: when none of the relevant recommendations
have been implemented.
For the purposes of our analysis, only formal responses issued and evidence
of recommendations implemented until 15 April 2024 have
been considered.

Our analysis of the 52 reports that satisfied the aforementioned criteria
reveals significant statistical trends in the federal government’s
response and implementation practices when it comes to corporate law reform.
Notably, 40.38% of these reports received no formal
federal government response
Corporations Act
reform recommendations while a further 13.46%
only received a partial response. In addition, only 3.85% of these reports have
Corporations Act
reform recommendations wholly implemented by
the federal government and 50% saw no implementation of their recommendations
whatsoever.
It should be noted that the federal government is under no formal obligation
to implement recommendations in reports issued by the
In addition, while the
federal government is required to formally respond to Senate Committee, House
Committee and PJC reports, there
is currently no such requirement for reports
issued by the ALRC, Productivity Commission or royal commissions, and there was
requirement regarding CAMAC
However, regardless of any such formal obligation being in place, formal
responses to, or legislative implementation of, a report’s
Corporations
reform recommendations appear to be the only means by which the public
can ascertain whether the federal government has considered
or acted upon those
recommendations.
In addition, while we acknowledge that the federal government may have issued
informal responses to the
Corporations Act
reform recommendations
analysed in this article (eg discussions in parliamentary debates or quotes in
independent media articles),
such responses were not recorded due to (a) the
innumerable media and publishers through which they could have been issued would
have created logistical issues in confirming the existence of such responses
with a sufficient degree of certainty and (b) the difficulty
in determining
whether such responses were made on behalf of the federal government or,
alternatively, merely constituted an individual’s
Accordingly, we have
framed the federal government’s ‘responsiveness’ (or lack
thereof) by reference to the metrics
outlined in
Part III(A).
Adopting this approach, we consider our findings to broadly indicate the
federal government’s low and inconsistent degree of
responsiveness to
Corporations Act
reform recommendations. This corresponds with the
results of a recent study on public inquiries (which focused on royal
commissions)
that found that the federal government’s implementation of
published recommendations was ‘less than
impressive’.
When our findings are broken down by reference to each Reporting Body, it can be
seen that the reports issued by royal commissions
and the Senate Committee
received the greatest proportion of whole responses from the federal government:
66.67% in both cases.
reports also exhibited the highest degree of whole or partial implementation of
Corporations Act
reform recommendations: 100% and 66.67%
respectively.
Meanwhile, the
ALRC and CAMAC reports received the lowest proportion of whole responses: 16.67%
and 23.08% respectively.
issued by CAMAC saw the third-lowest degree of whole or partial implementation
(46.15%) and ALRC reports experienced the
equal-second-lowest degree of such
implementation alongside those issued by the Productivity Commission (33.33%),
whose reports also
received the equal-third-lowest proportion of whole responses
Two interesting patterns can be observed from this statistical breakdown.
First, reports that have received a whole formal federal
government response
tend to have been implemented to a higher degree. Secondly, reports issued by
Reporting Bodies with a significant
public profile — such as a royal
commission or the Senate Committee — are more likely to receive both a
whole formal
response and see their recommendations implemented than reports
issued by Reporting Bodies that are comparatively less public-facing.
patterns can be tied to perceptions of the federal government’s
accountability to the public: the more that a report is
thrust into the public
consciousness (either by virtue of a formal federal government response or a
Reporting Body’s stature),
the more pressure is built for the federal
government to follow through with implementation of the contents of its response
report or to otherwise implement that report’s
Corporations
reform recommendations.
This explanation aligns with Paul Burstein’s analysis of the relationship
between public opinion and public policy, which posits
that (a) public opinion
strongly influences public policy and (b) responsiveness to public opinion
increases correlatively with a
particular issue’s ‘salience’
(ie the degree to which the public is aware of and cares about that
On a separate note, no conclusive patterns or correlations were observed in
relation to the response or implementation practices of
the federal government
and its political orientation (ie whether the Australian Labor Party
(‘ALP’) or the Liberal–National
Coalition (‘LNP’)
were in government). Our inability to make any such observations was in part due
to the strict temporal
parameters on, and consequently limited size of, our
dataset. For example, the fact that over half the reports that had a whole or
partial formal response to their
Corporations Act
reform recommendations
received those responses under an LNP government (64.52% compared to 35.48%
under an ALP government) could
simply be attributed to the fact that the LNP has
been in government for the majority of years since the
Corporations Act
Corporations Regulations
In addition, our analysis indicated that, perhaps contrary to conventional
assumptions,
reports that were commissioned or initiated and then subsequently issued under
federal governments composed of different parties
were more likely to receive a
whole or partial formal response to, or see whole or partial implementation of,
Corporations Act
reform recommendations than reports that were
commissioned or initiated and issued under one or more federal governments
of the same party or
However, due to the considerably different sample size of each category (with
the former consisting of 10 reports and the latter
of 42 reports), this variance
may simply be a statistical anomaly and, therefore, further analysis involving
significantly more reports
in the former category would be required to
conclusively establish any definitive patterns or correlations.
IV OBSERVATIONS
THROUGHOUT DATA COLLATION
Collating the data required for the statistical analysis in
a difficult and time-consuming process. This can be attributed to numerous
issues that we observed regarding the federal
government’s approach to
publishing, responding to and implementing reports that contain
Corporations
reform recommendations.
At the most basic level, the federal government has not provided the public
with easy access to all such reports. In particular, there
is no platform
administered by the federal government through which the public can access all
of the reports involving
Corporations Act
reform despite the fact that,
in many cases, the federal government itself commissioned the Reporting Bodies
to produce those reports.
Instead, these reports are only accessible on each of
the Reporting Bodies’ respective websites, which do not share uniform
designs or navigation
This makes ascertaining how many reports include
Corporations Act
recommendations, and assembling copies of such reports, a considerably onerous
Similar difficulties were also observed with respect to formal responses to
reports involving
Corporations Act
reform. There is no central repository
administered by the federal government that collates the formal response to each
such report:
this can create confusion among the public and the Reporting Bodies
themselves. Although some Reporting Bodies maintain registers
that record
whether a response has been issued to their reports, not all of these registers
are complete or correct. For example,
neither the President of the
Senate’s report on the status of federal government responses to Senate
and PJC reports nor the
ALRC’s register of the implementation of its
reports on its website (‘ALRC Register’) identify that the federal
government responded jointly to the PJC’s as at 31 December 2023 and
ALRC’s respective reports on litigation funding
Furthermore, the task of identifying whether a response exists is made more
difficult by the absence of statements made by the federal
government about
whether it intends to provide a response to a report or the deadline by which
such a response will be published.
In circumstances where a response has not
been provided to a particular report, the websites or registers administered by
the Reporting
Bodies tend only to mention that, for example, the relevant report
is ‘awaiting [a]
that there has
been ‘[n]o response to
that the ‘[g]overnment’s response is being
considered’
‘[t]here has not been a government response to [the relevant report]
Similarly, the federal government does not provide any consolidated records
Corporations Act
reform recommendations (or other reform
recommendations) have been implemented. Other than the ALRC Register and
CAMAC’s annual
reports (alongside the annual reports of its predecessor,
the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee), the Reporting Bodies
publish any materials that indicate whether the recommendations of their reports
implemented.
This means that ascertaining whether the federal government has implemented a
Corporations Act
reform recommendations requires
undertaking a comprehensive review of amendments to the
Corporations Act
Corporations Regulations
enacted following the issuing of a report to
identify whether those amendments mirror that report’s recommendations.
The difficulty
of this undertaking is compounded by the fact that even where
such legislative amendments are, in form or in substance, related to
Corporations Act
reform recommendations, the explanatory
materials for those amendments may not draw attention to this relationship. For
CAMAC’s 2008 report on external administration was not mentioned
in the explanatory memorandum to the
Insolvency Law Reform Bill 2015
(later enacted as the
Insolvency Law Reform Act 2016
(Cth)), despite that
Act implementing, at least partially, 7 of CAMAC’s 11
Corporations
recommendations.
This state of affairs — that there is no simple, practicable way to
access or reliably determine the federal government’s
response to, and
implementation of,
Corporations Act
reform recommendations — has
produced an environment of opacity. As explored below in
significantly (a) limits the degree to which corporate law reform processes lead
to the federal government adequately and transparently
engaging with such
recommendations and (b) impairs the efficiency of these processes with respect
to private and public resources.
V IMPLICATIONS
The federal government’s unresponsiveness, as evidenced by the
statistical analysis in
and the observations made in
wide-ranging implications for corporate law reform.
First, although the federal government has created and empowered the
Reporting Bodies to put forward
Corporations Act
reform recommendations,
there is evidently insufficient systemic and public impetus for such
recommendations to receive an adequate
response and be subsequently implemented.
This allows the federal government to effectively ignore the work of Reporting
Bodies that,
in many cases, is the product of significant and considered
consultation with industry experts and stakeholders and reveals pressing
in the existing national corporations law
When such unaccountability persists over an extended period of time, significant
legislative shortfalls can appear. The Senate Committee
raised this issue in a
2022 inquiry into the collapse of the Sterling Income Trust, noting in its
report that
the experiences of the Sterling investors are but another example in the large
number of investment products that have failed and
resulted in substantial
investor losses. Both this committee and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on
Corporations and Financial
Services have conducted several inquiries over the
last decade into failed investment schemes, the underlying regulatory regime,
and the performance of the regulator. ... While the committee notes that the
government has previously committed to review the regulatory
framework for
managed investments schemes, it is yet to formally commence this process. Many
recommendations arising from previous
inquiries on similar issues have yet to be
implemented and high-risk managed investment schemes continue to be ruthlessly
and then suddenly fail, taking ... [the] financial hopes and dreams [of
retail investors] with them. ... Overall, the committee believes
that there is a
clear gap in community expectations around the regulation of financial and
investment products. This is demonstrated
by the misalignment between
people’s understanding of financial products and how these products are
designed, disclosed, and
marketed to
a result of these findings, the Senate Committee recommended that the federal
government not only table ‘all recommendations
from all relevant
parliamentary and government inquiries [concerning financial service regulation]
since the global financial crisis
and the government
but also that
the ‘Australian Parliament undertake a review of the implementation of
recommendations ... and an evaluation
of the government responses’ to
those recommendations.
way, the Senate Committee recognised the significance of federal government
response to, and implementation of, the recommendations
of past reports for
corporate law reform and the issues that arise when such reports are not given
adequate attention. Those issues
can also be observed in relation to the
recommendations in CAMAC’s 2003 report on insider trading, which despite
being substantially
approved by the federal government in 2007, still have not
implemented.
In response to concerns over an instance of potential insider trading in 2014,
Ian Ramsay stated that legislative reform in line
with those CAMAC
recommendations was urgently required; he lamented that ‘[a]ll governments
for 10 years have been sitting
on 38 recommendations to clarify the law on
insider trading’.
Similarly, Juliette Overland has expressed the view that a loophole will persist
in the insider trading prohibition in
div 3 of the
Corporations
so long as the government fails to implement CAMAC’s
recommendations — such inaction invariably impacts the use and
effectiveness
provisions.
For the avoidance of
doubt, this article does not presume that all
Corporations Act
recommendations warrant implementation by the federal government. We acknowledge
that there are multiple factors that could
complicate implementation of
Corporations Act
reform recommendations (eg financial crises or political
transitions).
However, as such
recommendations are often conceived through comprehensive consultations with
experts and industry
stakeholders,
we argue that the
federal government should afford those recommendations appropriate weight,
consideration and action by, for example,
issuing a formal response to each
recommendation and publicly making efforts to implement recommendations that
have been formally
agreed to by a current or previous administration.
The second implication is that the federal government’s
unresponsiveness turns these law reform inquiries into an unjustified
public and private resources. Each Reporting Body is publicly funded and the
consultation, research, drafting and deliberation
associated with each report
that they produce involve significant
expenditure.
For example, the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption
cost around $45.9 million and the Productivity Commission’s
2018 inquiry
into superannuation cost around $3.46
Despite these
considerable public expenses, the federal government has not issued a formal
response to the
Corporations Act
reform recommendations made in either
Should the federal government not provide formal responses to, or otherwise fail
to actively engage with, these reports, the expenditure
necessary to produce
them has arguably been wasted — this would be particularly disappointing
given the federal government

The apparent willingness of federal governments to request law reform inquiries
and then ignore their reports is not confined to
these two instances: our
analysis indicates that 13 (44.83%) of the 29 reports commissioned by the
federal government have received
no formal response to their
Corporations
recommendations.
In addition, by failing to respond to or implement
Corporations Act
reform recommendations, the federal government duplicates the work that must be
done by inquiry processes on any given topic: the
issues that
Corporations
reform recommendations seek to address do not simply disappear when they
are ignored. This issue is clearly visible in the repeatedly
ignored reports
from the inquiries into managed investment schemes (highlighted in the Sterling
Income Trust inquiry) that have been
conducted by the PJC, CAMAC and the Senate
The unnecessarily duplicative content of these inquiries not only indicates
inefficient public resource allocation but also an absence
coordination between Reporting Bodies that may contribute to the low
implementation rate of
Corporations Act
reform recommendations.
It should be acknowledged that the expenditure on law reform inquiries could
be justified, even if their reports are not adequately
considered or implemented
by the federal government, by reference to the fact that they foster public
debate and place pressure on
the federal government to appropriately revise
Australia’s corporate

renewal’ fostered by law reform bodies is central to the rule of
However, the federal
government’s failure to facilitate easy access to a comprehensive
collection of all reports that contain
Corporations Act
recommendations, or otherwise issue an official response to and publish accurate
records on the implementation of these recommendations,
inhibits the capacity of
such reports to light this ‘flame’ by limiting the public’s
ability to engage with proposed
reforms and hold the federal government
accountable.
Private resources are also wasted when
Corporations Act
recommendations receive inadequate attention from the federal government. Like
the Reporting Bodies, the private actors who
make submissions in the
consultation process of a law reform inquiry dedicate considerable resources to
ensuring that their views
When action is not taken
to even respond to the recommendations of Reporting Bodies, the enthusiasm or
willingness of those private
actors to engage with law reform inquiries
diminishes: the federal government’s lack of consideration for their
contributions
discourages future
submissions.
Rosalind Croucher,
a former President of the ALRC and the Australian Human Rights Commission, has
highlighted that public consultation
and engagement with a wide range of
perspectives is crucial to upholding the impartiality, intellectual rigour and
practicality of
law reform processes.
Therefore, diminishing the number of voices that are willing to contribute
to these processes is undoubtedly detrimental to the ongoing
development of
Australia’s corporate law.
VI PROPOSALS
We propose two broad initiatives aimed at ensuring that the federal
government more transparently and efficiently deals with reports
that recommend
Corporations Act
Measures To Increase
Public Awareness and Accountability
The first initiative is to introduce a suite of measures to increase the
transparency of corporate law reform processes by enhancing
the public’s
awareness of, and access to, reports that recommend
Corporations Act
reform as well as formal federal government responses to, and records on the
implementation of, such reports’ recommendations.
The first such measure is to establish administrative and legislative
controls that ensure that each report by a Reporting Body receives
response from the federal government. Currently, there is no requirement for the
federal government to respond to reports
from the ALRC, the Productivity
Commission or royal commissions and there was no requirement to respond to CAMAC
While there is a
requirement for the federal government to formally respond to Senate Committee,
House Committee and PJC reports
within certain timeframes, these timeframes
(three to six months) are routinely ignored: consequently, the majority of the
from these bodies receive no formal
A necessary first step to addressing such deficiencies would be legislative
reform to require the federal government to issue a formal
response to ALRC,
Productivity Commission and royal commission reports within a specified
timeframe and, similarly to the practice
in the Senate and the House of
Representatives, to issue a biannual register that lists the reports that
require such a response.
It would be preferable for this register to collate the
relevant reports from
of the Reporting Bodies (including the Senate
Committee, the House Committee and the PJC) to enhance the public’s
to access and review the statuses of federal government responses and,
consequently, to hold the federal government accountable to
these specified
timeframes. This approach could address the apparent apathy currently expressed
towards the documents tabled in the
Senate and House of Representatives,
respectively, on the status of federal government responses to reports by
parliamentary committees.
fact, our proposed comprehensive register could follow a similar process of
publication to (and feasibly replace) these documents.
The federal government
would first agree to table a biannual report in both the Senate and the House of
Representatives that indicates
the statuses of formal responses issued to the
reports of each Reporting Body. The President of the Senate and the Speaker of
House of Representatives would then jointly table, in both Houses of
Parliament, a publicly available register that collates the
statuses of formal
responses in the federal government’s biannual report in addition to a
confirmation of whether the deadline
for each relevant report has been
A second but more difficult
step would be the introduction (through legislative or administrative means) of
consequences for a failure
by the federal government to deliver a formal
response on time — such consequences could be administered by a designated
committee of the federal
Parliament.
As Stephanie Gill
states, with respect to reports from Senate committees:
There appears to be no implications for a government failing to respond to
recommendations. For example, the list of Ministers that
have been censured by
the Senate does not include any instances of failing to provide a government
However, in proposing these developments, we recognise that the federal
government is unlikely to self-impose negative consequences
for its own
inaction. In any event, a measured approach will be required so as not to
discourage the federal government’s provision
of resources to the
Reporting Bodies. Therefore, it may be determined that once a collated biannual
schedule and a response deadline
have been mandated in line with our proposed
first initiative, there will be sufficient incentive for the federal government
that a response is delivered on time in order to avoid negative
publicity for failing to meet that deadline. Accordingly, our proposed
step may not be required in implementing this measure.
The second measure is to require that explanatory material for legislation
that implements (in whole or in part) a
Corporations Act
recommendation clearly references that recommendation. Implementation of this
measure could involve the publication and dissemination
of official guidelines
on explanatory material drafting that explicitly emphasise the need to ascertain
whether proposed legislation
implements any outstanding recommendations from the
reports of law reform inquiries. In addition, the standing orders of the Senate
and of the House of Representatives could be amended to require that Bills or
proposed delegated legislation can only be presented
and passed where their
explanatory materials include a review of whether they would implement any law
reform inquiry recommendations.
These actions would, at least, encourage the federal government (and all members
of the federal Parliament who otherwise draft and
introduce legislation) to (a)
substantively engage with
Corporations Act
reform recommendations, (b)
explicitly indicate the degree to which proposed legislative changes implement
or, alternatively, depart
from those recommendations and (c) incorporate such
considerations into explanatory materials accessible to the public.
The third measure to increase transparency of corporate law reform processes
is to develop an online platform that lists each report
that contains
Corporations Act
reform recommendations and was issued by a prescribed
group of law reform bodies. At a minimum, this should include the currently
operational Reporting Bodies. This platform, which could be administered by a
federal government body such as the Treasury, should
provide (a) an accessible
version of each report, (b) the federal government’s response to
Corporations Act
reform recommendations in each report and (c) a schedule
identifying the degree to which such recommendations, if accepted by the
government, have been implemented. This platform would provide the enormous
service of bringing relevant reports and their
responses into the public domain
so that they can more effectively influence the federal government’s
policymaking in both
the short- and long-term. This would be a considerable
improvement to the current state of affairs in which the responses to such
reports are not readily accessible by the public: Gill has stated that
‘[m]ost government responses to inquiries have limited
visibility, with
only the most topical being accompanied by a press release or spoken on in the
implementation of this measure would greatly enhance the public’s capacity
to access and connect with, as well as
monitor and hold the federal government
accountable to,
Corporations Act
reform recommendations in law reform
inquiry reports.
Establishing a
Modern CAMAC Equivalent
The second initiative is to enact legislation to establish a modern
equivalent of CAMAC. CAMAC was defunded in 2014 and legislatively
abolished in
2018 as part of a broader initiative directed at ‘abolishing some
government bodies and merging other government
bodies to reduce duplication,
improve coordination and increase efficiency in how public funds are used to
deliver services to the
community’.
However, the
decision to cease CAMAC’s operations was made despite public resistance
and spirited political
opposition;
an earlier attempt to abolish CAMAC failed due to insufficient support from
members of the Senate.
dissenting voices at the heart of that debate have seen some of their fears come
to fruition in recent years as corporate law
reform processes in Australia have
deteriorated.
Meanwhile, the calls of industry stakeholders for CAMAC’s re-establishment
intensified.
As has been foreshadowed by some commentators, the demise of CAMAC has left the
federal government without a highly specialised,
research-based and, most
importantly,
independent
advisory body that can consider and develop
corporate law reform
What remains is a
disparate collection of bodies that arguably lack either the expertise or
independence to consistently advance
valuable and timely contributions to the
increasingly complex area of corporate
Pamela Hanrahan has
argued for the establishment of a new CAMAC-like body, that will ‘act in
the public interest’, as
‘it is inevitable that future amendments
and enhancements will be needed as markets develop, and that the design of the
itself must be able to accommodate that without turning into
“legislative porridge”’: ‘there are [currently]
regulated entities and their internal and external service providers who profit
from and entrench the existing lack of clarity in
Moreover, centralising corporate law expertise in, and prescribing the
mandate for corporate law reform to, a modern equivalent of
CAMAC could enhance
the federal government’s capacity to respond to
Corporations Act
reform recommendations. By establishing such a body, the federal government
could reduce the number of corporate-law-related referrals
that are sent to the
multitude of law reform bodies on which it currently relies thereby reducing the
Corporations Act
reform recommendations that demand a federal
government response.
federal government should formally designate a modern equivalent of CAMAC,
should it be established, as the primary body responsible
for developing and
Corporations Act
reform recommendations. If this body was
placed in a position of authority in the corporate law reform process,
coordination between
law reform bodies could be streamlined and the issue of
duplication that was identified in
could be somewhat mitigated.
Furthermore, it is foreseeable that
Corporations Act
recommendations from an appropriately specialised and expert body could be more
difficult for the federal government to ignore
or dismiss than those from other
Reporting Bodies.
this would, of course, depend on the measures outlined in
implemented — the statistical analysis in
indicates that CAMAC
reports received the second-lowest proportion of whole responses and the
third-lowest degree of whole or partial
implementation among the Reporting
In addition, establishing a modern equivalent of CAMAC, which had operating
costs of around $1 million and only three full-time staff
in its final year,
could produce considerable financial savings for the federal
government.
Alex Morris, Diana Nicholson and Will Heath suggested that the initial budget of
$65 million allocated for the Royal Commission into
Misconduct in the Banking,
Superannuation and Financial Services Industry (the ‘Banking Royal
Commission’) could have
been better applied as long-term funding for CAMAC
which, they argue, was already equipped with the requisite expertise and
to consult stakeholders, review the law and produce the proposals
necessary to reform Australia’s corporate and financial services
Furthermore, should our
proposed modern equivalent of CAMAC have similar fiscal and operational
efficiency and a narrowed focus compared
to its predecessor, it would have the
capacity to quickly mobilise to provide advice on pressing corporate law
challenges, especially
in comparison to the bodies that have borne this
responsibility in CAMAC’s

criticism has been made in the context of the ALRC and its recently completed

regulation.
The ALRC took over three years to do so — this was arguably due, at
least partially, to its lack of specialisation and its
competing priorities as a
generalist law reform body.
The considerable duration of this inquiry illustrates a significant issue in
the contemporary corporate law landscape. As Morris, Nicholson and Heath have

It should be noted that the ability of a modern equivalent of CAMAC to

VII CONCLUSION
Akin to the mobilisation of the
in ancient Greece, the call
for a law reform inquiry and report is a longstanding reflexive response to a
perceived malaise that
offers the appearance of action to an often unsatisfied
In this article we
have provided quantitative and qualitative evidence that shows that the federal
government has been notably unresponsive
to reports issued by Reporting Bodies
that contain
Corporations Act
reform recommendations. We found that
40.38% of the reports included in our analysis received no formal response to
Corporations Act
reform recommendations, while 50% of the reports
have had none of their
Corporations Act
reform recommendations
implemented.
Our statistical
analysis also showed that over the relevant period (a) the likelihood of
Corporations Act
reform recommendations being implemented was higher when
a formal response was issued by the federal government and (b) that the
government was more likely to formally respond to
Corporations Act
recommendations when the relevant Reporting Body had a significant public
profile. We then turned to the administrative and
qualitative issues that were
identified while collating the data required for our statistical analysis and
explored how these issues
reflect on the federal government’s approach to
publishing, responding to and implementing reports involving
Corporations
reform. In the absence of a central repository that collates these
reports and the formal responses to them, we found that identifying
assembling relevant reports is unnecessarily onerous and that there are
significant difficulties in ascertaining whether a formal
response to a given
report has been issued.
addition, we found that there are limited materials published by the federal
government and Reporting Bodies that indicate whether
a given report’s
recommendations have been implemented and, even when those materials exist, we
identified inaccuracies in
On the basis of these findings, we identified two significant implications
for corporate law reform in Australia: (a) there is insufficient
systemic and
public impetus for
Corporations Act
reform recommendations to receive an
adequate response from and be implemented by the federal government and (b) the
utility of the
public and private resources that produce those
Corporations
reform recommendations is not being maximised. To address these issues,
we proposed two broad initiatives. The first is the introduction
of a suite of
measures to enhance the public’s awareness of, and access to, reports
Corporations Act
reform. This would include measures to (a)
ensure that each report produced by a Reporting Body receives a formal response
federal government, (b) require that explanatory materials to proposed
legislation incorporate references to the degree that they
implement, or depart
from, the recommendations in reports that contain
Corporations Act
recommendations and (c) establish an online platform that facilitates access to
these reports and the formal responses to
them and outlines any implementation
Corporations Act
reform recommendations. The second is the
establishment of a modern equivalent of CAMAC; we believe that this would
contribute to
Corporations Act
reform recommendations being more
effectively and efficiently conceived, received and implemented. While at this
stage we have limited
our proposals to
Corporations Act
reform, our
proposals, in particular the measures to increase public awareness and
accountability, may be applicable to other law
reform inquiries in
We consider the federal government’s current practices involving
reports that contain
Corporations Act
reform recommendations to be
manifestly inadequate and think that this has significant implications for
Australia’s corporate
law. We acknowledge that implementing change that
responds to this inadequacy will be difficult and we note the inherent irony, in
this article, of proposing reforms that are aimed at addressing an already
deficient uptake of reform proposals. A significant and
sustained commitment
from the federal government will therefore be required to depart from existing
reform practices and processes.
However, persisting with the status quo is not
an option — especially in this period of rapid and significant change in
Australia’s corporate landscape will not wait for the law to catch
It is thus important that
law reform inquiries are not dismissed as the
of contemporary
Australia. While law reform inquiries should continue to be mobilised as a
response to legal and economic crises,
the federal government must ensure that
the recommendations that are produced by those inquiries are highly visible,
given due consideration
and appropriately acted upon.

criteria in

under federal governments

However, despite receiving overall more favourable treatment, we note that

See Gill (n
). For the avoidance of doubt, the
‘documents’ to which we refer are those documents that are published
by the President
of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives
respectively: see generally
President’s Report
After the President of the
Senate’s report for a given year is published, the federal government
tables an annual report that
outlines the status of formal responses to Senate
and joint parliamentary committee reports: ‘Government Responses
Outstanding
to Committee Reports: President’s Report to the Senate’,
Parliament of Australia
(Web Page) <
https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Government_responses
archived at <
https://perma.cc/UZ8H-HEAP
>. Then, on
the basis of this annual report and any responses that were subsequently issued,
the President of the Senate tables
and publishes a report that identifies these
statuses and notes whether the federal government has responded to each report
a response is expected by the relevant deadline: Parliament of
President’s Report
) 3–11. That process differs in
several ways from the process proposed in this article. As outlined above in
Part IV(A), the
federal government’s report would (a) be tabled on a
biannual basis to minimise any confusion between the federal government
Reporting Bodies and promote transparency, (b) include updates relevant to the
status of reports issued by all Reporting
Bodies and (c) be tabled in both the
Senate and the House of Representatives. Furthermore, the register that would
collate the responses
identified in the federal government’s report, in
addition to any other necessary information, would be jointly tabled in both
Houses of Parliament and published by both the President of the Senate and the
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
However, this article does
not closely consider how this proposed body would be most effectively
constituted or operated. One option
could be legislation that establishes and
prescribes the membership, remit, powers and procedures of a specialised
statutory joint
committee. Adopting this legislative approach, through which
membership quotas would be legislatively prescribed, could ensure the
participation of both Houses of Parliament: see Elder (ed) (n
) 648, 650. It would also ensure that all
changes to the committee, including with respect to its remit, powers and
procedures, are
subject to the rigorous debate and transparency of the
legislative process: see at 653.
