SOLICITORS:
Allan Bullock Solicitors for Elizabeth Hitchcock
C Christensen, Crown
Solicitor for the State of Queensland
[1] Both parties
to the proceedings in the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission (QIRC) have
appealed interlocutory orders made
by Deputy President Hartigan concerning
disclosure. Elizabeth Hitchcock is the applicant in the proceedings in the QIRC
State of Queensland is the respondent.
[2] Ms Hitchcock
was employed by the State in the Office of Industrial Relations (OIR). She
occupied the position of Chief Adviser
Engineering Services Specialised Health
and Safety Services. She commenced that employment on 3 December 2018.
Hitchcock’s conduct came under question and an investigation report was
prepared by Mr Gavin Gleeson, dated 21 March
2023. That report concerned four
matters of complaint and Mr Gleeson found that all were capable of being
substantiated.
[4] Various
procedures then followed. It is only necessary to refer to the following.
[5] Based on Mr
Gleeson’s report, Ms Meghan Barry, who was then the Deputy Director of the
OIR, issued a show cause notice to
Ms Hitchcock directing her to show cause why
disciplinary action should not be taken against her.
[6] Ms Hitchcock
made submissions in response to the show cause notice, but on 24 August 2023 Mr
Peter McKay, who by that stage was
the Deputy Director General of the OIR,
issued a further show cause notice. There, he advised Ms Hitchcock, amongst
other things,
that he was considering terminating her employment.
[7] On 5 October
2023 Mr McKay terminated Ms Hitchcock’s employment.
October 2023 Ms Hitchcock filed an application in the QIRC seeking compensation,
including for loss of superannuation
entitlements.
That application
alleged that adverse action had been taken against her contrary to
Industrial Relations Act 2016
. Ms Hitchcock’s application for
compensation is listed for hearing before the QIRC on 28 April 2025. The
interlocutory disputes,
which are the subject of the appeals, concerned
disclosure of documents which were relied upon by Mr McKay in making his
to issue a further show cause notice and to terminate Ms
Hitchcock’s employment.
[9] It is common
ground that Mr McKay considered two briefing notes: one dated 11 July 2023 and
one dated 16 August 2023. After
considering the first briefing note, Mr McKay
directed his subordinates to obtain advice from Crown Law as to the disciplinary
he ought to follow.
(a) disclosed a redacted copy of the first briefing note;
(b) disclosed a redacted copy of the second briefing note; but
(c) claimed legal professional privilege over the Crown Law advice and did not
disclose it.
redactions to the two briefing notes were said by the State to be justified by
valid claims for legal professional privilege.
Hitchcock made an application seeking disclosure of the Crown Law advice and
unredacted copies of each of the briefing notes.
application was heard by the Deputy President on 8 August 2024. On
7 November 2024, the QIRC ordered that unredacted copies
briefing notes be disclosed, but that legal professional privilege was validly
claimed by the State in relation to the
Crown Law advice. Ms Hitchcock’s
application was dismissed, as it related to that
[14] The two
briefing notes, duly unredacted, were disclosed. Relevantly, the first briefing
note stated:
“On 8 June 2023, Crown Law advised that, in their
view, having regard to the nature and seriousness of the allegations against
Hitchcock, it would be open to a decision-maker to determine to commence a
disciplinary process in respect of them.”
[15] It can be
seen that the first briefing note refers to a Crown Law advice dated 8 June
[16] The second
briefing note relevantly stated:
“You considered the response
submitted by Ms Hitchcock and directed Crown Law advice be sought and provide
assistance in the
drafting of a Show Cause Notice – Decision on
Disciplinary Finding and Proposed Disciplinary Action, proposing a disciplinary
penalty of termination of employment.
During the considerations in providing advice, Crown Law sought clarifying
information from the investigator into this matter while
considering the
responses submitted by Ms Hitchcock. You will need to consider the information
that has been provided separately
to Crown Law by the Investigator which they
relied on in providing settled advice (
Attachment 2
On 2 August 2023, Crown Law provided advice for your considerations
Attachment 3
). You should consider that advice in your decision making.
In their advice, Crown Law included a recommendation that although the
Resource Delegation Manual October 2020 provided delegation for you to continue
a disciplinary process toward Hitchcock,
through an abundance of caution, you
should consider approaching the Director-General, Department of Education to
provide powers
through the execution of an instrument of delegation to make
disciplinary findings in relation to Ms Hitchcock which would ensure
can be no question that you hold the necessary delegation to make the findings
set out in the draft letter drafted by
Crown Law.”
[17] It can be
seen that a second advice from Crown Law is identified in the second briefing
note. It is an advice dated 2 August
2023. Also identified is a document
prepared by an investigator which was apparently provided to Crown Law.
Hitchcock sought disclosure of the two Crown Law advices and the
investigator’s document. When that request was refused,
she made an
application to the QIRC to force the issue. On 19 November 2024 the QIRC
ordered that:
(a) the State disclose the Crown Law advice dated 2 August 2023;
(b) Ms Hitchcock’s application as it relates to the advice of 8 June 2023
be dismissed; and
(c) Ms Hitchcock’s application as it relates to the investigator’s
document be dismissed.
[19] The State
appealed the order of 7 November 2024, which compelled it to produce unredacted
copies of the two briefing notes, and
also appealed against the order made on 19
November 2024, that it disclose the advice of Crown Law dated 2 August
[20] The Crown
sought to discontinue its appeal, but Ms Hitchcock filed an objection to the
discontinuance. On the hearing before
me on 27 February 2025 it became apparent
that Ms Hitchcock’s only objection to the discontinuance of the
State’s appeal
was that any discontinuance should be conditional upon the
State paying her costs of that appeal. After some argument, the parties
that the State’s appeal should be dismissed, and I should determine the
question of the costs of the State’s appeal.
Hitchcock, through her solicitors, had filed a detailed submission seeking costs
on an indemnity basis.
parties were content for the State to file written submissions in response and
have me consider the question of costs on the
written submissions and without
further oral hearing. I shall follow that course.
[22] On 14 March
2025, the State filed its submissions on the costs of its appeal.
[23] Given the
fact that the principal application is listed for hearing in about a
month’s time, I am anxious to deliver my
decision on Ms Hitchcock’s
appeal. I will therefore dismiss the State’s appeal and reserve the costs
question to a later
Hitchcock’s application to appeal alleges three grounds. However, only
ground 3 is pressed. Ground 3 is in these terms:
failing to give adequate reasons explaining why the principles relied on by the
applicant from
(at paragraphs 32 to 36 of the Applicant’s
Outline of Submissions filed 15 November 2024 –
Applicant’s Outline
(at paragraphs
37 to 46, Applicant’s Outline) were rejected or, alternatively, did not
apply to the uncontradicted and unchallenged
evidence adduced by the applicant,
such that privilege had not been waived by the privilege holder in respect
(a) the 8 June 2023 legal advice;
(b) Attachment 2.”
reference in ground 3 to “
” is a reference to the Court
of Appeal’s decision of
Hafele Australia Pty Ltd v Maggbury Pty
The reference to
“Attachment 2” is a reference to the investigator’s
Ms Hitchcock’s appeal
[26] The QIRC
found that both the Crown Law advice of 8 June 2023 and the investigator’s
document attracted legal professional
privilege. There is no complaint on
appeal as to that finding. The QIRC considered that the question was whether
the privilege
attaching to those documents had been waived. That was, with
respect, clearly the real issue before the QIRC.
well-established that legal professional privilege may be either expressly or
impliedly waived, and that an implied waiver
occurs where “the conduct of
the party entitled to the privilege is inconsistent with the maintenance of the
confidentiality
which the privilege is intended to
Hitchcock’s submission to the QIRC was that the disclosure of the
unredacted briefing notes constituted a waiver of legal
professional privilege
over the advice of 8 June 2023 and the investigator’s document, because
the briefing notes (in their
unredacted form) made reference to both
[28] The State
submitted, amongst other things, that the disclosure of the unredacted briefing
notes was effected in compliance with
the orders of the QIRC of 7 November
2024. Therefore, it was submitted, the act of disclosure could not constitute a
waiver of legal
professional privilege vested in the State. Ms Hitchcock sought
to meet that submission with two arguments.
[29] The first
submission of Ms Hitchcock to the QIRC was that by not appealing the order of 7
November 2024 the State had accepted
the correctness of that order, and must
therefore suffer any consequences of compliance. It was submitted that followed
judgment of Diplock LJ in
Fidelitas Shipping Co Ltd v V/O
Exportchleb
[30] Secondly,
Ms Hitchcock submitted, in reliance upon
that in some
circumstances the failure of a party to take steps to ensure the documents do
not come into the public domain may constitute
a waiver of the legal
professional privilege attaching to those documents. The two briefing notes
were exhibited to affidavits filed
in the QIRC and were also referred to in
written submissions. It followed then, Ms Hitchcock submitted, that as the
State made no
attempt to prevent the filing of the affidavits and submissions,
legal professional privilege had been waived (the
submission).
Hitchcock’s only ground of appeal is that the Deputy President failed to
give adequate reasons for dismissing the
submission. It is true
that the Deputy President does not refer to the
submission and
does not specifically explain why she has rejected it.
[32] However,
when the judgment is properly understood it can be seen that the
submission did not arise for consideration given findings that were made by the
Deputy President.
[33] There were
no submissions and indeed no evidence that the State had failed to prevent the
advice of 8 June 2023 or the investigator’s
document entering into
the public arena. Neither document was exhibited to affidavits and the contents
of neither document were
replicated in submissions.
[34] What was
put into the public domain were the unredacted briefing notes. The briefing
notes referred to the advice of 8 June 2023
and the investigator’s
document. If the briefing notes, by referring to the advice and the
investigator’s document,
did not waive legal professional privilege over
those two documents then privilege was maintained no matter how the briefing
came to be disclosed.
[35] The Deputy
President, in the judgment of 19 November 2024, referred to various legal
principles and then turned to consider whether
there had been waiver of the
privilege in relation to the two documents now in question, being the Crown Law
advice dated 8 June
2023 and the investigator’s document.
[36] In relation
to the advice of 8 June 2023, the Deputy President
“The reference to the advice under the heading
“Key Issues” does no more than factually state that Crown Law
an advice about the matter in the terms described on 8 June 2023.
There is no evidence to support a conclusion that there has been
waiver of legal professional privilege with respect to the Crown Law advice
dated 8 June 2023. Consequently, the applicant’s
application with respect
to the Crown Law advice of 8 June 2023 is
dismissed.”
[37] In relation
to the investigator’s document, the Deputy President
“For the same reasons with respect to my determination
of the matters under the heading “Key Findings”, the mere
to that material being provided and in the absence of there being any evidence
that it was considered and relied on by
Mr McKay, I do not consider that the
privilege with respect to the documents referred to as “Attachment
2” has been
[38] While, when
judicial power is exercised, reasons must (subject to statutory provisions to
the contrary) be given,
are no (subject to statutory provisions to the contrary) set rules which
prescribe the contents of the
The reasons, though,
must be of such detail as to fulfill the function of judicial
in light of the issues
which arise for judgment in the particular
[39] Relevantly
here, the function of reasons is to show the basis of the Deputy
President’s decision
legal professional privilege had not been waived over the Crown Law advice and
the investigator’s document.
[40] As the
analysis above shows, Ms Hichcock’s argument was that privilege was waived
over the advice and the investigator’s
document not by disclosing or
allowing those documents to be published but by disclosing or allowing to be
published the unredacted
briefing notes. Consequently, her case depended on two
things being found in her favour, namely:
(a) the unredacted briefing notes, if disclosed or allowed to be published,
constituted a waiver of legal professional privilege
over the Crown Law advice
and the investigator’s document (the first issue); and
(b) the State did disclose or publish the briefing notes (the second issue).
submission relates only to the second issue. However, if the
first issue is not found in Ms Hitchcock’s favour then the second
does not arise because it becomes irrelevant whether the briefing notes were
disclosed or allowed to be published.
[42] The Deputy
President has explained why she found the first issue against
Ms Hitchcock.
ground of appeal which Ms Hitchcock presses does not challenge those findings.
The Deputy President’s order dismissing
Ms Hitchcock’s application

those findings which are conclusive against her. It follows
(a) the second issue did not arise;
(b) there was no reason to resolve it, let alone give reasons explaining how it
had been resolved; and
(c) the basis of the Deputy President’s decision is adequately explained
by the reasons she gave.

must be dismissed. Orders should be made for the exchange of written
