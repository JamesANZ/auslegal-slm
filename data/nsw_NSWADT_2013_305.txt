Principal judgment
Joseph Paul Busuttil (Applicant)
Commissioner of Police, NSW
(Respondent)
Representation
- Solicitors:
Mainstone Lawyers (Applicant)
Bartier Perry (Respondent)
File Number(s):
REASONS FOR
Busuttil, the Applicant, has applied to the Tribunal for review of the
determination by a delegate of the Commissioner of Police
("the Respondent") to
revoke his firearms dealers licence in accordance with section 24(2)(b)(iii) of
Firearms Act 1996
(the "Act").
Applicant held a firearm dealer licence No 410079989 for categories A,B,C,D and
H and prohibited items 1 to 16 which had been
issued on 2 January 2010
("Licence").
Applicant was charged under section 39(1)(a) of the Act with not taking
reasonable precautions to keep a firearm safely and on
11 October 2012 appeared
before Burwood Local Court. He was found guilty of the offence but the charge
was dismissed without conviction
pursuant to section 10 of the
(Sentencing Procedures) Act
27 February 2013 (delivered 13 March 2013) the Licence was revoked on the basis
that the Respondent was satisfied that the Applicant
contravened the
requirements of the Act by not storing a firearm in accordance with legislative
requirements. It was also determined
that it would not be in the public interest
for the Applicant to continue to hold a firearms licence.
Applicant requested an internal review of the initial division and the decision
was affirmed on 26 April 2013. He subsequently
sought external review from the
75 of the Act provides for the review of certain decisions by this Tribunal
including at (c) the revocation of a licence or
permit issued to the person
(other than a revocation on the basis that the holder of the licence or permit
is subject to a firearms
prohibition order or an apprehended violence
issue for determination is whether the Respondent made the correct and
preferable decision. This is to be determined having regard
to any relevant
factual material and the relevant law: section 63(1) of the ADT Act.
Applicant relied on two affidavits dated 23 July 2013 (First Statement) and 6
September 2013 (Second Statement) as well as provided
evidence to the Tribunal.
Respondent relied on section 58 documents filed 11 June 2013 and statements from
Sergeant Michael Kynezos of 3 September 2013
and Commander Peter Armitage of 9
September 2013. None of the Respondents' witnesses were required for
cross-examination.
police and health records were also tendered.
his First Statement, the Applicant accepted that on or about 30 July 2012, a
firearm was stolen from his premises. He had left
a firearm (category H pistol
serial number A995548) unattended and out of his gun safe when answering his
front door bell. He continued
that on 4 August 2012, five days later, he
remembered that he had left it in a drawer but the firearm was now missing, he
stolen. After searching the house the Applicant states that he
'immediately reported it to police' but that he was unable to retrieve
footage as the footage was only kept for about 6 days before being written
also claimed that the firearm as stolen was inoperable as the firing pin had
been removed when he was working on it.
the relevant NSW COPS reports prepared at the time of the incident it is noted
that the Applicant reported the firearm stolen to
police on 4 August 2012; that
on 6 August 2012 he provided further detail including that it was a Foxtel
technician who interrupted
him while he was working with the firearm and also
that he remembered the firearm approximately 2 weeks later. On 7 August 2012,
the Applicant is recorded as having told police he had CCTV footage and was
awaiting a technician to download it and also that he
had his suspicion that the
person who stole his firearm was a tradesman who attended his house. It was also
noted in that report
that there was no evidence of this. A later COPS report of
29 August 2012, reports the dates that the Applicant was working on his
to between 30 July and 31 July 2012.
Applicant's First Statement also set out at some length his position in relation
to New South Wales COPS reports involving the
Applicant in the Respondent's
section 58 documents and why in each case these should not reflect on his
character. I have read this
material and the Applicant's position in relation to
it but do not need to rely on the material to determine this application so
no findings in relation to it.
support of his case, the Applicant pointed to the fact he was a barrister, had
undertaken investigations into the NSW Police Armoury
on behalf of the
Commissioner of Police and into the Royal Australian Navy and remained a 'fit
and proper person' for the purpose
of the Bar and Navy.
his First Statement, the Applicant also stated that he required the licence for
his duties with the Navy, namely maintaining their
arsenal of weapons. This was
refuted by Commander Peter Armitage in his statement of 9 September 2013 for the
Respondent. In his
Second Statement, the Applicant gave further evidence that he
did 'not take issue' with the statement of Commander Armitage but added
'having a firearms dealer licence provides him with credibility and a
qualification that has assisted him in some duties.'
his Second Statement the Applicant gave evidence that on 29 March 2012 he had a
car accident that subsequently caused him short
term memory loss which decreased
over a six month period and then resolved. He stated that a number of his
solicitors were making
fun of his memory loss so he saw his GP, Dr Graham Locke
who referred him to Dr Sharpe, a specialist.
27 August 2013, the Applicant filed a medical certificate with the Tribunal from
Dr Graham Locke dated 23 August 2013 which stated
that the Applicant
'... involved in an MVA on 29/3/2012 after which he developed short term
memory loss and was referred to Dr David Sharpe, Consultant
Neurologist. MRI of
brain was normal as was neurological examination. Symptoms of memory loss
spontaneously resolved over approx.
Respondent, without objection from the Applicant, tendered police records in
relation to the accident which recorded that the
Applicant attended St George
Police Station four days after the accident to report the incident, that there
were no injured parties
and that no-one was charged as each driver's version
conflicted with the other so the police were unable to determine who was at
Respondent tendered medical records of the Applicant, provided on the authority
of the Applicant. The authority from the Applicant
permitted release of all
records held since 29 March 2012.
only records from Dr David Sharpe, Neurologist dated 26 May 2010 and 12 May 2010
and there were no records after that date. There
was no record in any of the
medical files provided of the Applicant being referred to or seeing Dr Sharpe
after 2010. In oral evidence
the Applicant asserted that the records must be in
records of Dr Graham Locke were also provided. The last record included was of
29 September 2013.
the records provided by Dr Locke, was a letter from Dr Locke to QBE on 8 July
2013 which referred to the motor accident of
29 March 2012. It made no reference
to memory loss, rather to a 'whiplash type injury'. The letter was provided in
response to correspondence
from QBE of 28 May 2013 stating that it did not
intend paying for further physiotherapy services.
medical reports and correspondence including with QBE in the months following
the accidence reveal no claim or treatment of
memory loss but only in relation
to soft tissue damage or whiplash.
only record of memory loss in the medical files provided was a notation
associated with an appointment of 12 August 2012 with
Dr Edmond Cummins where
the Applicant was seeking treatment for mild pharyngitus. The note appears
unrelated and simply reads 'mva
last March - forgetful side of car -" No
specialist referral is noted in this entry.
entry of 1 September 2012 for a consultation with Dr Graham Locke notes the
reason for the contact as "cervical spondylosis' and
a referral to Dr Rodney
Allen. The report from Dr Allen of 31 October 2012 states that that since the
March accident the Applicant
had suffered many complaints including 'headaches
and memory change'. No further detail, follow up or treatment was noted in
to this issue.
an unidentified handwritten note headed Busuttil with various dates noted at
1/9/12 'Losing memory' and referral to Dr Allen.
I accept that these are Dr
Locke's handwritten notes although they do not precisely accord with the
electronic records provided.
Applicant also has a significant traffic history, details of which were provided
in the section 58 documents. They included five
speeding offences of more than
10km/h which were not disputed.
Relevant Legislation
underlying principles of the Act are
set out in section
3(1) of the Act.
These principles emphasise that firearm possession and
use is a privilege
conditional on the overriding need to ensure public safety. The Act
places strict restrictions on the issue and
maintenance of a
stated in section 3(1), the underlying principles of this Act are:
(a) to confirm firearm possession and use as being a privilege that is
conditional on the overriding need to ensure public safety,
(b) to improve public safety:
(i) by imposing strict controls on the possession and use of firearms, and
(ii) by promoting the safe and responsible storage and
use of firearms, and
(c) to facilitate a national approach to the control of firearms.
objects of the Act are similar in nature, namely:
(a) to prohibit the possession and use of all automatic and self-loading
rifles and shotguns except in special circumstances,
(b) to establish an integrated licensing and registration scheme for all
(c) to require each person who possesses or uses a firearm under the
authority of a licence to prove a genuine reason for possessing
or using the
(d) to provide strict requirements that must be satisfied in relation to
licensing of firearms and the acquisition and sales of firearms,
(e) to ensure that firearms are stored and conveyed in a safe and secure
(f) to provide for compensation in respect of, and an amnesty period to
enable the surrender of, certain prohibited firearms.
24 of the Act sets
out the bases on which a licence is revoked.
24(2)(a) of the Act
prescribes that a firearms licence may be revoked for any reason for which the
licensee would be required
to be refused a licence of the same
24(2)(b) of the Act prescribes that a licence may be revoked if the licensee
contravenes any provision of this Act or regulation,
whether or not the licensee
has been convicted of an offence for the contravention, or if the licensee
contravenes any condition
of the licence.
24(2)(c) provides that a licence may be revoked if, in the opinion of the
Commissioner, the licensee is no longer a fit and
proper person to hold the
licence. Section
24(2)(d) of the Act
provides that a licence may be revoked for any other reason prescribed
regulations.
19 of the regulations provides that a licence may be revoked if the Commissioner
is satisfied that it is not in the public
interest for the person to whom it is
issued to continue to hold it.
11(3)(c) of the Act
prescribes that a licence must not be issued unless the Respondent is satisfied
that the storage and safety
requirements set out in part 4 are capable of being
met by the applicant.
Sub-section
(7) of that same section allows the Respondent to refuse to issue a licence if
the Respondent considers that issue of
the licence would be contrary to the
public interest.
4 of the Act
deals with safe storage requirements.
39 of the Firearms
Act requires that firearms must be stored safely.
39 of the Act
(1) A person who possesses a firearm must take all reasonable precautions to
(a) its safe keeping, and
(b) that it is not stolen or lost, and
(c) that it does not come into the possession of a person who is not
authorised to possess the firearm.
(2) The regulations may specify the precautions that are taken to be
reasonable precautions for the purposes of this section.
41(1) of the Act
prescribes how category C, D or H firearms are to be stored:
when any such firearm is not actually being used or carried, it must be stored
in a locked steel safe of a type approved by the
Commissioner and that can not
be easily penetrated,
(b) such a safe must be bolted to the structure of the premises where the
firearm is authorised to be kept,
(c) any ammunition for the firearm must be stored in a locked container of a
from the safe
containing any such firearm,
and such other requirements relating to security and safe storage as may be
prescribed by the regulations.
Relevant Law
Tribunal is to make its own decision and there is no presumption that the
Commissioner's decision is correct (McDonald v Director-General
The Respondent has a discretion to revoke a licence and the relevant
provisions do not provide for compulsory revocation, as is the
case in some
other sections of the Act.
discretion must be exercised to promote the objects of the firearms legislation
and the discretion exercised in clear preference
to the public interest rather
than an individual's private interests:
Burrett v Commissioner of Police, NSW
Police Force
[2010] NSWADT
Act provides no explicit guidance on how that discretion should be exercised,
however the underlying principles as set out in
s 3(1) of the Act, make that
firearm possession and use is a "privilege that is conditional on the overriding
need to ensure public
Cusumano v Commissioner of Police, NSW Police Service
[2001] NSWADT
at paragraph
Tribunal stated that the discretion should be exercised in a way which promotes
the principles and objects of the Act. This approach
has been adopted in
numerous decisions of this Tribunal.
have been many decisions by this Tribunal that confirm that a firearms licence
is a privilege and not a right: see for example,
Cleofe v Commissioner of
Police, NSW Police Service; Alpha Intelligence Securities Pty Ltd v Commissioner
of Police, NSW Police Service
[2001] NSWADT
Bottomley v Commissioner of Police
NSW ADT 211
Keane v Commissioner of Police, New South Wales
[2008] NSWADT 68.
Responsibilities
of licence holders are of a serious nature and licence holders must not only
understand and comprehend the guidelines
and laws that govern them, they also
must act in accordance with them:
Wiltshire v Commissioner of Police, New
South Wales Police
[2005] NSWADT
controls on the possession and use of firearms are imposed in the interests of
public safety. In
Ward v Commissioner of Police, New South Wales Police
[2000] NSWADT
, the Tribunal said that in terms of public safety, "the Tribunal must be
satisfied that there is virtually no risk", while acknowledging
Tribunal could never be totally satisfied that a person would not pose any risk
to public safety.
Commissioner of Police v Toleafoa
, the Appeal Panel said at [25], in the context of the licensing
regime for the security industry, that the public interest is:
'... an inherently broad concept giving the appellant the ability to have
regard to a wide variety of factors in choosing whether
to exercise a discretion
adversely to an individual. As the possibility of refusing an application on the
ground of character is
dealt with elsewhere in the same section, it is
reasonable to infer that the parliament intended that the public interest
operate in areas to which the character ground was not relevant or,
possibly, in circumstances where an objection on character grounds
would not be
sufficient in its own right to warrant refusal.'
concept is invoked in order to "ensure that private interests are not the only
matters taken into account: to make clear that
the interests of the whole
community are matters for the Commissioner's consideration. The effect of the
reference is to amplify
the 'scope and purpose' of the legislation":
Aluminium (Bell Bay) Ltd v O'Connor and Ors
[1995] IRCA 540
131 ALR 657
, 681. In this context the public's right to safety must outweigh
an individual's privilege to possess and use a firearm or any financial
that might flow from license loss:
Huckel v Commissioner of Police
NSW ADT 347.
Lynch v Commissioner of Police
NSWADTAP 43
, the Tribunal Appeal Panel stressed the overriding public
interest in the need to ensure public safety in firearm use and possession.
the principal issue in considering public safety is whether there is a risk to
the safety of the public if the applicant retains
the relevant licence:
v Commissioner of Police
[2003] NSWADT
was made clear in
O'Donnell v Commissioner of Police
, NSW [2009] ADT 162
that the risk to the public is not removed simply because the firearm is not
operational.
intention of the legislature is apparent from the comments by the late Hon J W
Shaw, Attorney General and Minister for Industrial
Relations, in the Second
Reading speech on 25 June 1996:
"The storage requirements are strict as non-compliance can easily compromise
safety. For example, if firearms fall into the hands
of children or others who
are not licenced or trained in their safe use, accidental shootings can occur.
And it is crucial to make
every attempt to guard against youth suicide and to
protect family members from firearms accidents."
obligation on a licensee to take all reasonable precautions to meet safe keeping
requirements is a heavy onus. The Act
how firearms are to be stored and the Applicant did not comply with
those requirements.
is not in dispute that the Applicant contravened the safe storage provisions of
the Act and a condition of his licence. This was
a fundamental breach of the
risk to the public is that there is a stolen firearm in the community. I agree
with the Respondent's position that the risk to
public safety was serious and
that it is not in the public interest for the Applicant to continue to hold a
firearms licence
best case for the Applicant is that he forgot that the firearm was not properly
stored, that this was for medical reasons now
resolved and that the firearm was
inoperable.
Applicant provided no evidence as to the details of his interruption while
working with the firearm. There was no detail as to
who rang the bell nor were
they called to give evidence. In one of his early reports to police the
Applicant said that he was interrupted
while working with the firearm by a
FOXTEL technician but no company records were provided in order to clarify the
precise time and
day he was interrupted. There was no evidence as to the
surrounding circumstances involving the alleged theft of the firearm, for
instance which tradesman had been at his house during the relevant period,
whether there had been forcible entry or not or whether
other items had been
stolen. There does not appear to have been any serious attempt to ascertain the
whereabouts of the firearm such
as providing details of the tradesman attending
the house to police at the time. There was also no evidence explaining why if
CCTV footage lasted 6 days it was not available given the Applicant's
evidence that he found the firearm was missing on 4 August
2012, having worked
on it sometime between 30 and 31 July 2012, for example, within the 6 day
was no physical evidence to demonstrate that the firing pin remained in the
Applicant's possession.
do not accept the assertion of the Applicant that the medical records in
relation to his seeing Dr Sharpe were in error. The records
of each of Dr Sharpe
and Dr Locke are consistent in that there is no record of the Applicant being
referred to Dr Sharpe after 29
March 2012 in either the records from the
relevant period of Dr Sharpe or Dr Locke. The only record is in a recent medical
certificate
provided by Dr Locke. The Respondent asked that the Applicant's
medical evidence be treated with caution given that it was not raised
Local Court on 11 October 2012, by the Applicant in his internal review request
of 14 March 2013; nor in his application
to the Tribunal of 14 May 2013 nor in
his initial witness statement of 23 July 2013. In addition, the medical records
provided first
raise mention of memory loss on 12 October 2012, some 7 months
after the accident. On the Applicant's own evidence this was after
the 6 month
period within which the memory loss resolved. I note also that the first
complaint of memory loss was after the Applicant's
firearm licence was
not determinative, I also find that the traffic offences indicate a continual
disregard towards public safety:
Tannous v Commissioner of Police
NSWADT 116.
of his profession and other assertions of good character, I am not satisfied
that the Applicant appreciates the seriousness
of the licensing regime such that
he will comply with the safe storage requirements of his firearms licence as is
in the public interest.
these reasons, the decision to revoke the Applicant's licence should be affirmed
as the correct and preferable one. In view of
the finding that it is not in the
public interest for the Applicant to retain a firearms licence I do not need to
consider whether
the Applicant has a genuine reason to hold a firearms dealer
I hereby certify that this is a true and accurate record of the reasons for
decision of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal.
