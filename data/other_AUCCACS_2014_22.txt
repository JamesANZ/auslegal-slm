Aboriginality of Victim
Factors arising from Offender’s Aboriginal Background Considered
by the Court
The Court considered the social disadvantage of the offender as a
mitigating factor in sentencing. This included the offender’s:
Exposure to
drugs and alcohol; and
Alcohol-related
violence from a young age in a domestic setting. [33]
Appeal Outcome
Leave to appeal was granted, but the appeal was dismissed. [113]
At around 2.20am on 28 February 2012, a 70-year-old woman got out of her bed
to check the time. She shared her home in Kempsey with
her adult son and was
struggling to sleep in the heat [20]. At this time, the offender, aged 15 years
and 10 months [2], was walking
along the street with two co-offenders with the
intent of stealing a car [21].
The woman heard noises and turned around to see the offender climbing through
her window, which had been open but covered by a screen
[20]. The offender had
cut the screen with a knife, the blade on which was approximately 10 centimetres
long, and was holding it
in his hands as he entered the bedroom [21]. The
co-offenders ‘apparently’ kept a lookout outside [21].
When the offender entered the bedroom, the woman screamed and backed out of
the room [23]. The offender demanded her money and car
keys, which he noticed
beside her handbag near the bed and subsequently took the keys and cash from her
wallet [23]. The offender
then approached the woman with the knife held in front
of him [24].
The woman’s adult son, hearing his mother’s screams and seeing
the offender with the knife, fled the home [24]. The woman
tried to call the
police from the phone in the hallway, but the offender threw the phone to the
ground, straddled the woman and demanded
her to fellate him [24]. She struggled
and screamed while the offender sexually assaulted her and continued to demand
she fellate
him [24]. The sexual assault saw the offender insert several fingers
into the woman’s vagina and anus [25].
The co-offender called out to the offender as he straddled the woman and
rubbed his penis on her cheek [26]. As she refused to fellate
him, the offender
tore her nightgown and kicked her several times in the ribcage [26]. He then
left the house with the car keys,
money and the jewellery from the bedroom [27].
The woman’s car was then driven by the offenders to several places in
before it was driven through the fence and onto a basketball court at a
school [27]. The offenders were heard cheering, saying ‘We
thrashed the
car, let’s go burn it now boys’ and ‘Fuck the police’
[27]. The car was then set on fire and
abandoned as the police approached [27].
This fire destroyed the car and caused ‘extensive damage’ to school
The woman fled her home and called the police on her mobile phone [28]. She
was found cowering behind a water tank in her backyard
in ‘a state of deep
distress’ [28]. The woman was then transported to hospital and medically
examined [28]. She suffered
a broken rib and bruising to her right breast, left
ribs, knees, shins, upper back, wrists and arms, and abrasions to her upper back
and left knee [29]. The lacerations to her vagina and anus caused bleeding and
she informed medical staff and she had recently recovered
from anal cancer which
had increased the sensitivity of her anal region [29].
Swabs taken from the woman revealed a profile consistent with that of the
offender, whose fingerprints were also found at the woman’s
Upon being arrested, the offender was found to be wearing the stolen jewellery
[30]. When interviewed, the offender admitted
to being party to the
break-and-enter, stealing property and destroying the care but denied sexually
assaulting the woman [30]. The
inclusion of evidence in a brief on 3 August
2012, the offender entered pleas of guilty for all offences [31].

Sentencing Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background
of the offender and/or indicators of disadvantage
The offender’s youth, Aboriginal descent and ‘deprived social
background’ were considered cumulatively by the Court
The offender is the third youngest of eight siblings [34]. His mother and
father separated after 13 years of a relationship ‘marred
domestic violence fuelled by alcohol abuse’ when the offender was 5 years
old [34]. He and some of his siblings
lived with an aunt until he was 12 years
old, with supervised visits from his father and occasional phone calls from his
mother [35].
He then lived with a paternal uncle and one other brother as a
result of mistreatment by his aunt [35]. Around this time, one of
his sisters
with whom the offender has regular contact was killed after being assaulted by
her partner, left beside the road and
struck by a car [35].
The offender spent a brief period in a juvenile detention centre from which
he was released after charges were dismissed [36]. He
lived with a relative
before being housed in a children’s refuge for six months [36]. He began
using cannabis at 14 while living
with his uncle, also a cannabis-user [37]. At
this time, the offender also began drinking alcohol, which he subsequently
became dependant
on [37]. After living with his mother for a short time at 14,
the offender then moved to Sydney to live with his father while his
jailed for approximately three months for assaulting her de facto partner [38].
His mother also appears to have mental
health issues [38]. During this time, the
offender failed to comply with supervision by the Juvenile Justice ordered to
address his
drug and alcohol abuse [38].
At the time of the offence, the offender was living with his mother [39]. Two
of his brothers were in jail on charges of armed robbery,
related to their
alcoholism [39]. The offender stated that much of his support network had a
history of antisocial and criminal behaviour
The offender’s schooling was also interrupted. He went to five
different primary schools before being expelled from a Western
Sydney school in
Year 6 [40]. He was suspended on a number of occasions in secondary school for
rule infractions, verbal abuse, fighting,
bullying and stealing [40]. Although
the offender was enrolled in a program to address learning difficulties and
completed Years
7 and 8, there appears to have been a period of 18 months when
living with his father in Sydney when he did not attend school at
all [40]. This
‘disrupted schooling’ impacted on the development of the
offender’s literacy and numeracy skills,
which were assessed as
‘low’ by the Court [47, 50].
The sentencing judge, referring expressly to
R v Fernando
(1992) 76 A
[2013] HCA 37
; 249 CLR 571; 229 A Crim R 337,
acknowledges that the offender’s ‘deprived social background
operated as a mitigating
factor on sentence’ [67]. The circumstances were
considered ‘special’ based on the offender’s ‘age,
prospects for rehabilitation, and need for him to have access to educational,
vocational and therapeutic programs available in
a Juvenile Justice correctional
facility’ [67]. These findings were not challenged by the Crown in the
current case [67].
Relevant passage
‘His Honour . . . accepted that a young offender’s social
disadvantage may operate in mitigation of sentence including,
in this case, the
respondent’s youth, his Aboriginal heritage, and his exposure to drug and
alcohol abuse and alcohol-related
violence from a young age in family and
domestic settings.’ [33]
Grounds of Appeal
his Honour erred by failing to reflect the objective seriousness of counts 2, 3
and 4 in the sentences imposed for those offences,
leading to manifestly
inadequate sentences;
his Honour erred by failing to consider the protection of the community and
general deterrence, leading to a manifestly inadequate
sentence; and
his Honour erred in structuring the non-parole period in such a way that ensured
the respondent would be eligible to serve his
total non-parole period in a
Juvenile Justice facility. [11]-[12]
Appeal Outcomes
J rejected the first ground of appeal [102]. In consideration of the cases put
forward by the Crown, the elements of aggravation
in these cases were not
apparent in the case at hand. Thus, these cases were incomparable to justify a
finding that the sentence
was ‘manifestly inadequate’ [96].
Furthermore, his Honour was entitled to consider the offender’s youth,
and the impulse of his actions weight in affording a ‘just and
proportionate sentence’ [99].
J rejected the second ground of appeal [107], briefly stating that he was
‘in no doubt’ that his Honour was
‘acutely conscious’ of
both the protective purpose and rehabilitative purpose of sentencing a young
offender [105].
J rejected the third ground of appeal on the basis that he was ‘not
satisfied’ that his Honour structured the
non-parole period in the way
suggested by the Crown [112].
