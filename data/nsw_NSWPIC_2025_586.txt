CATCHWORDS:
WORKERS COMPENSATION -
Workers Compensation Act 1987
; applicant had
a previous spinal fusion arising from an injury; liability admitted by the
respondent; approval for further surgery
was sought for a spinal fusion in the
immediately adjoining disc space was refused;
substantial cause arising from the previous injury and surgery was found;
payment for surgery and incidental expenses was ordered.
DETERMINATIONS MADE:
The Personal Injury Commission (Commission) determines:
applicant’s previous injury and subsequent surgery are substantial
contributing factors, as contemplated by
Workers Compensation Act
to the deterioration of the applicant’s adjacent spinal segment
and the consequent need for surgery as identified by
proposed surgery is both reasonable and necessary.
The Commission
respondent is directed to pay the applicant’s direct and incidental
medical and related treatment expenses in respect of
proposed surgery in the
form of a right L4/5 endoscopic microdiscectomy to be undertaken by Dr Mobbs as
well as a lumbar brace and
A brief statement is attached setting out the Commission’s reasons
for the determination.
STATEMENT OF REASONS
applicant underwent a spinal fusion at L5/S1 performed by Dr Mobbs in September
2019. He now claims medical expenses in relation
to a further proposed surgical
intervention, being an L4/5 endoscopic microdiscectomy, immediately above the
site of his previous
spinal fusion, to be undertaken by Dr Mobbs.
respondent disputes that there is any causal link between the previous injury
and surgery and the proposed necessity for surgery.
applicant seeks a declaratory order for the payment of medical expenses pursuant
in the sum of $26,088.34 for the cost of and incidental to a right
L4/5 endoscopic microdiscectomy and a lumbar brace and a bio model.
The costings

respondent alleges that the applicant did not sustain an injury at L4/5 in the
course of his employment as required by
Workers Compensation Act
(the 1987 Act); that the applicant has not contracted a disease injury
at L4/5 in the course of his employment where his employment
was the main
contributing factor to the contraction of the disease as required by s 4(b)(i)
of the 1987 Act; that the applicant has
not sustained an aggravation,
acceleration, exacerbation or deterioration at L4/5 where his employment was the
main contributing
factor to the aggravation, acceleration, exacerbation or
deterioration of the disease as required by s 4(b)(ii) of the 1987 Act and
applicant has not sustained an injury at L4/5 where his employment was the
substantial contributing factor as required by s 9A
of the 1987 Act
PROCEDURE BEFORE THE PERSONAL INJURY COMMISSION

was no oral evidence
was no application to adduce oral evidence or to cross examine the applicant or
any other witnesses as to any factual dispute
before the Personal Injury
Commission (Commission).
following documents were in evidence before the Commission and considered in
making this determination:
(a) Application to Resolve a Dispute (ARD) and attachments, and
(b) Reply to ARD (Reply) and attachments.
The applicant’s evidence and submissions
respondent objected to the reports of Dr Dias of 25 September 2020 and Dr Conrad
of 27 October 2022 pursuant to Regulation 44.
Counsel for the applicant did not
dispute the objection.
applicant relied on the balance of medical reports annexed to the ARD, being
those of Dr Ralph Mobbs, the proposed treating surgeon,
and Dr Gehr, orthopaedic
surgeon, Independent Medical Examiner (IME).
applicant had previous surgery, a spinal fusion at L5/S1, in September 2019.
applicant has undergone conservative treatment in the form of inter facet
injections and hydrotherapy because he and his treating
surgeon were reticent
Mobbs referred to a fall at
hydrotherapy, and a number of possible pain
including a potential
non-union at L5/S1.
December 2023 the applicant began to experience severe right leg pain and
weakness with a reduced ankle reflex. An MRI showed a
disc herniation above the
site of his previous fusion.
an examination of the applicant, Dr Mobbs provided a further report on
January 2024
dealing with the onset
of new symptoms. He stated that the applicant had done well after the
intervention performed five years ago.
He noted that before Christmas he had
developed severe pain down the right leg with weakness of the quadriceps and
muscles on dorsiflexion.
He had a reduced ankle reflex. He walked with an
antalgic gait pattern and favoured his left leg. He stated that the MRI told the
story. He had developed a large disc herniation at the level above his previous
surgery. He concluded that as this was the adjacent
segment above the previous
fusion, that the issue was directly related to the previous surgery and it
should be seen in that light.
Dr Mobbs recommended a right L4/5 endoscopic
microdiscectomy.
Gehr’s was qualified to provide a report by the applicant’s
solicitors. Dr Gehr was provided with 20 medical reports,
eight scans and X-ray
reports and three reports from the insurer’s IME Dr Anthony Smith. He
provided a report dated 3 October
Dr Gehr concluded
“It is my opinion that as per the history and physical
examination and documents notes of his treating surgeon he does require
endoscopic microdiscectomy. This surgery is closely related to his injuries
which he sustained on 21 August 2019, which is
further history today was an
aggravation of the injury that occurred in 2018.
..............................
such treatment is reasonable and necessary given that he had successful
fusion. However, he has now developed a disc rupture above
the level of the
applicant’s counsel submitted that the applicant’s previous accident
and the consequent prior fusion are substantial
contributors to the need for the
further surgery proposed and sought declaratory orders for the costs of and
incidental to the proposed
The respondent’s
evidence and submissions
respondent has admitted liability for the applicant’s injury and has paid
compensation to date. It concedes that the applicant
is of high needs. However,
it does not concede any causative link arising from his injury, or his previous
surgery, to the surgery
proposed by
Anthony Smith, an IME who saw the applicant for the insurer, reviewed an MRI
report dated 28 December 2023 and stated:
multilevel spondylolisthesis with 1O mm of retrolisthesis of L2 on L3 and L3 on
L4, and 6 mm of anterolisthesis of
LS on S1. There is an anterior spinal fusion
at L5-S1 and multilevel Schmorl's nodes. There is multilevel loss of
intervertebral
disc space and disc desiccation. At L4-5, there is a posterior
disc bulge/extrusion, with this material seen posteriorly in relation

right L4 nerve root. There are bilateral
disc osteophytes complexes, with
moderate bilateral outlets foraminal narrowing impinging the L4 nerve roots. An
L5-S1 anterior fusion

L5-S1 anterior fusion is noted.”
Smith concluded that whilst the surgery proposed by Dr Mobbs might be indicated,
the pathology was unclear. He concluded that the
applicant’s condition is
a result of his underlining degenerative disease superimposed on
Schuermamm’s disease and not
any incident that occurred in 2019.
for the respondent referred to the MRI report relied upon by Dr Mobbs for his
diagnosis as a hearsay report. He submitted
that I cannot rely upon it in
determining the issues before me because it is not before me.
respondent submits that Dr Mobbs does not explain the basis for his belief that
the need for the proposed surgery is directly
related to the previous surgery.
He does not say why this is so. There is an insufficient explanation for any
causative link and
there are no specific circumstances particularised by the
applicant, or Dr Mobbs, regarding the worsening of the applicant’s
condition. Dr Mobb’s opinion should therefore be rejected.
respondent submits that the surgery is speculative as to success and that there
have been insufficient appropriate investigations
explanations.
CONSIDERATION
reject the specious submission of the respondent that the MRI report reviewed,
commented on and relied upon by Dr Mobbs cannot be
relied upon by me to
determine this application because it is a hearsay report.
Mobbs reviewed the MRI report. The extrusion at L4/5 is said to be clear. He
drew conclusions regarding the MRI as set out in his
report. It is open to me to
rely upon his review and conclusions in that regard as the treating specialist
surgeon and I do so.
accept the opinion of Dr Mobbs. I am satisfied and find that the
applicant’s previous injury and subsequent surgery was a
substantial
contributing factor, as contemplated by s 9A of the 1987 Act, to the
deterioration of the applicant’s adjacent
spinal segment and the
consequent need for surgery as identified by Dr Mobbs.
the reasons set out above I will make the findings and orders as set out on page
1 of the Certificate of Determination.
