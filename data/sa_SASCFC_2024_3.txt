LEGAL PROFESSION CONDUCT COMMISSIONER v
[2024] SASCFC 3
Full Court – Civil: Livesey P, Doyle and David JJA
Introduction
originating application filed on 26 August 2024, the Legal Profession Conduct
Commissioner (the
Commissioner
) seeks an order that the name of the
respondent, Ms Roxanne McCardle (the
practitioner
) be struck from the
roll of legal practitioners. The application is made pursuant to
(1)(a) of the
Legal Practitioners Act 1981
(SA) and pursuant to the
Court’s inherent jurisdiction.
practitioner opposes the application. The application is listed for hearing in
the Full Court at 10.15 am on Friday, 6 December
27 November 2024, the practitioner filed an interlocutory application and
accompanying affidavit seeking a large number of
Interlocutory application
orders sought by the practitioner
the Commissioner’s application is dismissed, or alternatively that the
proceedings are transferred to Queensland;
the alternative, the final hearing fixed for 6 December 2024 is adjourned to a
date not before April 2025;
the practitioner provide an undertaking not to practice in law prior to any
final hearing;
the Commissioner respond to the practitioner’s notice to admit served on
15 November 2024;
the practitioner has permission to issue subpoenas to the Commissioner, to the
Regulators in Western Australia, to the Federal
Circuit and Family Court of
Australia and to Elizabeth Nicholson;
the practitioner has permission to adduce further evidence in relation to Family
Court documents; that the Commissioner must
provide full disclosure to the
practitioner;
the Regulators in Western Australia must provide full disclosure to the
practitioner; and
Livesey P give due consideration to recusing himself from hearing the matter
further, due to apprehended bias.
advance of the hearing listed for 6 December 2024, it is only necessary to
address the applications to dismiss or for transfer
(proposed order 1), for an
adjournment (order 2) and for disqualification (order 8).
balance of the applications can be addressed at the hearing.
Commissioner opposes orders 1 and 2 and contends that there is no basis for
Adjournment
practitioner has applied for an adjournment. The chief reason for the
adjournment is that the practitioner has sought a large
number of documents by
way of various summonses and subpoenas, as well as a response to a notice to
admit, and she says she cannot
be ready to proceed on Friday without that
practitioner was directed to address in writing why this further evidence was
relevant having regard to
Legal Practitioners Act 1981
(SA), given the adverse findings made by the State Administrative Tribunal (WA)
and the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal
of South Australia.
practitioner’s submissions do not address these matters, and instead
attack the propriety of the conduct of the Legal Profession
Commissioners, their senior counsel, and others. This also forms the basis for
the application to dismiss. Some of the
applicant’s submissions and
assertions are scandalous.
application to transfer is based on the applicant’s residence in
Queensland, but overlooks that this Court, rather than
a Queensland court or
tribunal, has primary jurisdiction under statute and at general law concerning
the determination of an application
to strike-off a practitioner admitted by
this Court.
forensic utility, let alone relevance, of the further evidentiary material has
not been shown and no proper bases for dismissal,
transfer or an adjournment
have been disclosed.
hearing will proceed on Friday.
Disqualification
practitioner contends that Livesey P should disqualify himself from hearing the
matter on the basis of past matters his Honour
has been involved with as a
barrister. Specifically, the practitioner relies on the cases of “Mr
Peter Macks and the closeness
of that case involving also Mr Greg May against Mr
John Viscariello and the liquidation of the latter’s linen
practitioner asserts that there is a conflict of interest due to Livesey
P’s prior representation of Mr Macks, who on the
practitioner’s
understanding was “later prosecuted by ASIC and suspended from practicing
as a liquidator for a period
of time ... due to falsified document[s] being
provided to Mr Macks”, and Mr Macks’ “close proximity to Mr
and their joint conduct against
Mr Viscariello”.
practitioner provides no further explanation or details. Having considered the
application and the very limited material offered,
the proposition that the
prior representation of Mr Macks by Livesey P more than a decade ago gives rise
to the requisite apprehension
of bias must be rejected. In any event, the
applicant has not identified:
precise matter which it is said might lead the judge to resolve the
Commissioner’s application, and the practitioner’s
applications, other than on their legal and factual merits;
logical connection between that matter and the apprehended deviation from
deciding the issues on their merits; and
assessment of the reasonableness of that apprehension from the perspective of a
fair-minded lay observer.

criteria have not been established.
application must be dismissed.
applications to dismiss, adjourn and disqualify are dismissed, with costs
reserved to the Full Court.
