Standing in judicial review
Although the last 30 years have witnessed an explosion of administrative
review, Australia has not developed a culture of public interest
litigation. One
reason for this is that the rules of standing in judicial review retain some
restrictive elements that make it difficult
for representative groups to
challenge government decisions. The requirement that, to have standing, a
complainant must be able to
show a special interest or be aggrieved by a
decision does not equate with even the strong views or commitments of a
As a consequence, the
special interest test has yielded uneven results in environmental
cases—particularly for representative
bodies that seek to challenge
decisions concerning their local area. Sometimes the courts accept that such
groups have standing
; sometimes
they do not.
These disparate
results led one state court to suggest that some lower courts have ‘run
ahead of both High Court authority,
principle’.
Justice Kirby has
said the High Court should review the environmental cases in order to determine
the correct approach to standing.
Although the High Court has not to date taken up that suggestion, it does
appear that any reform to standing will have to come from
the courts. The
Australian Law Reform Commission’s repeated recommendations to relax
standing tests and to introduce more uniformity
in the various statutory tests
have not been accepted by
government.
As a result, people
seeking to vindicate their interests might have to navigate their way through
the various ‘interested’
or ‘affected’ or
‘aggrieved’ standards, depending on the statute under which a matter
is raised. This is
unsatisfactory and undermines moves to simplify access to
government.
A duty of consultation
The difficulties representative groups continue to face in the law of
standing are reproduced in the requirements for natural justice.
The rules of
natural justice do not apply to decisions that affect the public at large, as
opposed to individuals or particular
In the absence of any duty
to provide natural justice—in the form of notice of a proposed decision
and an opportunity to comment—it
is difficult for representative groups
and public interest bodies to participate in many decisions of broad public
importance. There
is, in effect, no duty of consultation on governments and
their agencies. One consequence of this is that administrative rights often
not extend to decisions of general public importance.
The United Kingdom has adopted a novel solution in order to manage the
increasing expectations of many people and groups in relation
to participating
in government decision making. The Government has adopted general guidelines for
consultation that apply when no
other procedures for consultation
Almost every government
department in the nation and many agencies now follow these
guidelines.
The effect of the
guidelines is that many decisions that might have a widespread effect, and that
in Australia would be categorised
as ‘policy’ or
‘political’ in character, are open to public comment as a matter of
course. No Australian
government has taken this approach, although some
individual agencies have done so.
Fair outcomes in judicial review
The High Court has declared that
Constitution
does not enable
the judicial branch of government to impose notions of good administration and
other normative ideas on the executive
government.
Under this approach
the courts may enforce legal but not other values in their judicial review
to the same constitutional limitations,
so their focus on reaching the correct or preferable decision allows them to
take account
of principles of good administration such as consistency and fair
outcomes. This is territory Australian courts cannot enter.
