Notice of Decision
I have conducted a review under section 49F of the

under the FOI Act.
My decision on the Applicant’s request differs from the Agency’s
decision and more information is to be released.

Reasons for Decision
Background to review
Applicant made a request to the Agency seeking access to the documents.
Following clarification with the Applicant, the request
Building Permit documents that show the rationale regarding two
rooms built [location] for the current dwelling on [specified residential
Agency identified 2 documents falling within the terms of the Applicant’s
request and refused access to them under section
35(1)(b). The Agency’s
decision letter sets out the reasons for its decision.
documents are:
(a) a letter, being pages 1 and 2 of the documents provided to OVIC
(b) a floor plan, being page 3 of the documents provided to OVIC.
Review application
Applicant sought review by the Information Commissioner under section 49A(1) of
the Agency’s decision to refuse access.
have examined a copy of the documents subject to review.
Applicant and the Agency were invited to make a written submission under section
49H(2) in relation to the review.
have considered relevant communications and submissions received from the
undertaking my review, I have had regard to the object of the FOI Act, which is
to create a general right of access to information
in the possession of the
Government or other public bodies, limited only by exceptions and exemptions
necessary to protect essential
public interests, privacy and business
note Parliament’s intention the FOI Act must be interpreted so as to
further the object of the Act and any discretions conferred
by the Act must be
exercised, as far as possible, so as to facilitate and promote the disclosure of
information in a timely manner
and at the lowest reasonable cost.
conducting a review under section 49F, section 49P requires that I make a new or
‘fresh decision’. Therefore, my review
does not involve determining
whether the Agency’s decision is correct, but rather requires my fresh
decision to be the ‘correct
or preferable
This involves
ensuring my decision is correctly made under the FOI Act and any other
applicable law in force at the time of my decision.
Section 33(1) – Documents affecting personal privacy of third
note the Applicant advised they are not seeking personal affairs information.
However, as the definition of personal affairs information
under the FOI Act is
broad, I consider they do seek personal affairs information. Therefore, while
the Agency did not apply section
33(1) to the documents, having considered their
contents and the Agency’s decision letter, I consider it is appropriate to
consider whether it applies.
33(1) protects an individual’s privacy where their right to privacy
outweighs the public interest in disclosing their
information.
This will only occur
when disclosing the individual’s personal affairs information is
unreasonable.
document or information is exempt under section 33(1) if two conditions are
(a) the document or information relates to the ‘personal affairs’ of
a natural person (living or deceased)
(b) disclosure of that personal affairs information is unreasonable in all the
circumstances.
more information about section 33(1) see the FOI
Guidelines.
documents contain personal affairs information of other individuals?
concept of personal affairs information is broad. Information will relate to the
personal affairs of a person if it ‘concerns
or affects that person as an
individual’.
This includes
information relating to health, private behaviour, home life, or personal or
family relationships of
individuals.
document will indirectly disclose personal affairs information if it contains
information from which any person’s identity,
address or location can
reasonably be determined. This means that a document can be exempt under section
33(1) where the document
itself does not contain personal affairs information,
but its disclosure would reveal personal affairs information.
affairs information can be revealed or indirectly disclosed by connecting or
linking the information in the disclosed document
with other information
available to the applicant.
am satisfied the documents contain the personal affairs of third parties, being

Consultation
Agency is required to consult with affected third parties, unless it is not
reasonably practicable to do so.
its decision letter, the Agency advised:
I sought the views of an
individual who indicated that the confidential information should not be
disclosed, as the material provided
to Council, was done so for the express
purpose of building a new dwelling. Additionally, the third party advised that
the release
of such information would compromise their personal sense of
security, particularly in relation to the Applicant having access to
the details
of their private residence.
Would disclosure of the personal affairs information be
unreasonable?
determining whether disclosure of the personal affairs information would be
unreasonable in the circumstances, I have considered
the following factors:
(a) the nature of the personal affairs information
(b) the circumstances in which the information was obtained
(c) the extent to which the information is available to the public
(d) the Applicant’s interest in the information
(e) whether any public or important interest would be promoted by release of the
information
(f) whether the individuals to whom the information relates object, or would be
likely to object, to the release of the information
(g) whether disclosure of the information would or would be reasonably likely to
endanger the life or physical safety of any person.
(h) whether the disclosure would increase the risk to a primary person's safety
from family violence.
have determined that it would be unreasonable to disclose the plans that appear
in the documents for the following reasons:
(a) while some house layouts or floor plans are available online, there is no
information that the one subject to review is publicly
(b) such floor plans can reveal information that the person to whom it belongs
would consider sensitive and personal
(c) I consider it likely the person to whom the information relates would object
to its release
(d) having considered the information provided by the Applicant, I do not
consider disclosure would satisfy the reasons for the Applicant’s
floor plan on page 3 of the documents is therefore exempt under section
have determined other information in the documents, being most of the letter
that is on pages 1 and 2, would not be unreasonable
to release for the following
(a) for the most part, the letter contains information about building
regulations and the role of the Agency. While this relates
to a residential
property, I do not consider this to be sensitive personal information
(b) I note the objection from the person concerned; however, I do not consider
the letter contains sensitive personal affairs information
(c) the letter also sets out a decision by the Agency that would be apparent to
the Applicant
(d) I consider the public interest weighs in favour of disclosure where it
provides transparency and accountability for the Agency’s
of the letter on pages 1 and 2 of the documents is therefore not exempt under
section 33(1).
I have decided it is unreasonable to release the name and signature that appears
on page 2 as there is no question regarding
the authenticity of the letter, and
the remainder of it is to be released. This information is therefore exempt
under section 33(1).
Section 35 – Documents containing
material obtained in confidence
35 contains two exemptions that relate to information communicated in confidence
by or on behalf of a person or a government
to an agency or Minister.
exemptions in section 35 do not apply to information acquired by an agency or
Minister from a business, commercial or financial
undertaking, where the
information relates to trade secrets or other matters of a business, commercial
or financial nature. This
more information about section 35 see the FOI
Guidelines.
Consultation
agency or Minister must consult with the relevant third party or parties who
communicated the information, before making a decision
on the request, unless an
exception applies, or if it is not reasonably practicable to.
Information
35(1)(b) – Information obtained in confidence
I have determined the floor plan exempt under section 33(1), I have only
considered whether the letter is exempt under section
document may be exempt under section 35(1)(b) if two conditions are
(a) disclosure would divulge information or matter:
(i) communicated in confidence
(ii) by or on behalf of a person or a government to an agency or a Minister
(b) disclosure would be contrary to the public interest because the
disclosure would be
reasonably likely to impair the ability of an agency
or a Minister to obtain similar information in the future.
Was the information obtained in confidence?
information was communicated in confidence is a question of
determined from the
perspective of the
communicator.
am satisfied based on the Agency’s consultation, that the information was
provided to it in confidence.
Would disclosure impair the ability
of the Agency to obtain similar information?
term ‘impair’ is not defined in the FOI Act. However, case law
(a) the degree of impairment must go beyond a trifling or minimal
(b) there must be an actual impairment to the ability of the agency to obtain
similar information in the
(c) it is not enough that individuals would be less candid than they otherwise
or would feel
resentment at having their confidence
(d) the necessary level of impairment will be made out if a significant minority
of persons in the relevant group would be firmly
resistant to providing similar
information in the future
(e) it is the agency that must be impaired from receiving information, not
simply a reluctance on the part of a supplier to provide
information
(f) the existence of a statutory duty to provide information does not
necessarily exclude the possibility that disclosure would be
reasonably likely
to impair an agency’s ability to obtain similar information in the future,
particularly where disclosure
might impact the quality and quantity of any
future information provided.
comparison, an agency will not be impaired from obtaining a specific type of
information in future, if there is legislation which
compels a person to provide
this type of information to the
am not satisfied disclosure of the letter would impair the ability of the Agency
to obtain similar information in the future for
the following reasons:
(a) while I note the factor in paragraph 36(f) is relevant, in this instance,
where the Agency has a regulatory role that members
of the public must engage
with, I do not consider disclosure will have any impact on it receiving
information regarding similar requests
in the future
(b) I do not consider the decision or the reasons for decision is sensitive
(c) the outcome of the request is known by the Applicant
(d) the builder does not object to disclosure.
have therefore decided the letter on pages 1 and 2 of the documents is not
exempt under section 35(1)(b).
decision is as follows:
(a) The name and signature in the letter on page 2 of the documents is exempt
under section 33(1). The remainder of the letter on
pages 1 and 2 of the
documents is not exempt under sections 33(1) or 35(1)(b) and is to be released
to the Applicant.
(b) The floor plan, being on page 3 of the documents, is exempt under section
33(1) and access is refused in full as it is not practicable
to edit it to
delete exempt information.
