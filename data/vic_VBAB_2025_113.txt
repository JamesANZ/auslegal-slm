of an existing dwelling on an adjoining
the extent that less than the required minimum area of the
recreational
private open space
has less than 5 hours of sunlight between 9
a.m. and 3 p.m. on 22 September.
(2) If a building is to be
constructed
the existing amount of sunlight to a recreational
on an adjoining
less than the amount required under subregulation (1), the amount of sunlight to
that area must not be further reduced by the
construction
the building.
(3) The report and consent of the relevant council must be obtained to an
application for a building permit in relation to a design
that does not comply
with this regulation.
(4) In this regulation the
required minimum area
recreational
private open space
is the lesser of—
(a) 75% of the
recreational
private open space
with a minimum dimension of 3 m.
- 4A(2)(d) of Schedule 2 to the Act states –
In reporting on,
or considering whether to consent to, the application (for a building permit),
the reporting authority—
(d) must refuse to give its consent to the application if the application does
not comply with any matter set out in those guidelines.
(the Minister’s
Guideline MG-12: Siting and Design of Single Dwellings).
Minister’s Guideline 12 (Siting requirement 12: Overshadowing of
recreational private open space) states –
To ensure buildings do not unreasonably overshadow existing secluded private
open spaces.
Decision Guidelines
The reporting authority may give its consent to an application for a building
permit for a single dwelling, which does not comply
with regulation 83
Overshadowing of recreational private open space)
of the Regulations if
all of the following criteria apply:
(a) the proposed building will not significantly impact on the amenity of the
secluded private open space(s) on nearby allotments;
(b) the building is consistent with a building envelope that has been approved
under a planning scheme or planning permit and or
included in an agreement under
section 173
Planning and Environment Act 1987
of the Act (Appeal –
Building Regulations
building regulations
leave a matter to be determined or
a person or body or confer a similar discretion on a person or body, the
land who requests the determination to be made, approval to be given, or
discretion to be exercised may appeal to the
Board against—
(a) that determination or approval or the exercise of that discretion;
THE APPLICANT’S STATEMENT OF CONTENTIONS (IN SUMMARY)
Applicant submits that when he paid the deposit for the subject land in 2021,
Regulation 83 did not exist, and construction of
the dwelling had not commenced.
further submits that the Council has not made a decision but has erred on the
side of caution so not to upset his neighbour who
is being unreasonable.
Daylight to the neighbour’s solar panels are not part of the
Minister’s Guidelines and is therefore
unreasonable. The neighbour’s
dwelling is not compliant with the Regs and is causing its own shadow.
the Applicant submits that any change to the design of his proposed dwelling
would mean that –
a) The initial deposit date would not be accepted;
b) He would need to comply with new National Construction Code regulations;
c) He would need to comply with the 7-star energy rating; and
d) His Builder, Fairhaven Homes, estimate the cost of compliance at least at
$120,000 which is outside his budget resulting in the
cancellation of
construction of his proposed dwelling.
THE RESPONDENT’S STATEMENT OF CONTENTIONS (IN
Shire Council submits that in assessing the Applicant’s request for
consent, it is required to have regard to the
Minister’s Guideline
MG-12: Siting and Design of Single Dwellings
and if any guideline is not met
clause 4A(2)(d) of Schedule 2 to the Act requires consent must be refused.
Council notes that –
(a) The required minimum area of Recreational Private Open Space (
under reg 83 is the lesser of 75% of the RPOS or 40 square metres with a minimum
dimension of 3 metres. The total area of RPOS provided
to the adjoining dwelling
is 76.5 square metres.
(b) Council’s site inspection confirmed that the actual side boundary
setback is 2.48 metres, not 2.2 metres as shown in the
plans submitted by the
Applicant. Therefore, the lesser required area of RPOS is 40 square metres as
75% of 76.5 square metres =
57.37 square metres.
(c) According to the overshadowing diagrams submitted by the Applicant and the
actual side boundary setback, the existing amount
of sunlight to the RPOS of the
Adjoining Property is 3.5 square metres under the minimum 40 square metre area
at 12 noon, 0.5 square
metres over at 1pm and 2.5 square metres over at 2pm.
(d) The extent of additional overshadowing of the RPOS on the Adjoining Property
by the proposed dwelling is an additional 11 square
metres at 12 noon, 9 square
metres at 1pm and 3 square metres at 3pm, being approximately one quarter
the minimum 40 square metre at 1pm and 2pm. There is no impact from
overshadowing by the proposed dwelling for the hours between 9am
and 11am or at
(e) The extent of additional overshadowing would be 3 square metres greater than
the above figures at 1pm and 2pm if calculated on
the actual existing side
boundary setback.
accordance with Siting requirement 12 of Minister’s Guideline MG-12,
Council was of the opinion that the proposed dwelling
will significantly impact
on the amenity of the RPOS of the Adjoining Property.
the Act Council must also have regard to MG-03 which states that if an adjoining
owner objects to the proposed dwelling, and
the objection is not considered
frivolous, the applicant may lodge an appeal with the BAB, but if council
approves the application
the adjoining owner has no right of appeal.
the two-storey dwelling directly behind the Subject Land has a first floor
offset further from the southern boundary than
the ground floor. There is no
reason why the proposed dwelling cannot be redesigned in a similar manner to
comply with the overshadowing
requirements.
response to the Applicant’s Statement of Contentions the Council submits
(a) The same overshadowing provisions existed in the Regulations as far back as
1994 under reg 418 and the regulation number was
simply charged to 83 in the
2018 Regulations;
(b) The Impact of the solar panels on the Interested Party’s dwelling was
not considered as part of Council’s decision
not to consent to the
modification of reg 83; and
(c) Financial implications of designing the proposed dwelling to comply with
overlooking provisions and 7-star energy rating requirements
are not matters
Council can consider in deciding an application for a report and consent.
THE INTERESTED PARTY’S STATEMENT OF CONTENTIONS (IN SUMMARY)
Response to Applicant’s Statement of Contentions
definition of recreational private open space has remained unchanged during the
relevant period and compliance with the Regs is
assessed at the time of
application for a building permit, not when a deposit is paid to a builder.
finding that “the proposed dwelling will significantly impact the amenity
of the secluded private open space of the adjoining
allotment” Council
provides a clear reason for their decision not to consent to the proposed
letter to the Applicant dated 31 March 2025 clearly states that it had
“received an objection ... which Council
does not consider to be
frivolous”.
Interested Party submits that since November 2024, they have proactively
party have been willing to
engage with them.
letter dated 31 March 2025 confirms that consent was refused in accordance with
Siting requirement 12 of MG-12, not
on the Interested Party’s
Applicant’s claim that the Interested Party’s “solar panels
are not part of the minister’s guidelines”
is not relevant to reg 83
and did not form part of Council’s decision.
83 deals with the impact of overshadowing by a
dwelling, and the
Applicant’s claim that “the neighbour’s own home is
non-compliant with these new rules, so they
are causing their own shadow’
is factually incorrect, and irrelevant.
Applicant’s references to impact of making changes to the design of the
proposed dwelling are not relevant to the Council’s
assessment and
decision under reg 83.
Relevant Background Facts
Applicant’s builder should have been aware of reg 83, either prior to
entering into a contract with the Applicant or the
applicant paying a
Applicant and his builder had ample time to be aware of the regulatory
compliance requirements and to address those
double-storey dwelling behind the Subject Land was constructed after the
single-storey dwelling behind the Adjoining Property
and was designed with an
increased first floor setback providing reduced overshadowing impacts on the
neighbour’s private open
precedent set by these neighbouring properties demonstrates that regulatory
compliance is achievable by the Applicant.
Alternative
Interested Party has stated that the Applicant’s builder has offered floor
plans which have similar floor areas, room counts
and other amenities to the
proposed floor plan, demonstrate that regulatory compliance is achievable, or if
not completely compliant,
would significantly reduce the negative impact upon
the adjoining property to a point that it would be acceptable, without
compromising
the desired home size.
Accuracy of Applicant’s
Shadow Diagrams prepared by the Applicant’s builder incorrectly show the
side boundary offset as 2.2 metres when the correct
measurement as confirmed by
the Council is 2.48 metres, resulting in overshadowing being underestimated by
at least 3 square metres
at 12pm, 1pm and 2pm which clearly does not satisfy
Siting Requirement 12 of Minister’s Guidelines
Amended Plans
Applicant’s amended plans relocate an upstairs bedroom to reduce the upper
floor length along the shared boundary by 3.4
metres, but due to the incorrect
side boundary offset, still underestimate the extent of the overshadowing, and
the proposed dwelling
remains non-compliant with reg 83.
of the Board’s Decision
the BAB overturn the Council’s decision, the resulting overshadowing of
the Adjoining Property will result in the loss
of clear-to-sky daylight access
to the primary habitable rooms (an open kitchen, dining and living area) of the
Interested Party’s
have considered the parties’ oral and written submissions.
determining this appeal, we stand in the shoes of the Respondent and therefore
in accordance with reg 83 of the Reg, we are obliged
to consider whether the
Applicant has complied with reg 83.
Furthermore,
the Act does not provide for the Minister’s Guidelines under s 188A to
bind or apply to the BAB. However, MG-12
is relevant to this Appeal to the
extent it is appropriate for the BAB to have regard to it in determining whether
the proposed dwelling
is ‘appropriate in the circumstances’.
find that the Applicant’s proposed dwelling as constructed will not comply
with reg 83 or satisfy the applicable decision
guidelines in the
Minister’s Guideline MG-12: Siting and design of single
the determination of the Respondent will be affirmed.
DATE OF DETERMINATION: 15 September 2025
Clause 17 of Schedule 3 to the
Building Act 1993
provides: ‘Unless the Building Appeals Board
otherwise determines, a party to a proceeding before the Board must bear his,
[their] or its own costs’.
