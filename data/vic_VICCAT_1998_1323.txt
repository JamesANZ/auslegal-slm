APPEARANCES
Mr Geoff Neil and Mrs Virginia Neil, Applicants.
Mr Terry Montebello, Solicitor of Maddock Lonie and Chisholm for the Frankston
Mr R Umbers, Development Manager, for the Responsible Authority.
Further submissions plans and photographs were submitted by the parties.
The request by the Frankston sub-branch of the Returned Services League of
Australia to amend the permit application was lodged by
its solicitors on 17
January 1997 and a copy of a title search necessary to identify the current
owner of the land was not received
until 28 January 1997. In the circumstances
it was not possible for the Tribunal to formally notify all parties to the
request that
it would be considered when the hearing of the application for an
Enforcement Order (Appeal No 1996/32290) was resumed on 31 January
The Tribunal indicated that it would proceed to hear submissions on both
appeals from the parties and if it concluded that an appropriate
should be made to Permit No 93/185 then it would inform any parties not present
at the hearing that a date would be set
down to hear further submissions.
However if those parties consented to the proposed amendment then it would not
be necessary for
them to attend the hearing and the Tribunal would proceed to
formally amend the permit.
At the conclusion of the hearing after hearing submissions from the various
parties the Tribunal indicated that it considered it
appropriate to amend
Condition 2 of Permit No 93/185 to adopt the amended rehabilitation plan
prepared by the Responsible Authority
on 3 January 1997. The Tribunal
indicated that the request to have the work carried out in stages with a final
completion by 31
January 1988 was not acceptable in the circumstances and the
Tribunal will direct that all work be completed by 30 June 1997.
As regards the application for an Enforcement Order the Tribunal indicated that
it would not dismiss the application as requested
by Mr Montebello on behalf of
the Frankston RSL but that it would further adjourn the hearing of the
application to 30 June 1997
so that in the event that the rehabilitation work
was not satisfactorily carried out by the Frankston RSL then Mr and Mrs Neil
request the Enforcement Order application to be set down for a further
Mr. and Mrs. Neil sought an order for costs against the Frankston RSL Club in
respect of the Enforcement Order proceedings. The
amount claimed was $824.15.
Mr. Montebello argued that no order should be made and, in any event, the
amount claimed was excessive.
The Tribunal will make the order for the amount
The circumstances of this particular case justify the making of such an order.
The Frankston RSL has accepted the benefit of the
permission granted to it
under its Planning Permit to retrospectively authorise the construction of its
third bowling green but has
ignored the requirements of the permit conditions
to carry out landscaping, drainage and other rehabilitation works. Mr. and
Neil were obliged to commence these proceedings to belatedly make the RSL
Club start carrying out these works. They are entitled
to an award of
