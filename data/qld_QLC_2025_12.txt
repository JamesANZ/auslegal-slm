Human Rights
Court must consider this aspect. The
Human Rights Act 2019
is addressed
in the joint submissions. The Court is satisfied that the parties’
agreement correctly reflects the legislative
position created under that Act.
The parties submit that –
The requirements of the HR
25. There are five steps in applying human rights under section 58.
(a) Section 58(1)(a) – ‘Engagement’: whether the
prospective decision is relevant to a human right (and which right);
(b) Section 58(1)(a) – ‘Limitation’: if so, is that right
limited by the decision. This is part of the compatibility
(c) Section 13 – ‘Justification’: whether such limits as do
exist are reasonable and can be demonstrably justified
(the second part of the
compatibility question: ss 8 and 13). There are two overlapping requirements
within this ‘step’:
(i) Legality: it encompasses both procedure and substance. Any limitation
must be in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law
(the procedural
requirements) and compatible with the rule of law, that is, sufficiently
certain, accessible and non-arbitrary (the
substantive requirement);
(ii) Proportionality: human rights, not being absolute, must be balanced
against one another and against other competing private and
public interests,
balancing the protection of human rights (which may conflict with one another)
and the need to limit those rights
to achieve other legitimate purposes.
(d) Section 58(1)(b) – ‘proper consideration’: even if the
limits be lawful and proportionate, the decision made
must give proper
consideration to the rights said to be engaged;
(e) Section 58(2)- ‘inevitable infringement’: if the Court could
not reasonably act differently or make a different decision
because of a
statutory provision or under law.
Section 58(1)(a) HR Act – ‘Engagement’
26. The relevant question for the ‘engagement’ step is:
‘whether the prospective decision is relevant to a human
right (and which
27. It is submitted that there are no human rights which may be invoked by
the decision to approve the amended PRCP schedule. The
environmental authority
and mining leases have already been granted. The PRCP schedule implements a
regime for the completion of
rehabilitation milestones which are already imposed
upon the Applicant in the environmental authority.
28. The obligation to act compatibly with human rights depends in the first
instance on whether ‘any of the rights are engaged’.
There is no
evidence that any human rights are engaged by the decision to issue the PRCP
schedule for the PRCP and the Court need
not consider the remaining four steps
under section 58 of the HR Act.
(citations omitted)
[13] The Court
is satisfied that there is no evidence before it that any human rights are
engaged in this matter.
[14] The Court
is satisfied, in view of the agreement between the parties, that the amendments
agreed by the parties are necessary
and desirable and satisfy the requirements
for the progressive rehabilitation and closure of the Lake Vermont Mine.
Land Court recommends, pursuant to section 190(2)(a) of the
Environmental Protection Act 1994
, that the proposed Progressive
Rehabilitation and Closure Plan schedule contained within the affidavit of Ms
Linney filed on 11 June,
2025 at page 197 to 239 of exhibit ASL-1 be approved.
Registrar of the Land Court is to provide, as soon as practicable, a copy of
this recommendation and the affidavit of Ms Linney
filed on 11 June, 2025, to
the administering authority under the
Environmental Protection Act
