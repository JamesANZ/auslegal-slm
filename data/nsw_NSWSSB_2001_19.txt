SCHEME : SP22784
ADDRESS OF : "..."
STRATA SCHEME SYDNEY NSW
APPLICANTS : The Owners Strata Plan 22784
RESPONDENT : R
APPEARANCES : Mr Le Page Solicitor for appellant; Mr Miller of Counsel for and
with respondent.
SUBJECT MATTER : By-law 17 (Mixed use scheme); Neon Sign in
1. The order made by the Adjudicator on 18 April 2001 is set aside and the
following order substituted.
2. The Board orders that R Jones, the lot owner of the lot containing suite 102
strata plan 22784 at "...", Sydney, remove by 5 October
2001 the neon sign from
the front window of Suite 102.
3. The Registrar is directed to return the
2.1 The appellant appeals from the orders of Adjudicator, Mr Phillipps of 18
April 2001 in which Mr Phillipps dismissed the appellant’s
application.
2.2 It was agreed by the parties the appeal was filed within
2.3 The appellant (applicant in file SA01/00119) sought removal of a neon sign
placed in the window of suite 102. In dismissing
the application the
Adjudicator concluded:
"I propose to dismiss this application
It is clear, having regard to
the hairdresser’s signs and the modernised front door, that the buildings
appearance is not absolutely
original. The concept of what is in keeping with a
building is always open to subjective considerations. In my view, although the
sign is apparent to the outside observer, it is not so obtrusive in this context
to be in breach of the by-law."
3. JUDGMENT
3.1 The evidence is this is a mixed case scheme. The relevant by-law, number 17
17 Appearance of lot
(1) The owner or occupier of a lot must not, without the prior written approval
of the owners corporation, maintain within the lot
anything visible from outside
the lot that, viewed from outside the lot, is not in keeping with the rest of
the building.
(2) . . . (not set out)
3.2 The evidence of Mr Edwards, Strata Manager was to the effect the building
was erected in two stages with the bottom half built
in excess of 100 years ago
and the upper half about the 1960’s. Mr Edwards agreed that suggestions
of an alternative sign
have been refused by the owners corporation.
3.3 Dr R Jones, the lot owner gave evidence that he was not aware that
permission was required for installation of the sign.
3.4 The only evidence was the oral evidence of Mr Edwards and Dr Jones,
photographs and the material in the adjudication file.
3.5 The Board’s findings arise from the oral evidence, photographs and
adjudication file. The building is reasonably uniform
in appearance above the
street level of the building except that one lot contains a neon sign in the
window. That neon sign displays
the word "DENTIST" together with a telephone
number. On the ground floor there is a modern illuminated sign over the
footpath and
further print signage on reasonably modern (in design) glass front
doors. Inside the foyer of the building where there is the entrance
hairdresser there is a six foot high bright pink impressionistic outline of a
human figure. The photographs demonstrated this
figure could be seen from the
3.6 The common evidence given is that the ground floor of adjacent buildings is
used for retail purposes primarily.
3.7 It is agreed the upper floors of "...", Sydney are used for residential and
commercial purposes. Mr Edwards conceded in cross-examination
there are neon
signs on upper levels of an adjacent building - the "..." Hotel.
3.8 No authorities were cited.
3.9 The by-law has a number of elements. It is common to the evidence:
3.9.1 The installation of the sign was without written approval of the owners
corporation;
3.9.2 The neon sign is maintained within the lot;
3.9.3 The neon sign is visible from outside the lot.
3.10 The question is: Is the sign viewed from outside the lot not in keeping
with the rest of the building. I answer the question:
3.11 Ultimately, I do not think it is relevant to consider other buildings
appearance. The photographs of adjacent and adjoining
buildings show different
building styles and ages of buildings. Furthermore the legislation requires a
consideration of "the building".
I have found the appearance of the building to
be reasonably uniform above the ground level. The neon sign provides a very
appearance. Keeping as defined in the Macquarie Concise Dictionary
"Just conformity in things or elements associated together"
building is consistent in its appearance other than the ground floor. The neon
sign in the window of suite 102 provides a
very different appearance than to
that of the windows of other lots facing "..." Street. Reasonable uniformity is
retained with
the alterations seen at ground level as compared with everything
above which bears a uniform appearance.
3.12 The appellant contends the Adjudicator fell into error by exercising a
discretion not to make the original order. I do not
read the judgement that
way. The Adjudicator basically found the building’s appearance was not
original; the issue subjective
and the sign not sufficiently obtrusive to be in
breach of the by-law. The Adjudicator simply did not find the breach of the
proved on the evidence.
3.13 The Board heard this appeal as a
hearing. As such the
appellant is not required to prove the Adjudicator fell into error. The
appellant is required to discharge
the evidentiary onus at this hearing by
proving the by-law has been breached.
3.14 I do not agree with the Adjudicator because he has failed to distinguish
there are two distinct aspects of the appearance of
the building: The appearance
at ground level and that above which is reasonably uniform.
3.16 I disagree with the Adjudicator’s conclusion the sign is not
obtrusive. The neon sign is "showy; undesirably obvious"
(Macquarie Concise
Dictionary definition of obtrusive) when compared to the appearance of the rest
of the building above the ground
floor. Should the reverse be found then there
could be lights in all windows. The appearance of the building would be
irrevocably
changed. A neon sign in a window has a very different appearance to
an adjacent window with no illuminated sign showing.
3.17. For the foregoing reasons the appeal is allowed. The appellant is entitled
to the relief declined by the Adjudicator. I so
