COMPLAINANTS: Gavin Ankin
Reggie Bara
Marcus Cameron
Stanley Kerr
Clarence Mamarika
Desmond Mamarika
RESPONDENT: Northern Territory of Australia
TRIBUNAL: Steve Southwood QC
Hearing Commissioner
ISSUE: Application to strike out parts of Complainants’ Proposed
Further Points of Claim
DATE OF HEARING: 24 April 2001
DATE OF DECISION: 3 May
REASONS FOR DECISION
1. On 24 April 2001 the Respondent made an application to strike out certain
parts of the Complainants’ Proposed Further Points
of Claim (“the
Claims”) filed on 27 March 2001 on the grounds that:
1.1. the Claims pleaded prohibited conduct which went beyond the prohibited
conduct alleged in the original complaints made by each
of the Complainants;
1.2. the Complainants had not obtained leave to amend their respective
complaints to plead the prohibited conduct which went beyond
their original
complaints;
1.3. unless an amendment to the original complaints was granted a Hearing
Commissioner has no jurisdiction to hear the additional
matters of prohibited
conduct sought to be pleaded in the Claims;
1.4. leave to amend cannot be granted by a Hearing Commissioner if the proposed
amendment is of such a nature as to amount to a new
complaint or an additional
2. In particular the Respondent objected to the allegations of events after the
date the original complaint was lodged which are
contained in the following
paragraphs of each of the following Claims:
2.1 Ankin - paragraphs 5, 14(b) and 16(b) (25 August
2.2 Bara - paragraphs 5 and 15(b);
2.3 Cameron - paragraphs 5, 8, 14 and 16 (events after 7 July
2.4 Kerr - paragraphs 5, 8, 14 and 16 (events after 6 July
2.5 Clarence Mamarika - paragraphs 5, 8, 14 and 16 (events after 6 July
2.6 Desmond Mamarika - paragraphs 5 and 14 (events after 22 September
3. The filing of the Claims followed directions I made on 13 March 2001. The
purpose of the directions was to try and narrow the
issues between the parties
and achieve a prompt hearing of the substantial merits of the
4. On 24 April 2001 the Complainants also sought leave to amend their respective
complaints. Ankin, Cameron, Kerr, Mamarika and
Mamarika sought leave to plead
a new paragraph 13 in their Claims and Bara sought leave to plead a new
paragraph 14. Each of the
proposed amendments made allegations of indirect
discrimination. The Complainants did not otherwise seek to amend their
complaints.
5. During the course of argument Counsel for the Complainant, Mr Sheldon,
conceded the proposed pleading of indirect discrimination
contained in
paragraphs numbered 13 in the Claims of Ankin, Cameron, Kerr, Mamarika and
Mamarika and numbered 14 in the Claim of
Bara as currently drafted were
misconceived. Consequently, I dismissed the Complainants’ application to
amend their complaints.
Mr Sheldon stated that he would replead either
paragraph 10 or paragraph 13 of the Claims so as to raise the issues the
Complainants
wished to raise in such a manner as to comply with the Act. He has
foreshadowed that it may be necessary to make a further application
to amend the
complaints.
6. In support of its strike out applications the Respondent relied, inter alia,
on the decisions of the New South Wales Supreme Court
MacDonald v
Puplick & Ors
Matter No 30090/97
(1998) NSWSC 428
(12 June 1998) and
of the Federal Court of Australia in
Charles v Fuji Xerox Australia Pty
(2000) FCA 1531
(30 October 2000). Those decisions are authority
for the proposition that without an amendment to a complaint a Complainant
allege, at the hearing of a complaint, acts of prohibited conduct not
alleged in the original complaint.
7. Arguably, the principles stated in the above authorities are applicable to
Anti-Discrimination Act (NT)
(“the Act”).
8. Sections 60, 63 and 64 of the Act provide in substance
8.1 a person aggrieved by prohibited conduct may make a complaint to the
Commissioner;
8.2 a complaint may contain more than one allegation of prohibited
8.3 a complaint shall be in writing and
shall set out in detail the alleged
prohibited conduct
9. Sections 66 and 70 of the Act provide:
9.1 the Commissioner shall, not later than 60 days after receiving a complaint,
accept or reject
the complaint
and shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, notify the complainant of the
9.2 where a complaint is accepted under Section 66, the Commissioner shall
notify the Respondent in writing of the substance of
10. If a complaint is accepted the Commissioner is required to carry out an
investigation of
the alleged
prohibited conduct (see s 74). At the
conclusion of an investigation and provided that he is satisfied that there is
prima facie
evidence to substantiate
the allegation
of prohibited conduct
in the complaint
the Commissioner may proceed to conciliation or a
hearing if the Commissioner believes the matter cannot be resolved by
conciliation
(see s 76). If the attempt at conciliation does not succeed the
Commissioner shall conduct a hearing of
a complaint
11. However, none of the above provisions precludes a complaint being amended in
the 60 day period prior to its acceptance. Nor
do they preclude a complaint
being amended prior to the Respondent being notified of the substance of the
complaint. Indeed s 64(2)
of the Act contemplates such amendments may be made.
12. It is also important to note that s 63 provides that a complaint may contain
more than one allegation of prohibited conduct.
Further, no process in the
nature of investigation, conciliation or hearing is embarked upon by a
Commissioner until the complaint
is accepted.
13. A practise appears to have developed within the Anti-Discrimination
Commission whereby the form of complaints may be amended
or, in effect, settled
by a Commissioner prior to their acceptance. Such a process would appear to be
consistent with the above
provisions. Further, the definition of complaint is
wider than the definitions considered in the above authorities. In Section
the Act a complaint is defined to “means a complaint made under Part 6".
The definition clearly encompasses amended complaints.
14. A complaint may be amended prior to being accepted and prior to notification
being given to a Respondent.
15. Nonetheless, there is also some force in the argument that a complaint
should not be amended at the hearing stage if the nature
of the amendment is to
add a complaint about other or additional prohibited conduct and where the
affect of the late amendment may
be to deprive the Respondent of the opportunity
of having the additional complaint investigated and conciliated.
16. So far as the objections taken in relation to the Claims here are concerned,
it is apparent most of the matters objected to were
incorporated in the
complaints prior to or at the time of acceptance. Many of the events objected
to were certainly incorporated
in the complaints prior to notification and
investigation.
17. To the extent that the complaints have been impliedly amended to include the
events sought to be struck out prior to acceptance
and notification to the
Respondent and have been the subject of investigation the Respondent’s
strike out application is refused
as the Act contemplates that such a process
18. As to the Complaint of Ankin, paragraph 13 is struck out as are the words
“and 25 August 1999" appearing in paragraph 14(b).
The complaint was
accepted on 4 October 1999 and notice of the complaint was given to the Chief
Minister of the Northern Territory
on 5 October 1999.
19. As to the claim of Bara, his complaint was accepted on 4 November 1999 and
notice of the complaint was given to the Solicitor
for the Northern Territory on
14 February 2000. Prior to the claim being accepted details of events and
prohibited conduct covering
the period from 18 March 1999 to 21 May 1999 were
provided. There was no complaint of prohibited conduct beyond 21 May 1999.
Consequently:
19.1 the words “and 12 June 1999" are struck out of paragraph
19.2 paragraph 14 is struck out;
19.3 the words “and 12 June 1999" are struck out of paragraph
20. As to the Claim of Cameron, that claim was accepted on 25 August 1999 and
notice was given to the Chief Minister of the Northern
Territory on 14 February
2000. The notification refers to prohibited conduct in the period 5 to 12 July
1999. Paragraph 13 of the
Claim is struck out. No other parts of the Claim are
struck out.
21. As to the Claim of Kerr, the complaint was accepted on 16 July 1999.
Notification of the complaint was given to the Chief Minister
on 29 July 1999.
The notification refers to prohibited conduct occurring between 2 July 1999 and
16 July 1999. Paragraph 13 of
the Claim is struck out as are the words
“and 20 July 1999" in paragraph 14(b).
22. As to the complaint of Clarence Mamarika, the complaint was accepted on 16
July 1999 and notification was given to the Chief
Minister on 29 July 1999. The
notification covers prohibited conduct between the period 2 July 1999 and 16
July 1999. Paragraph
13 is struck out as are the words “and 20 July 1999"
in paragraph 14(b).
23. As to the complaint of Desmond Mamarika, the complaint was accepted on 4
November 1999 and notice of the complaint was given
to the Solicitor for the
Northern Territory on 14 February 2000. The notification of the complaint
covers prohibited conduct between
18 March 1999 and 21 May 1999. Paragraph 13
of the Claim is struck out.
23. Save for the parts of the Complainants’ Claims struck out above, the
Respondent’s application is dismissed.
24. The parties will note that I have not struck out certain consequential
allegations which have been pleaded by the Complainants
and which do not amount
to allegations of additional prohibited conduct. Those matters not struck out
will form part of the substantive
hearing in July 2001. They are essentially
matters dealing with what is said to be the consequence of the prohibited
conduct complained
of by the Complainants.
