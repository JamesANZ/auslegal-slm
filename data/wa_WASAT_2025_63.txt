FOR DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL
Introduction
dispute between the applicant, Mr Ivan Basich and the respondent, T & H
Nominees Pty Ltd, which trades as Phoenix Patios,
has a long history.
concerns a patio which was constructed by the respondent at the applicant's
property in Spearwood in February 2018 for the price
of $11,850.00.
applicant lodged a complaint with the Building Commissioner that the respondent
had breached the contract between them dated
30 November 2017
) for the supply and installation of a patio at the applicant's
property in Spearwood (
HBWC Complaint
Building Commissioner referred the HBWC Complaint to the Tribunal pursuant to
Building Services (Complaint Resolution and Administration)
), which became Matter Number CC 699 of 2022
original proceeding
a final hearing, pursuant to s 43(1)(b) of the BSCRA Act, the
decline to make a HBWC remedy order against the respondent and dismissed the
HBWC complaint (
Dismissal Decision
applicant commenced this proceeding (
review proceeding
) by an application
to the Tribunal pursuant to s 58(2) of the BSCRA Act for review of the Dismissal
Decision and following a hearing
applicant leave to review the Dismissal Decision, limited to the issue of
whether the respondent had breached the Contract
by not obtaining approval
from the City of Cockburn for the works carried out by the respondent under the
the constructed patio
Subsequently,
the respondent conceded that it breached the Contract by not obtaining approval
from the City of Cockburn for the constructed
breach of the
the result of that concession, the issue remaining to be determined by the
Tribunal was what loss or damage the applicant had
suffered by reason of the
breach of the Contract and, consequently, what HBWC remedy order the Tribunal
should make under s 43(1)(a)
and s 41(2) of the BSCRA Act to
compensate the applicant for that loss or damage.
Subsequently,
the respondent raised the issue of whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to
determine the matter. There were two aspects
of that issue. First, whether the
HBWC Complaint was properly made to the Building Commissioner. Secondly,
whether the HBWC Complaint
was made to the Building Commissioner within
a final hearing on 26 and 27 March 2025, the
decided that
it had jurisdiction to determine the matter and made a HBWC remedy order
pursuant to s 43(1)(a) and s 41(2)(d) of the
BSCRA Act that the
respondent pay the amount of $233.30 to the applicant as compensation for the
breach of the Contract. The reasons
for that decision were delivered and
published on 3 July 2025 in
Bacich and T & H Nominees Pty Ltd
[2025] WASAT 63
the Review Decision
). The reason for the applicant
being awarded such a small amount of compensation was that the Tribunal
concluded that the applicant
had not taken all reasonable steps to mitigate his
that decision each party has made an application for costs and filed submissions
in opposition to the other party's costs
application and the costs applications
have been determined on the documents by the Tribunal, constituted by Senior
Member Aitken,
pursuant to
State Administrative Tribunal Act
the reasons which follow, I have decided to dismiss each party's costs
application.
The applicant's costs application
applicant filed his costs application on 17 July 2025, in which he is seeking
the following costs:
application fee' of $238.00;
'Reimbursement
of application fee for appeal' of $635.00;
'Reimbursement
of transcript fee' of $436.50;
'Reimbursement
of legal costs' of $28,877.83;
'Reimbursement
of engineer's report [fee]' of $9,332.07;
Taylor Consulting (Engineer) [fees]' of $2,304.50;
Taylor Consulting (Engineer), conference of experts [fees]' of $9,426.36;
Taylor trial attendance SAT trial [fee]' of
Total costs sought: $56,892.16
applicant's submissions in support of his costs application are as follows:
(the applicant) is the aggrieved party in this contract dispute.
respondent admitted they breached the Contract.
respondent 'breached the building permit' by not constructing to the National
Construction Code (
) and to the specification of the approved
constructed patio is not fit for purpose.
the engineers agreed the constructed patio is structurally sound, that does not
mean it complies with the NCC and it does
not, which was agreed to by them.
constructed patio is not in accordance with the approved drawings.
a builder wish to change the manner of construction they are required to lodge a
new building permit application prior to the
commencement of the works.
the constructed patio is not in accordance with the approved drawings the same
approved drawings cannot be submitted as part of
an application for a building
approval certificate (BA18) [sic
BA18 was filled out 6 years after the construction of the patio, costs had
already been incurred by him (the applicant) before
then, and no offer to submit
a BA18 was made while the HBWC Complaint was with the Building Commissioner or
during the final hearing
in the original proceeding.
because the BA18 was filled out does not mean it is compliant.
Retrospective
BA18 is not part of any provision in the Contract and when it is falsely filled
out, he (the applicant) does not have
to agree to it.
engineer's attempt to justify the non-compliant construction of the patio is not
a provision in the Contract.
(the applicant) does not agree with deviation from the minimum standard in the
'second planning application'.
Contract states that the patio was to be built to engineering drawings and to
council approval.
respondent should have stated in the Contract that they had no intention of
complying with the building permit and not constructing
to engineering drawings
or complying with council approval and then he (the applicant) would never have
signed the Contract and given
the job to the
respondent.
The respondent's costs application
respondent filed its costs application on 17 July 2025, in which it is
seeking the following costs:
(a) $429.00 for the preparation of an offer of
settlement to the applicant on 20 May 2024 (1 hour);
(b) $484.00 for the review of an expert report from the applicant on 8 August
2024 (1 hour);
(c) $7,260.00 for preparation for the final hearing between 11 and 25 March
2025 (15 hours);
(d) $2,574.00 for attendance as counsel on the first day of hearing on 26
March 2025 (6 hours); and
(e) $2,145.00 for attendance as counsel on the first day of hearing on 26
March 2025 (5 hours).
Total legal costs sought: $12,892.00
witness costs by Scott & Associates of:
(a) $9,900.00 for
reviewing and responding to the applicant's expert report prepared by Airey
Taylor Consulting;
(b) $4,537.50 for attending the expert witness conferral, liaising with the
applicant's expert witness, and preparing the joint expert
report; and
(c) $1,375.00 for attending the final hearing.
Total expert witness costs sought: $15,812.50
Total costs sought: $28,704.50
respondent's submissions in support of its costs application are as follows:
respondent submits that the applicant's claim and actions in prosecuting his
claim have been inappropriate, or in the alternative
unmeritorious, vexatious or
grossly exaggerated for the following reasons:
quote provided by the applicant in support of his claim for the reconstruction
cost of the patio is:
(i) based on a 'sketch provided by [the applicant]', but no details of the
sketch are provided;
(ii) for a free-standing patio as opposed to the supported patio that the
applicant contracted the respondent to build; and
(iii) details 'upgraded Columns of 100 x 1000 SHS and upgraded beams as
detailed on the sketch provided'.
(b) The applicant sought and failed to obtain punitive damages in the amount
of $10,000.00, but the applicant provided no evidence
regarding this element of
(c) The applicant has claimed legal costs of $28,877.83 despite not being
represented at any stage in the proceeding.
(d) The amount awarded to the applicant was only $233.00 which was less than
1% of the claim advanced by the applicant.
(e) The applicant installed electrical conduit through his hose gutters
(thereby decreasing their capacity) and then sought to blame
the inability of
those gutters to handle rainfall on the respondent's construction of the
(f) The applicant unreasonably refused to accept both a without
prejudice offer of settlement and an open offer of settlement.
(g) The video evidence of the applicant shows an outdoor rug and outdoor
chair under the patio, with the implication that despite
the applicant's
insistence that the patio was not fit for purpose, he has in fact used the patio
in the 7 years from when it was
constructed.
respondent refers to a without prejudice, save as to costs, offer of settlement
made by it to the applicant on 30 November 2023
respondent's November 2023
settlement offer
), a copy of which is included in the respondent's costs
application, which proposed:
(a) that the applicant consent to the
respondent applying to the City of Cockburn for a building approval certificate
with the respondent
paying for all costs associated with the application;
(b) if a building approval certificate was granted then the matter would be
settled and the applicant would withdraw the complaint;
(c) if a building approval certificate was not granted the respondent would
rectify any issues raised by the City or, if the City
required the patio to be
removed completely then the respondent would do that and refund to the applicant
the amount he had paid
for the patio;
(d) that the applicant allow access to his property for the patio to be
inspected by a 'building certifier' and for any alterations
required to be
undertaken by the respondent;
(e) drew the attention of the applicant to the obligation for him to mitigate
his loss; and
(f) was stated to be made on the Calderbank principles and was open for
acceptance by the applicant for a period of 21 days.
respondent submits that the applicant's rejection of that offer of settlement
was unreasonable because there was no cost to the
applicant in making an
application for a building approval certificate and the respondent would
undertake any work at its cost which
might be required prior to a building
approval certificate being issued or remove the patio at its cost and refund all
the applicant had paid for the patio if the City of Cockburn required
the patio to be removed.
respondent also refers to a letter sent to the applicant by the respondent's
legal representative dated 22 May 2024 (
respondent's May 2024 settlement
), which was put into evidence during the final hearing on 26 and 27
March 2025 and dealt with in Review Decision. However, the respondent
made any submission regarding the terms of that offer, other than to submit that
in light of the applicant's rejection of
both the respondent's November 2023
settlement offer and the respondent's May 2024 settlement offer, the Tribunal
should exercise
its discretion to award costs to the
respondent.
Applicable principles in respect of costs
principles applicable in respect of an application for costs in a proceeding
under the BSCRA Act have recently been well summarised
by Member Benter and
Sessional Member Woodforde in
Petsos and Judd
[2025] WASAT 26 (S)
- [29] as follows:
SAT Act provides that the general starting position in Tribunal proceedings is
that each party bears their own
, but that the
Tribunal has discretion to make an order for the payment of costs where it
appropriate.
builder's costs submissions seek to address the engagement between the relevant
provisions of the SAT Act and
Building Services (Complaint
Resolution and Administration) Act 2011
(1) Subject to this section, the Building
Commissioner or the State Administrative Tribunal may make such orders for costs
think fit in relation to proceedings arising from a building service
complaint or a HBWC complaint.
engagement between the relevant provisions in relation to the costs of building
disputes, and the principles applicable to determining
costs, have been
considered previously by the
well summarised by Senior Member Aitken of the Tribunal in
Deshmukh and Distinctive Building Services Pty
[2024] WASAT 62
) as follows:
Thus, in considering a claim for costs made pursuant to s 49(1) of the BSCRA
Act, the Tribunal is not required to start from the
position that each party is
to bear its own costs. However, as is well understood, costs do not 'follow the
event' in Tribunal proceedings
and the broad discretion conferred on the
Tribunal is to be properly exercised by taking into account relevant
considerations.
at [11] the Tribunal referred to the guidance given to the
Tribunal in relation to the exercise of its discretion to award costs
Court of Appeal in
Western Australian Planning Commission v Questdale
Holdings Pty Ltd
[2016] WASCA 32
which the following principles were found to
(1) The discretionary power is to be exercised
judicially; that is not arbitrarily, capriciously, or so as to frustrate the
legislative
(2) The power to award costs is to be exercised if it is fair
and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case to do so;
(3) The onus is on the party seeking an order in its favour to establish that
a favourable order ought to be made;
(4) Every party to proceedings before the Tribunal is taken to be cognisant
of the objectives of the Tribunal as expressly provided
for in s 9 of the
SAT Act. It is therefore necessary for the applicant to establish
that the respondent's conduct has impaired the
attainment of the Tribunal's
objectives to have the proceedings determined fairly and in accordance with
the substantial merits,
with as little formality and technicality as possible
and in a way which minimises the costs to the parties; and
(5) The mere fact that a party ultimately fails on a contention advanced
during the course of the hearing does not, in itself, signify
that the party has
acted inconsistently with the objectives set out in s 9 of the SAT Act.
[12] the Tribunal noted that if it exercises its discretion to award costs, it
is to approach the task of fixing costs in a broad
and relatively robust
fashion, referring to the decisions of the Tribunal
Perth Central Holdings Pty Ltd
and Doric Constructions Pty Ltd
[2008] WASAT 302
Marvelle Investments Pty Ltd and Argyle Holdings
[2010] WASAT 125 (S)
although fixing costs involves a relatively broad-brush approach, the
Tribunal must nevertheless be satisfied that the
costs claimed are reasonable
and not excessive in nature.
agree with the view of the Tribunal expressed in
in considering a claim for costs made pursuant to s 49(1) of the BSCRA Act,
the Tribunal is not required to start from the position
that each party is to
bear its own costs, although that does not mean that costs 'follow the
broad discretion conferred on the Tribunal under s 49(1) of the BSCRA Act
is to be properly exercised by taking into account relevant
considerations.
The power to award costs is to be exercised if it is fair and
reasonable in all the circumstances of the case to
do so and the onus is on the
party seeking an order for costs in its favour to establish that a favourable
order ought to be made.
the principles above in respect of the related proceedings, being building
dispute proceedings pursuant to the BSCRA Act,
the Tribunal is not required to
start from the position that each party is to bear its own costs and is to
exercise its discretion
as to costs taking into account all relevant
considerations.
noted above, the home owners' costs application is founded upon both the 25 June
Offer and the builder's conduct in the proceedings.
relation to the impact of a settlement offer on the costs of a proceeding in the
Tribunal, s 87(5) of the SAT Act states:
(5) The rules may deal with
the effect of certain offers to settle, and responses, if any, to the offer, on
the making of an order
for the payment by a party of the costs of another
State Administrative Tribunal Rules 2004
turn set out the process by which a party in Tribunal proceedings may make a
settlement offer to another party and, where such
an offer has been made,
r 42 provides as follows:
for costs if settlement offer is rejected
rule applies if -
(a) a party to a proceeding (other than a proceeding in the Tribunal's review
an offer in writing to
settle the proceeding; and
(b) the other party does not accept the offer within the time the offer is
(c) the offer complies with rules 40 and 41; and
(d) in the opinion of the Tribunal, the orders made by the Tribunal in the
proceeding are not more favourable to the other party than
(2) If this rule applies, the Tribunal is to, in determining the costs that
may be awarded, take into account that the party did not
accept an offer more
favourable than the Tribunal's order.
(3) In determining whether its orders are or are not more favourable to a
party than an offer, the Tribunal -
(a) must take into account any costs it would have ordered on the date the
offer was made; and
(b) must disregard any costs it ordered in respect of any period after the
date the offer was received.
reasoning behind the SAT Rules in respect of settlement offers, and the manner
in which they are applied, was addressed by the
Tribunal in
Giabeni Pty
Limited and the Owners of 30 Coode Street Mount Lawley Strata Plan 11321
[2024] WASAT 105 (S)
to [27] as follows:
SAT Rules encourage parties to settle their differences without the need for a
final hearing before the Tribunal. The is reflected
Clifford and Shire
of Busselton
[2007] WASAT 89 (S)
SAT Act, therefore, through s 87(5) and the rules referred to, reveals
parliamentary support for the idea that, where possible,
parties to proceedings
should endeavour to consider settlement. This intent is evident elsewhere in
the SAT Act. For example, s
9(b) makes it one of the main objectives of
the Tribunal to act as speedily and with as little formality and technicality as
is practicable,
and minimise the cost to parties. Section 52 encourages the
use of compulsory conference as an alternative to a final adversarial
Section 54 encourages mediation as an alternative to a final adversarial
hearing. Importantly, s 56 expressly deals with
settlement and enables the
Tribunal to make an order giving effect to a written settlement of the parties.
In this statutory context
then, the rules providing for the making and
acceptance of the settlement offers and for the making of an order for costs in
event that a settlement offer is rejected, or at least settling out factors
to be considered in relation to an application for an
order for costs in some
circumstances, are important.
there is no particular format that an offer to settle must be put. This is
reflected in
Gill & Ors and Wildnight Pty Ltd
[2008] WASAT 135
where the Tribunal noted at [40]:
is no format in the SAT Act with which the settlement offer must comply. There
is also no need for the settlement offer to refer
to the SAT Rules. The offer
must, however, be drafted in a way that, if accepted, an agreement
comes into being. It must therefore
be specific enough to settle issues in
dispute if it is accepted.
its original jurisdiction, which is the case here, the Tribunal is required to
take into account if a party did not accept an offer
of settlement made in
compliance with r 40 and r 41 of the SAT Rules which is more favourable
than the Tribunal's orders: s 87(5)
of the SAT Act. However, it does not
follow that a costs order will be made. This is because the SAT Rules do not
provide that a
party who makes an offer more favourable to a party than the
result achieved in the Tribunal, is by reason of that, entitled to an
costs. Rather, as stated by Martin CJ in
r 42 of the SAT Rules merely provides, perhaps superfluously, that the Tribunal
must take such matters into account. This
is the same as stated by the Tribunal
in the earlier decision of
considering whether a party's refusal to accept an offer made in accordance with
the Calderbank
unreasonable, the Victorian Court of Appeal in
Hazeldene's Chicken Farm
Pty Ltd v Victorian WorkCover Authority [No 2]
[2005] VSCA 298
Hazeldene's Chicken Farm
) stated at [25] that regard should
ordinarily be had to at least the following matters:
(a) the stage of the proceeding at which the offer was received;
(b) the time allowed to the offeree to consider the offer;
(c) the extent of the compromise offered;
(d) the offeree's prospects of success, assessed as at the date of the
(e) the clarity with which the terms of the offer were expressed;
(f) whether the offer foreshadowed an application for an indemnity costs in
the event of the offeree's rejecting it.
offer made in accordance with the SAT Rules may or may not, depending upon the
circumstances, also constitute an offer made in
accordance with the Calderbank
principles. However, whether a settlement offer is made pursuant to the SAT
Rules, the Calderbank
principles or both, the Tribunal has regularly referred to
the factors outlined in
Hazeldene's Chicken
as being matters relevant to the Tribunal's consideration of an
application for costs based upon a settlement offer that was not
relation to the otherwise broad discretion in respect of costs, the Tribunal in
McLerie and Koleszko
[2014] WASAT 160 (S)
are a range of factors that might contribute to the Tribunal making a costs
order, including the following nonexhaustive list:
a party conducts itself unreasonably, particularly where the conduct leads to
unnecessary costs to the other party;
a party has conducted itself inappropriately, particularly where the conduct
leads to unnecessary costs to the other party;
credibility of evidence is at the heart of a matter;
the application undermines the integrity of proceedings under the relevant
the case is weak, being incredible or implausible or obviously
unmeritorious;
a party has to embark in proceedings to vindicate its clear contractual
entitlement;
circumstances of the case having regard to the above, or other factors, are such
that the justice of the case supports moving
away from the initial position that
each party should bear their own costs; and
the case of proceedings conducted under the
Building Services (Complaint
Resolution and Administration) Act 2011
(WA) (BSCRA Act), although
49] thereof broadens the Tribunal's discretion in relation to costs, the
provision should not be understood as providing that
costs will generally follow
the result, it is neutral in effect, and should be applied in the manner which
is consistent with and
reinforces the objectives and procedures of the Tribunal
and any factors will be relevant which point to the justice of the case
requiring an award of costs;
as discussed in

will apply those principles in my consideration of both the applicant's costs
application and the respondent's costs application.
Consideration
must take into account the respondent's settlement offers and consider whether
the applicant's refusal to accept those offers was
unreasonable, so I will
commence my consideration of the costs applications by doing this, having regard
to the factors outlined
Hazeldene's Chicken Farm
Was the applicant's refusal to accept the respondent's November 2023 settlement
offer unreasonable?
respondent's November 2023 settlement offer was made very early in the review
proceeding. Leave to review the Dismissal Decision
was granted on 11 October
applicant was given 21 days to consider the settlement offer and the terms of
the offer were quite clear. However, those terms
incorrectly stated that the
respondent would apply for a building approval certificate, because it is only
the applicant who can
make that application.
if the City of Cockburn were to require that the constructed patio be removed
the offer to refund to the applicant the amount
he had paid for the patio would
most likely not have put him in the position to pay someone else to construct
the patio he had contracted
with the respondent to construct, because it is very
likely that the cost of constructing the patio would have risen significantly
between the date of the Contract (November 2017) and the date of the settlement
offer (November 2023).
in my view, the applicant's prospects of success as at the date of the
settlement offer in his claim against the respondent
were not clear.
those circumstances I consider that the applicant's refusal to accept this
settlement offer was reasonable.
Was the applicant's refusal to accept the respondent's May 2024 settlement offer
unreasonable?
respondent's May 2024 settlement offer was made quite early in the review
proceeding.
was no time limit placed on the applicant to consider the offer and the terms of
the offer were clear. It proposed a means
whereby the applicant could obtain
retrospective approval (a building approval certificate) for the constructed
as at the date of the settlement offer and thereafter the applicant was of the
view that the constructed patio did not meet
the requirements of the NCC and
would not be approved by the City of Cockburn. He obtained a report from his
engineer expert witness
at the end of July 2024 which concluded that the
constructed patio did not comply with the NCC.
question of whether the constructed patio complies with the NCC and whether it
is possible for a building approval certificate
to be obtained was not resolved
until the Review Decision was delivered by the Tribunal.
those circumstances I consider that the applicant's refusal to accept this
settlement offer was reasonable.
Exercise of the broad discretion regarding costs
applicant's submissions are all focussed on the apparent non-acceptance by the
applicant of the Review Decision and do not address
the principles and factors
which are relevant to the determination of a costs application.
the documents referred to by the applicant in support of his costs application
do not provide details of the work done by the
law firm (which he appears to
have engaged to provide legal advice, but which did not represent him in
either the original proceeding
or the review proceeding) or by the applicant's
engineer expert witness to justify the significant amounts claimed.
that is of no consequence because I have decided not to award costs to the
applicant for the reasons which follow.
my view neither party's case was implausible nor obviously unmeritorious.
issue of what amount of compensation should be awarded to the applicant
consequent upon the respondent's breach of the Contract,
by not obtaining a
building permit for the constructed patio, was highly contested by the parties
and turned on the question of whether
it is possible for retrospective approval
(a building approval certificate) to be obtained for the constructed
party had an engineer expert witness, both of whom are highly experienced civil
and structural engineers. Each of those engineers
had prepared a report and
they attended a conferral conference, following which they prepared a joint
statement. In the joint statement
they agreed on several issues, but they also
disagreed on several issues which went to the question of whether the
constructed patio
complies with the requirements of the NCC.
expert witnesses gave concurrent oral evidence during the final hearing in the
review proceeding which the Tribunal needed
to carefully consider and assess
following the conclusion of the final hearing.
Tribunal concluded on the evidence presented during the final hearing that the
respondent's May 2024 settlement offer satisfies
the legislative requirements
for retrospective approval and, therefore it is possible for the applicant to
obtain retrospective approval
for the constructed patio.
Consequently,
the Tribunal decided that by not taking up that offer, the applicant had not
taken all reasonable steps to mitigate
his loss consequent upon the breach of
the Contract by the respondent and the Tribunal only awarded the respondent the
amount which
would be payable to lodge the application for a building approval
certificate.
it was not until the Tribunal considered the documentary evidence received
during the final hearing and the oral evidence
given by the engineer expert
witnesses during the final hearing that the Tribunal was able to make that
is very regrettable that the costs incurred by each party which they have sought
to recover from the other party ($56,892.16 by
the applicant and $28,704.50 by
the respondent) far exceed the price paid by the applicant to the respondent for
the patio ($11,850.00)
and that the parties were not able to resolve the dispute
through the mediation conferences conducted by a Tribunal member during
proceeding.
the Tribunal is not required in this proceeding to start from the position that
each party is to bear its own costs, taking
into account all relevant
circumstances, which I have referred to above, I have decided that it
is not fair and reasonable to award
costs to either party. Therefore, I will
dismiss each party's application for costs.

The Tribunal orders:
applicant's application for costs filed on 17 July 2025 is dismissed.
