Braslis Registrar M Finlay
19 March 2025, the Applicant applied for the consent of the Respondent,
Maroondah City Council (
the Council
) to a building permit application for
a proposed design in respect of a garage to be built at 23 Lois Street, Ringwood
the Subject Land
garage would have a front setback of 7.5m instead of the required 9m as required
under reg 74 of the
Building Regulations 2018
Regulations
reg 74(4) of the Regulations:
The report and consent of the
relevant council must be obtained to an application for a building permit in
relation to a design that
does not comply with this regulation.
30 May 2025 the Council refused consent, reasoning that:
is considered that the proposed setback will result in a disruption of the
streetscape; and
is considered that the proposed setback will not be more appropriate taking into
account the prevailing setback within the street;
is considered that the siting of the building is not constrained by either the
shape or dimensions of the allotment; and
is considered that the siting of the building is not constrained by the slope of
the allotment or other conditions on the allotment;
is considered that there is no need to decrease the setback to maximise solar
access to habitable room windows and or private open
is considered that the proposal is not consistent with
Agreement AU016832T as registered on title.
26 June 2025 the Applicant appealed the decision (

have considered the parties’ written submissions, and the material filed
with the BAB. I have also had regard to the applicable
Decision Guidelines set
out under the Minister’s Guideline MG-12, given it is a relevant
consideration for the BAB to consider.
Based on these considerations I make the
following findings.
the provisions currently applied under the Regulations a 9m setback is required,
however a number of circumstances have been
considered as part of the appeal:
a) The prevailing setbacks along the street vary from 6m through to 9m.
b) Had there been a multi-unit development under Clause 55 of the Planning
Scheme, a 6m front setback would be permissible.
c) The Victorian State Government has developed a new Code for Townhouse and
Low-Rise developments, effectively amending Clause 55
(ResCode) of the Planning
Scheme through
as well as a new clause 54 similarly effecting singe dwellings on a
lot and small second dwellings. B2-1 of the Code will change
setback, reducing the front setback from 9m to 6m, no longer taking the average
of the two adjoining properties. The
standard takes the lesser setback of a
dwelling on an abutting allotment where this setback is less than 6m.
d) Whilst I appreciate that the Council had recommended to the applicant that
they withdraw the appeal and wait for the new Code
to come into effect, the
applicant nevertheless proceeded to appeal the decision of the Council.
regard to the above, I find that the request to construct the garage at a front
yard setback of 7.5m is considered reasonable
as it will not impose upon the
existing streetscape character. I further find that many homes along the street
have setbacks less
than 7.5m and that the single storey-built form has an
articulated façade. Finally, the new Statewide Code, were it a townhouse
or low-rise apartment building, enables the garage setback to be reduced even
further than the requested 7.5m.
