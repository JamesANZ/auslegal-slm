this decision, I determine to vary by consent the NSW Ambulance Control Centre
Officers (State) Award 2025 (Award).
Award is one of 30 awards which were remade by consent on 14 October
awards give effect to the offer from NSW Health on 5 August 2025 to increase
salaries and salary related allowances to staff covered
by Health Service Union
(HSU) awards (other than paramedics) by 4.0% from 1 July 2025 and 4.0% from 1
July 2026, on top of a statutory
0.5% increase in superannuation. The creation
of these awards ensures that employees covered by those awards will receive pay
over the next two years while the Health Secretary and HSU engage in
an ongoing process to modernise and consolidate those awards,
which is currently
before me as an industrial dispute (Awards Dispute).
no extra claims clause in each award refers to the Memorandum of Understanding
entered into by the parties on 18 September 2025:
“The parties have agreed to a Memorandum of Understanding on 18 September
2025 in relation to claims impacting this Award.
Consequently, this clause does
not preclude the parties from pursuing arbitrated outcomes in the Industrial
Relations Commission,
consistent with the terms of the MOU, which can take
effect as determined by the Industrial Relations Commission.
The Industrial Relations Commission recognises that other than the matters dealt
with in, or contemplated by the agreed MOU, or as
otherwise provided for in the
Industrial Relations Act 1996
, parties have given an undertaking not to pursue
further claims/demands or proceedings instituted before the NSW Industrial
Commission for extra or reduced wages, salaries, rates of pay,
allowances or conditions of employment with respect to the Employees
the Award that take effect prior to the nominal expiry of the Award unilaterally
made by a party to the Award unless otherwise
agreed by the parties.
This clause does not prevent the Parties from continuing collaborative
discussions during the life of the Award to deliver additional
enhancements to
remuneration and/or conditions of employment, and to achieve additional industry
wide and systemic efficiencies and
productivity improvements to the delivery of
Government services to the public. Changes to conditions or salaries may be
progressed and, if agreed, an application to vary the Award may be made
by consent prior to the nominal expiry of the Award.”
summary, the clause expresses that the parties have agreed on how certain claims
are to be dealt with if they cannot be resolved
by conciliation – namely
that they will be brought before the Commission to be arbitrated during the life
of the awards notwithstanding
the agreed pay increases. Matters that are agreed
can result in consent variations to the awards during their life.
a result of an agreement being reached as to one aspect of the HSU’s
claims the Health Secretary filed an application to
vary the Award by consent on
20 October, accompanied by an affidavit from Ms Alice Murphy, Director of
Industrial Relations and Change
at NSW Health. Following correspondence from my
chambers clarifying the wording of the variation, the Health Secretary filed an
application and amended affidavit from Ms Murphy on 21
Nature of variation
parties seek by consent to insert into clause 5 an entitlement to paid crib
breaks, in the following terms:
5. Roster of Hours
(i) The ordinary hours of duty prescribed by clause 23, Hours of Duty of the NSW
Ambulance Paramedics (State) Award, shall be worked
according to rosters which
shall be exhibited at least four weeks before the commencement date of the
roster and shall show the hours
of duty for the agreed roster period or 28 days
whichever is the greater. Casual employees are not subject to this clause.
(ii) Officers working a modified roster of shifts 12 hours or more will be
entitled to two paid 30 minutes crib breaks unless otherwise
agreed between the
(iii) Officers working shifts of less than 12 hours duration shall have one
paid 30 minute crib break unless otherwise agreed between
the parties.
(iv) Where practicable, employees shall not be required to work more than
five (5) hours without a crib break when working a shift
of 12 hours or
” (Emphasis added to indicate the variation.)
note that on 17 October 2025, Brent Armitage, Assistant Commissioner, Director
Control Centres, Clinical Operations emailed Mr Stuart
Hatter of the Health
Services Union expressing his understanding of the interpretation of the words
“Where practicable”
at the start of subclause (iv):
“Dear Stuart
NSW Ambulance notes your concerns regarding the term ‘Where
practicable..’ at the beginning of the proposed clause 5(iv).
I can confirm that this will not be used by NSW Ambulance to remove the rights
of employees to their crib break under this provision.
Clause 5(iv) only deals with the timing of when a crib break must be taken, not
the entitlement to a crib itself.
The ‘where practicable’ would only be exercised in cases where due
to circumstances outside of our control, the timing
of the crib break may fall
out of the award requirement for a crib to occur within the first five hours of
I trust this clarifies NSW Ambulance’s position on this matter.
Kind regards
Brent Armitage”
Consideration
determine that it is appropriate to approve the consent application and to vary
the Award pursuant to
Industrial Relations Act 1996
(NSW) (Act).
rely on my considerations at [13]–[18] in
Re Health Employees’
Administrative Staff (State) Award 2024 and other Health Awards
October when I remade this Award.
The proposed variation does not affect the Award’s provision for equal
remuneration and other conditions of employment for
male and female employees
doing work of equal and comparable value, pursuant to
of the Act, nor
does it derogate from the reasons as to why it is in the public interest to vary
the Awards having regard to the
objects of the Act.
also accept Ms Murphy’s evidence that the variation will not detrimentally
affect NSW’s economy or the NSW Government’s
fiscal position and
outlook. That is because the varied Award reflects an agreement that has been
reached between the parties after
an extensive period of negotiation facilitated
by the Commission, in respect of a workforce of approximately 197 full time
variation to the Award will take effect from 1 July 2025, as it is made by
consent and is sought in the context of an industrial
dispute notified to the
Commission prior to that date.
consent application does not resolve the negotiations over the HSU’s log
of claims. Both parties need to make genuine attempts
to efficiently progress
those aspects of the log of claims upon which they can agree and otherwise
progress to arbitrate the balance
of the claims, as contemplated by the MOU
referred to in the Award’s no extra claims clause.
a conciliation involving the parties on 16 October I took the opportunity to
voice my concern that industrial action might
threaten the MOU and the good work
that has been done to date to modernise health awards. That arose in
circumstances where, on 9
October, employees covered by the Award notified NSW
Health that they would take industrial action due to concerns about the progress
of negotiations. That in turn led to NSW Health seeking urgent conciliation and,
if necessary, the making of dispute orders. Following
conciliation, the parties
reached an interim agreement which included the HSU withdrawing the industrial
action. The parties have
in the MOU agreed on a process to resolve the
outstanding aspects of the HSU’s log of claims and I expect them to abide
that agreement. That means bringing any claims that cannot be agreed to the
Commission for determination rather than seeking to advance
them by means of
industrial action. The Commission stands ready to assist the parties to reach
agreement where agreement can be reached
and otherwise to help them determine
the most efficient way the outstanding issues can be
arbitrated.

Industrial Relations Act 1996
NSW Ambulance Control Centre Officers (State) Award 2025 is varied in the terms
set out in Schedule 1 of the application
filed by the Health Secretary on 21
October 2025.
