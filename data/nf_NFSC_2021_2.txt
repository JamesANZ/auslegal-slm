REASONS FOR
31 May 2021, the offender, Adrian Kenton
, entered pleas of guilty
to all counts in the indictment, including counts 1 and 2 (the
), that were:
(1) On or about 19 July 2018 at Norfolk
he possessed a controlled drug, cannabis, contrary to s 308.1(1) of the
in the Schedule to the
Criminal Code Act 1995
federal possession count
(2) Between 9 April 2019 and 11 April 2019 at the Island, he trafficked in a
controlled drug, methamphetamine, contrary to s 302.4(1)
trafficking count
federal possession count carries a maximum penalty of two years’
imprisonment or 400 penalty units ($84,000) or both and
the trafficking count
carries a maximum penalty of ten years’ imprisonment or 2,000 penalty
units ($420,000) or both. At the
times of the offending, a penalty unit under
Crimes Act 1914
(Cth) was $210.
Can a recognisance release order impose conditions for home
detention on the federal counts?
the course of argument on sentence, the Crown argued that there was no power
(1)(b) of the
for a court to
include one or more conditions in a recognisance release order imposed after a
sentence of imprisonment that have
the effect of a home detention order under
s 43 of the
Sentencing Act 2007
The statutory scheme
provisions of Pt IB of the
apply to the sentencing of the
offender on each of the federal counts. Under
, where, as I will do here, on conviction of an offender, a court imposes
one or more federal sentences of imprisonment not exceeding
three years in
total, it must make a single recognisance release order in respect of all such
sentences, except in certain limited
circumstances that do not apply in the
present case.
power to impose conditions in a recognisance release order is found in
that relevantly provides:
20 Conditional release of offenders after
(1) Where a person is convicted of a federal
offence or federal offences, the court before which he or she is convicted may,
thinks fit:
by order, release the
person, without passing sentence on him or her, upon his or her giving security,
with or without sureties, by
recognizance or otherwise, to the satisfaction of
the court, that he or she will comply with the following conditions
(i) that he or she will be of good behaviour for such period, not exceeding 5
years, as the court specifies in the order;
(ii) that he or she will make such reparation or restitution, or pay such
compensation, in respect of the offence or offences (if
any), or pay such costs
in respect of his or her prosecution for the offence or offences (if any), as
the court specifies in the
order (being reparation, restitution, compensation or
costs that the court is empowered to require the person to make or pay):
(A) on or before a date specified in the order; or
(B) in the case of reparation or restitution by way of money payment or in the
case of the payment of compensation or an amount of
costs--by specified
instalments as provided in the order;
(iii) that he or she will pay to the Commonwealth such pecuniary penalty (if
any) as the court specifies in the order (being a penalty
not exceeding the
maximum amount of the penalty that, in accordance with subsection (5), the court
may specify in respect of the
offence or offences) on or before a date specified
in the order or by specified instalments as provided in the order;
that he or she will, during a period, not exceeding 2 years, that is
specified in the order, comply with such other conditions (if
any) as the court
thinks fit to specify in the order
Example: A condition under subparagraph (iv) could be that the person will
undertake a specified counselling, education or treatment
program during a
specified part of, or throughout, the specified period.
(b) sentence the person to imprisonment in respect of the offence or each
offence but direct, by order, that the person be released,
upon giving security
of the kind referred to in paragraph
(emphasis added)
Relevantly,
, (1AA), (1A), (3) and (4) provide:
20AB Additional sentencing
alternatives
(1) A court may pass a sentence, or make an
order, in respect of a person convicted before the court in a participating
State or participating
Territory of a federal offence,
(a) subsection (1AA) applies to
the sentence or order; and
(b) under the law of the State or Territory, a court is empowered to pass such a
sentence, or make such an order, in respect of a
State or Territory offender in
corresponding cases; and
(c) the first‑mentioned court is:
(i) empowered as mentioned in paragraph (b); or
(ii) a federal court.
(1AA) This subsection applies to a sentence
or order that is:
(a) known as any of the
(i) an attendance centre order or attendance order;
(ii) a community based order;
(iii) a community correction order;
(iv) a community custody order;
(v) a community service order;
(vi) a community work order;
(vii) a drug or alcohol treatment order or rehabilitation order;
(viia) a residential treatment order;
(viii) a good behaviour order;
(ix) an intensive correction order;
(x) an intensive supervision order;
(xi) a sentence of periodic detention or a periodic detention order;
(xii) a sentence of weekend detention or a weekend detention order;
(xiii) a work order; or
(b) similar to a sentence or order to which paragraph (a) applies; or
(c) prescribed for the purposes of this
subsection.
(1A) Where the law of a participating State
or a participating Territory requires that before passing a sentence, or making
of the kind referred to in paragraph (1)(b) a court must first pass
another sentence or make another order (whether or not that other
sentence or
other order is suspended upon the making of the first‑mentioned sentence
or order), then, a court is not required,
before passing or making that
first‑mentioned sentence or order in respect of a person convicted by that
court for a federal
offence, to pass that other sentence or make that other
(3) Where a sentence or order referred to in subsection (1) is passed or made
under that subsection in respect of a person convicted
in a State or Territory
of a federal offence, the provisions of the laws of the State or Territory with
respect to such a sentence
or order that is passed or made under those laws
shall, so far as those provisions are capable of application and are not
inconsistent
with the laws of the Commonwealth, apply, by virtue of this
subsection, to and in relation to the sentence or order passed or made
subsection (1).
(4) Where a court passes a sentence, or makes an order, under subsection (1) in
respect of a person convicted of an offence against
the law of the Commonwealth,
the court may also do all or any of the
(a) impose any fine or other
pecuniary penalty that the court is empowered to impose on the person for the
(b) make any order requiring the person to make reparation or restitution, or
pay compensation, in respect of the offence that the
court is empowered to
(c) make any other order that the court is empowered to
definition of “participating Territory” in
s 3B(2)(b)(i)
includes the Island. Regulation 15 of the
Regulation 2019
(Cth) prescribes, for the purposes of s 20AB(1AA), a
and the Northern Territory. However, reg 15 does not prescribe as an alternate
sentencing option, under s 20AB(1)(b) or (c), a home
detention order of the
kind that this Court can make under s 43 of the
Sentencing Act
(NI) in respect of offences against the laws of the Island
The Crown’s submissions
Crown relied, for its stance, on
R v Shambayati
[1999] QCA 12
105 A Crim R 373
. There, Pincus, Davies and Thomas
JJA held that the power in s 20(1)(a)(iv) did not allow a condition to be
imposed in a recognisance
release order which had the effect of the additional
orders that s 20AB(1) expressly contemplated could be imposed under it,
as home detention or community service. The Crown contended that it would
be inconsistent with s 20AB to use s 20(1)(a)(iv) to impose
condition in a recognisance release order. It submitted that the only form of
conditional release from imprisonment for a
period of three years or less
available under federal law was a recognisance release order. It argued that
s 20(1)(a)(iv) did not
permit a court, when sentencing for a federal
offence, to seek to mimic the effect of a State or Territory law that allowed a
to order a sentence of imprisonment to be served by way of home detention
or community service, relying on

Consideration
reject the Crown’s submission.
purpose of a recognisance release order evinced in
is that it operates as part of an overall sentence of imprisonment, in
lieu of a period of parole, at the conclusion of the time
of no more than three
years that an offender must spend in a prison. The power to make such an order,
necessarily, contemplates
that it may operate as a restriction on the liberty of
the individual to whom it applies. That power is contained in
which is headed “Conditional release of offenders after conviction”.
The power is intended to be used to regulate the
behaviour of the offender while
he or she is released from serving the balance of a sentence of imprisonment and
up to five years
after his or her release
(s 20(1)(a)(i))
by requiring him
or her to comply with “such other conditions (if any) as the court thinks
fit to specify in the order”
(s 20(1)(a)(iv)).
It is a power that
must be exercised as part of the Court’s duty under
“impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in
all the circumstances of the offence”. It
follows that it is inherent in
the statutory scheme that the conditions that a court has power to include in a
recognisance release
order must have regard to punishment of the severity
appropriate to the crime of which the offender stands convicted.
Isaacs v McKinnon
[1949] HCA 64
(1949) 80 CLR 502
, Latham CJ, Rich,
McTiernan and Webb JJ held that a condition could be imposed under
s 20(1)(a)(iv)
that required a bankrupt, who had been convicted of
disposing of his property other than in the ordinary way of his trade, to pay
the Official Receiver £160 a year, by quarterly instalments, for five
years. The Court held that the conditions of the recognisance
relevant to the behaviour of the person sentenced in matters affecting the Act
under which the conviction occurred. McTiernan
J, with whom Rich J agreed
on this issue, said (80 CLR at 520, and see too per Latham CJ at
510–511, Webb J at 531–532):
... The Court of Bankruptcy is a court to which
gives the powers contained in that provision. It
adds those powers to the powers conferred by the
Bankruptcy Act
court. Section 20 (1) gives to the Court of Bankruptcy the same general
discretion in respect of the conditional release
of offenders as the provision
gives to any other court.
The question whether any condition upon which a
court orders the release of an offender is within the general discretion given
s. 20 (1) would depend upon its connection with some relevant principle such
as retribution, correction or punishment and perhaps
various moral and social
considerations
. From this point of view the discretion which the Court of
Bankruptcy has under s. 20 (1) is not more limited than that of any other
to which it applies. But the discretion is one which every court is bound to
exercise subject to law. Neither the Court of
Bankruptcy nor any other court may
impose a condition which contravenes the
Bankruptcy Act
or any other
statute or is contrary to public policy.
(emphasis added)
J, who dissented on the issue of whether the condition was contrary to the
policy of bankruptcy law, said (80 CLR at 523):
The words “such conditions as the court thinks
fit to impose” are very wide
but they do not authorize the imposition
of conditions which are repugnant to the principles or policy of the law or are
to the purpose of the power.
The provision is concerned with the
consequences of crimes against Federal law
. Federal laws against which
offences may be committed deal with a variety of subjects and the specific
applications of the power
to impose conditions must vary
accordingly.
The Owners of the Ship “Shin Kobe Maru” v Empire Shipping Co Inc
(1994) 181 CLR 404 at 421, Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson,
Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said (applied in
PM v The Queen
[2007] HCA 49
(2007) 232 CLR 370
per Gleeson CJ, Hayne, Heydon and
Crennan JJ):
It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring
limitations which are not found in the express words.
(citation omitted)
the text of s 20(1)(a)(iv), as taken up when s 20(1)(b) applies by
force of s 19AC(1), lends no support to acting on an
unexpressed limitation
on the power it confers on the Court to impose conditions in a recognisance
release order that apply to regulate
the behaviour of the convicted person when
the Court has ordered him or her to be released from serving a sentence of
imprisonment
subject to conditions:
Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commission
of Territory Revenue
[2009] HCA 41

per Hayne, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.
width of the power appearing in the ordinary and natural meaning of s
20(1)(a)(iv) is reinforced by the note underneath it that
gives examples of
conditions that may be ordered that require the person to undertake specific
activities during a particular period.
Compliance with such an order
necessarily involves a restriction on the freedom that the convicted person
would otherwise have had.
Adams v Carr
(1987) 47 SASR 205
at 214–216, von Doussa J, with whom King CJ and Bollen J agreed, held that
a condition could be imposed under s 20(1)(a)(iv)
that the person undertake
a specified number of hours of community service and obey the lawful directions
of a community service
officer to whom the person is assigned, even though a
court sentencing for a federal offence could not make the order directly under
State or Territory law referred to in
That was because the non-federal law did not authorise, for example, a community
service order, to be made as part of an order
imposing a good behaviour bond.
requires a court imposing a sentence of
three years or less for a federal offence to make a recognisance release order
as the gateway
to regulate the convicted person’s conduct during the
non-custodial phase of his or her sentence, courts have held that for
to be validly made under a State or Territory law picked up in
it must be able to be made in the same circumstances as an order under
. However, as von Doussa J explained in
47 SASR at 214–216, a condition imposed under
s 20(1)(a)(iv)
can achieve a similar outcome as an order that cannot be
made directly by picking up a non-federal law as
my opinion, the reasoning in
105 A Crim R at
376 [17] is plainly wrong so far as it may apply to the current form of the
s 20AB(1AA)(a)(vii)
, (viia) and (viii)
specifically apply to drug or alcohol treatment, rehabilitation, residential
treatment and good behaviour orders.
Such orders are consistent with both
s 20(1)(a)(i)
, that enables the Court to require the person to be of good
behaviour for such period not exceeding five years as specified in the
recognisance release order, and with the examples given in the note to
s 20(1)(a)(iv).
, the reasoning is in the teeth of the
express words of
s 20(1)(a)(iv)
, was contrary to the construction of the
provision in
80 CLR at 510–511, 523–524 and ignored
the principles of statutory construction in
Shin Kobe Maru
at 421, 520, 531–532;
239 CLR at 46–47 [47].
, the reasoning failed to recognise that
source of power for a court to impose a sentencing order under
that should be construed in accordance with the
principles of statutory construction to which I have referred. Their
use of the existence of the power to make additional orders
conferred in
as a limitation on the wide power in
s 20(1)(a)(iv)
inverted the need to have regard to each section as a source
of power, reading its text in its ordinary and natural meaning.
[1949] HCA 64
recognised, the discretion in
s 20(1)(a)(iv)
could not be exercised to impose a condition that was
contrary to public policy or the Act creating the offence. Indeed, a discretion
of that kind is, ordinarily, construed as “unconfined except in so far as
the subject matter and the scope and purpose of the
statutory enactments may
enable the Court to pronounce given reasons to be definitely extraneous to any
objects the legislature could
have had in view”:

Irrigation Commission (NSW) v Browning

at 49; see too
R v Theodossio
(1998) 104 A Crim R 367
at 370 per de Jersey
CJ, McPherson JA and Chesterman J.
the Parliament evinced a policy that the sentencing provisions of the
could achieve sentencing outcomes consistent with, indeed (subject to
there being no conflict with the Act itself), in the exact
participating State and Territory laws referred to in s 20AB(1). It would
be an odd result that if such an outcome, like
a home detention order, was able
to be imposed in one participating State or Territory but not in another, the
law of which made
its imposition inconsistent with Pt IB of the
, a sentencing court in the latter jurisdiction could not seek to achieve
the same outcome by structuring appropriately adapted conditions
recognisance release order, as von Doussa J explained in
47 SASR at 214–216. The Parliament can be taken to have
intended that the exercise of sentencing powers conferred in the
on courts across the Commonwealth should provide, so far as possible,
consistent outcomes for similar offending. That principle
underlines all
federal sentencing:

addition, in
Atanackovic
45 VR at 206–207 [89]–[93],
Weinberg, Kyrou and Kaye JJA said, in
obiter dicta
, that it was arguable
that a federal sentence could be structured under
to combine more
than one sentencing disposition (see 207 [92]). In
[2019] SASCFC 5
, Kourakis CJ, Blue and Lovell JJ said:
... It can be accepted that it is only on a recognizance
release order pursuant to which a Commonwealth offender can be released from
prison before the expiration of a term of imprisonment of less than three years.
However, the imposition of further penalties or obligations on the
defendant’s release from prison, whether on a recognizance
release order
or on the expiry of the sentence, would not impinge on the conditions of
release. The penalty order operates in the
event of release but does not detract
from the legal operation of
Nor does it trespass
onto any field covered by
because the terms and conditions of the
recognizance are no more than that they determine what will breach the
recognizance and subject
the defendant to the sanctions provided for by
(emphasis added)
these reasons, I am of opinion that

authorise the inclusion in a recognisance release order of
conditions that have the same effect that could be achieved were there
to impose any of the alternate sentencing options,
including home detention available under the Island’s
47 SASR at 214–216.
Accordingly,
I will, when passing sentence, make a recognisance release order in the
