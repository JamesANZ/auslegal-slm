principles applicable to awards of costs in this Tribunal are well settled. This
Tribunal has the power to award costs pursuant
to Section 53(2) of the Consumer,
Trader Tenancy Tribunal Act 2001 (the Act) at its discretion and under clause
20(3)(a) of the CTTT
Regulation 2009. Such discretion is restricted where the
amount in dispute is less than $30,000.00 as is the case here to situations
“the Tribunal is satisfied that there are exceptional
circumstances that warrant the
awarding of costs...”.
not a matter where the Tribunal has an unfettered discretion by reason of the
latter provision.
BACKGROUND HISTORY
have reviewed the detailed submissions of the parties in relation to their
respective costs claims. In my Reasons for Decision dated
1 August 2013. I
indicated that I did not have jurisdiction nor did I propose to adjudicate on
the issue relating to the effect of
the Deed of Settlement between the parties
in relation to the earlier proceedings. For the same reason I do not propose to
upon that course in relation to the costs question. What occurred in the
earlier proceedings and the costs incurred in respect of
those proceedings are
not relevant to or recoverable in this proceeding. I propose to adjudicate the
costs question on the basis
of the following factual scenario:
was a deed of settlement resolving the earlier Tribunal proceedings between the
parties with respect to the subject premises.
That deed called for the builder
to carry out certain rectification work as set out in the terms of that deed.
to the issue of this application in matter no 12/14311; no work was performed by
the builder with respect to the rectification
in pursuance of his obligation
under the terms of the deed.
party lays blame on the other as to why the builder had not completed the work
required under the deed
this application was issued the builder, following an order of Member Meadows in
April 2012, returned to the site for two days
in May 2012 and carried out a
substantial proportion of the works required.
reason that the outstanding work was not completed was because the parties could
not agree on what was required to be done with
respect to the condition of the
external surface of the premises.
was that single issue, i.e the condition of the external surface, and what was
required to rectify it, that remained in dispute
and in respect of which the
Tribunal’s decision of 1 August 2013 related.
value of the claim the subject of this application as it came before me on 3
July 2013 I find at its highest was less than $30,000.00.
number of attempts were made to settle the matter all of which failed. The
series of settlement offers and counter offers and supporting
documentation is
set out in the parties’ submissions. For reasons that will be set out
later the only offer of significant
relevance to this determination is the final
one made by the builder on 31 July 2013 in the following terms:
“1 The respondent pay the applicants the sum of $11000 in full and
final settlement of this matter.
2 Each party to be at liberty to make an application for costs on the
THE HOMEOWNERS’ SUBMISSION
party that was ultimately successful in obtaining
a monetary order and also that
it had earlier been successful in defeating the builder’s earlier interim
application to have
this matter dismissed. It is further contended that pursuant
to Clause 20(3) of the Consumer, Trader Tenancy Tribunal Regulation
the Tribunal should be satisfied that the circumstances as presented are
exceptional within the meaning of this provision
and because of the
builder’s failure to comply with the obligation made under the earlier
deed of settlement as well as its
obligations under the Act, in failing to
complete the rectification work in a timely, proper and tradesman-like
THE BUILDER’S SUBMISSION
builder submits essentially that the homeowners were only successful in
obtaining a monetary order for less than what they were
offered on three
occasions. Further that it was unreasonable for the homeowners counter offers to
have included legal costs from
the 2009 proceeding and that the amount of such
costs had precluded a settlement being reached. The builder says that all of its
offers including the one dated 31 July 2013 set out above were made pursuant to
the principles in Calderbank.
is not a matter where the Tribunal has an unfettered discretion to award costs.
I find that the amount left in dispute at least
after January 2013, on the
discretion to award costs
can only be exercised if it considers that there are
exceptional circumstances to warrant same in accordance with clause 20(3)(a)
the Regulation outlined above.
am satisfied having regard to the evidence in the proceedings that the builder
had opportunity to carry out the work required of
it under the deed and
therefore that the homeowners were left with little alternative to commence this
further application. One also
has to be mindful of the fact that the builder did
not return to perform any rectification work until being ordered to do so in
2012 by Member Meadows.
having regard to the earlier history which led to the deed of settlement and the
circumstances following that agreement I
accept that there were complex legal
issues involved irrespective of whether that amount which remained in dispute
involved a sum
greater than $30,000.00.
have not and do not propose to outline any of the circumstances relating to the
various failed proposals made on behalf of either
of the parties relating to the
doing of the work pursuant to the deed, nor to make any determination as to the
reasonableness of
either parties stance. I simply observe and have been mindful
of the fact that it was the builder’s breach in relation to the
led to the issue of the initial proceedings that resulted in the agreement for
the further work to be undertaken. I am
also mindful of the Member’s
comments in this regard in dismissing the builder’s application on 11
September 2012 to
have this application dismissed on the basis that the Tribunal
had no further jurisdiction.
am satisfied that the circumstances that prevailed were somewhat exceptional and
on that basis find that an award in favour of the
respect to the costs of this application even though the eventual amount of the
award was less than
$10,000.00. However any determination of the costs should
have regard to the reduced extent to which the homeowners succeeded.
relation to the builder’s various offers of settlement except for the
final one, which commenced in November 2012; whilst
these may all have been
genuine attempts to bring about a conclusion to the litigation the form of those
offers on an inclusive of
costs basis rendered them ineffective in achieving the
purpose which they were seeking. The builder’s final offer 31 July 2013
outlined at paragraph 6 H above was unambiguous in its terms and left the costs
issue separate and was a real and genuine attempt
by the builder pursuant to the
Calderbank principle to avoid a further day of costs. The homeowners’
failure to accept that
offer in light of the resulting award amount being less
entitles the builder to an award of costs on an indemnity basis for that
day pursuant to Calderbank.
