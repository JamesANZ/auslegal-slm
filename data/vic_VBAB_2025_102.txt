INTRODUCTION
28 March 2025, the Building Appeals Board (
) determined the appeal
proceeding. The orders made by the BAB on that day gave the parties liberty to
apply for costs. The Applicant
now seeks an order that their costs of and
associated with this proceeding be paid by ‘the Respondent and Interested
jointly and/or
severally’.
Applicant owns the land at 75-79 Bay St, Brighton (
Adjoining Property
and until 23 January 2024 it was owned by the Second Interested Party. The
Applicant is also a director of the Second Interested
Party. The First
Interested Party (
First Interested Party
) is the owner of
the land at 71-73 Bay St, Brighton (
Building Site
), and the Respondent
) was appointed the private building surveyor in
respect of the building work that was to be carried out at the Building Site.
support of her application, the Applicant has filed and served a document titled
‘Applicant’s Cost Submissions’
dated 11 April 2025
Applicant’s Submissions
). Schedule A to the Applicant’s
Submissions comprises copies of the tax invoices of costs claimed. The
Respondent has filed
and served a document titled ‘Respondent’s
Submissions: Costs’ dated 9 May 2025 (
Respondent’s
Submissions
) opposing the Applicant’s application for costs. Neither
of the Interested Parties has filed submissions, although the Applicant
the Second Interested Party was the previous owner of the Adjoining Property,
and that the Applicant is a director of the Second
Interested Party.
Consequently, although the Applicant’s Submissions state that costs are
claimed ‘jointly and/or severally’
from the Respondent and
Interested Parties, I assume that the Applicant intends only to claim from the
Respondent and the First Interested
BAB has jurisdiction to order that one party pay another party’s costs of
a BAB proceeding. Clause 16(2) of sch 3 to the
Building Act 1993
The determination may include any order as
to costs that the Building Appeals Board, on the application of a party to the
proceeding,
considers is just.
17 of sch 3 to the Act provides:
Unless the Building
Appeals Board otherwise determines, a party to a proceeding before the Board
must bear his, her or its own costs.
v Building Practitioners Board &
Gillard J considered
the operation of cl 17 of sch 3 to the
His Honour stated:
...It is clear from clause 17 that the Board does
have power to make an order for costs. It establishes a general rule, namely,
there should be no order as to costs. But, it is clear that the Board may,
in appropriate circumstances, refuse to follow the general
rule and make an
order for costs. One looks in vain to find any criterion to guide the Board when
application is made to override
the general rule and order costs.
However, in my opinion, the presence of the general rule requires that
circumstances must be established to override the general rule,
and that means
something more than being a successful
there is no presumption that costs will be awarded to a successful party in a
proceeding before the Board.
Accordingly,
I approach the question of costs guided by the principle that there must be
circumstances which override the general
rule in proceedings before the BAB;
namely, that the parties must bear their own costs, before it will consider
making an order for
approach is consistent with the opinion of Bell J in
Martin v Fasham Johnson
, in discussing the
costs discretion of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (another
‘bear own costs’ jurisdiction).
In that case, his Honour stated
...The discretion must be exercised judicially, which means
that the Tribunal must act fairly, impartially and by reference to relevant
considerations and not arbitrarily, capriciously or by reference to irrelevant
considerations and not in a manner that frustrates
the legislative intent.
The Tribunal is a creature of statute and, on the question of costs, it
commences from a different starting point. Usually parties
must bear their own
costs, which no doubt reflects the general object of the Act. That object ....
is to promote access to justice
generally and to minimise the overall level of
costs in tribunal proceedings as far as
practicable.
16(2) of sch 3 to the Act does not give any guidance as to what circumstances an
order for costs is
considered just
. However, it is clear that there must
be circumstances that justify overriding the general rule that the parties bear
their own costs.
SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPLICANT
Applicant submits that orders for costs in her favour are justified in this
proceeding because of the ‘significant departures
from expected
professional standards encountered in this
The Applicant submits
further that ‘the involvement and approach adopted by the First Interested
Party has added significant
difficulty and expense to the
proceeding.’
Applicant also submits that the BAB’s determination and orders dated 28
March 2025 ‘have entirely vindicated the Applicant’s
Applicant submits that the order sought ‘is not ...to punish the
Respondent or the First Interested Party, but rather to
indemnify the Applicant

(b) the Respondent preparing an expert report dated 21 March 2024 on behalf of

Applicant submits that the BAB should ‘consider the commercial enterprise
and development gain (which variously the Interested
Parties and the Respondent
were engaged in) as against the Applicant’s status as simply the owner of
the [A]djoining [P]roperty,
with no interest as to the development
occurring’.
Applicant claims costs fixed in the sum of $23,154, which is the total sum of
the invoices set out in Schedule A to the Applicant’s
Submissions.
Alternatively, the Applicant submits that ‘if the Board is not minded to
fix the Applicant’s costs, ...the
Board should exercise its discretion to
award costs on a standard basis, to be taxed in default of
agreement’.
SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENT
Respondent opposes the Applicant’s application. The Respondent submits
that the Applicant’s grounds do not demonstrate
any basis for the BAB to
depart from the position that parties bear their own
support of his position, the Respondent submits that,
(a) there was no determination of the appeal on its merits. Rather, the
Determination was quashed because the subject matter of the
dispute had
‘fallen away’, because the building permit application had been
(b) when the protection work notice was issued, the Respondent was
‘justifiably...of the view that the Protection Works...
were appropriate
in all of the
circumstances’;
(c) the Respondent’s conduct does not give rise to any inference that he
acted in a manner ‘which could be construed
as being vexatious, obdurate
and/or unreasonable’;
(d) the Applicant has not provided any basis to suggest that the Respondent
acted inappropriately or that the report he prepared
is ‘tainted by
(e) disagreement with consent orders does not necessarily give rise to an
entitlement to costs, and the ‘debate between the
essentially centred around whether any further orders should be made and/or
whether the continued debate about academic
matters was necessary in the
circumstances’. The Respondent submits further that the Question that
came before the BAB was
‘academic’ as the subject matter of the
dispute had fallen away.
Claim against the Respondent
my view, the Applicant has not demonstrated that there are grounds to depart
from the general rule that the parties bear their
own costs in matters before
the BAB in respect of the claim made against the Respondent.
Applicant relies on alleged ‘departures from expected professional
standards’ on the part of the Respondent. Further,
the Applicant refers
, failings in the protection work notice, and the fact that
the Respondent prepared an expert report.
as a result of the application for the building permit being withdrawn, the BAB
made no findings about the above matters.
The only substantive issue that was
resolved by the BAB was the Question, and answering the Question did not require
any findings
to be made about the conduct of any party.
resolution of the Question was needed because the parties were unable to agree
on appropriate orders notwithstanding that
the building permit application had
been withdrawn. Of course, the Applicant was within her rights to continue with
her application
in these circumstances, but it does not follow that the
Respondent should be required to pay her costs. I do not consider that the
circumstances are such as to override the general rule that the parties bear
their own costs.
the Applicant’s application that the Respondent pay her costs is
Claim against the First Interested Party
First Interested Party did not file any submissions in respect of the
application for costs made by the Applicant.
of the issues set out above in respect of the Applicant’s claim against
the Respondent also apply to the claim against
the First Interested Party. In
particular, no findings about the substantive matters in dispute were made
because the building permit
application was withdrawn.
I do not accept that ‘the involvement and the approach adopted by the
First Interested Party has added significant
difficulty and expense to the
proceeding’.
Determination the subject of the substantive appeal was made on 19 January 2024.
The Applicant was notified that the application
for the building permit was
withdrawn on 11 June 2024. I do not consider that the conduct in this
approximately five-month period
was such as to add significant difficulty and
expense to the proceeding.
the building permit application had been withdrawn, the parties acknowledged
that the building work the subject of that application
would not be
proceeding.
Therefore, while the
Applicant was entitled to have the BAB consider and determine whether the
Determination should be quashed, and
indeed the Determination was subsequently
quashed, that decision was based on the fact that the Determination had been
rendered irrelevant.
incurred after it was clear that the building permit application had been
withdrawn could have been largely avoided had
the parties agreed appropriate
orders to bring the appeal to an end. I do not consider the fact that the
parties were unable to
agree such orders justifies a departure from the general
rule that the parties bear their own costs.
notwithstanding that the Adjoining Property was owned by the Applicant from 23
January 2024 (that is, four days after the
Determination was issued), the costs
incurred until 17 September 2024 (that is, until well after notification to the
Applicant that
the building permit application had been withdrawn) were incurred
by the Second Interested Party.
I have no evidence before me that the Applicant indemnified or otherwise repaid
the Second Interested Party those costs. While I
accept that the Applicant is a
director of the Second Interested Party, the shares in the Second Interested
Party are owned by Caligula
Nominees Pty Ltd, and the Second Interested Party is
a separate legal entity from the Applicant. In those circumstances, and
notwithstanding
that I am not satisfied that it is justified to depart from the
general rule that parties bear their own costs, I would have had
difficulty in
accepting that an order should be made requiring the First Interested party to
pay the Applicant costs not incurred
the Applicant’s application that the First Interested Party pay the
Applicant’s costs is refused.
