REASONS FOR RULING
Introduction
Executive Director of the South Australian Council of Social Service Inc.
(“SACOSS”) lodged correspondence with the
Board of Management of the
WorkCover Corporation of S.A. dated 14 December 2012, purporting to be an
application for review pursuant
to section 72M of the
Workers Rehabilitation
and Compensation Act 1986
(“the Act”), which was in the
following terms:
I am acting on behalf of a class of employers in
the Community Services and Disability Sector, within various South Australian
Industrial Classifications, including SAWIC 830401 Residential Care
Services nec, 489501 Antique and Used Good [
] Retailing nec, 815601
Community Health Centres nec, 830506 Charities and Community Centres nec, and
830501 Welfare and Charitable
services nec.
Each employer within the class has received a decision fixing or assessing a
premium (“the decision”), an example of which
is attached
At least 20 employers who have sought our support consider that the decision
as to the fixing or assessment of the premium is unreasonable
and request that
the Board review the decision on application under Section 72M of the Act.
In particular, the industry premium rate and the Experience Rating System,
including the method of calculation of the industry claims
cost rate, both
initial and hindsight, and the employer claims cost rate and the effect of the
penalty for employers which incur
claims costs being disproportionate to the
claims costs, are unreasonable.
Information has been, and further documentation will be, sought from the
WorkCover Corporation relevant to this matter. Further particulars
of the basis
for the application will be provided once the information and documentation is
to hand and following the procurement
of any expert’s report.
This correspondence is, and should be taken to be, an application under
Section 72M of the Act for review of the decision.
of the letter reflects the wording of section 72M of the Act, which provides as
(1) If an employer considers that a decision of the Corporation as
(a) the estimate of remuneration that is to be used for the calculation of a
statutory payment; or
(b) the fixing or assessment of a statutory payment; or
(c) the imposition of penalty interest or a fine; or
(d) the imposition or variation of a condition of a kind that may lead to
the remission or imposition of a supplementary payment,
is unreasonable, the board must, on application by the employer, review the
(2) An application for review does not suspend a liability to pay a
statutory payment, penalty interest or a fine.
(3) The review will be conducted, in accordance with procedures determined
by the board, by the board itself, or by a committee or
person to whom the board
has delegated its powers of review under this section, and the board has an
absolute discretion as to whether
it will permit the employer or a
representative of the employer to be heard orally on the review.
(4) On review, the board may—
(a) alter an estimate of remuneration;
(b) alter a statutory payment or an assessment;
(c) quash or reduce penalty interest or a fine;
(d) direct the repayment of amounts overpaid;
(e) quash or vary a condition imposed by the Corporation.
(5) An application under this section for review of a decision of the
Corporation—
(a) must, if the decision relates to a class of employers, be made within 4
months after notice of the decision was given; or
(b) must, if the decision relates to an individual employer, be made within
2 months after the employer was given notice of the decision,
unless the board (or its delegate) allows an extension of time for making the
application.
Panel is the Board’s delegate for the purpose of a review under section
WorkCover Premium Review Panel Determination 2012
Australian Government Gazette
, 10 May 2012, p.1617). It is to be noted that
the 2012 Determination has recently been superseded by a new
Premium Review Panel Determination 2014
South Australian Government
, 10 July 2014, p.3200), but clause 1 of Part 9 of that Determination
provides that the 2012 Determination continues to apply to an
application lodged
before 26 May 2014.
was clearly important to ascertain the identity of the employers said to be
joining in the application. Section 72M seems to contemplate
applications by
multiple applicants joining together (see subsection (5)(a)), but it certainly
does not provide for anything analogous
to the class actions seen overseas, or
even the representative proceedings pioneered in this country by Part IVA of the
Federal Court of Australia Act 1976
, inserted in 1991, or the
representative actions authorised under Division 3 of Part 1 of Chapter 5 of the
Supreme Court Civil Rules 2006
. An application under section 72M may not
need to be confined to a single applicant, but a review can hardly proceed
before this
Panel without the Panel, not to mention the respondent WorkCover,
knowing who the applicant or applicants are.
made this clear to the parties when the application came before me for
directions, and after, no doubt, consultation with the member
organisations that
had originally expressed grievances, SACOSS lodged a list of thirteen member
organisations that had given their
consent to be included as applicants,
including SACOSS itself. I entertain little doubt that SACOSS, as the umbrella
group for community
sector organisations, is an appropriate body to organise its
members’ representations in matters of this sort.
obtaining that list, I have requested the registry to obtain copies of the
assessment for 2012-2013 in each case, which I take
to be the reviewable
decisions complained of. If I am incorrect in that assumption, I leave it to the
applicants to correct me in
due course. My reason for obtaining those copies was
to gain an idea of the scope of the review sought. The application, as set out
above, refers to five specific industry classifications, but preceded by the
word “including”. I thought it might be
relevant to inform myself of
the total number of classifications potentially impugned. From what has been
said at directions hearings,
my impression is that the applicants will challenge
each and every classification applicable to any of them; again, if I am not
in that impression, the applicants can correct me in due
The applicants and the industry classifications applicable to
applicants and the industry classifications applicable to them, as set out in
the 2012-2013 assessments, each dated 15 August
2012, except in the case of
SACOSS itself, the assessment for which is dated 16 July 2012, are as

is a total of 23 separate industry classifications (by my manual count) over 226
different locations. Twelve of the industry

while as many as 74 locations are classified as

. Variability in activities between different employers does not
seem to me to be any more striking than variability within individual
organisations. I draw no particular significance from these observations at this
Questions before me for directions
parties have been in discussion about this application for a considerable time,
indeed, apparently, even before the application
was lodged. For much of the time
that the matter has been before me for directions hearings, the parties have
been at loggerheads
Broadly, WorkCover as respondent has sought details of the case it is expected
to meet, while the applicants has maintained that it is unable to formulate its
case with any precision until WorkCover discloses
the basis on which the
decisions, by which I take it is meant the decisions on the percentages
allocated to each classification,
the parties came no closer together, I asked them to pose to me in writing
preliminary issues, and directions each of them considered
appropriate to
progress the proceedings, and to prepare brief written outlines or arguments in
support of their positions and in
relation to each other’s position.
Wait of the Crown Solicitor’s Office, for WorkCover, identified the
preliminary issues WorkCover sought to have determined
Whether the Act
permits and therefore whether the Panel has jurisdiction to determine a review
brought by a class of applicants?
Whether it is
appropriate for the Panel to make orders for the disclosure sought by the
applicant against WorkCover in the absence
of the particulars of the application
for review?
WorkCover contends that the first issue is
appropriate for determination on a preliminary basis because it goes to the
then the matter may not proceed. The second issue is also appropriate
preliminary determination because it is interlocutory in nature and the
resolution of this issue will guide the proper conduct
of the review.
Wait’s outline continued (headings and some footnotes
2. On 6 December 2013, the Panel directed the Applicants
to define the parameters of its application for review. The Applicants undertook
to do so by correspondence within 14 days. No such correspondence has been
forthcoming. The Applicants now refer to their letter
of 6 December 2013 as
providing adequate clarification. That letter was before the Panel when it
directed the Applicants to provide
further and better particulars.
3. It remains unclear upon what basis the Applicants seek a review under s
72M of the Act. The Applicants state at paragraph [7] of
their outline that they
seek to review ‘the processes involved in the setting of the premium,
including the processes referred
to in ss 68, 69, 70, 71 and 72(1) of the
4. Accordingly the review sought by the Applicants would appear to
(a) A challenge to the placing of each Applicant in an employer category
under s 68 of the Act, potentially including challenges to:
validity of the Regulations establishing the categories pursuant to s 68(1) of
criteria established by WorkCover for the differentiation of small, medium and
large employers;
calculation of each of the Applicants’ aggregate base premium;
purported decision under s 68(2) of the Act to assign any given applicant to a
different category.
(b) a challenge to a decision under s 69 to
place each Applicant in a class of industry, potentially based upon allegations
different SAWIC class is appropriate for any given Applicant;
different predominant class of industry should be assigned to any given
Applicant employing workers in different classes of industry;
is no appropriate SAWIC classifications for any given Applicant and that the
list of SAWIC classifications should be notionally
accordingly.
(c) A challenge to the 18 applicable industry premium
rates set pursuant to s 70(1) of the Act in respect of each of the 18
SAWIC classes.
(d) A challenge to a decision to make the
WorkCover Premium Order
(Experience Rating System) 2012-13
under s 71(2) and (3) of the Act, or some
aspect of the premium order, potentially including but not limited to challenges
‘method of calculation of the industry claims cost rate, both initial and
hindsight’;
general method of calculating the ‘employer claims cost rate’;
correctness of the actual calculations used to calculate the employer claims
cost rate for each applicant, but without specifying
upon what basis, for
example whether they allege that there are excluded costs which may have been
(e) A general challenge to the premiums on the basis that
they are ‘not explicable by reference to the criteria set out in Division
4 of the Act’. A challenge of this breadth could incorporate many other
decisions taken by WorkCover.
In each case, it is not clear whether the challenge is substantive or
procedural, or whether the challenge is to the validity of a
step taken or the
merits of a decision.
5. The Panel’s jurisdiction is established by the terms of the
delegation in the
Premium Review Panel Determination 2012
. The Panel has
been delegated the Board’s functions under s 72M in reviewing a decision
of WorkCover pursuant to a list of
enumerated sections of the Act. Without
understanding the nature of the challenge that the Applicants seek to pursue, it
is not possible
for the Panel to be satisfied that it has jurisdiction to
6. The Panel has the power to order the production of evidence to it in order
to assist it in reviewing a
For the following
reasons, orders for the production of evidence are inappropriate in the present
circumstances.
7. WorkCover has already provided various documents to the Applicants to
assist them to formulate a case for review. In the absence
particularisation in order to narrow the scope of the dispute, it is submitted
that further disclosure would be oppressive.
8. In considering whether to exercise its power to compel production the
Panel should have regard to the objects of the Act, which
include ‘to
provide for the efficient and effective administration of the scheme’ and
‘to reduce litigation and
adversarial contests to the greatest possible
extent’. Similarly Parliament, in introducing the precursor of s 72M
Bill, referred to the ‘danger’ of the review of levies
‘becoming unduly
legalistic’.
Proceedings
before the Panel should not involve extended interlocutory processes of
disclosure.
9. It is open for an employer to rely upon the final assessment
simpliciter
as the relevant
However, a review of the
premium assessment which an employer has received can be conducted without any
need for disclosure. The
Panel on review will apply the terms of the Act, the
premium provisions and the relevant premium order to determine the correct and
appropriate premium. The premium assessment itself sets out the basis for the
calculation and the values used by WorkCover. The employer
may decide to lead
evidence challenging these values. Similarly, the employer may seek to
persuade the Panel to exercise any of the discretions vested in WorkCover
which it has a discretion to review, for example a remission
under s 72C of the
10. Documents relating to the process followed by WorkCover in assessing the
premium at first instance, including in exercising or
declining to exercise any
relevant discretion, are irrelevant on a
11. Therefore, unless an employer can point to specific material that appears
to be relevant to the review, there will ordinarily
be no need for disclosure
12. If disclosure orders are sought in this proceeding, the Applicants must
provide sufficient particulars in order to identify a
‘decision’ as
to the assessment of the premium, the review of which will necessitate
disclosure. The Applicants must
identify the documents which are said to be
relevant, and the basis for that relevance. This will enable the Panel, on an
basis, to make tailored orders for the production of such evidence as
may be necessary for the review.
13. It is not sufficient for the Applicants to simply assert that their
premiums are too high and thereby seek to require that WorkCover
go through an
exhaustive process of producing every document bearing upon the premium,
including documents underlying the decision
to make the relevant WorkCover
premium orders.
14. This approach indicates that the Applicants are engaging in a fishing
expedition. It is well settled that in the exercise of the
analogous power to
order disclosure, courts will not ordinarily order disclosure until a plaintiff
has particularised their claim.
Disclosure should not be ordered for the purpose
of determining whether there may be a case to mount; rather disclosure is
appropriate
to furnish the parties with evidence to show whether the case that
has been articulated has in fact been made out.
15. In correspondence, counsel for the Applicants has asserted that they
require the disclosure ‘in order to be in an informed
position as to
whether to seek the reviews in relation to the premium that has been
‘ (emphasis added). The Applicants do not seek disclosure to
make out a case. They seek disclosure to determine whether they
have a case for
review at all.
16. Proceedings on behalf of multiple applicants have been brought before in
order to agitate a single common
In this case, it is not
apparent that there is a common
issue. There is, therefore, no benefit in a single proceeding.
17. The Applicants are classified across 18 different SAWIC classifications.
Any dispute about the appropriate SAWIC classification
cannot raise a common
18. The purported challenge to the Experience Rating System is not a common
issue. SACOSS is not subject to the
WorkCover Premium Order (Experience
Rating System) 2012-13
18. Those challenges which the Panel has jurisdiction to entertain appear to
involve questions about the appropriate cost of claims
allocated to each
applicant. This may involve the disclosure of information regarding the physical
or mental condition and personal
circumstances of workers. While the Panel, as a
review authority, may permit such
disclosure,
the confidentiality of
workers should be maintained where possible.
the outline submitted on behalf of the applicants, Mr Rossi set out the history
of the application from the applicants’ point
1. By letter dated 14 December 2012 addressed to the Board
of Management of the WorkCover Corporation of SA (“the Board”),
application was made pursuant to s72M of the Workers Rehabilitation and
Compensation Act, 1986 (“the Act”) for a review
of the decision of
the Corporation, in relation to each Applicant, for the fixing or assessment of
a statutory payment as referred
to in s72M(1)(c) of the Act.
2. The identification of each separate Applicant generally referred to as
“employers” in the letter of SACOSS to the Board
dated 14 December
2012 was clarified by letter of Rossi Legal to the WorkCover Corporation of
South Australia (“WorkCover”)
dated 6 December 2013.
3. The applicants applied after receipt of an initial premium calculation for
the period 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 together with
a calculation summary from
4. Following receipt of the initial premium calculation and calculation
summary the Applicants considered, in accordance with s72M(1)
of the Act, that
the fixing of assessment of a statutory payment by way of premium was
unreasonable.
5. In the circumstances, the Board must, on application by the Applicant
employers pursuant to s72M of the Act, review the decision
in relation to the
fixing or assessment of statutory payment by way of premium in the case of each
6. The Board has not, to date, reviewed the decisions with respect to the
imposition of premium concerning the Applicants.
7. Insofar as WorkCover seeks clarification from the Applicants of the basis
of the application for review, WorkCover was directed,
by letter dated 6
December 2013 from the solicitors for the Applicant[s] to the processes involved
in the setting of the premium
including the processes referred to in ss68, 69,
70, 71 and 72(1) of the Act.
8. The Applicants have by correspondence including by letter of SACOSS to
WorkCover dated 3 May 2013 and by letter of the solicitors
for the Applicants to
WorkCover dated 6 December 2013 requested disclosure from the Corporation with
respect to documents relevant
to the setting of the premium so as to be in a
position to determine what further particulars of their applications may be
appropriate.
9. The Applicants agree with the position of the WorkCover Corporation as set
out in the letter of the Crown Solicitor’s Office
dated 30 May 2014, that
the Panel does have jurisdiction to make orders for the disclosure of documents
sought by the Applicants
and the Panel should proceed to do so.
the hearing, Mr Doyle SC and Mr Wait addressed me in detail in amplification of
their outlines. I am grateful to them both. Mr
Doyle emphasised that the
applicants had limited information as to what had occurred in the assessment
process. For example, they
do not know how the SAWIC percentages are determined.
He also said that the Industry Claims Cost Rate (ICCR) that forms a component
the premium cannot be verified by an individual employer. He contended that the
right of review was only meaningful if an employer
can “get behind these
numbers”. There was an apprehension of error in the disparity between the
stated aims of the new
(2012) system and “the end result of soaring
seems to me the principles involved are fairly clear but, to an extent, are
somewhat in competition in this case. There can be
no doubt that a respondent to
a proceeding, and I think it is fair to assume “proceeding” is an
appropriate word to use,
is entitled to understand the case it is expected to
meet. It also seems uncontroversial that a body in receipt of an administrative
decision, especially one imposing a statutory payment in the nature of a
, is entitled to information
it to understand the decision.
consider it also uncontroversial that a body exercising jurisdiction such as
that conferred by section 72M of the Act ought not
routinely lend itself to
extended interlocutory processes, although that principle must be applied
consistently with the interests
of justice.
Panel has always attempted to provide a user-friendly forum for the resolution
of disputes over premiums (previously levies)
between employers and WorkCover.
Many employers are not represented by legal counsel and the Panel makes its own
endeavours to draw
out their “best case”. There is no provision for
the recovery of costs by applicants, whether successful or not, and
recognition of this the Panel usually directs that books of documents be
prepared by WorkCover albeit with input from applicants.
There are no elaborate
procedural rules, and the Panel tries to manage caseflow by more informal means
through directions hearings.
It is to be noted that even in courts subject to
more formal case management principles, the High Court, in
Queensland v. JL Holdings
[1997] HCA 1
(1997) 189 CLR 146
“Case management is not an end in itself. It is an
important and useful aid for ensuring the prompt and efficient disposal of
litigation. But it ought always to be borne in mind, even in changing times,
that the ultimate aim of a court is the attainment of
justice and no principle
of case management can be allowed to supplant that aim.” [per Dawson,
Gaudron and McHugh JJ]
“Whilst taking all of the considerations relevant to the circumstances
of the case into account, the judge must always be careful
to retain that
flexibility which is the hallmark of justice. New considerations for the
exercise of judicial discretion in such cases
have been identified in recent
years. But the abiding judicial duty remains the same. A judge who ignores the
modern imperatives
of the efficient conduct of litigation may unconsciously work
an injustice on one of the parties, or litigants generally, and on
the public.
But a judge who applies case management rules too rigidly may ignore the
fallible world in which legal disputes arise
and in which they must be
resolved.” [per Kirby J].
Doe v. National Australia Bank
[1999] SASC 124
, at [102] per
“The principles of caseflow management are now
important principles underlying the procedural rules. Of course those
cannot be applied so as to prevent a party from litigating an issue
which is fairly arguable. Case management cannot ordinarily
be used to prevail
over the injustice of shutting out a party from an arguable case.”
United Motors Retail v. AGC
(1991) 58 SASR 156
per King CJ:
“Important as the observance of those principles is for the discharge
of a court's responsibilities to the community, it is
not the only
consideration. The effect of any order upon the parties and the risk of
injustice must also be considered. ...
“It will always be necessary for the court, however, to take all
factors into account. The necessity for the amendment or postponement
from causes which involve no fault on the part of the applicant or its legal
representatives. In such cases the need to
do justice to the party will
ordinarily take precedence over policy considerations. ...
“Here again the need to do justice to the party will ordinarily
prevail. There are other cases in which the impact upon a party
of a refusal of
an amendment or an adjournment, may be so severe, particularly when considered
in relation to the nature of the neglect
or other conduct which has brought the
situation about, that the court will feel it necessary to subordinate the policy
considerations
for the need to avoid such impact.”
Panel, therefore, while extending every courtesy and attempting to maintain the
utmost respect for the rights of all parties coming
before it, must always bear
in mind the paramountcy of the interest of justice. Extended interlocutory
processes may be undesirable
in such a jurisdiction, and to be avoided in
principle, but if the interests of justice demand those processes, an exception
the present case, as I see it, there is something of the flavour of a
“fishing expedition” about the applicants’
case as it has been
presented to date. It is somewhat revealing that in their solicitor’s
letter to the Crown Solicitor as
late as 6 February this year the applicants are
seeking “to be in an informed position as to whether to seek the reviews
relation to the premium that has been charged.” It is understood that
in a context where fairly short time limits apply for
the making of
applications, and with WorkCover increasingly tending to take the point, there
is an inevitability about applicants,
in some circumstances, lodging
applications for review before they have formulated their grounds in detail. But
they must have some
idea why they are lodging the applications beyond thinking
their premiums are “excessive and unreasonable”. There must
the premiums are thought to be “excessive and
unreasonable”.
the other hand, it is hardly likely that the applicants have a better idea than
I do of what documents exist so that they can be
requested with specificity, and
I have to confess to ignorance of what sort of documents are brought into
existence by WorkCover
in the process of setting industry rates, etc. I do not
know whether to expect that there would be papers discussing the merits of
setting the rates for individual industries at certain levels, with or without
reference to particular employers within those industries,
or whether such
documentation is confined to an outline of a mathematical, actuarially
determined, proposed schedule. If the latter,
are there documents explaining how
the proposal has been reached? I do not know, and all the indications are that
the applicants
do not know either.
said that, I remain uncertain whether the industry (SAWIC) percentages are the
focus of the application for review. After all,
most of the classifications
affecting the applicants have been relatively stable for several years. As an
example, the classification
814301 Personal Care Services
, under which 74
locations conducted by 9 of the applicants are categorised, was at 7.1% in
2003-2004 (when it was styled
814301 Nursing or convalescent homes providing
nursing or medical care
Leveda v. WorkCover (No.2)
[2004] SAWLRP 6)
, rose to 7.5% in 2004-2005, stayed at 7.5% until 2011-2012,
dropped to 7.4% in 2012-2013, dropped again to 7.1% in 2013-2014 and,
completeness, has been fixed at 6.887% for 2014-2015. The classification
830501 Welfare and Charitable Services nec
, which affects 60 workplaces
conducted by 8 of the applicants, was at 2.7% in 2003-2004, 2.9% in 2004-2005,
3.3% in 2005-2006, 3.6%
in 2006-2007 and 2007-2008, 3.8% in 2008-2009, 3.9% in
2009-2010, 3.1% in 2010-2011, 3.4% in 2011-2012, 3.7% in 2012-2013 and
and 3.685% in 2014-2015. The classification
830401 Residential
Care Services nec
, affecting 39 workplaces conducted by 6 of the applicants,
was fixed at 5.1% in 2003-2004 (when it was styled as
830401 Welfare and
Charitable Homes nec
), remained at 5.1% in 2004-2005, 5.3% from 2005-2006 to
2008-2009, 5.2% in 2009-2010, 4.6% in 2010-2011 and 2011-2012, 4.8% in
5.1% in 2013-2014 and 5.075% in 2014-2015. As one further example,
489501 Antique and Used
affecting 14 workplaces conducted by two of the applicants, the rate was fixed
at 3% in 2003-2004, 3.1% in 2004-2005, 3.4% in 2005-2006,
3.3% in 2006-2007,
3.4% in 2007-2008, 3.7% in 2008-2009, 3.8% in 2009-2010, 3.2% in 2010-2011, 4%
in 2011-2012, 4.1% in 2012-2013,
4% in 2013-2014, and 3.959% in 2014-2015.
on the basis of those examples, it can be observed that the changes in industry
rates in 2012-2013 (the assessments sought to
be reviewed) by comparison with
the previous year are small, and go in both directions. The applicants are
presumably not to be taken
to be complaining about the small
industry rate for
814301 Personal Care Services
in the subject year,
unless, of course, they intend to mount an argument that there is reason why the
reduction should have been
my opinion, the applicants should be required to state with some particularity
the grounds on which they consider the assessments
they have received to be
unreasonable. To do so would be in the applicants’ own best interests;
otherwise, the review the Panel
must conduct as delegate of the Board will be
unfocused and it is less likely the outcome will be satisfactory to the
applicants.
In particular, the Panel will have difficulty seeking relevant
documents from WorkCover, because it will be hard for the Panel, or
matter WorkCover, to know what is relevant. An exercise which consists of little
more than verifying the mathematical accuracy
of WorkCover’s calculations,
without grounds for looking further, would be of little value to anyone. The
application was made
by, or on behalf of, the applicants, and it does not seem
unreasonable to expect them to state in some detail why it was lodged.
the same time, I consider WorkCover should be required to produce documents
bearing on the rates these applicants have been charged:
in particular, any
papers which specifically discuss all or any of the classifications to which the
applicants’ workplaces
are subject, or which discuss all or any of the
applicants themselves or their workplace locations. If no such documents exist,
should produce any documents that explain how proposals for the rates
to be recommended for
by the Board are developed.
do not overlook the fact that the application for review referred not only to
the applicants’ industry rates, but to the Experience
Rating System and
associated concepts, the ICCR and the ECCR as well. The Experience Rating System
appears in a premium order published
, in this case the
WorkCover Premium Order (Experience Rating System) 2012-13
published in
South Australian Government Gazette
, 28 June 2012, at p.2909. ICCR
and ECCR, both initial and hindsight, are defined in some of the formulae
contained in that premium
order, which leads to the phenomenon the application
for review described as “the penalty for employers which incur claims
costs”. I acknowledge Mr Wait’s submission that SACOSS itself is not
subject to the Experience Rating System, but I take
it from the specificity of
that submission that the other member groups are. If there are background
documents discussing the development
and merits of the System that can
conveniently be produced, particularly any that refer to any of the subject
classifications or,
moreover, any of the applicants, they should also be
both by the applicants and by me, of the material referred to in the previous
paragraphs may lead to requests for further
material, but this should be a
reasonable start and not too oppressive for WorkCover. I wish to avoid seeking
the proverbial truckload
of documents if at all possible.
I should like to draw to the attention of the parties the decision published by
the Panel in the matter of
SkyCity Adelaide v. WorkCover
, after this matter was argued, in which the Panel concluded that the
scope of a review under section 72M did not include the re-drawing
schedule of percentages fixed in respect of industry rates under section 70(1),
as it now is. There was a suggestion that
judicial review might have been sought
in relation to that decision, which is part of the reason I have delayed these
reasons, but
this appears not to have occurred and the parties will need to deal
with that decision as it stands.
also remind the parties of the Panel’s decision in
[2014] SAWPRP 3
, in which the Panel pointed out that there was
no provision for the charitable objects of an employer to be taken into account
ameliorate their statutory obligations under the Act.
WorkCover has furnished whatever documents exist in the categories outlined by
] above, and the applicants have
furnished particulars of their grounds of application, it should become apparent
whether argument
is necessary on the effect of
SkyCity Adelaide v.
[2014] SAWPRP 4
before this matter proceeds further.
Confidentiality of documents
also point out that, although a disclosure required by a review authority is
specifically permitted by section 112(2)(d) of the
Act, any information
otherwise protected by section 112(1) does not necessarily, by being so
disclosed, lose that protection in relation
to further disclosures. Therefore,
any confidential information disclosed to the applicants as a result of my order
should, and I
have no doubt will, be held closely by Mr Doyle SC, Mr Rossi, and
those directly instructing them. (This particularly applies if,
stage, it emerges that there is any issue about the claims history of any
applicant and documents are disclosed relating
to any individual worker.) As
section 112(1) is a penal provision, I should avoid, if possible, expressing a
view as to whether “commercial
or trading operations” in that
subsection can be construed to include operations of a statutory corporation
(i.e., WorkCover).
I simply urge discretion.
“Class action”
relation to Mr Wait’s point about “a review brought by a class of
applicants”, I consider I have dealt with the
point in my introductory
remarks at [
] above. An application
joined by multiple applicants is not the same as a “class action” as
commonly understood. I take
no exception to the application having been lodged
as it was, but I also acknowledge that it may emerge subsequently that there is
a lack of commonality on some issues. For example, 16 of the classifications I
set out at [
] affect only one
applicant. If it becomes necessary at a later stage of these proceedings to
separate issues that are significant
to only one or two applicants, that
question can be addressed at that time. For now, it seems convenient to allow
the application
to proceed with the support of all applicants.
Pursuant to my delegated powers under the Act, I direct WorkCover, within 28
days of receipt of this direction, to disclose to the
applicants (through their
solicitor) and to the Panel any documents falling within [
further direct the applicants, within 28 days of receipt of compliance or
purported compliance by WorkCover with that requirement,
lodge with the
registry, and serve on the Crown Solicitor, a statement of the basis on which
the applicants consider the assessments
they have received to be unreasonable,
with as much particularity as possible.
there are any practical difficulties presented by compliance with these
directions, I will call the matter back on at short notice
on request of either
party. In the absence of any such request, I will re-list the matter for further
directions when I become aware
that the directions above have been
