What are we sharing with online private messaging and social media platforms?
What are we sharing with
online private messaging and social media platforms?

In September 2020, the ACCC released Digital Platforms Services Inquiry
Interim Report on Online Private Messaging
In the interim report, one of the key findings from the ACCC is around data
collection, data tracking and limited choices and controls
of consumer’s
The ACCC finds that Australians’ online activity is being extensively
tracked, with large platforms including Facebook and Google
key recipients of
this data. Online private messaging services collect a broad range of user
information through technologies such
as cookies, pixels and other tracking
technologies.
What’s worse, is that some online private messaging services did not
clearly outline the extent to which a consumer is tracked
for the purpose of
online advertising. The use of the information for advertising purposes is not
made clear to consumers. Almost
all the platforms described the benefits of
enabling cookies in their Cookies Statement, emphasising the importance of
improve products or for user convenience and discouraging consumers
from deleting or disabling cookies. But there is little mention
disadvantages and how intrusive these tracking technologies can be.
Often, consumers are left in the dark about how the collected information
gets used and shared, and how long is the information retained
In one example provided, an ACCC staff member requested their WhatsApp
account information in July 2020. The information kept and
stored by WhatsApp
includes their mobile phone number, profile photo, device details (e.g. device
model, manufacturer), network provider,
current IP address and previous IP
addresses. They found that WhatsApp had the mobile phone numbers of all of their
350), and the names of every chat group they were a part of
(which included group chats with family and friends). WhatsApp also stored
information about their settings, including the phone numbers of the contacts
they had blocked, and whether they were active on a
WhatsApp desktop
The WhatsApp example is only one tip of the iceberg. The aggregated insights
built overtime by technology giants such as Google and
Facebook is beyond
comprehension. It is one thing to know Facebook knows what you are posting and
sharing on the platform, and quite
a different thing to know all the user
activities are being accumulated and analysed overtime by Facebook to build an
portfolio for each user, and such aggregated insights could be shared
with third parties for target advertising and marketing purposes.
In other words, social media platforms may not be sharing your exact name and
email to a third party, but they share insights about
you such as where you have
been, your favourite foods, you frequently visited restaurants and shops, so
that these third parties
know your preferences and interests, and be able to
send you feeds or marketing ads appealing to these interests.
But consumers had limited understanding of what they consented to. Most
people didn’t know their data is being widely shared
to other third
The issue is even more prevalent with new products and services, including
voice assistants, and augmented and virtual reality services,
which allow for an
increased ability to collect data on consumers. A large amount of audio is being
picked up by voice assistants
such as Amazon Echo because some “wake
words” can casually appear in a normal conversation.
As large platforms such as iOS, Android, Facebook and Google expand their
ecosystems, the ACCC also has concerns that growing ecosystems
potential to affect competition as a larger platform can easily provide
complementary products and services to attract more
consumers, and be able to
collect more data without anyone’s knowledge. Consumers often think they
are sending a private message
on Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp and forget the
fact that all the conversations are shared with the platform service
A picture is worth a thousand words. Equally, you can combine tens of
thousands data elements together to paint a complete picture.
Digital Platforms Services Inquiry Interim Report on Online Private Messaging is
only the first step to call for
better transparency, choices and controls for
consumers. Consumers need to be better informed before they join a particular
and they have a right to say no to particular data collection and data
sharing practices. From a legislative perspective, we need
to better define the
realm of personal information if small pieces of unidentified data can be
aggregated to identify a person, and
take a closer look at what is being
collected by new technologies.
