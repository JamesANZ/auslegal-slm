Adam Low v Manchester Roofing Pty Ltd [2009] QIC 24; 191 QGIG 325 (16 July 2009)
[Extract from Queensland Government Industrial
dated 24 July, 2009, Vol. 191, No. 11, pages
INDUSTRIAL COURT OF QUEENSLAND
Workplace Health and
Safety Act 1995
- s. 164(3) - appeal against decision of industrial
Adam John Low AND Manchester Roofing Pty Ltd (C/2009/8)
PRESIDENT HALL
16 July 2009
Matter No. C/2009/8 was an appeal against the quantum of a fine imposed upon
Manchester Roofing Pty Ltd by an Industrial Magistrate
at Cleveland. The fine
was said to be inadequate. The Appeal failed. Manchester Roofing Pty Ltd now
seeks an award of costs pursuant
to s. 335(1)(a) of the
Industrial Relations
The decision of this Court dismissing the Appeal
is reported at
[2009] QIC 15
191 QGIG 63.
It is apparent from the reasoning, that given this
Court's limited authority to interfere with the exercise of a discretion by an
Industrial Magistrate, given the admitted facts and given the state of the
authorities (which the Appellant did not seek to review),
that the Appeal had no
prospect of success. Further, it seems to me that the Appeal was recognisable
as an appeal with no prospect
of success. In those circumstances the Appeal was
made "without reasonable cause" for the purposes of s. 335(1)(a) of the Act.
accept that some of the remarks which fell from the Industrial Magistrate appear
to overstate the weight to be given to the mitigating
factors of a prompt plea
and cooperation with investigators. However, the Industrial Magistrate's
decision did not give excessive
weight to those matters and the Appeal to this
Court was not argued on the basis of His Honours' remarks. The operation of s.
of the Act where an appellant seeks to correct reasons rather than the
outcome may be left for another day.
I order the Appellant forthwith to
pay to the Respondent the Respondent's costs of and incidental to the Appeal to
this Court. In
the absence of agreement, costs are to be assessed by the
Industrial Registrar as costs would be assessed on a Supreme Court Matter.
