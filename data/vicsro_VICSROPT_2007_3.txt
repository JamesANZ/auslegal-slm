Contractors - Services not ordinarily required (PT-130) [2007] VICSROPT 3 (1 May 2007)
Revenue Rulings
Pay-roll Tax Act 1971
deems a person (whether incorporated or not) who
entered into a `relevant contract' with a business (the
principal) to be an employee of the principal, and
payments made to such persons to be wages for the
purposes of the Act. Deemed wages under
of the Act are subject to pay-roll tax.
While most contracts for the provision for services
come within the meaning of `relevant contracts'
of the Act, there are certain types
of contracts that are specifically excluded from the
definition of `relevant contracts'. One of the exclusions
is a contract which provides services that are not
ordinarily required by the principal and the contractor
ordinarily renders services of that kind to the public
(section 3(C)(1)(e)(i)
of the Act).
The purpose of this Revenue Ruling is to explain the
criteria that must be met for a contract to be excluded
section 3(C)(1)(e)(i)
of the Act.
From time to time, businesses require certain services
that are not associated with their mainstream business
and it is more practical to engage contractors who
ordinarily render similar services to the public,
instead of permanent staff to perform these services.
According to
section 3(C)(1)(e)(i)
of the Act, a contract
providing such services is not a `relevant contract' if
the following two criteria are met:
1) the services provided by the contractor are not
ordinarily required by the principal. Generally, this
means services that are not related to the main
business of the principal (e.g. services provided
by painters and decorators engaged by a bank to
paint and decorate its office), and
2) the contractor must ordinarily provide the services
in question to the public generally. To satisfy this
criterion, the contractor would need to have derived
less than 40 per cent of gross trading income from
the principal during the relevant financial year.
For the purposes of this Revenue Ruling, gross trading
income is the gross income earned by the contractor in
the conduct of the contractor's business excluding any
investment income or wages.
Where the above criteria are not satisfied but you
believe that the exclusion should apply to your
contract, you may apply for a private ruling to the
Commissioner of State Revenue in accordance with
Revenue Ruling GEN.009.
Please note that rulings do not have the force of
law. Each decision made by the State Revenue
Office is made on the merits of each individual
case having regard to any relevant ruling. All
rulings must be read subject to Revenue Ruling
