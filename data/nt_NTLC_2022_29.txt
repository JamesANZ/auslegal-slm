REASONS FOR DECISION
(Delivered 22 December
ACTING JUDGE O’LOUGHLIN
Introduction
Applicant has applied for personal violence restraining orders against the King
Charles III, the Administrator of the Northern
Territory (NT), the NT
Attorney-General, the NT Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Services, the
NT Minister for the Prevention
of Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence, and the
Federal Minister for Indigenous Australians.
Solicitor for the NT appeared for the Administrator and the NT Ministers, and
has applied for summary judgment pursuant to
Local Court (Civil Jurisdiction)
Rule 28.01.
personal violence restraining orders applications are very similar and these
reasons apply to each of the six proceedings.
provides a power for the Court to summarily decide a matter in
certain circumstances:
(1) Where a
proceeding generally or a claim in proceedings:
(a) does not disclose a cause of action;
(b) is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; or
(c) is an abuse of the process of the Court,
the Court may stay the proceedings generally or in relation to a claim or
give judgment in
proceedings generally or in relation to a
Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner of Railways
[1964] HCA 69
(1964) 112 CLR
remains a leading authority on summary judgment where Barwick CJ said at
“... great care must be exercised to ensure that under the guise of
achieving expeditious finality a plaintiff is not improperly
deprived of his
opportunity for the trial of his case by the appointed tribunal. On the other
hand, I do not think that the exercise
of the jurisdiction should be reserved
for those cases where argument is unnecessary to evoke the futility of the
plaintiffs claim.
Argument, perhaps even of an extensive kind, may be necessary
to demonstrate that the case of the plaintiff is so clearly untenable
cannot possibly succeed.”
NT Pubco Pty Ltd v Strazdins
[2014] NTSC 8
, Hiley J at [16] - [17]
summarised the effect of the equivalent Supreme Court Rule in the following
Courts have been reluctant to allow summary determinations; rather,
a party is ordinarily entitled to have its case placed before
the court in the
'ordinary way'. The power under Order 23 is one that should be exercised by a
court with great caution; with the
applicant bearing a heavy burden. It has been
held in this jurisdiction that
will only be enlivened in
circumstances where the plaintiff’s case is so clearly untenable that it
could not possibly succeed
in order to succeed under these provisions for summary relief
[the defendant] must establish that the claims against them are plainly
unsustainable
the merits of the claims will be determined by
Violence Restraining Orders Act 2016
(NT) (“PVRO Act”) which
requires the Applicant to show:
... on the balance of probabilities a personal violence offence has been
committed, or is likely to be committed by the defendant
against the person
whose protection is sought".
“personal violence offence” is defined in section 4 of the PVRO Act
and refers to a number of offences in the
Criminal Code
offences against morality, assault etc.) as well as conduct causing harm,
damaging property, intimidation, stalking and
economic abuse.
September and October 2022, the Applicant filed affidavits to support her
applications pursuant to
Local Court Practice Direction 37.2.
Court has the entirety of the Applicant’s evidence and does not need to
speculate on what evidence
be tendered. Notwithstanding this
advantage of having the actual evidence, I will apply the above principles and
require the Defendant
to satisfy the heavy burden of showing the claims are
plainly unsustainable.
Unfortunately,
the Applicant is not represented by a legal practitioner and her affidavits of
evidence are difficult to follow. Even
after careful reading I have been unable
to find evidence suggesting the Defendants have, or are likely to, commit a
personal violence
offence against the Applicant.
affidavits mostly focus on issues relating to the
Constitution
Applicant’s views on the validity of NT laws, the alleged lack of
health treatment she
received in the NT and ACT.
Barr dealt with very similar jurisdictional arguments in
Kerinaiua v
[2018] NTSC 87
and at [24] found them to be “without
merit”, and I have reached the same conclusion here.
my difficulty in following the affidavits, I have below attempted to identify
those parts which
be regarded as alleging a personal violence
respect of the application against the Federal Minister for Indigenous
Australians, the Applicant alleges the Minister has:
advocated violence and defamation against my person and have deemed me
mentally impaired which has caused harm on my person"
"defamed me
since 1987-2009-2022. This has been recorded in the ACT and NT mental health
with injections that have induced symptoms
of Parkinson's disease
general assertion of advocating violence is without any detail and there is no
suggestion that the Applicant has ever had dealings
with the Federal Minister.
The Applicant also alleges that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
organisations and Land Councils
are practising apartheid that has caused
harm to my mental health, physical health
". This is unlikely to be true, but
even if it was, it is not an act by the Minister for Indigenous Australians. I
find there is
no evidence to suggest the Minister for Indigenous Australians
has, or will, commit a personal violence offence against the Applicant.
respect of King Charles III, the Applicant alleges that he, as head of the
Anglican Church, "murdered aboriginal/indigenous and
stole our land". Again,
even if these historical allegations against the Anglican Church were made out,
it would not be a basis
to conclude that the current head of that church has
committed, is likely to commit, a personal violence offence against the
application against the NT Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Services
nominates the protected person as Laura Hinks, where
it is alleged this Minister
"has no authority or jurisdiction to remove Laura's children" and that the
Minister's agents have “mentally
and physically assaulted Ms Laura
Hinks”. Although the Applicant has taken an interest in this other
proceeding, and Ms Laura
Hinks has been subject to an arrest, there is no
evidence suggesting the Minister has committed or is likely to commit a personal
violence offence against Ms Hinks.
also alleges the Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Services "continues to
attempt to commit me into a mental institution
on the whim of a phone call".
There is no evidence to support this allegation and I also accept the submission
by the Defendant that
this Minister has no role under the
Mental Health and
Related Services Act 1998
respect of the NT Attorney-General where the protected person is again Laura
Hinks, the Applicant alleges that "
the policies and law legislation has
affected the life of Laura Hinks and her children that has put her children in a
dangerous position
". Though not necessary, the Defendant filed affidavit
evidence stating the Attorney-General has had no involvement in Ms Hinks’
proceeding. In any event, there is simply no evidence to suggest a personal
violence offence has been, or will be, committed by
Attorney-General.
could not find any allegation approximating a personal violence offence in the
proceeding Local Court file number 22230463 against
Kate Worden as NT Minister
for the Prevention of Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence.
respect of the Administrator, the Applicant seems to suggest that as
Administrator of the Monarch who is the head of the Anglican Church...
[she] ... murdered the aboriginal/indigenous/original people
and stole their
". This allegation is not evidence of a personal violence offence
having been committed by the Administrator against the Applicant.
summary judgment application was argued on 18 October 2022, where the Applicant
was given two further weeks to file any additional
evidence or submissions in
response to the Defendant's written submissions.
Applicant filed further affidavit evidence on 1 November 2022. That affidavit
raised a number of additional novel legal arguments
“The defendants ...are responsible and complicit for violations
committed by the Australian police forces in particular the
NT police force. The
defendant, Vicki O'Halloran is administrating them via the Minister of Finance.
The Australian police forces
are impersonating Commonwealth officers which is a
punishable crime".
with the reasoning of Barr J in
Kerinaiua v Andreou,
I reject these
propositions.
all of the remaining content of the 1 November 2022 affidavit addressed concerns
which is not relevant, and the
Applicant’s treatment as a patient in the ACT, which is also not
respect of all of the six applications for personal violence restraining orders,
the Applicant has failed to identify one personal
violence offence that has been
committed by any of the named Defendants. There is nothing in the evidence to
suggest that such an
act has been committed or is likely to be committed by any
one of the Defendants. I find the applications are clearly untenable
possibly succeed.
therefore summarily dismiss each of the six applications pursuant to Rule
preliminary view is not to award costs against the Applicant, but I will hear
from the parties if necessary where any application
for costs is to be filed
within 28 days.
Application for a Personal Violence Order in this proceeding 22230461 is
summarily dismissed pursuant to Local Court Rule 28.01;
Applications for Personal Violence Orders in proceedings 22230458, 22230459,
22230460, 22230463, 22230464 are summarily dismissed
pursuant to Local Court
Rule 28.01;
application for costs is to be filed and served within 28 days.
