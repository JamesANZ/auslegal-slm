Coercive control; women’s same-gender
relationships; intimate partner violence.
Introduction
2007, Evan Stark consolidated decades of feminist scholarship and advocacy on
intimate partner violence (IPV) (e.g., Dobash and
Dobash 1979; Pence and Paymar
1993) into a framework he coined “coercive control”
concept that illustrates how heterosexual men subvert and entrap women through a
regime of domination entailing multiple abusive
tactics (Stark 2007). The
stratagems of coercive control described by Stark (2007) include but are not
limited to, bodily violence
(physical and sexual), threats, intimidation,
humiliation, degradation, emotional cruelty
restricting personal territory and freedom, and mind games. The tactics used by
perpetrators are personalised, situational, targeted
at the victim’s
particular vulnerabilities, and will shift over time through a process of trial
and error. Coercive control
will, therefore, manifest differently in each
abusive relationship, but the objective is always the same, namely, to establish
maintain power and control over the victim for the perpetrator’s
benefit (Stark 2009).
Stark’s (2007) model is grounded within a
feminist understanding of patriarchy, namely, the exertion of power and control
men over women (Kelly and Johnson 2008). Androcentric privilege and
masculinist power provide the context within which men’s
abuse of women
can be perpetrated, legitimised, and continued (Kaschak 2001; Stark 2009).
Initially, therefore, Stark’s (2007)
framework of coercive control may
seem inapplicable to women victimised by other women in romantic relationships.
However, the social
context of the nuclear family and patriarchal and
heteronormative values form a foundation for all relationships and are, thus,
to bleed through to LGBTIAQ+ partnerships (Donovan and Hester 2014).
Women’s same-gender intimate relationships are also directly
impacted by
other social structural oppressions arising from masculinist social systems,
namely, homophobia and heterosexism (Campo
and Tayton 2015; Elliott 1996;
Ristock, 2003). The reality of abuse in these relationships are “stories
of invisibility”
(Donovan and Barnes 2020: 9). The dominance of the
stories of heterosexual IPV acts as a barrier to recognition of abuse for both
LGBTIAQ+ themselves and service providers (Donovan and Barnes 2020: 9).
Same-gender attracted women in abusive intimate relationships
may see their
abuse as less harmful or severe than abuse in heterosexual partnerships (Donovan
and Barnes 2019: 561).
Although existing
research demonstrates that coercive control likely has salience for women in
same-gender intimate relationships
(Frankland and Brown 2014; Hayes and Jeffries
2015; Messing et al. 2021; Raghavan, et al. 2019; Whitton, Newcomb et al. 2019),
(2007) framework was initially heteronormative. He later contended
that heteropatriarchy may condition abuse in women’s intimate
relationships with other women but that more research was needed to clearly
understand how coercive control manifests beyond heterosexuality
Hester 2019). In this paper, utilising the voices of 18 IPV victims, we provide
an in-depth qualitative exploration of
coercive control in women’s
same-gender intimate relationships.
in same-gender romantic relationships is not as well understood as in
heterosexual couples. As of 2015, research on lesbian, gay,
or bisexual partner
abuse made up only 3% of the total research in this area (Edwards, Neal and
Sylaska 2015). What has been written
on same-gender IPV tends to focus on
men’s same-gender relationships, is statistical, and frequently fails to
disaggregate
findings by sexual orientation and gender (Balsam 2012; Frankland
and Brown 2014; Lie et al. 1991; Miller et al.
2014; Potoczniak et al. 2003; Rose 2012; Schilit, Lie and Montagne 1990;
Whitton, Dyar et al. 2019). This makes it difficult to draw
inferences about the
specific ways in which coercive control manifests. All this research can do is
provide prevalence estimates
and identify correlates of IPV. Crude estimates
place IPV victimisation rates in women’s same-gender intimate
relationships
as equal to, or greater than, that of heterosexual women.
Sociodemographic factors, personality (e.g., low self-esteem) and relational
characteristics (e.g., co-dependency), prior IPV victimisation, and growing up
in families marred by abuse have been identified as
key correlates
(Badenes-Ribera et al. 2016: 291–292). Homophobia (both internalised and
institutional) is also interwoven into
same-gender attracted women’s abuse
experiences (Donovan and Hester, 2014; Hotten 2011; Tigert 2001).
Currently, there are
no qualitative explorations of coercive control in women’s same-gender
intimate relationships. While there
is qualitative research that suggests
Stark’s (2007) framework has legitimacy in women’s same-gender
romantic partnerships,
no one has specifically examined the tactics of abuse
being employed within these relational contexts (e.g., Lobel 1986; Renzetti
1988, 1992, 1996, 1999; Ristock 2012; Walters 2011). By exploring perpetrator
tactics and specifically situating these within Stark’s
(2007) framework,
the research findings reported in this paper provide a nuanced qualitative
understanding of coercive control IPV
in women’s relationships with other
study is essential and timely because, since Stark (2007) published his book,
several countries have created criminal offences
of coercive control. For
example, England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland have criminalised coercive
control (Women’s Safety
and Justice Taskforce 2021). In Australia, it is
criminalised in Tasmania (
Family Violence Act
) and New South Wales (
Crimes Legislation Amendment (Coercive
Control) Act 2022
), and is shortly to be criminalised in Queensland
Criminal Law
Coercive Control and Affirmative Consent) and Other
Legislation Amendment Act 2023
; Rose et al. in press). Yet, our
understanding of coercive control is predominantly heteronormative and, as such,
there is concern
who are intimately involved with other women (Australian Women Against
Alliance 2021: 13). In Australia, Rugkhla and Dixson (2021) have highlighted the
urgent need for qualitative research on
LGBTIAQ+ peoples’ experiences of
coercive control.
Literature Review
Stark (2009, 2009a) dismisses coercive control as a typology of intimate
partner violence. He argues that, instead, coercive control
is a condition of
entrapment that results from a combination of coercive (violent, threatening, or
intimidating) and controlling
(regulating, depriving, exploiting, or isolating)
tactics (Stark 2009: 229) that indirectly compel obedience (Stark 2009: 205).
coercive control is neither a type of violence nor a typology of violence.
Conceptualising it as such masks the nuanced and deeply
personal manifestation
of coercive control, tailored to exploit the vulnerabilities of survivors. By
sifting through the limited
available studies, using Starks’s
conceptualisations as our starting point, we developed four key groupings of
tactics which
have been reported by same-gender attracted women in abusive
intimate relationships: 1) assault, threats, and intimidation; 2) humiliation,
degradation, and emotional cruelty; 3) restricting personal territory and
freedom; and 4) mind games.
Threats, and Intimidation
Physical and sexual violence can feature in the
tactical toolbox of heterosexual coercive controllers (Murphy 2009, n.d.b; Stark
Both are powerful devices for inciting fear, anxiety, despair, and
subsequent victim compliance (Johnson and Kelly 2010). However,
it is important
to note that actual bodily harm can be absent from coercive and controlling
intimacy (Anderson 2009). This is because
verbal and non-verbal browbeating
alone are excellent ways to engender fear and victim obedience, especially if
assault has been
used in the past (Renzetti 1992; Ristock 2012; Taylor, Fraser
and Riggs 2019). Perpetrators may verbally threaten, for example, to
hurt, disfigure, or kill individual victims, their children, other family
members, new partners, friends, and pets (Taylor
et al. 2019). Threats of
perpetrator self-harm and suicide are also common (Stark 2007: 251). Non-verbal
intimidation can involve
the use of threatening behaviour, facial expressions,
and body language that communicate clearly to victim-survivors that they are
under threat (Murphy n.d.a). Menacing behaviours, such as dangerous driving, are
also common methods of intimidation (Hayes and Jeffries
2015; Ristock 2012).
Within the context of
women’s same-gender IPV, studies show that victim-survivors can experience
physical and sexual abuse alongside
other threatening and intimidating acts. For
example, victim-survivors report having items thrown at them, being menaced with
having their property destroyed, and being verbally threatened with
harm. This behaviour may include threats to kill the victim and
others that the
victim cares for (Donovan and Barnes 2019; Glass et al. 2004; Heintz and
Melendez 2006; Messing et al. 2021; Miller
et al. 2014; Renzetti 1988, 1992,
1999; Ristock 2003; Taylor, Fraser and Riggs 2019; West 2002, 2012). Threats of
suicide and self-harm
are common (Renzetti 1992). Homophobia is also used by
perpetrators who will threaten to out their partners to friends, family, or
employers (Campo and Tayton 2015; Elliott 1996).
Humiliation,
Degradation, and Emotional Cruelty
Heterosexual coercive control studies show that perpetrators frequently use
humiliation, degradation, and emotional cruelty to establish
perpetrator
superiority via the disintegration of victim self-respect, worth, and esteem
(Hennessy 2012: 114; Stark 2007: 258–260).
Common tactics under this
banner include name-calling, put-downs, swearing, spitefulness, comparing the
victim unfavourably to others,
denying victim-survivors their ideas and
opinions, criticising and diminishing their strengths and achievements, telling
their current relationship is as good as they will ever get, and
shaming (Hayes and Jeffries, 2015: 31; Stark 2007: 259–261).
regularly insulted and degraded by a perpetrator is also reported to occur in
women’s same-gender IPV (Donovan and Hester
2014; Renzetti 1992).
Homophobia can be weaponised by perpetrators to demean, shame, and emotionally
harm IPV victim-survivors (Donovan
and Barnes 2019).
Restricting
Personal Territory and Freedom
In coercive and controlling heterosexual relationships, the methods exercised
seek to deprive victim-survivors of social support,
reduce their personal space
and freedom, and crush their self-identity. Victim-survivors become increasingly
dependent on the perpetrator
as their ability to resist is diminished and they
lose their sense of self. Examples of tactics under this heading include social
isolation, financial abuse, and the invasion of personal space and privacy
(Kutin, Russell and Reid 2017; Woodlock 2017). Perpetrators
of coercive control
also work to estrange their partners from loved ones and may weaponise
homophobia to engender co-dependency and
consequent social isolation (Frankland
and Brown 2014; Lockhart et al. 1994; McClennen, Summers and Daley 2002;
Renzetti 1988; West
2002). Isolation may begin innocently, spending quality time
with each other or going everywhere together, and both partners may
closeness and reliance on one another as a response to living in a homophobic
world (Hayes and Jeffries 2015).
Mind games are deliberate attempts at psychological manipulation. They are
covert, coercive, unscrupulous actions masked by everyday-sounding
communication
(Murphy n.d.b). The purpose is to brainwash victim-survivors into compliance.
Perpetrators withhold critical information,
gaslight, lie, minimise, or deny
their abusive actions and cause their partners to question their sanity (Hayes
and Jeffries 2015:
For example, in the early stages of a heterosexual relationship,
love-bombing
is often used. Love-bombing is a grooming tactic involving
repeated and exaggerated signs of affection. These may include constant
flattery, gift-giving, grand romantic gestures, declarations of intense
adoration and love, and expressing a desire for lifelong
commitment (Blyth 2021:
21). This is a particularly insidious form of manipulation because perpetrators
intentionally hijack, and
play into, the survivor’s narrative of romance
for their gain (Hennessy 2012). The presence of love-bombing as a perpetrator
tactic shows that periods of romance, love, and calm are part of a strategy.
Ultimately, these gestures of kindness are revoked by
perpetrators, intermixed
with abusive behaviours, or eliminated (Hennessy 2012). Later, gaslighting,
transference of blame, mixed
messages, and contradictions in perpetrators’
private and public personas can be observed. Taken together, this results in
victim-survivor losing her ability to trust their thoughts. They are, as
Hennessey (2012: 77) states, “like a person who
has been secretly invaded
by a virus and does not know why she is feeling bad”.
Mind games and manipulation have been highlighted in a handful of studies on
lesbian IPV (Elliott 1996; Hart 1986). Early research
into abusive lesbian
relationships revealed that perpetrators withheld critical information from
their partners and enacted gaslighting
behaviour which minimised or denied the
abuse and instilled a sense of insanity (Hayes and Jeffries 2015; Hart 1986;
Peterman and
Dixon 2003). Additionally, same-gender attracted women have
experienced their partners using threats of self-harm or suicide as a
means to control them (Glass et al. 2004; Renzetti 1992).
This research qualitatively examined the narratives of 18 same-gender
attracted women who had experienced same-gender IPV in a total
of 21 abusive
relationships with women. It used a combination of snowball (Maxfield and Babbie
2014), purposive (Patton 2002), and
convenience sampling. A convenience sample
was initially obtained through recruitment flyers and calls for participants
through radio,
website, and social media. Thereafter, snowball sampling was used
to recruit additional women willing to tell their stories.
Ethical clearance was obtained through [removed
for peer review] Human Research Ethics Committee (2016/476) and adhered to the
international
ethical standards for research on domestic violence (World Health
Organisation 2016). Written informed consent was obtained from
all research
participants. To protect confidentiality and anonymity, we assigned a pseudonym
to each research participant and their
intimate partners throughout this paper.
Minor details of women’s stories that had no bearing on the research were
also altered
to protect their anonymity.
Interviews were conducted online, over the
telephone or in person, depending on how the women chose to engage. Some women
sent emails
containing their stories. The interview schedule was open-ended,
with broad discussion topics, allowing participants leeway to express
experiences of IPV on their terms (Schensul, Schensul and LeCompte 1999). More
specifically, participants were asked to discuss
how they met their abuser, to
talk through the progression of the relationship, and to discuss incidents of
“conflict”,
abuse, and harm. Written stories, follow-up questions
and raw interview transcripts were analysed using manual and software-assisted
thematic analysis, whereby patterns or themes that emerge within data are
identified and analysed (Braun and Clarke 2006). This method
of analysing data
was beneficial because it allowed for the identification of several key themes
that illuminated various dynamics
and dimensions of abuse for women in abusive
same-gender relationships.
Overview of the Research Participants
The mean age of interviewees was 34.7 years. At the time of the interviews,
nine women identified as lesbian/gay, five were bisexual
or pansexual, and one
was asexual. The remaining three victim-survivors did not wish to disclose their
current sexual orientation.
Everyone had experienced at least one abusive
same-gender relationship with a woman. Most identified as being cisgender
=14), two were trans women, one was feminine presenting non-binary and
another was a trans man who had lived with IPV as a lesbian
pre-transition. Table 1 provides a summary of critical information relevant to
each survivor, including their pseudonym and
age; the pseudonym of their
partner; and details of the relationship, including relationship length and time
since separation.

Coercively Controlling Tactics
The study participants reported a vast array of coercively controlling
behaviours. These revealed the highly personalised and targeted
coercive control and the weaponisation of internalised and externalised
homophobia in same-gender relationships between
women. The tactics they
experienced reflected the themes we had observed in our literature review and
are presented under the same
headings: 1) assault, threats, and intimidation; 2)
humiliation, degradation, and emotional cruelty; 3) restricting personal
and freedom; and 4) mind games.
Assault, Threats, and Intimidation
Physical violence, sexual abuse, threats, and intimidation—whether
direct, indirect, verbal or non-verbal—are crucial
instruments in the
coercively controlling perpetrator’s arsenal because they provoke dread,
anxiety, despair, and subsequent
compliance in victim-survivors (Renzetti 1992;
Ristock 2012; Stark 2007; Taylor, Fraser and Riggs 2019). Over half the
interviewees
reported experiencing some form of physical harm, including being
choked, pinned down, punched, hit, slapped, pushed, shoved, pinched,
with objects, and having their hair pulled. James described an instance where
his abuser, Elle, punched him in the face,
resulting in a black eye. “Her
fist, it came out of nowhere [and then] she hit me in the head with a snooker
cue, and [my head]
busted wide open. I was knocked unconscious. I had whiplash
for six weeks”.
Some reported non-lethal strangulation, which is recognised as “a risk
factor for future serious harm and death” (Douglas
and Fitzgerld 2022:
271) and has been identified as a powerful tool of coercive control in
same-gender relationships (Messing et
al. 2021). For example, Kelly explained
that her abuser would “squish my windpipe or bruise my neck just
constantly, where
I couldn’t breathe”. Christine was strangled
multiple times throughout her abusive relationship. She described one horrifying
incident in which Jackie “snapped” and “went from the hitting,
punching, and pushing a chair up against me and
pinning me against the
wall” to attempting to asphyxiate her with a lanyard Christine was wearing
around her neck at the time.
Christine said, “she was twisting [the
lanyard] tighter, she kicked the chair out of the way, and her knee went into my
and just kept twisting, kept twisting until I couldn’t scream
Some interviewees relayed having lived with sexually coercive behaviours,
such as being forced to kiss and sexually touch their partner,
and penetration
without consent. Robin made Vicky feel violated by “talking dirty about
her mother and saying how she wanted
to have sex with her”. Vicky
explained that Robin “would threaten to masturbate over my mother unless I
sent her homemade
pornography”. After Vicky sent this to her, Robin used
the “homemade pornography” as another control mechanism
via threats
to post it online if Vicky was recalcitrant.
Rebecca had lost a close friend in a motor vehicle accident involving drink
driving. The distress this caused was exploited by her
girlfriend, Wendy, who
would threaten to drive while under the influence of alcohol if Rebecca refused
to have sex with her. Wendy
would frequently “completely blow up and
scream” at Rebecca “for hours” when she said,
Wendy would say “a whole lot of really nasty things,
being completely hurtful”. One evening, when Rebecca was drunk,
sexually assaulted her while she was asleep and unable to consent.
Hannah frequently used Kelly’s previous sexual encounters with men to
justify assault. Hannah knew Kelly “hated every
minute” of her
heterosexual relationship, and that it was a source of “great shame”
for her. Hannah used this to
make Kelly feel, in her own words:
“disgusting”. In one instance, after forcibly digitally penetrating
Kelly, Hannah
called her a “fucking whore” and told her that her
prior sexual history with men meant that she “deserved it”.
relayed how her perpetrator used her bisexuality against her to coerce her into
sex. If Rebecca was “not in the mood,”
Wendy would respond by saying
things like, “You’re not really queer” or “if
you’re really into girls...
then prove it”.
Some interviewees spoke of incidences where their partners made overt threats
to murder them, their children, or their victims’
subsequent intimate
partners. Everyone relayed indirect attacks that included the destruction of
property and shouting to intimidate
and cause fear. James’s abuser
destroyed “all of [his] clothes, everything that was hanging up ... had
been cut right
up the back”. Kelly’s partner “pulled a knife,
cut up all our furniture, yelled and went crazy”. When Georgia
to end her relationship with Amy, who had just completed training to be a police
officer, Amy would
rock up at the house and be yelling and banging
on the door”. Although Amy had never been physically violent, Georgia
for her life because she had access to a firearm and “could kill me
if she wanted to”. Alice reported incidents where
her abuser would slam
doors, punch walls, drive dangerously, and destroy household objects as a means
of intimidating her.
Making a victim believe a perpetrator is capable of intimate partner homicide
is an extremely effective compliance mechanism. Even
when abusers were not
making direct threats to kill, for every victim interviewed, there was often an
unspoken murderous subtext
within the intimidating and threatening actions of
their partners. For instance, Alice said, “when Jo did that, threw and
up objects, it was to show me that ‘I can also do this to
Other perpetrators destroyed non-physical assets to cause harm. Ava ran her
business from the house that she shared with her abuser,
Fiona, who deliberately
hacked and attempted to destroy Ava’s business website. More generally,
Fiona also liked to disrupt
Ava’s business activities by behaving
belligerently, throwing things, making loud noises, and arguing with Ava’s
Ava said, “she would scream at my clients for little things like
somebody dared to park on the wrong side of the driveway”.
Finally, the majority of interviewees explained that their abusers would use
threats of suicide and self-harm to cause fear and, in
turn, inculcate victim
compliance. For example, Vicky’s girlfriend demanded that she call her at
a particular time of night.
Once, when Vicky failed to comply, she awoke to the
news that her partner had attempted suicide. Rebecca’s abuser would

started to question Lisa’s behaviour, Lisa said she would “kill
herself and that her blood would be on my
hands and that just made me stop. I
was terrified that she was going to do it”. Likewise, Taylor said,
“one night, I
told her [perpetrator] that the way she was treating me
wasn’t fair and that we needed to break up. That night, she locked
in the bedroom, took a handful of pills and cut her arms at least 30 times with
a small blade”.
Humiliation, Degradation, and Emotional Cruelty
Humiliation, degradation, and emotional cruelty are tools used to establish
perpetrators’ superiority via the disintegration
of the victim’s
self-respect, worth, and esteem (Beckworth et al. 2023; Stark 2007: 258). Every
interviewee relayed having
endured these perpetrator tactics which incorporated
verbal put-downs, insulting and verbally abusing loved ones, withholding
cheating, and using homo/bi/transphobia to cause harm. As is always
the case with coercive control, perpetrators would capitalise
vulnerabilities of their victims.
Verbal put-downs were commonly used to make victim-survivors feel
“shitty”, “disgusting”, “selfish”,
“stupid”. Often, these verbal harms would be targeted at the
specific victim’s insecurities, such as concerns
or intellect. Emily told of instances where her partner, Lisa, made fun of her
physical appearance, which
would leave her feeling humiliated:
She would start telling me that whatever I was wearing made me look enormous,
and that I had ugly taste in clothing. She would try
to put me down on myself by
commenting on my weight, hair, or skin. She made me wear makeup because I was
starting to get a little
too “homely” in her eyes.
Similarly, Natalie explained that Julie used verbal put-downs to chip away at
her self-esteem by trying to convince her that there
was something wrong with
her physical appearance. Lucy’s abuser would constantly “tell me
that I was stupid. That I was
a fucking idiot”. Emily’s abuser,
Lisa, weaponised her food allergy as a tactic of degradation and humiliation.
would insist on going to seafood restaurants when Emily had a
life-threatening seafood allergy. Once there, Lisa would berate and
Emily in front of customers and waitstaff because “I couldn’t eat
Victims described enduring tirades of dehumanising and damaging verbal abuse
but equally harmful were the quiet, snide, and cruel
remarks that also
contributed to the erosion of self-esteem and worth. Georgia’s abuser
would degrade her by saying things
like, “nobody will ever like you”
and “you’re no good at this and you’re no good at that”.
Georgia used artwork and photography to express her creativity, Kate would
tell her that her work was “not very good”.
James’s abuser
would say cruel things to convince him that he was dull and unlovable, saying
things like, “you are boring”
and “you can’t
dance”. Eventually, James came to believe these things. Although 20 years
had passed since fleeing
the abuse, James said, “I don’t dance
Abusers would also verbally put down victims’ loved ones to cause harm.
For example, Georgia described a particular instance
when her abuser, Amy, began
to rant about Georgia’s teenage brother when he drove away from their home
after a visit:
My brother visited our house one time. He was new to driving at the time, so
when he was leaving, he rolled the wheels, and they made
a screeching sound. She
just started calling my brother spoiled and a fuck head, and
saying really, really nasty things about him.
Amy also liked to use transphobic slurs against Georgia’s friend,
Craig, who identified as trans. Jess’s abuser would
make comments about
the closeness of her family relationships to evoke shame and make her feel as
though they were “borderline
incestuous”. Christine described an
instance where her abuser, Jackie, verbally abused her children when they tried
Christine during an argument: she said, “‘you are
fucking cunts, go run to your mummy ... yeah, that’s what you’re
going to do’ and all that degrading stuff”.
Cruelty in actions as well as words was also a common tactic of humiliation
and degradation. For example, Jo cheated on Alice without
showering or washing
her hands afterwards, so that Alice would “smell it on her”.
Taylor’s abuser, Jenny, would
withhold affection and cheat on her. Jo
destroyed Alice’s beloved possessions—she explained:
I have loved objects that have been torn up and smashed, a nice handmade gift
from a friend broken on the ground. I’ve got all
the treasures and
trinkets, ripped-up letters from loved ones. Those things designed to hurt.
Christine’s abuser threatened to obliterate irreplaceable possessions
left for Christine by her mother after she had passed
Some victim-survivors reported that their partners used LGBTIAQ+ related
slights to justify the abuse. For example, one bisexual participant,
expressed that her lesbian partner, Wendy, was very vocal about bisexual people
being unfaithful. Consequently, Rebecca
was often the target of Wendy’s
bi-phobic rants. During these rants, Wendy would tell Rebecca that she was
“untrustworthy”,
that her bisexuality was a phase, and that Rebecca
was “not really attracted to women”.
In heterosexual instances of partner abuse, justifications for abuse based on
a victim’s sexual history are commonplace. Slurs
like “whore”
and “slut” are frequently used by abusive men to degrade their
female partners. These slurs
neutralise the perceived severity of abuse by
blaming the victim or labelling them otherwise deserving of harm. The use of
behaviours such as “slut shaming” was present for several
victim-survivors whose abusers used their previous heterosexual
relationships to
diminish their lesbian identity or to justify their enactment of abusive
jealousy. Hannah vilified Kelly for her
prior heterosexual relationship that was
a source of regret and discomfort for Kelly. Rebecca had a similar experience,
partner often bringing up her relationships with men in arguments:
She found the fact that I have slept with men before her to be really
disgusting, and she would tell me that ... she would go on these
really angry
rants about how it really disgusted her and how she was really uncomfortable
with it and all that kind of stuff.
Restricting Personal Territory and Freedom
The methods exercised under this heading are aimed at depriving
victim-survivors of social support, reducing their personal space
and freedom,
and crushing their self-identity (Jones 2000). Tactics include isolation,
financial abuse, and invasion of personal
space and privacy (Donovan and Hester
2014; Frankland and Brown 2014; Hart 1986; Hayes and Jeffries 2015; Lobel 1986;
Renzetti 1993).
Stark (2007: 262) contends that
“controllers isolate their partners to prevent disclosure, instil
dependence, express exclusive
possession, monopolize their skills and resources,
and keep them from getting help or support”.
conceptualisation expresses the importance of confinement in the absence of
bars. This sensation was experienced by
several interviewees who discussed
instances where their abusers attempted to isolate them from family, friends,
community, or other
sources of support. Natalie recounted her abuser’s
attempts at limiting her contact with family and friends. She explained:
I couldn't visit my friends and I couldn't go out on my own. She would tell
me: “you are not going out”. I wasn't allowed
to go and visit my
sister, my daughter, my friends. She was like: “you can't visit them, and
you can't talk to them either”.
Taylor’s abuser, Jenny, complained that Taylor “spent too much
time with my friends and would threaten to self-harm if
I left her alone to hang
out with them”.
Isolation was achieved by interviewees’ abusive intimate partners
through various techniques. For Natalie and Taylor, their
perpetrators were very
directive in their demands. Georgia’s and Alice’s abusers were more
covert, lying to friends and
family in a bid to isolate them. Georgia’s
girlfriend told her close friends that Georgia “didn’t even like
and “always spoke badly about [them] behind their
back”. Alice said “Jo was a liar, an absolute liar. She would
made any sort of story to make me look bad [to others]”. Some perpetrators
acted rudely or belligerently in the presence
of friends or relatives to
instigate estrangement. For example, Lucy stated that Kristy would be
discourteous toward her friends,
which resulted in “my friends hating her
so I couldn't see them unless she [Kristy] wasn't around”.
Likewise, jealousy was duplicitously used to curtail victim-survivors’
social activities, cutting them off from friends, families,
and other support
systems (Stark 2007: 249). Perpetrators would go into jealous rages if
interviewees displayed affection towards
others, such as when greeting
acquaintances or hugging friends. One perpetrator frequently lashed out whenever
a random man in public
glanced in the victim’s direction. They would rant
men, even though she was openly lesbian and not sexually interested in men at
all. Wendy refused to let Rebecca attend a bi-specific
support group because she
believed that bisexual people were unfaithful. They assumed that Rebecca would
use the pretext of attending
these gatherings as a means of cheating on her. To
placate Wendy, Rebecca stopped attending. Constantly accusing partners of
intent when they leave the house is a powerful segregation tactic.
For victim-survivors, the consequences of moving around in public
spaces are not
worth the ensuing anguish that will be meted out by the perpetrator. Thus,
victim-survivors altered their behaviours
to avoid arguments or conflict with
their partners.
Isolation is a pivotal means of control because it prevents victim-survivors
from hearing others’ perspectives and brings them
into line with the
perpetrators’ worldviews (Murphy n.d.b). As Rebecca herself said,
“Wendy was scared that if I was
involved in queer social groups ... that
they would turn me against her”. By isolating victims, perpetrators seek
to inculcate
reliance and prevent their intimate partners from disclosing the
abuse to others, seeking help and, ultimately, leaving the relationship.
Economic abuse is a common feature of intimate relationships marred by
coercive control, with the “distribution of money being
sharply skewed in
the [perpetrator’s] favour” (Stark 2007: 272). By curtailing
victims’ access to money, the perpetrator
constrains agency and restricts
freedom. For the interviewees in this study, common tactics of economic abuse
included taking or
stealing victims’ money and refusing to contribute to
household expenses. Perpetrators also prevented victim-survivors from
money on themselves. This forced them to do without to meet the
perpetrators’ demands for certain items, and the victim
incurring debt as
a result of their abusers’ actions.
Kelly’s abuser, Hannah, would “take my wallet, my phone, and my
car and leave. I had no way of getting to work, no way
of contacting anyone or
paying for anything”. Hannah would then spend Kelly’s money and
refuse to return it. At one stage
in the relationship, Kelly had not
“eaten properly in about a month. I asked for money, some of the money
that she had stolen
from me, but she refused and punched me in the pit of my
empty stomach”.
Invading victims’ personal space and privacy is another means to
restrict freedom. Several participants reported that they experienced
abuser conducting surveillance or enacting stalking behaviours during the
relationship. Others reported having their space
invaded by perpetrators who
demanded access to computers, laptops, phones, and other personal items.
Christine reported incidents
where her abuser would walk into the room and
demand access to whatever electronic device she was using. If Christine refused
surrender the device or was too slow to do so, her abuser would act
aggressively or destroy the device by smashing it in front of
Alice’s perpetrator was covert. She would access Alice’s phone,
emails, private journals, and personal correspondence
in secret, without
consent. Alice could tell when Jo had done this because Jo would try to bait
Alice by directing their conversations
toward the content of Alice’s
private messages. Alice said,
Jo would stalk my phone, break into
my social media, read my private messages using my password and then deny she
had done so”.
Jo also convinced Alice to install a program on her
smartphone that allowed her to pinpoint its physical location using GPS
Half the interviewees also experienced some degree of
post-relationship stalking and harassment. This included abusive social media
posts, phone calls, unannounced visits, nuisance behaviours, and more serious
verbal threats of harm and murder.
Several interviewees identified perpetrators utilising mind games to
manipulate, cause fear, confuse, brainwash, and entrap them.
Perpetrator tactics
included love-bombing early in the relationship, gaslighting and other lies,
threatening suicide and self-harm,
dual personalities, and the meshing of love
and abuse. Each is considered in detail below.
Many interviewees expressed that their abusers used gratuitous displays of
affection early in their relationships. For example, Taylor
described the first
six months of the relationship with Jenny as “a dream”. Taylor
said, “[Jenny] bought me presents,
took me on extravagant dates and left
love notes on my desk. People would envy how she treated me and spoiled
Natalie explained that, at this point, “the
relationship was beautiful. I felt like nothing could go wrong. I was head over
heels for this woman”. Similar feelings were experienced by Christine, who
recalled the early stages of her relationship with
her abuser, Jill:
In every way, I thought this relationship was going to be for the
rest of our lives”. Love-bombing was a shrewd foundational
coercive control because, once the overt abuse began, victim-survivors
invariably downplayed this as a “rough patch”
in their relationship,
rather than abuse. Gaslighting was also used by perpetrators to minimise,
recast, or erase their abusive behaviour.
For example, Jo would send Alice text
messages following instances of abuse and
change the [abuse]
Hannah kept Kelly in a perpetual state of confusion by twisting the reality
of everyday life.
Kelly would “do something” and Hannah
“would say, ‘oh, no, you didn’t do that’”. Kelly
on medication to treat anxiety (as a result of living with abuse). Hannah
knew this could “mess with [my] memory” and
took advantage of that.
Blaming her apparent confusion on her medication made it seem real, even when
Hannah had provoked it. Kelly
felt like her sanity was slowly eroding and she
doubted her thoughts, feelings, and actions. Likewise, Taylor explained that her
abusive partner would “often try to convince me of conversations that
never happened. Even over small irrelevant things that
didn’t matter. She
convinced me I was paranoid and losing my mind, that I was wrong about my memory
of events or conversations”.
Perpetrators of IPV often present very differently in public than they do in
private. This can create immense confusion for victim-survivors
because family
and friends may perceive the abusers as charming, loving, and attentive. Alice
articulated that publicly people would
“see [Jo] filling the glass for me,
but they wouldn’t see her smash it”. For Alice, this shift between
public kindness
and private cruelty caused cognitive dissonance. Maybe Jo was,
at heart, a kind person who sometimes did unkind things. The filling
smashing of the glass reflected a larger tactical pattern of perpetrator
behaviour that mixed acts of love and intimacy with
aggression, cruelty, or
violence. Alice poignantly described this as a “kiss delivered as a
punch”. She explained that
Jo would kind of grab and
forcefully kiss me... but it was not a kiss... not really. If you could imagine
a kiss, but a kiss delivered
as though it were a punch”.
Similarly, Christine’s second abusive partner, Jill, engaged in what
Christine aptly termed “negative affection”:
abuse disguised as
love. For example, on one occasion, while Christine was cooking over a hot
stove, Jill approached her for a hug
and “accidentally” drove
Christine’s hand onto the boiling pot, scalding her. Afterwards, when
Christine wanted
to hold hands, Jill would respond by squeezing
Christine’s knuckles together, hurting her. At other times Jill would act
though she were performing romantic gestures like running her fingers through
Christine’s hair, only to unexpectedly yank or
pull at it “and then
she would just smile”.
Summary and Final Thoughts
Since Evan Stark (2007) synthesised decades of feminist domestic violence
scholarship under the banner of coercive control, numerous
Western nations,
including Australia, have moved to criminalise the non-physical aspects of IPV.
While initially heteronormative,
Stark’s (2007) framework was later
revised to also consider the salience of coercive control for same-gender
couples (Stark
and Hester 2019: 92). However, while many of the perpetrator
tactics noted by Stark (2007) are strewn through previous studies on
lesbian IPV
(e.g., Davis and Taylor 2002; Donovan and Hester 2014; Lobel 1986; Messing et
al. 2021; Renzetti 1992; Ristock 2012)
systematic qualitative research that has
specifically explored the pertinence of Stark’s framework beyond
heterosexuality is
absent. Utilising the narratives of 18 victim-survivors, this
research fills an important gap in the existing knowledge by qualitatively
exploring the tactics used by IPV perpetrators in women’s same-gender
romantic relationships.
Our study found that perpetrators utilised a plethora of coercively
controlling strategies, including assaults, threats, intimidation,
humiliation,
degradation, emotional cruelty, mind games, and restricting victims’
territory and freedom. While these tactics
resembled those reported by
heterosexual women in prior studies, they also manifested in specific ways for
the victim-survivors in
this research. For example, some perpetrators used
homophobic rhetoric to manipulate and isolate victim-survivors. Other survivors
described their abusers exploiting myths about LGBTIAQ+ people to justify
invasive or restrictive abuse tactics. Some perpetrators
used myths about
bisexual people being unfaithful to justify going through the
victim-survivor’s personal correspondence, isolating
them from friends and
acquaintances of both sexes, or damaging items gifted to the victim-survivor by
others. In other cases, abusers
completely disregarded their relationships in
public out of a sense of internalised homophobia.
This research identifies a significant gap in the literature surrounding the
patterns and progression of coercive control. If coercive
control is understood
as a pattern of abusive behaviour and can increase in severity and frequency
over time (Stark 2007, 2009),
then it is important to examine not just the
tactics of abuse but how different tactics are combined and deployed as a
relationship
progresses. For instance, coercive and controlling abuse can be
masked, particularly early in the relationship, by coercive and controlling
tactics that mirror healthy relationships (e.g., love-bombing). The stories of
victim-survivors in this study speak to coercive control
as an ever-developing
trajectory of both violent and non-violent behaviours. This conceptualisation
better encapsulates the changing
experiences for victim-survivors and better
serves the notion that abusive relationships do not usually begin as severely
and controlling, and coercive control may present very differently
depending on the maturity of the relationship as it moves toward
dissolution.
In Australia, we will soon learn what the impacts of criminalising coercive
control will be in practice (Women’s Safety and
Justice Taskforce 2021).
Understanding the nuances of IPV beyond the heteronormative is, thus, especially
time critical. Early evaluations
of criminalisation in Scotland, England, and
Wales have paid almost no attention to the consequences for the LGBTIAQ+
community (Home
Office 2021; Scottish Government 2023). Thus, moving forward,
future research must consider the repercussions of legislative change
groups of victim-survivors, including women romantically paired with other women
(Wangmann 2022; Women’s Safety
and Justice Taskforce 2021).
