CATCHWORDS:
APPEAL AND NEW TRIAL – APPEAL – ERROR OF LAW –
INTERPRETATION – REFERENCE TO CONTEXT – where the dispute
instance was about which rating category applied to the land – where the
Member found the activities of the landowner
were determinative of use –
where the Member found the subject land is used for grazing purposes and
burdened by petroleum
leases – where the Member decided the land was to be
categorised for rating purposes as category 3/16 Rural – where the
appellant appeals that decision on the grounds that the Land Court erred in
focusing on the use of the land by the owner rather than
the use of the land as
a whole – whether the word ‘use’ included all use of the land
– whether the Member
erred in interpreting ‘use’ to be limited
to activities carried out by the landowner – whether gas extraction
out under a petroleum licence by an energy company can be considered by
the local government authority in determining ‘use’

[10] Relevantly,
the appellant’s 2017-18 Revenue Statement
“...Council has in place a differential general
rating framework, which determines rating categories based on different types
land use and different levels of service provision. The rationale for the
differing categories is to recognise:
• The levels of demand upon Council's services generated
by characteristics associated with different classes of land, and
• the levels and quality of local government facilities and services
that different categories of land and their occupiers enjoy.
In determining its
differential rating system, Council’s objective is to ensure the fair and
equitable application of lawful
rating and charging principles, without bias,
taking account of all relevant considerations. It disregards irrelevant
information
including the perceived personal wealth of individual ratepayers or
ratepayer classes.
In developing the various rating categories, it is recognised that a greater
variety of services is provided to ratepayers within
urban areas. However
services to rural ratepayers may come at an increased cost due to the lack of
scale arising from the distances
between properties.
Rural residential land is a category of land which is less than 100 hectares
and which is located in the vicinity of urban areas.
Because of these factors,
the use of this land places a higher demand on Council's urban services.
Council categorises residential and rural residential land by reference to
locality and land area.
All other lands in the region are categorised by reference to a number of
other factors, including:
• availability of
• consumption of services
• valuation.
Definitions
In this Revenue Statement and, in particular, the Categorisation and
Description Table that follows, the following definitions apply:
Intended Use
Reference to the intended use (or use intended) for rateable land is a
reference to use:
(a) that is as-of-right for the land under the relevant planning scheme
(b) for which a development approval exists
(c) for which an application for development approval has been made but not
finally determined, or
(d) when the owner of the land has informed Council of, or has started,
publicly, their intention to conduct activities upon the land.”
[11] In determining the rating category , the Member
“[87] What is important is that the rating structure
is meant to impose reasonable burdens upon landowners according to the
activities carried out on land owned by them whether that activity is carried
out by the landowner or some other party subject to
a lease or licence or some
other sort of permit to occupy.
[88] In my view, during the time when the land was owned by APLNG it would
inevitably, pursuant to the 2017-18 Revenue Statement,
have been categorised as
Petroleum Other > 400 ha. APLNG was the owner of the land, in the business of
gas extraction and responsible
for the erection of various facilities which
still remain on site, presumably consequent upon the success of some exploration
to delineate the extent of the gas resource below the ground.
[89] The extent of the drilling of wells across the subject land and other
adjoining and nearby properties is graphically shown in
an exhibit to the
affidavit of Mr Murray Geldard. (citations omitted)
[90] I am satisfied that once ownership passed to Mr Geldard then the
principal activity carried out on the site ceased to be that
of gas extraction
and became almost exclusively rural save for the presence of the wells and pads
which remained on the land together
with underground pipe lines and access
[91] Counsel for the appellant characterises the current situation in the
following terms:
“The gas activities undertaken by Origin (as agent of APLNG...) on the
subject land are not undertaken by the Appellant, or
by Roxburgh, all with their
permission, but rather by Origin under statutory fiat.” (citations
[92] The receipt by Mr Geldard of money paid pursuant to the Conduct and
Compensation Agreement is not revenue earned from gas extraction
but is, as I
observed above, compensation for the interference with his rights as freehold
owner by the gas company and its remnant
activity on land which Mr Geldard now
owns as freehold land.”
The appellant’s submissions
[12] The ten grounds of appeal need not be set out in detail. In essence, the
appellant contends that the Land Court was in error
in focusing on what the
owner, the rate-payer, was using the land for, rather than what the land was
being used for, something not
restricted to uses conducted only by or on behalf
of the owner.
[13] The appellant accepts that rating category 3/16 Rural was contended for by
the respondent as it reflected his use of the land
for grazing and
agriculture.
However, the land had
to be categorised by reference to its use by all persons, not just its use by
[14] The appellant submits that, in considering that issue, it was not necessary
for the land to be principally or predominantly
used for gas extraction. The
Petroleum Other category could be satisfied if the land was used “in whole
or in part” and
whether “predominantly or not,” for those
[15] The appellant submits that as the land was freehold and over 400ha, it
fell for rating purposes under “Land other than
a Petroleum Lease,”
within the meaning of category 4/31 Petroleum Other (>400
Once the land is found to
be within that category, it could not be within category 3/16 Rural, as that
category only applies to land
not otherwise categorised.
[16] The appellant also submits that the Land Court erred in its consideration
of the applicability of the concept of a petroleum
lease in the facts of this
case; in misconstruing the meaning of the Rural category; and in incorrectly
having regard to evidence
land, something the Court found “not to be determinative” but
to the appeal before
respondent’s submissions
[17] The respondent submits that the appellant’s interpretation results in
capricious and unintended rating outcomes. Under
that interpretation, an
easement for a gas pipeline on the edge of a large grazing property would result
in the whole property attracting
a rating of category 4/31 Petroleum Other
[18] The respondent contends that the correct construction of the Revenue
Statement required the respondent’s land and the
petroleum leases to be
rated separately. The land, being used solely for grazing and some cropping, was
properly categorised as category
3/16 Rural.
[19] The respondent submits that the rating categories should not be construed
to apply to uses other than those permitted by the
and thus enjoyed by,
and not simply, as here, imposed on
The definition of
“intended use” in the Revenue Statement supports such a
construction. Significantly, the Revenue Statement
does not contain a definition
of “use” or “used.”
[20] The respondent submits that, because gas extraction by a gas company is
undertaken under statutory authority and not under an
agreement with the
landowner, it is not undertaken by or on behalf of the landowner. The
respondent, as owner of the land, had no
control over the gas infrastructure or
gas extraction and, although he might have received compensation mandated by
statute, he did
not receive royalties for the gas extraction.
[21] The Revenue Statement, as shown in category 4/10 Petroleum Lease –
Gas <1000 HA and category 4/34 Underground Coal
Gasification - <1000 HA,
provides for situations where the gas company as leaseholder is the ratepayer.
Where, as here, the owner
of the land is not in any real sense a participant in
the activity referred to in category 4/31 Petroleum Other (>400 HA), that
category cannot apply. Any ambiguity in category 4/31 Petroleum Other (>400
HA) ought to be resolved in the respondent’s
[22] The Revenue Statement recognised the level and quality of facilities and
services that different categories of land and their
occupiers enjoy and the
objectives of fairness and
The respondent does not
enjoy greater levels and quality of facilities and services from the appellant
as a result of its categorisation.
[23] The respondent submits that the appellant’s inconsistent rating of
adjoining land illustrated the respondent’s construction
of the Revenue
Statement but rating of that adjoining land did not feature directly in the
reasoning of the Land Court Member.
Consideration
[24] It is not in dispute that the appellant may properly levy differentiated
general rates and may decide the rating categories
and their descriptions.
[25] There is also no dispute that the appellant had decided, by resolution, the
rating categories of rateable lands giving a description
of each category as
required under section 81 of the
Local Government Regulations 2012
[26] The function of the Land Court, in exercising its powers on the
respondent’s appeal against the appellant’s categorisation
relevant land, was to decide the correct rating category for the
[27] In doing so, the Land Court was to give a practical, sensible, broad and
fair reading to the appellant’s revenue statement
and ratings categories
in the context of the application of orthodox principles of statutory
interpretation.
[28] A determination of the rating category required consideration of the words
adopted by the appellant. As Dalton J observed in
Moreton Bay Regional
Council v White
“... the rating categories were not
formulated on the spur of the moment, bearing a relationship to debate in
Council. They
were a considered technical document introduced as a resolution
to a special general meeting of the Council. For that reason, I
think the Court
is right to look at the words the Council chose to use.”
[29] Rates are a tax on land, not on the owner. Rating categories are framed
around usage of the land. As the appellant’s
revenue statement observed,
rating categories are determined “based on different types of land use and
different levels of
service production”. The relevant “use”
is derived from some characteristic of the
[30] The Member found that categorisation of the subject land required him
“to contemplate, given the rates are to be paid
by the landowner, which is
the “principal” activity carried on by that registered
[31] Further, the Member found that once ownership passed to the respondent, the
“principal activity” carried out on
the land ceased to be that of
gas extraction and became almost exclusively rural save for the presence of gas
infrastructure which
remained on the
[32] Such an approach was an error and inconsistent with a proper determination
of the appropriate rating category for that land.
It is use of the land, not
solely the principal activity of the owner of the land, that determines
categorisation.
[33] An important feature of rating category 4/31 Petroleum Other (>400 HA)
is that it did not require the land to be used exclusively,
predominantly for gas extraction and associated activities. Such wording was a
deliberate departure from the wording of
previous rate resolutions adopted by
the appellant, which had employed the “primary” use
[34] The wording of the rating categories adopted by the appellant evidences an
intention to give consideration to all uses of the
land, not merely its
predominant use. Such an approach rendered the authorities relied upon by the
Member below distinguishable.
The Member’s failure to determine the appeal having regard to such a
changed approach was an error.
[35] The appellant determined that petroleum leases were a separate and distinct
form of tenure, captured by other rating categories.
This distinct and
deliberate decision is consistent with an intention by the appellant that the
owners of freehold land used for
a variety of uses, including in part the
extraction of gas and associated activities, be liable for the payment of rates
on a particular
basis, having regard to that use of the land.
[36] Such a requirement is neither unfair nor unreasonable. It involves an
appropriate exercise of a local government’s power
to levy differential
general rates on land within its local government area having regard to its use.
[37] The construction adopted by the Member to the rating categories failed to
give proper effect to the words “Land, other
than a Petroleum Lease”
when considering the appropriate categorisation of the respondent’s land.
The land in question
was freehold land. The fact that the land was within the
area of petroleum leases granted pursuant to the
Petroleum and Gas
(Production) Safety Act
(Qld) did not alter that.
[38] The Member’s erroneous construction of the rating categories led to a
further error. Contrary to the Member’s observations,
the Rural Rating
category of “Land used principally for rural purposes, which is not
otherwise categorised” is not consistent
with commencing with a
“blank sheet of
The appropriate
categorisation of the subject land required consideration of the various rating
categories. The land could not fall
within category 3/16 Rural if it is
otherwise categorised.
[39] Such a construction did not involve any preconception that the existing
categorisation is an appropriate one. It involved giving
proper effect to the
intended meaning of the words used by the appellant in its rating
categorisations, in the context of the structure
and context of the Revenue
Statement as a whole.
[40] The errors identified above are sufficient to determine that the appeal
must be allowed. It is accordingly unnecessary to determine
the remaining
ground of appeal, namely, that the Member erred in having regard to evidence
by the respondent.
[41] Had it been necessary to do so, a consideration of the Member’s
reasons supported a conclusion that, even if the Council’s
categorisation
of neighbouring land in the rural category was irrelevant, the Member’s
reference to it did not affect the decision.
The Member expressly acknowledged
that the categorisation of that land was not determinative of the outcome of the
[42] Error having been established, this Court is to give the judgment which
ought to have been given at first
[43] Having regard to the ratings categories adopted by the appellant, and the
contents of the appellant’s Revenue Statement,
the proper categorisation
of the respondent’s land requires that due consideration be given to the
fact that the appellant,
in the proper exercise of its power to levy
differential rates on different categories of land, determined that freehold
land, other
than a petroleum lease, which was used or intended to be used for
gas extraction and associated activities was subject to a particular
[44] In devising that structure, the appellant specifically pursued a
categorisation which was not based on the primary or predominant
use of land.
Freehold land holdings above a certain size, which had a use or intended use of
gas extraction or associated activities,
although not its whole or predominant
use, are subject to that specific categorisation.
[45] The respondent’s land falls within category 4/31 Petroleum Other
(>400 HA). It is land, other than a petroleum lease;
it is above the
requisite size; and it was used in part for gas extraction and associated
activities.
[46] Such land, being the subject of another categorisation, does not fall
within category 3/16 Rural even though another use of
the property is grazing
and associated activities.
[47] This conclusion is not altered by the fact that the Revenue Statement does
not define use but does define “intended to
be used”. A definition
of intended to be used is understandable, in the context of ratings categories.
It limits proposed intended
uses to objectively established future uses by
defined factors.
[48] There is no need to limit the present use of land. That is easily
discernible. “Use” is a well understood word.
It is to be given its
ordinary meaning.
[49] The fact that “intended to be used” is defined in a particular
way does not limit or restrict the ordinary meaning
of the word
“use”. To do otherwise would not involve the broad, sensible and
practical reading of the ratings categories
[50] The Court orders:
appeal is allowed.
orders of the Land Court are set aside.
appeal to the Land Court is dismissed.
The Court will
hear the parties as to costs.
