Introduction
is an application by the Chief Executive for Disciplinary proceedings against
the respondent, Kerry Anne Clout, pursuant to
s.496(1)(b)(i)
496(1)(g)(iii)
Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act
“Act”). The application is brought under
section 497
of the Act.
The “charges” against the respondent are set out in an amended
application filed on 9 June 2009, namely
that the respondent has contravened or
breached the Act, including a code of conduct and the respondent has, in
carrying on a business
or performing an activity, been incompetent or acted in
an unprofessional way.
Ware appeared for the applicant. There was no appearance for the respondent.
At the hearing of the application on 9 July 2009,
I first determined whether I
was satisfied that the respondent had either been given notice of the hearing or
could not be located
after the making of reasonable inquiries into her
whereabouts. Subject to the subsequent filing of affidavits confirming what I
had been told about the efforts made to find the current whereabouts of the
respondent, I was satisfied that she could not be located
after the making of
reasonably inquiries into her whereabouts and that I could therefore hear and
determine the matter in her absence,
in accordance with
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act
. The applicant subsequently
filed affidavits of Janice Godsall and Luke Coles deposing to the relevant
Factual Background
respondent was the responsible person for, and the person in daily control of,
the motor dealing activities conducted by Carwholesalers.com.au
Pty Ltd. She
was one of two directors of that company and secretary of the company. She was
the principal licensee of the company,
which itself held a motor dealer’s
licence under the Act.
events that the applicant relies upon comprise three separate transactions.
First, on 12 August 2006, John Brennan purchased
a motor vehicle from the
company for a price which included stamp duty, and registration transfer fees.
The company was to arrange
for payment of the fees and duty. The company failed
to do so and Mr Brennan suffered a loss of $222.00 as a result of his dealings.
He has been reimbursed by the Claim Fund for that loss.
on 15 September 2006, Sandra Miosge and Francis Betridge purchased a motor
vehicle from the company for a price which included
stamp duty and registration
transfer fees totalling $304.95. Again, the company did not, as it had agreed
to do, pay the transfer
fee and stamp duty. The purchasers suffered a loss
totalling $355.15 as a result of that transaction, for which they have been
by the Claim Fund.
on 26 November 2006, Melanie Naudier and Sebastian Lemeur purchased a motor
vehicle from the company for a price which included
the registration transfer
fee, stamp duty, six months’ registration and an extended warranty, none
of which was paid for or
provided by the company, causing a loss of over
$1,000.00 to the purchasers. Again, they have been reimbursed by the Claim
company was deregistered on 24 August 2008, pursuant to section 601AB of the
Corporations Act
. Its registration as a motor dealer had expired on 23
June 2007, having been allowed to lapse. It seems that the company had actually
gone out of business sometime before then, apparently in late 2006.
I have said, the respondent did not appear on the hearing of the application and
therefore I have heard no explanation for her
failure to cause her company to
pay the transfer and registration fees and stamp duty in respect of these
transactions. It appears
likely, however, that her company was in some
financial trouble during the relevant period.
regard to these matters and the evidence filed on behalf of the Chief Executive,
I am satisfied that the respondent has contravened
or breached clause 7(1) of
Property Agents and Motor Dealers (Motor Dealing Practice Code of
Conduct) Regulation
2001, in that she has not acted honestly, fairly and
professionally in the conduct of a motor dealing practice. I am also satisfied
that, as a licensee, she has, in carrying on the business of a motor dealer,
acted in an unprofessional way by failing to cause her
company to pay the
amounts it had received from the respective customers for registration and
transfer fees and stamp duty.
Appropriate Orders and
orders sought by the Chief Executive were that:
respondent be reprimanded;
respondent pay a fine to be determined by the Tribunal;
respondent be disqualified from holding any form of licence or certificate of
registration under the Act;
respondent be prohibited from being an executive officer of a corporation that
holds any form of licence issued under the Act;
respondent pay the Chief Executive’s costs of and incidental to this
proceeding.
her written and oral submissions, Ms Ware submitted that the appropriate orders
were that the respondent be reprimanded, be ordered
to pay a penalty of $500.00
and be disqualified from holding any form of licence or certificate of
registration under the Act for
a period of three years. She referred me to only
one comparable decision of the Tribunal, namely
The Chief Executive v
(PD006-08), in which the respondent was reprimanded, disqualified
from holding a motor dealer’s licence or certificate of registration
motor dealing sales person for a period of two years, and ordered to pay a fine
in the sum of $750.00. In that matter the respondent
had sold a motor vehicle
and had issued only a sales receipt and a dealer’s receipt to the
customer, rather than the other
documents that were required to be provided,
such as a contract of sale and the relevant statutory notices. The motor
vehicle was
defective and the respondent failed to attend to the repairing of
the defects under the statutory warranty, putting the customer
to expense of
over $1,000.00. The Chairperson did not give reasons for her orders in that
case, so I cannot ascertain whether there
were grounds for mitigation of the
appropriate penalty.
Ware submitted that, in this case, the respondent’s conduct was over a
short period, but it appears to have been flagrantly
dishonest. She submitted
also that the respondent has not appeared, has given no expression of remorse
and so there should be no
reduction in penalty.
am not satisfied that the respondent’s conduct was flagrantly dishonest.
As I have said, it appears likely that, at the time,
her business was failing.
In the absence of evidence from her explaining the circumstances in which the
conduct occurred, I cannot
be satisfied that it occurred other than negligently
or because of the poor financial position of her company. Nevertheless it is
serious misconduct. There are no mitigating factors to be taken into
proceeding such as this is disciplinary rather than punitive. The
Tribunal’s function is protective, rather than punitive,
and is to frame
orders sufficient to deter any repetition of the offending conduct, to indicate
to other licensees that the conduct
is unacceptable and to maintain public
confidence in the regulatory regime established by the
is not a matter in which I am satisfied of active dishonesty. Nor is it a
matter involving misuse of trust funds. Nor has the
respondent’s conduct
been shown to have caused substantial loss to two of the three customers, the
subject of the complaints.
other matters in which the respondent’s conduct has been found to be
fraudulent, penalties of $1,000.00 to $3,000.00 have
, which did not apparently involve fraud, the respondent was
ordered to pay a fine of $750.00.
my view, the appropriate orders to be made in this case are that the
respondent:-
ordered to pay a fine of $750.00 by 4:00pm on 30 September 2009.
disqualified from holding any licence or certificate of registration under the
Act for a period of two (2) years.
disqualified from being an executive officer of a corporation holding a licence
or certificate of registration under the Act for
a period of two (2)
to The Chief Executive legal costs fixed in the sum of $1,520.00 by 4:00pm on 30
September 2009..
shall make orders accordingly.
