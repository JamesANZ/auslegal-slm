Legislation and case law
Separated parents with shared care or two children: equal care; assessment
of greater need
CLARKE and SECRETARY to the DSS and
Decided: 27th September 2013 by S Webb
Clarke and Harrington were the parents of G, born 2004 and B, born 2008. The
couple separated in 2008. There was a history of conflict
and the Family Court
Orders, made by consent on 29 April 2008, allocated approximately equal shared
care of the children on a week
arrangement, the orders were substantially adhered to and were made to give a
of stability for the children. Clarke and Harrington were paid parenting
payment single (PPS) on the basis of no shared care: Clarke
was paid as 100 per
cent carer of B and Harrington was paid as 100 per cent carer of G.
Neither party worked, each party lived in rental accommodation and expenses
for each child were similar except that B had a speech
difficulty and Harrington
placed him in child care for 2 days each week, when in his care, in order to
access skilled help for the
difficulty. Clarke was aware of the placement and
did not object. The cost of the care was $170 every second week and Harrington
applied for the child care rebate to assist with this expense.
Harrington filled out the claim form for parenting payment setting out care
arrangements, which Clarke also signed. The form indicated
a change in care
arrangements: namely that Clarke had 51% care of B and Harrington had 51% care
of G. Clarke claimed she did not
understand the form and signed the parts
indicated by Harrington because she was scared of Harrington. Centrelink made
the decision
that Harrington was the principal carer of each child from 22 March
2011, and C’s PPS was cancelled. The SSAT affirmed the
cancellation.
The AAT was required to determine which of the parents was the principle
carer of the children, or if the circumstances justified
a different principal
carer determination for each carer.
Legislation and case law
Social Security Act 1991
(the Act), a person is
eligible for parenting payment if the person has at least one ‘PP
Section 500D
, in force at the relevant time, sets out the criteria
for determining whether a child is a ‘PP child’ of a person. Under
and (19) a child can have only one principal carer at any time:
Principal carer—a child can only have one principal carer
5(18) Only one person at a time can be the principal carer of a particular
5(19) If the Secretary is satisfied that, but for subsection (18), 2 or more
persons (adults) would be principal carers of the same
child, the Secretary
(a) make a written determination specifying one of the adults as the
principal carer of the child; and
(b) give a copy of the determination to each adult.
In a case involving more than one child of separated parents, it is necessary
to make a principal carer determination in respect of
each child. The Act does
not offer guidance as to how such a determination should be made, the only
guidance as to government policy
is set out in the Principal Carer –
Shared Care section of the Guide to Social Security Law (the Guide). The
guidelines are
not binding but it is appropriate to apply them unless there is a
compelling reason not to do so.
In Smedley and Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace
Relations & Beveridge
[2010] AATA 292
it was observed that it was a difficult burden to determine which of two
parents, equally sharing the care of a child and each otherwise
qualifying for
parenting payment, has the greatest ‘need of a favourable
determination’ as principal carer of the child
for the purpose of
obtaining parenting payment to the exclusion of the other. The AAT stated that
although the assessment of parental
‘need’ is directed to placing
the child in the best position in respect of quality of care, it also requires
an assessment
of the ability of each parent to cope with the costs of caring for
the child. All the circumstances of care of a child, in respect
child’s day-to-day care, welfare and development, must be considered.
The AAT in Smedley found that these were the steps to assist the
determination:
(a) is the care of the child shared by two or more people; and if so
(b) is the child a dependent of each person and in that person’s care;
(c) are both carers claiming or receiving income support; and if so
(d) are both carers providing equal care; and if so
(e) which person is most in need of a favourable determination?
If there is more than one child, these questions must be answered for each
child and two further questions then arise -
(f) are the circumstances of care of each child the same; and if not
(g) do the circumstances justify a different principal carer determination
for each carer?
In this case the AAT found that the care of the dependent children was shared
The difference in care percentages for each child was 2 percent. From 22
March 2011 Clarke had 51 percent care of B and 49 percent
care of G, and
Harrington had 49 percent care of B and 51 percent care of G. The guidelines
indicate a variation in care percentages
of less than 10 percent, is to be taken
as equal care.
The Tribunal referred to the factors in the Guide to determine who was in
most need of parenting payment single.
The Guide refers to factors that must be considered, and other factors that
may be considered.
For the factors that must be considered:
Whether one carer already qualifies as principal carer of another
Clarke and Harrington were already qualified as principal carer of another
Whether only one carer would be eligible for PP.
From 22 March 2011 both Clarke and Harrington would be eligible for PP.
Clarke alleged that Harrington was partnered from December
2010, Centrelink
determined Harrington was partnered from 29 October 2012.
Which carer would receive the higher rate of payment?
On the evidence each would have received a similar rate of payment.
Any other sources of income the carer may have.
Clarke asserted that from March 2011 Harrington was sometimes employed in a
family business, and that he conducted a cleaning business.
Harrington explained
that he did attend the business of a relative from time to time but that he was
not employed by the business.
The AAT found that there were questions about the
reliability of the evidence of both Clarke and Harrington and, in the absence of
corroboration, the AAT found there was no evidence to show either party had
income from any other source from March 2011.
The asset levels of each carer.
Clarke and Harrington each owned a motor vehicle but there were no other
assets of significance.
For the factors that may be considered:
The expenses for each carer.
The AAT examined the rent payments for each party and gave weight to the
child care expense for B.
The workforce experience, education levels and future employment prospects
of each carer.
Clarke had more recent experience in the workforce, and was certified to
legally serve alcohol. Harrington had left school earlier
than C, but had
practical skills relating to working on cars.
The duration that each carer has been on income support and their
principal carer status during this time.
Up to 21 March 2011 Clarke and Harrington were each receiving payment as
principal carer, and for an extended period.
Any other relevant factors.
The AAT considered the history of domestic conflict and also considered the
extra family support available to Harrington and the fact
that C’s family
support was more remote.
Principal carer assessment
The AAT found little to differentiate between the needs of each parent. The
cost of child care was seen as a difference adding to
the expenses of
Harrington. When Harrington became partnered, the emotional needs of Clarke were
determined to be less met than those
of Harrington. The AAT found that the needs
of each were finely balanced and that the guidelines favour a decision to
maintain the
status quo.
Are the circumstances of care of each child the same?
The AAT found that the care arrangements for B and G were not the same
because of the development issues of B necessitating the child
care placement.
The AAT found that in those circumstances there was justification for a
principal carer determination for each carer.
The AAT set aside the SSAT decision and decided that:
• from 22 March 2011 to 15 October 2012, Harrington was the principal
carer of B;
• from 16 October 2012, Clarke was principal carer of B; and
• from 22 March 2011, Clarke was principal carer of G.
The matter was remitted to the Secretary to determine the amount of parenting
payment that was payable to Clarke and Harrington in
accordance with these
