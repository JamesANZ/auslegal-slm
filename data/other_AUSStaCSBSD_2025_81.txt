Committee comment
Telecommunications
Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards) Bill
This bill seeks to amend the
Telecommunications Act 1997
establish a carriage service provider registration scheme; make industry codes
directly enforceable by the Australian Communications
and Media Authority; and
amend existing arrangements relating to the application of penalty amounts for
infringement notices and
civil penalties.

Section 121
Telecommunications Act 1997
provides that the
ACMA may direct a participant in a particular section of the telecommunications,
telemarketing or fax marketing
industry to comply with an industry code, if the
ACMA is satisfied the person is or has contravened the code. A person must
with the ACMA’s direction and if they do not, they will be subject
to a civil penalty (of an amount determined by the Federal
Court to be
appropriate).
2.88 The bill seeks to replace this section to provide that if an industry
code is registered, each participant in the industry must
comply with it, and if
it is not complied with, they will be subject to a civil
This therefore removes
the requirement for the ACMA to first issue a direction, making the penalty
applicable as soon as the ACMA
is satisfied the person has failed to comply with
the code. This provision (currently and as amended) would also make it a civil
penalty to aid, induce, be a party to, or conspire with others to effect, a
contravention.

Scrutiny Digest 5 of 2025
the committee requested the
minister’s advice as to:
• whether any individuals are likely to be detrimentally affected by
the retrospective application of proposed
section 121
• why it is considered necessary and appropriate for the amendment to
be applied retrospectively.
Minister for Communications and Minister for Sport
2.91 As to whether any individuals are likely to be detrimentally affected by
retrospective application, the minister advised that:
• I note similar prohibitions already exist in the
Telecommunications Act 1997
in relation to breaches of directions to
comply with industry codes
(subsection 121(3))
and breaches of industry
(subsection 128(2)).
The Department... has not been able to identify any action taken by the
Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) against
any individuals for
breaches of those existing prohibitions. Therefore, it is unlikely any
individual will be subject to retrospective
action as a result of the Bill and
subsection 121(2).
The amendments in Schedule 2 of the Bill allow the ACMA to take immediate
action for breaches of industry codes, to address consumer
harm and hold
telecommunications providers to account... However, it does not dictate what
action the ACMA must take, or that the
ACMA must apply a civil penalty.
2.92 The minister also advised there are a range of actions the ACMA may take
in relation to breaches, with court-imposed penalties
generally being used as a
measure of last resort, after other enforcement actions have been pursued.
2.93 In relation to why it is considered necessary and appropriate for the
amendment to apply retrospectively, the minister noted
that such application
would align the enforcement of registered industry codes with the enforcement
approach that is used for industry
standards. Further, the minister advised that
were retrospective enforcement not available, the direction power would be
with any later breaches being managed under the framework proposed in
Committee comment
2.94 The committee thanks the minister for this response.
2.95 The committee acknowledges the minister’s advice that, having
regard to the lack of any identified action taken by the
ACMA against
individuals for breaches of existing industry codes under the
Telecommunications Act 1997
, it is not considered likely that individuals
will be subject to retrospective action as a result of proposed
section 121
2.96 The committee also notes the minister’s advice that retrospective
application of proposed
subsection 121(2)
is required to align the enforcement
of registered industry codes with the approach applied to the enforcement of
industry standards.
Further, the committee understands it is a matter of concern
that, if retained, the directions power in existing
section 121
would become
increasingly redundant as time passes were the provision not capable of applying
retrospectively.
2.97 The committee reiterates that retrospective application challenges a
basic principle of the rule of law that laws should only
operate prospectively.
The committee therefore has long-standing scrutiny concerns in relation to
provisions which have the effect
of applying retrospectively. The
committee’s concerns with respect to retrospectivity will be heightened
where the legislation
would, or might, have a detrimental effect on an
individual, including where a person may be exposed to the retrospective
of a civil penalty in circumstances where they would previously have
been subject to a direction.
2.98 In such circumstances—where an individual’s interests will,
or may be, affected by the retrospective application
of proposed legislation,
the committee expects that the exceptional circumstances justifying the use of
retrospectivity should be
clearly identified, preferably in the explanatory
memorandum.
2.99 It is possible that an individual could be subject to the retrospective
application of civil penalties for having aided, abetted
or conspired with
others to breach a registered industry code, the committee does not consider
that achieving consistency with the
enforcement regime for industry codes are
sufficiently exceptional circumstances such as would justify the possible
application of
civil penalties against an individual.
2.100 The committee draws its scrutiny concerns to the attention of
senators and leaves to the Senate as a whole the appropriateness
