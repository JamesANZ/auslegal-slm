can no longer be acted upon to the extent that this appointment has
(a) The Enduring Power of Attorney dated 8 March 2002 appointing HN and HC as
attorneys for financial, personal and health matters.
REASONS FOR DECISION
HISTORY OF THE APPLICATION
[1] HIO is 87 years old and resides in her own home.
[2] HIO has four children; HN, HC, VB and another daughter from whom she is
[3] HC and HN act as attorneys for HIO under an Enduring Power of Attorney
granted on 8 March 2002.
[4] HIO was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s type dementia in November 2001 and
her attorneys have progressively taken over decision
making since their
appointment in accordance with the least restrictive option, in particular they
now manage her financial affairs
and make decisions for her in regard to health
care and service provision.
[5] In March 2006 HIO was diagnosed with diabetes and the attorneys’ level
of day-to-day involvement has increased to ensure
that HIO diet is appropriate
and that she is taking her medication.
[6] VB and her husband GB, have had various concerns about the decision making
of the attorneys in particular in regard to HIO continuing
to reside at her home
and whether appropriate measures are in place in respect of her nutrition and
comfort and whether their management
of her finances was in her best
[7] VB made an application to the Tribunal on 1 May 2002, which resulted in a
referral by the Tribunal to the Adult Guardian for
investigation of allegations
in regard to financial mismanagement. The Adult Guardian’s report dated 28
March 2003 found that
there were no grounds to support the allegations and the
Tribunal application did not proceed.
[8] The current application was made on 7 June 2006, by GB and it raised similar
issues in regard to the attorney’s financial
management and also that HIO
was at risk living alone due to her inadequate diet, isolation and her lack of
ability to regulate her
environment. That is she kept the house locked up and
was unable to cool it in summer or heat it in winter even though there was
conditioning and heating available in the house.
Issues and the Legislation
[9] The issues for the Tribunal are:
(a) Does HIO currently
have capacity?
(b) Is there a need for a Guardian? If so, who should be
(c) Is there a need for an Administrator? If so, who should be
appointed; and
[10] The Tribunal is required to determine capacity as at the date of hearing in
accordance with
Guardianship and Administration Act
(the Act) as the Tribunal must be satisfied that HIO has impaired
capacity before it can further consider the applications for the
appointment of
a guardian and administrator for HIO.
[11] HIO is presumed to have capacity in accordance with
Guardianship and Administration Act
and General Principle 1 under
Schedule 1 of the
Guardianship and Administration Act
Tribunal will consider the medical evidence and submissions from the parties to
determine if the presumption of capacity
has been rebutted for
Guardianship and Administration Act
defines capacity as
, for a person for a matter, means the
person is capable of—
(a) understanding the nature and effect of decisions about the matter;
(b) freely and voluntarily making decisions about the matter; and
(c) communicating the decisions in some way.
[13] The Tribunal when considering the appointment of a guardian or
administrator must be satisfied not only in regard to capacity
but also of the
other matters set out in
Guardianship and Administration
as follows:
12 Appointment
The tribunal may, by order, appoint a guardian for a
personal matter, or an administrator for a financial matter, for an adult if
tribunal is satisfied—
(a) the adult has impaired capacity for the matter; and
(b) there is a need for a decision in relation to the matter or the adult
is likely to do something in relation to the matter that
involves, or is likely
to involve, unreasonable risk to the adult’s health, welfare or property;
(c) without an appointment—
(i) the adult’s needs will not be adequately met; or
(ii) the adult’s interests will not be adequately protected.
The appointment may be on terms considered appropriate
by the tribunal.
The tribunal may make the order on its own initiative or
on the application of the adult, the adult guardian or an interested
[14] The fact that there may be an attorney appointed under an Enduring Power of
Attorney is especially relevant in determining whether
an adult’s needs
will not be met without an appointment. The Tribunal must consider whether the
appointed attorneys should
continue in that role or whether their appointment
should be revoked under
section 116
Powers of Attorney Act 1998
be made subject to the appointment of a guardian or administrator under
Guardianship and Administration Act
[15] In making that determination, the Tribunal will consider the conduct of HC
and HN as attorneys for HIO and whether they have
exercised power in accordance
Powers of Attorney Act 1998
[16] If the Tribunal determines that that there is a need for the appointment of
a guardian and/or administrator for HIO, the Tribunal
in deciding whom to
appoint in those roles will have regard to the appropriateness consideration set

THE PARTIES
[17] The active parties attending the hearing were HIO, GB, VB, HC, HN and a
representative of the Adult Guardian. The following
interested parties were also
present at the hearing; daughter-in-law, HS and HG with NW attending by
The Evidence
[18] In addition to the written material contained on the Tribunal file, all of
the parties attending the hearing were given the
opportunity to express their
views. These views where specifically relied upon by the Tribunal, are discussed
in the body of this
DOES HIO LACK
[19] HIO was first diagnosed with dementia as a result of Alzheimer’s
disease in 2001. She has particular difficulty with her
short-term memory and
this was evident at the hearing in terms of her ability to follow the
proceedings. Her family all agreed that
at present she was not able to make her
own decisions as a result of dementia.
[20] HIO’s treating doctor, Dr Andrews, provided a health professional
report dated 6 December 2005 in respect of HIO’s
decision-making capacity.
He noted that he had last seen HIO on 19 April 2005 and that he had known her
since February 2001.
[21] In his report he stated that HIO had a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s
dementia, which commenced in November 2001. He stated
Interfamily
conflict between the xxx and xxx regarding the standard of care provided by the
xxx was a factor which impacted on HIO’s
ability to make
[22] Dr Andrews reported that HIO had the following MMSE
MMSE 17/30 on 3 May 2002
MMSE 17/30 on 15 April
[23] Dr Andrews gave the following opinion in regard to HIO’s ability to
understand the nature and effect of decisions:
In regard to Personal Health care – “
Is able to understand
information provided but is unable to act on this or appreciate
consequences.”
Lifestyle and Accommodation Choices – “
as above, is dependant
regarding looking after her accommodation needs.”
Financial affairs – “
As above, I do not feel HIO has capacity to
manage her own financial affairs.”
[24] Dr Andrews did not consider that HIO would be able to make decisions freely
and voluntarily and stated that “as she spends
most time with HS and HC,
and they are responsible for her ongoing care, I would expect her to be most
influenced by them.”
[25] He stated that she did not have an impairment in regard to her ability to
communicate.
[26] Dr Andrews’s opinion was that HIO would not be able to make any
complex decisions and that there was a gradual loss of
cognitive skills since
2001, with an ongoing deterioration evidenced by a fall in her MMSE over
[27] Having regard to HIO diagnosis of Alzheimer’s dementia, the Tribunal
is satisfied that she has impaired capacity for both
personal and financial
IS THERE A NEED FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A GUARDIAN AND IF SO WHO SHOULD BE
[28] In his application, GB stated the attorneys were blocking contact and that
HIO’s nutrition was not adequate. He also stated
that HIO’s doctor
had prescribed Respiridol as a result of complaints by the attorneys that she
was aggressive. He said that
this was not the case. He further stated that HIO
had been diagnosed with level 2 diabetes in 2006, which he ascribed to her diet
of bread and jam and too much sleep. He stated that, according to HIO’s
doctor, Dr Andrews, her condition needed to be managed
daily and she should be
eating small amounts every couple of hours during the day and the oversleep
problem should be rectified as
too much sleep is detrimental to her health. He
further stated that this could not be achieved while HIO lives alone as her
aren’t available hourly. In the outcomes he was seeking, he said
that HIO should reside at his and VB’s farm for proper
care and to stop
the isolation (sic) and that the attorneys should be
[29] GB elaborated on these matters during the hearing and in particular the
issue about the house being shut up and the air-conditioning
never being turned
on when they visited, the lack of food and the dirtiness of the house. In regard
to house cleaning, he advised
that he and VB had arranged for RSL Care to
provide fortnightly cleaning services for HIO.
[30] VB provided the Tribunal with a copy of the diary she kept of her phone
calls and meetings with HIO for the period from 7/1/05
to 3/6/06. The diary
entries displayed the concerns that VB had in regard to HIO not eating properly
and there being little food
in the house; her being in a closed house without
adequate cooling during summer and heating in winter, though air-conditioning
available; her being bored and lonely; her personal hygiene, in particular
her hair not being attended to; and the house not being
regularly cleaned though
later it is noted that home help was in place to provide cleaning services. On a
positive note, the diary
records HIO enjoyment of her outings with the
Alzheimer’s Association; these outings having been instigated by the
to alleviate HIO’s boredom and isolation. The diary also showed
that HIO received regular visits from HN and HC and their families
and that her
meals, medication and health care were being attended to by the attorneys. It
was made clear though that VB felt that
her contact with her mother was being
frustrated to a certain degree by the attorneys and that they were not
consulting her about
HIO’s health issues. She was however certainly
informed by the attorneys, when HIO was diagnosed with
[31] VB also raised an issue in regard to the prescription of the drug
Respiridol for her mother. Dr Andrews had prescribed this
tablet as a result of
concerns raised by HC and HN that HIO was becoming aggressive. VB removed this
drug as she was concerned that
it was, in her own words, “
.” The attorneys re-instated the Respiridol and at a later time
Dr Andrews recommended that the drug be stopped for a trial
period. As at the
time of the hearing the drug had been re-instated.
[32] The Tribunal was provided with written material from GB and VB confirming
that they had contacted HIO’s doctor, various
government agencies and a
legal service in their attempts to ensure that HIO’s needs are properly
met in regard to those concerns
mentioned above.
[33] As a result of the perceived negative impact of these attempts to ensure
that HIO’s personal and financial needs were
being properly met by her
attorneys a letter was sent to GB and VB by Walker Pender, Solicitors on 24
February 2006 upon instructions
from the attorneys advising that if they
continued with their actions, a domestic violence order would be taken against
them to prevent
or limit their contact with HIO.
[34] NW in her written material to the Tribunal confirmed the concerns raised by
the VB & GB that she considered HIO was not
eating properly and that she was
isolated in her home and needed help with cleaning the house and securing the
house at night.
[35] VB raised an issue at the hearing in regard to HIO’s hair care, in
particular the skin condition that she had treated
earlier in the year and the
haircuts that had been arranged for HIO. NW confirmed that HIO did not use
shampoo when she was staying
with her last year. HS said that HIO had oily hair
but the skin condition was not such a great concern.
[36] HC and his wife HS advised the Tribunal at the hearing that following
HIO’s diagnosis with diabetes, they were playing
a much more active role
in regard to her nutrition by attending the house to ensure that HIO was eating
appropriately in accordance
with a dietician’s recommendations. HS is now
a nominated carer with Centrelink and is receiving the carer’s allowance.
They confirmed that a wall-mounted air conditioner had been installed this year
although they said that HIO prefers not to use and
it could not be automatically
set. HC has stated that he will assist HIO to live in her own home until the
health authorities advise
that it is no longer appropriate for her to do
[37] HN confirmed that he sees his mother nearly every weekend but is not
involved in her day-to-day care. HN stated that an ACAT
assessment had been made
and that HIO was entitled to 9 weeks respite care a year but she would not
accept this. He said that arrangements
had been made with the Alzheimer’s
Association for her to have tea there on a Wednesday night to give HC and HS a
[38] The representative of the Adult Guardian, stated in the hearing that in
recognition of the conflict between the parties, it
would be appropriate for the
Adult Guardian to be appointed a guardian for
[39] HIO is unable to make appropriate decisions in regard to her personal
matters and requires a great deal of assistance to continue
living in her own
her environment in regard to heating
and cooling. She also needs assistance with
cleaning her house and washing her clothes. As her condition changes, decisions
are required
to ensure that her personal and health needs are being
appropriately met and that it is still in her best interests for her to continue
living in her own home. HIO’s current formal decision makers are her sons,
HC and HN, who are acting under an Enduring Power
of Attorney. They have done
their best to ensure that HIO support needs are identified and to provide her
with the care she requires
such as assistance with her medication, shopping and
meal preparation. They are assisted with this by their spouses, HS and HG.
[40] VB and GB also play an important role in HIO’s life, VB maintains
regular telephone contact and they visit HIO regularly.
It has been through the
efforts of the Bentleys that such things as the visits to the Alzheimer’s
Association and RSL Care
cleaning services are in place.
[41] Unfortunately, due to family conflict, VB & GB and the attorneys are
not able to work together to ensure that HIO’s
changing needs are
recognised and met. There is a history of involvement by solicitors, the Adult
Guardian and the Tribunal as a
result of VB & GB’s perception that HIO
is not having appropriate decisions made for her by the attorneys. The attorneys
of course in accordance with the General Principles of the
Guardianship and
Administration Act
are required to maintain HIO’s existing
supportive relationships.
[42] The Tribunal recognises the important roles that all family members play in
HIO’s life and the need to ensure that all
of them have a voice in regard
to decision making for HIO.
[43] Due to the conflict that exists between the parties, it is not appropriate
that the attorneys continue as attorneys for personal
and health matters or that
VB and/or GB be appointed as guardians for HIO.
[44] Therefore the Tribunal, being satisfied of the need for a guardian to be
appointed for HIO will appoint the Adult Guardian as
guardian for all personal
IS THERE A NEED FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ADMINISTRATOR?
[45] In his application, GB raised concerns about a lack of food in the house
and a history of unexplained withdrawals from HIO’
[46] He stated that apart from outings to the Alzheimer’s Association on
Wednesday and Saturday, HIO rarely goes out and leads
an extremely modest
lifestyle and yet there is no money left from the pension.
[47] In 2003 The Adult Guardian investigated the attorneys, HC and HN and
provided a report to the Tribunal dated 28 March 2003.
The specific allegations
investigated by the Adult Guardian were that:
HIO’s bank account is
being regularly accessed leaving her with insufficient funds;
HIO’s attorneys are not ensuring
savings are being made for HIO’s future
[48] The Adult Guardian found no evidence to substantiate either of these
allegations.
[49] Significantly, the same banking procedures which are in place now were in
place in 2003. Two bank accounts are used with the
pension being paid into one
and a second being used for bill payment. There is a fortnightly transfer to the
latter of $250.00; in
2003 this transfer was $190. At that time HIO was still
participating in banking and bill payment but as her capacity has diminished
the last couple of years the attorneys having taken over all of her financial
[50] In October 2005, VB made approaches to HIO’s bank and Centrelink
which resulted in letters being sent to those organisations
attorney’s solicitors, Walker & Pender, advising that HIO did not have
capacity and that her sons HN and HC were
her duly appointed attorneys. A letter
was also sent to the Bentleys by the attorneys requesting them to cease their
interference
in HIO’s personal and financial affairs as the attorneys were
[51] The attorneys provided the Tribunal with access to their records of
expenditure made on HIO’s behalf and confirmed the
balance of her bank
[52] The attorneys explained how they transferred $250 a fortnight from the
pension account to the bills account, and that savings
accumulated in that
account for such expenditure as the air-conditioner. HC advised the Tribunal
that he kept petty cash for HIO
for such items as visits to the
Alzheimer’s Association in a safe at home.
[53] GB referred to the photographic evidence he had provided which showed that
there was very little money being spent on food by
the attorneys and provided a
calculation of HIO’s monthly expenditure, which if correct, would show
that she should have more
savings than she currently has. On perusal though,
this calculation was flawed as it did not take account of there being 26
[54] The Tribunal is satisfied that HIO requires a decision maker in regard to
her finances as a result of her impaired capacity.
The Tribunal notes the
circumstantial evidence provided by GB suggesting that the attorneys were not
spending HIO’s money on
food, but having perused the attorneys’
records and their explanation of the procedure that they used to manage
finances, the Tribunal is satisfied that their management of her
finances was appropriate and that it was appropriate for them to
continue to
act. There is therefore no need for an administrator to be appointed for HIO and
the application for administration is
