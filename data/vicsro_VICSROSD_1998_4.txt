Application of section 64A(3) to
trustees and transfers of land
Revenue Ruling SD.094
Replaced by SD.095
This ruling replaces Revenue Ruling SD.072 which is
withdrawn following the Court of Appeal decision in
McKinnon Wallace Holdings v Commissioner of State
Revenue, 98 ATC 5181
(McKinnon Wallace)
The purpose of this ruling is to explain the effect of
statements made in the decision in McKinnon
Wallace to circumstances referred to in Revenue
Ruling SD.072.
The transfer or conveyance of real property is subject
to ad valorem duty under Heading VI of the Third
Schedule to the
Stamps Act 1958
(the Act), unless
an exemption applies. Generally property
acquisitions are evidenced by a conveyance under
general law or transfer of land pursuant to the
Transfer of Land Act 1958
Transfer of Land Act 1958
precludes the
registration of trust interests. A change of beneficial
ownership may therefore be effected without the
necessity for a registerable instrument.
Section 64A of the Act charges duty in
circumstances where the beneficial ownership of real
property is changed without an instrument of
transfer. Section 64A(3) deals specifically with the
circumstances whereby real property which is vested
in a person becomes the asset of a trust of which
that person is trustee.
Section 64A(3) applies in the following
circumstances.
a) A person is trustee for two trusts; Trust X and
Trust Y. The real property is vested in the person,
as trustee of Trust X, who later declares that the
property is held on trust for Trust Y.
The Supreme Court in
Lamattina & Sons Pty. Ltd.
v Commissioner of State Revenue (1996) ATC
held that section 64A(3) applied in these
circumstances.
b) Real property is vested in a person and that
person is, or becomes, a trustee of a trust.
The real property subsequently becomes an
asset of the trust.
Section 64A(3) requires that a statement be lodged
with the Commissioner of State Revenue and duty, at
ad valorem rates on the market value of the real
property, paid no later than 14 days after the
property becomes an asset of the trust. Any
declaration of trust will also be subject to duty as a
settlement chargeable with $200 under Heading IX
of the Third Schedule to the Act.
Revenue Ruling SD.072 stated that section 64A(3)
would apply where real property is vested in a person
in their own right and that person by declaration of
trust declares the property to be held on trust for
another person.
In McKinnon Wallace, the Court of Appeal held that
section 64A(3) could apply only where the trust was
in existence at the time the declaration of trust was
A change of beneficial interest evidenced by a
declaration of trust by the person in whom the
property is vested will no longer be regarded as
creating a liability to duty under section 64A(3).
Such a declaration will be liable to duty under
Heading IX and be considered to create a liability
to duty under the provisions of section 64B.
