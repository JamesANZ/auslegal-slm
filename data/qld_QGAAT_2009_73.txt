REASONS FOR DECISION
HISTORY OF THE APPLICATION
[1] MAJ is a 93 year old woman who until around April 2009 was living by herself
in her own home. MAJ had refused services and community
support. After being
found wandering in a shopping centre confused and disoriented she was admitted
to hospital for assessment. On
2 June 2009 the Tribunal received an application
for the appointment of a guardian and administrator from one of MAJ’s
The Issues and the Legislation
[2] The Tribunal may make an appointment order if it is satisfied that the
requirements outlined in
Guardianship and Administration
(“the Act”)
[3] The issues that the Tribunal must therefore consider are:
(a) Has MAJ impaired capacity for the matter?
(b) Is there is a need for a decision? and
(c) Without an appointment MAJ’s needs would not be adequately met or
adequately protected?
[4] If the above requirements are satisfied the Tribunal must consider who is
appropriate for appointment as a guardian or administrator
as outlined in
(1) of the Act.
THE PARTIES
[5] The applicant, HJ attended the hearing as did The Public Trustee Queensland
(PTQ) representative NB.
THE EVIDENCE
[6] In addition to the written material contained on the Tribunal file, all of
the parties attending the hearing were given the opportunity
to express their
views. These views, where specifically relied upon by the Tribunal, are
discussed below.
DOES MAJ LACK CAPACITY FOR THE MATTER?
[7] Schedule 4 of the Act states capacity for a person for a matter, means the
person is capable of understanding the nature and
effect of decisions about the
matter; and freely and voluntarily making decisions about the matter; and
communicating those decisions
in some way.
[8] The Tribunal considered the health professional report dated 8 May 2009 by
Dr H, general practitioner. Dr H stated MAJ had dementia,
was confused and could
not make any health, personal or financial decisions.
[9] The Tribunal also considered the report dated 18 May 2009 by Dr S,
neuropsychologist. Dr S stated MAJ has probable Alzheimer’s
dementia, had
been found wandering and confused, that she lacked insight into her cognitive
decline, that her ability to function
independently was compromised and that she
did not have the cognitive capacity to make competent lifestyle and financial
[10] MAJ’s daughter, MF, in a feedback form dated 18 June 2009 stated MAJ
was unable to make any financial decisions or any
health care or lifestyle
[11] At hearing, HJ agreed with the health professional reports and stated that
MAJ was out of touch with reality, had a vivid imagination
and forgets when she
has been to visit. HJ advised the Tribunal MAJ was in a high care secure unit at
an aged care facility requiring
full assistance with activities of daily
[12] The Tribunal is satisfied that the presumption of capacity to which all
adults are entitled has been rebutted.
IS THERE A NEED FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A GUARDIAN?
[13] At the time of application, MAJ was in hospital awaiting decision in regard
to her future accommodation. At hearing, HJ confirmed
MAJ had been placed in a
high care secure unit at an aged care facility. HJ advised this decision was
made with the support of her
sister, MF. HJ advised all services required by MAJ
were being met by the aged care facility. Furthermore, HJ indicated she was
to act as statutory health attorney for MAJ and advised that her sister,
MF, who was unwell, supported HJ in making health care decisions
[14] The Tribunal noted MF stated in her feedback form that she regarded her
sister HJ as the most suitable person to be guardian
[15] The Tribunal is satisfied that there is no need for the appointment of a
guardian for any personal, health/lifestyle decisions;
and that MAJ’s
needs and interests are being and could be met through informal decision making
and the statutory health attorney
IS THERE A NEED FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ADMINISTRATOR?
[16] Prior to hospitalisation and transfer to an aged care facility, MAJ was
living in her own home. MAJ is in receipt of a Department
of Veterans Affairs
War Widow’s Pension, has a Pensioner Savings Account and two Term Deposits
with the Commonwealth Bank of
[17] HJ is unable to access any funds from MAJ’s accounts and is meeting
the daily nursing home fees and accommodation fees
from her own funds.
[18] HJ advised the adult’s home is un-renovated and possibly uninsured.
HJ has organized for the electricity to be disconnected
and mail redirected.
[19] The Tribunal is satisfied that there is a need for the appointment of
administrator to manage MAJ’s property, investments,
pension and
accommodation fees need to be managed. The Tribunal finds that without the
appointment of an administrator MAJ’s
needs will not be adequately met or
her interests will not be adequately protected.
IF SO WHO SHOULD BE APPOINTED?
[20] The Tribunal received an application from HJ proposing she be appointed as
administrator for MAJ.
[21] MF in her feedback form dated 18 June 2009, supported HJ as administrator
by stating that without an administrator her sister
would be paying MAJ’s
financial commitments out of her own pocket and that she regarded her sister, HJ
as the most suitable
person to administer her mum’s affairs.
[22] Under cover letter (undated) MF provided the Tribunal with the ‘last
page’ of the feedback form again because it
had been ‘accidentally
misplaced’. This ‘last page’ signed and dated 17 July 2009
stated that, ‘The
Public Trustee of Queensland is best suited to organise
my mother’s financial needs in the future.’
Section 14(1)(b)
of the Act provides that the Public Trustee is also
eligible for appointment as administrator.
[24] The Tribunal noted HJ has been acting informally as administrator for MAJ
since she entered an aged care facility. HJ advised
that she had experience in
managing funds, being an owner/builder, preparing tax returns and doing
electronic spreadsheets. Furthermore,
HJ indicated that she intended to obtain
financial planning advice, property valuation and real estate advice. At hearing
she visited her mother weekly.
[25] HJ was surprised that her sister had changed her view in relation to her
(HJ’s) proposed appointment. HJ suggested this
change of mind may have
come about as she had recently refused to allow her sister to take property
(chairs) belonging to MAJ from
the adult’s house before the hearing. The
Tribunal noted that MF did not state any particular reason for changing her
for HJ as administrator. HJ indicated she would consult with her sister
before making decisions.
[26] The Tribunal is satisfied HJ is an eligible administrator pursuant to
and an appropriate appointee in accordance with the considerations
outlined in
of the Act.
