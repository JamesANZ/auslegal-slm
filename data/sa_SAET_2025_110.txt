applicant, Guang Yang, claims monetary amounts from the respondent, Fair Seafood
Pty Ltd (Fair Seafood), under the
Fair Work Act 2009
(Cth) (FW Act) for
unpaid annual leave, sick leave and superannuation.
respondent did not attend the hearing on 19 August 2025. Ms Franca Romeo, who
described herself as the contact person for Fair
Seafood, contacted the Tribunal
Registry whilst the hearing was in train. After the hearing concluded, Ms Romeo
sent an email in
which she stated that she understood that the hearing was to
proceed by telephone. The hearing notice advised that the hearing would
place at the Tribunal. Despite that I granted Fair Seafood liberty to make
written submissions which Ms Romeo provided within
the hearing Ms Yang tendered various documents in support of her case. Those
documents and the transcript of the hearing were
provided to Ms Romeo.
Attachments B1 to B11 to Fair Seafood’s written submissions were admitted
into evidence as exhibits R1
Yang claims that she was employed by Fair Seafood between 24 April 2023 and 15
April 2025. Fair Seafood’s written submissions
state that the employment
commenced on 1 May 2023. Ms Yang produced payslips which commence in the period
24 to 30 April 2023.
payslip is stated to be from Fair Fish (SA) Co-operative Limited ABN 36 946 118
322. Ms Yang’s written contract
of employment describes a further and
later commencement date but is plainly
The document appears to have
been created after the employment had commenced. The document is headed
“Fair Seafood PTY LTD”
but states the contract is between “The
Fair Seafood Unit Trust” and Ms Yang. It provides the “start date
be 22/07/2024”. The contract was not signed by Ms Yang until 17
October 2024. Based on Fair Seafood’s records, and the
first payslip in
particular, I find that Ms Yang’s employment commenced on 24 April
Seafood’s written submissions state that Fair Seafood Pty Ltd ATF the Fair
Seafood Unit Trust was established in March
2023 and that the company accountant
advised in April 2024 that was an error, and the employing entity is The Fair
Seafood Unit Trust
ABN 52 277 427 483 (the Trust). The written submissions state
that the error required re-entry of data, payroll and reporting but
contend that the claim has been made against the wrong entity. Exhibit R11
is a copy of an Australian Taxation Office (ATO)
receipt ID for Fair Seafood
which the written submissions state will permit the ATO to calculate interest on
the unpaid superannuation.
That suggests that Fair Seafood is Ms Yang’s
Annual leave
Romeo acknowledges that Ms Yang has been underpaid. She stated the following in
relation to annual leave:
Balance at end of employment: 178.87406 hours (Exhibit B3)
Final Net Termination Payment as outlined on Guang’s final payslip
$7,283.20 (Exhibit B4). This includes payment for Annual
Leave taken on
31.03.2025, Personal/Carer’s Leave taken 01.04.2025 to 11.04.2025 as per
Guang’s medical certificate supplied
by SAET on 21.08.2025 as Exhibit A6,
Unused Leave Payment of 178.87 hours and Leave Loading of 17.5% for 178.87
hours. These amounts
are subject to regular PAYG obligations.
The Amount of $7,283.20 will be paid in full into Guang’s nominated
bank account.
Yang claims an amount of $10,457.75 for unpaid annual
She stated that during the
term of her employment, the name of the employing entity has changed several
times, from Fair Seafood
originally, to the Trust, and back to Fair
The payslips Ms Yang
submitted state that she was paid firstly by Fair Fish (SA) Co-operative
Limited, then by Fair Seafood Pty Ltd,
then by Fair Seafood Pty Ltd ATF the Fair
Seafood Unit Trust and then by the Trustee for the Fair Seafood Unit Trust.
Yang has set out the basis of her calculation in writing and has specified
different rates and amounts payable for different periods
of time. She also
advised that whereas Fair Seafood’s records showed her as having 87.1867
hours of annual leave at 7 July
2024, the records show the balance as 66.2 hours
just one week later on 14 July 2024, without her having taken any paid leave
consider the calculations performed by Ms Yang to be more reliable and accurate
than the records of Fair Seafood, which Ms Romeo
acknowledged needed to be
recalculated.
Seafood is to pay Ms Yang $10,457.75 for unpaid annual
Superannuation
Romeo provided the following detail in relation to Ms Yang’s outstanding
entitlement to
superannuation:
I have provided a breakdown of superannuation accrual in line with Guang’s
Exhibit A2.
01/05/2023 – 25/06/2023 $498.64 (Exhibit B5)
26/06/2023 – 09/07/2023 $142.77 (Exhibit B6)
10/07/2023 – 23/06/2024 $5,407.10 (Exhibit B7)
24/06/2024 – 07/07/2024 $297.00 (Exhibit B8)
Total 01/05/2023 – 07/07/2024 $6,345.51 (Exhibit B9)
Total 08/07/2024 – 13/04/2025 $6,463.00 (Exhibit B10)
We have undertaken a bottom up audit of all of our obligations and as such have
been working closely with the Australian Taxation
Office to bring all
outstanding obligations up to date. Therefore, all totals from Exhibit B9 &
B10 have been lodged with the
Australian Taxation Office via a Superannuation
Guarantee Charge Statement. This process includes an automatic calculation of
interest payable (Exhibit B11).
total amount payable as calculated by Ms Romeo is $12,808.51. Ms Yang
claims $13,089.29. As Fair Seafood has lodged documentation
with the ATO and as
the amount payable will include an up-to-date calculation of the amount of
interest payable, the order will be
that Fair Seafood is to pay Ms Yang
$12,808.51 plus interest at the prescribed rate.
Yang took two weeks of sick leave towards the end of her employment which she
claimed totalled 80.8117 hours. She claimed that
she was mentally unwell and
unable to work or focus on her work by reason of continuing to not be paid
despite frequently raising
that issue with Ms Romeo. The absence was
covered by a sickness certificate.
Romeo did not challenge the genuineness of Ms Yang’s absence from work. In
her written submissions, Ms Romeo wrote that Ms
Yang was a highly skilled team
member for whose departure has not been able to be filled by any other person.
Having seen the diligence
Ms Yang devoted to presenting her case, the comment is
not surprising.
Yang submitted that her ordinary hours of work were 40 hours per week and the
rate of pay was $35 per hour. Ms Romeo did not disagree.
Those amounts appear in
the written contract of employment. There will be an order that $2,800 is
payable for outstanding sick leave.
Pecuniary penalties
contraventions of a modern award under s 45 of the FW Act are:
A failure to pay
all hours worked;
A failure to pay
all annual leave;
A failure to pay
annual leave loading; and
A failure to pay
superannuation.
contravention of the National Employment Standards under s 44 of the FW Act is a
failure to pay accrued leave and leave loading
upon the cessation of Ms
Yang’s employment.
Practices Commission v CSR Limited
, French J listed a range of factors that
assist to determine what a suitable penalty is. They are: the nature and extent
of the conduct;
the circumstances in which the conduct took place; the nature
and extent of any loss or damage sustained; any similar previous conduct;
whether contraventions are properly distinct or arose out of one course of
conduct; the size of the business enterprise involved;
whether or not the
contraventions were deliberate; whether senior management was involved in the
contraventions; whether the party
committing the contraventions has exhibited
contrition; whether the party committing the contraventions has taken corrective
whether the party committing the contraventions has co-operated with the
enforcement authorities; the need to ensure compliance with
minimum standards by
provision of an effective means for investigation and enforcement of employee
entitlements; and the need for
specific and general
deterrence.
Romeo submitted the following in relation to pecuniary
Finally, in relation to the pecuniary penalties sought under
sections 44
Fair Work Act 2009
(Cth), we respectfully ask your
Honour to consider the circumstances outlined above. It has always been our
genuine intention to fulfil
all payment obligations to Guang once the required
documentation was in place. Throughout this period, we were also in
communication
with the ATO to address a number of longstanding issues that have
impacted our business over the past 12 months.
We acknowledge that this situation has not been ideal, but we have faced a range
of extenuating circumstances and have learned important
lessons as a result.
Despite multiple attempts to make contact, matters unfortunately became
overwhelming. Additionally, it is important
to acknowledge the sudden and
unexpected departure of a valued and respected staff member. In reflection, it
was surprising how quickly
the tone of our text communications shifted over the
course of just a few days. Guang was a highly skilled team member, and even
write this, we have yet to find someone who can adequately fill the gap left by
her unexpected departure. Compounding these
difficulties has been the impact of
a significant algae bloom over the past five months, which has further disrupted
our operations.
We respectfully ask that our commitment to our staff and our ongoing efforts to
support the business be taken into account, and that
Your Honour consider that
the imposition of a penalty may not be warranted in these circumstances.
Thank you for your time, and I sincerely apologise for any inconvenience or
delay caused throughout this process.
circumstances of this matter are regrettable. Fair Seafood valued Ms Yang
but underpaid her over a protracted period of time.
Not surprisingly,
Ms Yang reached a point where she was not willing to tolerate that
is no evidence of prior similar conduct by Fair Seafood. The non-payment of
annual leave and superannuation are continuing courses
of conduct while the
failure to pay sick leave is more accurately construed as a one-off breach. The
scale of the employer’s
operation is small. There are extenuating
circumstances. I accept that Fair Seafood received bad advice about its legal
accounting processes and that contributed to the underpayment because
the records were inaccurate. Ms Romeo’s marriage broke
down during
the period in issue. Fair Seafood has acknowledged its failure to pay Ms Yang,
has expressed contrition and has approached
the ATO to remedy the
is no need for specific deterrence given the acknowledgement that Mr Yang has
been underpaid and the steps taken to remedy that.
The need for general
deterrence remains. It is not appropriate to not impose any pecuniary penalties
as submitted by Fair Seafood.
Pecuniary penalties of $2,000 in relation to
unpaid sick leave, $8,000 in relation to unpaid annual leave and $12,000 in
to unpaid superannuation will be ordered. The total amount payable by
Fresh Seafood to Ms Yang is therefore $48,066.26 plus the amount
interest payable on unpaid superannuation calculated by the ATO.
Yang also sought payment for time she took off work to attend the Tribunal to
pursue her claim. There is no basis for such an award
in the FW Act and I
decline to make one. I make the following orders:
21 days the respondent, Fair Seafood Pty Ltd, is to pay the applicant, Guang
Yang, the following sums:
$10,457.75 for unpaid annual
$12,808.51 plus interest at the rate prescribed by the Australian Taxation
Office for unpaid superannuation;
$2,800 for unpaid sick-leave;
$2,000 as a pecuniary penalty for unpaid sick-leave;
$8,000 as a pecuniary penalty for unpaid annual leave;
$12,000 as a pecuniary penalty for unpaid superannuation.
parties have liberty to apply in relation to the amount of interest payable on
the unpaid superannuation.
