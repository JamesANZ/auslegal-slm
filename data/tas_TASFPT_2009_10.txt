Forest Practices Authority (FPA) to certify a Forest
Practices Plan (FPP)
proposing the clearing and conversion to pasture of approximately 180 ha of
his land on King Island.
FPP was proposed in documents sent to Mr Graham Wilkinson, Chief Forest
Practices Officer (CFPO) at FPA by letter TAS Land &
Forest per Brett Miller
May 2008. The form in which the FPP was proposed has some
continuing relevance, as appears later.

32.2o/o,33.6o/o and about 36o/o. Whilst these
figures justify the statement of
lack of statistical confidence in estimation of remaining native vegetation at

only legislative specification of minimum level appears in
TGPMPNFE at 30o/o and the evidence was that it had not been reached: hence

of species or native vegetation communities which may be threatened
proposed clearing.
Such a survey was obtained and presented in time for the Tribunal’s
appointment on 19
October 2009, when it certified the
Appellant’s FPP.
Appellant has applied for costs. Power to award costs is in the Forest
Practices Act 1985, S37(13) –“The Tribunal
may make such order as to
costs as it thinks necessary”. The costs which the Appellant seeks are for
“the 21 days that
it took to prepare my appeal, the travel costs
associated with my appearance at the appeal and some consideration for the 12
of time lost in the conversion to pasture of the

we wish specifically to deal:
the FPA’s refusal of the FPP, for its second reason, was reached as a
matter of rote – “just another day at
the office”, and without
due diligence and prudence and was frivolous or careless. We reject these
assertions: the FPA’s
June 2008 and the estimations
mentioned in paragraph 4 above demonstrate to the contrary we think. Nonetheless
on this issue the
Appellant succeeded clearly and immediately.
Appellant and other farmers on King Island appear for many years to have been
treated with equivocation and vacillation with respect
to policy in relation to
the use and occupation of King Island. So that, for example, the
Appellant’s application for compensation
is rejected because his land is
“scrub” but his application to clear it is rejected because it is
In these respects the Tribunal lends its authority to the
Appellant’s objections and concerns.
Appellant was obliged, from the start, to provide evidence for the FPA (and the
Tribunal) that his proposal will not threaten
native flora or fauna: he has done
so and must bear the cost of doing so.
as he said, that cost would be irrelevant and hopeful only until and unless he
received a favourable determination on the issue

remaining should his proposal for clearing and conversion to pasture be
claim for time lost in converting to pasture is one for loss of opportunity and
is in the nature of a claim for compensation rather
than “costs”,
and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain it.
FPP had yet, as at 19
October last because, we take it, of the
form in which it was made, to comply with all requirements of the Forest
practices Code.
these reasons we think it necessary, and fair in the working of administrative
public decision making that the Appellant have
his costs against his opponent on
that issue.
the order just made may be a Pyrrhic order, costs will not include time for
personal time spent or lost in formulation or
presentation on appeal as to the
FPA’s second reason for refusal. The High Court’s decision
v Hanes & Anr
[1994] HCA 14
(1994) 179 CLR 403
illustrates this, that an order for
“costs” is for an indemnity or partial indemnity for those
professional legal costs
actually incurred in the conduct of the dispute. The
Appellant’s costs here ordered will include costs of travel to and from
the forum resolving the dispute.

decisions and orders are of the date when they were made and pronounced: those
