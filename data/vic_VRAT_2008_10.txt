MR C. WINNEKE appeared on behalf of Harness Racing Victoria

D E C I S I O N
HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against both conviction of misconduct and
penalty in the form of a fine $1000. Mr R Lee was given
appear for the appellant and Mr C Winneke appeared on behalf of the Harness
Racing Victoria Stewards. On 2 May 2008 a Stewards'
Inquiry was conducted at
the offices of Harness Racing Victoria, into the conduct of the appellant, Mr R
J (Bob) Mahncke, a licensed
trainer/driver of some thirty five years standing,
at the Warragul Cup meeting on Sunday 23 March 2008. Mr Mahncke appeared in
Stewards conducting the inquiry were the Chairman,
Mr Brant Dunshea, General Manager Racing Integrity Services, together
James Hitchcock, Stipendiary Steward and
Ms Stacey Ryan, Assistant Steward.
The Chairman read into the transcript prepared statements of the
witnesses for the Stewards, who subsequently gave evidence before
morning. Towards the conclusion of the inquiry it was temporarily adjourned and
then the appellant was charged and subsequently
convicted of misconduct under
Rule 231(2) with respect to his conduct towards the Chairman of Harness Racing
Victoria Mr Neil Busse,
which the Chairman of the inquiry stated to be
unprofessional and unacceptable in nature. The rule in question reads, "A
shall not misconduct himself in anyway".
The matter came before this Tribunal this morning on appeal by way of
rehearing. Mr Gerard Hendricks, the Harness Racing Victoria
occupational health
and safety manager, and Mr Neil Busse, gave evidence on oath for the Stewards
and were cross-examined. In addition
the appellant himself and Mr Robert
John Gleeson, the President of the Victorian Harness Racing and Trainers and
Drivers Association
of some 20 years standing gave evidence in support of the
On the balance of probabilities the Tribunal makes the following
findings as to what occurred. At an early stage of the Warragul
Cup meeting Mr
Hendricks, having observed that the appellant was not wearing a licence
identification on a lanyard around his neck,
challenged him as to his presence
in a restricted area, namely the horse stables. Recently introduced
occupational health and safety
regulations bar entrance to the restricted area,
to all but licensed participants and day pass holders.
The appellant was wearing his licence identification on his belt, which
apparently Mr Hendricks did not notice. Nor did Mr Hendricks
know, because of
his recent appointment to his managerial position, that the appellant was a well
known trainer of some 35 years
standing. A heated exchange took place between
them. Subsequently the appellant approached Mr Busse who had attended the
in his capacity as Chairman of Harness Racing Victoria along with his
wife, as guests of the Warragul Harness Racing Club. The approach
was outside
the club's function area and a number of racegoers were in the vicinity.
The appellant complained about the new horse movement policy, which
required inter alia the wearing of a licence identification
card and precluded
owners from access to their horses in the stables. He stated amongst other
things that Mr Hendricks was driving
people from the industry. Mr Busse
responded that Mr Hendricks had the full support of the Board. During this
discussion the appellant
in a loud voice asked Mr Busse how much he earned, and
how much Mr Hendricks was being paid. Further he stated that Mr Busse's
were being paid by the Board, that Harness Racing Victoria was going
backwards; that stakes in Western Australia were higher than
Victoria, and that
Harness Racing in New South Wales and Queensland would leave Victoria
Mr Busse retorted with the suggestion that if he thought this was so he
should take his horses and piss off to New South Wales.
Subsequently after a
horse trained by the appellant had won the Warragul Cup, and the appellant had
been presented with the trophy,
Mr Busse approached him and said that if he
had any personal issues with him, he could make an appointment and come and see
The appellant said he would like to bring five or six others with him,
including Graham Lang, to which Mr Busse replied, "Oh, the
hero", or words to
that effect. The significance of this comment was lost on me and never
explained, but it terminated the conversation.
At one stage the appellant
complained that only $19 million was being distributed in prize money, and
asked what about the other
14 million.
He was referring to the alleged difference between what Tabcorp was
distributing to Harness Racing Victoria, and what was being
paid out in prize
money. The difference of course was being spent on the maintenance and
development of Harness Racing tracks, and
support of Harness Racing clubs. Mr
Busse did not understand what the appellant was referring to because the
difference was not
14 million, and he did not take it as reflection on his
integrity. But he was upset understandably by loud accusations inferring
he was overpaid and not working enough hours while Harness Racing Victoria was
going backwards. Other bystanders could hear
the appellant's loud complaints
and at some stage, according to the appellant, agreed with some of his comments.
In my view to confront the Chairman with these public accusations by a
licensed trainer was not only offensive to the Chairman personally,
demeaning to the Harness Racing Industry and it constituted misconduct. On the
other hand the Tribunal accepts that the appellant
was motivated by a love of
and genuine concern for Harness Racing, which had suffered economically from a
combination of factors
including equine influenza, rising fuel costs, the
drought with rising feed costs and people were consequently leaving the industry
as trainers, drivers, breeders and owners.
Nevertheless these valid points should have been made in private; not
in the public domain at a race meeting. The appeal therefore
against conviction
is dismissed. I might say that I have had the advantage of discussion with my
two advisers, but the decision
itself of necessity by the legislation is my own
although I have been assisted by such discussions. We go now to the question of
D E C I S I O N
HIS HONOUR: There have been two previous offences of this nature
resulting in fines of $200 and $250 respectively. The appellant
has also been
cautioned in respect of a similar outburst, and he has been expelled from the
Terang Club for similar conduct. It
is obvious that he is an extremely volatile
person. The Tribunal takes into account the extenuating circumstances already
by my remarks in the course of the ruling, and has decided that what
whilst the fine $1000 will stand only $500 of that is payable
at this stage.
The balance is suspended but payable in the event of a further offence of a
similar nature during the next five years.
I should say this, Mr Mahncke, that you are obviously a good trainer
and I noticed in last month's Harness Racer that you are in
the top ten and your
strike rate seemed to me to be the best of them or almost the best of them. So
you have obviously a lot of
talent but you are just too volatile and it is
essential that you hold your tongue, hence the Tribunal has decided that for the
five years you have got a potential liability of an extra $500 should there
be a similar offence for which you would also be penalised
of course. So it is
something that you must bear in mind in the future. At the same time the
Tribunal has a lot of sympathy for
the motivation which resulted in these
outbursts. You have got a genuine concern for harness racing. You have been in
harness racing
for a long, long time. You are very competent in what you do,
and so on that account the Tribunal is sympathetic to you, but at
the same time
if you have got a complaint by all means make it but make it in private whether
it be to the Chairman of Harness Racing
Victoria or any other official to whom a
complaint should be addressed. I order that the appeal deposit be refunded. I
two advisers for their assistance, but I re-emphasise the fact that the
decision is my own as it must be under the legislation.
I thank both
Mr Winneke and Mr Lee for their assistance. That concludes the inquiry - -
