The application
Julieanne Syme, the mother of the applicant in the substantive proceeding,
Anthony Syme, has made application for an order that
she be appointed litigation
guardian for her son. The substantive proceeding is an application to review a
determination of the respondent
dated 30 April 2025. By that determination, the
respondent rejected an application that Mr Syme be treated, on an interim basis,
as a seriously injured worker. The respondent has not opposed the making of the
order sought by Ms Syme.
application has been made primarily pursuant to Rule 107(1)(a) of the
Australian Employment Tribunal Rules 2024
(the SAET Rules) which empowers
the Tribunal sitting in court session to appoint a parent as litigation guardian
of a person who
is under a legal incapacity.
Syme was born on 26 August 1991. He was employed by the Old Red Brick Co Pty Ltd
and the respondent has accepted Mr Syme suffered
a work injury by way of a
traumatic brain injury on 9 March 2023. Mr Syme has also submitted claims for
compensation asserting a
work injury to his left shoulder, left knee, right
knee, and his neck. By letter dated 30 April 2025, Employers Mutual Limited
as nominated claims agent for the respondent, rejected Mr Syme’s
application to be treated on an interim basis as a seriously
injured worker
pursuant to
(the RTW Act). It did so
on the basis that it concluded upon the evidentiary material before it that Mr
Syme’s level of whole
person impairment (WPI) would not reach at least a
35% WPI, being the relevant threshold to be treated, on an interim basis, as a
seriously injured worker. Mr Syme has sought a review of that determination by
the Tribunal.
support of the application by Ms Syme to be appointed litigation guardian, the
Court was provided with an affidavit of Mr Syme’s
solicitor Roberto
Clemente sworn on 30 October 2025 and an affidavit of Ms Syme sworn on 24
October 2025. I have had regard to the
contents of those affidavits. Exhibited
to the affidavit of Mr Clemente was a medical report of clinical psychologist Dr
Emma Fitzgerald
dated 3 October 2024. She assessed significant cognitive and
behavioural impairments. Also exhibited to Mr Clemente’s affidavit
medical report of neurosurgeon Paul Carney dated 1 October 2024. He diagnosed Mr
Syme as having suffered a severe head injury
with extensive intracranial
bleeding, and probable subarachnoid and subdural cerebral contusions. He noted
difficulty with attention
and concentration, and more so with multiple task
demands. Dr Carney noted difficulty attending to and recalling instructions, and
particularly so when more than one piece of information is provided. He
considered these impairments to be permanent.
views of the severity of the traumatic brain injury were expressed by Dr Gary
Clothier in a report dated 12 November 2024
which was also exhibited to Mr
Clemente’s affidavit.
arranged for Mr Syme to be assessed by clinical neuropsychologist Dr Michael
Wood. He has provided a recent report dated 17 September
2025. He too expressed
the view that Mr Syme had suffered a very severe brain injury and he saw no
reason to disagree with Dr Clothier’s
conclusions in relation to Mr
Syme’s cognitive deficits.
Syme has made application to the South Australian Civil and Administrative
Tribunal (SACAT) which concluded that Mr Syme has a
mental incapacity and that
an administration order appointing Ms Syme should be made.
her affidavit, Ms Syme deposes to having a strong relationship with her son. She
provides assistance with respect to domestic tasks
in the home, and has been his
primary support person attending to his day to day needs. She has confirmed that
she was appointed
full administrator of her son’s estate by the SACAT on
14 April 2023 as a result of Mr Syme’s mental incapacity, and
order was reviewed and confirmed by the SACAT on 13 December 2024.
Syme has deposed to her understanding of the responsibilities associated with
being appointed litigation guardian and has provided
an assurance to the Court
that she would act in accordance with those responsibilities if appointed.
Consideration
factors to take into account in determining whether a litigation guardian should
be appointed, once satisfied that the Court is
empowered to do so, were
addressed in
Price v Department for Education
, I referred to the judgment of Kyrou J in
Slaveski v State of Victoria &
and I distilled
from those reasons the following principles in determining whether a litigation
guardian should be appointed:
is a presumption that a person of full age is capable of managing his own
affairs which includes the management of litigation
to which that person is a
an application is made then the person who alleges the contrary bears the onus
of persuading the Court.
is no universal test for determining whether a person is capable of managing his
or her affairs. Lack of mental capacity is
usually denoted by a person’s
inability to understand the nature of an event or transaction when it is
explained to that person.
a person to continue to be a party in litigation that person must understand the
nature of the litigation, its purpose and its
possible outcomes including the
risks with respect to costs.
such as “in relation to the proceeding” in a relevant rule brings
focus on the person’s ability to bring or
defend a particular proceeding,
rather than whether the person is able to manage his or her affairs generally.
a person is a self-represented party to a proceeding, the level of mental
capacity required to be a capable litigant will be
greater than that required to
instruct a lawyer because a litigant in person has to manage a court proceeding
in an unfamiliar and
stressful situation.
Ordinarily,
the Court will determine whether a party has the requisite capacity after
receiving medical evidence. However, where
a party’s incapacity in
readily apparent from his or her behaviour inside the courtroom, the Court may
be able to make the
determination without the assistance of medical
a litigation guardian is appointed, he or she stands in the shoes of the person
under a disability and must act in the interests
of that person. The litigation
guardian has the conduct of the proceeding, including the responsibility for the
engagement of legal
representatives and the giving of instructions about the
calling of witness and the settlement of proceedings.
Court retains supervision of the appointed litigation guardian and may remove
the litigation guardian of a protected person (whether
or not appointed by the
Court) on any reasonable ground and may permit or appoint some other person to
be the litigation guardian.
have been persuaded by the evidence and submissions before me that
notwithstanding Mr Syme being of full age, he is not capable
of managing his own
affairs and that includes the management of the current litigation. I find that
Mr Syme currently does not understand
the nature of the litigation, its purpose,
and its possible outcomes including the risks with respect to costs. In reaching
conclusion, I have taken into account the medical evidence before me, the
contents of the affidavits of Mr Clemente and Ms Syme,
and the administration
order made and confirmed by the SACAT. I have not found it necessary to conduct
a hearing in court and require
the attendance of either Ms Syme or Mr Syme.
am satisfied that it is appropriate to make the declaration and order sought.
Declaration and order
declare that the applicant Anthony Syme is a person under a disability such that
a litigation guardian needs to be appointed.
order that the applicant’s mother Julieanne May Syme be appointed
litigation guardian for the applicant until further order.
