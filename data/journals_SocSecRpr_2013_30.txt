EL-MOUSTAFA and SECRETARY to the DSS
Formal decision
Newstart Allowance: date of deemed receipt of notice
EL-MOUSTAFA and SECRETARY to the DSS
Decided: 26th September 2013 by R. Perton
El-Moustafa received newstart allowance (NSA) from 14 January 2011 at the
single rate. Centrelink cancelled her NSA later that year
with the effective
date being 9 August 2011. Her NSA was later reinstated from 12 December 2011.
During the period August to December
2011, there were two major issues relating
to her payments, one concerned the failure to lodge a reporting statement, which
NSA recipients
are required to do periodically on a date specified by Centrelink
and the other was a Centrelink decision on 9 August 2011 that El-Moustafa
member of a couple. She told the Tribunal that she had not lodged the reporting
statement because she had not received the
relevant correspondence from
Centrelink.
Whether El-Moustafa was entitled to arrears of NSA between 9 August 2011 and
11 December 2011?

The issue as to whether El-Moustafa was entitled to arrears of NSA between 9
August 2011 and 11 December 2011 turned on whether she
had sought review within
13 weeks of notification of the automatic cancellation of NSA.
The automatic decision to cancel El-Moustafa’s NSA due to her failure
to submit a reporting statement was made on 6 September
2011, a Tuesday.
Centrelink’s letter was posted to her on the same day.
The Tribunal found that it was appropriate to apply the deemed date of
receipt according to the provisions set out in
section 160
noting that four working days are allowed for service of mail under
that provision.
This resulted in a deemed date of receipt of the following Monday, namely 12
September 2011. The Tribunal calculated thirteen weeks
after 12 September 2011
to be 12 December 2011.
The Tribunal referred to a Centrelink file note on 6 December 2011 which
.... as more than 13 weeks since cancellation cust [omer] will be required to
reclaim as she did not lodge required form,as no payment
made after 9/8/11 there
are no arrears payable at this time, appeal system updated to show decision has
been implemented.
The Tribunal found that the premise that it had been 13 weeks since
notification on 6 December 2011 was not correct because whilst
Centrelink had
made the decision on 6 September 2011 to cancel El-Moustafa’s NSA she was
not told about the decision on that
date. As a result, she was deemed to have
received notification of the cancellation by 12 September 2011.
The Tribunal noted that had El-Moustafa been properly advised that she was
still within the 13 week period up to and including 12
December 2011 and
therefore the opportunity to explain her reasons for failing to lodge the
reporting statement she may well have
qualified for payment in the period
between 9 August 2011 to 11 December 2011. The Tribunal also noted that an SSAT
decision concerning
her marital status was made on 24 November 2011 and had
referred back to 9 August 2011 as the relevant date for payment.
The Tribunal found that had El-Moustafa realised that she had to make a
separate review application on or before 12 December 2011
in relation to the
cancellation for failing to lodge the reporting statement she would have done
so, referring to Centrelink records
showing that El-Moustafa had applied for
review after being advised that she was not receiving NSA payments back to 9
August 2011.
However the date for review was one week outside the 13 week
The Tribunal went on to consider whether El-Moustafa’s fresh claim or
other contacts with Centrelink within 13 weeks of the
cancellation decision
could be deemed to also amount to a request for review but ultimately decided
that none of the contacts could
be regarded as such.
The Tribunal found however that the provision of incorrect information about
the actual expiry of the 13 week period and the two-week
delay between the SSAT
decision concerning El-Moustafa’s marital status had directly impacted on
her situation and recommended
that the Department consider an ex-gratia payment
in this case noting that it did not usually recommend such a response in its
reasons for decision.
Formal decision
The decision under review was affirmed.
