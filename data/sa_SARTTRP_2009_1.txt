REASONS FOR ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL MADE ON
Hearing 7 January 2009 at Adelaide
MICHAEL ANGELOU PTY LTD TRADING
AS HAHNDORF RESORT AND CONVENTION CENTRE v HARRINGTON (RP08/0085)
APPLICATION LODGED 29 December 2008
ORDERS SOUGHT Vacant possession and payment of outstanding electricity
RESIDENTIAL PARK SITE AGREEMENT DETAILS
Site: 28 Bavarian Way C\O Hahndorf Resort SA 5245
Owner: Michael Angelou Pty Ltd trading as Hahndorf Resort and Convention
Centre (“the Park”)
Resident: Phillip Harrington
Agreement Commenced: 1 January 2008
Period of Agreement: Periodic
Rent: $128.00 per week
This Residential Park Site Agreement comes under the
Residential Parks Act
SWORN EVIDENCE
was given in person by:
REPRESENTATIVE Emmanouel Pishas
From Michael Angelou Pty Ltd trading as Hahndorf Resort and Convention
Centre (“the Park”)
The resident and anyone who lives at the site were given notice of the
hearing. The resident was not at the hearing.
The resident is still in possession of the site.
The resident contacted the Tribunal and made an offer of payment.
I accept that a Notice of Termination (Form A) dated 24 November 2008 was
served on the resident claiming outstanding electricity
accounts totalling
$548.97 had not been paid.
The Notice of Termination is not correct as I find the resident was not
indebted to the owner for this amount for electricity. Following
the hearing I
recalculated the outstanding electricity charges as set out in the Tax Invoices
tendered at the hearing and I find
that at the date of the notice the resident
was only indebted to the owner for the sum of $420.97 for electricity. The
amount claimed
in the Notice included a weekly rent charge of $128.00 which was
not 14 in arrears at the date of the Notice.
Mr Pishas tendered a Notice of
Termination – End of Agreement (Form C) dated 24 November 2008 which
requires the resident to
vacate the site in not less than 90 days after service
of the Notice. The Notice expires on 25 February 2009.
At the hearing Mr Pishas identified a claim of $539.77 for electricity usage
which I find again includes a weekly rent charge. I am
however satisfied on the
evidence that the resident is currently indebted to the park owner in the sum of
$411.77 for electricity
Mr Harrington has contacted the Tribunal and offered to pay all the
outstanding electricity accounts on 31 January 2009. I am of the
view that some
payments should be made before that date. During the hearing I decided that the
resident could remain at the site
but only if payments are made as ordered. I
indicated that in default of these payments the resident would be required to
of the site if the payments were not made in full and on time. After
reconsidering this matter I have decided that if the resident
misses a payment
the owner may apply to the Tribunal to end the agreement without first serving a
Notice of Termination on the resident.
ORDERS: made under
sections 68
of the Act):
1 The resident must pay $100.00 by 5:00PM on Friday 16 January 2009 and
$311.77 by 5:00PM on Saturday 31 January 2009. If the resident
misses one of
these payments the owner may apply to the Tribunal to terminate the agreement
without serving a Notice of Termination.
