Amalgamation. Meaning of 'contiguous'.

& JOSO JELIC v THE DEPARTMENT FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRIES &
[2010] SAWC 3
note these claims are only joined at one corner. Since the directions hearing I
have researched the matter. The claims must be
‘contiguous’, the
word used in regulation 15 as a condition required before they can be
amalgamated.
Shorter Oxford Dictionary
states that ‘contiguous’ means
‘touching, in contact, adjoining’ or ‘continuous’ or
loosely ‘neighbouring’.
This implies some continuous contact rather
than joining only at a single point, the corner of each.
view is consistent with a policy that amalgamations are to facilitate the mining
of a resource that extends to beyond one claim,

join on a corner of each so that no working across the boundary is in practice
rule that ‘contiguous’ in this context means having a common
boundary for a significant length. If two claims are not
so joined their labour
conditions cannot be amalgamated. This is consistent with earlier rulings of
this court. The application
is refused.
