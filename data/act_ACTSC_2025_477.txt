) against a grant of representation for the
estate. The grounds for her objection are described in the caveat as
The caveator challenges the validity of any will of the
deceased on the grounds that the deceased lacked testamentary capacity to
will; or any will was obtained fraudulently by Zelka Prpic and Anita Prpic; or
the deceased was suffering under duress from
Zelka Prpic and Anita Prpic.
the Will, the Testator appointed his twin sister, Anita Ginoski (formerly known
as Anita Prpic), as executor of his estate. The

four siblings, was to
be his executor.
23 June 2025 Anita Ginoski renounced her position as executor, on the express
understanding that Zelka Prpic, would replace her
as executor of the Will.

Test for testamentary
Timbury v Coffee
[1941] HCA 22
(1941) 66 CLR 277
at 283, Dixon J quoted with approval
this passage:
Before a will can be upheld it must be shown that at the time of making it the
testator had sufficient mental capacity to comprehend
the nature of what he was
doing, and its effects; that he was able to realize the extent and character of
the property he was dealing
with, and to weigh the claims which naturally ought
to press upon him. ... (per Hood J.,
In the Will of Wilson
[1898] VicLawRp 39
, at p. 199).
Boreham v Prince Henry Hospital
(1955) 29 ALJ 179
the High Court held at
The proper approach of the Court to the question whether a testator has
testamentary capacity is clear. Although proof that the will
was properly
executed is prima facie evidence of testamentary capacity, where the evidence as
a whole is sufficient to throw a doubt
upon the testator’s competency, the
Court must decide against the validity of the will unless it is satisfied
affirmatively
that he was of sound mind, memory and understanding when he
executed it or, if instructions for the will preceded its execution,
instructions were given.
The evidence
following affidavits were read:
(a) Zelka Prpic affirmed on 17 June 2025;
(b) Zelka Prpic affirmed on 10 September 2025;
(c) Anita Ginoski affirmed on 17 September 2025;
(d) Zachary McBride affirmed on 17 September 2025.
was no evidence from the defendant.
four siblings, including the Testator, lived with their parents until their
parents divorced in around 1990. The Testator was
then around 7 years of age.
The father subsequently obtained a court order for the sole custody of the four
leaving school, the Testator undertook an apprenticeship as a painter. At the
time of his death he was not married and he did
not have any children.
was the evidence of Anita Ginoski and Zelka Prpic that until their father died
in January 2022, the Testator had not had a relationship
with his mother, Maria
Mrvcic, for over thirty years. However, after their father’s death, the
Testator expressed a desire
to reconnect with their mother. They supported the
Testator as they thought it might provide him with some comfort during his grief
for their father. However the encounter was brief, and the Testator reported to
them she was living in poor conditions lacking basic
household items.
evidence discloses that the Testator had long standing issues with depression
and anxiety for which he regularly sought treatment
and support.
Ginoski says that the Testator decided to make a fresh start after the death of
his father. He moved in to live with her and
her family from April 2022 to
October 2022 while he was making arrangements to move to Queensland. As I have
said, the Will was made
on 1 July 2022.
Ginoski said that, during this period, she helped the Testator attend
consultations with a general practitioner for additional
support and is aware
that his employer arranged for him to attend free counselling services.
assets would be distributed in accordance with his
wishes. She was aware that he
consulted a solicitor. She was sent a copy of the Will at the time.
Ginoski observed that, while the Testator lived with her, he exhibited clear and
rational thinking, was fully autonomous in
his decision making, and maintained
control over his personal affairs. This was evident, she said, from his ability
to maintain his
regular work routine and to arrange the sale of his townhouse.
is in evidence a consultation note made by a general practitioner who recorded,
on 21 April 2022, a history of intermittent
depression/anxiety for over 10
later consultation note made by a general practitioner on 2 June 2022 records
that his mental health had improved, the medication
was working well and he felt
60 percent better.
Prpic lived in Queensland in 2022 but was in frequent contact with the Testator.
She said that the Testator was focusing on
getting more exercise and there is in
evidence a text message he sent to Zelka Prpic on 23 July 2022 with a photo of a
bicycle with
the message “bike ride”. He then came and lived with
her from October 2022 to April 2023 during which he obtained a job,
drove to and
from work and attended a fitness boot camp. He also attended on a psychiatrist
in Queensland. The testator became homesick
and moved back to Queanbeyan.
Testator’s mental health deteriorated leading to a suicide attempt and an
admission to a mental health unit in late 2023.
By 2024 his mental health had
declined significantly and in January 2025 he took his own life.
McBride was the solicitor who drafted the Testator’s will. He is a witness
to the Testator’s signature on the
Will. It is his evidence that, at the
time of signing, he had no concerns for the Testator’s capacity and has no
recollection
of the Testator being anything but normal.
that a will was properly executed is prima facie evidence of testamentary
evidence that could be seen as tending in favour of a finding of incapacity is
the Testator’s longstanding issue with depression/anxiety.
persuaded that these conditions were severe enough, as at 1 July 2022, to
displace the presumption. In making this finding
I rely on the doctor’s
note on 2 June 2022, the solicitor’s evidence and the evidence of his
capacity as described by
his sisters. These matters collectively outweigh any
possible inference of incapacity arising from the Testator’s mental health
issues which, at the time the Will was signed, were not severe.
I am wrong in concluding that the presumption has not been displaced, then, for
the reasons I have given in the preceding paragraph,
I am satisfied that the
Testator had testamentary capacity at the time he signed his Will.
is no evidence before me of the other two matters asserted in the caveat - that
the Will was obtained fraudulently or that the
Testator was suffering under
duress from Zelka Prpic and Anita Prpic.
Accordingly,
I propose to set aside the caveat.
Prpic sought an order for costs. I propose to make this order as I have made the
order she sought in her Originating Application.
orders of the Court are:
(1) The caveat filed by the defendant on 17 February 2025 is set aside pursuant
to r 3069(4) of the
Court Procedures Rules 2006
(2) The defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the proceedings.
