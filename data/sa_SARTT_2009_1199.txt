Sworn or affirmed evidence was given by
The landlord’s Agent: Sue Partington
Tenant Tina D'Agostini
The landlords originally lodged an application for vacant possession on the
basis of the tenant's failure to pay rent. The agent had
served a Form 2, notice
of breach for failure to pay rent on 4 August 2014.
Subsequently the landlords lodged a further application in the Tribunal
seeking an order to terminate the tenancy on the grounds that
the agreement had
been frustrated due to a fire at the property. The landlords served a Form 2B on
the tenant in which they stated
“ the premises have been destroyed or rendered
uninhabitable”
The notice required the tenant to vacate on Friday 14 November 2014.
Evidence and submissions of the parties
The parties agreed that:-
there was a fire
at the property on 20 October 2014;
since the fire
Ms D’Agostini has been living in a rumpus room (which was formerly a
garage) and she also has use of a carport;
D’Agostini is not accessing the house at all and is able to access the
rumpus room without going through the house;
Initially power
was disconnected from the property but it has since been restored;
D’Agostini has no running water in the rumpus room and is currently using
bathroom facilities at her neighbours’ house;
investigators are still working to determine the cause of the fire;
D’Agostini ceased paying rent after the fire.
The evidence and submissions of the agent
Ms Partington referred to her written submission. She also gave evidence that
she is concerned that the property is not safe. She
said that she has been
unable to obtain a written opinion from a builder or loss assessor as to the
safety of the property.
Ms Partington referred to photos which she had submitted and which show
extensive damage to the property from the fire. In addition
the photos show a
car jack apparently holding up a section of the roof.
Ms Partington said that the landlords would prefer to have possession of the
property so that any necessary repairs can be carried
out and then the property
can be sold. She referred to a statement by an insurance assessor to the effect
that repairs cannot be
carried out unless the property is vacant.
In addition Ms Partington said that since the fire some asbestos has been
discovered in the eaves of the building and the landlord
is concerned about the
ramifications of that.
The evidence and submissions of the tenant
Ms D’Agostini said that she has lived at the property for approximately
20 years and has a number of pets there with her. She
said that it has been the
family home for her children and a niece and nephew. She also said that prior to
the fire she had made
an offer to buy the property from the owner but there was
no contract in writing. She said she has been pre-approved for finance
is unsure of her current situation due to the fire. She said that she would be
meeting with a finance broker soon after the
Ms D’Agostini sought to remain living in the property while the repairs
were being carried out and said that she considered
it was safe to do so. She
referred to conversations with builders supporting that view. She had no written
report to that effect.
Ms D’Agostini said that she had ceased paying rent as it was unclear
what her obligations were in that regard given that a significant
part of the
house was unable to be used until the repairs were carried out.
Ms D’Agostini said that the car jack in the roof space was placed there
due to an incident completely unrelated to the fire
and she had forgotten about
During the hearing Ms D’Agostini requested that the Tribunal contact a
builder Daniel Hoffrichter by phone. Ms D’Agostini
said that he would
inform the Tribunal that the house was not uninhabitable and it was not
The Tribunal did contact Mr Hoffrichter who asked that we put any questions
to his supervisor Michael Pitt. Mr Pitt is an insurance
estimator. He informed
the Tribunal that the kitchen will require replacement and the bathroom is not
functional. He said that he
would not recommend for anyone to live there.
Conclusions and findings
On the basis of the photos provided by the agent, the evidence of the agent
and the tenant and Mr Pitt’s evidence, my assessment
is that the property
is uninhabitable for the following reasons.
The photos show extensive smoke and fire damage throughout the entire
property (except for the rumpus room). Mr Pitt has said that
the kitchen needs
to be replaced.
Ms D’Agostini is unable to use the bathroom and has no
access to running hot and cold water until the repairs are carried out.
I have some concerns about the car jack in the ceiling space and the
asbestos, but even without those issues having been raised on
the basis of the
damage from the fire, my conclusion would be that the property is
uninhabitable.
Therefore I find that the notice of termination is valid. This means that the
tenancy is terminated. The question I must now consider
is whether or not to
make an order for possession of the property.
As I have found that the property is uninhabitable I consider there is no
option but to make an order for possession. However, in
view of the length of
time for which Ms D’Agostini has lived in the property and in order to
allow her a reasonable opportunity
to make arrangements to purchase of the
property, I will allow her to remain in the property until Monday 15 December
As I mentioned in the hearing, if the parties wish to vary that order by
consent because of developments after the hearing they may
make a written
request to the Tribunal for a consent order.
At the hearing both parties sought guidance from the Tribunal in relation to
The Tribunal does not generally set rent however, I indicated that in the
circumstances I considered rent of about 1/3
ordinary rent would be fair.
The tenant must vacate the property at midday on Monday 15 December 2014.
If the tenant does not move out this order may be enforced
by the Tribunal
