_____________________________________________________________________
The Complainant was an employee of the Respondent who
made a bullying complaint against co-workers. The complaint documentation
of a letter outlining the outcomes the employee sought, and a
chronological list of all of the bullying incidents alleged to have
The Complainant met with a staff member of the Respondent who explained the
complaint process, and advised that a full copy of the
Complainant’s
documentation would be provided to each of the alleged bullies. The Complainant
agreed to this in the belief
that there was no other choice, but later attempted
(via email) to withdraw consent as she was anxious about the information
in the complaint, which had documented her private reactions to
certain incidents. On receiving the Complainant’s email, a
staff member
advised the Complainant that the complaint documentation had already been
forwarded to the unit manager (an alleged
bully), who had further distributed it
to other staff members (all alleged bullies) in accordance with the
Respondent’s internal
The Complainant alleged that the disclosure of the complaint documentation to
the alleged bullies breached her privacy under IPPs
2.1, 4.1 and 1.3. She
alleged that each staff member mentioned in the complaint was given the
Complainant’s bullying complaint
in its entirety. This included the full
list of bullying incidents, and the Complainant’s reaction to each
incident. The
Complainant also argued that the alleged bullies should only have
had access to the information that was relevant to each individual
rather than
the entire document containing all alleged incidents. Furthermore, the
Complainant alleged that the policy that the
organisation provided her with in
relation to how her information would be handled was out of date.
Organisation’s Response
In responding to the complaint, the Respondent argued that, even if it had
received the Complainant’s withdrawal of consent
prior to distribution,
disclosing the Complainant’s documentation – in full – was a
necessary part of the investigation
process. Further, it felt that it was
‘not reasonably possible’, to edit the Complainant’s
documentation before
distribution.
The Privacy Commissioner found that where an organisation receives a
complaint about one or more of its staff members, an investigation
complaint will require the organisation to disclose the basis and necessary
details of the complaint to the relevant individuals.
This is so that
individuals have the right of response, and the allegation can be properly
investigated. Such a disclosure needs
to be made in a way that protects the
organisation must
disclose only what the individuals ‘need to know’
in order to respond to the complaint.
IPP 2 – Use & Disclosure
The Privacy Commissioner decided that the disclosure of all of the
Complainant’s documentation in full (setting out the Complainant’s
state of mind, emotional responses to the incidents, and outcomes sought) to all
of the alleged bullies appeared to be far more than
what they needed to respond
to the complaint about their own alleged behaviour. Disclosure of information
in this context should
have been kept to the minimum necessary to investigate
the matter and would not require the wholesale disclosure that had occurred
this instance.
The Privacy Commissioner considered that it was possible to edit the document
provided in order to protect the Complainant’s
that an investigation process requires an organisation to collate the
information provided in a complaint
and reasonably determine what needs to be
disclosed to each staff member. Although some of the incidents alleged involved
one staff member (and therefore details of the incident would need to
be disclosed to all in that particular case), it was possible
to edit the
document to protect the Complainant’s privacy.
The Privacy Commissioner decided that the Complainant’s consent could
not be relied on, as under 2.1(b) individuals must be
provided with a real
choice about what will happen with their personal information. The Complainant
was merely told that disclosure
of her complaint documentation to the alleged
bullies was part of the complaint investigation procedure and that there was, in
no other option.
IPP 4 – Data Security
The Privacy Commissioner also found that by providing more information to the
alleged bullies than was necessary, the Respondent had
not taken reasonable
steps to protect the personal information it held under IPP 4.1.
IPP 1.3 – Notice
The Privacy Commissioner found that there was some confusion as to which
version of the organisation’s internal policy document
the Complainant
received. The Privacy Commissioner considered that this resulted in the
Complainant being uncertain as to how her
information would be used.
The complaint was successfully conciliated with the organisation apologising,
agreeing to change its policies relating to bullying
investigations and paying
compensation.
