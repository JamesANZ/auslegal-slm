REASONS FOR DECISION
10 June 2025, the applicant applied to the Queensland Police Service
) under the
Information Privacy Act 2009
I request under the Information privacy act.
Documents related to the traffic stop , and matters thereafter as to
oversight of the action/s.
Body cams , in car camera/s
Notes , diary entries , workbook.
Radio communication.
Transcripts of body cam.
O.I.C ethical standards, Privacy complaint consideration/s of all matters
fairy related to events.
Traffic stop Miriamvale 2025.
The reticence as to release documents is held to be in line with the obvious
failings of Q.P.
The threat of arrest for declining to provide a email address is nazi like
dross ,which I can get in court.
I have no computer terminal access
I have no device that permits forms
Hence the email.
Should email be again refused efforts as to ensure inclusion (and prevent
discrimination inherent in refusing emails are options for
clearly Q.P seek
advantage, and Inherently detriment ).
refused to deal
with the access
application on the basis it did not provide sufficient information to enable a
responsible officer to identify relevant
documents, and therefore did not meet
all relevant application
requirements.
The applicant sought
internal review of QPS’s decision. By decision dated 28 August 2025, QPS
affirmed the original decision.
applicant then applied to the Office of the Information Commissioner
) for external review of QPS’s
decision under external review is QPS’s internal review decision dated
28 August 2025, refusing to deal with the access
application.
issue for determination is whether the access application gives sufficient
information to enable a responsible office to identify
relevant documents and
whether QPS is entitled to refuse to deal with the application.
the reasons below, I affirm the decision under review.
Evidence considered
evidence, submissions, legislation and other material I have considered in
reaching my decision are as disclosed in these reasons
(including in footnotes).
I have also had regard to the
Human Rights Act 2019
) particularly the right to seek, receive and impart
information.
I consider a
decision-maker will be ‘
respecting and acting compatibly
’ that right and others prescribed in the HR Act when applying the
law prescribed in the IP Act.
have acted in this way in making this decision, in accordance with section 58(1)
of the HR Act.
Relevant law
making an access application for documents under section 43(1) of the IP Act, an
applicant must comply with the application requirements
set out in sections
43(2) and 43(3) of the IP Act.
43(2)(b) of the IP Act provides that the access application must give sufficient
information concerning the documents sought
to enable a responsible officer of
the agency to identify the documents.
Information Commissioner has previously recognised that where there is ambiguity
in the terms of an application, it is rarely
appropriate to apply legal
construction techniques in preference to consulting with the applicant for
clarification.
The scope of an
access application should not be interpreted legalistically or
– however, there are
sound practical reasons for the documents sought to be clearly and unambiguously
identified, given the
terms of an application set the direction and parameters
of an agency’s search
a person purports to make an access application that does not comply with all
relevant application
requirements,

efforts to contact the person within 15 business days after the purported
application is received
person how the application does not comply with the relevant application
requirement; and
applicant a reasonable opportunity to consult with a view to making the
application in a form complying with all relevant
application requirements.
after giving the applicant a reasonable opportunity to consult with a view to
making the application in a form complying with
all relevant application
requirements, the agency then decides that the application does not comply with
all such requirements, the
agency must give the applicant prescribed written
notice of the
line with the obligation under section 53(2) of the IP Act, QPS wrote to the
explaining how the
application did not meet all relevant application
requirements.
Relevantly, QPS
An applicant must make their application in a way that allows the agency to
identify the documents the applicant is seeking. The onus
is on the applicant to
identify the documents they want to access, not the agency.
Your application appears to seek documents relating to a traffic interception
involving yourself in Miriam Vale in 2025. However,
your application also refers
to Ethical Standards Command and privacy related matters, without further
information to assist in identify
the matters to which you refer.
15 July 2025 to 29 July 2025, the applicant sent QPS multiple
After considering the
terms of the access application, the additional information provided by the
applicant to QPS, and the external
application,
I expressed my
preliminary view to the applicant
While it is clear that you are seeking documents relating to a traffic stop
at Miriamvale on
your correspondence with QPS has not clarified
your request for ‘O.I.C ethical standards, Privacy complaint
consideration/s
of all matters fairy related to events’.
As QPS advised you on 15 July 2025, the phrasing of this request makes it
difficult to identify what Privacy complaints or matters
before the Ethical
Standards Command you are referring to. Your responses to QPS have not clarified
this issue, especially when you
have referred to different privacy complaints
If you have made a privacy complaint about the Miriamvale traffic stop on
or consider that Ethical Standards Command were involved in a
complaint stemming from the traffic stop, it is my view that it is
necessary for
you to clearly state this. Otherwise, as it is currently phrased, the
application lacks sufficient information for
a reasonable agency officer to
identify the documents you are seeking.

NO, Luhrs and do not ask ever again as to informal.
Q.P are free to seek to engage as to matters.
The fact that some 10 requests have been made over 5 months with not a single
document being made available , speaks to Q.P bad faith,
discrimination,
vindictive and malice.

I am not satisfied that
the applicant has provided sufficient information to clarify the request for

clarified if they seek documents about a privacy complaint or Ethical Standards
Investigation,
relating to complaints they made about the Miriamvale traffic
stop. Rather, the applicant has referred to other processes, including
complaint about QPS’s use of the applicant’s name in email

Date: 8 October 2025
On 1 July 2025 key parts of
the Information Privacy and Other
Legislation Act 2023
(Qld) (IPOLA Act) came
into force, effecting changes to the IP Act and
Right to Information Act 2009
(Qld) (RTI Act). As the applicant’s application was made before this
change, the IP Act and RTI Act as in force prior to 1
July 2025 remain
applicable to it. This is in accordance with transitional provisions in Chapter
8, Part 3 of the IP Act and Chapter
7, Part 9 of the RTI Act, which require that
applications on foot before 1 July 2025 are to be dealt with as if the IPOLA Act
not been enacted. Accordingly, references to the IP Act and RTI Act in this
decision are to those Acts as in force prior to 1 July
2025. These may be

On the same day, the
applicant sent a second email to QPS which duplicated much of this request.
However, the later email includes
further requests of how the applicant would
like QPS to communicate with them.

, when addressing similar considerations under
the predecessor to the IP Act, the repealed
Freedom of Information Act 1992
(Qld) (FOI Act) the Information Commissioner noted that: ‘The terms in
which an FOI access application is framed set the parameters
agency’s response under Part 3 of the FOI Act, and in particular set the
direction of the agency’s search efforts
to locate all documents of the
agency which fall within the terms of the FOI access request. The search for
relevant documents is
frequently difficult, and has to be conducted under tight
time constraints. Applicants should assist the process by describing with
precision the document or documents to which they seek access’. These
