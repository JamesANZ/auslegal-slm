Strata Schemes Division
APPLICATION NO : SB01/00553
SCHEME : SP63769
ADDRESS OF : 1 Regent Place
SCHEME REDFERN NSW 2016
APPLICANTS : Owners Corporation
RESPONDENT : The Owner Corporation
APPLICATION : Allocation of unit entitlements
Pursuant to
section 183(1)
Strata Schemes Management Act
the unit entitlements among the lots in Strata Plan 63769 are allocated
in the following manner:
Unit Entitlement
Unit Entitlement
REASONS FOR DECISION
THE APPLICATION
On 21 August 2001 an application was lodged on behalf of the owners
corporation for an order for the re-allocation of unit entitlements.
reasons given for applying were that the owners corporation believed that the
unit entitlement had been incorrectly assessed.
The application was accompanied
by a valuation report prepared by Leon George Cheneval, a certified practicing
valuer dated 16 April
THE VALUATION REPORT
In the valuation
report submitted with the application the following appears under "Schedule
Observations".
"The existing schedule is by the terms of the Act in
our opinion unreasonable. Lots 15 and 16 have an existing entitlement of 167
u.e with comparison the units next door 13 and 14 which are larger have existing
u.e of 137. The two lots above that are identical
have u.e’s of 141
therefore there is a discrepancy of some 30 u.e’s points for lots 15 and
The relevant date of this assessment is 13 December 2000. The
Valuer describes his valuation approach and procedure as well as the
evidence and analysis relied upon. A certificate of value is given for each of
the lots as determined at the relevant date.
Other documents lodged in support
of the application as schedules include a copy of the registered strata plan and
a sales schedule
and analysis of unit entitlements.
A submission had
been made by Mr Cooper an owner of a number of lots in the scheme dated 2
October 2001 opposing the application.
THE HEARING
The owners corporation was represented by Mr Bryant, a strata managing agent.
Mr Leon George Cheneval gave evidence expanding on
his valuation report and was
crossexamined by Mr Cooper. Mr Cheneval gave evidence that he had had
considerable experience valuing
lots for the purposes of unit entitlements. In
the present case, the discrepancy which had been first noted was that between
15 and 16 on the one hand and 13 and 14 on the other, referred to in his
report. He then proceeded to assess the values of all the
lots. He repeated
the methodology outlined in the report and stated that the process involved
taking into account the transfer price
of the lots, the commercially available
data base and so on. He had also factored in such matters as developer’s
discounting
and lots bought off the plan. His response to the submission to Mr
Cooper that none of the studio apartments had sold for anything
valuation was that it may well be that since the relevant date of valuation,
there has been a decrease in value. Some units
did not attract the same rents.
However he still stood by his valuation.
Mr Cheneval was crossexamined extensively by Mr Cooper.
Cooper gave evidence and made submissions which may be summarised as
The effect of the valuation report was to
substantially increase the unit entitlement of the studio apartments when
compared with
the larger, more expensive 2 bedroom apartments. This is a
substantial shift of the burden of levies.
The valuation did not reflect the
reality. He had purchased 3 studio apartments at $166,000.00 each. None of the
studio apartments
would attract the price indicated by Mr Cheneval valuation.
Mr Cooper produced a letter from a real
estate agent (Ray White Real Estate) to support his contention that the
valuation given by
Mr Cheneval would not be sustainable in the market place.
Although Mr Cooper had not obtained another valuer’s report, he
Tribunal to take those matters into account, as
section 183
(3) provided that,
in addition to the respective values of the lots, such other matters as are
considered relevant may be taken into
account by the Tribunal.
FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION
Section 183
provides (in part) as follows:
183 Order for reallocation of unit entitlements
(1) Tribunal may make order allocating unit entitlements
Tribunal may make an order allocating unit entitlements among the lots that are
subject to a strata scheme in the manner specified
Sub-section 183(2) provides that an order may be made only if the
Tribunal considers that the allocation of unit entitlements among
the lots was
unreasonable when the strata plan was registered.
183 Order for reallocation of unit entitlements
(2) Circumstances in which order may be made
An order may be made only
if the Tribunal considers that the allocation of unit entitlements among the
(a) was unreasonable when the strata plan was registered or when a
strata plan of subdivision was registered, or
(a1) was unreasonable when a
revised schedule of unit entitlements was lodged at the conclusion of a
development scheme, or
(b) became unreasonable because of a change in the
permitted land use, being a change (for example, because of a rezoning) in the
ways in which the whole or any part of the parcel could lawfully be used,
whether with or without development consent.
The matters to be taken into
consideration in making a determination under the section are the respective
values of the lots and (if
a strata development contract is in force in relation
to the strata scheme) such other matters as the Board (this Tribunal) considers
For the purposes of the present case the essential issue is
the respective values of the lots at the relevant time. The only expert
evidence before me is that of Mr Cheneval’s who has the requisite
qualifications under the
Valuers Registration Act 1975
. While Mr Cooper
is entitled to attempt to discredit Mr Cheneval’s valuation, in the end
result in my assessment the evidence
which emerged both in cross examination and
in Mr Cooper’s case did not have the effect of discrediting Mr
evidence nor his valuation report. There was no other
competing evidence as to the value of the lots at the date of registration
the strata plan. I have to conclude that I must accept Mr Cheneval’s
report and additional oral evidence as to the respective
values of the lots.
Further, the conclusion which must be drawn from the values accorded to
each of the lots and contrasted with each of the original
unit entitlements is
that the allocation
unreasonable. (In particular the respective
values of lots 15 and 16 when compared to 13 and 14). Once accepted, the only
evidence before me leads to an allocation of unit entitlements in
accordance with the valuation. It is true that the effect is to
increase the
unit entitlements (hence the levies) of the studio apartments by something in
the order of 11% to 12%. At the same
time the unit entitlements of two bedroom
lots will be proportionally less. As indicated however, once I accept the
valuation I
must make an order allocating unit entitlements in accordance with
the valuation.
Order made accordingly.
John Bordon
Residential
30 January 2002
Pursuant to section 46 of
the Residential Tribunal Act 1998 the order made on 4 January 2002 is amended to
indicate that the unit
allocation for Lot 41 is 400.
