EX TEMPORE REASONS FOR
ALDRIDGE J:
1 Appeals NOA 84 of 2020 and NOA 85 of 2020 are
listed before the Court today for consideration of their summary dismissal.
2 Appeal NOA 84 of 2020 is against orders made by the primary judge on 1
December 2020, where his Honour:
judgment in the property proceedings between the parties which were heard on
that date, substantially in the absence of the
Adjourned the
parties’ competing parenting applications to a Case Management Hearing on
29 January 2021;
Ordered that a
copy of the orders giving the Independent Children’s Lawyer (“the
ICL”) leave to withdraw be provided
to Legal Aid Queensland with a request
to appoint a substitute ICL;
Discharged a
number of subpoenas to witnesses to attend to give oral evidence; and
Dismissed the
appellant’s Application in a Case filed on 18 November 2020 which sought
interim orders.
3 A Notice of Appeal was filed on 14 December 2020.
4 Appeal NOA 85 of 2020 concerns orders made on 9 December 2020. The
proceedings concerned the parties’ children who were born
in 2011, 2013
and 2014. At the time, orders of the Court provided for the children to live
with the respondent and to spend time
with the appellant each alternate Saturday
and Sunday between 9.00 am and 5.00 pm. Changeover was to occur at a
5 The children spent time with the appellant in accordance with the orders on
6 December 2020. At 4.15 pm she advised the contact
centre and the respondent
that she would not be returning the children.
6 On 9 December 2020, the primary judge made a recovery order for the return
of the children to the respondent, restrained the appellant
from removing the
children from the respondent’s care until further order and suspended the
time the children were to spend
with the appellant.
7 A Notice of Appeal was filed on 14 December 2020.
8 The respondent filed an Application in an Appeal in each appeal seeking
orders for security of costs on 21 December 2020. That application
was granted
by Tree J on 22 April 2021 and the appellant was required to lodge $15,000 with
the Brisbane Registry as security for
costs in appeal NOA 84 of 2020 and another
$15,000 in appeal NOA 85 of 2020. Both appeals were stayed until the payment was
9 The payment has not been made.
10 On 27 July 2021, the Regional Appeals Registrar wrote to the appellant
noting that the appeals were listed for hearing and that
the orders of Tree J
had not been complied with. The letter advised the appellant that the Court
would, at the hearing of the appeals,
consider whether they should be summarily
dismissed pursuant to r 22.45 of the
Family Law Rules 2004
11 Pursuant to r 22.45(2)(a)(i), the Court may dismiss an appeal if the
appellant has failed to comply with an order in relation to
an appeal and may do
so on its own initiative.
12 The letter served as notice that the Court would consider such a
13 The appellant submits that appeals NOA 84 of 2020 and NOA 85 of 2020
essentially raise the same points as appeal NOA 11 of 2021,
which has been heard
today also, and they will therefore require no additional expenditure by the
respondent. She also submits that
the order will stifle the appeals because she
cannot afford to pay the sums as ordered. These are arguments that substantially
to challenge the orders for security themselves. It is not our task to
review those orders.
14 More broadly, the appellant asserts that the children are at a grave risk
of harm living with the respondent and she seeks orders
in each appeal that the
children be returned to live with her. That issue is the subject of continuing
proceedings in the Court.
The parenting aspect of the orders, which are the
subject of the appeal, are an order for their adjournment, dismissal of an
application and the issue of a recovery order which has been
15 The substantive issue of what parenting orders are in the best interests
of the children remains before the Court. In these circumstances,
it would be
most unlikely that this Court would embark itself on testing and weighing that
evidence to determine the appropriate
orders but would remit any outstanding
parenting issues for hearing by a trial judge. In short, dismissal of these two
appeals will
not affect the trial process that is underway.
16 There is no likelihood that the orders of Tree J will be complied with in
the foreseeable future. There is no utility in appeals
from interim orders being
indefinitely stayed.
17 Taking these matters into account I consider that both appeals should be
dismissed and I propose orders to that effect.
18 I agree with the orders proposed and the reasons
given by Aldridge J.
19 I also agree.
ALDRIDGE J:
20 The orders of the Court will be:
(1) Appeal No. NOA 84 of 2020 be dismissed.
(2) Appeal No. NOA 85 of 2020 be dismissed.
