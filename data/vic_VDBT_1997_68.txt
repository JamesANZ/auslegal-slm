PRESIDING MEMBER:
Mr A.T. Kincaid
ORIGINATING DOCUMENT:
Application dated 16 January 1997
APPEARANCES:
Mr Andrew Laird, of Counsel, on behalf of the
Mr D.J.P. Seymour on behalf of the Respondent
DATE OF HEARING:
22 August 1997
DATE OF DETERMINATION:
15 September 1997
REASONS FOR DETERMINATION
On 20 January 1997 the Applicant filed an
application against the Respondent seeking the recovery of $57,284, being monies
the Applicant to claimants, as follows:
Claim/Ref No.
Date Payment Approved
Amount Paid
Relevant Owner
22 October 1993
Augerinos, Brighton Road, East St Kilda
3 January 1996
Dodd, Byrne Street,
Port Melbourne
8 March 1996
Dodd, Byrne Street,
Port Melbourne
22 December 1995
Dodd, Byrne Street,
Port Melbourne
Less amount received
2. The Respondent seeks to challenge the entitlement of the Applicant to
recover this amount. The basis on which it can do so has
been narrowly
circumscribed for the reasons set out in paragraph 3 and 4 below.
3. During a hearing on 21 May 1997, relying on a chronology provided to him,
Dr Cremean found that the payment made by the Applicant
in the amount of $40,527
to the Augerinos was made on 13 October 1993 consequent upon the Augerinos
obtaining an order on 2 September
1993 on a counter-claim in a
Magistrates’ Court proceeding against the Respondent in the amount of
$42,317.57. On 28th October
1994 the Respondent appealed to the Appeals
Committee of the Respondent in regard to the decision by the Applicant to make
to the Augerinos, and on 7 March 1995 that Appeal was dismissed by the
Appeals Committee. On 3 April 1995 the Respondent appealed
Administrative Appeals Tribunal and 1 December 1995 the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal dismissed that appeal. In these circumstances,
Dr Cremean found that
the Respondent had exhausted his appeal rights in respect of the decision by the
Applicant to make payment
of $40,527 to the Augerinos. Dr Cremean also found
that the Respondent was only entitled to challenge the entitlement of the
to recover the amount of $40,527 by challenging the bona fides of the
Applicant in making the decision to seek recovery from the
Respondent (see in
this respect the decision of
Gaywood Constructions Pty Ltd
, Domestic Building Tribunal, 13 September 1996, A307/96).
4. During the hearing on 21 May 1997, again relying on the chronology
provided, Dr Cremean found that in regard to the three payments
referred to
above made by the Applicant to Mr Dodd, the Respondent had not chosen to appeal
within the relevant times (60 days from
4 September 1995 in regard to claim
73984 and 60 days from 13 September 1995 in regard to claim 76307). Dr Cremean
found that the
right of appeal was therefore extinguished, following his
decision in
Gionaka v HGFL
, 13 July 1996, Domestic Building Tribunal, 30
July 1996. Therefore Dr Cremean found that in regard to the Dodd claims, the
was again only entitled to challenge the entitlement of the Applicant
to recover the respective three sums mounting to $28,884 by
challenging the bona
fides of the Applicant in making the decision to seek recovery from the
Respondent.
5. At a subsequent Case Management Conference on 16 June 1997 Dr Cremean
directed that the Respondent, if challenging the bona fides
Applicant’s decision or decisions should file and serve on the Applicant
an affidavit setting out points of defence
limited to the issue of bona fides,
and the Applicant was given leave to file and serve any answering affidavits. I
deal with the
affidavit material as follows.
The Augerinos’ Claim
6. In the affidavit sworn by the Respondent on 14 July 1997 he contended, in
effect, that the Magistrates’ Court Order referred
to in paragraph 3 above
was obtained by the Augerinos not because their claim had any merit but because
the Respondent had difficulty
securing the services of competent professional
adviser, because the Respondent’s rights had been compromised by the
of clause 8 of a so-called "Consent Agreement" dated 26 November 1991
drawn on his behalf following arbitration proceedings between
the Respondent and
the Augerinos, the effect of section 19(1)
House Contracts Guarantee Act 1987
the context of the subsequent court proceedings, and because of other matters.
The relevant portion of the affidavit concludes
that the fact "that [the
Applicant] has not taken [these] facts into consideration is a failure to act in
good faith when deciding
to pay Augerinos the amount stated above and in
deciding to proceed against [the Applicant] for recovery of that sum".
7. For the reasons referred to above I make no inquiry into whether or not
the Applicant acted in good faith "when deciding to pay
[the] Augerinos" the
relevant amount. Even if I were to do so, I would hold such an assertion cannot
be sustained having regard
to the provisions of
House Contracts
Guarantee Act 1987
which obliges the Applicant to make payment where liability
of an approved builder to a building owner is established as a result
proceedings.
8. The Affidavit sworn by Mr Mackwell on behalf of the Applicant states that
the matters raised in the Respondent’s Affidavit
"do not go to the issue
of challenging the bona fides of the Applicant in deciding to recover the
relevant sum" for the reasons set
out in Mr Mackwell’s affidavit. His
affidavit states that "in processing the claims lodged against the Respondent"
(and, presumably,
in deciding to recover the relevant sum from the Respondent)
the Applicant was not obliged to re-examine and re-open matters the
the so-called "consent agreement", the arbitration or the Magistrate’s
Court proceedings, nor was it obliged to
examine whether the Respondent had been
represented properly in either of the proceedings by his legal
representatives.
9. There is nothing in the Applicant’s Rules to which I have been
referred which would have obliged the Applicant, when it decided
recovery from the Respondent, to have regard to matters referred to in paragraph
6 above. I conclude that there is no evidence
to indicate that the decision by
the Applicant to seek recovery of the amount of $40,527 from the Respondent was
made other than
in a bona fide manner. If, indeed, the Respondent considers
that he would not have been found liable to the Augerinos by the Magistrate
for the negligence advice received from his legal representatives or other
professionals (whether at the time of the so-called
"consent agreement" or at
any later stage including the hearing) then his remedy lies elsewhere.
The Dodd Claim
10. In the Affidavit sworn by the Respondent on 14 July 1997 the Respondent
makes plain his misapprehension that the respective amounts
of $1,700, $2,924
and $24,260 sought by the Applicant are in respect of a claim by Mr Dodd for
"alleged non-treatment of termites"
initially rejected by the Applicants. This
is not the case, and in order to assist the respondent I shall endeavor to
explain why.
The Termite Claim by Dodd
11. (a) It is true to say (as the Respondent does in paragraph 6 of
his affidavit) that Mr Dodd appealed against the refusal
by the Applicant to
accept Mr Dodd’s claim in respect to termites. It is not, however,
correct to say (as the Respondent says
in paragraph 6 of his affidavit) that the
respondent was given no notice of the appeal, that he was accordingly not in a
to make any submissions, and that the Appeals Committee of the
Applicant reversed the decision of the Applicant to reject the claim.
fact occurred was that by letter dated 27 June 1985 the Respondent was advised
had appealed against the decision of the Applicant dated 3
May 1995, by letter dated 2 August 1995 from the Applicant to the Respondent
Respondent was advised that "this appeal [viz. the owner’s appeal] was
listed for hearing on 21 September 1995. It appears
that by letter dated 2
October 1995 the Respondent was advised that the appeal had been listed for 31
October 1995. By letter dated
31 October 1995 from the Applicant to the
Respondent the Respondent was advised that "the appeal" had been listed for 21
1995. By letter dated 4 December 1995 from the Applicant to the
Respondent the Respondent was advised that
"the owner’s appeal"
been adjourned to a date to be fixed in 1996. By letter dated 23 January 1996
from the Applicant to the Respondent the Respondent
was advised that "the
appeal" had been listed for 28 February 1996. By letter dated 4 April 1996 the
Applicant advised the Respondent
that "the appeal" would be transferred to the
Domestic Building Tribunal for hearing. It appears that the owner’s
never proceeded with, resulting in the Respondent not being subject
to any liability in respect of the termite claim.
(b) It is not clear why the Respondent fell into the
misconception that he owners had successfully appealed in respect
"termite claim" and that [Appeals Committee had] reversed the [ original]
decision of the Applicant, as alleged in paragraph
6 of the Respondent’s
affidavit. Although the Respondent states in paragraph 5 of his affidavit that
he appealed against the
[Appeal Committee’s] decision to uphold Mr
Dodd’s appeal there is no evidence that this was the case, or evidence to
suggest that such an appeal by the Respondent was ever necessary in relation to
the termite claim.
(c) The letter from the Applicant to the Respondent dated 4
December 1995 makes it clear that the appeal which was the
subject of the
adjournment was "the owner’s appeal". I can only surmise that the reason
why, perhaps in hindsight, the Respondent
formed the view that the owner had
successfully appealed in respect of the termite claim was because subsequent
demands for reimbursement
of monies were made by the Applicant in the respective
amounts of $1,700, $2,924 and $24,260. For the reasons I set out below, these
demands for payment bore no relationship to the termite claim. I also note that
the claim by the applicant for $1,700 (the first
of such claims) was not made
until 3 January 1996. Prior to that date the Applicant had made it clear that
the appeal in regard
to the termite claim was "the owner’s appeal" (see
letter dated 4 December 1995 from the Applicant to the Respondent).
The Other Claims by Dodd
12. (a) Claim number 73984 relating to the amount of $1,700 and
$2,924 arose as a result of the decision notified to the Respondent
Applicant’s letter dated 4 September 1995 to accept Mr Dodd’s claim
in respect of "water penetration to family
room roof window". There is no
evidence that the Respondent appealed against the decision not-withstanding his
contention to the
contrary in paragraph 9 of his letter to the Domestic Building
Tribunal dated 3 March 1997. Given that the works had not been rectified
Respondent by 29 September 1995 the Respondent was notified by the
Applicant’s letter dated 5 October 1995 that quotations
would therefore be
obtained by Mr Dodd for the carrying out of the works on the Respondent’s
behalf. By letter dated 3 January
1996 the Applicant advised the Respondent that
it had approved payment in the sum of $1,700 in this regard. By further letter
8 March 1996 the Applicant advised the Respondent that the Applicant had
approved the further payment of $2,924 for accommodation,
storage and removal
costs incurred by Mr Dodd during the rectification period. Whilst it is unclear
to me why it was necessary for
Mr Dodd to incur such expenses during the
carrying out of the relevant works (perhaps the Applicant intended this letter
to claim 76307) nevertheless, the amount is therefore unrelated to the
termite claim.
(b) Claim 76307 relating to the amount of $24,260 arose as a
result of the decision notified to the Respondent by the Applicant’s
letter dated 13 September 1995 to accept Mr Dodd’s further claim in
respect of a defective concrete slab in front of the building.
Again there is
no evidence that the Respondent appealed against this decision notwithstanding
his contention to the contrary in
paragraph 9 of his letter to the Domestic
Building Tribunal dated 3 March 1997. Given that these works had not been
completed by
the Respondent by 10 October 1995 the Respondent was notified by
the Applicant’s letter dated 4 October 1995 that quotations
obtained by Mr Dodd for the carrying out of the works on the Respondent’s
behalf. By letter dated 22 December 1995
the Applicant advised the Respondent
that it had approved payment of $24,260 in this regard. This amount is
therefore not relevant
to the termite claim.
13. I therefore reject the submission made in paragraph 7 of the
Respondent’s affidavit that the Applicant has chosen to proceed
the sums of $1,700, $2,924 and $24,260 from the Respondent notwithstanding that
the Respondent had an appeal on foot in
respect of the termite claim. I find
that no appeal was made by the Respondent in regard to the termite claim and for
that for the
reasons set out above these sums, in any event, do not relate to
the termite claim but to other claims by Mr Dodd.
14. It follows that there is nothing in the material before me which proves
that the Applicant’s decision to proceed to recover
the sums of $1,700,
$2,924 and $24,260 from the Respondent was made other than in a bona fide
15. Submissions were made by Mr Laird on the question of interest and costs.
Whilst it was put to me by Mr Laird that the Applicant
may be entitled to
indemnity costs (see
HGFL v Miloma Developments Pty
Court of Victoria, Appeal Division, 6 December 1994, unreported) costs on scale
"D" only were sought. Having considered
these submissions, I have made the
orders published herewith.
