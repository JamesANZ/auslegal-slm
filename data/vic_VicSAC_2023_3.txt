Combined Orders of Imprisonment with a Community Correction Order in Victoria [2023] VicSAC 3; (14 November 2023)
Combined Orders of Imprisonment with a Community Correction Order in
When sentencing someone
for criminal offending, courts can select from a number of possible sentencing
orders, such as imprisonment,
a drug and alcohol treatment order, a community
correction order (CCO), a fine, an adjourned undertaking, or a dismissal with or
without conviction.
Courts can also
often impose a combination of these sentencing orders if doing so would be
appropriate in the circumstances of the
The focus of this report is a
particular combination of sentencing orders imposed in the same case:
imprisonment with a CCO (a
combined order
). A CCO is a sentencing order
that an offender serves in the community while subject to various mandatory
conditions as well as at
least one optional
When courts impose a
combined order, the offender commences their CCO on release from prison.
Aim and research questions
The aim of this report is
to present a statistical profile of combined orders of imprisonment with a CCO
in the 9 calendar years from
This is an important topic of
study for a number of reasons.
First, as the data in this report illustrates, combined orders have become
very common, and it is important to understand whether
the CCO and/or the
imprisonment components of combined orders are functionally different from
straight CCOs
or straight
imprisonment
and what the
implications of any differences might be. Most of our previous examinations of
CCOs have been where a CCO was the most
serious penalty in the
Second, examining combined orders helps to identify the true number of people
who receive CCOs each year, and the workload that CCOs
represent for Corrections
Victoria, which is responsible for supervising, assisting and monitoring people
subject to a CCO.
Sentencing data
is often presented using a counting rule based on the
principal sentence
where only one sentence type is counted per case, that being the most severe
sentence imposed according to Victoria’s sentencing
Because imprisonment is
more severe than a CCO, that counting rule excludes CCOs in cases where
imprisonment (or a suspended sentence
of imprisonment) has also been imposed.
One of the hypotheses we sought to test in this report – in light of the
greater number
of prison sentences imposed in recent years and an apparent
concurrent decrease in CCOs
– was whether these changes are due to an increase in combined orders that
has obscured the true prevalence of CCOs.
Third, there has been a series of legislative reforms since the introduction
of CCOs in 2012. In 2014, the maximum additional prison
term (on top of time
already spent on remand) that could be imposed as part of a combined order was
increased from 3 months to 2
And in 2017, the maximum
additional prison term was reduced from 2 years to 1
A time series analysis of
the imprisonment lengths in combined orders can indicate whether those reforms
have had their intended
In that context, this report answers the following research questions about

Prevalence of combined orders
From 2012 to 2020, there
were 18,144 combined orders imposed in Victoria: 16,274 in the
Magistrates’ Court and 1,870 in the
In both jurisdictions,
there has been a significant increase in the number of combined orders since
2012, especially in the Magistrates’
Court (Figure 1). The spike in 2015
in both jurisdictions is most likely due to the increase in the maximum
additional prison term
(from 3 months to 2 years) in 2014 as well as courts
responding with enthusiasm to the Court of Appeal’s 2014 guideline
calling for increased use of
The drop in 2020 is very
much due to the reduced number of cases finalised while court operations were
affected by COVID-19.

Magistrates' Court
The most common Magistrates’ Court locations at which combined orders
were imposed were Melbourne (3,156 combined orders), Dandenong
(1,497 combined
orders) and Sunshine (1,463 combined orders). These numbers are broadly
consistent with the volume of cases dealt
with at those court locations more
Age and gender of people who received combined orders
combined orders were imposed on males
Of the 16,274 combined orders imposed in the Magistrates’ Court, 90.1%
were imposed on males (14,669 combined orders), and 9.9%
were imposed on females
(1,605 combined orders). These percentages were relatively consistent throughout
the reference period, with
males receiving between 88.7% and 91.2% of combined
orders each year between 2012 and 2020.
The age of offenders who received a combined order was available in 16,253
cases in the Magistrates’ Court (age was not available
in 21 cases). In
these 16,253 cases, ages ranged from 17 (1 case) to 81 (1 case), with a median
age of 32 (Figure 2). The most common
age was 28, accounting for 714 combined
orders (4.4%). There was little variation in the age of offenders who received
combined orders
during the reference period, though there was a slight increase
in the median age, from 31 to 32 for the first 6 years and then to
last three years.

Magistrates’ Court, 2012 to 2020 (16,253 cases)
Number of cases
The age and gender of offenders who received combined orders in the higher
courts were much the same. About 88% were male (1,647 of
1,870 offenders), and
the median age was 31, ranging from 18 (6 cases) to 74 (1 case), 83 (1 case) and
84 (1 case).
Offence types in combined order cases
An ANZSOC offence
was recorded for 16,180

Magistrates’ Court where a principal offence was identifiable. By far the
most common offence type in these cases was
assault and injury
accounting for more
than one-third of combined order cases (35.6% or 5,763 cases). This was followed
by drug-related offences
or 1,947 cases), burglary
(9.7% or 1,566 cases)
and endangerment offences
or 1,225 cases). Figure 3 (page 6) shows the 20 most common principal offences
in combined order cases in the Magistrates’
Court. Six offences were
noticeably more prominent than others: unlawful assault (10.7% of
recklessly causing
injury (9.8%),
trafficking in a
non-commercial quantity of methylamphetamine
possessing a controlled
weapon (4.4%)
and intentionally
causing injury (3.7%).
these are violent offences.

In the higher courts, an ANZSOC offence type was recorded for 1,869 combined

The most common
offence types were robbery
(23.0% or 429 cases),
assault and injury offences
(20.4% or 381 cases), drug-related offences (12.5% or 233 cases), burglary
(9.9% or 185 cases) and
sex offences
(9.1% or 170
The five most common
principal offences were all violent or robbery offences: armed robbery (287
cases), intentionally causing injury
(136), recklessly causing serious injury
(92), attempted armed robbery (61) and recklessly causing injury (59).
As to the prevalence of family violence offending in combined order cases
(from 2016 to 2020),
combined orders were imposed in cases with a family violence indicator (5,093 of
12,202 cases). By way of comparison, just
15.2% of all cases in the
Magistrates’ Court in the same 5 years had a family violence indicator.
Violent offending was especially

The imprisonment component of combined orders
The analysis in this
section focuses on the imprisonment component of combined orders. It assesses
the extent to which the recent
increase in prison sentences has been driven by
an increase in combined orders (as opposed to straight imprisonment), the
imprisonment
lengths in combined orders, the rate of time served prison
sentences in combined orders, and the proportion of imprisonment components
combined orders that were spent on remand as opposed to being served after
sentencing.
How much of the recent increase in imprisonment is constituted
by combined orders?
The total number of prison sentences imposed in the
Magistrates’ Court each year more than doubled between 2012 and 2020, from
4,069 to 8,640 (from 4.8% of all sentencing outcomes to 17.9%). There was also
an increase in prison sentences imposed in the higher
courts, albeit less
pronounced, from 1,073 to 1,163 (from 55.6% of all sentencing outcomes to
It seems that in both jurisdictions the increased use of combined orders
played a significant role in that increase in prison sentences.
As shown in
Figure 4, in 2012 just 9.5% of all prison sentences imposed in the
Magistrates’ Court were combined orders (386
of 4,069 prison sentences),
and the proportion was 2.8% in the higher courts (30 of 1,073 prison sentences).
Combined orders as a
proportion of prison sentences peaked in both jurisdictions
in 2015 at just under one-third in the Magistrates’ Court (32.3%
of 6,283 prison sentences) and over one-third in the higher courts (36.0% or 399
of 1,109 prison sentences). These proportions
have decreased slightly since then
– to 27.1% in the Magistrates’ Court and 21.8% in the higher courts
but they are still much higher than in earlier years.

What were the imprisonment lengths in combined orders?
Turning next to the imprisonment lengths in combined
orders, we provide a brief review of legislative reforms to contextualise the
data. When CCOs were first introduced in January 2012, the maximum additional
prison term that could be imposed in a combined order
(on top of time already
spent on remand) was 3 months.
Less than 3 years later, that was increased to 2
in order ‘[t]o

years after that, it was reduced to 1

That occurred, they
said, because of an awkward interplay between CCOs and non-parole periods in
certain cases. Courts are required
to declare a non-parole period when imposing
imprisonment of 2 years or more.
They are allowed to impose a CCO with imprisonment of 2 years or more via
section 44 if enough time has been spent on

prohibited from imposing a combined order and a non-parole period in the same
Taken together, these
provisions would seem to suggest that courts that want to impose a combined
order of imprisonment with a CCO
are (in certain cases) simultaneously required
to impose, but also prohibited from imposing, a non-parole period. The Supreme
resolved the issue in 2020, clarifying that courts are ‘prohibited
from fixing a non-parole period’ if they impose a
combined order and the
total imprisonment length is in excess of 2

months (16 January 2012 to 28 September 2014), 2 years (29 September 2014 to
March 2017), 1 year (20 March 2017 to present day)
With that context in mind, Figure 5 shows the distribution of
imprisonment lengths (that is, time spent on remand plus remaining time to
serve) in combined order cases in the Magistrates’
Court from 2012 to
2020. There was a clear change in 2014 and 2015, with imprisonment lengths in
combined orders getting much longer.
Whereas in 2013 just 15.8% of imprisonment
lengths in combined order cases were longer than 3 months, by 2015 that
percentage had
tripled to 48.4%. This suggests that the increase in the maximum
additional prison term in 2014 had the intended effect of enabling
imposition of combined orders in a much broader array of cases. The 2017 reform,
however, of reducing the maximum additional
prison term from 2 years to 1 year,
does not seem to have had much effect in the Magistrates’ Court. This is
most likely because
even when 2-year imprisonment lengths were available in
combined order cases, there were very few cases where an imprisonment length
excess of 12 months was imposed in the Magistrates’ Court as part of a
combined order (1.4% of all combined order cases
or 224 cases), with the longest
being 4 years (1 case), 2.5 years (1 case) and 2 years (10 cases).

Court, by imprisonment length, 2012 to 2020 (16,274 cases)

In comparison, it seems that
the 2014 reform and the 2017 reform
had significant effects in the higher courts. While the majority of imprisonment
components of
combined orders were 3 months or less in 2012 (86.7%) and 2013
(62.9%), those had dropped to 21.9% in 2014 and 9.5% in 2015 (Figure
Instead, since 2014 the majority of imprisonment lengths in combined orders in
the higher courts have been longer than 6 months.
There were also 2 years
– 2015 (40.1% ) and 2016 (40.6%) – when imprisonment lengths in
excess of 12 months were especially
prevalent. These were the same 2 full years
in which the maximum additional prison term that could be imposed in a combined
was 2 years rather than 1 year. In essence, the data suggests that both of
the legislative reforms – extending the maximum
additional prison term
from 3 months to 2 years in 2014 and then reducing it to 1 year in 2017 –
had their intended effects.
As to the Court of Appeal’s observation in
2016 about a ‘spate’ of 23-month prison
there were indeed 17
such sentences in 2015 and another 14 in 2016, but only 4 or less every other

How many combined orders involved time served prison sentences?
In 2020, we released a report examining time served
prison sentences, which involve an offender receiving a prison sentence
to the amount of time that they have spent on remand. In that report,
we found that time served prison sentences had quadrupled from
5% to 20% of all
prison sentences in Victoria in the 6 years to 2017–18. We further
observed that:
there may be
circumstances where the interests of justice require the court to impose a
sentence that accounts for the time that the
offender has spent on remand, even
if the court would otherwise not have imposed a prison sentence if the offender
had not been remanded
in the first place;
time served
prison sentences can sometimes reflect the remand experience causing an
inappropriate encouragement of guilty pleas, insofar
as the offender may have
had a plausible defence available to them but they pleaded guilty to facilitate
their earlier release from
restrictions around the types of programs and services that can be provided to
people who are held on remand compared to
sentenced prisoners, because the
latter have been found guilty and have a more fixed end point to their stay in
prison (or point
of eligibility for parole); and
concerns around the availability of transition assistance for offenders who
receive time served prison sentences, especially
if their release after
sentencing is not anticipated.
Building on that analysis, it is
useful to specifically examine how many combined orders involved time served
prison sentences. They
may reflect cases where the court acknowledges the
punitive experience of time spent on remand by imposing a time served prison
but also sees a need for some form of ongoing supervision or
rehabilitation that could be facilitated by the additional imposition
For the higher courts, we had data on pre-sentence detention for the entire
reference period, but for the Magistrates’ Court,
we only had data on
pre-sentence detention for the period 1 July 2016 onwards. The analysis for the
Magistrates’ Court in this
section is therefore limited to a shorter
reference period (4.5 years).
There were 11,036 combined orders imposed in the Magistrates’ Court
during that 4.5-year period and 1,870 in the higher courts
during the whole
9-year reference period. Figure 7 (page 13) shows how many of those combined
order cases involved time served prison
sentences. To allow for calculation
errors, we considered a sentence to be a time served prison sentence if the
total effective sentence
of imprisonment and pre-sentence detention were the
same plus or minus 5 days (0.17 months). In the Magistrates’ Court, there
was a clear increase in the proportion of combined order cases that involved
time served prison sentences, from 37.7% to 48.8%. By
2020, about half of all
combined order cases in the Magistrates’ Court involved time served prison
sentences. Conversely, there
was a less noticeable increase in time served
prison sentences in the higher courts, though they did increase slightly from
in 2016 to 24.4% in 2020.

offenders had at least some
pre-sentence detention declared, meaning that they
had spent some time on remand – and conversely, 18% of people who received
combined orders in the higher courts had not spent time on remand prior to
sentencing. Across the 1,870 cases, there was a total
of 1,625 years of
imprisonment imposed. There was also a total of 875 years declared as
pre-sentence detention in those cases (Figure
8), meaning that just over half of
sentenced prison terms in combined orders in the higher courts (53.8%) had
already been served
on remand prior to sentencing.

Remaining time to serve
The situation in the Magistrates’ Court is very similar. There were
11,036 combined orders imposed in the Magistrates’
Court between July 2016
and December 2020. Of those, 10,040 offenders had spent at least some time on
remand. Conversely, this means
that just 9% of offenders who received a combined
order in the Magistrates’ Court had not spent any time on remand prior to
sentencing. Across the 11,036 cases, courts ordered 3,473 years of imprisonment.
They also declared 2,078 years of pre-sentence detention,
meaning that 59.8% of
prison terms in combined orders in the Magistrates’ Court had already been
served prior to sentencing.

How much prison time in combined orders was still to be served

offender was required to serve in the 11,036 combined order cases from July 2016
December 2020 in the Magistrates’ Court and the 1,870 combined order
cases from 2012 to 2020 in the higher courts. In the Magistrates’
55.0% of combined order cases involved no additional prison term (6,072 cases),
and just 3.9% required an additional prison
term of 6 months or more. In the
higher courts, longer additional prison terms were more common. While almost
half of combined order
cases required no additional prison term after sentencing
(48.2%), just over one-fifth required an additional prison term of 6 months
more (21.3%).

A potential issue arises here – in particular, how much additional
prison time a court can order when imprisonment and a CCO
are imposed on
separate offences in the same case. When courts impose
imprisonment
on the same offence (or offences) in a case, section
Sentencing Act
clearly allows them to impose up to an additional 12 months’
imprisonment (on top of time spent on
) that the offender must
serve before the CCO commences.
There are, though, many cases where courts impose imprisonment and a CCO
separately on different offences in the
When this occurs, there
are two plausible and competing interpretations of section 44 (see Table 1): if
section 44 applies, courts
can impose an additional 12 months’
imprisonment; if it doesn’t apply, section 38(2) restricts the maximum
prison term to just 3
The reason there are
plausible and competing interpretations of section 44 is that the language of
the provision alternates between
charge-specific language (‘the
offence’) and case-specific language (‘when sentencing an
offender’ and ‘the
sum of all the terms of imprisonment’). If
the focus of the provision is charge-specific, then section 44 does not apply
imprisonment and a CCO are imposed separately. But if the provision is
case-specific, then section 44 does apply.

can serve to 3 months.
That case involved a category 2 offence (home invasion), for which courts cannot
impose a combined order.
court concluded that imposing a prison sentence on the category 2 offence and a
CCO on other offences was allowed (despite section
5(2H)) but would limit the
maximum additional prison term to 3 months (because section 44 did not apply).
On the other hand, there
were also 277 cases in the 4.5 years to December 2020
in which the Magistrates’ Court imposed an additional prison term of
or more despite imposing
imprisonment and a CCO on separate
suggesting section 44
apply in those cases.
Subsequently, the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment on appeal from the
County Court decision in
In that new
judgment, the Court of Appeal overturned the County Court’s reasoning. The
Court of Appeal concluded that (a) the
section 5(2H) limitation on combined
orders for category 2 offences operates at the charge level, such that a court
can nevertheless
impose a CCO on other offences in the case, and also that (b)
the section 44 lifting of the maximum additional prison time after
from 3 months to 12 months has case-level application, regardless of whether
there is a category 2 offence in the case
(so long as there is also at least one
offence on which to impose the
In other words, in all
cases where imprisonment and a CCO are imposed – whether together on the
same charge, together on multiple
charges or separately on different charges
– section 44 operates to enable an additional 12 months’
imprisonment after
sentencing.
The CCO component of combined orders
Having examined the data
relating to the imprisonment component of combined orders, we now present an
analysis of data relating to
the CCO component. This includes an examination of
how many ‘hidden’
are imposed in combined
orders each year and the conditions attached to CCOs in combined order cases.
Has there actually been a decrease in CCOs in recent years?
A count of principal sentences would suggest that
there has been a 20% decline in the number of CCOs imposed in recent years, from
a peak of 10,508 in 2015 to 8,432 in 2019 (the effect of COVID-19 on court
operations means that 2020 is not a useful comparator).
CCOs are not, however,
always the principal sentence. In a combined order case, imprisonment is the
principal sentence. Sometimes,
too, wholly and partially suspended sentences of
imprisonment (which have now been abolished) can also be imposed alongside a
and they were especially back in 2012. Once those ‘hidden’ CCOs
are accounted for, there was a more modest 11.5% decline
in the number of CCOs
imposed in the Magistrates’ Court in that same timeframe, from 12,560 in
2015 to 11,117 in 2019.

Magistrates’ Court, 2012 to 2020 (90,617 CCOs)
CCO - principal sentence
CCO with suspended sentence
CCO with imprisonment (combined order)
The number of ‘hidden’ CCOs is even more stark in the higher
courts (Figure 12, page 19). More than half (52.9%) of all
CCOs in the higher
courts between 2015 and 2020 were imposed alongside a more severe sentence
(1,700 with imprisonment and 91 with
a wholly or partially suspended sentence of
imprisonment) and would not be represented in a count of principal sentences.

courts, 2012 to 2020 (4,463 CCOs)

CCO with imprisonment (combined order)
Taken together, these findings highlight the true prevalence of CCOs in
Victoria. From January 2012 (when CCOs first came into effect)
to December 2020
(the end of our reference period), there were 95,080 cases in Victoria in which
a CCO was imposed.
Conditions of CCOs in combined orders
Sentencing Act
specifies a number of
mandatory and optional conditions for
One of the optional
conditions is unpaid community work, which the Court of Appeal has described as
‘the punitive element’
of a community order, while also noting that
all aspects of a CCO can be punitive when they curtail
We sought to identify
whether CCOs in combined orders have a lower rate of unpaid community work
conditions. This could reflect the
prison sentence in those cases being the
primary ‘punitive element’ of the
and priority being
given to conditions of CCOs that are geared more towards rehabilitation and
protection of the community (therapeutic
and supervisory conditions)
The data shows that there was indeed only
condition that was less
common in combined order CCOs than in straight CCOs, and it was unpaid community
work (40.3% of combined order

Concluding remarks
This report has
presented a statistical profile of cases in which an offender received a
combined order of imprisonment with a CCO.
The key findings include:
there has been a
significant increase in the number of combined orders imposed, especially in the
Magistrates’ Court, with almost
3,000 combined orders imposed in 2019
(prior to COVID-19 affecting court operations);
majority of combined orders were imposed on males (90.1%), and the median age of
people who received combined orders was
the most common
offence type in combined order cases in the Magistrates’ Court was an
assault and injury offence (35.6%), such
as unlawful assault and recklessly
causing injury, and in the higher courts it was robbery offences (23.0%);
combined orders in the Magistrates’ Court were imposed in cases with a
family violence indicator;
the majority of
prison terms in combined orders were spent on remand (59.8% in the
Magistrates’ Court and 53.8% in the higher
the offender
still had to serve additional prison time of 6 months or more in 3.9% of
combined order cases in the Magistrates’
Court and 21.3% of combined order
cases in the higher courts;
a significant
proportion of combined order cases involve time served prison sentences,
especially in the Magistrates’ Court
(by 2020, 48.8% of combined order
cases involved time served prison sentences in the Magistrates’ Court and
24.4% in the higher
95,080 CCOs imposed in Victoria from 2012 to 2020, and 18,144 (19.1%) were
imposed as part of a combined order with imprisonment;
the conditions
of combined order CCOs differ markedly from conditions of straight CCOs: unpaid
community work was much more commonly
imposed in straight CCOs (73.7% compared
to 40.3%) whereas all other conditions were more common in combined order CCOs.
At the outset, we set out to examine the true prevalence of CCOs
and whether it might be obscured by the oft-employed counting rule
based on the
principal sentence (which only counts the most serious sentence type in each
case). Between 2015 and 2020, half of all
CCOs in the higher courts (50.2%) and
one-fifth of CCOs in the Magistrates’ Court (21.3%) were imposed alongside
imprisonment.
In 2019 alone, this amounts to almost 3,000 ‘hidden’
CCOs, which have significant resource implications for the justice
facilitating and supervising these orders.
We also sought to determine whether there were substantive differences
between combined order CCOs and straight CCOs. The differences
in the conditions
imposed on these two groups were marked. While courts appropriately acknowledge
that all conditions of CCOs can
operate in a punitive fashion, it is the unpaid
community work condition that clearly tends to fall away in CCOs in combined
and instead courts prioritise conditions that are geared towards
facilitating the offender’s rehabilitation once they leave
assessment and treatment, Corrections supervision and judicial monitoring. There
are most likely a number of reasons for
this. For one, the experience of
incarceration possibly militates against the need for a community work condition
to operate as a
form of punishment. For another, people who are held on remand,
or those who commit offending serious enough to warrant a prison
term, are more
likely to have complex needs that require an additional focus on rehabilitation
and supervision in the conditions
of their CCO.
We also sought to understand the effect of the 2014 and 2017 legislative
reforms to CCOs, first increasing the maximum additional
prison term after
sentencing from 3 months to 2 years, and then reducing it from 2 years to 1
year. It seems both reforms had their
intended effect. The number of combined
orders did significantly increase in 2015, though this was likely also due to
the Court of
Appeal’s 2014 guideline judgment in
. There was
also a significant increase in imprisonment lengths in combined orders,
suggesting that the increased maximum additional
prison term at least partly
contributed to the increase in combined orders. Further, while the 2017 reform
does not appear to have
had much effect in the Magistrates’ Court –
where prison sentences in excess of 12 months are rare – the imprisonment
component of combined orders in the higher courts became much shorter in 2017.
In essence, both of those reforms appear to have achieved
their intended effect
of first expanding and then contracting the availability and use of combined

time the offender has spent on remand before sentence. Instead, for the purposes
of the applicable
ceiling of imprisonment specified in the concluding words of

of the consequences of imposing imprisonment and a CCO on separate offences is
that if an offender breaches the CCO after release
from prison and is to be

other offences untouched:

plausible possibility does not seem to have been

imprisonment in its guideline judgment in
Boulton & Ors v The Queen

[I]mprisonment is uniquely
punitive because of that feature which distinguishes it from all other forms of
sanction, namely, the
complete loss of liberty. But imprisonment has a number of
other punitive features, apart from the loss of physical freedom. There
loss of personal autonomy and of privacy, and the associated loss of control
over choice of activities and choice of associates.
The prisoner is subject to
strict discipline, restriction of movement, forced association with other
prisoners and — for a
substantial part of each day — confinement in
a small cell (in many instances, a cell shared with a cellmate not of the
choosing). There is, moreover, exposure to the risks associated
with the confinement of large numbers of people in a small space
