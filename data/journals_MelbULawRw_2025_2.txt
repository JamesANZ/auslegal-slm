Scholars have highlighted the advantages and risks of transnational
regulatory networks for domestic lawmaking. This article examines
Australia’s adoption of the Financial Action Task Force
(‘FATF’) anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing
standards. Existing scholarship characterises the FATF as a coercive regime that
dictates policy and empowers the executive to implement
non-binding
transnational standards into domestic law without legislative oversight, thereby
precluding democratic participation
and contestation. To address such critiques,
we analyse the effects of the FATF’s peer reviews on domestic legislative
deliberation
by examining the contributions to a parliamentary inquiry
concerning money laundering from government departments and agencies,
representatives
of regulated entities and professional and civil society actors.
Our analysis demonstrates that the FATF’s peer review reports
prompted and facilitated, rather than supplanted, local deliberation by
providing law reformers with richer evidence and arguments
and their potential effects.

However, the making of standards by transnational networks is not subject to
ordinary domestic legislative and public law processes
and has been criticised
for its lack of transparency, lack of public accountability and its potential to
subvert democratic lawmaking,

mechanisms of such networks.
Further, in the absence of local input by affected stakeholders, there is no

This article analyses the interaction between transnational standards and
domestic lawmaking in Australia by focusing on the Financial
Action Task Force

Given the foregoing concerns and the growing importance of anti-money
laundering in the local context, in this article we probe this
point further. We
argue that the coercive compliance critique presents a limited picture of the
FATF, Australia’s role within
the FATF and the domestic deliberative,
consultative and legislative processes that bear on AML/CTF
regulation.
Specifically, we
wish to uncover the role that the FATF’s peer review mechanism has played
in triggering domestic contestation
concerning law reform and providing the
evidence and arguments that are deployed by reformers in the legislature,
private sector
and civil society.
Our analysis reveals several unique and potentially promising aspects of the
FATF regime. First, the coercive compliance critique
presents the FATF as a
quasi-legislative body that imposes its desired policies on often unwilling and
disempowered domestic legislators
It emphasises the
importance of the 40 Recommendations and the FATF’s capacity to place
economic and reputational pressure
on noncompliant jurisdictions (with peer
review used as a surveillance tool to reveal noncompliance and trigger
sanctions).
By contrast, in Part
II we explore the experimentalist literature concerning the FATF that draws
attention to its participatory,
multi-level decision-making processes, the
autonomy granted to domestic policymakers and the centrality of peer review in
facilitating
ongoing mutual learning at transnational and domestic

regulatory officials as rule-makers and promoters within

public. Instead, the FATF’s detailed peer evaluations of Australia’s

THE FATF FRAMEWORK AND AUSTRALIA’S ROLE

global standards to control money laundering, terrorism

and proliferation financing (since

and as an antidote to concerns about its effect on democratic
lawmaking in
Australia, this Part provides a general overview of the FATF framework. We
highlight the autonomy that the framework
grants to local actors and the
centrality of peer review as a tool for inciting domestic deliberation about law
reform. Further,
we will explore how Australian governments and regulatory
agencies have actively shaped the FATF framework’s norms and policies.
This provides important background for the analysis of the processes of
lawmaking in Australia concerning AML/CTF discussed in the
following Part.
The FATF: An Overview

the G7 members due to concerns about the global drug trade

developing its public listing mechanism for jurisdictions with deficient local

FATF’s remit was expanded following the terrorist attacks of 11 September
2001 to include the financing of terrorism and
was expanded again in 2012 to
include the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction.
Notwithstanding that expansion, the FATF remains an informal network with no
binding legal authority: it operates under a ‘mandate’

fact that listing a jurisdiction is seen as undesirable by the FATF itself
provides a compelling explanation for the abandonment
of the initial blacklist
of 2000–06: while that blacklist was apparently effective in securing
shallow compliance, it did not
serve the FATF’s overall goal, which is to
encourage deeper engagement and proactive policy reform to substantively address
problems of money laundering and terrorism
This perceived
undesirability also explains the FATF’s extensive engagement with
both prior to listing and when they
are on the grey list, which seeks to encourage the design of effective local
AML/CTF policies.
This section has emphasised that rather than being a top-down
quasi-legislative body that dictates policies (under the guise of
recommendations)
and coercively ensures compliance, the FATF, through its peer
reviews, encourages proactive engagement in processes of experimentation,
learning from experience and ongoing reform; public listing operates as a
background penalty default. Whether the FATF lives up to
that ambition depends
on how domestic processes of consultation, deliberation and legislation are
informed and shaped by MERs (which
will be discussed in Part III). It also
depends on the extent to which FATF members can use their own experiences and
policies to
influence the FATF framework itself — an issue to which we

regulatory authorities, industry and civil society stakeholders
have played in
the transnational FATF regime. We examine the extent to which Australian actors
participate in shaping the FATF framework

reflects Australian policy preferences. We argue that an exclusive focus on the
implementation of
FATF standards in Australia can obscure the more complex and
reciprocal interactions between Australian domestic choices and interests
the FATF’s transnational framework. If Australian governments, agencies
and other stakeholders have a significant influence
in shaping the FATF
framework, this may attenuate concerns about Australia’s eventual
compliance with FATF standards.
One obvious way in which Australia has influenced the FATF regime is, as a
founding member, by having been an early proponent of,
and exemplar for, global
policy responses to the problem of money laundering. Domestically, Australian
governments had identified
the goal of addressing money laundering prior to the
1989 establishment of the FATF through royal commissions in the
and in the enactment of
legislative reforms to counter money laundering in
When the FATF was
convened, Australia was one of the eight non-G7 jurisdictions invited to
participate and Australian delegates played
a role in shaping the initial
recommendations.
In particular, Australian legislation informed specific recommendations of the
FATF and was referred to several times in the FATF’s

This change in the FATF’s assessment of Australia, from early praise to
more recent critique, reflects various dynamics including
increasing autonomy and capacity to critique even its founding members, a
possible broader de-alignment of Australia

It follows that Australia has been involved extensively in the design and
promulgation of the FATF regime not as a passive rule-taker
but as an active
rule-maker and promoter both regionally and globally. This suggests the
existence of a considerably more reciprocal
relationship between the FATF and
Australia that is not captured by the existing literature. As such,
Australia’s relationship
with the FATF is different from that of smaller,
less-developed non-member jurisdictions. For such jurisdictions, an absence of
enforcement experience, lack of representation in FATF Plenary and
greater dependence on global financial markets create a much greater
asymmetrical imposition of FATF policies regardless of respective domestic
interests and policy
preferences.
THE FATF IN AUSTRALIA: DOMESTIC DELIBERATION
AND PARLIAMENTARY
The preceding Part presents the FATF as a global standards regime that leaves
individual jurisdictions the freedom to design local
measures and encourages
mutual learning through peer evaluation and the penalty default of listing
within which Australia —
through its executive — has played an
influential role. While this paints a more participative and less coercive
the FATF, it does not address the central concern of the coercive
compliance critique: that the FATF undermines the role of the domestic
legislature
by empowering the executive to incorporate the FATF’s
desired policies without ordinary parliamentary processes and
consultation.
To address this concern, we analyse the role of the FATF recommendations and
peer reviews in informing domestic contestation about,
and the tailoring of,
AML/CTF policies. We investigate the FATF’s influence on Australian
legislative and deliberative processes,
including the roles of the executive,
legislature and other stakeholders, with respect to AML/CTF law and how such
actors use or
contest FATF recommendations and peer reviews. Part III(A) shows
that Australian AML/CTF law has generally been made through ordinary
legislative
processes with extensive consultation of the private sector and civil society
and without extraordinary delegation of
lawmaking power to the executive to
directly incorporate FATF norms into domestic law. Given that finding, Part
III(B) analyses the
quality of parliamentary deliberation and consultation in
the most recent 2021–22 Senate Inquiry into the adequacy of
Australia’s
AML/CTF regime based on a qualitative textual analysis of all
submissions, hearings transcripts and the Senate inquiry report.
We show that the FATF’s peer reviews have prompted and informed
domestic deliberative processes to design Australia’s
AML/CTF policy
responses without dictating outcomes or preventing the incorporation of domestic
circumstances and concerns. Specifically,
we show that the executive has not
simply downloaded FATF standards or recommendations into domestic law. Instead,
it has been legislators

civil society, who have been the strongest advocates for reform; they often

and terrorism financing goes as follows: rules that reflect
FATF standards are
adopted by the executive, acting through government departments and regulatory
agencies (such as the Australian
Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre
(‘AUSTRAC’)), without regard to domestic policy preferences, for
example through
delegated legislation, rather than through ordinary processes of
parliamentary scrutiny and
But as we show, major AML/CTF policy reforms in Australia have primarily
taken place through changes to legislation made via ordinary
legislative
procedures and attended by substantial parliamentary inquiries and public
consultation. For example, the most significant
reform to Australia’s
AML/CTF policy in recent decades was the new legislative scheme set out in the

days of public hearings and recommended further

throughout the 2015 MER as having detracted from its effective

Tranche two was also
raised in parliamentary debates concerning the 2017 and 2020 amendments to the
AML/CTF Act
with the Greens even seeking, unsuccessfully, to add those
reforms to the 2020 Bill.
With respect to the substantive risks posed by DNFBPs, FATF’s 2015 MER
argued that unregulated DNFBPs contribute to AML/CTF
risks in Australia by
referring to domestic evidence from AUSTRAC’s (classified) 2011 National
Threat Assessment concerning

stated that lawyers and accountants could facilitate the establishment of legal

money laundering and also pointed to

By early 2022, after the Senate had referred an inquiry concerning the
‘adequacy and effectiveness’ of Australia’s
AML/CTF regime to
the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee
(‘Committee’) in June 2021, tranche
two was a central focus for
potential AML/CTF law reform.
Specifically, the terms of reference for the Committee instructed it to inquire
into the regulatory impact, costs and benefits of
tranche two reforms, the
extent to which tranche two professions contribute to AML/CTF risks and the
compatibility of possible AML/CTF
reporting obligations with professional
obligations.
The terms of
reference also included general questions to be answered about the effectiveness
of Australia’s AML/CTF regime,

As such, diverse stakeholders were consulted and were given an opportunity to be
heard in the inquiry. In the following sections,

the Committee) to reveal
the diversity of views on tranche two by reference to
domestic concerns and their more granular alignment with the FATF framework.

evidence across different participants and to trace
the influence of the FATF
recommendations and MERs, vis-a-vis other considerations, on the outcome of the
inquiry. This analysis
reveals a substantive deliberation process about
available AML/CTF law reform options and a complex relationship between the
the executive, Parliament, the private sector and civil society: these
findings may attenuate the concerns expressed in the literature
Compliance Professionals
Notably, the first set of committee hearings was dedicated to evidence given
by AML compliance professionals, an emerging profession
that provides services
to the private and public sectors to design and implement compliance systems for
their legal obligations and
to address money laundering and terrorism financing
These witnesses strongly advocated for the need for Australia to comply with the
FATF framework as

Anthony Quinn, Founder/Director of Arctic Intelligence, said in the

activities.
Society and Academics
Apart from private sector stakeholders with economic interests in the scope
of AML/CTF regulation or access to global financial markets,
the Committee heard
from several civil society groups concerned with public policy and representing
dispersed interests that included
corruption, child exploitation, civil
liberties and national security policy as well as from academics.
Civil society groups concerned with issues such as corruption (Transparency

and Real Estate Agents

unnecessary regulatory burdens

The Real Estate Institute of Australia was ambivalent with respect to tranche

businesses’.
Its representatives made no reference to the FATF recommendations or
They also emphasised
the potential compliance burden and supported a cost-benefit analysis, including
an examination of whether reporting
obligations on real estate agents would
actually catch money launderers and an audit of how existing regulation could be
to ‘provide effective alternatives to burdensome compliance
activities’.
The Law Council of Australia (‘LCA’) expressed the strongest
opposition to tranche two. It presented various arguments,
including the
incompatibility of reporting obligations with legal professional privilege, the
existing regulation of the profession,
concerns about regulatory burden and
disagreement with the view that lawyers are at high risk of being exploited for
laundering.
The LCA was familiar with the FATF framework, noting that ‘the Australian
legal profession is distinguishable from many other
FATF jurisdictions and other
DNFBPs by [virtue of its] robust safeguards built into the admission to
reference to the experience of other FATF jurisdictions, pointing out that

the LCA cited an American law journal article that contended that
‘the FATF’s evidence that lawyers contribute significantly to
global money laundering is inadequate to justify imposing
costs of billions of
US law firms’.
The most significant concern raised by the LCA was the effect of customer due
diligence and suspicious transaction reporting on legal
professional
Its supplementary submission on this point attached a statement by the
International Bar Association Presidential Task Force on Lawyer–Client

inconsistent. Although FATF explicitly recognises that the requirement for
lawyers to report their clients’ suspicious transactions
does not apply
where the information is subject to ‘privilege’, this type of
legislation has led to further troubling
exceptions to the broader protection
given by lawyer–client
confidentiality.
advancing the LCA’s strong opposition to tranche two legislation, Brasch
also envisaged that Australia had substantial autonomy
to design its laws
and indicated that the LCA’s membership would participate in the design
any such reforms: ‘we’re happy to work with government and to
our position’.
Summarising the input from the private sector and civil society, we can
observe that compliance professionals, as well as financial
institutions already
subject to regulation and requiring ongoing access to international capital
markets, provided the strongest
support for implementing tranche
While these groups
referenced the importance of disrupting money laundering, crime and terrorism,
their position was arguably consistent
with their economic interests. This
position was counterbalanced by the input of tranche two professional bodies in
accountancy,
law and real estate; these bodies expressed concerns about
regulatory burden and the potential cost of AML/CTF law reform for small
businesses. Importantly, however, these bodies emphasised the scope for
collaborative design to ensure law reform is proportionate.
In fact, from among
the three tranche two professions, only the LCA expressed strong opposition to
reporting obligations for lawyers
by reference to the importance of
lawyer–client privilege, and even on that point the LCA referred to
international experience
that Australia could draw on. While civil society
groups and academics expressed diverse views, their input brought to attention
the more dispersed and often invisible interests of victims, for example of
corruption or child exploitation, that are harmed by
AML/CTF activities. They
also highlighted, to a much greater extent than other witnesses, the fact that
meeting FATF standards should
not be an end in itself and that those standards
may not always reflect current best practice mechanisms.
The Committee also heard from representatives of the executive including the
Department of Home Affairs (‘DHA’), regulatory
agencies such as
AUSTRAC and law enforcement bodies including the AFP and the Australian Criminal
Intelligence Commission (‘ACIC’).
Significantly, these
representatives expressed only moderate support for tranche two, potentially
countering the concerns expressed
in the literature about the FATF empowering
executive actors.
FATF’s recommendations and MERs were not regarded as a central reason to
implement such reforms but rather as one factor
among many to consider in
addressing money laundering and terrorism financing.
Representatives of the DHA and AUSTRAC presented an account of the FATF and
Australia’s role in shaping its framework that aligns
with our findings in
Part II. The DHA emphasised that, as the department that led Australia’s
engagement with the FATF at the
time, it played ‘an active role in that
forum to influence any changes in standards, interpretation and criteria for
action’ which meant ‘that Australia [could] shape the
global standards in a way that [met its] domestic settings, context
interests’.
Further, AUSTRAC explained that the ‘priorities and emerging
challenges’ identified by the FATF are ‘derived from
the experiences
of its member countries’ and that engagement with the FATF ‘allows
AUSTRAC and other partner agencies
to share experiences, learn from the
experiences of others, and develop relationships and contacts for future
operational and policy
cooperation’.
The FATF’s influence was highlighted as having shaped AUSTRAC’s
analytical task of risk assessment, a diagnostic exercise
that seeks to better
understand the actual risks of money laundering both generally and with respect
to particular industries and
Further, the DHA
referred to the 2015 MER, alongside the 2016 Statutory Review, as a source of
‘recommendations to further
enhance Australia’s
and noted that
the AML/CTF regime is ‘continually reviewed to proactively manage emerging
risks, improve consistency with international
standards and best practice as set
by [the FATF], and enhance the operation[al] effectiveness of the
The DHA and AUSTRAC also pushed back against the claim that Australia is
significantly noncompliant with the FATF framework, expressing
only moderate
support for the need for tranche two. One of the DHA’s representatives
claimed that ‘Australia compares
favourably with many jurisdictions on the
assessment of the effectiveness of our regime by FATF’ although the FATF
has ‘obviously
called out the fact that tranche 2 hasn’t been
implemented’.
similarly argued against the view of Australia as significantly noncompliant
with the FATF: one of its representatives noted
that ‘[t]he Australian
regime in some areas is actually a lot stronger than the FATF
requirements’ with AUSTRAC having
access to a ‘richer dataset’
than many other financial intelligence
Ultimately, the DHA cautiously supported tranche two. In relation to the
legal profession, one of the DHA’s representatives
noted that legal
services are ‘vulnerable to abuse for money laundering’ and based
this conclusion on the evidence provided
for the profession’s inclusion in
the FATF’s recommendations as well as ‘international typologies and
international
experience’.
the DHA acknowledged the problems associated with DNFBP sectors not being under
an obligation to ‘understand their
money laundering or terrorist financing
risks [or] implement specific money laundering or terrorist financing risk
mitigation policies’.
AUSTRAC, by contrast, while acknowledging that tranche two rules might generate
more information, also noted the problem and cost
of excessive reporting
obligations: if the quality and relevance of additional reports is not ensured,
AUSTRAC could find itself
‘drowning’ in useless reports that would
require additional resourcing to
As such, AUSTRAC
denied that tranche two would transform the AML/CTF system or lead to more
investigations of tranche two
professionals.
Finally, both the DHA and AUSTRAC emphasised the importance of collaborating
and consulting with industry, underscoring Australia’s
autonomy in
designing any tranche two laws. As the DHA noted,
[a]ny expansion of the regime would need to be co-designed with industry and
ensure that an appropriate balance could be reached
between mitigating the risk
of money laundering or terrorist financing and not unnecessarily increasing the
regulatory burden on
the DHA and AUSTRAC further agreed that a collaborative approach with industry
would be necessary for effective tranche two implementation:
AUSTRAC noted that
it adopts a ‘flexible and tailored
and the DHA emphasised the importance of regulatory co-design and
‘collaboration with industry’ in designing regulations
suited to the
local context.
The representatives of law enforcement agencies indicated much stronger
support for tranche two. The AFP supported tranche two, alongside
other reforms
to strengthen AML/CTF laws, and referred to the FATF to support its
It supported expanding reporting requirements to DNFBPs to ‘harden’
these professions and ‘stop them from being

was, however, on the substantive domestic risks of organised crime and money

professions and businesses, and the AFP’s experience concerning the
vulnerability of these
sectors to money laundering; it also highlighted a
specific investigation of the use of a solicitor’s trust to conceal cash

well as the FATF, were referred to as part of a larger ‘jigsaw puzzle that

of tranche two, the AFP also referred to the FATF as providing
‘internationally accepted benchmarks for the
assessment of

The AFP noted
that its recent enforcement operations with respect to money laundering and its
development of new tools to maximise
effective criminal asset confiscation have
‘demonstrated a continued commitment to the implementation of the FATF
recommendations’.
ACIC also supported tranche two on the basis of its own domestic intelligence
on the risks of money laundering in tranche two industries
and without any
reference to the FATF.
its representatives noted that the ACIC was conducting ‘a number of
intelligence operations that [involved] professional
facilitators involved in
the laundering of the proceeds of crim[e]’ and that these facilitators had
been ‘revealed in
[its] investigations as a component in the criminal
business model’.
representative also made reference to a ‘protected submission’ to
the Committee that included detailed information
concerning the involvement of
tranche two professions in money laundering that could not be revealed
In response to the
questions that it took on notice, the ACIC submitted that approximately
one-quarter of the 185 individuals that
it identified as, at the time,
facilitating the actions of ‘16 current and/or former’ priority
target organisations engaging
in transnational crime were lawyers, financial
advisors, accountants or real estate
representative also dismissed any apparent inconsistency between the
ACIC’s statements and those of the FATF as to
whether Australia is an
attractive location for laundered money from overseas or merely a source of
money to be laundered —
he noted: ‘All I can do is point you to [the
ACIC’s] knowledge of the environment. The FATF’s statements are the
statements’.
inquiry’s hearings, that same ACIC representative was hesitant to
characterise Australia’s absence of tranche
two reporting requirements as
‘something that is stopping us having an understanding of the insights
that are occurring in
money laundering and global [organised crime]
Nonetheless,
he expressed the view that the ACIC would be ‘very happy to receive any
additional intelligence, information or
powers that would help [the ACIC] to
better shape the picture of serious and organised crime in this country,
particularly around
professional
facilitators’.
Thus, to the extent that they expressed support for tranche two,
representatives from the executive principally referenced domestic
intelligence concerns, giving the FATF’s recommendations and reports a
less prominent role in their submissions.
The FATF’s recommendations and
reports provided important context for the reforms being discussed but the
evidence that these
representatives provided to the Committee was principally
based on their experiences illustrating the need for law reform. Importantly,
there was divergence among the views expressed to the inquiry’s hearings,
with some witnesses expressing reservations about
tranche two with reference to
both its importance and practicality. Representatives of the executive also
disputed the notion that

envisaged substantial tailoring of tranche two to domestic and industry-specific
conditions including through collaborative co-design

Legislators
The foregoing analysis of the input to the Committee suggests that the
executive has not been a key instrument (or even advocate)
for aligning
Australian AML/CTF policy with FATF recommendations. Further, all witnesses
consulted by the Committee envisaged that
Australia had considerable autonomy to
design tranche two reforms in line with local conditions and policy
preferences.
Such findings
are buttressed by an analysis of the questions posed, as well as by the views
and conclusions expressed, by the Senators
on the Committee as elected members
of the Parliament. While it
is important to note that parliamentary committees do not necessarily
represent the full range of views in ordinary parliamentary
debate, the
Committee did include representatives of both the then Coalition government, the
then Labor opposition and also the Greens.
On 30 March 2022, the Committee
reported back to the Senate with respect to its terms of reference with concrete
recommendations.
A key theme in the Committee’s questioning, which is consistent with
our earlier findings, was that it was not Senators in government
who used the
FATF to support or justify reforms that were substantively aligned with the
FATF’s recommendations. Instead, it
was opposition Labor Senators that
used the FATF’s outputs to criticise the gap between the
government’s stated domestic
and international commitment to implementing
tranche two and its legislative
As Labor Senator
Deborah O’Neill said,
[t]he government has made a number of assertions in public fora and continues to
state that it supports tranche 2 reforms. It did
some work in 2015; it came up
with a plan in 2016 with 84 recommendations, of which 49 were not implemented;
and in Rome a couple
of weeks ago the Prime Minister signed off on ‘I
agree with tranche 2 and everything with FATF.’ Yet here we are, one
three remaining nations — along with Haiti and Madagascar — who are
supposedly committed to tranche 2 but have not
implemented tranche 2
O’Neill noted that the government’s failure to act on the FATF
recommendations and MERs

Australia was ‘recalcitrant in terms of international
citizenship’.
Kim Carr likened the tranche two process to ‘

explicitly sought to link failures of regulatory action, in questions to the DHA
and AUSTRAC, to ‘a lack of backup from
government’.
Paul Scarr, from the then governing Liberal Party, was less explicit in his
criticism of the government’s lack of action
and did not reference the
FATF recommendations and MERs in his
questioning.
However, the
unanimous view of the inquiry’s bipartisan committee, as expressed in its
report, was that ‘Australia [was]
a laggard on the world stage’, and
the Committee noted further that
[a]s a founding member of FATF, Australia has committed to the implementation of
its recommendations and has reaffirmed its commitment
as recently as the G20
summit in Rome in October 2021. The government’s failure to enact tranche

these commitments. It is difficult to ignore the
gap between the Commonwealth government’s words and its

While the Senators
referred to the FATF’s recommendations and MERs as evidence about
the substantive risks and benefits of tranche two, they were not the sole
evidence — they were cited alongside the work of AUSTRAC
and the ACIC and
other evidence presented.
The Senators on the Committee engaged substantively with diverse viewpoints
expressed by stakeholders, especially those from tranche
two industries,
including thorny questions posed about regulatory burden and the potential
corrosion of legal professional privilege.
Senator Scarr suggested caution
‘about extending [the AML/CTF] regulatory regime both to the legal
profession and also more
broadly to accounting and real estate
businesses’
‘get the proportionality right and not impose ... an unreasonable burden
upon what, in many cases, are small
businesses’.
Scarr’s view, striking this balance would require a careful cost-benefit
analysis, consultation with industry and
a ‘bespoke’ solution to
extending AML/CTF requirements to tranche two
industries.
The Senators also
emphasised the importance of collaboration and consultation between industry and
regulators and cost-benefit analyses
(as recommended in the 2016 Statutory
The substantive
engagement of the Senators was also evident from their extensive questions about
contradictory evidence concerning
regulatory burden provided by the LCA and AML
compliance professionals.
In sum, the foregoing analysis suggests that the Senators engaged in detailed
consideration and contestation of the domestic desirability
and potential
consequences of tranche two regulatory expansion. The Committee’s
deliberations involved wide consultation in
a robust parliamentary process that
allowed stakeholders from industry and civil society, different parts of the
executive and legislators
themselves the opportunity to express, interrogate and
contest substantive questions on the desirability and potential nature of
tranche two. The FATF’s recommendations and peer reviews and the risk of
grey-listing played important roles in prompting the
Senate to refer the subject
of AML/CTF to the Committee and were deployed by Senators and witnesses to
criticise Australia’s
lack of action on tranche two and to evidence the
risk of money laundering in tranche two professions. This did not, however,
the consideration of other perspectives, different reform options and
arguments against tranche two.
Further, rather than seeking to push through the FATF’s desired
policies without significant legislative involvement, the representatives
executive were reserved in their references to the FATF and expressed mixed
views about the need for reform. Importantly,
the deliberation described above
revealed the
content of AML/CTF law reform, such as the
trade-offs between different policy goals (eg prosecuting crime, minimising the
of crime proceeds on housing prices and the tax burden, and avoiding
excessive and duplicative compliance burdens) and professional
values (eg legal
professional privilege and confidentiality). Finally, all participants proceeded
on the assumption that Australia
had considerable leeway to design and tailor
its laws to make choices about those trade-offs, as other jurisdictions had done
As such, our analysis suggests that Australia’s FATF peer reviews
triggered and informed local debate about law reform without
necessarily
predetermining its final outcome. As the DHA submission to the 2021–22
Senate Inquiry explained, ‘Australia
can shape the global standards in a
way that meet[s] our domestic settings, context and
interests’.
These conclusions are fortified by the Committee’s report, which did
not recommend the immediate implementation of tranche two
or any rigid
importation of the FATF’s peer review
recommendations.
Instead, the
Committee’s first two recommendations were that the Government should
accelerate ‘its consultation with
stakeholders on the timely
implementation of tranche 2 reforms in line with the [FATF’s]
recommendations’ and should
consider matters including regulatory burden,
opportunities arising from technological innovation and the relevance of
existing regulatory
and professional obligations for tranche two
industries.
Committee’s report also emphasised concerns about legal professional
privilege, referred to lessons that could be learned
from the diverse approaches
of other jurisdictions including the UK, New Zealand and Canada and noted that
‘the model proposed
must be context-specific and compatible with
Australian law’.
the Committee’s third recommendation was to consider whether the
AML/CTF Act
should ‘be amended to ensure the proper operation of
legal professional
privilege’.
These recommendations were accepted by the 2022–25 Labor government
which, in April 2023, announced that further public consultation
place on the implementation of significant reforms to Australia’s AML/CTF
This included
consultation on how to make the existing domestic AML/CTF regime more efficient

IV CONCLUSION
Australian law and regulatory practice concerning money laundering and
terrorism financing have been significantly influenced by the
transnational
standards regime established under the FATF. The importance of this informal
network, populated by unelected regulatory
officials and experts (including from
Australia), in shaping domestic lawmaking has given rise to understandable
concerns that the
FATF regime might encourage the local adoption of potentially
ill-fitting rules and may be at odds with fundamental democratic commitments

Through a close analysis of the FATF regime (and Australia’s role
within it) and domestic processes of lawmaking, this article
has sought to show
the persistence of Australia’s ordinary parliamentary lawmaking and
consultation processes in which public
and private actors have a significant
degree of agency, participation and opportunity for contestation notwithstanding

local reform. Further, Australia was revealed to have played an active role
within the FATF as an exemplar, rule-maker and promoter
of the FATF regime.
In Part III, we explored the quality of domestic legislative, deliberative
and consultative processes attending major Australian reforms
to reveal a
different relationship between Australia and the FATF compared to the
relationship suggested by the coercive compliance
critique. Instead of the FATF
dictating policies that are subsequently incorporated domestically by the
executive, our analysis suggests
that the FATF’s standards and system of
peer review have prompted and informed domestic deliberation about the
substantive
domestic problems arising from money laundering. Thus, rather than
empowering the executive, the FATF’s peer reviews of Australia
fact armed reformers in Parliament and the public, including industry
stakeholders and civil society, with arguments and
evidence that enrich local
deliberations. Further, representatives of the executive have not characterised
the FATF recommendations
and MERs as compelling specific solutions, focusing
instead on the domestic issues of addressing money laundering, terrorism
and related predicate crimes.
Our analysis of the interaction between the FATF and domestic lawmaking
processes in Australia provides support for the claim, made
experimentalist literature, that transnational peer review can aid democracy by
destabilising existing understandings and
claims to authority and by encouraging
broad participation and contestation with respect to the formulation of public

diverse deployment of FATF peer reviews by different actors in government,
industry and civil society to support different positions
on tranche two in
Australia is consonant with this notion of democracy-enhancing destabilisation.
Further, the wide consultation
of Australian stakeholders both in the
FATF’s own peer review processes and in domestic processes (including the
conduct of AUSTRAC) indicates that one of the central requirements of
experimentalist democratisation — broad participation
in the policymaking
process — is present in this
The potentially democratising influence of transnational peer review is
further illustrated by the involvement of Australian stakeholders
in the local
design and implementation of AML/CTF policy. Australian financial sector and
civil society actors have participated
in FATF consultations and peer reviews
and, together with representatives of the affected professions, have been
actively involved
in public debate and collaborative policy design with
regulators in Australia. Apart from a democracy reinforcing effect, the
consideration
of a wider set of policy options and the incorporation of
transnational peer benchmarking vis-a-vis domestic implementation and
enforcement
experience may facilitate the co-design of rules that respond more
effectively to local problems and
conditions.
Notwithstanding these generally optimistic findings, we also acknowledge
several points of caution emerging from our analysis. First,
while stakeholder
involvement that includes relevant private actors can be seen as a promising
expansion of the policymaking discourse,
the extensive involvement of industry
stakeholders in the processes of policy design (as suggested by witnesses before
the 2021–22
Senate Inquiry) might give rise to regulatory
In a similar vein, our analysis of the 2021–22 Senate Inquiry highlights
the peculiar prominence afforded to the emerging AML
compliance profession in
shaping and implementing Australian AML/CTF
These ‘foot
soldiers’ of the AML/CTF regime, who have emerged in banks’
compliance departments and compliance service
providers, have become
increasingly professionalised and play a central role in the day-to-day
implementation of AML/CTF
In fact, Eleni
Tsingou has argued that compliance professionals tend to interpret AML/CTF
policy more rigidly and expansively than
either the FATF member jurisdictions or
their parliaments intended.
As such, the emergence of an epistemic community of regulatory experts, arguably
facilitated by transnational peer networking, can
contribute to
‘regulatory creep’ by creating self-interested advocates seeking the
expansion of AML/CTF rules and the
implementation of burdensome compliance
programs that might not be justified by law or reasonable risk
assessments.
Such tendencies for regulatory capture could, of course, be counterbalanced
by input from other stakeholders. In the 2021–22
Senate Inquiry,
representatives of affected professions and civil society raised arguments about
the cost and compliance burdens
of new AML/CTF rules and the extent to which
existing domestic laws might achieve the FATF’s policy objectives.
Senators on
the Committee not only called for the development of proportionate
rules to advance those objectives through input and consultation
allowed the more dispersed interests affected by AML/CTF activities to be placed
centrestage in the inquiry even if those
interests were not represented by
specific organised civil society representatives. While many of the victims of
money laundering
by criminal organisations and terrorism financing are difficult
to identify and are often beyond Australia’s borders, Senators
Committee pointed out that these activities also affect those who run a
legitimate business or seek to purchase real estate
in Australia and place a
disproportionate burden on Australian taxpayers. It remains an open question,
however, whether such deliberation
allows lawmaking processes to absorb public
perspectives in all their variety and nuance including those of
people impacted by public
regulation.
Further, while our analysis indicates that the interactions between Australia
and the FATF do not ineluctably support the coercive
compliance account, the
FATF regime may constrain policy autonomy in other jurisdictions. Australia is a
highly developed and wealthy
well-integrated into global financial
It was a founding
member of the FATF, it is represented within the FATF Plenary and it acts as a
rule-promoter within the Asia-Pacific
region through its leadership in the
regional APG network.
such, it engages with the FATF from a position of relative strength: this may
not be the experience of smaller, less-developed
members of the FATF and whose local regulatory institutions and expertise are
less elaborate.
Even with respect to Australia, our argument has not
been that the FATF does not constrain domestic lawmaking. It is clear from our
analysis that the FATF’s standards and peer review system play an
important role in setting the agenda for domestic law reform,
in influencing
Australian lawmakers to address substantive AML/CTF issues and in enlisting
Australian financial institutions, who
are interested in maintaining their
access to international capital, as promoters of the FATF’s policy
However, our findings also suggest that, in light of the experimentalist
character of the FATF regime, the FATF’s recommendations
may be viewed as
broadly formulated minimum standards that leave significant room for domestic
tailoring. Moreover, the discussion
in Part III reveals substantial domestic
consultation and contestation among Australian legislators, stakeholders and
civil society
framework to address substantive problems, which are of interest
to Australians,
including the economic and human loss in connection to transnational crime.
While it is possible to argue that any
constraints on parliamentary lawmaking
arising as a result of transnational cooperation efforts undermine democracy, to
reflect an unrealistic view of the nature of lawmaking in a modern
democracy. Parliament is never unconstrained in its lawmaking,
whether this be
by reason of transnational cooperation, a constitution made over a century ago
or by virtue of international economic
and political interdependence. The effect
of the FATF is not unique in this respect.
Finally, our analysis raises some doubts about a normative claim about
experimentalist global governance: that networked governance
relying on peer
review and penalty defaults to engender local policy change contributes to
effective and rapid policy innovation.
While we observe that FATF peer reviews
have played a role in prompting domestic reforms, such reforms have been subject
to significant
delay. Tranche two in Australia was not passed into law until
2024 with the majority of those reforms not commencing until 2026,
almost twenty
years later than when they were originally meant to be implemented (following
the initial 2006 reforms).
Notwithstanding the fact that FATF peer reviews have kept these reforms on the
policy agenda in Australia, in the absence of domestic
political will and in
light of opposition from vested interests, an experimentalist global governance
regime may not produce fast
or effective policy reform — this is possibly
the price to be paid for respecting domestic processes and
By interrogating in detail the interactions between the FATF regime and
domestic lawmaking processes, we present a complex and nuanced
account of a
transnational network that has furthered domestic deliberative and consultative
processes for reforming Australia’s
AML/CTF law without mandating outcomes
or necessarily leading to efficient and effective policy change. While many of
the existing
legitimate critiques of the FATF focus on the problem of
accountability in transnational governance and its effect on democratic
lawmaking, we have sought to highlight evidence that may attenuate those
concerns. We have argued that the FATF’s experimentalist
global governance
regime, particularly its system of peer review, can complement, rather than
supplant, domestic democratic and deliberative
processes in designing responses
to pressing policy concerns. At the same time, our analysis suggests that the
role of the private
sector in shaping policy, the assessment of regulatory
efficacy and failure and the possible trade-off between democratic and effective
policy reform may be of greater concern in rethinking existing mechanisms of
review and consultation at both the domestic and transnational
