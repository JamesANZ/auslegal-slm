1. Introduction
While part of our daily life, social media
platforms are still largely a
terra incognita

infinite scrolling, their perils under-explored and their future hard to
predict. This uncertain ground, paired
with the increasing daily use of social

Beyond the commonly
described dangers such as graphic materials or cyberbullying, the way social
media features are designed is starting
to raise concerns. Personalised
algorithms and addictive features are ever-present in order to gain the valuable
‘commodity’
of consumers’
As a result, new
regulations are being proposed at both the international and national
The United States was among
the first to act when its Surgeon General’s 2023 Advisory on Social Media
and Youth Mental Health
was issued. This document was one of the first to
address the health harms potentially caused by social media, highlighting
design as a key factor in its negative impact on young people’s
mental health. Following the publication of the Advisory, nearly
all US states
have introduced measures to address its key concerns.
The aim of this article is to review Bills from 37 US states regulating the
alleged impact of social media platform design on youth
The regulations and
measures introduced are evaluated through the theory of placebo policies, to
assess any potential disparities
between their declared impact, their
consequences and the law-makers’ intention behind their introduction. This
article showcases
the Surgeon General’s recommendations and analyses the
regulations introduced as a result in light of the placebo policy concept.
theoretical framework serves the purpose of examining whether the proposed
measures prioritise effective solutions or their
goal is rather to simply signal
the law-makers’ intention to handle the problems described above, and to
subsequently manage
the complex societal emotions they induce. The key findings
are that the US law-makers have made commendable efforts to address social
harms, particularly through mental health and education-focused regulations,
though some measures suffer from over-reliance
on techno-solutionism and
emotionally driven narratives. More problematic are laws targeting minors’
use of social media, which
often lack a clear understanding of user behaviour
and thus risk functioning as ineffective, placebo-driven policies.
2. The Surgeon General’s Advisory and Its Roots
Children and adolescents actively engage with social media. While the exact
percentage varies depending on the researched population
cohort, for teenagers
studies indicate usage at or above 90 per
The reasons for this are
similar to the motivations of anyone choosing to use social media platforms,
regardless of their age, including
staying in touch with others, forming new
relationships – whether
– and engaging with
content. For school-aged children, social media are a key communication tool for
classmates and teachers,
facilitating group chats for class updates, activities
and study materials.
Despite these benefits, drawbacks also exist. Digital safety has long been a
heavily discussed topic. Analysing expert reports and
advisories reveals that,
until the mid-2010s, the primary concerns about children’s online presence
centred on the people they

simultaneously. During the late 2000s

insecurities.
One common denominator of these dangers is that none originates solely from
the internet. Retouched photos appear in traditional media,
threats can come
through calls or notes and harmful individuals exist beyond the virtual world.
Researchers in the mid-2010s, however,
cast a spotlight on an issue going far
deeper in its origins: the feature design, including factors contributing to

sarcastic in 2015, this remark could easily constitute a hallmark feature of the
social media landscape in the 2020s.
For several years, researchers have
highlighted the connection between social media use and dopamine release,
demonstrating how platforms
are designed to trigger the brain’s reward
system. This process encourages addictive

in adolescents, impairing their self-regulation and leading to developing
impulsive screen time habits.
Researchers have also found a connection – albeit correlational –
between increased consumption of short audiovisual

and decreased attention spans in both
Given the widespread nature and potential consequences of these issues, the
urgency of regulating the digital environment has become
evident. For these
reasons, in 2023, the US Surgeon General issued the Advisory on Social
Media and Youth Mental Health, a document
that calls for a holistic approach to
assess the benefits and risks surrounding social media. The Surgeon General
proposed solutions
aimed at children and adolescents, their parents and
caregivers, technology companies, researchers and policy-makers. Duties imposed
on the latter are the focus of this article.
The Surgeon General issued five main directives on what policy-makers can do
1. Strengthen protections to ensure greater safety for children and
adolescents interacting with all social media platforms, by:
a. Developing age-appropriate health and safety standards for technology
b. Require a higher standard of data privacy for children and
adolescents.
c. Pursue policies that further limit access – in ways that minimize
the risk of harm—to social media for all children
and adolescents.
2. Ensure technology companies share data relevant to the health impact of
their platforms with independent researchers and the public
in a manner that is
timely, sufficiently detailed, and protects privacy.
3. Support the development, implementation, and evaluation of digital and
media literacy curricula in schools and within academic
4. Support increased funding for future research on the benefits and harms of
social media use.
5. Engage with international partners working to protect children and
adolescents against online harm to their health and
Based on the Bills examined in this article, policy-makers have primarily
adhered to the proposals outlined in sections 1(b), 1(c),
3 and 4. Additionally,
they implemented measures such as restricting access to inappropriate content,
enforcing data protection or
regulating children’s legal status as social
media creators. While important, these solutions were not covered in this
given the scope of its objectives.
Following an analysis of the proposed regulations from 37 states, the
strategies they encompass can be broadly categorised into five
1. Prohibiting or restricting the use of social media in any way (with a
focus on minors).
2. Proposals for introducing digital and media literacy curricula in
3. Introducing any kind of built-in age-verification requirement and/or
parental supervision embedded in the applications while using
social media.
4. Introducing regulations focusing on harm to mental health/well-being and
supporting potentially relevant research.
5. Proposing regulations concerning the liability of companies offering
social media platforms that may be harmful (especially to
minors) due to their
design (the focus on design rather than content present in the medium here is
The next section provides a concise overview of selected regulations within
each of these categories and evaluates specific proposed
solutions. Some of the
Bills have already been enacted, some remain pending and some have not advanced
further in the legislative
The objective of this review is to examine how policy-makers have attempted
to translate the Surgeon General’s recommendations
into legislative action
rather than focusing on their practical implications or implementation. Even the
rationale behind the least
feasible regulations offers a valuable foundation for
further exploration, potentially informing future legislative efforts, both
within and beyond the United States.
3. Theories of Placebo Policies and Legislative Placebo
The section above outlined the seriousness and urgency of the perils posed by
the virtual environment. Paired with the growing pressure
to undertake
counter-measures, this creates a pressing point for policy-makers. Notably, the
Surgeon General continued to explore
additional ways to protect social media
users from its potential harm. In June 2024, he suggested the possibility of
mandating warning
labels – similar to those found on cigarette packages
– that would notify users of the significant mental health risks
associated with social media upon entering such platforms. As he says,
‘[a] surgeon general’s warning label, which requires
congressional
action, would regularly remind parents and adolescents that social media has not
been proved safe’.
Handling such tension can lead to an increase in societal approval, even if
short-lived and built on promises rather than actual steps
taken. Such a
phenomenon can be described as a ‘placebo policy’, a term first used
by Gustaffson and Richardson
authors address the question of what some policies are fundamentally designed to
accomplish. One motivation they distinguished
was creating the appearance of
addressing a problem without providing an actual solution (similar to a placebo
used in medicine,
where instead of interacting with one’s system, it
creates the illusion of a medical intervention taking place). This approach
often used to placate public concerns, allowing politicians to claim that they
have acted on an issue while sidestepping substantial
change. Such policies
might involve reinterpreting the problem in a way that minimises its
significance or redirects attention, satisfying
just the immediate societal
While serving as
effective tools for politicians to manage their agendas, placebo policies are
often revealed to be superficial in
nature, potentially resulting in the
re-emergence of the unresolved issues they were intended to address, as noted by
Stringer and
Richardson.
recently, placebo policies were further theorised by Alan McConnell:
At a very basic level, a placebo policy is a policy produced partially or
significantly ‘for show’, and hence, policy-making
is driven in part
by the desire to demonstrate that government is ‘doing something’ to
tackle a tough policy
McConnell also notes that placebo policies come across as a very useful tool
to manage societal emotions connected with issues such
as complex policy
challenges, alongside the rapid emergence of media crises or scandals as well as
public sector under-performance.
Studying these policies involves three main goals: capturing their evidence
through research; explaining their specific dynamics
within various governance
contexts; and evaluating their impact on public perceptions and the ethical
implications.
Mateusz Stępień studied how a legal outlook on placebo policies
could be formed. According to him, using a legal placebo
must mean that
‘legislators (who
hold political power) issue normative
acts which, to the best of their knowledge, do not have real effects, such as
the protection
or multiplication of values that underlie
The legislators,
according to Stępień, ‘intentionally deceive society by
introducing legal acts which, as they are
fully aware, will not solve the
“diagnosed”
He also notes
that one should distinguish such cynically introduced laws from those that may
not be the best reaction to the problem
at hand, but are genuinely proposed to
actually offer some sort of solution.
He suggests the following
characteristics of a
legislative placebo
: (1) an intervention, consisting
of preparation and enactment of a legislation, (2) formally undertaken by the
legislature, realistically
animated by the centre of legislative power, (3)
intended for solving a given social problem, (4) where the creators know or
that such legislation is defective and will not practically lead to the
officially communicated goals, and (5) despite being aware
of the foregoing, it
still is enacted.
Stępień’s framework thus once again focuses on the
law-makers’ intention to manage societal emotions rather
than solve an
emerging issue, taking into consideration their role within the political and
legal system. Tied closely to the legislative
aspect of placebo policies, this
approach aids the evaluation of US regulations reviewed in this article.
This framework, naturally, is not without methodological challenges. Perhaps
the most significant lies in its heavy reliance on assessing
legislative intent.
While certain documents explicitly articulate the law-makers’ rationale
for proposing specific solutions,
such clarity is the exception rather than the
rule. More often, legislative intent is not readily discernible from the text
As a result, its interpretation is highly susceptible to subjective
bias, raising legitimate concerns about whether it constitutes
a reliable basis
for evaluating a policy. Despite this issue, the rationale for selecting this
concept for analysis stems from a
critical examination of the proposed
solutions. Referring to McConnell’s identification of areas most prone to
placebo policies
– particularly the sudden emergence of media scandals or
public sector organisational under-performance – it is evident
social media crisis aligns closely with this framework. While its growth is not
sudden, as mentioned previously, the crisis
and its connection to public health
have only gained mainstream recognisability over the past few years, leading to
the problem being
widely discussed with little to no open
The Surgeon
General’s report points out this organisational under-performance and is
itself a call for the reforms described
by McConnell. Given this pressure on
law-makers, as well as the potential gain in societal trust, the risk of
implementing placebo
policies is tangible. To preserve the image of a decisive
and responsive body, the authorities strive to act swiftly despite the
requiring complex, intrusive frameworks for effective resolution. Prioritising
such immediate, superficial solutions over
comprehensive long-term strategies
could be described as cynical; however, although the placebo regulations are
deemed inherently
flawed, the literature also acknowledges their potential to
foster a public perception of safety and governmental
attentiveness
– which are,
overall, beneficial states to be achieved. Consequently, my objective is to
evaluate the assumption that the introduced
policies bear characteristics of
placebo policies and assess its validity in relation to the regulations
currently being developed.
4. A Review of the Proposed Regulations
4.1. Regulations Prohibiting or Restricting the Use of Social Media in
Any Way (with a Focus on Children)
This section covers restrictions imposed on social media users. Most of the
Bills described intend to prohibit the use of social media
on school grounds
during school hours. A great example of this was introduced in
HB 1463 2023
(Florida), according to which a private school is required to establish a
policy regarding students’ use of personal wireless
communication devices
on school property or during school events. This policy must prohibit device use
during school hours, except
for classroom instruction, emergencies or
communication with parents, siblings or legal
HB 1986 2023
(Massachusetts) proposes the establishment of standardised guidelines for school
districts. These guidelines would address the use
of social media by students
during school hours and provide strategies for managing issues within schools
that stem from social media
use outside of school
(Florida) states that regulations shall prohibit and prevent students from
accessing social media platforms via school district-provided
internet, except
when explicitly directed by a teacher for educational purposes. Additionally, it
mandates a prohibition on the use
of TikTok, or any similar successor platform,
on district-owned devices, through the school district’s internet, or as a
for communication or promotion by any district school, school-sponsored
club, extracurricular organisation or athletic
There is also legislation limiting access hours outside school. An example is
SB 152 2023
(Utah), proposing that a social media company must restrict a
Utah minor’s account access from 10.30 p.m. to 6.30 a.m. unless
applicable law allows a
modification.
HB 271 2024
(Alaska) contains a similar
proposition.
S 7694 2024
(New York) suggests that the operator of an addictive social media platform
shall provide a mechanism allowing a verified parent to
prevent their child from
accessing such platform between the hours of 12 a.m. and 6 a.m. This Bill
proposes another solution found
among those focusing on access restriction,
proposing that parents should be able to restrict their child’s access to
social media platforms to a
length of time per day (rather than
to certain hours).
Another group of restrictive regulations suggests complete TikTok bans,
introduced in Montana
Law-makers cited
national security concerns over data collection and potential espionage by its
Chinese parent company,
rather than child
protection or mental health, with the Hawai’i regulation referring to this
issue only through citing publicists
dubbing the app ‘digital
fentanyl’. With the regulations serving a completely different purpose,
children’s mental
health was used merely as a rhetorical tool, weakly
justifying national security-related concerns.
While restricting social media use during schooltime or late-night hours may
benefit the minors, it may not represent the best strategy
for addressing the
concerns outlined in the Surgeon General’s report. It is true that
research demonstrates that late-night
social media activity can have detrimental
effects on an individual’s mental and physical
well-being;
however, the
proposed measures possess little efficacy in terms of meaningfully supporting
young social media users in navigating
this complex issue. Numerous readily
conceivable methods to circumvent the proposed restrictions render their
effectiveness questionable.
For such regulations to achieve their intended
purpose, platforms would need to be universally inaccessible during nighttime
by design, applying indiscriminately to all users. This approach, however,
inevitably raises concerns about whether such measures
verge on excessive
paternalism, particularly in relation to adult users. Nonetheless, addressing
this issue more comprehensively
would require engaging in solving the
multifaceted issue beyond fostering the superficial sense of safety (as
mentioned in the end
of Section 3), which the law-makers often appear reluctant
4.2. Regulations Including Proposals for Introducing Digital and Media
Literacy Curricula in Schools
This group of regulations appears to have been most vigorously enacted by the
reviewed states. The law-makers employ a range of terminology
to describe the
skillsets in question. While the overarching goals of these regulations are
largely consistent and aligned, some
proposals introduce particularly intriguing
SB 1573 2024
(Arizona), it is proposed that the State Department of
Education shall identify practices, make recommendations for instruction in
digital citizenship and make available on its website a list of resources on
media literacy. The key definition here is ‘digital
citizenship’,
being ‘a diverse set of skills related to current technology and social
media, including the norms of appropriate,
responsible, and healthy
Media literacy
includes the foundational skills that lead to
A unique regulation among these was proposed through
HB 1463 2023
(Florida). Aside from the curriculum, it covered digital learning itself,
with a strict limitation that no more than 10 per cent of
the instructional time
given in a traditional school setting for Pre-Kindergarten through Grade 8 in a
public school may be delivered
in an electronic or a digital

definition of digital citizenship by presenting a more intricate and expansive

component. It addresses the social, emotional and
physical effects of social media. This component must encompass, but is not
to, the negative impacts of social media on mental health, including
addiction, the spread of misinformation, the ways in which social
manipulates behaviour and the enduring nature of shared content
SB 287 2024
(Indiana), aside from the focus on the well-researched social media perils,
proposed a curriculum covering the relationship between
users and content
providers, the providers’ incentives to shape user behaviour and methods
used to influence that
Remarkably, no other
state has introduced a similar proposal.
4.3. Proposals Introducing Any Kind of Age-Verification Requirement
and/or Parental Supervision While Using Social Media
When regulations within this category are introduced, they frequently
stipulate that unauthorised minors must have any existing accounts
deleted and
are prohibited from creating new accounts independently (such as
(Maryland),
(Arkansas),
SB 162 2023
(Louisiana)
In this situation, most of them require a legal guardian’s consent for a
minor to set up an account on a social media platform.
An interesting exception
(Maryland) (not enacted), going in the
direction of creating so-called ‘joint accounts’, where each large
social media
platform allows the parents or guardians of an authorised minor to
create a joint social media account with the authorised
This might raise ethical
concerns regarding a child’s privacy (outside the scope of this review).
SB 162 2023
(Louisiana) states that a social media company
must allow a parent or guardian who consents to a Louisiana minor’s
enable supervision, including viewing privacy settings, setting time
limits, scheduling breaks and receiving notifications when the
minor reports an
was enacted in Florida, according to which social media
platforms must assess user accounts to determine whether they belong to
individuals
aged 15 years or younger, using age-related data and account
categorisation for content and ad targeting. Accounts found to belong
under 14 years must be terminated. Additionally, parents or users can request
account termination.
Wisconsin, an interesting concept of a
youth account
was proposed.
According to
SB 385 2024
, social media companies must ensure that all
accounts created are designated as such, with the possibility of removing the

verification.
This proposition,
having raised numerous concerns even beyond the legal
has failed to pass
pursuant to Senate Joint Resolution.
The verification methods for both the age of an individual interested in
setting up an account and parental consent constitute another
interesting area
of these regulations. In some cases, they involve standard documents such as an
ID card or a driver’s licence
SB 396 2023
(Arkansas),
and in the case
(New Jersey) also presented during a
video-conference with an authorised
and sometimes a designed
system (as in
Of course, not every state thought of such elaborate ways to avoid letting a
minor into the dangerous world of social media; in
HB 591 2023
the law-makers chose to simply employ a disclaimer. As the Bill states, a social
media platform should require a minor
to accept the following statement:
This application may be harmful to your mental health and may use design
features that have addictive qualities or present unverified
information or that
may be manipulated by [insert platform name] for your viewing. This application
may also collect your personal
data to further manipulate your viewable content
and may share your personal data with
This regulation appears considerably less convincing than other policies
mentioned in this section. The disclaimer provided is neither
informative nor
persuasive. It fails to elucidate the harms that may befall users, and it does
not specify which features of the
platform require attention. In fact, it stands
as a quintessential example of a legislative placebo. It is highly improbable
law-makers genuinely believe that such a disclaimer would meaningfully
mitigate the harmful effects of social media usage. This is
further supported by
the research consistently showing that government-mandated disclaimers rarely
achieve the intended protective
Assuming the
legislators’ competence in the formulation of effective legislation, it
can only be inferred that, in this instance,
they have permitted the enactment
of a (potentially) flawed and ineffective law.
4.4. Introducing Regulations Focusing on Harm to Mental
Health/Well-being and Supporting Potential Research Regarding Them
This set of regulations is less structured than those discussed previously
but is no less significant. The Bills clarify how legislators
define mental
health and its related harms, highlighting their connection to broader
well-being.
The authors of
(Pennsylvania) suggest that social media use
among teens is associated with negative emotions, including higher rates of
and anxiety. They also refer to research suggesting that social media
can exacerbate offline violence and that suicide and self-harm
rates among
American teenagers have risen significantly in recent
HB 1463 2023
(Florida) also refers to research claiming that excessive digital media use has
been linked to various negative outcomes, such as
disrupted sleep patterns,
exposure to harmful online relationships and content, self-harm and suicidal
thoughts, and Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The law-makers
also claim that chronic sensory stimulation from excessive screen time can mimic
early-stage
dementia, affecting concentration, memory, orientation and
HF 192 2023
(Minnesota) turns to the notion of
digital well-being
, which seems to
encompass a much broader meaning than just mental health. It recognises several
dimensions affected by excessive
social media use, including sleep disturbances,
eye strain and other physiological changes, as well as mental health, social
and cognitive functioning, leading to distractions, reduced academic
performance and an increase in symptoms of
While some of these claims – such as those regarding disruptive sleep
patterns and their consequences
– are unquestionably valid, others are fraught with insufficiently
examined assertions – for example, those concerning
the alleged
‘increase in ADHD’
or linking the general decline in mental health directly to social media without
taking numerous other factors into
consideration.
This line of
reasoning is undoubtedly capable of eliciting action; however, it also conveys
an air of unwarranted panic, perpetuating
the placebo-like character of the
proposed measures. It would unquestionably behove law-makers aiming to implement
the Surgeon General’s
recommendations for their arguments to be
underpinned by sound evidence.
(North Carolina) is one of the few Bills to consider the
potentially harmful relationship between data use and health (it refers
increasing ‘unhealthy social media use’ induced by data
exploitation).
AB 1282 2024
(California) requires the purposefully set up commission to report a
statewide strategy related to mental health risks associated
with the use of
social media by children and youth. Its novelty lies in defining ‘children
and youth’ as individuals
up to 26 years of
a very desirable direction
to follow considering that the adolescent brain is biologically predisposed to
adapt, as shown by heightened
sensitivity to social and emotional
information.
Constant exposure
to algorithmically tailored content on social media creates a continuous flow of
information, exacerbating the
issues related to adolescent vulnerabilities.
When examining the more significant dangers highlighted, the concept of
addiction emerges recurrently. A consensus can be found in
the definition of
addiction, generally characterised as the use of one or more social media
platforms, marked by an inability to
stop despite the desire to do so, causing
physical, mental, emotional, developmental or material harm to the child
However, some differences
in the definition also appear.
(Arkansas) addresses
addiction by prohibiting social media platforms from utilising technologies to
tailor content for minors based
on their personal data, preferences or
behaviour. Additionally, it forbids the use of features, designs or mechanisms
that encourage
or reward excessive or compulsive platform use or exploit the
psychological vulnerabilities of
allows individuals to file a lawsuit against a social media company to seek
damages for any addiction, financial, physical
or emotional harm suffered by a
Utah minor with an account after October 1, 2024 as a result of using the
While the definition
of addiction in this context appears vague, the proposal itself represents a
positive step forward in addressing
The concept of
addiction will play a crucial role in the next section, where it is used to
directly explore the underlying mechanisms
that contribute to the harm inflicted
on an individual. In this context, addiction serves as both a consequence and a
process, with
its implications extending beyond mere behavioural dependency to
encompass the psychological, emotional and social forces that drive
engagement with social media platforms.
Overall, these measures seem to display a techno-solutionist attitude on the
law-makers’ side, similar to one criticised by
Angel and boyd with respect
to the authors of the Kids Online Safety Act. As they argue, historical evidence
shows that such approaches
rarely achieve their intended outcomes. Rather than
encourage performative safety measures, reinforce techno-solutionist logic and
divert resources away from evidence-based
alternatives.
Simply put, these
measures are notoriously ineffective, yet they create a façade of a
decisive, responsive state authority.
This, in turn, heavily underscores their
placebo-like characteristic.
4.5 Proposing Regulations Concerning the Liability of Companies
Offering Social Media Platforms that May be Harmful (Especially to
Minors) Due
to Their Design
Finally, certain states have enacted regulations addressing the direct
liability of companies for providing products that are inherently
harmful and
hazardous by design. In these legislative efforts, law-makers focus primarily on
user-driven algorithms, which may or
may not incorporate addictive features, and
the potential risks they pose to users. The Bills that do not rely principally
addiction framework typically focus on regulating aspects such as
advertising practices, data usage or the management of user-generated
SF 2101 2023
(Minnesota) states that a social media platform with
more than one million account holders operating in Minnesota is prohibited from
using a social media algorithm to target UGC at an account holder under the age
of 18 years (with some
exceptions).
HB 2155 2023
(Texas), a social media platform operator is liable to a minor who receives
UGC through an algorithm if the operator knew, or should
reasonably have known,
that the user was a minor.
According to
Rev Stat § 51:1753
(Louisiana), a minor
account holder shall be protected from unsolicited adult messages (unless
previously connected with such adult),
targeted ads using personal data (except
age and location) and excessive data collection beyond necessary
SB 222 2023
(Kansas) states that any provider of an online platform
shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of information published by
of such online platform if such provider knew or should have known such provider
used an algorithm to make personalised recommendations
to a user of such online
platform, and such posts materially contributed to a physical or severe
emotional injury to such a user.
An algorithm here means any computational
process, model, or other automated means of processing to rank, order, promote,
amplify or similarly alter the delivery or display of information,
and the online platform is any digital service that facilitates
interactions
between two or more independent users who interact through the
What is particularly
compelling about this regulation is the dual requirement of both employing such
an algorithm and demonstrating
its contribution to user harm. However, the
nature of the harm inflicted remains ambiguously defined, as emotional injury
interpreted in various ways depending on the context. For example, as per
Kentucky Revised Statutes Chapter 600 – Introductory matters 600.020
Definitions for KRS Chapters 600 to 645
an injury to the mental or psychological capacity or emotional stability of a
child as evidenced by a substantial and observable impairment
child’s ability to function within a normal range of performance and
behaviour with due regard to his or her age, development,
culture, and
environment as testified to by a qualified mental health
professional.
But, as per The Children’s Centre for Communication/Beverly School for
‘Where Communication Comes First’ Manual
is ‘an impairment to or disorder of the intellectual or psychological
capacity of a child as evidenced by observable and
substantial reduction in the
child’s ability to function within the normal range of performance and
behaviour’.
Although these
definitions may not differ substantially, they do exhibit notable divergences,
which may undermine the regulation’s
capacity to fully address the range
of harm associated with social media use. A particularly concerning limitation
is the narrow
focus on only severe emotional injuries, thereby overlooking
potentially significant outcomes, such as social media addiction. Therefore,
this section would greatly benefit from a linguistic refinement that not only
clarifies the scope of harm but also reflects the multifaceted
nature of social
media’s impact, ensuring that all relevant forms of damage, from emotional
distress to behavioural addiction,
are adequately considered. Such an adjustment
would strengthen its effectiveness and better align it with the evolving
understanding
of the psychological risks posed by social media platforms.
While addiction is a recurring theme in mental health-related Bills, in
algorithm-focused legislation, the concept of an ‘addictive
platform/feed’ similarly addresses concerns about the psychological impact
of digital environments. The recently enacted
S 7694 2024
defines an ‘addictive feed’ as a website, online service or mobile
application where media shared or generated
by users is recommended, selected or
prioritised based on information linked to the user or their device, either
concurrently or
sequentially. However, this definition excludes certain cases
such as those where media are chosen by privacy settings or device
data, or when
the user requests it.
(New Jersey)
prohibits a social media platform from using
‘any practice, design, feature, or affordance that would cause child users
addicted to the
(North Carolina), intended to combat social media addiction by
requiring that social media platforms respect the privacy of North
users’ data and do not use a North Carolina minor’s data for
advertising or algorithmic recommendations and
to make willful violations of
data user privacy an unfair
an algorithmic
recommendation is one of ‘suggested, promoted, or ranked
information’. User data may be used in such recommendations
only when the
user has been notified and consents to the use of the data in such a manner.
AB 2273 2022
(California) mandates that businesses offering online
services, products or features likely to be accessed by children adhere to
specific requirements. These include configuring all default privacy settings to
ensure a high level of privacy, as outlined in the
regulations.
Approved by the
state governor in September 2024,
(California) directly follows
this up. According to its text, an ‘addictive feed’ is defined as an
internet website,
online service, online application or mobile application where
multiple pieces of user-generated media are recommended, selected
or prioritised
for display to a user based on information provided by the user or linked to
their device.
This definition
excludes certain cases, such as those where information is not persistently
linked to the user, is explicitly requested
without recommendation or is a part
of private communication, or when the media are simply the next item in a
pre-existing sequence
from the same source and, in the case of audio or video
content, it is not automatically played. The Bill bans operators from providing
addictive feeds unless they lack knowledge of the user being a minor, reasonably
determine otherwise or obtain parental consent.
It would also require an
operator to annually report the number of minor users, both those with parental
consent for addictive feeds
and those with or without access controls
The legislation discussed in this section provides a compelling example of
policies that are unlikely to serve merely a placebo function.
These regulations
establish the grounds for accountability in a clear and comprehensive manner.
Discrepancies in terminology across
different jurisdictions may exist, and they
do not appear to arise from a deliberate intent to propose flawed legislation;
they reflect less optimal phrasing. While it may be tempting to ascribe
these issues to a malicious legislative intent, is important
to recognise that
sometimes weak legislation is just that, with no hidden agenda behind its
creation. Although the placebo policy
framework offers few tools to discern
between those (other than one’s subjective interpretation and willingness
to see a flaw
for what it simply might be), it is rather safe to assume that, in
this case, there is no hidden agenda.
5. Discussion
The conclusions following my analysis are to some extent optimistic. The US
law-makers must be praised for their efforts to understand
how the addictive
features work. Here, the introduced regulations reflect the potential perils
accordingly, and the proposed measures
appear adequately chosen. The legislative
has the potential to be effective and does not come from the cynical place
mentioned in
the introductory parts of this text. Similar observations can be
made regarding regulations addressing school curricula on the safe
digital social media platforms. While most of the mental health-related
regulations can generally be evaluated positively,
certain elements of narrative
construction (as noted previously) can be identified, as well as the excessive
reliance on the techno-solutionist
paradigm. Nonetheless, these concerns do not
significantly raise doubts about whether the Bills were introduced with the
intent of producing only superficial effects. The real challenges
emerge with laws that impose direct prohibitions or obligations
on minors using
social media and their guardians. These regulations either reveal a profound
misunderstanding of how such users engage
with these platforms or suggest an
underlying motivation to present a solution that serves more as an ineffective
smokescreen. However,
it seems like a viable perspective that ongoing dialogue
with professionals and impartial experts will guide the development of
well-structured,
human-centred policies that truly benefit social media users,
rather than merely signalling a reactive stance to an escalating issue.
6. Conclusions
As the awareness of social media harms grows, new measures are being
proposed, highlighting the need for effective navigation of the
landscape. This review examined regulations introduced by 37 American states in
response to the US Surgeon General’s
recommendations, focusing on how
these proposals may, in some cases, function as legislative placebos. The goal
of this analysis
was to provide an overview of the approaches American
law-makers have been adopting to address this public health crisis and
scrutinise their approaches. While law-makers have provided a
comprehensive general framework for handling social media-related issues,
may be raised as to the justification for some of the measures introduced. It
could be said that there is a fair share of
fear-based rhetoric in the analysed
regulations, often overshadowing evidence-based statements that would support
the applied solutions
just as well. As more countries strive to introduce
regulations for a fair and just digital environment, such heavy reliance on
argumentation
appealing to emotions may not serve as a solid base. Given the
widely available research results, it is to be hoped that further
legislative
attempts in this field will find a more solid and stable knowledge base.

While the number of
diagnosed ADHD cases has recently increased in the United States, research
suggests that it is due to an overall
increase in diagnostic processes and
awareness, as well as the current formulation of diagnostic criteria, rather
than a true rise
in prevalence. See Gascon, “Do We Over-diagnose
ADHD?” and Abdelnour, “ADHD Diagnostic Trends.”
