Graham, S v Queensland Harness Racing Board [2002] QRAA 24 (5 December 2002)
RACING APPEALS AUTHORITY QUEENSLAND
[2002] QRAA 24
: 5 December 2002
APPEAL FROM
A decision of the Queensland Harness
Racing Board to impose a penalty of two weeks disqualification for a breach of
Rule 168 of the
Rules of Harness Racing.
APPEARANCES
Graham appeared on his own behalf.
Mr Norm Torpey Chairman of Stewards
appeared on behalf of the Queensland Harness Racing Board.
REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr Leo G Williams AO - Chairman
The Hon Sir James Killen - Deputy
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
This appeal by Mr
Graham arose out of an incident which occurred on the home turn in the front
straight in Race 2 at the Rocklea Paceway
on Saturday 23 November 2002. The
Stewards allege that Mr Graham was careless in allowing his horse Like A Crystal
to shift down
the track which tightened the racing room of Mr Gary Bond’s
horse Karloo Jet and made contact with Karloo Jet. This caused
Karloo Jet to
brake and several other runners to be checked.
Like A Crystal won the
race and immediately after the race Mr Bond requested an opportunity to view the
official films. After viewing
the films Mr Bond lodged a protest against Mr
Graham’s horse being placed first.
The Stewards dismissed the
protest stating that although Mr Bond received interference on the turn they
were not certain that Karloo
Jet would have beaten Like A Crystal home in the
The Stewards did however charge Mr Graham with a breach of Rule
168(1) which reads
“168. A person shall not before, during or after a race drive in a manner
which in the opinion of the stewards is careless,
reckless, intimidator, foul or
likely to endanger persons or horses.”
disputed the charge stating that he kept the same ground coming around the turn
and the cause of the incident was that there
simply wasn’t enough room for
Mr Bond to come through.
The film was shown and it supports the
Stewards’ version of the incident. Accordingly the Authority dismisses
the Appeal.
In relation to penalty and taking into account Mr
Graham’s submission as to his interstate drives which have been booked for
him, the Authority considers that a fine of $400.00 would be the appropriate
penalty and imposes that as the penalty in lieu of two
suspension.
The Appeal fee is forfeited.
