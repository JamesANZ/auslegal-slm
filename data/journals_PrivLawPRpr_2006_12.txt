Tasmanian Privacy Law commenced
Personal Information Protection Act 2004
(Tasmania) came into
effect on 5 September 2005. It applies to State government agencies, statutory
boards and statutory office holders,
government business enterprises (GBEs),
Ministers, the University of Tasmania, and all municipal councils, although
there are some
exemptions such as for courts, tribunals and law enforcement
activities. The Minister (for Justice and Industrial Relations) can
further exemptions on application. The law requires compliance with a set of
principles modelled on the federal National
amendment principles defer to the existing provisions of the
Information Act 1991
. Complaints about breaches of any of the principles
will be handled by the Tasmanian Ombudsman http://www.ombudsman.tas.gov.au/

Workplace Surveillance law commences in NSW but Interception law still
Workplace Surveillance Act 2005
commenced on October 7 2005.
The Act was proclaimed in the Government Gazette on 17 September. The
Workplace Surveillance Regulation 2005
was also gazetted on the same day.
The regulation prescribes the form of applications for covert surveillance
authorities and the
form of the authorities, and provides for reports to the
Minister on all such applications and authorities.
The new Act replaces the existing
Workplace Video Surveillance Act of
, which is now repealed, but also now extends to other forms of
surveillance, including of telephone calls and email.
The Commonwealth Attorney-General has brought to the attention of the NSW
Attorney General that under the
Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979
(‘the Interception Act’), there is a general prohibition against
the recording of a communication passing over a telecommunications
This includes the interception and recording of emails. If an
employer is intercepting incoming or outgoing emails without
the knowledge of
both the sender and receiver, the employer is likely to be committing an offence
under the Interception Act, even
if the terms of the
Workplace Surveillance Act
are being met and even if a covert surveillance authority has been granted by a
Magistrate. The
Workplace Surveillance Act
applies in relation to emails
that have ceased to pass over the telecommunications system and are stored, for
example, on an employer’s
computer server.
Some guidance on the new law is available through

Victorian draft workplace privacy law put forward as potential uniform
The Victorian Attorney-General has taken to the Standing Committee of
Attorneys-General (SCAG) the draft Workplace Privacy Bill included
in the final
report of the Victorian Law Reform Commission, launched in October 2005. SCAG
has commissioned further work on the idea
of uniform legislation, to be led by
the NSW Department. However, the Victorian Attorney, when launching the VLRC
Report, indicated
that the Victorian Government intended to legislate along the
lines of the draft Bill and would not allow inter-jurisdictional discussions
unreasonably delay this.
The VLRC Report concluded that there was a major gap in statutory privacy
protection left partly by the exemption of private sector
employee records from
the Commonwealth Privacy Act and partly by the limitation of privacy laws to
information privacy. The VLRC
recommends a comprehensive approach to the
protection of privacy of all employees, covering not only information privacy
forms of surveillance, tracking and testing. Comprehensive protection
requires rules in relation to the authorisation of surveillance
in the first
place, whether or not it results in the creation of a record of personal
information.
The draft Bill attached to the Report would create a tiered framework of
regulation – ranging from merely advisory codes through
mandatory codes
for certain surveillance activities to complete prohibition of others –
such as CCTV monitoring of toilets
and change rooms. All permitted surveillance
would be subject to general principles, and an independent regulator would
monitor and
enforce the law. However, unlike the NSW law, covert surveillance
would not require a magistrate’s approval, only compliance
mandatory code to be developed by the regulator.

In August 2005, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA)
published Privacy Guidelines for Broadcasters. The guidelines
say that they were
developed by ACMA’s predecessor, the Australian Broadcasting Authority
(the ABA) in consultation with the
broadcasting industry. And that in developing
the guidelines, the ABA had regard to past ABA investigations, case law, and
consideration
by other authorities and media regulators of key issues arising
from complaints about media intrusion into privacy. However, there
have been no consultation either with the public generally or with consumer
representatives, or even with the Privacy
Commissioners?

Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners
in Montreux,
Switzerland, have adopted a declaration calling not only for the spread of
also for cooperation with NGOs around
the world, for efforts at increasing the sharing of information on international
and for intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) to comply with such
principles and to appoint privacy officers.
The Montreux Declaration calls for heads of government meeting in Tunis in
November for the World Summit on the Information Society
to include in their
final declaration a commitment to develop or re-inforce a legal framework that
ensures the rights to privacy
and data protection to all citizens. It also calls
on the UN to prepare a legal binding legal instrument which clearly sets out in
detail the rights to privacy and data protection as enforceable human

Regulations provide for Centrelink Confirmation eService
Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 301), made on 15 December 2005 insert a new
exception to National Privacy Principle 7.2 (restriction
of private sector use
of Commonwealth Identifiers) in the
The new exception authorises the use and disclosure by 24
organisations of the Customer Reference Number assigned by Centrelink for
purpose of accessing the Centrelink Confirmation eService in order to determine
whether an individual is entitled to receive
a concession.
The 24 organisations listed are mostly private sector water, gas or
electricity utilities, but also include the St George Bank.
The use and disclosure of the Centrelink Customer Reference Number by each
private sector organisation is in each case only for the
benefit of the
individual concerned. It enables service providers to access Centrelink’s
Confirmation eService, with the customer’s
consent, and determine a
customer’s eligibility to concessional entitlements. This removes the need
for customers to go into
a Centrelink office to get proof of their eligibility
for these concessions. The verification occurs on-line in real time, providing
up to date eligibility information.

Victoria creates new Police data ombudsman in wake of LEAP database
In response to several serious breaches of security of the Law Enforcement
Assistance Programme (LEAP) database, maintained by Victoria
Police, the State
government has enacted special legislation establishing a new
‘watchdog’. The
Commissioner for Law Enforcement Data Security
creates the position of Commissioner for LEDS, who will be
responsible for setting standards, monitoring police compliance, and referring
any findings to other relevant bodies, including the Director of Police
Integrity and the Privacy Commissioner. While the new LEDS
Commissioner appears
to have wide powers, the Commissioner of Police can withhold information on a
wide range of grounds. The government
originally announced its intention to
cerate a new body to be responsible for the operation of the LEAP database, but
have retreated significantly from this strong initial response to the
security breaches. It remains to be seen how well resourced
and effective this
new watchdog will be.
Meanwhile, the Victorian Privacy Commissioner is conducting a Part 6
investigation into a specific breach of LEAP database security
earlier in 2005.
The Commissioner announced in December that he expects his report to be ready
for tabling in State Parliament in
February 2006. (see www.privacy.vic.gov.au
Major expansion of Financial Transaction Reporting proposed
The federal government has issued for consultation a draft exposure Bill
concerning Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing.
The government
argues that a major overhaul of the existing
Financial Transaction Reports Act
is required to meet obligations under international standards issued by the
Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF).
The draft legislation follows a lengthy consultation initiated in early 2004,
but mostly only with industry representatives, and represents
tranche’ of reforms, covering the financial sector. The consultation paper
foreshadows a second tranche of reforms
to impose obligations on other industry
sectors, including real estate agents, jewelers and professionals such as
accountants and
lawyers performing non-financial services.
Obligations under the new legislation, as under the existing FTRA, include
customer identification and reporting, but go significantly
further in both
respects. Much of the detail of implementation would be contained in AMF/CTF
Rules, to be issued by the Australian
Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre
(AUSTRAC), and draft rules are included in the consultation package.
Submissions are invited by 13 April 2006, and a range of consultation forums
will be held in the meantime.

ALRC to conduct major review of Privacy law
On 31 January 2006, the federal government announced a reference to the
Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) to review existing
Commonwealth, State
and Territory laws and practices and consider the needs of individuals for
technology. The ALRC will also examine
current and emerging international law in the privacy area and consider
community perceptions
of privacy and the extent to which it should be protected
by legislation.
The ALRC will consult widely, with at least two interim papers, before
reporting by 31 March 2008.
