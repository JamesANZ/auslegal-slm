rule 13.10(a)
Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001
(Cth), the amended application filed on 30 April 2021, as proposed to be

REASONS FOR
JUDGE DRIVER:
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1 By an Application in a Case filed on 17 May 2021,
the respondents seek the summary dismissal, under
rule 13.10(a)
Federal Circuit Court Rules 2001
(Cth) (Federal Circuit Court Rules), of
the applicant’s amended application filed on 30 April 2021. The applicant
having been
released from detention, the sole basis for his claim to substantive
relief is a claim in damages for wrongful imprisonment (the
entitlement to which
the respondents deny), together with prohibitive and declaratory relief (sought,
apparently, in aid of the claim
for wrongful imprisonment or to prevent an
apprehended further breach of duty in tort). Because Parliament has not
conferred jurisdiction
on this Court to hear claims in tort, the respondents
assert that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting
Visa status and procedural history
2 The applicant is a transitory person who was
brought to Australia for a temporary purpose under the former s 198C of the
Migration Act 1958
(Cth) (Migration
On or around 12 December
2020, the applicant requested in writing to be removed to Papua New
On 21 January 2021, the
applicant was granted a bridging visa and released from

that this Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the applicant’s
directed that the Commonwealth’s objection to jurisdiction be heard by way
of a separate hearing on 16 August 2021.
The applicant was required to file and
serve an amended application, which he duly did within the time prescribed. The
respondents
subsequently filed their Application in a Case on 17 May 2021, in
accordance with the Court’s orders.
4 The substantive application has been amended several times. On 2 August
2021, the Court received from the applicant a third further
amended application,
which substantially revised the orders sought and the substantive grounds of the
application. The applicant
would require leave to file the third further
amended application. I dealt with the matter on the basis that the third
further amended
application would be the form of application on which the
applicant would seek to rely if the summary dismissal application failed,
hence the summary dismissal application should be tested against that form of
the application.
Relief sought in the application as amended

amended application, the applicant
Orders sought by the applicant
1. Injunction restraining the respondents’ officers or agents from
removing the applicant from Australia pending the hearing
and determination of
these proceedings.
2. Injunction restraining the respondents from relying on their administration

carried out in accordance
3. Declaration that from 23 October 2019 the applicant no longer needed to be in

Migration Act
5. Declaration that the respondents owed a duty of care to the applicant to
limit the duration of the applicant’s detention
to that required for the
purpose of removal of the applicant to Papua New Guinea (PNG) as soon as
reasonably practicable either from
the time [the] applicant no longer needed to
be in Australia for the temporary purpose for which he had been brought to
or from the time of the applicant’s request for removal.
6. Declaration that each of the respondents’ failure to establish a system
for the assessment of the continued need of transitory
persons to remain in
Australia for the temporary purpose for which they brought to Australia under
former s 198C

(Cth), or to establish a system to
administer requests for return under s 198(1) of the Act, or to take steps to
remove the applicant
to PNG from either the end of his need to be in Australia
from 23 October 2019 for the temporary purpose, or from the time of his
for removal on 12 December 2020; up to the grant of a bridging visa on 1 March
2021, was in breach of the respondents’
duty of care to limit the
applicant’s detention.
7. Damages for breach of the duty of care, including aggravated and exemplary
damages for the length and remoteness of the extended
detention and the
resulting mental anguish and anxiety suffered by the applicant.

6 The grounds proposed to be advanced are:
Grounds of application
The respondents
1. The third respondent (Commonwealth) is capable of being sued by reason of
and/or 64 of the
Judiciary Act 1903
2. From 27 August 2018 to date, the Commonwealth departments responsible for the
administration of the
Migration Act 1958
(Cth) (the Act) were known as
the Department of Home Affairs and the Department of Immigration, Citizenship,
Migrant Services and
Multicultural Affairs (the Departments).
3. The Commonwealth is vicariously liable for the negligent acts and omissions
of its servants and agents, including officers and
employees of the Departments,
in relation to the detention of the applicant in the administration of the
The detention of the applicant
4. On 13 September 2013 the applicant arrived at Christmas Island by boat as an
unauthorised maritime arrival. On 9 October 2013
the Commonwealth took the
applicant to Manus Island, PNG, pursuant to s 198AD of the Act.
5. On 23 October 2015 the Government of PNG found the applicant to be a
Transfer to Australia
6. On 25 June 2019 the applicant arrived in Australia from PNG under former s
198C of the Act in force at the time (Compilation No.146)
6.1 On 4 June 2019 Nicola Jandura, National Justice Project, notified the
Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs on behalf of
the applicant’s
treating doctors that the applicant was a ‘relevant transitory
person’ within the meaning of former
s 198E(2) of the Act.
6.2 On 7 June 2019, a Medical Officer of the Commonwealth agreed that the
applicant required tertiary level psychiatric inpatient
management beyond the
level of care able to be provided by the Pacific International Hospital in Port
Moresby (the Temporary Purpose),
and as such agreed that the transfer of the
applicant to Australia would be appropriate.
7. On 14 June 2019, the second respondent approved the applicant’s
transfer from PNG to Australia for medical and psychiatric
treatment and
assessment, pursuant to s 198E of the former Act.
8. On 21 June 2019 in a document headed Agreement of Medical Transfer under the
letterhead of Australian Border Force (ABF) and countersigned
by an ABF officer,
the applicant expressed his understanding that:
8.1.1 the applicant’s transfer to Australia would be temporary for the
purpose only of receiving specialist medical treatment
which was not available
8.1.2 the applicant would be detained in an immigration detention facility in
Australia on the basis he was an unlawful non-citizen
whilst in Australia for
this temporary purpose;
8.1.3 the applicant would be escorted to and from the detention facility to
receive the medical treatment; and
8.1.4 once the applicant no longer needed to be in Australia for the medical
treatment and was assessed as fit to travel, he would
be transferred back to PNG
in accordance with Australian law.
9. At the same time, the ABF provided the applicant further information in
relation to his transfer to Australia in the documents
Information Sheet’ and ‘Property Management Information Sheet’
(other transfer information).
10. At the time of the Agreement of Medical Transfer the applicant was subject
to a direction made 15 July 2014 by the then Minister
for Immigration and Border
Protection under s 198AD(5) of the Act that the applicant would, as an
unauthorised maritime arrival who
had previously been taken to PNG and brought
to Australia as a transitory person for the temporary purpose of undertaking
treatment, be taken back to PNG when he no longer needed to be in
Australia for the medical treatment.
11. Upon the applicant’s arrival in Australia on 25 June 2019 the
applicant was detained under s 189 of the Act as an ‘unlawful
non-citizen’ within the meaning of that term in s 14 of the Act.
12. As an ‘unauthorised maritime arrival’, s 46A of the Act did not
permit the applicant to make a valid application
for a visa in Australia unless
the Minister decided under [s] 46A(2) that it was in the public interest to do
so. The Minister has
made no such decision.
Desinence of need to be in Australia for the temporary purpose
13. At least by 23 October 2019, the applicant no longer needed to be in
Australia for the temporary purpose for which he had been
Particulars
second respondent minister approved the transfer of the applicant to Australia
on the basis of a medical opinion from a Medical
Officer of the Commonwealth

arrival and throughout his detention the applicant was never admitted as an
30 June 2019 an International Health and Medical Services consultant
psychiatrist (IHMS psychiatrist) reported the applicant’s
psychiatric
disorder was drug induced and fully resolved with abstinence from
September 2019 the IHMS psychiatrist found no evidence of mental illness,
recommended the applicant cease mental health medications
and that an IHMS
mental health nurse carry out a review in one month and that if the applicant
was then stable he could be managed
with routine follow up.
October 2019, upon the recommended review, the IHMS mental health nurse reported
the applicant would self-refer if he required
mental health support, the
applicant having told her that he felt much better ceasing his
medication.
Request to return
14. On 12 December 2020 the applicant made a written request under s 198(1) of
the Act to be removed to PNG.
15. From the time the applicant was transferred to Australia on 25 June 2019 to
at least 16 February 2021 the respondents had not
established a system to
administer requests for return to regional processing countries by medevac
transferees such as the applicant.
16. Until the grant of a bridging visa on 1 March 2021 the respondents did not
take any steps to remove the applicant to PNG.
End of detention
17. The applicant was released from detention on 1 March 2021 upon the grant of
a 6 month Final Departure Bridging Visa E. The applicant
as an unauthorised
maritime arrival is barred by s 46A of the Act from making a valid application
for the extension of this visa.
18. The detention was done by the respondents.
Injunction restraining removal
19. The injunction is sought to prevent the removal of the applicant from
Australia before the hearing and determination of the remainder
proceedings.
Duty of Care
20. The harm to the applicant from his continued detention beyond either the end
of his need to be in Australia for the Temporary
Purpose, or from his request to
be removed on 12 December 2020, up to the time of his release on 1 March 2021,
was the loss of his
freedom and resulting serious mental harm. This harm was
foreseeable and known to the respondents.
21. The operation of ss 189 and 196 of the Act meant the applicant as an
unlawful non-citizen had no control over the duration of
his detention except
to request his own removal under s 198(1) of the Act that he be returned to PNG
or to commence legal proceedings
for mandamus.
22. The respondents assumed responsibility for the applicant’s detention
to end according to Australian law, which in the applicant’s
case was as
soon as reasonably practicable after the end of the applicant’s need to be
in Australia for the Temporary Purpose
(s 198AD(2)) or the date of his request
to be removed (s 198(1)); or upon the grant of a visa.
23. The respondents also assumed these responsibilities in the acceptance of the
understanding of the applicant of the matters set
out in the Agreement of
Medical Transfer dated 11 July 2019 and its notification of the other transfer
information.
24. As a person originally from Sudan whom the respondents took from Australia
to PNG as an unauthorised maritime arrival in 2013,
and who was held by the
respondents in closed detention in Australia since his transfer on 25 June 2019,
the applicant was vulnerable
in his dependency on the respondents for his very
existence during his detention, and lacked capacity to protect himself, his
as an unlawful non-citizen being lawful whether or not the respondents
acted as required by ss 198AD(2) or s 198(1) of the Act to
remove the applicant
as soon as reasonably practicable.
25. In the premises of:
25.1.1 the respondent’s knowledge of the harm of extended detention to the
applicant beyond either his need to be in Australia
for the temporary purpose or
his request for return;
25.1.2 the proximity of the relationship between the applicant as a lawfully
detained person and the respondents;
25.1.3 the dependence of the applicant on the respondents for his existence
while in detention;
25.1.4 the applicant’s reliance on the respondents to comply with their
statutory duties;
25.1.5 the applicant’s vulnerability in being unable to protect himself
against extended detention except by request for return
and legal action;
the respondents were under a duty of care to limit the duration of the
applicant’s detention to that required for the purpose
of removal of the
applicant to PNG as soon as reasonably practicable from 23 October 2019, being
the end of his need to be in Australia
for the Temporary Purpose, or otherwise
from [the] time of his request to be removed to PNG on 12 December 2020.
Breach of Duty
26. The respondents’ failure to establish a system for the assessment of
the need for transitory persons to remain in Australia
for the temporary purpose
for which they brought to Australia under former s 198C of the Act, or to
establish a system to administer
requests for return under s 198(1) of the Act,
or to take steps to remove the applicant to PNG from 23 October 2019, being the
of his need to be in Australia for the Temporary Purpose, or from 12
December 2020 being the time of his request to be removed, until
the grant of a
visa on 1 March 2021 11 December 2020, was in breach of the respondents’
duty of care to limit the applicant’s
27. The applicant claims:
27.1.1 Declarations that the respondents by conduct alleged in the Statement of
Claim have breached the duties of care owed to the
27.1.2 Damages for breach of the duties of care including aggravated and
exemplary damages;
27.1.3 Interest pursuant to
Federal Circuit Court of Australia
27.1.4 Costs.
Respondents’ submissions on jurisdiction
7 The Federal Circuit Court has only such original
legislation.
Accordingly, in order
to establish that this Court has jurisdiction to hear his application, the
applicant must identify a provision
of a statute or legislative instrument by
which jurisdiction is conferred on the Court to hear claims of the kind the
applicant seeks
to bring. For the reasons below, there is said to be no such
provision. It follows in the respondents’ submission that the
has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding, and his
amended application should be summarily
dismissed under
rule 13.10(a)
Federal Circuit Court Rules
Migration Act
8 The Federal Circuit Court’s jurisdiction
with respect to migration decisions is conferred by
Migration Act
(and subject to the qualifications in
Section 476(1)
Subject to this section,
Circuit Court
has the same original jurisdiction in relation to
as the High Court has under
Constitution
9 The jurisdiction of this Court is conferred “in relation to migration
decisions”. A cognate of that phrase appears
in s 476A, which follows
immediately after s 476 in the
Migration Act
Section 476A(1)
concerns the
original jurisdiction “in relation
to a migration decision” only if
one or more of the conditions in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) are met.
10 The High Court has held, in construing the meaning of the phrase “in
relation to a migration decision” as it appears
, that the phrase
is confined to “public law remedies in the nature of judicial review of
migration decisions”.
, Nettle J (sitting as a single judge) affirmed the position at [14]
that had, in his Honour’s words, “consistently been
taken in the
Federal Court”, namely, that
does not deny the Federal Court
of allegedly unlawful
detention under the
Migration Act
. The proper
construction of the phrase was explained in the following terms by Siopis J
Fernando v Minister for Immigration and
Citizenship
at [22] that the
phrase “in relation to migration decisions” in the context of
is to be read as if the words “an application for
judicial review of”, were inserted between the words “in relation
to” and “a migration decision”.
11 The reasoning for that construction of the
phrase “in relation to a migration decision” has been explained in
decisions of the Federal Court, a number of which were cited with
approval by Nettle J in
at [14]. It was explained most recently
by the Full Federal Court in
McHugh v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship,
Migrant Services and Multicultural
Allsop CJ, after
referring to Nettle J’s reasons in
, explained the
position to be as follows at [15]:
the phrase “jurisdiction in relation to a
migration decision” can be taken to be no wider than jurisdiction in
law remedies of direct judicial review of a migration decision. The
phrase “in relation to” has no width or flexibility
in this context
beyond that. It does
include what might be called collateral attack
upon a migration decision:
at [22], such as a claim for false
imprisonment available within jurisdiction under ss 39B(1A)(c) and
Constitution
by s 32(1) of the
Federal Court Act 1976
Operations Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia
(1998) 153 ALR 520
–[13]. See also
Commonwealth v Okwume
(2018) 263 FCR
356 ALR 290
160 ALD 515
[2018] FCAFC 69
(emphasis in original)
12 The other members of the Full Federal Court in
similar reasoning. Mortimer J stated at [247] that “the phrase ‘in
relation to a migration decision’ in
s 476A should be confined: first, to
public law remedies; and second, to ‘direct’ judicial review”.
Besanko J at
[74] agreed with Allsop CJ, stating:
I agree that the authorities identified in his
Honour’s reasons (at [15]) mean that the phrase “jurisdiction in
to a migration decision” can be taken to be no wider than
a migration
decision and, that the phrase “in relation to” has no width or
flexibility in this context beyond that.
13 The phrase “in relation to a migration decision” has been
given an equivalent construction in the context of
Migration Act
Section 486A
imposes a time limit for the making of an application to the High
Court “in relation to a migration decision”. The meaning
that phrase in the context of
was the subject of the High Court’s
Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural
at [15] and in the passage from
, the High Court expressly rejected a submission by the
Solicitor-General for the Commonwealth that the phrase “in relation
migration decision” was broad enough to encompass an application in tort
against the Commonwealth for false
imprisonment.
The High Court
observed at [22] that there were “cogent reasons why the phrase ‘a
remedy ... in relation to a migration
decision’ should not be given a
reading which would take
beyond public law remedies and into the area of
what might be called collateral attack upon migration decisions”.
14 The High Court’s construction of the phrase “in relation to a
migration decision” in
was subsequently applied by the
Full Federal Court to the construction of
Federal Court observed at [7] that, notwithstanding that
appeared in different parts of the
Migration Act
, “There is no relevant
difference... between
and Div 2 of
in relation to the issue of
construction”. The Full Federal Court held at [9] that “Div 2 of Pt
8 of the Act is confined
by the use of the expression ‘in relation to a
migration decision’ to applications for direct judicial review of
decisions and does not extend to ancillary judicial review proceedings
in respect of orders made in proceedings of that kind”.
15 As is apparent from the foregoing, the meaning of the phrase “in
relation to migration decisions” has been the subject
of detailed judicial
consideration, including in the context of provisions of the
Migration Act
confer or confine the jurisdiction of a court.
16 The respondents submit that, for the same reasons that the Federal Court
is no warrant for reading the phrase “in relation to migration
decisions” in
differently from the phrase “in relation to a
migration decision” in
To give those phrases inconsistent
meanings would be to depart from the basic principle of statutory construction
consistent meaning should ordinarily be given to a particular
term wherever it appears in a suite of statutory
provisions”.
No other statutory basis for jurisdiction
17 The respondents submit that there is no other
statutory basis on which this Court can grant the relief sought by the
18 It is said to be no answer to the jurisdictional objection (if such an
answer be proferred) that the Court is by s 18 of the Federal
Circuit Court
conferred with jurisdiction in “associated matters”.
Section 18 confers on the Court jurisdiction “in respect of
matters not
otherwise within its jurisdiction that are associated with matters” in
which its jurisdiction is invoked. As explained
above, the sole
for the relief sought by the applicant is the claim for tortious damages (and
declaratory relief sought in aid of that claim).
Accordingly, there is no
matter within
declaratory relief could be associated.
Extension of time
19 The applicant seeks “an order that the time
for making the amended application for damages for false imprisonment be
section 477
Migration Act 1958
”. Such an order does
not appear to be necessary, the amended application having been filed in
existing proceedings and with
the leave of the Court. At the hearing this was
accepted by the applicant and me.
Applicant’s submissions
20 Like the further amended application served on
the respondents on 15 July 2021 and referred to in the respondents’
submissions, and a proposed second further amended application, the
third further amended application seeks different tortious relief
sought in the amended application filed prior to the High Court’s decision
Commonwealth of Australia v
21 Tortious relief aside, the proceedings remain in part as they were
commenced, ie in the original jurisdiction of the Court “in
relation to
migration decisions”.
is not claimed that the Court’s authority to decide the tortious claim
arises as one “in relation to migration decisions”
, but from the Court’s accrued jurisdiction and its power
under s 14 of the Federal Circuit Court Act
22 The applicant agrees that the Court’s jurisdiction “in
relation to a migration decision” is confined to “public
remedies in the nature of judicial review of migration decisions”. However
this construction is said not to exclude the
Court’s accrued jurisdiction
in respect of the whole matter before the Court.
23 In this case the public law remedies of injunctive and declaratory relief
are sought in relation to two migration decisions set
out in the proposed third
further amended application:
(a) date of first decision: 23 October 2019 to 1 March
2021, being a failure to take the applicant as an unauthorised arrival to whom
Migration Act
applied from Australia to a regional processing
country as soon as reasonably
practicable;
(b) date of second decision: 12 December 2020 to 1 March 2021, being a failure
to remove the applicant as soon as reasonably practicable,
the applicant then
being an unlawful non-citizen who had asked the Minister in writing to be so
24 Each failure is said to be a “migration decision” under
Migration Act
, each falling within the description of the
“doing or refusing to do any other act or thing”.
25 Each failure is said to fall within the more general description in the
original application: “[f]ailure to remove, or to
take any reasonable
steps toward removal of the applicant to the relevant regional processing
country” in respect of which
the Court was originally seized of
26 The applicant contends that, while subsequent developments have seen the
applicant alter some of his claims for relief, the Court’s
has remained.
27 Following the grant of a visa to the applicant the public law relief of
mandamus for removal would no longer be available, there
being no unperformed
public duty to remove the applicant under either
as the applicant was
no longer in detention, or under
as the applicant was no longer an
non-citizen”.
28 After the filing of the amended application which included a claim for
tortious relief for illegal detention, the High Court handed
down its decision
The High Court there made clear at [48], [52] and [72]
that any failure by the executive in relation to “hedging duties”
(which makes up the “migration decisions” in these proceedings) did
not affect the legality of the detention.
29 As a result of
the applicant could not maintain his claim in
the amended application for the public law relief of prohibition in respect of
claimed illegality of detention said to arise from the same migration
decisions the subject of the later further amended applications.
Nor could the
applicant claim damages, as the respondents’ failure to comply with its
statutory duties under either
(1) had not rendered the
applicant’s detention unlawful.
30 However the applicant submits that
did not undermine the
applicant’s claim for the public law declaratory relief sought in both the
amended application and the
proposed further amended applications upon the
judicial review of the breaches of these “hedging duties”, ie the
decisions”.
The whole matter includes breaches of a duty of
31 The applicant contends that while the failure to
comply with the statutory hedging duties per se does not sound in
this failure sounds in
damages in negligence as they are also breaches of the duty of care owed to the
applicant to limit his detention
as pleaded in the further amended
applications.
32 Because of the factual identity between the breaches of statutory duty and
the breaches of the duty of care, remedies for each
of these independent actions
are available as arising from the same or the “whole” matter. The
former remedies are upon
judicial review of the migration decisions, the latter
upon adjudication of the legally independent (though factually associated)
tortious claim.
33 This Court’s jurisdiction to hear and determine the tortious claim
is therefore said to be the same pendent or “accrued”
of the High Court to make orders for the resolution of the “whole
matter” between the parties. As the High
Court stated in
It is settled doctrine in Australia that when a court
which can exercise federal jurisdiction has its jurisdiction attracted in
to a matter, that jurisdiction extends to the resolution of the whole
matter. This accrued federal jurisdiction is not limited to
matters incidental
to that aspect of the matter which has, in the first place, attracted federal
opinion, to the resolution of the whole matter
between the parties. This accrued jurisdiction carries with it the authority to
such remedial orders as are necessary or convenient for or in consequence
of that resolution. For this purpose, the court exercising
federal jurisdiction
may enforce rights which derive from a non-federal
34 The accrued jurisdiction of this Court was affirmed upon a survey of the
relevant authorities in
35 This “accrued” jurisdiction depends on the grant of an
authority to adjudicate rather than the law to be applied or
the subject of
adjudication. Non-federal law is part of the single, composite body of law
applicable to cases determined in the exercise
of federal jurisdiction, subject
to any statutory limitation on jurisdiction applying to a federal

38 The applicant does not contend that the tortious claim engages the
Court’s associated jurisdiction, it not being another
“associated” federal matter. The applicant agrees that s 18 of the
Federal Circuit Court Act
is not apposite to the jurisdictional issues
before the Court.

40 The applicant agrees that an extension of time to
claim the tortious relief is not required, but for different reasons to those
given by the respondents.
41 The time limits provided by
Migration Act
only apply to
remedies “to be granted in exercise of the court’s original
in relation to a migration decision”. As the
respondents observed in their submissions the phrase “in relation to a

judicial review of migration decisions. The phrase should not
be construed to
extend to other tortious relief sought in the accrued jurisdiction of the Court
or in exercise of the Court’s
powers under s 14 of the Federal Circuit

respondents. The applicant accepts, correctly, that

For the reasons that
follow, I reject that submission.
Relief sought by the applicant
43 In order to understand
the jurisdictional obstacle to the applicant’s claim, it is helpful to
begin with an evaluation of
the relief the applicant seeks in the proposed third
further amended application.
44 The substantive relief sought by the applicant is confined to a claim for
damages for breach of duty of care. That claim is reflected
in prayer 7 (but
numbered 8) in the proposed third further amended application. The applicant no
longer presses a claim for damages
associated with an alleged failure to comply
with the duties to remove under ss 198AD(2) and/or 198(1).
45 The balance of the relief sought by the applicant (aside from interest and
costs) can, in substance, only be sought in aid of the
tortious damages claim.
Specifically:
(a) the injunctive relief sought by prayer 1 appears to
be directed to preserving the subject matter of these proceedings, rather
based on any independent claim to final relief. In any event, the relief sought
is inapt, for the applicant’s (putative)
ability to recover damages is
unaffected by whether or not he is removed (and is, in this respect, a step
removed from an equivalent
order that might be sought in an application for
habeas corpus
(b) the so-called injuctive relief sought by prayer 2 is, in substance,
declaratory in nature: it is directed at a finding that,
at a time when the
applicant was detained, the respondents did not give effect to the obligations
under ss 198AD(2) and/or 198(1);
(c) similarly, the declaratory relief sought by prayers 3 and 4 is directed at a
finding that, at a time when the applicant was detained,
the respondents did not
give effect to the duty under s 198AD(2); and
(d) the declaratory relief sought by prayers 5 and 6 is expressly framed as
tortious relief: namely, a putative duty to limit the
duration of the
applicant’s detention (prayer 5) and an alleged breach of that duty
(prayer 6).
46 As the applicant properly acknowledges, now that he has been released from
detention, a writ of mandamus is not available to compel
performance of any
unperformed duty under s 198AD(2) or 198(1).
47 Divorced from prayers 7 or 8, the relief sought
by prayers 1 to 6 is entirely hypothetical. The Court would not grant relief
to do so would produce no foreseeable
consequence.
The power to grant
declaratory relief is in this respect “confined by the considerations that
mark out the boundaries of judicial
No accrued jurisdiction
48 Against that background, it is apparent that the
applicant’s reliance on the notion of “accrued jurisdiction”
is misplaced. The term “accrued jurisdiction” denotes the
circumstances in which a federal court may exercise jurisdiction
with respect to
non-federal law.
Its operation
is exemplified by this Court’s decision in
Waters & Durrant
which this Court held that it had jurisdiction to hear a claim under the
Transfer of Land Act 1958
(Vic). In contrast, the present case is not a
case in which the court is asked to apply non-federal law in order to determine
whole of the federal matter before it.
49 The concept of “accrued jurisdiction” reflects the
“settled doctrine that when a court which can exercise federal
Put another way:
“[w]here federal and non-federal claims comprise the same justiciable
controversy, a court exercising federal
resolve the entire matter in the exercise of its federal
premise of the concept of “accrued jurisdiction” is that
“non-federal law is part of the single, composite
body of law applicable
alike to cases determined in the exercise of federal jurisdiction and to cases
determined in the exercise
of non-federal
50 It is “obvious” that “there can be no accrued
to entertain”.
51 Accordingly, the notion of “accrued jurisdiction” does not
assist the applicant unless he can first establish that
this Court has
provision by which jurisdiction is conferred.
The applicant accepts that there
is no cause of action in damages for breach of any alleged failure to comply
with a statutory duty.
the applicant appears to rely on the availability, generally, of remedies for
the “judicial review of... migration
decisions”. However, the
applicant does not seek such relief in these proceedings, other than such relief
as would give effect
to the tortious damages claim (and would, absent that
claim, be inutile).
explained above, the only (putative) legal basis for the applicant’s claim
to relief is a claim in negligence. The jurisdiction
to hear such a claim is
not “accrued”, because there is no federal matter that the Court
otherwise has jurisdiction to
52 That position is unaltered by the passage from Edelman J’s reasons
at [13], which merely confirms the uncontroversial proposition
that the reference in s 476(1) to the jurisdiction conferred on the

thereby grant relief. Rather, s 14 reflects a legislative prescription

that the Court lacks jurisdiction to deal with the application as proposed to be
