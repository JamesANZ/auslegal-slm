Churchill Park Golf Club [1998] VADT 19 (23 November 1998)
VICTORIAN CIVIL & ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL
ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LIST
Exemption No. 116 of 1998
IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION FOR EXEMPTION
CHURCHILL PARK GOLF CLUB
REASONS FOR DECISION ON THE APPLICATION
23 November 1998
Ms Angela Kominos
Ms Jan King
The proceeding
Mr Ashley Greeves, the Secretary/Manager of the Churchill Park Golf Club
("the Club") has sought an exemption of any discrimination
case against the Club
that would arise in the forthcoming elections.
The legislation
The Tribunal now sets out the provisions of the Act permitting it to grant
exemptions:
Discrimination against club
A club, or a member of the committee of management or
other governing body of a club, must not discriminate against a member of the
by refusing, or failing to accept, the
member's application for a different category or type of
membership;
by denying or limiting access to
any benefit provided by the club;
the terms of membership
by depriving the
member of membership
by subjecting the
member to any other detriment.
83. Exemptions by the
(1) The Tribunal, by notice published in the Government Gazette, may grant
an exemption-
) from any of the provisions of this Act in relation to-
(i) a person or class of people; or
(ii) an activity or class of activities; or
) in the circumstances referred to in section 28; or
) from any other provisions of this Act in any other circumstances
specified by the Tribunal.
(2) An exemption remains in force for the period, not exceeding 3 years, that
is specified in the notice
The Tribunal's power to grant exemptions
The Club has been in existence for approximately 27 years and was
incorporated in 1985. The Club is located at the Dandenong police
paddocks in
Endeavour Hills. The Club leased the land being crown land in the Dandenong City
Council. In recent times this situation
has altered by virtue of the fact Parks
Victoria is now responsible for the land.
The Anti-Discrimination List will not exercise its discretion unnecessarily.
"If conduct is clearly not covered by the Act, whether
because it clearly does
not constitute discrimination, does or does not fall within an area about which
the Act makes provisions
or comes within one of the statutory exceptions, there
is no need for the Board to exempt the conduct. It is necessary for an applicant
for exemption to show that there is at least an arguable case that the
circumstances might constitute discrimination to which the
Act would apply. If
this is shown, the Board will then ask; is the exemption appropriate in the
light of the objections and scheme
of the Act?"
re Fernwood Fitness
([1996] EOC 92-782). Issues as to reasonableness of the exemption
sought must also be considered.
The Anti-Discrimination List cannot interfere with the rules of the Club. In
this case the rules allow for two male and two female
members of the Club to
stand for the Board of Management.
The material before the Tribunal
The rules of the Club set out member eligibility, office bearers, and who
should be on the Board of Management. It is the rule relating
to the Board of
Management which has given rise to this application by Mr Greeves.
Members eligible as Officers of Members of the Board
Members eligible to be elected as an
Officer or Director of the Board of the Club shall be Life Members, financial
Full Members, financial
Intermediate Members, financial Weekday Members,
financial Youth Full Members, and financial Youth Intermediate Members, provided
that the total number of such Members, comprises at least forty per centum of
the total Membership of the Club, excluding temporary
Members, Honorary Members
and Junior Members.
Where the total number
of such Life, Full, Intermediate, Weekday and Youth Members does not comply with
the requirements of this rule,
every financial member of the General Body of
Members of the Club shall be entitled to be elected as an Officer or to the
The Officers of the Club shall consist of a
President, Vice President, Club Captain and a Finance Director elected from the
members as described in Rule 30 hereof.
The Board of the Club shall be the Officers
mentioned in Rule 31 hereof and five (5) Directors, at least two (2) of whom
male and at least two (2) of whom shall be female, from the eligible
Members as described in Rule 30 hereof.
Mr Greeves gave evidence the next elections will take place on Saturday 21
November 1998. There are two retiring members of the Board,
one male and one
female. There are four candidates for the elections on Saturday two men and two
women. The exemption is being sought
to prevent any legal action from the result
of the election in the event the two male members poll a greater number of votes
either of the women. Currently, there are 71 female and 400 male members of
the Club. The rules were created to give effect not only
to proportional
representation of the members but also to comply with appropriate equal
opportunity legislation.
Upon the oral evidence of Mr Greeves, and taking into consideration issues of
public interest it seems appropriate that female and
male members are
represented on the Board of Management by allowing for equal representation of
the genders, it eliminates one gender
dominating in number over the other
Therefore the exemption is granted pursuant to Section 60 of the
Opportunity Act 1995
in order to allow the Club and its Board of Management to
take all action necessary to implement its rules.
Dated this 23rd day of November 1998.
