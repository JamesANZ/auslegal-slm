DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL
On 22 July 2011, the Tribunal decided to set aside the decision under review
and substitute its decision that the amount of $10,317
is not to be credited
against Mr Caine’s child support liability.
DATE OF DESPATCH
4 August 2011
REASONS FOR DECISION
Caine and Mr Caine are the parents of Nigel, born 1998. Nigel lives with Ms
Caine. A child support assessment has been in place
since 21 November 2007. On 5
August 2009, Ms Caine applied for collection of child support and for collection
of three months arrears
by the Child Support Agency (the CSA) and the CSA made a
determination giving effect to the applications.
23 November 2010, Mr Caine provided the CSA with a spreadsheet of payments of
Nigel’s school fees made by him for the period
from 5 August 2009. He
stated that it appeared that not all of the payments had been credited by the
CSA. He also provided information
Nigel’s computer that had been made by him. Mr Caine requested the CSA to
and ensure that the correct amounts had been credited against his
fortnightly child support payments during the period in question.
be paid by Mr Caine under a court order. She did
not believe those payments
should be credited.
4 March 2011 a CSA officer decided to credit the amount of $10,371 paid by Mr
Caine towards Nigel’s 2010 school fees as prescribed
non-agency payments.
7 March 2011, Ms Caine lodged an objection to the decision with the CSA.
5 May 2010, an objections officer disallowed Ms Caine’s objection. In
reaching this decision the objections officer referred
to a copy of
Minutes of Consent Orders as to Property Settlement
signed by Ms Caine and
Mr Caine and filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on 22 January 2011. In
addition to the consent orders the
document contained a number of notations
including notation M, which provided:
The husband agrees to pay
the school fees for the child Nigel at a private school for 2010. In so
agreeing, he does not admit any
liability to pay for Nigel’s school fees
at that school thereafter and his liability to pay in ensuing years shall depend
the absence of agreement between the parties), upon the equity of his doing
so as determined by the Child Support Agency or the Court.
objections officer observed that notation M was not an order. She stated that
although it indicated Mr Caine’s intention
to pay Nigel’s school
fees for 2010 it was not an order and could not vary the (child support)
assessment. She said that the
payments made by Mr Caine met the criteria for
acceptance as prescribed non-agency payments, which she listed as:
the payments for
school fees were of the kind specified in Regulation 5D (of the
Child Support
(Registration and Collection) Regulations 1988
at the time the
payments were made Mr Caine had less than 14% care of Nigel;
notation M of
the court order did not prevent Mr Caine from seeking credit under section 71C
Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988
the CSA had no
reason under
section 71D
(of that Act) to refuse the application.
18 May 2011, Ms Caine applied to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (the
Tribunal) for a review of the decision.
issue to be determined by the Tribunal is whether the payments made by Mr Caine
towards Nigel’s school fees for 2010 should
be credited towards the
enforceable maintenance liability.
DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
Tribunal had access to the Subsection 95(3)
Child Support (Registration and
Collection) Act 1988
Statement and Documents file provided by the Agency.
INFORMATION PROVIDED AT HEARING
The following is a summary of the information given by Ms Caine and Mr
Caine at the hearing. It is not a transcript.
Ms Caine’s Evidence
Caine told the Tribunal that the decision was wrong because the whole purpose of
going to court in January 2011 was for the property
settlement, not maintenance.
feels strongly about the decision. Nigel is suffering from a number of
conditions and he requires extra care, including seeing
a specialist and taking
medication.
Caine now has to meet the costs of all of these things.
is now attending a public school. He hated the private school. Now he is at the
top of his class and seeing a specialist.
Caine said she has not yet paid Nigel’s public school fees for this year
of $600. Nigel’s father won’t pay. She
has paid for Nigel’s
uniform and his pack. She noted that due to his medical condition Nigel needs
particular items.
said that she is on income support and the decision has placed her under
financial stress.
Caine said she had understood that the court proceedings in January 2011 were
totally separate to child support. She understood
that Mr Caine had agreed to
pay Nigel’s school fees for 2010 but nothing else.
Caine said she was concerned that she was told by the CSA first of all that the
payment of Nigel’s school fees for 2010 would
not be accepted as
prescribed non-agency payments and later that decision was changed.
Mr Caine’s evidence
Caine said that notation M in the court orders was not an order. It was a
notation. Notation M was added by him after the property
settlement was
completed. He wanted it recognised that he was prepared to pay the school fees
for Nigel for 2010. Ms Caine was not
contributing towards Nigel’s school
fees and he had thought it would be terrible for Nigel’s welfare if he
were unable
to attend the private school.
said there was no discussion about the inclusion of notation M. (The Tribunal
asked Ms Caine to respond to this statement. She
said there was discussion about
notation M. She said she sat down with her sibling and her solicitor to consider
the notation before
signing the consent orders).
Tribunal asked Mr Caine how he thought his payment of 2010 school fees would
affect his child support. He indicated that his intention
had been that his
payment of school fees would affect child support. He said he had continuously
asked the CSA in the past to accept
his payment of school fees as non-agency
Caine told the Tribunal that his payments of child support were up to date
except for the arrears arising from CSA’s decision
to accept Ms
Caine’s application for three months arrears, which he noted had been
subject to a review by this Tribunal (differently
constituted). He is paying
those arrears by instalments.
DISCUSSION OF EVIDENCE
section 95(3) documents do not contain copies of receipts for the payments
claimed by Mr Caine as payment of school fees for Nigel
in 2010. A copy of a
school invoice at folio 77 confirms some payments and a handwritten notation on
the document appears to record
some other payments made. Mr Caine has stated
that the payments were made and Ms Caine has not asserted that the payments were
made. The Tribunal understands that while Ms Caine considers the claimed
payments totalling $10,371 should not have been credited
as prescribed
non-agency payments, she accepts that the payments were made. In these
circumstances the Tribunal accepts that Mr Caine
paid a total amount of $10,371
to the private school as payment of school fees for 2010 for Nigel and that the
payments were as recorded
by the CSA in the decision notices of 4 March 2011
(folios 37 to 40).
Caine told the Tribunal that notation M to the orders filed in the Federal
Magistrates Court on 22 January 2010 was added by him
after the property
settlement was completed and that there was no discussion about the inclusion of
the notation. Ms Caine told the
Tribunal that she discussed the notation with
her sibling and her solicitor. The Tribunal is unable to determine whether there
discussion between the parties about the effect of notation M before they
signed the minutes of order.
Tribunal agrees with the parents and the objections officer that notation M is
not an order and that it cannot be used to vary
the child support assessment.
Notation M is an indication of the intention of the parties who signed the short
minutes of order,
that is, Ms Caine and Mr Caine.
Tribunal takes notation M to acknowledge an agreement by Mr Caine to pay for
Nigel’s school fees at the private school for
2010 only. The Tribunal
takes the notation to mean that Mr Caine would pay the school fees for 2010
without regard to his child support
liability but payment for future years would
be have to be determined with regard to his child support liability.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Caine is the person liable to pay child support to Ms Caine for Nigel.

payments were made to the private school as school fees for Nigel for 2010.
Caine is recorded as having less than regular care of Nigel from 1 July 2008.
M to court orders filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on 22 January 2011
indicated that that Mr Caine would pay Nigel’s
school fees for 2010
without regard to his child support liability but payment for future years would
be have to be determined with
regard to his child support liability.
APPLICATION OF LAW AND REASONS
section 71C of the
Child Support (Registration & Collection) Act 1988
(the Act), if the payer of an enforceable maintenance liability who does not
have regular care of any of the children of the assessment,
has made one or more
payments specified in Regulation 5D of the
Child Support (Registration &
Collection) Regulations 1988
(the Regulations), to the payee or to another
person, the Registrar must credit the payment or payments against the amount
under the payer’s liability.
4 of the Act gives meaning to certain terms found in section 71C of the Act.
enforceable maintenance
’ means a registered maintenance liability enforceable under
registered maintenance liability
registrable liability under section 17, 17A, 18 or 18A registered under the Act.
71C payments cannot be credited against an enforceable maintenance liability
that arose because of a maintenance liability
that was registered either under
section 17A, 18 or 18A of the Act. The Tribunal is satisfied that the
enforceable maintenance liability
to which the payments relate was not
registered under section 17A, 18 or 18A of the Act.
speaking to Ms Caine and Mr Caine, the Tribunal is satisfied that the payments
that are the subject of this application were
actually made.
payments claimed by Mr Caine were for Nigel’s school fees for 2010 to the
private school. One of the specified payments
under Regulation 5D of the
Regulations is “fees charged by a school or pre-school” for the
child who is the subject of
the enforceable maintenance liability. After
speaking to Ms Caine and Mr Caine, the Tribunal is satisfied that the payments
are the subject of this application were of a type that is specified under
Regulation 5D(b).
Tribunal considers that the payments, totalling $10,371 made by Mr Caine for
Nigel’s school fees for 2010, met the requirements
to be credited against
the amount payable under Mr Caine’s child support liability of section 71C
of the Act.
71C is expressed to be subject to section 71D of the Act, which gives the
Registrar, or, on review, the Tribunal acting in
the place of the Registrar, the
discretion to refuse to credit an amount if satisfied that in the circumstances
of the particular
case, the amount ought not be credited.
this case, the objections officer considered that the CSA had no reason to
refuse to credit the amount of $10,371. The Tribunal
does not agree and
considers that in the circumstances of the case the amount ought not be
credited. In reaching this view the Tribunal
had regard to notation M to the
orders filed on 22 January 2011. The Tribunal considers that the notation
indicates that Mr Caine’s
payment of Nigel’s school fees for any
year after 2010 would be subject to his child support liability. The notation
no such intention in relation to his payment of school fees for 2010.
Tribunal considers that it would be unreasonable to credit the amounts paid for
Nigel’s school fees for 2010 against Mr
Caine’s child support
liability after he expressed the intention to pay those fees without the
payments being subject to his
child support liability.
Tribunal therefore determines that the discretion in section 71D of the Act
should be exercised to refuse to credit the amount
of $10,371 against Mr
Caine’s child support liability.
On 22 July 2011, the Tribunal decided to set aside the decision under review
and substitute its decision that the amount of $10,371
is not to be credited
against Mr Caine’s child support liability.
