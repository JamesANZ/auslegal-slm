REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is an application referred to the Tribunal by the Chief Executive Office of Fair
Trading under the
Agents and Motor Dealers Act
(“the Act”). It is a claim by Paul Tudor (“the
first applicant”) against the claim fund established under
the Act. The
first applicant alleges that he suffered financial loss because of the conduct
of O’Neill Holdings Group Pty
Ltd and Robert J O’Neill.
first applicant attended the directions hearing on 5 October 2009, but was not
able to attend the hearing today because of work
commitments. He requested that
it proceed in his absence and the outcome be advised to him.
respondents did not attend the directions hearing or file any material as
ordered. The respondents did not attend the hearing
today. I am satisfied that
they were given notice of the hearing and I intend to proceed in their
first applicant relies on the material contained in the file of the Office of
Fair Trading, which is in evidence before the Tribunal.
That material sets out
the background to the claim.
6 November 2007 the first applicant provided his Subaru Impreza WRX registered
number 977-JJD (“the vehicle”) to the
respondents, for it to be sold
on consignment.
vehicle was to be sold for between $13,000.00 and $14,000.00 with a transaction
fee payable of $1,000.00. The first applicant
then left Australia to live and
work in Singapore where he remains. On14 November 2007 without the knowledge of
the first applicant
the vehicle was wholesaled to another
respondents did not provide to the first applicant the value of the vehicle. On
22 November 2007 the first applicant was told
that the vehicle had sold for the
sum of $13,500.00 and that he was to receive the sum of $12,500.00.
November and December 2007 the first applicant tried to contact the second
respondent on numerous occasions. On 5 December 2007
an amount of $5,000.00 was
deposited to the account of the first applicant. On 12 December 2007 a
subsequent deposit of $2500.00
to his account was dishonoured. The first
respondent continued to try to contact the second respondent, but to no avail.
respondent became aware of his loss on 25 January 2008 and made a
claim on the claim fund on 22 May 2008.
Legislation
of the Act states:
470 Restriction on recovery of reward or
expense—no proper authorisation etc
(1) A person may make a claim against the fund if the person suffers
financial loss because of the happening of any of the following
(e) a stealing, misappropriation or misapplication by a relevant person
of property entrusted to the person as agent for someone
else in the person's
capacity as a relevant person.”
is clear from the facts that the first applicant entrusted the vehicle to the
respondents who have failed to account to him for
its value. The second
respondent was a licensee and a relevant
respondent was not licensed, but acted as a licensee and comes within the
definition of licensee and is a relevant
evidence satisfies me that the respondents, as relevant persons, have stolen,
misappropriated or misapplied property entrusted
to them by the first applicant.
The worth of the vehicle was agreed between $13,000.00 and $14,000.00. The mid
point of that range
is an acceptable assessment of the value of the vehicle.
That is the amount for which the first respondent was told on 22 November
that the vehicle was
am satisfied that because of the respondents’ conduct the first applicant
has suffered financial loss in the amount of $7,500,
(appropriate sale
price/value of the vehicle $13,500.00, less part payment of $5,000.00 and less
transaction fee of $1,000.00). In
addition the first applicant has expended
legal fees in an endeavour to recover his financial loss. He is entitled to
recover that
amount also. The amount allowed is the sum of $2,193.72 which is
the amount payable by the respondents pursuant to default judgments
against them.
first applicant’s claim against the claim fund is allowed in the sum of
persons who are liable for the first applicant’s financial loss are the
respondents O’Neill Holdings Group Pty Ltd
and Robert John O’Neill.
first applicant’s claim against the fund is allowed in the sum of
persons liable for the first applicant’s financial loss are O’Neill
Holdings Group Pty Ltd and Robert John O’Neill.
