REASONS FOR DETERMINATION
INTRODUCTION
1. This application has been brought by the
Motor Accidents Insurance Board (“the Board”) for dismissal of a
to the Tribunal for want of prosecution pursuant to Regulation 15 of
the Motor Accidents Compensation Tribunal Regulations 2009 (“the
Regulations”).
2. The background to this application can
be summarised as follows:
• On 15 September 2016 the respondent to this
application, Xanna Weavell, was injured in a single vehicle motor accident. Her
young daughter was killed in the accident, as was the driver of the vehicle,
Alexander Peart, who was also the father of Ms Weavell’s
• By an application dated 25 November 2016, Ms Weavell
applied to the Motor Accidents Insurance Board for scheduled benefits
basis that she was a dependent of Mr Peart at the time of the
• The Board did not accept that Ms Weavell was a dependent of
Mr Peart and consequently declined to pay scheduled benefits,
in the form of a
lump sum payable as a death benefit, to Ms Weavell.
• By referral to
the Tribunal dated 7 April 2017, Ms Weavell referred to the Tribunal the
question of her entitlement to payment
of a lump sum in respect of her claim for
scheduled benefits as a death benefit.
• The referral was listed for a
teleconference on 21 April 2017, but the day before the scheduled teleconference
the solicitors
for Ms Weavell and for the Board requested an adjournment of the
teleconference for a period of time to enable Ms Weavell to comply
request for discovery which had been made on behalf of the Board.
referral was relisted for teleconference on 8 June 2017. The teleconference was
adjourned further at the request of the
parties because they were waiting for
provision of documentation from Centrelink. The same thing happened when the
teleconference
was relisted for 3 July 2017.
• Issues arose between the
parties as to provision of certain documents from Centrelink, which led to an
application from the
Board for a directions hearing. The directions hearing was
listed on 16 August 2017, but the Board’s application was ultimately
withdrawn on 24 August 2017.
• By letter to the Tribunal dated 13
September 2017 Ms Weavell’s solicitors requested the Tribunal set the
matter down
for a pre-hearing conference with a view to listing the matter for
hearing. The pre-hearing conference was listed for 29 September
2017, and prior
to that time the parties were offered tentative hearing dates in October 2017
and November 2017.
• A hearing date was allocated in November 2017, but
at a further pre-hearing conference on 25 October 2017 Ms Weavell’s
counsel foreshadowed that the applicant would not be in a state to proceed with
the hearing as scheduled. This was confirmed by
letter of 6 November 2017, and
by consent the parties requested that the matter stand adjourned and be listed
for teleconference
• At a teleconference on 29 March 2018 Ms
Weavell’s representative indicated that he was without instructions and
his firm would be discontinuing acting on behalf of Ms
• By email dated 28 June 2018 the solicitors for the Board
requested that the matter be relisted for hearing before the Tribunal
teleconference was scheduled for 24 July 2018.
• Notice of the
teleconference, which had been sent to the last known address of Ms Weavell, was
returned to the Tribunal, and
the Tribunal was unable to contact her by
telephone at the date and time of the hearing. The solicitor for the Board
applied for
the referral to be listed for hearing in the absence of Ms Weavell,
or in the alternative for a final determination of the referral
to be made on
the documents that had been filed in the Tribunal.
teleconference was adjourned until 16 August 2018, at which time I indicated to
the solicitor for the Board that I was
not prepared to list the matter for
hearing in the absence of Ms Weavell, but was prepared to hear the Board’s
application
for the referral to be dismissed on the papers or in person. The
Board’s solicitor was instructed to proceed with an application
on the papers which would be filed in the Tribunal.
• The Board’s
application was received on 23 November 2018, and it is that application that is
before the Tribunal now.
THE TRIBUNAL’S POWERS
3. Pursuant to s28(2) of the
Motor Accidents (Liabilities & Compensation) Act 1973 (“the
MALCA”) a person aggrieved
by a refusal or failure of the Board to make a
payment by way of a scheduled benefit may refer the matter to the Tribunal.
to sub-section (4) of the same section, the Tribunal shall make such
determination on a matter referred to it as it considers proper
circumstances.
4. S28(8) of the MALCA provides that regulations made for the
purposes of this section may prescribe the manner in which any determination
the Tribunal is to be made.
5. Regulation 15 of the Regulations provides
“a reference may be discontinued or dismissed for want of prosecution in
with the practice applicable in the Supreme Court for the
discontinuance or dismissal for want of prosecution of an
Supreme Court Rules 2000
(Tas) do not specifically
provide for dismissal of an action where there is want of prosecution, however
it is recognised that the
Supreme Court has an inherent jurisdiction to do so
where appropriate. An application to dismiss for want of prosecution was
by Cox CJ in Argo Pty Ltd & Ors v Attorney-General for Tasmania
[2000] TASSC 109
, and which was upheld on appeal in Attorney-General & Anor
v Argo Pty Ltd & Ors
[2001] TASSC 70
where Blow J (as he then was) noted at
paragraph 24 –
guiding principle for the exercise of a discretion to dismiss an action for want
of prosecution is that such an order will
be made if the justice of the occasion
demands it......the power to dismiss an action for want of prosecution exists as
part of the
general or inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and has not been
conferred by any statute or rule of court. The discretion is thus
not fettered
by any legislative restriction, but it must be exercised in accordance with
principles that have been developed by the
common law.......the principles
governing the exercise of the discretion that have been developed are
guidelines, rather than binding
rules of law......the discretion must be
exercised judicially after taking into account all the circumstances of the
case. Particular
factors that should be taken into account are the length of
the delay, the nature of any explanation given for the delay, and any
to the defendants that has arisen or might arise as a result of the
CONSIDERATION
7. As will be obvious from the background set
out above, Ms Weavell filed her referral in the Tribunal on or about 7 April
after the discovery process was attended to over the next six months
or so, Ms Weavell’s solicitors requested an appointment
Tribunal for a pre-hearing conference with a view to having the matter listed
for hearing. It appears from the Tribunal’s
file that the matter was
ready to proceed to hearing from the end of September 2017, but the impediment
to the hearing taking place
was the difficulty Ms Weavell’s solicitor had
encountered in contacting her, leading him to advise the Tribunal by 29 March
2018 that he had been unable to contact his client, and was consequently without
instructions.
8. The applicant Board maintains that it has been ready to
proceed to hearing since September 2017, and the delay rests solely upon
shoulders of Ms Weavell.
9. It has been submitted that if Ms Weavell’s
referral is not dismissed for want of prosecution, the Board will experience
in that it will not be able to finalise the referral, but will have no
way of moving forward. It has also been submitted that there
prejudice to Ms Weavell as it remains open to her to make application to the
Tribunal again for a further period of time
(up to five years from the date of
the accident pursuant to
of Schedule 1 of the Motor Accidents
(Liabilities & Compensation) Regulations
DETERMINATION
10. Having instructed her solicitor to institute
proceedings to have the Tribunal review the Board’s refusal to pay
benefits by way of death benefit, Ms Weavell appears to have failed to
maintain contact with her solicitor or to provide either her
solicitor or the
Tribunal with information to enable contact to be made. I accept the submission
that the responsibility for the
delay in proceeding with the referral rests
wholly on Ms Weavell, and I accept also that the Board has suffered prejudice,
it has incurred legal costs in having its solicitors attend a number of
appointments before the Tribunal over the last 18 months
whilst attempts were
made to contact Ms Weavell and have her referral moved towards a
11. In the absence of what appears to be any intention by Ms Weavell
to participate in the referral that she initiated, I accept that
the Board is
likely to continue to suffer prejudice by way of further legal costs if the
reference continues to remain in apparent
limbo. Accordingly, it is appropriate
that the Board’s application for dismissal for want of prosecution is
12. I order that Ms Weavell’s reference to the Tribunal for
scheduled benefits be dismissed.
