Lamb, Terrence v Queensland Thoroughbred Racing Board
[2002] QRAA 19
REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr L Williams AO – Chairman

Queensland Thoroughbred Racing Board to grant him a stablehand’s
Lamb has had various criminal convictions ranging from drunk driving to
driving without a licence. He is also the subject of an apprehended
order in respect of a former partner.
Lamb is presently unemployed. He is working for the dole to rehabilitate
himself. He is a former trainer and is anxious to take a
The Licensing Committee of the Queensland Thoroughbred Racing Board refused
Lamb’s application and deferred it for 12 months
until the second half of
2003. By the end of January next year if Lamb does not re-offend it will have
been 12 months since he had
previously been in trouble.
In the past whether negligently or wilfully he has not been entirely
forthright with the Stewards in respect of disclosure of his
offences. He claims
he now understands his obligations.
In all the circumstances the Authority believes it would be fair to direct
the Queensland Thoroughbred Racing Board to rehear Lamb’s

Thoroughbred Racing Board is in any way
obliged to decide one way or the other
on Lamb’s application but merely to consider it at that time.
