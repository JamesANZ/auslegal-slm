In examining the extent to which executive power has been judicially coloured
in light of ‘recent

unorthodox shift from literalism’s formidable reign. The High Court in the
Williams judgments appeared to ‘muddy’
the relatively settled waters
of constitutional interpretation; a system that (until then) had been left
relatively undisturbed.
On its face, the shift was provocative, tempting one to
question the extent to which the Williams judgments have and will continue
revolutionise the interpretive framework of the Commonwealth
Constitution
However, a closer examination of the judicial reasoning indicates that at this
stage there is little cause for concern. The nature
allows the Williams
methodology to be contained to executive power alone, and rightly so. As such,
pro-federalist considerations
seem to have rediscovered a place in
constitutional interpretation—one now capable of co-existence with the
otherwise preserved
literalist status quo.

II ENGINEERS: A BRIEF REFLECTION
To magnify the significance of the
approach, it is imperative
to briefly recount the High Court’s approach to constitutional
interpretation as at federation. Until
the Commonwealth
Constitution
was read in light of contemporary federal
considerations
namely, the doctrines of reserved State powers and
implied immunity of instrumentalities
respectively preserving
residual State powers and
sovereignty.
However, this
practice was short lived and subsumed in

Pursuant to its broad submission, the Commonwealth proposed an essentially

cease after appropriation, it could continue
to exert control where expenditure
