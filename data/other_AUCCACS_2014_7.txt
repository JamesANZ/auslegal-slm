The offence
The offender was released

their seven month old son[8]. Ms Latimer, the
defendant’s de facto partner, leased a duplex home unit with the adjoining
occupied by a woman and her young sister.[7]
On 1 August 2013 while
Ms Latimer was elsewhere the offender packed his belongings into garbage
bags.[9] Text messages were exchanged
between the offender, who was described as
‘obviously upset and emotional,’ and Ms Latimer’s grandmother,
Mrs Latimer[10]
who had previously called in.[9] The offender left the property
to return with a jerry can of petrol, entering the property through
garage.[10] Mrs Latimer, who had returned, called to the offender ‘no Dane
don’t do this’ before calling triple
0.[11] The offender exited the
property and drove away at speed after lighting the fire.[11] The fire was
brought under control by
emergency services, having completely destroyed the
unit and caused smoke, heat and water damage to the adjoining
The offender was arrested the following day, claiming the fire
was an accident.[13]
The offender’s personal

between himself and his mother or stepfather.[14]
The offender denied any
history of violence, substance abuse or sexual abuse within the family however

the use and supply of drugs.[14]
The offender
consumed cannabis and alcohol from the age of nine or 10 and following the
breakdown of his parent’s relationship
at age 12 he stated to engage in
antisocial behaviour.[15] The alcohol and cannabis usage continued until age 13
to 15. At the age
of 24 the offender started to use heroin.[16] The offender
was also using methylamphetamine on a daily basis as well as taking

Sentencing considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal
background of the offender and/ or indicators of disadvantage
The District Court at first instance considered the
offender’s circumstances when considering the total term and non-parole
period. These factors included the offender’s ‘dysfunctional’
background.[26] On appeal, Hulme J affirmed the
reference by Syme DCJ to the
offender’s circumstances: ‘he has a dysfunctional background which
has informed and led
to his criminal behaviour since he was a young
Counsel for the offender submitted that these factors
were only taken into account when considering special circumstances however
Hulme J held that these were taken into account for the total term as well as
non-parole period.[30]
Upon resentencing Hulme J considered the
offender’s ‘substantial’ criminal history including the
committal of this
offence while on parole.[41] It was however held that these
factors need to be considered in the context of his upbringing which
substance abuse from a young age as well as a dysfunctional family situation
during his teenage years.[41]
On appeal Hulme J upheld the findings of
special circumstances of the sentencing judge.[44]
Relevant passages
A significant feature of this case is that the
offence occurred less than four months after the applicant had been released on
for earlier serious offences. He has a substantial criminal history and
is institutionalised. Such a history has to be viewed in
the context of the
circumstances of his upbringing, including his introduction to alcohol and drugs
at a very young age and the dysfunction
that attended his family life from the
beginning of his teenage years.[41]
Grounds of appeal
Honour erred in taking the applicant's deprived and dysfunctional background,
improvements in his behaviour whilst in custody
and youth into account only when
considering special circumstances;[29]-[31]
was not open for her Honour to find that the applicant had been subject to
lengthy supervision in the community;[32]-[35] and
sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.[36]-[39]
Appeal outcome/s
NB: The findings of
special circumstances by the Syme DCJ were maintained.[44]
upheld:[31] suitable reference was made early in the judgement at first
instance. Given that the judgement was delivered ex tempore,
leniency was given
to the judgement’s structure;[30]
upheld [34]: at first instance, Her Honour had intended to convey that the
offender had been subject to parole periods previously
which he had not taken
advantage of.[34] Special circumstances had in fact been found and the parole
period lengthened to reflect
this;[35] and
[39]: a sentence of eight years against a maximum of 10 years before considering
a reduction based on a guilty pleas placed
the offence in or close to the worst
category.[38] Her Honour failed to make a finding on the level of objective
seriousness[37]
which is necessary for seriousness deemed in or close to the
worst category.[38] Hulme J held that the objective seriousness was
mid-range but not near the top.[39]
Hence Hulme J gave an allowance of 25
per cent for the utilitarian value of the guilty plea, with a term of
imprisonment of five years.[44]
Having regard to the circumstances of the case,
a non parole-period of three years and three months was
ordered.[44]
