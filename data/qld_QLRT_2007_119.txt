On 4 April 2007 the Tribunal
sent letters to the miners and the landholders bringing the referral of this
matter to the Tribunal by
the Mining Registrar to their attention, and advising
them of their obligations under Practice Direction 1 of 2003. Timeframes for
the submission of relevant material were provided to each party. The miners
have submitted that compensation should remain as originally
determined by the
Mining Warden on 26 June 1996, that being the sum of $170 per

with the Tribunal Practice Direction as far as providing
evidence and

It is not an uncommon
occurrence for either or both parties in a compensation matter before the

acknowledge his 1996 determination of compensation (as Mining Warden) for this
Determination
The Mining Registrar has
provided a copy of the Department of Natural Resources and Water QVAS Property
Details Report for the landholders’
property which shows the unimproved
valuation, valuation date 1 October 2004, in the sum of $650,000.00 for the
125,640 hectare property.
Using the unimproved valuation, and assuming the land
subject to the mining lease is of an average standard for the property, the
unimproved value of the mining lease land equates to $5.17 per hectare.
Although the purpose of the unimproved valuation is not
for determining
compensation under the
Mineral Resources Act
(the Act), given the
absence of any other evidence, I am prepared to accept the value of the land as
at 1 October 2004 to be,
up, $5.20 per hectare. Further, absent any
evidence that I can rely on as to any change in value subsequent to that date,
$5.20 per hectare for the purposes of this determination. I note that
this sum closely equates to the value applied by the
Warden, and I am
prepared to follow his previous determination in determining compensation on a
per hectare per year basis.
Taking into account all
heads of compensation in
subsection 3
of the Act, I assess compensation
in the sum of $5.20 per hectare
per year, which for 34.4 hectares equates to
$178.88, which I round
up to $180.00. Pursuant to
s 281(4)(e)
of the Act, I

26.06.96. In assessing compensation, no submissions were made by either party
to the Mining Warden. Doing the best
he could with the lack of evidence, he
assessed compensation in the sum of $5.00 per ha per year for 34 ha.
