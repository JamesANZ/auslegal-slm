Reasons for Decision
Background to review
Applicant made a request to the Agency seeking access to the following
I request an opportunity to view all related CCTV footage
at [venue] between the hours of [hours] on [date]. This footage must include
area and surrounding areas showing [part of venue] and anyone in the area at
this time. I also ask to see footage of my going
up to enquire with [venue]
staff at the front desk between [hours] and five minutes either side of this...
Applicant specified in their request that they do not seek access to personal
affairs information and that it can be removed.
Agency identified two documents falling within the terms of the
Applicant’s request and refused access in full under sections
31(1)(d). The Agency’s decision letter sets out the reasons for its

49H(2) in relation to the review.
have considered relevant communications and submissions received from the
undertaking my review, I have had regard to the object of the FOI Act, which is
to create a general right of access to information
in the possession of the
Government or other public bodies, limited only by exceptions and exemptions
necessary to protect essential
public interests, privacy and business
note Parliament’s intention the FOI Act must be interpreted so as to
further the object of the Act and any discretions conferred
by the Act must be
exercised, as far as possible, so as to facilitate and promote the disclosure of
information in a timely manner
and at the lowest reasonable cost.
Initial view
the review, OVIC provided the Applicant with an initial view that the
Agency’s decision would be upheld and explained
why. The Applicant was
invited to consider withdrawing their review application or to otherwise provide
a submission in support of
their review application. The Applicant was also
provided with advice about alternate steps they could take if they were seeking
information about a specific incident.
Applicant asked for their review to continue to a formal decision. The Applicant
did not provide any further information of assistance
in relation to their
review application.
Review of exemptions
Section 33(1) – Documents affecting personal privacy of third
33(1) protects an individual’s privacy where their right to privacy
outweighs the public interest in disclosing their
information.
This will only occur
when disclosing the individual’s personal affairs information is
unreasonable.
document or information is exempt under section 33(1) if two conditions are
(a) the document or information relates to the ‘personal affairs’ of
a natural person (living or deceased)
(b) disclosure of that personal affairs information is unreasonable in all the
circumstances.
more information about section 33(1), see the FOI
Guidelines.
note the Applicant’s request terms appear to seek access to footage
depicting themselves and any other people in certain areas
of the [venue] at
specific timeframes. However, the Applicant’s request also specifically
advised that they do not seek access
to personal affairs information. This means
that if the documents contain information that identifies other people, it is
to scope of the Applicant’s request.
such, I will consider whether the documents contain personal affairs information
of other people (
third parties
Do the documents contain
personal affairs information of other individuals?
33(9) defines personal affairs information to include:
(a) information that identifies any person
(b) information that discloses a person’s address or location
(c) any information from which a person’s identity, address or location
can reasonably be determined.
document will involve the disclosure of personal affairs information if the
applicant or any member of the public could directly
or indirectly identify an
individual or their address or location from the
information.
concept of personal affairs information is broad. Information will relate to the
personal affairs of a person if it ‘concerns
or affects that person as an
individual’.
This includes
information relating to health, private behaviour, home life, or personal or
family relationships of
individuals.
documents located contain 3 hours of CCTV footage which feature several
individuals entering and exiting the [venue], using [the
venue’s services]
and undertaking other everyday activities. This includes both [venue] staff and
members of the public using
the [venue].
documents capture the faces of several individuals which if released, would be
reasonably capable of identifying them. Further,
those captured in the footage
may also be identifiable by what they were wearing or if others had knowledge of
their whereabouts
on that particular day.
the terms of the Applicant’s request, I have attempted to pinpoint what
information in the documents may be of relevance.
However, based on the limited
information before me, I am unable to confirm for certain that the Applicant is
amongst those captured
in the footage.

documents contain personal affairs information
of persons other than the
Applicant (
third parties
Accordingly,
as the Applicant does not seek access to personal affairs information of third
parties, it is unnecessary to consider
whether disclosing the personal affairs
information would be unreasonable in the circumstances. Instead, I will later
consider if
it is practicable to edit the documents to delete the personal
affairs information of third parties.
Section 31(1)(d)
– Disclosure of methods for preventing, detecting, investigating breaches
document or information is exempt under section 31(1)(d) if two conditions are
(a) disclosure of the information would, or would be reasonably likely to
disclose methods or
procedures for preventing, detecting, investigating,
or dealing with breaches of the law
(b) release of the information would, or would be reasonably likely to
prejudice the effectiveness
of those methods or procedures.
Agency provided the following reasons in their decision letter in relation to
their reliance on this section:
If Council were to release the
footage, it would show vantage points and positions of the CCTV cameras located
in the [venue]. These
cameras have been installed for the purpose of
surveillance and detecting wrongdoing. In
Parker v Court Services
[2021] VCAT 461
, the VCAT found that viewing CCTV footage would
disclose aspects of the operation of the cameras including the limits of their
and any blind spots.
In this instance, if the location or position of the cameras in the [venue]
became known, it would be reasonably likely to prejudice
the effectiveness of
the cameras, as members of the public could evade detection of any wrongdoing by
committing any wrongdoing out
Parker v Court Services
I accept that the use
of CCTV in public [venues] is well known. They are generally visible, and the
public knows what they are used
for. However, as stated in
Parker v Court
Services Victoria
, I agree in this case that:
Viewing footage
from particular cameras would, however, disclose aspects of the operation of the
camera that would not otherwise be
known, including:
(a) The limits of the range of vision or the coverage of the cameras, including
any blind spots; and
(b) The timing of recordings.
I accept that this would be reasonably likely to undermine the effectiveness
of the CCTV cameras, including as a deterrent measure,
by potentially indicating
how the cameras could be circumvented.
accept the CCTV footage is used when detecting, investigating or dealing with
matters arising out of breaches or evasions of the
Accordingly,
I am satisfied that release of the documents would disclose methods or
procedures that is released, would be reasonably
likely to prejudice the
effectiveness of the cameras.
I am satisfied the documents are exempt from release under section
Section 25 – Deletion of exempt or irrelevant
information
25 requires an agency to grant access to an edited copy of a document where it
is practicable to delete exempt or irrelevant
information, and the applicant
agrees to receiving such a copy.
whether it is ‘practicable’ to delete exempt or irrelevant
information requires an agency or Minister to consider:
(a) the effort involved in making the deletions from a resources point of
(b) the effectiveness of those deletions – that is, whether the edited
document still has meaning.
have considered the effect of deleting exempt and irrelevant personal affairs
information from the documents. In my view, it is
not practicable for the Agency
to do this for several reasons, including that the intertwined nature of the
personal affairs information
would make editing out content depicting third
parties time consuming and effectively make the footage devoid of any relevant
and moreover that I find section 31(1)(d) applies to the totality of the
footage in this case.
the information before me, I am satisfied the documents are exempt from release
section 31(1)(d) and contain irrelevant personal
affairs information of third
I am satisfied it is not practicable to provide the Applicant with an edited
copy of the documents with exempt and irrelevant information
