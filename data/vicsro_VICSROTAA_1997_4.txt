Objections Lodged Out of Time (TAA-004V1) [1997] VICSROTAA 4 (1 July 1997)
Revenue Rulings
Please continue over page
Taxation Administration Act 1997
into effect on 1 July 1997 and consolidates the
administrative provisions of the
Payroll Tax Act 1971
Financial Institutions Duty Act 1982
Tax Act 1990
. These Acts are defined as ‘taxation
laws’ under the TAA. The purpose of the TAA is to
provide a consistent approach to the administration
of these taxes and duties in Victoria.
Section 99 of the TAA requires that objections must
be lodged within 60 days of the service of the notice
of assessment or notice of decision. In general, this
provision must be complied with for an objection
to be valid. However, section 100 provides that
the Commissioner of State Revenue has a discretion
to consider an objection lodged outside the
60 day period.
The purpose of this Ruling is to advise taxpayers
and their advisers of factors which the Commissioner
of State Revenue will take into account when
determining whether to exercise the discretion to
consider objections which are lodged outside the
60 day period. All requests received will be considered
on their merits, but due regard will be given to the
general guidelines set out below.
Any decision made by the Commissioner of State
Revenue, including refusal of the application, is
‘non-reviewable’. This means that it is not possible
for a taxpayer to seek judicial or administrative
review of the Commissioner of State Revenue’s
decision in relation to the application.
Objections lodged outside the 60 days time limit
should be considered as invalid objections
The Commissioner of State Revenue will consider
that all objections lodged later than the 60 day time
limit are invalid unless there are sufficient reasons
for the Commissioner of State Revenue to exercise
this discretion to accept a late objection.
This approach is consistent with section 99 of the
TAA which imposes a 60 day time limit from the
service of the notice of assessment or notice of
decision, on lodging objections. It should not be
assumed by any taxpayer or their agent that the
Commissioner of State Revenue will exercise the
discretion in their favour.
Applications for Extension of Time
An application for the Commissioner of State
Revenue to exercise the discretion to consider an
objection lodged out of time must be in writing.
The application must state fully and in detail the
circumstances concerning, and the reasons for, the
failure by the taxpayer (or their agent) to comply
with the statutory time limit for lodging objections.
The Commissioner of State Revenue, in considering
the application, may refuse to exercise the
discretion, exercise the discretion, or exercise the
discretion subject to conditions.
Taxpayers or their agents should not seek to rely on
verbal undertakings or advice concerning the likely
success of an application given by SRO staff in the
course of any telephone discussion or meetings. The
TAA provision requires due consideration of a written
application before a decision can be made.

ON THE MOVE
Evidence in Support of Application
The Commissioner of State Revenue may request
that an applicant provide evidence or information
in support of any claims made in the application.
This information may include copies of medical
certificates or a statutory declaration.
Notice of Decision
The Commissioner of State Revenue’s decision in
relation to the application to lodge an objection
outside the 60 day period will be conveyed to the
taxpayer in writing.
Consideration of Applications
Extent of the Delay in Lodging the Objection
The extent of the time delay between the last date
for lodgement of an objection and the date on
which the taxpayer sought permission to lodge a
late objection will be a factor considered.
The Commissioner of State Revenue will consider
the time the taxpayer took to respond to the initial
decision, determination or assessment to which the
objection relates.
In considering whether the delay was reasonable,
the Commissioner of State Revenue will also have
regard to whether the grounds of objection are
complex. If the issue is novel or obscure, the
Commissioner of State Revenue is more likely to
consider the application favourably.
That a taxpayer cites ignorance of the law relating
to objections would not of itself be considered
sufficient. Relevant information is well publicised
through information bulletins, Revenue Rulings,
seminars and the objections form. It is always open
to a taxpayer who is uncertain about the process to
The SRO has had a practice of accepting that
objections lodged by post have been received within
the 60 day period, if received by the SRO no later
than two (2) days after the expiration of the 60 day
period. This practice will continue.
Delays caused by circumstances outside the
taxpayer’s control
The Commissioner of State Revenue will look
favourably on the application where the delay was
caused by circumstances outside the taxpayer’s
control. This will include situations such as:
• changes to applicable taxation laws which
directly result from court decisions;
• postal or delivery delays due to strikes or natural
disasters (but not where the taxpayer could have
arranged other means of delivery because of
knowledge of the likelihood of a delay);
• fires, floods or other natural disasters;
• unavailability of key personnel because of
sudden resignation, ill-health or death; and
• computer system breakdowns, including third
party systems.
Each decision made by the State Revenue Office is
made on the merits of each individual case having
regard to any relevant ruling. All rulings must be
read subject to Revenue Ruling GEN.01.
