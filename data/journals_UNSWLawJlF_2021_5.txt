DEFAMATION ACTIONS AND AUSTRALIAN POLITICS
MICHAEL DOUGLAS
I INTRODUCTION
In recent years, politicians have been frequent participants in Australian
defamation litigation.
Attorney-General Christian Porter’s recent claim against the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation (‘ABC’) and journalist
is a notable example of
the weaponisation of defamation in Australian politics.
This brief article reviews prominent examples of where politicians have
commenced or threatened defamation proceedings. The focus
is on cases in which
politicians are plaintiffs, although some cases mentioned below also involve
politician defendants.
The article
considers whether the trend of politicians litigating defamation is desirable,
and how it will be affected by the amendment
of the Uniform Defamation
once the Model Defamation
Amendment Provisions 2020
implemented. It begins by considering the value of politicians’
reputations, which defamation law may protect.
II POLITICIANS’ REPUTATIONS
‘Reputation’ is a multi-faceted concept at the heart of
defamation law.
The value of a
person’s reputation is bound up with their honour and
and their standing in
Australian defamation law
protects the value of a person’s interest in their reputation by providing
that publication of matter
actionable.
If reputation is what
society generally thinks of a
then every one of us who
is part of the community has a reputation. Politicians are no different.
Politicians’ reputations may be different to those of ‘regular
people’ in some respects. First, a politician derives
an income from their
reputation in a way that many (but not all) individuals do not. While impact on
a person’s employment
may sound in special damages that would be
unavailable to a person whose employment was not affected by
defamation,
the High Court has
confirmed that the general test for defamation applies to professional and
non-professional reputations
Second, politicians’ reputations are bound up with their work in
political institutions. We judge politicians by their ability
to deliver on
promises, their integrity, and how their expressed values align with their lived
Our system of
representative government depends on politicians’ accountability to the
public. Thus, some criticism of public
officials is to be expected or even
welcomed. Arguably, the public is less likely to take a derogatory comment about
a politician
to heart; people understand that politicians will be criticised no
matter what.
However, insofar that Australian law protects freedom of speech in order to
keep leaders accountable, its focus is on the subject
matter rather than the
The freedom of political
communication implied in the
Commonwealth
Constitution
is narrowly
confined to certain political speech. The so-called ‘
qualified privilege’
underpinned by that freedom is narrow in its
as some of the cases
below illustrate.
Third, putting aside their financial incentives, politicians may have a
stronger incentive to sue over defamation than other would-be
plaintiffs.
Perception is critical to a politician maintaining their standing in the system
and grip on power. Several Australian
politicians have resigned in the wake of
allegations of impropriety.
Although truth provides the foundation of a justification defence for a person
publishing an allegation of
impropriety,
the mere threat of
defamation litigation may be enough to sway some to believe that any allegations
were unfounded. The mention of
defamation by a politician can signal to the
electorate that damaging publications are merely ‘fake news’. The
of defamation litigation involving politicians shows that many
perceive defamation law as providing a powerful political

highlights a strength of Australian defamation law:
it provides an important check on media organisations which, if unconstrained,
may abandon any pretence of neutrality and wield their influence to achieve
political goals.
Defamation law
is at its most potent when a publisher strays from the truth for political ends.
A recent example of that:
Leyonhjelm v
Hanson-Young
Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young is at the opposite end of the political
spectrum to the Liberal Democrat and former Senator, David
Leyonhjelm. On 13
June 2018, during the hearing of a Senate motion, the then-senators directed
interjections at one another, neither
of which were recorded in Hansard. It was
agreed that Leyonhjelm said ‘you should stop shagging men,
apparently because
he believed Hanson-Young had said ‘all men are rapists’ or something
to that effect.
The nastiness
escalated, at least on the part of Leyonhjelm, who then made further comments
and in media interviews. Hanson-Young
commenced defamation proceedings in the Federal Court relying on the
publications made outside
of Parliament.
The matter came to trial after some interlocutory
by which point
Leyonhjelm ran some interesting
Notably, he averred
the imputations particularised by Hanson-Young as being carried by the matter
while arguing that they were not
defamatory.
That argument relied
on the view that ‘robust’ exchange of criticism between political
opponents is just part of politics.
The trial judge, White J,

case involving Tom Uren:
Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v

Menzies J said,

defence fails unless the conduct of the defendant in publishing the matter was
reasonable in the circumstances.
The former Senator had not acted reasonably because he could not state with any
accuracy the words spoken by Hanson-Young on which
he relied in subsequently
criticising her.
The Court thus

So if Leyonhjelm were to otherwise have had a qualified privilege defence at

, he would have failed.
On appeal, the issues included whether the trial judge was correct to reject
the statutory qualified privilege defence and to hold
that Leyonhjelm was
actuated by malice.
These issues
divided the Court. In dissent, Rares J sided with Leyonhjelm. In separate sets
of reasons, Abraham J and Wigney J disagreed.
Their findings on reasonableness
were expressed in stark terms. Wigney J’s dicta are worth repeating at
Simply put, Mr Leyonhjelm launched a full-scale personal attack on Senator
Hanson-Young’s character and integrity on the most
flimsy of pretences:
that she was supposed to have said something the effect of which was
self-evidently absurd, but in circumstances
where he plainly was not, and could
not have been, certain or even confident about exactly what she had said. That
attack was manifestly
crass, offensive and obviously sexist. It employed
boys’-own locker-room gossip and innuendo – of the most dubious
– to shame, ridicule and embarrass Senator Hanson-Young before
the public at large. That attack went well beyond what was reasonably
to defend or justify the statement that he had made in Parliament. It was one
thing for Mr Leyonhjelm to claim that his
interjection during the debate was
intended to expose what he considered to be the absurdity and hypocrisy of
Senator Hanson-Young’s
interjection; it was another thing altogether to
exploit the occasion by making what amounted to little more than a crude and
attack on Senator Hanson-Young’s private life.
Perhaps more significantly, as the primary judge found, the offensive
personal attack was also made in circumstances where any reasonable
including a politician, would, before launching such a belittling personal
attack, take at least some steps to check, with
Senator Hanson-Young or anyone
else, that Senator Hanson-Young had in fact made the absurd claim that he
supposedly believed she
had made in Parliament. To use the language of the
legislation, Mr Leyonhjelm made no attempt to get Senator Hanson-Young’s
‘side of the story’, let alone provide her response, and effectively
took no steps to verify the critical fact that supposedly
provided the basis for
his attack ... It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that he did nothing in
that regard because he was determined,
in any event, to use the occasion to vent
his ill-will and personally belittle and embarrass someone towards whom he was
His Honour continued, ‘[t]he fact that Mr Leyonhjelm was a politician
and that the target of his personal attack was his political
opponent does not
somehow convert or transform what was manifestly unreasonable conduct into
reasonable conduct’.
came the crescendo:
even in the context of political discourse, if that is how Mr
Leyonhjelm’s self-justifying blatherings in the media could accurately
characterised, there must be a line beyond which needlessly and gratuitously
offensive and boorish statements about the personal
life of one’s
political opponents can be considered to be unreasonable. That line was clearly
crossed in this case.
Leyonhjelm’s case illustrates that we unfortunately live in an era of
political incivility. Long gone are the days where a minister
would stand aside

of such a strategy.

Porter to criticism for hypocrisy. Part of the irony of
Porter’s case is
that in his capacity to Attorney-General, he has advocated for law reform to
combat exactly this sort of Federal

While Porter’s defamation claim will embolden some critics and repel
some undecideds, in the context of the political environment
he was facing, it
was perhaps the only path forward in order to salvage his political career. The
case is a paradigm example of how

matter concerning an issue of public interest’ in a proposed section 29A
provides that:
(1) It is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter if the defendant
proves that:
(a) the matter concerns an issue of public interest, and
(b) the defendant reasonably believed that the publication of the matter was
in the public interest.
The deference to the ‘reasonable belief’ of the publisher, and
thus editorial judgment, will be of great assistance to
respondents in cases
like Porter’s claim against the ABC and Milligan. Section 29A(3) sets out
a list of non-exhaustive factors
which the court may take into account in
considering the defence, including ‘the extent to which the matter
published distinguishes
between suspicions, allegations and proven facts’
(at (b)), and ‘the importance of freedom of expression in the discussion
of issues of public interest’ (at (a)). It is hard to conceive of

commentary. In a mass society, political commentary
is essential: it informs
electors and thus enhances our representative democracy. Arguably, electors have
a right to be informed
on matters relevant to their participation in democracy;
defamation actions may inhibit that right.
However, in my view, the tension between defamation and Australian politics
ought not be resolved by further changes to the Uniform
Defamation Acts. To
remove the possibility of a defamation action by an Australian politician would
be a step too far; they have

statutory defence of ‘publication of matter concerning
an issue of public
interest’ will likely remedy the situation, making life far more difficult
for future politician plaintiffs.
Moreover, the implied freedom of political
communication may yet impact the application of the common law of defamation in
brought by politicians, separately from
qualified privilege.
In their defence to Porter’s claim, the Respondents pleaded that the
implied freedom should affect findings
on both identification and damages, apart

Ideally, our leaders would just be reasonable. Politicians should exercise
self-restraint and manifest the civility for which, by
litigating, they
seemingly call. They should refrain from suing over matters that constitute
genuine political discourse. If politicians
go too far in what they see as
holding their critics to account, then electors should hold them accountable at
the ballot box.

Shields v Williams
The Federal Court could still order a
trial by jury. In
, Allsop CJ and Besanko J of the Full Court opined,
‘we can envisage cases where there might be good reason to have a jury.
For example ... there might be a case where there is a real issue as to whether
changing community standards mean that the words
considered defamatory of a
person, say 30 years ago, would no longer be considered defamatory. There may be
other circumstances and
it is neither possible nor desirable for us to state in
advance the cases that might call for an order for a jury’:

Explanatory Note, Model Defamation
Amendment Provisions 2020
<https://www.pcc.gov.au/uniform/2020/Model_Defamation_Amendment_Provisions_2020.pdf>.
Some aspects of those amendments, like
the introduction of a statutory serious harm threshold, were modelled on
provisions in the
Defamation Act 2013
(UK). Those UK provisions have had
a mixed reception and were disappointing to some: see Alastair Mullis and Andrew
Scott, ‘Tilting
at Windmills: The
Defamation Act 2013

Good? An Empirical Observation and Analysis of the Effects of the Serious Harm
Requirement

Defamation Act 2013

<https://inforrm.org/2014/04/25/reflections-on-the-defamation-act-2013-one-year-after-royal-assent-matthew-collins/>.
Historical proposals for what became
this new defence were modelled on UK law; the amendment that is forthcoming is
distinguishable.
