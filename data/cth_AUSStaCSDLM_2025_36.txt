Expenditure and Taxation in Delegated Legislation [2025] AUSStaCSDLM 36 (31 July 2025)
Chapter 5 :
Expenditure and taxation in delegated legislation1
Levying of taxation in delegated legislation
Expenditure and taxation in delegated
legislation
5.1 This Chapter identifies the instruments which the committee has resolved
to draw to the attention of the Senate under standing
order 23(4) in the
interest of promoting appropriate parliamentary scrutiny of Commonwealth
expenditure in delegated legislation.
This includes expenditure-related instruments and instruments that levy
of taxation in delegated legislation
5.2 The committee considers that one of the most
fundamental functions of the Parliament is to levy taxation. The committee's
longstanding
view is that it is for the Parliament, rather than makers of
delegated legislation, to set a rate of tax (in accordance with Senate
order 23(3)(j)). Where a tax is imposed in delegated legislation, the
committee's concerns are heightened if it is not limited
by a cap in the
relevant enabling Act.
5.3 As the levying of taxation in delegated legislation is a systemic
technical scrutiny matter, the committee has resolved to draw
the following
instruments to the attention of the Senate under standing order 23(4).
Limit on the taxation amount in primary
legislation?

Premium and Special Tuition Protection Components) Determination
