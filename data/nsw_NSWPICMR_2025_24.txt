STATEMENT OF REASONS
INTRODUCTION
Proctor was involved in a motor accident on 15 November 2024. He made a claim
for statutory benefits under the
Motor Accident Injuries Act 2017
MAI Act) against QBE, the third-party insurer of the vehicle. QBE accepted the
claim and its liability to pay Mr Proctor the
benefits to which he is
Proctor lives in rural NSW near Albury. He was, at the time of the accident
close to 76 years of age and a farmer.
9 April 2025 the insurer determined the claimant was an earner but that his
pre-accident average weekly earnings (PAWE) was nil.
21 May 2025, the insurer’s internal reviewer determined the
claimant’s PAWE was $596.46 which the claimant disputed.
19 June 2025 the claimant, through his solicitors, lodged an application for
Merit Review with the Personal Injury Commission (the
Commission). On 20 August
2025, Merit Reviewer Ruschen determined that the claimant’s PAWE was
$651.71 per week
Reviewer Ruschen referred the matter back to the Commission for a determination
as to the parties’ entitlement to costs
and that matter was allocated to
me for assessment. I held a teleconference with the legal representatives on 27
August 2025.
LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK
MAI Act establishes in Part 3 a scheme for benefits and compensation to be paid
to persons injured in motor accidents in New South
Wales. Statutory benefits
include weekly income replacement type benefits in accordance with Division 3.3
as well as treatment and
care benefits pursuant to Division 3.4.
8 of the MAI Act concerns costs and fees payable. The provisions relevant to the
matters the subject of the current proceedings
are as follows:
(a) there is power to make regulations fixing the maximum amount of legal
services or related expenses that can be paid and the power
to declare matters
for which no costs are payable (s 8.3(1));
(b) legal practitioners are not entitled to be paid or recover costs beyond the
regulated amounts and are not entitled to payment
or recovery if it is declared
that no costs are payable (s 8.3(3)) but are entitled to be paid or recover
legal costs if the regulations
or the Commission permits it (s 8.3(4);
(c) in a statutory benefits claim, the claimant is entitled to recover
reasonable and necessary legal costs (and other costs) from
the insurer (s
(d) the regulations can specify a maximum amount of costs or specify that no
costs are payable (s 8.10(2));
(e) claimants can only recover legal costs if payment is permitted by the
regulation or the Commission (s 8.10(3)), and
(f) the Commission can permit payment of costs if the claimant is a person under
legal incapacity or if exceptional circumstances
exist (s 8.10(4)).
Dispute resolution
1 of the Motor Accident Injuries Regulation 2017 (the Regulation) declares that
certain disputes are regulated merit review,
medical assessment or miscellaneous
claims assessment matters for which costs are payable. Disputes about PAWE are
not included in
the list of regulated merit review matters which means, by
operation of s 8.3(4) and s 8.10(3), that no costs are payable or recoverable
either parties’ legal representatives unless the Commission permits
terms of the
entitlement
to costs outside the Regulation, it is the
Commission that has power to make that decision for these reasons:
(a) pursuant to s 24 of the
Personal Injury Commission Act 2020 (
the Commission has the jurisdiction and functions given to it under
the MAI Act;
(b) section 31(1) says that the Commission is constituted by one or more
(c) merit reviewers are not members, but they are decision-makers appointed
under s 33 of the PIC Act and in accordance with that
section have functions
conferred under the PIC Act or the MAI Act, and
(d) section 8.3(4) and 8.10(4) of the MAI Act confer a function on the
Commission (which is constituted by a member), but not on
merit reviewers or any
other other decision-makers.
terms of the
of the claimant’s costs beyond the regulated
amounts, schedule 2(1)(aa) of the MAI Act declares that to be a merit review
There is however no power in the MAI Act for a Member or a
decision-maker to assess the quantum of the insurer’s legal
representative’s
CONSIDERATION OF THE ISSUES
What is claimed and what is in dispute?
insurer in its submissions accepts that the claimant should be permitted costs
beyond the scheme in the Regulation under s 8.10
of the MAI Act.
insurer’s legal representative seeks costs beyond the scheme in the
Regulation under s 8.3 of the MAI Act.
the teleconference held with the parties, Ms Campbell advised that the claimant
seeks costs in the following sums:
(a) professional legal costs which are claimed in the sum which would have been
available had the dispute been a regulated merit
review or miscellaneous claims
assessment matter (16 monetary units currently $1,992 plus GST)), and
(b) the cost of obtaining taxation returns and business information from the
claimant’s accountant in the sum of $649.00 including
Malley advised that the insurer agreed that those sums were, if permitted,
reasonable and necessary.
I hold both an appointment as a Member of the Commission and as a Merit
Reviewer, I advised the parties I would determine both
the parties’
entitlement to costs beyond the Regulation and in terms of the claimant’s
costs, the quantum of those costs.
Are the parties entitled to
costs beyond the Regulation?
am satisfied that the claimant is entitled to costs beyond the Regulation
because there are exceptional circumstances in the claim
which justify the costs
incurred for the following reasons:
(a) the claimant’s application was successful and the claimant’s
PAWE was increased and therefore his statutory benefits
were increased;
(b) the claimant was a farmer with both his own business and a business he
operated in partnership with someone else;
(c) his partner had died in the year before the accident;
(d) there was uncertainty as to which subclause of clause 4 of Schedule 1 of the
MAI Act applied, and
(e) the calculation of earnings was complicated by the dual sources of income
and required input from a forensic accountant (for
the insurer) and documents
from the claimant’s accountants.
am also satisfied that the insurer is entitled to costs beyond the Regulation
because of the complications and complexities in the
claimant’s employment
and business arrangements as noted above and the insurer’s need to obtain
a forensic accountant’s
What is the quantum of the
claimant’s costs?
claimant is only permitted to recover the reasonable and necessary legal costs
in a matter.
activities and stages of the dispute were as follows:
(a) there was an initial application comprising 26 pages of documents lodged on
or about 19 June 2025 and short submissions were
(b) the application was accepted, and a timetable was issued by the Commission
on 23 June 2025;
(c) the insurer filed a notice of representation on 30 June 2025, a reply form
and on 8 July 2025 a bundle of more than 200 pages
of documents comprising
submissions, a forensic accountant’s report and financial records;
(d) on 15 July 2025 the Merit Reviewer issued directions to the parties for
submissions and advised the parties the matter would
be decided on the papers
unless someone requested a teleconference;
(e) on 30 July 2025 further submissions were lodged by the claimant;
(f) on 14 August 2025 the insurer uploaded very brief submissions, and
(g) on 20 August 2025 the Merit Review issued her decision comprising 11 pages.
was reasonable and necessary for the above steps to be taken which required the
claimant’s solicitor to take action for example
by lodging the
application, reading the insurer’s reply and submissions, liaising with
the Commission and reviewing the Merit
Reviewer’s decision.
the light of the insurer’s agreement and on my own consideration of the
work done in this matter, I am satisfied that the
sum of $1,992 is a fair sum
for all of the above activities to which GST of $199.20 must be added. I am also
of the view the fee
for the claimant’s accountant’s services in the
sum of $649 is reasonable and necessary in the light of the complexity
claimant’s business arrangements.
total of the sum of costs recoverable by the claimant from the insurer is
$2,840.20 inclusive of GST.
At the time these reasons were
issued Merit Reviewer Ruschen’s decision had not been published.
