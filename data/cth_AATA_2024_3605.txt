Member Lee Benjamin

compensation pursuant to the
Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees)
) in relation to his contraction of
mesothelioma. The late Mr Gough sought to attribute his mesothelioma to
employment by Trans Australia
27 February 1981, in the context of his mesothelioma, it was determined that the
late Mr Gough had not suffered the contraction
of a disease, or the aggravation,
acceleration or recurrence of a disease, to which his TAA employment was a
contributing factor
with the result that his claim was disallowed under the 1971
Act. That determination was affirmed upon reconsideration.
late Mr Gough then applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review the
disallowance of his claim. After a hearing on
the merits, the Tribunal affirmed
the disallowance of the late Mr Gough’s claim:
Re John Edward Gough and
Trans Australia Airlines

There is no evidence of the late
Mr Gough applying for, or overturning that decision on, judicial review.
1 June 2017, Mr Stephen Gough, as the personal legal representative of the late
Mr Gough submitted a claim for compensation in
relation to the death of the late
Mr Gough from mesothelioma. Mr Stephen Gough sought to attribute the late Mr
Gough’s mesothelioma

mesothelioma. It was also determined that the

(c) $17,068.82 was payable to Mr Stephen Gough and $6,234.59 was payable to Mr

16 October 2017, Mr Stephen Gough wrote to Comcare and requested reconsideration
in relation to Comcare’s determination issued on September 21
15 December 2017, Comcare wrote to Mr Stephen Gough and advised that it had
completed its review. Comcare concluded that the original
determination could no
longer be sustained and decided to revoke it. In effect, Comcare decided to
disallow Mr Gough’s claim.
23 February 2018, Mr Stephen Gough lodged with the Tribunal an application for
review of the decision of 15 December 2017 (
AAT Application No.
22 March 2019, Mr Stephen Gough submitted that the Tribunal did not have
2017 given the effect of
section 129A of the SRC Act.
9 April 2019, the Tribunal held an interlocutory hearing where both parties were
given the opportunity to provide submissions in
relation to jurisdiction.
10 April 2019, the Tribunal found that it had the jurisdiction under
Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975
review the decision dated 21 December 2017.
4 December 2020, after a hearing on the merits, the Tribunal affirmed the
disallowance of Mr Gough’s claim:
Re Gough and Comcare
(Compensation)

There is no evidence of Mr Stephen Gough
applying for, or overturning that decision on, judicial review.

to the Tribunal for review of the decision dated
15 December 2017.
2 April 2024, the Tribunal held an interlocutory hearing to take submissions
from the parties.
WHAT QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ANSWERED?
Tribunal must consider whether:
(a) the Tribunal has jurisdiction to review Mr Gough’s application?; and
(b) it is reasonable in all the circumstances for an extension of time to be
WHAT ARE THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS?
my view (and I find that), the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to review Mr
Gough’s application because the Tribunal is '
functus officio
any case, even if the Tribunal had jurisdiction to review Mr Gough’s
application, I am of the view (and find that), it
is not reasonable in all the
circumstances to grant Mr Gough an extension of time to make his application.
WHY ARE THESE THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS?
the AAT Act, the Tribunal has jurisdiction and powers provided to it under
specific statutes, which enable the Tribunal to review
a reviewable
is not controversial that, generally, once the Tribunal has exercised its power
under section 43 of the AAT Act, the case law makes
it plain that the
Tribunal’s power to review the matter again is
Gough seeks the Tribunal “
relist 2018/0923 with the 15 December 2017
contends that the Tribunal is “
functus officio
” with regards
to AAT Application No. 2018/0923.
Gough says that Comcare purported to issue a second and impermissible reviewable
decision dated 15 December 2017, to revoke the
earlier 21 September 2017
reviewable decision to reinstate the revoked 1983 primary
determination.
Gough says that, in February 2018, he appealed to the Tribunal on the basis that
Comcare's second reviewable decision dated 15
December 2017 was incorrect in
law, and contrary to the weight of evidence and medical opinion concerning
asbestos exposure and mesothelioma
causation. He says that the “
application did not state the decision subject to the application was a death
claim decision
Gough claims that he was not properly “
” by the Tribunal
in the 2018/0923 matter. He says that Comcare engaged in conduct that the
may now determine amounted to contempt of the Tribunal under
s 63 of the AAT Act
.” He contends that Comcare “
and hindered the Tribunal from performing its functions
” in hearing
his application for “
review of Comcare's second reviewable decision on
the injury claim of the late John Gough by misleading the Tribunal that its 21
2017 decision was not a reviewable decision, but a primary
determination of a death claim
my respectful view, Mr Gough’s contentions are difficult to follow and
otherwise accept. Mr Gough was represented at the
hearing and acceded to the
Tribunal’s findings in the 2018/0923 matter because he did not appeal the
Tribunal decision to the
Federal Court of Australia.
drew my attention to the Tribunal’s decision in
Re Rana and Military
Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission
[2008] AATA 558, in which Deputy
President Forgie stated (see paragraph
The duty that is imposed upon the Tribunal must be to review the particular
decision of which review is sought and in relation to
which the Tribunal is
given jurisdiction. Once it has done so in accordance with its statutory
authority and power, it seems to me
that the Tribunal has done all that it can
lawfully do. It is functus officio.
further drew my attention to Deputy President Humphries’ comments at
paragraph [13] in
Kuchlmayr and Australian Capital Territory
(Compensation)
[2020] AATA
The power granted under statute to undertake a review of a particular
decision can, as a general rule, be exercised only once. It
is the power to
review a specific reviewable decision; once it has reviewed that decision and
decided to affirm it, overturn it or
remit it for fresh assessment to the
decision-maker, its statutory power to review is exhausted. At that point it is
functus officio
[Latin: having performed his office], meaning that it no longer
has any power to change or reconsider the decision it has made. That
is the same whether the decision is one made on the merits after a full hearing
or one produced as a result of the agreement
of the parties (Novosel v Comcare
[2017] FCA 722
. Even the courts have very limited powers to reopen
finalised decisions, preferring to direct affected parties to their right to
appeal to a higher court.
is apparent, Comcare contends, from the above background, the Tribunal has
previously decided to affirm the Respondent’s
decision dated 15 December
2017. To the extent that Mr Gough contends that the decision was made in
submits that the Tribunal has also previously
decided that the Tribunal has jurisdiction pursuant to section 25 of the AAT Act
review the decision.
Accordingly, Comcare contends that the Tribunal is functus officio and lacks the
my view, Comcare’s
submissions must be accepted.
if I am wrong about the Tribunal being functus officio, and the Tribunal
otherwise has jurisdiction to review Mr Gough’s
application, I am of the
view (and find) that it is not reasonable, in all the circumstances, to grant Mr
Gough an extension of time
to file his
application.
the basis of the materials before me:
(a) Mr Gough’s delay in filing the review and extension application (~5
years) is very significant;
(b) Mr Gough has not provided a reasonable explanation for the delay in lodging
his application;
(c) any substantive review in this application would appear to have poor
prospects of success; and
(d) refusal of the application for extension of time will not result in an
injustice to Mr Gough as he has another means of review
pursuant to another AAT
application currently on foot.
