Opal Mining Partnership Dispute
KARETSIAN v
[2016] SAWC
was an ex tempore judgment and I have edited it as to syntax and grammar. This
is a claim for partnership proceeds from an opal
mining partnership. I have
noted in another case today that these partnerships are loose contractual
arrangements and not a formal
partnership recognised under the
Partnership
. Tony Karetsian was in partnership with his brother John and
Jimmy. Tony was paying some expenses. He was entitled to 20% of proceeds
were trying to sell some opals from the partnership shortly before Christmas
Tony thought the parcel was worth $10,000 or more.
He went, in company with
Jimmy, to a Chinese buyer who offered $7,000. He refused to accept that. He
then offered to pay $2,000
to Jimmy and his brother, John, to meet their
expenses for Christmas to take the pressure off selling it.
was with Tony when that transaction occurred. He said that after that they went
to see Locksley, an opal valuer, and he said
‘You won’t get that
price if you want to sell it before Christmas.’ He had a look at it, he
classed it and said
it was worth - ‘If you get $4000 or more perhaps more
sell it, that’s all it’s worth.’
offered to sell it to Tony for $6,000 but Tony would not accept that.
went to see Helmut; he said it was worth 4,000. Jimmy then took Tony to buy some
alcohol at the Miners Store. Mrs Wong was there
and she came to the dugout to
look at the opal and things did not go particularly well there. Tony lost his
temper. Then they sold
the opal for a total of $5300, that is $4500 for the
opal parcel and another $800 for the chips and they gave him $1,100 which is
slightly more than the 20% to which he was entitled (5,300 x 0.2 = 1,060).
complains that he has been short-changed because the opal was worth more than
that. The opal, at that time, in the market was worth
absolutely top dollar
$7000 but he declined to accept that offer. Other people in town would not offer
more than $4500.
other partners offered to let him have the opal for a price under what he
thought it was worth and he declined that. He ended
the conversation by going
into a rage and smashed a chair and they went and got a price for it that was a
reasonable price and they
have accounted for that.
have done everything they were obliged to do. The claim is dismissed.
make it clear that there is nothing to stop John Karetsian from continuing to
mine his claim. I note that both John Karetsian and
Jimmy are willing to resume
a relationship with Tony if he wants. At the moment he does not want. I do not
think there is anything
else I need to say at this point.
