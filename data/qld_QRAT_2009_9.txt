Newham v Queensland Racing [2009] QRAT 9 (5 May 2009)
RACING APPEALS
NOTICE OF DECISION
Leigha Newham
RESPONDENT:
Queensland Racing
APPEARANCES:
Leigha Newham on her own behalf and Mr W Birch, steward for Queensland
Mr Leo Williams AO – Chairman
Mr Brockwell Miller – Deputy
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
On 23 February 2009 at the Gold Coast Turf Club some 65 track riders present
at the Club were instructed to present themselves for
the purpose of providing a
sample of urine. Ms Leigha Newham the appellant in this matter was
one of those riders. The sample that
she provided was found to have present in
it a prohibited substance at a time when she had been riding track work. She is
track work rider and she was charged under AR81 which reads:
Any rider commits an offence and may be penalised if –
(a) A sample taken from him is found upon analysis to contain the
presence of a substance banned by AR.81B.
It is not necessary to go into the history of the substance being found in
the track work rider’s system. Suffice to say this
appeal has been lodged
against the severity of penalty imposed upon her.
Ms Newham had attended a music festival on the previous Saturday at the Coast
at which she was drinking and sharing drinks with her
friends. She did not
specifically admit to taking Ecstasy on this occasion although she had indicated
to have taken it on some previous
occasions and the pathology report is evidence
of its presence in her system when tested on the Monday following the music
That substance showed in her urine sample on testing and the stewards
determined that it was irrelevant for the purposes of penalty
to identify
whether the level of concentration was high or low other than that such level
exceeded the threshold allowed under the
relevant Rules of Racing and the
protocols published thereunder. Ms Newham pleaded guilty and was disqualified
for a period of six
In her appearance before this Tribunal Ms Newham confirmed that her main
occupation was that of a track work rider and her only other
income was from
working in the stables of her mother one of the leading trainers of the Gold
Coast. The appellant is 23 years of
age and undertakes a University course and
has full-time employment with a valuation company. As part of her stable duties
also mentor to another young girl who is in need of assistance.
The stewards have embarked upon a strategy to eliminate the use of
recreational drugs in jockeys, track work riders and all other
associated with the Racing Industry particularly of those persons who are
involved in the riding and handling of thoroughbred
racehorses. It was for
these reasons that the stewards imposed a disqualification of effectively six
months identifying that the
industry does not want persons in the industry when
affected by drugs or alcohol.
The Tribunal has on previous occasions identified that it is necessary to act
reasonably when imposing penalties and in support the
stewards provided
information as to similar type penalties that had been imposed by stewards
outside Queensland. The most severe
appear to be those imposed in New South
Wales which can in certain instances exceed 12 months disqualification. It is
not, in this Tribunal’s opinion, appropriate that it embark on a
total rehearing of all of the issues other than to confirm
that the stewards
have acted reasonably and that the stewards have obviously taken into account
the representations made by the appellant
in the early stages of the Inquiry as
to the appellant’s work history and future in the industry.
The Tribunal considers the penalty to be appropriate. It is not appropriate,
in the opinion of this Tribunal, to upset the penalty
and the appeal is
therefore dismissed and the deposit is forfeit.
Mr Leo Williams AO
Mr Brockwell Miller
Mr Dennis Standfield
