REASONS FOR
29 April 2013 the Tribunal published reasons for decision in which we concluded
that each of the particulars of the amended complaint
had been established; and
that such particulars not only constituted unsatisfactory professional conduct
by Dr Do but also constituted
professional misconduct.
made that determination, the Tribunal sat on 7 June 2013 for the purpose of
determining what the appropriate protective orders
ought to be made. Dr Do
appeared in person during most of the first stage of the hearing concerning the
question of whether the complaint
had been made out. She appeared by leave by
telephone link-up on 7 June 2013. The second stage of the hearing did not
conclude on
7 June 2013 but was stood over part heard to today.
Do has not appeared today either in person or by telephone link and, as was
noted at the commencement of the hearing today, it
is not the first occasion
where Dr Do has failed to make herself available for the purposes of these
proceedings.
the context of what appropriate protective orders ought to be made, Mr O'Donnell
of counsel (who appears for the complainant Commission)
has submitted today that
the absence of Dr Do should give rise to a finding that she is, at this stage of
the proceedings, exhibiting
an unwillingness to engage with the Tribunal. Mr
O'Donnell further points to the fact in this context that Dr Do did not provide
the reference or references requested of her by the Tribunal when it adjourned
these proceedings on 7 June 2013.
that, to a very considerable extent, Dr Do has vigorously participated at other
(but not at all) stages of the proceedings,
the Tribunal is unwilling on the
limited material available to it to draw such an adverse inference against Dr
Nevertheless
the Tribunal is in a position to proceed to determine the matter today.
Commission's primary submission is that Dr Do should, in effect, be disqualified
from practising medicine for a period of eighteen
months to two years from
today. She is presently not registered in any State of Australia, and the order
that the Commission seeks
in that respect is that any application for
registration be not accepted in that period.
a consequence of what fell from some of the Tribunal members on 7 June 2013, the
Commission has an alternative submission namely,
that if Dr Do applies for
registration in any State of Australia, any such registration be subject to
stringent conditions. The Commission
in that respect has helpfully drafted some
appropriate conditions.
Dr Do should, in effect, be deregistered (in the meaning of that expression as
we have explained it) is of course a very serious
the Tribunal's reasons for decision of 29 April 2013 will reveal, the Tribunal
was gravely concerned at the conduct of Dr Do in
her treatment of Mr Siebler -
treatment (it should be restated) which, indirectly at least, resulted in his
were many substantial departures from appropriate medical practice, as those
reasons will also reveal.
matter which has exercised the Tribunal's present thinking is whether those
substantial departures from satisfactory conduct represent
something more than
the paradigm of the relationship between Dr Do and Mr Siebler. That is to say,
whether those departures were
intimately connected with the intricacies of that
relationship such that, outside of that context, Dr Do otherwise has been a
satisfactory
medical practitioner.
is a question upon which the Tribunal is divided. Two members of the Tribunal
are firmly of the opinion that the departures from
acceptable medical practice
by Dr Do were such that, regardless of whether or not they are contained to the
treatment of Mr Siebler,
they justify effective disqualification or
deregistration for the period sought by the Commission in order to adequately
the community. Two other members of the Tribunal are of a different
opinion. They are of the opinion that there is no evidence to
suggest that Dr
Do's quite obvious failings in relation to Mr Siebler are more widely based; and
that the public could be adequately
protected by the imposition of rigorous
conditions, including a requirement that she be the subject of level 1
supervision if she
were to be registered.
division being of the kind we have referred to means that the prevailing view is
to be that of the Deputy Chairperson. In that
respect the Deputy Chairperson is
of the opinion that the public would be adequately protected if Dr Do, upon
application for registration,
were to be subject to the conditions proposed by
the Commission and level 1 supervision - with the following exception - in
of which of the members of the Tribunal are in agreement.
Tribunal is of the opinion that the proposed Health Records Course submitted by
the Commission today is an inappropriate condition
to impose on Dr Do. The
Tribunal is of that view for two reasons. First, on the limited information
available to the Tribunal, the
course contended for seems more suitable for a
lay practice manager of a medical practice rather than for a medical
practitioner.
Secondly, and more importantly, if Dr Do is registered subject to
supervision on the other conditions proposed by the Commission,
and at level 1,
she will be subject almost daily to intense and constant supervision in relation
to her record keeping by her supervisor.
That, it seems to the Tribunal, is a
more effective manner of addressing that issue.
Tribunal therefore directs the Commission to bring in Short Minutes of Order
giving effect to the Tribunal's decision which is
to the effect as we have
stated. It is expected that those Short Minutes will be comprehensive so as to
embrace any application by
Dr Do in any jurisdiction of Australia.
Tribunal also orders Dr Do to pay the complainant's costs of the amended
complaint, excluding the costs directly involved in the
previous hearing
presided over by Deputy Chairperson Kavanagh J (see Health Care Complaints
Commission v Dr Annette Do [2013] NSWMT
7 at [12] ff).
Annexed to these Reasons for Decision are the Short Minutes of Order
subsequently provided to the Tribunal and which are incorporated
by reference to
these Reasons. They are therefore to be published with these
