“Does the punishment fit the crime? James Hardie case final
By Professor Michael Adams, UWS Law School
In April 2009 the NSW Supreme Court handed
down an important decision for
all governance
professionals. The case involved James Hardie
(JHI) and went under the title of ASIC v
Macdonald (No 11)[2009] NSWSC 287.

breaches and also to
focus on the issue of costs, a critical factor in
major litigation.
On 20 August 2009, Gzell J handed down the
penalty proceedings in ASIC v
Macdonald (No 12)
[2009] NSWSC 714
, which added a further 88
judgment to the original 194-page
judgment in April. Penalty judgments are
normally reasonably short and succinct, but Gzell
J obviously wanted to
make it crystal-clear why he
had decided to impose certain penalties and how
he had arrived at certain conclusions.
The most recent JHI case has generated a lot of
publicity in the
mainstream media and quite
rightly has drawn public criticism for what seem
to be very light penalties for serious breaches of
Corporations Act
This article attempts to
provide an objective analysis of the case and its
outcomes. One important factor to note is that
this was a civil case
rather than a criminal case.
In early 2007, ASIC commenced a civil penalty
action against the original
JHI company, its new
incarnation based in the Netherlands (JHI NV) and
the ten directors. The matter was also referred to
the Commonwealth
Director of Public
Prosecutions (CDPP). In September 2008 the CDPP
determined that there was insufficient evidence to
pursue a criminal
prosecution. Thus, no director
was going to be heavily fined or sent to
breaching the
Corporations Act
The main case against JHI and its directors
hinged around a media release
made to the
Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in February
stated that the establishment of a
trust fund for asbestos victims of JHI
products was
fully funded by an injection of $293 million.
Unfortunately, as the Special Commission of
Inquiry, chaired by Mr David
Jackson QC, found
that by the end of 2003 the trust would in fact
$1.5 billion in assets to provide for all the
asbestos-related claims. The
current JHI NV
continued to make assertions that the trust was
funded, which was false and misleading to
investors of JHI. Additionally,
the executive
directors (CEO, company secretary/general counsel
and the seven non-executive directors,
were all in breach of their duty of
care as officers
Corporations Act
) for approving the
make such a misleading statement.
A number of the non-executive directors tried to
argue that they were
unaware of the media
statement to the ASX and that this was a general
management issue that would not normally be
approved by the board of
directors. As such, they
argued that they should be granted court relief
under s 1817S or
Gzell J stated that this
document was so
critical to the whole process of
reorganising JHI to move from Australia to
Netherlands by way of the scheme of arrangement, that all the directors
had a role in the final version. The judge noted that the
relief provisions are
based around officers acting honestly and having regard for all the
circumstances. The court has a very wide
discretion in applying the
relief provisions and
determined that they should not be applied.
media release, which was actually entitled
‘James Hardie resolves
asbestos liability favourably
for claimants and shareholders’ on 16
2001 made three separate statements as to
sufficiency of funds
to meet all future claims of
asbestos related diseases from JHI products. At
paragraph 104 of the JHI penalties judgment,
Gzell J states that:
This was a serious breach of duty and a flagrant
one. The non-executive
directors were endorsing
JHIL’s announcement to market in emphatic
terms that the Foundation had sufficient funds to
pay all legitimate
present and future asbestos
claims, when they had no sufficient support for
that statement and they knew, or ought to have
known, that the
announcement would influence
the market.
It was a negligently misleading statement to
deliberately attempt to
influence the market to
accept the relevant subsidiaries with asbestos
claims would be separated from JHI group.
What were the outcomes to this
important case, which has reignited
the debate on corporate social
responsibility over the more
corporate governance
concepts? Well, the first surprise
was that the old
JHI that was found
to have six contravention of
Corporations Act
misleading conduct, false
statements as to securities and
continuous disclosure was
exempted from liability under the
known James Hardie (Civil
Liability) Act 2005(NSW). So although the old JHI
is now known as ABN 60 Pty Ltd and is in a
winding up for the next 40
years, the court could
not impose any damages or liabilities on it.
The current company, JHI NV, which was
found to have three single
breaches of the law for
misleading conduct, false statements as to
securities and continuous disclosure received a
mere $80,000 civil
pecuniary penalty (similar to a
fine, but not criminal). By any standard
similar to a parking ticket and thus does not act as
a deterrent
nor a real punishment. Additionally,
no compensation or damages order was
thus the victims of asbestos from JHI products
greater funds to the trust.
The CEO, Peter Macdonald, was heavily
criticised in the original judgment
for his lack of
advice to the board in respect of the media
and in particular failing to explain the
expert reports provided by Access
Economics, PwC
and the actuaries, Trowbridge. The court found
had contravened s 180 duty of care ten
times. This included the original
media release
and the repeating of the statements at investor
in the UK. Thus, the penalty should be
a pecuniary penalty of $350,000 and a
disqualification order of 15 years from being
involved in the management
of a company. ASIC
had requested a million-plus dollar fine. This
penalty appears to fit the breach of law and is on
par with what Ray
Williams and Rodney Adler
received for their conduct in the HIH case.
The company secretary and general counsel, Peter
Shafron, was found to
have contravened s180
duty of care six times and in particular for failing
to explain the meaning and consequences of the
expert reports, in
relation to the media release.
The court determined that a financial penalty
$75,000 and seven-year disqualification was
appropriate. This is on
the lighter end of the range
of expectation, but similar to major
litigations
such as the HIH case and the
One.Tel case. The CFO, Philip
Morley, who only was found to have
breaches a single provision, s 180,
was banned for five years and a mere
$35,000. For an executive director,
this is very much on the light end of
the scale of punishments that can
provided. It is worth noting for a
single breach of s 180, the
maximum fine is $200,000 and the
maximum disqualification period is
five years.
The seven non-executive
directors, including the Chairman,
Hellicar, were all found to have a single
breach of s 180
Corporations Act
That is that they
failed to take reasonable care in allowing the
to make the relevant media statement to
the ASX in respect of fully funding
of the asbestos
claims against JHI. Gzell J determined to impose
maximum disqualification period of five years
on all seven directors. This
means that all JHI
directors must resign from their current board
positions (many have done so already) and they
may not be in the senior
management of any
company in Australia. This does pose questions in
respect of the directors taking positions overseas
prohibition is not necessarily applied.
However, in respect of the financial
consequences, the pecuniary penalty
(fines) was
limited to just $30,000 each. This is extremely low
the maximum $200,000 per contravention
and also for other directors that
have been found to
have breached
There is not, in my opinion, a
clear rationale, as to why the judge has stated such a
relative to the breach of law. It was
certainly far below market
expectations and that of
the general public, causing some public outcry, as
one would expect. The damage to reputation and
the imposing a maximum
period of disqualification,
may be seen by the court as more important that
the lack of impact of any fine or financial penalty.
The case also raises some interesting questions in
respect of court
costs. It has been stated that JHI has
spent approximately $25 million on
the case and
ASIC must have spent a few million bringing the
court. Gzell J did order some costs towards
ASIC, but the amounts have not
been specified and
they relate to a very narrow range of the more
technical breaches rather than the broad directors
duties under
There have also been questions
of corporate indemnities and the role of
and officers insurance in the case. Finally, from the
judgment, the defendants have 28 days to
lodge an appeal. A number of the
non-executive
directors have indicated they might appeal and we
have to wait and see what happens.
This article asked the basic question, whether the
punishment in the JHI case fits the crime? Well it is
not really the
right question, as the case was a civil
penalty case rather than a criminal
case. However, it
is fair to say that the outcomes — the
disqualifications and the fines — were certainly
expectations of many people. It is
important to note that the judge did
maximum disqualification period across the
directors and this
would have a severe impact on
their livelihoods, as well as reputations.
act as a serious warning to all executives and non-
directors. But the lack of any
compensation (damages) and the low level of
(except for Peter Macdonald) does not act as a
barrier to any
director from failing to take
reasonable care in executing their duties.
