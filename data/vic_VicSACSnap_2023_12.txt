Sentencing Snapshot 284: Sentencing Trends for Incest in the Higher Courts
of Victoria 2017-18 to 2021-22
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of
in the County and Supreme
Courts of Victoria (the higher courts) from 2017-18 to
Adjustments made by the
Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at December 2022 have been
incorporated into the data in this
Detailed data on incest and other offences is available on
A person who engages in an act of sexual penetration with a person whom they
know to be their child, step-child or lineal descendant
is guilty of incest.
Similarly, a person who takes part in an act of sexual penetration with a person
whom they know to be the child,
step-child or lineal descendant of their spouse
or domestic partner is also guilty of incest.
Incest is an indictable offence that carries a maximum penalty of 25 years'
imprisonment and/or 3,000 penalty
Incest is a category 1 offence if it was committed on or after 20 March 2017
and the victim was under 18 years old. For this offence,
this classification
means that courts must always impose a custodial
Incest is also a standard
sentence offence if it was committed on or after 1 February 2018 and the victim
was under 18 years old.
This means that courts must take into account that a
prison sentence of 10 years represents the middle of the range of objective
seriousness for this offence.
This Snapshot focuses on cases where incest was the principal offence, that
is, cases where incest was the offence that received the
most severe
Incest was the principal offence in 1.4% of cases sentenced in the higher
courts between 2017-18 and 2021-22.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced since March 2020 may be lower than in previous years because
the pandemic caused delays in court proceedings;
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases and therefore higher
imprisonment rates than in previous years;
prison sentences
may be shorter than in previous years to reflect the combined effect of:
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The Queen
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the justice system;
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2017-18 to 2021-22, 117 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of incest.
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
incest by financial year. There were 24 people sentenced
for this offence in
2021-22, up from 22 in the previous year. The number of people sentenced was
highest in 2019-20 (30 people) and
lowest in 2018-19 (17 people). There were 22
people whose offending attracted standard sentence offence classification.

immediate custodial sentence.

Principal and total effective sentences of imprisonment
The following sections analyse the use of
imprisonment for the offence of incest from 2017-18 to 2021-22.
The principal sentence describes sentences for the offence at a
The total effective sentence is the sentence imposed for all charges in a
case and applies at a
level. Where a case involves multiple charges,
the total effective sentence will be either the same as or longer than the
Principal sentences of imprisonment
Of the 113 principal sentences of imprisonment for
incest, 112 were non-aggregate imprisonment terms, that is, the imprisonment
were not part of an aggregate
Figure 3 shows the imprisonment lengths for those 112 non-aggregate
imprisonment terms. Imprisonment lengths ranged from 3 years to
while the median
imprisonment length was 6 years.
The most common range of imprisonment lengths was 6 to less than 7 years (28
principal sentences).

Figure 4 shows the average imprisonment lengths for the principal offence of
incest. The average imprisonment length ranged from 5
years and 9 months in
2017-18 to 7 years and 2 months in 2020-21. Over the five years, the average
imprisonment length for incest
was 6 years and 7 months. For the 22 charges
subject to the standard sentence, the average imprisonment length was 7 years
The imprisonment lengths for incest as a standard sentence offence are
presented separately because courts sentencing standard sentence
offences 'must
only have regard to sentences previously imposed for the offence as a standard
sentence offence'.
sentencing non-standard sentence offences must have regard to sentences imposed
when the offence both was and was not a standard
sentence offence.

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an imprisonment term of
less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the discretion to fix
a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
years or more, the court must
impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.
Of the 113 people who were sentenced to imprisonment for incest, all were
eligible to have a non-parole period fixed and all received
one. The length of
non-parole period could not be determined for 1

lengths of non-parole periods for the other 112 people. Non-parole periods
ranged from 1 year to 19 years, while

The most common ranges of non-parole periods were 5 to less than 6 years and
6 to less than 7 years (15 people each).

Other offences finalised at the same hearing
Sometimes people prosecuted for incest face multiple
charges, which are finalised at the same hearing. This section looks at the
of offences that offenders were sentenced for alongside the principal
offence of incest.
Figure 9 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
incest by the total number of sentenced offences per person.
The number of
sentenced offences per person ranged from 1 to 26, and the median was 5
offences. There were 10 people (8.5%) sentenced
for the single offence of
incest. The average number of offences per person was 6.4.

Table 2 shows the 10 most common offences co-sentenced alongside incest. The
last column sets out the average number of offences sentenced
per person. For
example, 71 of the total 117 people (60.7%) also received sentences for indecent
act with or in the presence of a
child under 16. On average, those 71 people
were sentenced for 3.1 charges of indecent act with or in the presence of a
child under
16 per case.

From 2017-18 to 2021-22, 117 people were sentenced
in the higher courts for incest. Of these people, 113 (96.6%) were given a

Total effective sentences ranged from 3 years to 25 years, and non-parole
periods ranged from 1 year to 19 years. The median total
effective sentence was
9 years, while the median principal sentence of imprisonment was 6 years.
On average, people sentenced for incest were found guilty of 6.4 offences
each, with a maximum of 26 offences.
Of the 22 principal offences of incest subject to the standard sentence in
this period, all received an imprisonment term. The average
imprisonment length
for those 22 principal offences was 7 years and 3 months, which is higher than
the overall average of 6 years
and 7 months for the 112 principal offences that
received a non-aggregate imprisonment term during this period.
