APC UPDATE | 25 August 2014
Statement by the Executive Director about articles in
The Weekend Australian
The series of articles in The Weekend Australian (23-24 August 2014) about
the Australian Press Council included a number of inaccuracies
misrepresentations. Some of these matters are addressed in this statement and
others will be dealt with when the Council’s
other obligations permit.
Chair’s withdrawal from adjudications about News
Corp publications
The Weekend Australian reported (on page 8) the decision by the Chair of the
Council to withdraw from any Press Council adjudications
publications which may arise at the only session of adjudications he will be
chairing before he leaves the Council
in a few months’ time.
It reported that News Corp publications had demanded his withdrawal from two
current matters. Despite its length, however, the report
failed to mention the
Council statement that neither the relevant Vice Chair of the Council (a former
Chief Justice) nor the Executive
Director considered the demands were
It also omitted the Chair’s own statement that, while agreeing the
demands were unjustified, he believed that the Council could
not afford to have
its complaints work subjected to the further severe disruption which would flow
from resisting them and related
misrepresentations.
The Chair’s letter to the Editor pointing out these omissions was
published today. It was altered very significantly, however,
by removal of the
reference to the Vice Chair being a former Chief Justice and excluding the
reference to the severity of the disruption.
Article about the Chair and freedom of speech
The Weekend Australian article (on pages 1 and 8) about the Council, the
Chair and freedom of speech contained too many misrepresentations
corrected in detail here. But perhaps one correction can serve as an
Neither the Council nor the Chair has sought the power for it to fine
newspapers. That was made clear in a written submission and
orally to the
Finkelstein inquiry, as well as in the Chair’s evidence at the Senate
committee hearing on Senator Conroy’s
Bill. The Chair has also stated it
on many other public and private occasions, often with News Corp in
attendance.
Complaint about kangaroo meat article
Another Weekend Australian article (on page 8) concerned a complaint made to
the Council about an earlier article in The Australian
on kangaroo meat. In
doing so, it disclosed details of the complaint process which is still under
way. Similar disclosures occurred
in another article about this matter, which
was published in The Australian on Friday 22 August.
The newspaper agreed that it breached its obligations of confidentiality.
These obligations, often insisted upon by newspapers, are
for the protection of
all people and organisations involved in the process while it is still under
The Council cannot respond in detail now to the two articles without itself
breaching confidentiality. But it can make the general
statement that neither
the subject matter of the complaint nor the way in which it is being handled has
been reported accurately.
