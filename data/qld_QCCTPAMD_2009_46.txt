REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is an application referred to the Tribunal by the Chief Executive under the
Agents and Motor Dealers Act
Act”). It is a claim by Danny Tong (“Mr Tong”) against the
claim fund established under the Act.
Mr Tong alleges that he suffered
financial loss because of the conduct of John Gary Ivanoff (“the
respondent”), a licensee.
respondent did not attend the hearing today. I am satisfied that he was given
notice of the hearing or that he cannot be located
and I intend to proceed in
his absence
Tong relies on the material contained in the file of the Office of Fair Trading,
which is in evidence before the Tribunal. That
material sets out the background
to the claim.
24 February 2008, Mr Tong went to Park ’n Sell Miami (“the
yard”) where he spoke to the respondent, who told
him that he was a
licensed motor dealer and the owner of the yard. A sign displayed in the front
of the business carried a license
number on it. The applicant expressed interest
in a Hi Lux Ute (“the vehicle”) which had an asking price of
$17,000.00.
29 February 2009 the applicant and his partner returned to the yard to buy the
vehicle. Mr Tong agreed with the respondent that
he would pay for the vehicle by
a payment of $14,500.00 and by trade in of his VH Holden Commodore sedan. Mr
Tong received a receipt
for the sum of $14,500.00 and he signed documents
transferring his Holden Commodore sedan. The respondent did not provide any
or paperwork for Mr Tong to sign. The respondent told Mr Tong that the
vehicle was owned by a finance company, but that the purchase
price would pay
that out. Mr Tong asked him to send to him a payout document and the respondent
said that he would. On 3 March
Mr Tong paid $319.50 to register the vehicle
with Queensland Transport.
late August 2008 a repossession agent visited the applicant to repossess the
vehicle which Mr Tong believed that he owned. On 9
October 2008, the vehicle was
repossessed by Esanda who was not aware of its sale to Mr Tong.
Legislation
of the Act provides:
“Guarantee of title for motor vehicles
(1) This section applies if a used motor vehicle is to be sold by or for a
motor dealer (selling agent) to someone else (buyer), other
than by auction.
If the sale is by auction,
section 233
of title for motor vehicles) applies.
(2) The following person (the responsible motor dealer) must ensure the
buyer gains clear title to the motor vehicle at the time property
in the vehicle
passes to the buyer--
(a) if the selling agent owns the motor vehicle or is appointed to sell
the vehicle on consignment for someone other than another
motor dealer or
auctioneer--the selling agent;
(b) if the selling agent is selling the motor vehicle for another motor
dealer or auctioneer--the other motor dealer or auctioneer
for whom the selling
agent is selling the vehicle. “
(a) of the Act states:
“(1) A person may make a
claim against the fund if the person suffers financial loss because of the
happening of any of the
following events--
(a) the contravention of
any of the following provisions by a relevant person--
section 295(2)
(1) (c) of the Act states:
“(1) A person may make a
claim against the fund if the person suffers financial loss because of the
happening of any of the
following events--
(c) a failure of a motor dealer to ensure a person who has bought a motor
vehicle sold by or for the dealer gains clear title to the
vehicle at the time
property in the vehicle passes to the buyer, whether or not the motor dealer
contravenes
section 233
is clear from the facts that the respondent failed to ensure that Mr Tong gained
clear title to the vehicle, contrary to
sections 295
(1) (c) of the Act.
The respondent comes within the definition of “motor dealer”
Tong has provided documentary evidence of the sum of $14,500.00 paid for the
vehicle. The evidence satisfies me that he also transferred
to the respondent
his Holden Commodore at a worth of $2,500.00 to make up the balance price for
the vehicle. He is entitled to be
reimbursed for that. Mr Tong’s total
financial loss because of the conduct of the respondent is the sum of
$17,319.50, being
the consideration he gave for the vehicle and the sum of
$319.50 which he paid to register it.
claim in the sum of $17,319.50 is allowed.
person liable for Mr Tong’s financial loss is the respondent, John Gary
applicant’s claim against the fund is allowed in the sum of
$17,319.50.00.
person liable for the applicant’s financial loss is the respondent, John
Gary Ivanoff.
