Edited by Lilian Edwards and Charlotte Waeldend,
Internet: A Framework for Electronic Commerce,
Hart Publishing, Portland,

This second edition follows up on the first edition:
Internet: Regulating Cyberspace
(1997), which was a collection of essays
aimed at demystifying the Internet and analysing its impact on the legal
profession. This
is a rapidly evolving area of law, and the second edition is
almost entirely revamped.
The book starts with
The Internet: An Introduction for Lawyers,
written by Andrew Terrett and Iain Monaghan. This chapter has been substantially
rewritten since the first edition. The authors offer
a detailed description of
the physical and virtual layers of the Internet, and introduce the techno-jargon
that computers and the
Internet seem to attract. It also offers an overview of
the legislative issues and trends that are arising in the area of ecommerce
the Internet, although the in-depth analysis is left for later chapters to
Part 1 of the book addresses ecommerce issues, with four essays related to
business on the web. The first essay considers some of
the legal ramifications
of entering into contracts electronically over the web. The author, Andrew D
Murray, develops the law of
contract to encompass this new communication medium,
and considers factors such as contract formation, the postal acceptance rule
e-mail acceptances, and incorporation of express and implied terms. Particular
attention is paid to cross-border transactions
and the question of where the
contract is formed, and of what law is applicable.
The remaining three chapters in Part 1 consider data privacy and security.
Martin Hogg analyses the British Government’s Electronic
Communications
Act 2000 and its application to cryptography, encryption and electronic
signatures. Saul Miller follows this with
a discussion about electronic payment,
and raises some of the statutory provisions regulating use of credit cards.
These are then
compared with debit cards and with the Mondex Digital Cash
system, with the legal protections for consumers being analysed. Andrew
Charlesworth sums up Part 1 with a consideration of ‘Data Privacy in
Cyberspace’, looking at privacy provisions particularly
in the EU and the
USA. The pace of development in this area of law is demonstrated by the need for
an addendum to the chapter citing
developments since it was written.
Part 2 of the book is devoted to ‘Intellectual Property on the
Internet’. William Black starts with a description of the
Name System (DNS)’ and the way this system is managed. Charlotte Waelde
follows on from this with two chapters
discussing the commercial significance of
the domain name and the overlap with trade marks and trading names. The Trade
1994 (UK) provides the statutory background for the discussion of
trade marks and the use of domain names. Again, this is an area
that the author
notes is continually changing and developing, and her second chapter considers
forthcoming issues in trade mark disputes,
focussing on some recent cases from
Chapter 9 of the book is written by Hector L MacQueen, and is a discussion of
‘Copyright and the Internet’. This very
topical issue considers
MP3s), videos and libraries.
The author examines the legal provisions relating
to information on the Internet, and the law that is developing to protect the
intellectual
property while also allowing reasonable reproduction by libraries,
educational institutions and museums. The final chapter in Part
2 is by Paul
Torremans, and analyses Internet disputes about copyright and choice of
Part 3 of the book relates to ‘Content Liability’. Lilian Edwards
opens with three chapters: the first on’ Defamation
Internet’, with a particular focus on the liability of Internet service
providers. Her second chapter analyses ‘Pornography
Internet’, and the legislative measures being taken to regulate the
pornographic content of Cyberspace, while still
allowing free speech and civil
liberties. Her third chapter looks at junk electronic mail, and considers the
need for the legal regulation
of this medium. Paul Carlyle finishes with a
discussion of ‘Legal Regulation of Telecommunications’, and the
impact this
is having on the provision of Internet services.
Since the contributors are all based in the UK, the book is largely based on
law derived from the UK. However, the editors do note
that the USA still sets
the benchmarks for ecommerce in the world, and as such, there is reference to
laws and cases from that jurisdiction.
There is also reference to law from the
European Union countries, and Australia, where Lilian Edwards completed a
sabbatical in 1999.
The book is easy to read, and despite the numerous authors, has been well
edited with the result that it flows smoothly through the
various topics. While
each chapter could be developed into an entire text on each subject, the book
provides a worthwhile overview
of this developing area of law throughout the
world. The statement of law in the second edition is much more developed than in
first, and with the speed of change in this area of law, it won’t be
long before publication of the third edition is warranted.
