Introduction
compensatory principle in tort entitles an injured party to compensation in a
sum which, so far as money can do, will put that
party in the same position as
they would have been in if the tort had not been committed. In
Stephen JJ referred to the "touchstone of reasonableness" when assessing
compensation for a plaintiff's nursing and medical
care following the negligence
of a defendant. This appeal concerns reasonableness in the proof and assessment
of loss where an injured
party claims damages on the basis that they will or
wish to live in their own home or in a home setting rather than in an
institution
or in an institutional setting.
appellant, Mr Stewart, was catastrophically injured as a result of the
negligence of the respondent ("MNHHS"). Prior to his injury
he lived at his own
the time of trial, he was being
cared for in an institution without his son and
dog. He was miserable at the institution and his physical health was
deteriorating,
in part due to lack of engagement with therapy. He sought
compensation for his losses, including the cost of nursing and medical
(rented) home of his own where his son and dog could stay.
the Supreme Court of Queensland, the trial judge held that Mr Stewart could
recover for the cost of nursing and medical care at
the institution and for the
additional cost of an external care assistant to provide more frequent therapy
and exercise. But, balancing
any benefits to his physical health against the
substantial increase in the cost of care if Mr Stewart were to reside and
the required care in his own (rented) home, the trial judge held that an
award of compensation to reflect that increased cost would
be unreasonable. The
Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Queensland upheld that balancing
exercise in terms of both the reasoning
and the conclusion.
approach taken to reasonableness was erroneous. The proper starting point was
that Mr Stewart was entitled to compensation in
a sum which, so far as
money can do, would put him in the same position as he would have been in had
MNHHS not acted negligently.
From that starting point, Mr Stewart was
required to prove that his choice to live and receive the required care in a
rented home
of his own, rather than in an institution or an institutional
setting, was a reasonable response to repair the consequences of the
tort and to
restore him to his position prior to the tort. The evaluation of the
reasonableness of Mr Stewart's response was not
discharged by balancing
only the health benefits against the increased cost. In his circumstances, the
choice of home care by Mr
Stewart was a reasonable means of repairing the
consequences of the tort. MNHHS did not establish that part or all of that
cost of home care could be avoided but for an unreasonable decision by
Mr Stewart to refuse a proffered alternative option. The appeal
Background facts
2016, prior to the events that are the subject of this litigation,
Mr Stewart was 63 years old and living in the Queensland coastal
Margate. Mr Stewart lived in a property which he shared with, and paid rent
to, his brother. Mr Stewart had separated from
his wife (and now litigation
guardian), Ms Schwarzman, in 2008 but they remained on good terms.
Mr Stewart and Ms Schwarzman shared
the custody of their only child,
14-year-old son Jesse. Mr Stewart loved animals and he shared the love of
family dogs with Ms Schwarzman
March and April 2016, Mr Stewart sought treatment at Redcliffe Hospital in
Queensland for nausea and generalised abdominal
pain. He was treated negligently
and MNHHS accepted liability for that negligence. As a consequence of the
negligence, Mr Stewart
suffered numerous injuries including bowel
perforations, sepsis, cardiac arrest, and stroke. Mr Stewart was left with
many injuries
including brain damage, pain on the right side of his body with no
active movement in the right upper limb, the need for a colostomy
bag, and right
lower limb contractures. As a 71-year-old man at the time of trial in 2023 he
was found to have an estimated life
expectancy of five years.
November 2016, Mr Stewart was discharged from hospital to a nursing home.
In March 2017, Mr Stewart was transferred to Ozanam
Villa Aged Care
Facility ("Ozanam"), where he remained at the time of trial. At the time of
trial, Ms Schwarzman and Jesse had a
dog called Sasha who would sit on
Mr Stewart's lap or on Mr Stewart's bed. But Mr Stewart was not
permitted to keep a dog at Ozanam.
Mr Stewart also alleged that Jesse was
not permitted to stay, and it is clear that, at the least, it was very difficult
to stay. Although Jesse gave evidence that he "just would love to stay
... with my dad overnight" at Ozanam, over the course of six
years before trial
Jesse was only able to stay overnight in an unoccupied room at Ozanam for one
night at Christmas in 2017 or 2018.
Even a visit to Ozanam by Jesse generally
required advance notice of one day.
Mr Stewart's
physical condition deteriorated at Ozanam as a consequence of lack of therapy
and exercise. At trial, Mr Stewart claimed
that he intended to move from
Ozanam to his own residence (a rental apartment or rental home) and that his
medical, health, social,
and nursing needs were not being well met at Ozanam.
There is no remaining dispute that Mr Stewart intended to use a sufficient
of compensation for that purpose. The central issue in dispute at trial
and on appeal was expressed as whether it was "reasonable"
for the damages
awarded to Mr Stewart to include a component for medical and nursing care
and treatment of Mr Stewart in his own
(rented) home.
The decisions of the trial judge and the Court of
The evidence and findings about Mr Stewart's wishes
Mr Stewart's constrained ability to express himself due to the impact of
his receptive and expressive aphasia, there was
a substantial volume of evidence
at trial that Mr Stewart wished to live in his own home rather than at
Ozanam. As the trial judge
(Cooper J) noted, that evidence included:
(i) Mr Stewart's "tendency to immerse himself in photographs from his
past life and possessions";
(ii) Mr Stewart's communication by sounds
and gestures to Ms Schwarzman that he would like to stay in a home where
Jesse and a dog
could stay with him and that he did not want to stay at Ozanam;
(iii) Mr Stewart's communication to Dr Rotinen Diaz (a
rehabilitation
physician) by "a very clear verbal and non verbal answer" that he
did not want to live in a nursing home and wanted to live in a
private dwelling,
and "a very strong and clear 'no'" indicating that he was not happy at Ozanam;
and (iv) Mr Stewart's facial expressions
communicating answers to
Ms Coles (an occupational therapist) that he wished to live in his own
the trial judge had concern about whether Mr Stewart had a "full
understanding" of all the potential difficulties that a
move to his own home
might involve, the trial judge accepted the evidence from Ms Coles that
Mr Stewart had "clearly communicated
his desire to live in his own home
rather than at Ozanam", a decision supported by Ms Coles on the basis that
it would improve Mr
Stewart's quality of

Mr Stewart that would come from living in his own
Diaz described Mr Stewart's environment as a crucial factor in
Mr Stewart's motivation for therapy and considered
that with comprehensive
care and therapy Mr Stewart would see functional improvements in his health
and physical condition. Ms McCorkell
(a neurological physiotherapist)
expressed the opinion that Mr Stewart's "health outcome would be better if
he resided in his own
"through the presence of a family member or a pet during therapy". Dr
(a psychiatrist) concluded that Mr Stewart's mental health would benefit in
the medium to long term from living in his own home.
And Ms Coles and
Ms Coventry (also an occupational therapist) gave evidence that they did
not consider it to be in Mr Stewart's best
interests to stay at Ozanam
because they considered that there was a lack of specialised equipment and a
lack of ongoing and regular

and Dr Gray that additional care and therapy would result
in improvements
in Mr Stewart's physical and mental health including addressing the
deconditioning and decreased mobility that Mr
Stewart had experienced at
The trial judge also
considered it likely that the provision of care and therapy to Mr Stewart
in his own home would increase his
willingness to "move from his bed to
participate in activities of interest". The trial judge described Jesse's
presence as a "powerful
motivator" for Mr Stewart to get out of bed and to
engage in therapy and referred to Jesse's evidence that he wished to live with
his father for the first few months after the move and then to live back and
forth between his father and his

"In the end, I am satisfied that the provision of comprehensive care and therapy
to Mr Stewart in his own home would result in health
benefits for
Mr Stewart. I do not consider that those health benefits can properly be
characterised as slight or speculative. This
is not a case where the benefit to
Mr Stewart of receiving care and therapy in his own home is entirely one of
The trial judge's reasons concerning compensation
trial judge considered three options for Mr Stewart. The first was the cost
of Mr Stewart's current care at Ozanam, for a period
of life expectancy of
five years. That total cost, as discounted, was $304,650.46. The second was the
cost of care at Ozanam for
that period with an external care assistant and the
provision of more frequent therapy and exercise. That total cost, as discounted,
was $1,081,895.56. The third was the cost for Mr Stewart to be cared for in
his own (rented) home for the remainder of his life.
That total cost, as
discounted including for future contingencies, was
$4,910,342.52.
to the first option, in light of the deterioration of Mr Stewart's
condition at Ozanam and his decreased mobility from a lack
of therapy and
exercise, the trial judge rejected a submission by MNHHS that the physical
health benefits to Mr Stewart from care
and therapy in his own home would
be no better than those he obtained from the care that he was receiving at
to the second and third options, the trial judge concluded that although the
second option would not achieve the enhancement of
Mr Stewart's quality of
life that would be achieved by the third option of living in his own home with
Jesse and a dog, the likely
health benefits of the third option were not
"significantly better" than those of the second option. This conclusion was,
substantially qualified. In order for Mr Stewart to engage with
frequent exercise and activities in the community, the external care
provided under the second option would need to develop a positive rapport with
Mr Stewart and Mr Stewart would need to
be engaged by the external
care assistant to a much greater degree than had previously been the
The trial judge
found that the "consistent provision of additional care from external care
assistants ... would be likely to engage
him to a much greater degree" than the
existing arrangements at Ozanam and would in turn "be likely to ... provide
health benefits
similar to those which he would receive if he was to be cared
for in his own
trial judge weighed the health benefits to Mr Stewart under the second and
third options against the difference in cost of those
options and concluded that
his Honour was "not satisfied that it would be likely to result in health
benefits for Mr Stewart that
are significantly better than those likely to
be achieved at Ozanam with additional therapy and a dedicated external care
assistant".
concluded that it was "not ... reasonable to require that the MNHHS pay the
significant additional cost that would be
involved in Mr Stewart moving
from Ozanam into his own
matters should be noted about that reasoning. First, in focusing on "health
benefits", the trial judge appears to be referring
to the benefits to
Mr Stewart's health including mental health benefits but not any benefit to
him that was "entirely one of
Secondly, in
comparing the relative health benefits of Mr Stewart living at home with
the benefits of living at Ozanam, the trial
judge assumed that there was an onus
on Mr Stewart to satisfy the Court that the former are "significantly
better" than the latter.
Thirdly, his Honour did not expressly address whether Mr Stewart's
choice to live and receive care at home was a reasonable one,
although the
earlier findings would suggest that his Honour would accept that it was
reasonable.
explained below, this was the wrong approach to the issue of reasonableness in
the assessment of compensation.
total amount of damages awarded by the trial judge was $2,190,505.48, before
management fees.
The Court of Appeal's reasons concerning compensation
Mr Stewart's
grounds of appeal from the decision of the trial judge included a challenge to
the trial judge's conclusion that it
was not reasonable for MNHHS to pay the
additional costs for Mr Stewart to have care in his own home.
Mr Stewart relied upon factors
including: (i) his expressed wish to be
cared for in a residence that he could share with Jesse and a dog, similar to
the arrangements
prior to his injury; (ii) such care arrangements being of
a kind commonly undertaken in the community; (iii) his living arrangements
being in the community prior to the tort; and (iv) the significant
psychological and emotional benefits to him, as described in the
uncontradicted
evidence of Dr Rotinen Diaz.
the leading reasons in the Court of Appeal, Boddice JA (with whom
Mullins P and Ryan J agreed) took a similar approach to the
judge when considering reasonableness in the assessment of damages, asking
whether the expenses were, or would be, "reasonably
his Honour rightly observed that "matters of amenities" should be
considered when assessing reasonableness in this manner,
Boddice JA upheld
the reasoning and the conclusion of the trial judge which had assessed the
reasonableness of the expenses that
Mr Stewart proposed to incur by
balancing the cost of those expenses with the physical health benefits that
would result.
His Honour considered that the difference in physical health benefits
between the second and third options considered by the trial
judge would be
"practically removed" by an increased level of engagement from Mr Stewart
with the additional care and assistance
provided by an external care
premise that the physical health benefits of the second and third options were
substantially the same had been heavily qualified
by the trial judge.
Boddice JA essentially recognised the heavily qualified nature of the trial
judge's finding by concluding that
"it had not been established, on the balance
of probabilities, that living in his own home with Jesse and a dog, would be
to result in health benefits for Mr Stewart that are significantly
better than those likely to be achieved [at Ozanam],
with additional therapy
and a dedicated external care
Mr Stewart nor MNHHS could establish the extent to which the third option
would have better physical health effects than
the basis that the second and third options had substantially the same physical
health benefits, his Honour held that the significant
difference in cost
meant that the option of home care was not
reasonable.
As a result,
the appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal also amended the award of damages
made by the trial judge to $2,171,244.03
on the agreed basis that there had
previously been a
miscalculation.
this Court, the sole ground of appeal upon which special leave was granted to
Mr Stewart asserted that the Court of Appeal erred
in its consideration of
reasonableness by failing to take into account four of the factors, set out
above, upon which Mr Stewart
had relied in the Court of Appeal. In written
and oral submissions, Mr Stewart asserted that the essence of this error
was that the
Court of Appeal asked the wrong question in relation to
reasonableness. That submission should be accepted. As explained below, the
question that should have been asked was whether Mr Stewart's choice to
live at home was a reasonable response to repair the consequences
of the tort.
If so, it was for MNHHS to show that part or all of the cost arising from that
choice should have been, or should be,
avoided by reasonable steps by
Mr Stewart to mitigate that loss.
The principles of
reasonableness in damages for torts
"compensatory principle" in the law of torts has been expressed on many
occasions for close to a century and a

this Court expressed it in
principle is that:
"the injured party should receive compensation in a sum which, so far as money
can do, will put that party in the same position as
he or she would have been in
if ... the tort had not been committed".
compensatory principle thus aims, so far as money can do, to rectify wrongful
acts and to repair their
consequences.
two different ways in which the concept of "reasonableness" limits the
application of the compensatory principle. The first
is concerned with proof of
consequential loss. In order to recover compensation for consequential losses
that have been or will be
incurred by some action of the plaintiff, the
plaintiff must prove those losses by proving the reasonable
of steps that the
plaintiff has taken, or will

reasonable cost of those steps, it is for
the defendant to establish that the plaintiff failed to avoid or mitigate that

plaintiff] to take".

limit is a difference between "the issue of damages
for proof by the plaintiff
[and] the issue of mitigation for proof by the
defendant".
first limit ensures that the steps taken by the plaintiff are, objectively,
reasonably required to restore the position of the
plaintiff. The "first task"
is to "determine whether or not what is claimed is something which should be
provided by the defendant
as a reasonable consequence of the tort ... before
proceeding to calculate its

where a defendant's negligence prevented a plaintiff from conceiving, damages

costs thereby incurred must be

Sharman v Evans
focus of submissions in this case was the decision of this Court in
One reason for
the difficulty in application of this decision arises from the different
approaches taken in the various judgments.
Another arises because the conclusion
reached by the majority did not require their Honours to separate the two
different roles that
were played by reasonableness: (i) the reasonableness
of the plaintiff's choice to live with her mother full-time, despite the threat
to her health that that action posed; and (ii) the reasonableness of the
cost of living with her mother full-time when compared with
alternatives.

Evans was a 20-year-old woman who had grown up in Perth, living with her mother.
At the time of the accident, Ms Evans was studying
full-time at a Bible
College in Brisbane. She was catastrophically injured in a car accident in
western New South Wales. As a result
of the accident, she became a quadriplegic
and an epileptic. She lost the power of speech. She had difficulty breathing.

was eventually transferred to Perth, where she was treated at the Royal Perth
Hospital and moved to the Quadriplegic Centre
within that hospital. She was
accommodated within the Quadriplegic Centre at a cost of $20 per day,
which, over her life expectancy
of a minimum of 20 years, was found to have
a present value of $86,000. Ms Evans, however, submitted that damages
should be assessed
in accordance with her desire to live at home with her
mother. That cost, even without future medical services and necessary
renovations
to Ms Evans' mother's house, was found to have a present value
of $375,000.

that Ms Evans' wish to go home "should be respected"

In effect, the
trial judge held that it was impossible for Ms Evans to live a life
exclusively at her mother's home for the (at least)
20 years of life
expectancy upon which damages were calculated. The trial judge held that the
amount that should be awarded for care
on the basis that Ms Evans would
live partly at hospital and partly at home, and therefore including the cost of

considered that the periods in which Ms Evans would stay at her mother's
house "would necessarily
be relatively few" and said that the costs of those
stays were "not reasonably necessary in any real sense for the treatment and
care of [Ms Evans]" and were "disproportionate to any causal connexion
which might possibly be found". Further, the "satisfaction"
to Ms Evans of
being in her mother's house for some periods could be far outweighed by "the
disturbance and the upset" of her being
transferred back to hospital.
Nevertheless, and only because the appellant had conceded the point,
his Honour recognised that the
award of damages could reflect provision for
Ms Evans to be transferred from time to time to her mother's
different approach was taken by Gibbs and Stephen JJ. Gibbs and
Stephen JJ had "no doubt" that Ms Evans was entitled to compensation
for the cost of "outings" to her mother's house. However, their Honours
reduced the amount in the range awarded by the trial judge
of $150,000 to
$175,000 to a more particularised amount of $148,000, comprised of $128,000 for
hospital and related expenses and
a further $20,000 for nursing care and
transport for "occasional day visits to her [mother's] home and ... other
outings [from hospital],
possibly even ... occasional weekends away from

of Ms Evans living with her mother full-time. Their
Honours estimated
the present value of that cost as $390,000 based on a life expectancy of 20
As Gibbs and
Stephen JJ reiterated, the evidence suggested that Ms Evans "would be
somewhat more at risk physically at home than
in hospital" and there was no
evidence suggesting any likely psychiatric benefits of living at her mother's
It was in that
context that Gibbs and Stephen JJ remarked that the "touchstone of
reasonableness" involved considering the "cost
matched against health benefits
to the plaintiff", where it is clearly unreasonable to incur a great cost with
slight or speculative
health benefits, particularly if there is a relatively
inexpensive alternative offering equal or slightly lesser benefits.
"The present case ... is a case of alternatives in which the difference in
relative costs is great whereas the benefit to the plaintiff
of the more
expensive alternative is entirely one of amenity, in no way involving physical
or mental well-being."
and Murphy J dissented. Jacobs J agreed with the analysis of Gibbs and
Stephen JJ about the approach to take to an assessment
of damages but would
not have altered the trial judge's assessment of a range of $150,000 to $175,000
for hospital and nursing care,
including the cost of spending periods at home.
His Honour thought that "nothing less than the top of this range was
appropriate".
Murphy J thought that it was not unreasonable for damages to include
part-time care at home and considered that the range of $150,000
to $175,000 was
"quite inadequate".
The rationale for and reception of
Sharman v Evans
The decision of the majority in
Sharman v Evans
that it was
unreasonable for Ms Evans to choose to live at home with her mother
full-time, turned upon the use of unreasonableness
in the first sense described
above. Reasonableness was used as a limit upon compensation which requires that
steps taken, or proposed,
by a plaintiff be steps that are reasonably required
to repair the consequences of the tort. As Gibbs and Stephen JJ expressed
point: "The question here is not what are the ideal requirements but what
are the reasonable requirements of [Ms
Gibbs and Stephen JJ, Ms Evans' choice to live full-time with her
mother was not something that was reasonably required as a
step in attempting to
restore her to the position prior to the tort. Their reasoning depended upon the
increased risk to the health
of Ms Evans with no evidence of any likely
psychiatric benefits. When their Honours spoke of the more expensive choice
at home full-time being "entirely one of amenity", they were using the
term "amenity" in a narrow sense. Amenity in this narrow sense
connotes merely
the ability to do something, in contradistinction with anything that improves
"physical or mental
well-being".
their Honours allowed $20,000 for the purpose only of the enhanced mental
well-being arising from visits to Ms Evans' mother's
the reasonableness limit applied by Gibbs and Stephen JJ is understood as
concerning whether Ms Evans' choice to live full-time
with her mother was a
reasonable choice to repair the consequences to her of the tort, the outcome in
Sharman v Evans
should be seen as concerning no "more than propositions
of fact which were relevant to the case in
may be that, in 2025, where a plaintiff's choice is between nursing care at home
or in a home setting or in an institution or
an institutional setting there will
be few cases where there is any substantial increase in risk to the plaintiff's
health from living
full-time at home with home care. Further, as Basten JA
rightly said in
commonly accepted nowadays that significant benefits will flow to a person from
modifications which would allow him or her
to live at home, rather than in an
institution". In other words, the exercise of a person's autonomy of choice will
usually be associated
with mental well-being. That view has been reflected in
decisions such as
Government Insurance Office of NSW v
in which the
New South Wales Court of Appeal rejected an argument that the cost of home care
could not be included in an award of
compensation where maintenance of the
plaintiff in her home environment was "vital to her well-being and whatever
prospects of improvement
she might have".
the other hand, contrary to this reasoning, some intermediate appellate court
decisions following
Sharman v Evans
have treated the decision of Gibbs
and Stephen JJ as requiring a balancing by the court, independently of the
choice by the plaintiff,
of the health benefits to a plaintiff against the
financial cost. In such cases, it has been held that a high cost of provision of
care at home would not usually be justified in the absence of "particular and
special needs".
also been said that the "fundamental area of reasonableness" contrasts with "the
principle of restitutio in integrum" and
involves asking "what was reasonable
compensation being at all times fair to the
tortfeasor".
essentially the approach of the trial judge and of the Court of Appeal in this
case. This approach is not correct.
The reasonableness of Mr
Stewart's choice of care at home
Reasonableness of a choice to be cared for at home
proper approach to the assessment of the reasonableness of a person's choice to
be cared for at home or in a home setting, rather
than in an institution or an
institutional setting, starts from the premise that the plaintiff is entitled to
compensation in a sum
which, so far as money can do, will put them in the same
position as they would have been in had the defendant not acted negligently.
a case such as this, that proper approach requires an assessment of whether the
choice to incur the expense of care at home is
a reasonable response to repair
the consequences of the tort. In assessing the reasonableness of that choice,
all the circumstances
should be considered and compared with those circumstances
that existed prior to the tort. The assessment of reasonableness is not
to balancing only the health benefits against the cost. The assessment of
reasonableness will be significantly affected
by what is ordinary in those
circumstances. The same is true for the question of whether it was unreasonable
for a person not to
take alternative action which could have mitigated the
a person lived in their own home or in a home setting prior to the tort, and the
restoration of that position, or a similar
position, will be beneficial or at
least not worsen their physical or mental health, it would be unusual to find
that the choice
by that person to receive treatment at home or in a home setting
is unreasonable. Of course, there will be cases where living at
of institutions might be as unpleasant
as being permanently in a prison, while
to another the same institution might be the most desirable of safe
Lord Burrows has observed, "private treatment may offer advantages which
are more than merely medical in nature (eg speed
and comfort) and it is hard to
see how it can ever be unreasonable for a claimant to opt for
the context of a choice to be cared for at home or in a home setting, overseas
courts have also adopted the approach to reasonableness
which focuses upon the
choice of the injured plaintiff as a means to restore their position rather than
an approach which simply
balances the health benefits of the expenditure against
the cost of the expenditure. In giving the judgment of the Supreme Court
Thornton v Board of School Trustees of School District No 57
(Prince George)
Dickson J said that "[t]he current enlightened concept is to dignify and
accept the gravely injured person as a continuing, useful
member of the human
race". In the judgment of the Supreme Court in another case, decided on the same
day, Dickson J said of a man
rendered quadriplegic by the negligence of the
defendant that it was "difficult to conceive of any reasonably-minded person of
means who would not be ready to incur the expense of home care, rather
than institutional care".
in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, O'Connor LJ referred to the
position of the plaintiff prior to the tort as
the "starting point" for an
assessment of the reasonableness of the plaintiff's
Stephenson LJ referred to "the principle that the defendant is answerable
for what is reasonable human conduct and if [the plaintiff's]
reasonable [the defendant] is no less answerable for it if [the defendant] is
able to point to cheaper treatment which
reasonable".
reasoning was later applied by the Court of Appeal in
Pill LJ emphasised that the test to be applied did not ask what was in the
"best interests" of the plaintiff because "paternalism
does not replace the
right of a claimant, or those with responsibility for the claimant, making a
reasonable choice".
The reasonableness of Mr Stewart's choice
the reasons explained above, the approach to reasonableness taken by the trial
judge and the Court of Appeal, which reflected
the approach adopted by some of
the authorities decided after
was in error.
The inquiry should have started from the premise that Mr Stewart was
entitled to compensation in a sum which, as far
as money can do, would put him
in the same position as he would have been in had MNHHS not acted negligently.
The inquiry should
not have been reduced to a simple balancing of the costs to
MNHHS and the health benefits to Mr Stewart of care at (a rented) home.
this case, the question was whether his choice to be cared for at home was a
reasonable response to repair the consequences of
the tort by MNHHS.
addressing that question, this assessment of Mr Stewart's choice of home
care is that prior to the negligence by MNHHS, Mr Stewart
lived in a home
with his brother where Jesse and his dog would visit regularly. The option of
living with care at Ozanam did not
restore, and would not have restored, that
position because of the restrictions on Jesse or a dog staying at Ozanam. It can
be accepted
that, as MNHHS submitted in this Court, care in a rented home
without Mr Stewart's brother would not precisely restore Mr Stewart's
prior position. But the fact that a precise level of correspondence cannot be
achieved is beside the point. For Mr Stewart to be
cared for in a rented
his circumstances at the time
of trial of living at Ozanam.
reasonableness of Mr Stewart's choice of home care is reinforced by the
conclusions of the trial judge about the effect of living
Mr Stewart's physical and mental health. Mr Stewart's quality of life
and mental health would be enhanced by receiving
care at home rather than at
Ozanam and the real physical health benefits were, as the trial judge
not slight or
speculative. Further, whatever might have been the position in 1977 when
Sharman v Evans
was decided, a choice by a severely injured plaintiff to
receive care at home is, today, one that is not unusual, especially given
improvement in levels of care that can be provided at home or in a home setting.
effect of the conclusion that Mr Stewart acted reasonably in seeking to
restore his position to that prior to the tort by his
choice to live in a rented
rates is that the onus
then fell upon MNHHS to establish that part or all of
that claimed cost of home care could be avoided by an alternative that was
unreasonably refused. MNHHS attempted to discharge that onus by suggesting the
second option, which was much cheaper (staying at
Ozanam with enhanced care from
an external care assistant and the provision of more frequent therapy and
failed to discharge its onus of establishing that Mr Stewart acted
unreasonably in refusing the second option despite that
option being much
cheaper. Although it was possible that Mr Stewart might be equally
motivated under the second care option at Ozanam
to achieve physical health
improvements that were not significantly worse than those that could be achieved
at home, MNHHS did not
establish any likelihood that the external care assistant
would develop the necessary rapport required to motivate Mr Stewart. In
other words, unlike the improvement in his physical health that would likely
result from Mr Stewart's care at home, MNHHS did not
establish the extent
of any likelihood that the second option would improve Mr Stewart's
physical health when compared with his then
present arrangements at Ozanam. The
better quality of life and the mental health improvements that would also result
from Mr Stewart
living in his own (rented) home, and the ordinary nature of
such arrangements for a person in Mr Stewart's position, reinforce the
of unreasonableness in Mr Stewart declining the second option despite the
substantially lower cost of that option.
The effect of damages
for care at home on general damages
Sharman v Evans
, Gibbs and Stephen JJ performed the exercise of
quantification of the damages payable to Ms Evans by considering nursing
and medical
expenses before general damages since the extent to which
Ms Evans would be required to be in hospital would affect the size of her
general damages: "a lifetime substantially spent in hospital will greatly
aggravate" her loss of amenities and enjoyment of
That approach
properly reduces the possibility of double counting in the assessment of
Queensland, general damages for personal injury are assessed in accordance with
Civil Liability Act 2003
(Qld). In order to
determine the level of general damages under those provisions, the court is
required to follow the rules outlined
of Sch 3 of the
Liability Regulation 2014
(Qld) and to assign an injury scale value based on
the ranges for particular injuries set out in Sch 4 of the
Liability Regulation
. The trial judge found that Mr Stewart's injury
fell within item 5.1 of Sch 4 ("Extreme brain injury –
Substantial insight
remaining") with a range of injury scale values between 71
and 100, from which the trial judge assigned a value of
assessing the injury scale value for a particular injury, a court may have
regard to "other matters", to the extent that they
are relevant in any given
case, including "pain, suffering and loss of amenities of
In this case,
however, the reasons of the trial judge concerning general damages were
exclusively functional and did not make any
adjustment within the range for any
lack of mental well-being of Mr Stewart at Ozanam. It was not suggested by
either party that
this assessment was not undertaken in accordance with the
statutory regime. However, the fact that general damages were assessed
manner provides context for how the compensatory principle is to be applied in
relation to Mr Stewart's claim for cost of
care. There was therefore no
dispute between the parties that the total quantum of damages assessed "on the
basis that the appellant
would reside in his own residence" should be
$5,883,688.85 (before management fees), which included, amongst other things,
$4,753,241.47
for the costs of future care in a rented home, and $284,700 as
general damages, which was the same amount awarded by the trial judge.
the quantum of the relevant heads of damages which should follow this appeal

Stewart sought, without
opposition from MNHHS, orders that the matter be remitted to the trial judge to
