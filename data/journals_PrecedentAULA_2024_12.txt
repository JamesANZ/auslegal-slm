20 YEARS OF
Shaun Marcus
This year we will celebrate 20 years of
, a critical
publication of the ALA that underpins our organisation in many ways. It provides
high-level content to our members at
first instance but also plays a number of
other important roles.
As part of our recent survey, it was clear that our members highly value the
resource, with 64% of respondents stating that they have
in the last 12 months. As well as being a
resource for our members,
contributes to the
revenue we receive. We also have data that
is a valuable
resource on Austlii with wide readership, which promotes our organisation to the
legal community outside of our members.
I would argue
plays a significant role in establishing
the ALA’s legitimacy for the areas in which we advocate.
The format of
has remained largely
unchanged for two decades. Given that this is its 20th year, I believe it
is a good time to reflect on the publication
and consider what, if any,
improvements we can make. I would be grateful to hear from or talk to any
members with ideas or suggestions.
Some of the areas I think we could consider are:
• Whether the publication need only be available to members for the
first 18 months. If it were more widely available, would
o attract more writers (particularly given the digital age we live in);
o give the organisation more relevance as current material would be available
to a wider audience; and
o increase potential marketing opportunities?
• Reviewing the current layout and structure
NATIONAL UPDATE
I thought I would take this opportunity to provide a brief update on the work
of the ALA from our national office.
One of our significant projects is seeking legislative reform of compensation
recovery laws to improve outcomes for vulnerable people
across Australia,
particularly those who have been waiting for months to have Services Australia
process their claims, causing distress
and financial hardship. We have had
ongoing engagement with Services Australia and federal government, seeking
reforms to the current
framework, and are quietly optimistic that our message is
getting through.
Further policy work is being driven by longtime active NSW member, Dr Andrew
Morrison RFD SC, seeking a unified approach to permanent
stays across the nation
and emphasising the need for law reform in this space.
The ALA only works because so many people give generously of their time and
expertise. The ALA works because – despite being
in a competitive market
for new work and clients – we gel together to protect the rights of
individuals against challenges
and attacks, including those from different
governments around Australia.
For example, the Victorian Parliament has just passed laws to effectively
eradicate 80% or more of mental-health-related claims. In
Victoria’s long-tail workers’ compensation scheme will be reduced by
at least 85% due to the cost-saving reforms
introduced. Despite extensive
advocacy by unions and the ALA, the
Workplace Injury Rehabilitation and
Compensation Amendment (WorkCover Scheme Modernisation) Act 2023
commence on Sunday 31 March 2024.
In another example, the WA Government recently introduced the
Legislation Amendment (Motor Vehicle Claims Harvesting) Bill 2023
. If passed,
the law will force claimants to meet with the insurer, within six months of
notifying the insurer of their intention
to claim, to make a pre-litigation
offer to settle their action at a time when many injuries are not yet stable.
Both of these proposals
have been designed by Labor governments.
These aren’t merely local state issues. For example, I have no doubt
that other governments will be interested in the reforms
that have just passed
in Victoria.
The ALA, as a collective, is well placed to take up these battles to allow
individuals the right to high quality legal representation
without significant
barriers to compensation following an injury.
On a policy level, the ALA has never been more relevant. We are regularly
acknowledged as industry leaders and experts on significant
policy issues
affecting individuals and that is something we should all be proud of.
