the Applicant/s
applied for the consent of the Respondent, Whitehorse City Council, (
) to a building permit application for a proposed design in respect
of a dwelling to be erected/built at 15 Shafer Road, Blackburn
Subject Land
Applicants’ report and consent application sought the Council’s
approval for the proposed dwelling to have a setback
distance of 6.619 metres
from the front street alignment, instead of the prescribed minimum setback
distance of 9.0 metres, as required
under reg 74 of the
Building Regulations
the Regulations
regulation 74
of the Regulations:
The report and consent of the
relevant council must be obtained to an application for a building permit in
relation to a design that
does not comply with this regulation.
28 March 2025 the Council refused consent, reasoning
Refusal Reasons.
Council officers have assessed your application, undertaken a site inspection
and in this instance, are not willing to support the
proposed minimum street
setback, as the proposal is not in-line with the Minister’s Guidelines
Council has utilised the Ministers Guidelines to conduct this assessment and
the following determinations are provided:
a.– Not applicable
b. the setback will result in a disruption to the streetscape in this
instance, as the nearby buildings are all setback more than
6.619metres from the
front boundary; and;
c. the setback is not consistent with any relevant neighbourhood character
objective, policy or statement set out in the relevant
planning scheme; and The
City of Whitehorse’s Housing & Neighbourhood Character Review (Garden
Suburban Precinct 9) contains
the following preferred neighbourhood character
“To maintain and reinforce the rhythm of spacing between and around
buildings, and the alignment of buildings along the street”
At least one of the following criteria apply:
d. the setback will not be more appropriate taking into account the
prevailing setback within Shafer Road being generally in excess
6.619metres.
e. the setback will not be more appropriate taking into account the preferred
character of the area, where it has been identified
in the relevant planning
f. the siting of the building is not constrained by the shape and or
dimensions of the allotment; or
g. the siting of the building is not constrained by the slope of the
allotment or other conditions on the allotment; or
h. there is not a need to decrease the setback to maximise solar access to
habitable room windows and or private open space; or
i. the setback will not be more appropriate taking into account the desire or
need to retain vegetation on the allotment.
21 April 2025, the Applicant/s appealed the Council’s decision (
s 144(1)(a)
Building Act 1993
) to the Building Appeals Board (
Appeal was heard ‘on the papers’ on 19 June
have considered the parties’ written submissions and the material filed
with the BAB. We have also had regard to the applicable
Decision Guidelines set
out under the Minister’s Guideline MG-12, given it is a relevant
consideration for the BAB to consider.
Based on these considerations we make
the following findings.
Subject Land is located within a neighbourhood that is undergoing transition.
The existing housing stock of single storey, bream
brick 1950’s and
1960’s dwellings are incrementally being replaced by larger double storey
‘volume build’
dwellings or medium density housing proposals. In
each of those circumstances, there has been an increase in site coverage, hard
surfaces and a decrease in setbacks, as well as the landscaping theme becoming
more formalised.
Subject Land is located on a corner, determining that it has only one neighbour
as reference point when deciding whether the proposed
front setback is an
acceptable outcome.
Subject Land is also not as ‘deep’ as other sites on both sides of
the street. With a depth of 30 metres, it is roughly
‘shorter’ than its neighbour and up to 4 metres shorter than other
sites within the street.
the Subject Land is largely devoid of vegetation, the neighbour to the west has
a large hedge that runs along the common side
boundary and the dwelling itself
at No.13 Shafer Street, has a significant side setback in the vicinity of 2.4m.
There also does
not appear to be any habitable room windows facing the Subject
to the planning scheme, the site is a General Residential Zone, which includes
the purposes;
To encourage
development that is responsive to the neighbourhood character of the area.
To encourage a
diversity of housing types and housing growth particularly in locations offering
good access to services and transport.
schedule to the Zone, makes the following modification;
Any new wall on
a boundary should be setback at least 10 metres from the front boundary or 1
metre further than the average set back
of the buildings on adjoining
allotments, whichever is the lesser.
mentioned by the council the Subject Land also falls into the Garden suburban
Precinct 9 Neighbourhood character area, which includes
the following
strategies;
Site low-set,
pitched-roof development in spacious garden settings, with a backdrop of large
native and exotic trees.
Maintain the
pattern of regular front and side setbacks from both side boundaries, allowing
sufficient space for planting and growth
of new vegetation.
Set back upper
levels of new development from the ground level to minimise their dominance in
the streetscape.
Provide low or
open style front fences, that allow views into front gardens and lawn areas and
maintain an open streetscape.
regard to the existing conditions and the planning context, it is clear that the
thrust of the neighbourhood character provisions
is to provide for dwellings to
existing in a landscaped setting. This includes, not only the front setbacks,
but also the side setbacks
and to provide a backdrop of vegetation, presumably
enhanced by planting in the rear setback.
proposal before us, provides for a 6.619 metre front setback, approximately 2.7m
setback to both side boundaries and a 3m setback
to the rear boundary. The
proposed dwelling is centrally located on the Subject Land, with setbacks that
provide sufficient space
for the planting of canopy trees.
into account the strategic thrust of the scheme for a neighbourhood where
dwellings are ‘framed’ by vegetation,
and in recognition that this
site is different from its neighbours by having a ‘short’ depth, it
is our view, that the
proposed front setbacks is an acceptable
DETERMINATION DATED: 30 June 2025
Clause 17 of Schedule 3 to the
Building Act 1993
provides: ‘Unless the Building Appeals Board
otherwise determines, a party to a proceeding before the Board must bear his,
or its own costs’.
