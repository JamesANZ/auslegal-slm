DR DAMIEN CREMEAN
DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON
DOMESTIC BUILDING TRIBUNAL
REASONS FOR DETERMINATION
1. On 29 May 1997 this proceeding and related proceedings were set down for
hearing on 6 August 1997 on the preliminary issues of
(a) the parties between whom a contract (if any) was made;
(b) if a contract was made, the nature of the subject-matter of such
2. At the hearing on 6 August (from which the Fund was excused) I heard
evidence from Mr Kulyk and Ms Cefai and also from Mr Gibcus
Mr Luke. As well I also heard evidence from: Mr R. Werden,
Mr Santin and Mr Laferla. Mr Gibcus is employed by the City of
Maribyrnong.
Mr Luke is a sub-agent. Mr R. Werden (a financial
planner) and Mr Santin (a builder) are employees and directors of JGR
Pty Ltd. Mr Laferlo is an electrical contractor. Mr Kulyk
is a draftsperson while Ms Cefai is a bank teller.
3. The preliminary issue concerns premises at Unit 1/36 Middle Road,
Maribyrnong. The is no doubt that Mr Kulyk and Ms Cefai purchased
these premises on 23 April 1996 from JGR Properties Pty Ltd. Exhibit "A5" is
the Contract Note. Another exhibit "A6" which is a
list of points or questions
relating to iteMs of construction or completion which was signed by the
parties at or before or after
the signing of the Contract Note.
4. The argument on behalf of J.G.R. Properties Pty Ltd, which appears to be a
developer, is that Mr Kulyk (and presumably Ms Cefai
purchaser) became an owner/builder of the premises that were purchased. It was
submitted that I should find so on the evidence,
in particular, of
Mr R. Wenden, Mr Santin and Mr Laferla. The principal
factor said to be in support of such submission was the
alleged active
involvement of Mr Kulyk in and about the construction or completion of the
dwelling. It was said to follow from this
that on, or on a date after, 23 April
1996, Mr Kulyk (and, as I say, presumably Ms Cefai) became not only
owner of the premises but
builder as well. A definition of "owner builder" to
which I was referred (by Mr Settle) is in
House Contracts
Guarantee Act
. That defines "owner builder" as a person who otherwise
than in the course of carrying on a business of constructing dwelling
(a) Constructs a dwelling - house that is intended to be used as a residence
(whether or not as a principal place of residence) by-
(i) that person; or
(ii) in the case of a corporation, one or more directors of that corporation;
(b) constructs two dwelling-houses on a two lot sub-division if-
(i) that person resides or intends; or
(ii) in the case of a corporation, one or more directors of that corporation
resides or intends or intend-
to reside in one of the dwelling-houses.
5. I have considered the evidence in the case, given by all the witnesses,
very carefully. I have considered, also very carefully,
the various submissions
made by or on behalf of the parties. Having done so, I am quite satisfied that
I should reject the argument
advanced on behalf of J.G.R. Properties Pty Ltd. I
find, for the reasons I give, that neither Mr Kulyk nor Ms Cefai
became an owner
builder but that they did become owners. So far as I need to do
so, I find, for the reasons I give, that J.G.R. Properties Pty Ltd
remained the builder at all material times after the acquisition date.
6. For the purpose of such findings I accept the evidence of Mr Kulyk.
He said that the question of him being an owner builder was
not raised at any
time with him before mediation. When the Contract Note was signed, there was
never any mention of it. The Contract
Note contains no reference to it.
Exhibit A6 is, I accept, merely a list of iteMs he wanted attended to. It
would seem extreme
that he (and Ms Cefai) would pay $160,000 for a unit
only to become owner builder. I accept the evidence of Mr Luke, an
experienced
agent, that $160,000 would be a fair price for a completed unit in
the area. He also is the agent who was present at the signing
of the Contract
Note and it was his evidence that there was no discussion at that time about
Mr Kulyk being owner builder. Mr Kulyk’s
evidence is very
plainly supported by Ms Cefai. To an extent, it is supported also, by way
of negative inference, by that of Mr
Gibcus based on the Council file in
the matter.
7. At the same time I accept, as I must, that Mr Kulyk did have an
something of an active involvement in things happening on site
after the date of
purchase. Mention was made, in particular, of the carport, the kitchen,
carpets, tiling, painting, and parquetry.
But I reject the submission that, by
reason of his involvement, he, in effect, became also the builder. I find that
his involvement
was not nearly so great as to warrant that inference being
drawn. Moreover, it was not made clear to me how the drawing of such
inference is open at law. No authorities were cited to me but I do not say that
the inference is one which is not open at law.
In any event, I accept that his
involvement, to a degree not clear upon the evidence, was occasioned by
frustration born of delays
or inactivity.
8. Having formed the view, as I do, that I accept the evidence of
Mr Kulyk, it follows that I reject the evidence given by or on behalf
J.G.R. Properties Pty Ltd to the extent to which it is at variance. In
particular I make mention or Mr R. Werden and Mr Santin.
the evidence of the former about what happened on site I disregard because, as
he himself said, he was not present on site
very much. The evidence of the
latter (Mr Santin) I found confusing and unclear. He could not tell me, in
a straight forward way,
who the builder was, in his view, after 23 April 1996.
He said he "would say" that at that date the roof on the dwelling was complete:
Mr Kulyk was quite definite on this that the tiling on the roof was only
me to accept
that Mr Kulyk had refused to sign a written contract relating to the
premises but that he (Mr Santin ) had remained
silent about this, and had
not told his co-directors in JGR Properties Pty Ltd about it, until only some 3
or 4 weeks before. I
do not recall any such thing being put to Mr Kulyk in
cross-examination but, even if it was, I would find it very surprising indeed
that such an important matter would be kept hidden from view for a year or so.
I reject the evidence accordingly.
9. It seeMs to me that, on and from 23 April 1996, if not before, the
builder of the dwelling was JGR Properties Pty Ltd. I accept
that this was so
based on the evidence of Mr Kulyk and Ms Cefai and based upon the
contents of Exhibits A5 and A6. In particular
I reject the evidence of
Mr Santin, that from that date, JGR Properties Pty Ltd had nothing to do
with the project. Mr Santin in
his evidence appeared to fail to appreciate
that although he was a registered builder (from 1995 or so) he was also a
director of
that company. I am entirely unconvinced that after 23 April 1996,
as if something miraculously happened on that date, the project
went ahead with
him personally and not with JGR Properties Pty Ltd as the builder. There is no
evidence of any such thing happening.
I would make the observation also that
proceeding D337/97 can only be sustained as being within the authority of the
Tribunal under
s54 of the 1995 Act if I regard the Applicant (JGR Properties Pty
Ltd) as a builder. But, in view of my findings, this is not something
need to take into account on the question.
10. In line with the submission of Mr Settle, I find as follows: as
regards the building of the premises, the building contract was
made between JGR
Properties Pty Ltd and Mr Kulyk and Ms Cefai: the subject matter of
such contract was the completion of the building
work by JGR Properties Pty Ltd
as the builder.
11. Having found as I have, this matter and related matters must be returned
to Case Management Conference on a convenient date.
The costs of Mr Kulyk
and Ms Cefai are reserved pending the outcome of the proceedings it being
noted that they have been successful
on the preliminary issues.
