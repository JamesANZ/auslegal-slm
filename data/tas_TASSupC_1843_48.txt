Pickering was charged with having stolen, on the 21st September last, a gun, wearing apparel &c., in a hut belonging
to Mr. William Russell.
William Francis deposed that himself and another man were servants of Mr. Russell, and occupied one of the huts at that
gentleman's station. They had been out most of the day, hunting for opossums, witness having a gun. On returning, about dusk
in the evening, two strange men were in the hut; one of them stepped out, and ordered them to stand. They took the gun from him,
which was then unloaded, tied their hands, and baled them up. The prisoner at the bar was one of the men who stepped out of the hut.
It was dusk; there was a fire in the hut; and he could swear to the prisoner being one of the men. Four days before, the prisoner,
another man, and a woman, stopped at the hut all night, representing themselves to be free people, looking for work. While witness
was in the bedroom they went to the next place, and fetched a man named Charles Steward. They took from the hut belonging to witness
a blue jacket and waistcoat, and a paid of moleskin trowsers. Witness got his hands untied, and loosed those of Thomas Blissney.
Made a spring and got the prisoner down, who was standing outside the door; they both fell. While on the ground, the other man took
a gun from the bed-room, and gave him a blow on the head with the butt end of it. The witness then said - I got hold of the gun but
the man wrenched it from me; the man ordered me to go on my knees, and swore he would blow a hole through my body. The gun was pointed
towards me, and cocked. I had seen the man load it. I did not hear the prisoner say a word while these proceedings were going on.
The other man who had been tied begged him not to shoot me. The other man loaded the gun taken from me in my presence. I afterwards
saw it broken and thrown into the river. I saw some clothing belonging to a fellow servant also taken out of the hut. The other man
told the prisoner if he did not mind what he was about he would shoot him; he must not suffer the men to rush him again.
By the Judge. - The gun was taken from me in the hut; I had it in my hand; I did not part with it willingly.
John Sims went to the hut of the last witness, on the 21st September last. He was tied, and two men were there; one of
them was the prisoner at the bar; he had a gun in his hand. I saw Steward there; the prisoner and the other man tied him. Francis
rushed the prisoner, and the other thief said to the prisoner if he allowed himself to be rushed again, he would shoot him. The other
man told the prisoner to shoot the first who stirred. They took a bundle with them containing clothes.
By the Judge. - I know the prisoner was one of the men; there was a fire and a lighted candle in the hut. The men were
there three hours; the candle was lighted half an hour. The prisoner stood on the threshold of the door, with the gun pointed inside.
Thomas Lister. - On the night in question had been to the overseer's hut for some flour. On returning, the prisoner
ordered him into the hut, where another man tied his hands. They then went to another hut, about 100 yards off, belonging to Mr.
Russell, and fetched Charles Steward, whose hands they also tied; saw Francis rush the prisoner; did not see them on the ground;
did not see the prisoner strike Francis; the other man told Francis to go on his knees, and he would blow a hole through him. Myself,
Charles Steward, and John Sims, begged him not to shoot Francis; they took away a bag of clothes; the prisoner had Francis's
gun, with which he had been "opossuming"; I saw the prisoner load it with both powder and lead; the gun was broken in the
struggle; the prisoner took it away and it was afterwards thrown into the river, where it was found; had seen the prisoner, the other
man, and a woman, on the previous Sunday night.
The Chief Justice, in summing up, laid down the law, and remarked upon the circumstance that the prosecutor could not
say whether the prisoner at the bar, or the other man, took the gun from him.
The Jury found the prisoner Guilty.

William Pickering
, convicted of house-breaking, and putting the prosecutor in bodily fear, (as reported in our last number), was sentenced to death,
with an intimation that the learned judge would recommend the government to spare his life, as he had not taken so active a part
in the felony as the other man who was with him.
According to AOTSC 41/5 Pickering was sentenced to be hanged, but this was commuted to transportation for life beyond
the seas. See also AOT CSO 20/16, pp. 281-89 for the Judge's Report.
