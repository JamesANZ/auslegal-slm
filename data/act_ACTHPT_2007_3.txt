The Tribunal
is a very intelligent and experienced medical practitioner who has the
misfortune to suffer from neurological and psychiatric
conditions that
have the potential to significantly impact upon her life in general and,
more particularly, her career.
In 2004 X ceased work, and at her request
her name was removed from the register of medical practitioners, due to
severe depression. She now wishes to return to the practice of
medicine and, to that end, she applied to the Medical Board
of the ACT for
registration as a medical practitioner under the
Health Professionals
(ACT) (�the Act�). In April 2007 the Board resolved not to
re-register X.
The object of the Act in requiring registration
of medical practitioners
is to protect the public. One of the ways in which the Act and Regulations
seeks to protect
the public in the process of registration of medical
practitioners is by ensuring that applicants for registration are
physically and mentally healthy enough to practise medicine.
is common ground between the Board and X that the effect of the provisions
of the Act and the
Health Professionals Regulation 2004
is that the Board was
required to be satisfied that X was mentally and physically healthy enough
to practice as a medical
practitioner. On 13 April this year the Board
determined not to re-register X on the grounds that it was not so
X now seeks a review of that decision.
behalf of the Board, Dr Boss raised interesting questions concerning the
nature of the review to be undertaken by this
Tribunal. In the
circumstances of this case it is unnecessary to resolve the issues raised
by Dr Boss. The Act makes
it clear that this Tribunal is entitled to
receive, and act upon, evidence before it which may not have been before
Board. There was a considerable amount of material, particularly by
way of specialist medical reports, before this Tribunal
that was not before
the Board. Section 62A(2) of the Act enjoins this Tribunal to exercise the
functions of the Board
in deciding whether to re-register X as if the
original decision to refuse re-registration had not been made. In the
circumstances of this case it is not necessary to determine what might be
the appropriate form of �review� of the Board�s decision
if the Tribunal
were called upon to make such a review based solely on the evidence that
had been before the Board.
Board relied upon the following reports:
report of Tom Sutton, psychologist, dated 25 November 2005;
report of Dr Lev Fridgant, psychiatrist, dated 13 July 2006;
report of Dr Pavan Bhandari dated 15 February 2007.
relied on the following written material:
a report from Dr Gytis Danta, neurologist, dated 24 September
an undated 2 page statement by X;
a report from Dr Rodney Morice, psychiatrist, dated 24 August
a supplementary report from Dr Morice dated 18 September 2007;
a number of personal testimonials attesting to X�s good
scant reference to the testimonials produced on behalf of X does not
indicate a dismissive attitude by the Tribunal
to this material, but
merely reflects the fact that X�s character is unchallenged by the Board,
and the only issue in
this case is her physical and mental fitness to
practise medicine.
addition to receiving the above written material, the Tribunal also heard
oral evidence from X and from her proposed
mentor, Dr R. We do not propose
setting out in detail the contents of the written reports or the oral
evidence put before
us. It is fair to say that little, if any, dispute
surrounded the factual matters. The issue is, what orders are appropriate
in the light of the evidence?
the material before it, the Tribunal is satisfied that X is presently
mentally and physically healthy enough to practice
medicine and that she
should be re-registered as a medical practitioner, subject to certain
conditions being met. There
are two broad areas of concern regarding X�s
health, her neurological condition and her psychiatric condition. With
to the former, Dr Danta, in his recent report of 24 September this
year, does not consider that X�s neurological condition
precludes her from
practising medicine, an opinion with which this Tribunal agrees.
noting the Board�s legitimate concerns surrounding a suicide attempt by X
in May this year, this Tribunal agrees
with the assessment of her current
treating psychiatrist Dr Morice that
X�s mental health is presently such that she can practise medicine.
We note that the suicide attempt in May this year coincided
decision of the Board not to re-register X, a decision that she found
personally distressing. Since that time
she has established and maintained
a treatment relationship with Dr Morice and has commenced treatment with
olanzapine,
a drug with a recognised mood stabilising and antidepressant
properties. We accept that X has insight into her condition which
augmented by the ability and willingness of her colleagues and family to
assist in monitoring her condition. It is
also a significant factor in
determining that X is mentally healthy enough to practise as a medical
practitioner that,
despite her illness being longstanding, there is no
suggestion that she has ever inappropriately treated a patient or put a
patient at risk. The evidence in fact suggests that she is professionally
well regarded.
are satisfied that X�s re-registration and return to practice should be
subject to conditions. So much was accepted
by Mr Pike who represented X.
Despite the fact that X has voluntarily maintained her professional
knowledge by attending
appropriate seminars we consider it prudent that
she attend continuing medical education (CME) events, such as have been
approved for maintaining vocational registration by the Royal Australasian
College of General Practitioners.
addition, we consider the following conditions should be placed on her
registration:
that she only work in a group general practice as approved in
writing by the Medical Board;
that she work no more than 15 hours per week;
that she accept all reasonable direction of Dr R, or some
other medical practitioner nominated in writing by the Medical Board, on
matters concerning her practice of medicine;
that she attend for treatment a general practitioner approved
in writing by the Medical Board at a frequency to be determined by
that medical
practitioner;
that she attend a mentor independent of her employment as
nominated by the Board, at such intervals as determined by the Board, and
she authorise her mentor to report to the Board at intervals determined by the
Board. The need for this mentor to continue
is to be revised by the Board every
that she attend for treatment a psychiatrist approved in
writing by the Medical Board at a frequency to be determined by the treating
psychiatrist;
that she authorise her general practitioner and psychiatrist
to report to the Medical Board any failure to attend for treatment,
termination of treatment or if there is any significant change in her health
that she authorise Dr R or such other medical practitioner who
has been approved in writing by the Medical Board to provide the Board
information as requested by the Board;
that she not work between 6pm and 8am;
that she provide a copy of these conditions to her employer
and Dr R, or such other medical practitioner nominated in writing by
Medical Board; and
that she authorise her employer and Dr R, or such other
medical practitioner nominated by the Medical Board, to notify the Board
there are any concerns regarding her illness impacting on her medical practice.
