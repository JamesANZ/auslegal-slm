Introduction
[1] On 11 and 12
September 2025, I heard two interlocutory applications in this proceeding. On 15
September 2025, I published my reasons
and directed that the parties submit a
draft order that reflects both the agreed directions (as the parties had agreed
to some issues)
and the decisions recorded in the
[2] The parties
have been unable to agree on a draft order that reflects both the agreed
directions, and the decisions recorded in
the reasons. The parties have
submitted competing draft orders. The parties are content for the court to make
its decision ‘on
the papers’ and have supplied written
submissions.
[3] There are
two broad areas of disagreement.
Expert Evidence in Reply
area of disagreement of concerns Brisbane Airport Corporation’s
’) expert evidence in reply. The issue is covered in
paragraphs 36 to 47 in the reasons delivered on 15 September 2025 under
sub-heading ‘Timetabling Dispute
[5] The end
point of that discussion was that I allowed the staggered approach in
Airservices Australia’s (‘
’) proposed orders. As
paragraph 47 makes clear, the intention is that both sides’ evidence is to
be completed by 30 April
[6] For that
reason, orders will be made in accordance with paragraphs 16 and 17 of the
plaintiff’s draft.
The ‘Top-Up’
area of disagreement concerns BAC’s ‘top-up’
evidence. The discussion is in paragraphs 32 to 54 of the reasons
delivered on
15 September 2025 under the sub-heading “The ‘Top-Up’
[8] The evident
intention of that reasoning is that it is necessary for ASA and the court to see
that ‘top-up’ evidence
so that the position and any possible
prejudice can be assessed. The idea is that the ‘top-up’ evidence be
assessed and then the extent of, and timing of, responsive evidence
can be assessed.
[9] For that
reason, orders should be made in accordance with paragraphs 7 to 10 of the
plaintiff’s draft.
[10] The other
aspects covered in the plaintiff’s draft order are not in issue.
