REASONS FOR DECISION – PRINCIPAL
1 Unauthorised parking on common property and improper
2 The Applicant is “The Owners of The Kurrajongs – Strata Plan
Strata Plan and relevant
3 Strata Plan 846 (“the Strata Plan”) was registered on
July 1971 pursuant to the
Strata Titles Act 1966
1966 Act"). In 1985, the 1966 Act was repealed and replaced by the
Titles Act 1985
(“the 1985 Act”) which continues to be the relevant
4 In these Reasons, unless otherwise specified, all references to sections and
Schedules are, respectively, references to sections
of and Schedules to the 1985
5 The parcel comprises 32 residential Lots in an 8-storeyed building. There are
also 3 buildings used as garages plus a large area
of surrounding common
6 The parcel is situated in Mt. Lawley and has frontages to Clifton Crescent,
Rookwood Street and Glenroyd Street.
7 The Strata Plan specifies 7 Clifton Crescent, Mt Lawley, as the address for
service of notices on the Strata Company.
8 The registered proprietors of Lot 28 on the Strata Plan are Terence Leslie
Hurrey, Michael Bruce Sharpe and Bruce Howard Lamb.
10 When the Strata Plan was registered, the by-laws of the Strata Company were,
pursuant to s15 (2) of the 1966 Act, the “standard”
by-laws in Parts
I and II in the Schedule to the 1966 Act.
11 The Strata Plan records, in notification A744595, that in 1973 an additional
Part I, by-law 3(h) was added to allow the Strata
Company to take a lease of one
of the lots for the purpose of accommodating a caretaker.
12 However, Notification G339789, noted on the Strata Plan on 29 November 1996,
records the repeal of Part 1, by-law 3(h).
13 Notification G339789 also records that
‘...the Schedule 1 by-laws contained in Schedule 1 of the Strata
Titles Amendment Act 1995 were adopted”
that a new Sch 1 by-law 16, in the following terms, was added:
“...the Part II by-laws contained in the Schedule to the Strata
Titles Act 1966 were repealed and the Schedule 2 by-laws contained
in Schedule 2
of the Strata Titles Amendment Act 1995 were adopted”
17 Apart from the repeal of Part I, by-law 3(h), the validity of the
Notification may, in some respects, be in doubt because there
were no by-laws in
Sch 1 to the Strata Titles Amendment Act 1995.
18 When the 1985 Act repealed and replaced the 1966 Act, s 42(2) specified
that the by-laws in Sch 1 to the 1985 Act would be deemed
to be the by-laws of
the Strata Company until amended, repealed or added by the relevant strata
19 However, the Strata Titles Amendment Act 1995 amended s42 (2) to provide
that the “standard” by-laws in Schs 1 and
2 to the 1985 Act would be
deemed to be the by-laws of every strata company, until amended, repealed or
added to. Accordingly, even
if Notification G339789 was invalid in some
respects, the by-laws of the Strata Company now comprise the by-laws in Schs 1
The Strata Company may need to seek advice in relation to Sch 1 by-law
16 referred to above.
20 Schedule 1, by-law 1(2) includes:-
“A proprietor, occupier or other resident of a lot shall –
use and enjoy the common property in such a manner as not unreasonably to
interfere with the use and enjoyment thereof by other proprietors,
occupiers or
residents, or of their visitors;
not use the lot or permit it to be used in such manner or for such
purpose as causes a nuisance to any occupier of another lot (whether
proprietor or not) or family of such an occupier;
(c) take all reasonable steps to ensure that his visitors do not
behave in a manner likely to interfere with the peaceful
enjoyment of the
proprietor, occupier or other resident of another lot or any person lawfully
using common property;
take all reasonable steps to ensure that his visitors comply with the
by-laws of the strata company relating to the parking of motor
29 The Sch 2 by-laws include:-
A proprietor, occupier, or other resident of a lot shall not park or
stand any motor or other vehicle upon common property except
with the written
approval of the strata company.
Obstruction of Common Property
A proprietor, occupier, or other resident of a lot shall not obstruct
lawful use of common property by any person.
Behaviour of proprietors and occupiers
A proprietor, occupier, or other resident of a shall not use
language or behave in a manner likely to cause offence or embarassment
proprietor, occupier, or other resident of another lot or to any person lawfully
using common property”.
36 Orders sought
37 The Applicant has sought orders under Section 83 following terms
38 “ 1. That the proprietor or occupier of Lot 28 not park or stand a
motor vehicle upon the common property and in particular
in any area where there
is displayed a no parking sign or to obstruct the common property so as to
prevent lawful and permitted use
of the common property by the local authority,
visitors and other occupiers.
40 2.That the proprietor or occupier of Lot 28 not use language or
behave in a manner likely to cause offence or embarrassment
to any person
lawfully using the common property.
42 3.That the proprietor of Lot 28 take all reasonable steps to ensure that
every occupier complies with the by-laws of the strata
company and particularly
those relating to the parking of motor vehicles, obstruction and
behaviour.”
Applicant's
submissions
43 The Applicant submits that repeated requests have been made to Mr. Michael
Bruce Sharpe, one of the proprietors and occupiers
of Lot 28, to park his
vehicle in Lot 28’s garage, but that he has ignored those requests. The
Applicant has provided a diarised
report and photographs of a vehicle said to
have been parked by Mr. Sharpe in areas marked
“no parking”
and in front of rubbish bins, in a manner which interferes with the collection
of rubbish by the local government.
44 The Applicant reports that
“on several occasions the council has been made aware of aggressive
behaviour and verbal abuse by Mr. Sharpe when asked to move
his vehicle to his
allocated car-bay.”
46 In relation to the third of the orders sought there have been reports of
abusive language against at least one elderly resident.
Submissions in response to
application
47 There has been no response in opposition to this application.
48 The proprietors of 7 lots have supported the application.
49 One elderly resident has reported, in relation to one an unidentified
occupier of Lot 28, that:
“I have had personal contact with the proprietor/occupier of Lot
28, although I have never spoken to him
In the lift going down to the ground floor, he nearly knocked me over as
he pushed by to get out of the lift, using offensive language
as he left.
On another occasion, we met as I got out at the ground level to take my
rubbish to the bin, and again, totally unprovoked, he used
very bad language. I
then walked towards the bin and he followed, going towards the front parking
area. He actually tuned round
to face me, and shouted obscenities before
reaching his vehicle.
53 Another proprietor has reported
“Quite apart from the abusive language used on more than one
occasion, the important issue is the parking in front of large
bins for the use
of 32 owners. The Shire has already informed us that they cannot return to empty
these if a vehicle is blocking
their way. This would be a health hazard which
would be worrying. “
55 A third proprietor has referred to Mr. Sharpe in the following terms:
“He continually parks in front of his garage on top of a NO
parking sign written on the driveway. This also happens
to be in front of the 2
large commercial rubbish bins both with Council NO Parking signs on them. In
fact there have been many times
the rubbish truck has arrived whilst he has been
parked there and tooted his horn for someone to shift the vehicle. I believe
rubbish truck driver has complained and commented if it happens again he
will not pick up the rubbish.
He has verbally abused me when I stopped another occupier of Lot
28 who entered the power room and was changing the timer
on the night-lights of
the complex. Neither him nor the other person was on the council. I have heard
him yelling at the top of
his voice and abusing Mrs. May from Unit 20.
There are 2 people who own Lot 28 the above comments apply to
only one owner namely Michael. The other owner Bruce is
most pleasant when
passing in the lift or common areas and always parks in the correct parking
areas. His vehicle that is a similar
on one bay. In my opinion he respects the complex and the strata rules”
59 Another proprietor has reported that the vehicle in question
“... is frequently parked outside his garage, in such a way it
interferes with access to both our rubbish bins and clothes hoist.
parks in our visitors parking bays, so that he occupies two of our five parking
Considerations
61 Lot 28 comprises a residential portion on the 6
floor and a
garage on the ground floor.
62 On the basis of the material before me, and in the absence of any denial by
any of the proprietors of Lot 28, I am satisfied
that the application is
well-founded and that there have been breaches of the Strata Company’s
63 My Orders are that
“No proprietor, occupier or other resident of Lot 28 on Strata
Plan 846 (“the Strata Plan”) shall park or permit
a vehicle to be
parked on any part of the common property comprised in the Strata Plan without
the prior written approval of “The
Owners of The Kurrajongs – Strata
Plan 846” or its Council of Owners.
No proprietor, occupier or other resident of the said Lot 28 shall use or
permit the use of any part of the common property comprised
in the Strata Plan
in such a manner or for such purposes that causes a nuisance to any occupier of
another lot (whether a proprietor
or not) or the family of such an occupier nor
use language or behave in a manner likely to cause offence or embarrassment to
proprietor, occupier or other resident of another lot or to any person
lawfully using any part of the common property comprised in
the Strata Plan.
3. Pursuant to s 81(10), 1 DIRECT that these
Orders shall not cease to be of any force or effect at the
expiration of the
period of 2 years that next succeeds the making of these Orders.
DATED 18 October 2004
