Complainants AS v CSP [2011] VPrivCmr 1 (16 March 2011)
2011 VPrivCmr 1
Complainants AS v Contracted Service Provider to a Department
IPP 6.1 – Access and Correction
Allegation that
the Contracted Service Provider failed to provide access to personal information
it held (IPP 6.1).
Allegation that
the Contracted Service Provider failed to respond to an access request within 45
days of receiving request, and failed
to provide adequate reasons for denial of
access (IPP 6.8).
____________________________________________________________________
The Complainant (AS) applied to the Contracted
Service Provider to a Department (‘the CSP’) on her own behalf for
to personal information held about her. She also applied on behalf of her
young children for access to personal information about
them. The Complainant
initially made a request for access to information to the CSP under the
Freedom of Information Act 1982
(Vic). The CSP responded, stating that it
was not subject to that Act. The Complainant then requested access for
information held
Health Records Act 2001
(Vic). The CSP stated
that it did not hold any ‘health information’ as defined by that Act
and therefore the
Health Records Act
did not apply.
The Complainant then made a request for access to personal information under
Information Privacy Principle (IPP) 6 of the
Information Privacy Act
relation to her own information and her young children’s information (on
their behalf).
The CSP responded after 24 days, explaining that they were seeking legal
Fifty-seven days after the Complainant’s request, the CSP again wrote
to the Complainant and informed her they were awaiting
finalisation of the legal
advice and would communicate with her after it had been received.
One hundred and twelve days after making her request, the Complainant made a
complaint to the Privacy Commissioner on the basis that
the organisation had not
provided her access to personal information the CSP held about her and her
children (IPP 6.1), and had not
provided adequate reasons for the delay within
45 days after receiving her request (IPP 6.8).
Response to the Privacy Commissioner
Soon after the complaint was lodged, the CSP provided part of the file to the
Complainant. However, the Complainant argued that she
considered that the level
of access provided by the CSP was insufficient, and maintained that the CSP was
still failing to comply
with IPP 6.1.
The CSP provided a brief response to the Commissioner, arguing that it had
attempted to comply with IPP 6 based on legal advice and
that it was a small
organisation with limited resources. The CSP also advised that it was releasing
only part of the Complainant’s
file. The organisation argued under that
IPP 6.1(b) the release of any more of the complainant’s and her
children’s personal
information would have an unreasonable impact on the
attend a conciliation meeting.
The Privacy Commissioner explained that IPP 6 requires an organisation to
provide access to personal information held by an organisation
individual.
The Commissioner considered that the use of the term ‘except to the
extent that’ (an exception applies) in IPP 6 indicates
that Parliament
intended that access to personal information held by a Contracted Service
Provider should be provided as fully as
possible, subject only to the exceptions
in IPP 6.1. This interpretation is supported by the Explanatory Memorandum to
the Information
to provide access to personal information
one of the paragraphs in
sub-principle 6.1 applies’ (OVPC emphasis).
The Commissioner considered that the CSP had not outlined any steps it had
taken to consider ways in which it could have provided
more extensive access to
the personal information it held about the Complainant and her children. The
Commissioner gave examples
of methods that the CSP could have used to provide
fuller access. These include ‘notifying/gaining consent of other
individuals,
removing or redacting identifying information of other individuals,
or considering whether or not the release of the information
contained in each
separate document was an ‘unreasonable’ impact on the privacy of
other individuals in each circumstance.’
As a result, the Privacy Commissioner found no reason to decline the
complaint, and referred the complaint to her Office’s conciliation
Although it was not necessary to decide in this complaint, the Privacy
Commissioner also expressed concern about the length of time
taken to respond to
the request, and questioned whether ‘obtaining legal advice’ was a
sufficient reason for delay under
The conciliation
The CSP engaged cooperatively in the conciliation process. The Privacy
Commissioner issued a notice under Section 34 of the
Information Privacy
requiring the CSP to produce the entire file to the Privacy
Commissioner. The CSP complied with the Section 34 notice.
The conciliator subsequently assessed the entire file and discussed with the
CSP different ways to provide more comprehensive access,
and what the
Commissioner might view as an ‘unreasonable impact on privacy’ under
IPP 6.1(b). The conciliator made recommendations
as to how the CSP could reduce
the amount of information that was being withheld, for example, by blacking out
parts of a document,
rather than withholding access to the entire document.
The CSP agreed to the conciliator’s suggestions, and forwarded a more
comprehensive version of the file to the Complainant.
