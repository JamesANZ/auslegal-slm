Holy Cross Laundry v Krystyna Karas and Q-Comp [2009] QIC 34; 192 QGIG 127 (6 October 2009)
[Extract from Queensland Government Industrial
dated 16 October, 2009, Vol. 192, No. 7, page
INDUSTRIAL COURT OF QUEENSLAND
Workers' Compensation
and Rehabilitation Act 2003
- appeal against decision of
industrial magistrate
The Corporation of the Trustees of the Order of
the Sisters of Mercy Queensland Inc trading as Holy Cross Laundry AND Krystyna
and Q-COMP (C/2009/24)
PRESIDENT HALL
6 October 2009
REPORT ON DECISION (as edited)
In giving a Decision from the Bench on 6 October 2009, the President
"By an Application for compensation dated 4 December 2006, Ms Krystyna Karas
sought statutory benefits under the
Workers' Compensation and Rehabilitation
(the Act). She relied on a psychological injury. WorkCover
Queensland rejected the application on the ground that any psychological
suffered by Ms Karas was withdrawn from the statutory definition of 'injury' by
of the Act. There was a Statutory Review. Q-COMP confirmed WorkCover
Queensland's decision. Ms Karas appealed to the Industrial
Magistrates Court.
Ms Karas' employer was granted leave to be heard on the express basis that the
employer was not being made a
party to the proceedings. I accept that in fact
the employer played an active role in the proceedings in the Industrial
Magistrates
Court, e.g. calling and cross-examining witnesses. All of that
allowed for by the express terms of the order which expressly denied
employer the status of a party. In any event, the Industrial Magistrate had no
power to grant the employer the status of a party.
For completeness, I should
add that each of the decisions of this Court supporting the proposition that an
Industrial Magistrate
may grant an employer leave to be heard
Middleton v Teys Bros (Holdings) Pty Ltd
(2001) 166 QGIG and
Queensland v Squires and WorkCover Queensland
(2002) 170 QGIG 20
decided on an early version of the
WorkCover Queensland Act 1996
be doubted whether grant of such leave is consistent with s. 449 of the
Workers' Compensation Act 2003.
The Appeal to the Industrial Magistrates Court succeeded. By an Appeal dated
4 June 2009, the employer purported to appeal to this
Court. For reasons
developed in
Bundaberg Health Service District Queensland Health v
[2006] QIC 8
(2006) 181 QGIG 276
, and which I do not now repeat, the Appeal is
incompetent. Cases such as
Appo v Q-COMP
[2003] QIC 169
(2003) 174 QGIG 1120
applications by employers for leave to be heard in this Court on an appeal
instituted by a party to the proceedings in
the Industrial Magistrates Court and
have no present relevance.
I dismiss the Appeal. I reserve all questions as to costs.".
October 2009.
