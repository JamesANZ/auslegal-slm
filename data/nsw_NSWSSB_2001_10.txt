SCHEME : SP31763
ADDRESS OF : "..."
STRATA SCHEME Darling Point
APPLICANTS : R M Anderson & R D
RESPONDENT : J Cleary & D. Cleary
HEARING : 9 May
2001 at Sydney
orders, by-law
5 damage to common property.
1. The respondents J and D Cleary of Lot 4, "...", Darling Point are ordered to
remove the lattice installed by them on the common
property at the north west
boundary of the pool and garden court area of the lot and replace the same with
the lattice of the type
and in the position as previously
2. Compliance with this order is required by 9 August 2001.
By an appeal lodged with the Registry on 23 March 2001 the appellants R M
Anderson and R D Anderson the owners of lot 5 in the strata
scheme sought to
appeal the decision of the Adjudicator handed down on 28 February 2001. The
Adjudicator made an order dismissing
the application on the grounds that
information requested pursuant to
Section 167
Strata Schemes
Management Act 1996
was not provided and there were no submissions provided
in support of the application.
I am satisfied that the appeal was lodged
within time.
At the hearing held at Sydney on 9 May 2001 the applicants appeared in
person and Ms Jan Cleary appeared and gave evidence on behalf
respondents.
APPLICANTS’ EVIDENCE
The applicants’ evidence is that the respondents changed the lattice
fencing on the boundary, which overlooks their courtyard
pool area sometime in
June 1999 when renovations were being carried out. The original lattice was in
a slightly different location
in that it was slightly higher and the lattice did
not have a hole cut through the middle.
The applicants say that the lattice was altered without the permission of the
owners corporation. They say that it is not in keeping
with other lattices
fences above. Photographs tendered show that there are four garden court
balcony areas which are terraced back
from each other. The top balcony has been
enclosed and the lattice has been replaced by an aluminium fence. The other two
have a lattice without a hole in the middle.
The hole in the lattice affects the privacy of the applicants by allowing those
within lot 4 to look into their television room and
balcony and for the
applicants have view up to the washing line of the respondents.
The applicants’ evidence was that the lattice was installed by the
developer when the property was built.
The applicants say that the altered shape is visible from the street and
provided photographs. However the photographs provided
showed the lattice was
visible from the street but not at the same time as the other lattice,
photographs provided also show that
the hole is visible from the television room
looking upwards and from the terrace looking backwards.
RESPONDENTS’ SUBMISSION
Evidence was given by Ms Cleary on behalf of the respondents and she also relied
on the submission before the Adjudicator.
Ms Cleary’s evidence was that she made changes to the lattice without the
approval of the owners corporation. She did so as
there had been many changes
by other lot owners to the common property. It had previously taken her some
eight months to get plans
passed by the owners corporation for the renovations
she had carried out within the premises and she was reluctant to face further
Her evidence was that she had recently put a motion to the annual general
meeting to seek approval in respect of these and other
alterations. The meeting
has been held but a decision in respect of the motion has been deferred to after
these proceedings are
heard and determined. There was an issue at the meeting
as whether the lattice is part of the lot or forms part of the common property.
Ms Cleary submitted that the new form of lattice creates more privacy for the
applicants as there was previously a gap of some fifty
centimetres from the top
of the brick fence to the bottom of the lattice. She relied on photographs
taken on or around 15 December
2000 from the street. She said that these
photographs show that the differences in the shape of the lattice for the lots
really visible from the street as a view to the lattice is obscured by
trees. She referred to the fact that the lattice had been
changed by other lot
owners in particular the top area, aluminium shutters have been installed and
the area has now been enclosed.
Therefore each of the terraces is no longer the
same. She also said that the applicants have placed plastic mesh across the
of their balcony and placed lattice at each end of the balcony. This
lattice is not repeated anywhere else.
In reply Mr Anderson said the hole in the lattice is visible from the street.
He never previously noticed the gap between the old
lattice and the wall and
that the hole is more noticeable. The plastic mesh at the front of their lot is
irrelevant, it was needed
to stop children and dogs having access under the
balcony. He says it is not intrusive and that other lot owners have used
materials. In respect of the lattice at the side, he said it was there
when he bought the premises.
His submission was that while Ms Cleary draws attention to other matters that
have been done on the premises without owners corporation
approval there is no
record of any objections having been made to those items.
Ms Cleary’s submission was that so much has happened without owners
corporation approval for example, handrails have been installed,
pipes have been
taken through the garage, that these factors should be considered before an
order is made against her.
The first issue to be determined is whether the lattice forms part of the lot or
party of the common property. An examination of
the strata plan shows that the
fence forms part of the boundary of the lot. There are notations on the strata
plan as to the extent
of the lot as regards the pool and garden court area but
those notes do not deal with this issue.
The evidence is that the lattice was in place when the parties purchased their
As the lattice forms part of the boundary fencing and as there are no notations
otherwise on the plan, I consider that the original
lattice formed part of the
common property. That lattice was damaged by the respondents when it was
removed and replaced with what
is now there. Bylaw 5 provides as follows:
5 Damage to common
(1) An owner or occupier of a lot must not mark, paint, drive nails or screws or
the like into, or otherwise damage or deface, any
structure that forms part of
the common property except with the prior written approval of the owners
corporation.
(2) An approval given by the owners corporation under subclause (1) cannot
authorise any additions to the common property.
(3) This by-law does not prevent an owner or person authorised by an owner from
installing:
a) any locking or other safety device for protection of the owner's lot against
intruders or to improve safety within the owner's
(b) any screen or other device to prevent entry of animals or insects on the
(c) any structure or device to prevent harm to children,
(d) any device used to affix decorative items to the internal surfaces of walls
in the owner's lot.
(4) Any such locking or safety device, screen, other device or structure must be
installed in a competent and proper manner and must
have an appearance, after it
has been installed, in keeping with the appearance of the rest of the
(5) Despite
, the owner of a lot
(a) maintain and keep in a state of good and serviceable repair any installation
or structure referred to in subclause (3) that forms
part of the common property
and that services the lot, and
(b) repair any damage caused to any part of the common property by the
installation or removal of any locking or safety device, screen,
other device or
structure referred to in subclause (3) that forms part of the common property
and that services the lot.
It clearly prohibits the respondents from replacing the lattice as they have
done. Having found that there is a breach the next
question to consider is
whether I should make an order requiring compliance with the by-law.
In my view the matters relied on by the applicants outweigh those of the
respondents. The appropriate course for the respondents
was to seek the
approval of the owners corporation before damaging the common property. While I
accept that the respondents were
reluctant to raise the matters because of
delays previously experienced this does not in my view justify taking steps
without the
approval of the owners corporation. The Act provides a system by
which such changes and their effects can be considered and discussed
meetings of the owners corporation or executive committee, and in my view it is
appropriate to require compliance with
the process.
I also consider that the changes would have an impact on the amenity of the
applicants’ use of their lot. While the original
lattice would not block
completely views into their lot it creates a visual barrier made more effective
at a distance. Cutting a
hole into the lattice reduces the applicants’
I have therefore make orders requiring removal of the lattice and replacement of
the same type in the same location.
