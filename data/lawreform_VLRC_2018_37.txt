Access to justice is a proper and continuing concern for governments, the
courts, the legal profession, litigants and the community.
On 16 December 2016,
the Victorian Attorney-General, the Hon. Martin Pakula MP, referred to the
Commission for inquiry and report
three issues under the heading ‘Access
to Justice’. Significantly, at the outset of the terms of reference their
was stated to be ‘to ensure that litigants who are seeking to
enforce their rights using the
services of litigation funders and/or through group proceedings are not
exposed to unfair risks or disproportionate cost burdens’.
The three issues were:
1. Whether there is scope for the supervisory powers of Victorian courts or
Victorian regulatory bodies to be increased in respect
of litigation
2. Whether removing the existing prohibition on law firms charging
contingency fees
(except in areas where contingency fees would be inappropriate, including
personal injury, criminal and family law matters) would
assist to mitigate the
issues presented by the practice of litigation funding.
3. In respect of group proceedings commenced under the provisions of
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) and similar proceedings, whether
there should be further regulation of such proceedings.
Each of the three components—litigation funding, contingency fees, and
class actions (group proceedings) —does, or has
the potential to,
contribute to access to justice. Litigation funding reduces the risks to
litigants of taking proceedings; removing
the ban on contingency fees could
introduce another means of doing so; and class actions take advantage of
economies of scale.
This report, informed by the overarching issue of access to justice and the
aim that litigants are not exposed to unfair risks or
disproportionate cost
burdens, examines the specified issues in the terms of reference, and makes
recommendations in respect of each
In relation to litigation funding, the Commission makes recommendations for
national regulation of the industry and greater transparency
when a litigation
funder is involved in proceedings. The Commission does not recommend fixed caps
or limits on funding costs; rather,
it encourages appropriate court control.
In relation to the prohibition on law firms charging contingency fees, the
Commission recommends that, in principle and in appropriate
areas of law,
lawyers should be allowed to charge contingency fees. This is also a matter
which should be developed nationally, in
the interests of consistency.
In relation to class actions, the Commission’s recommendations seek to
strengthen the Court’s powers, particularly in
ensuring that a successful
outcome is not unduly eroded by legal
and funding fees. The Commission also makes recommendations to improve
efficiency and accountability, which should reduce delays and
associated costs,
but has concluded that the introduction of a pre-commencement certification
requirement is neither desirable nor
The Supreme Court of Victoria has a crucial role in ensuring the just,
efficient, timely and cost- effective resolution of the real
issues in dispute.
In class actions, it has additional broad powers that can be used to protect the
interests of class members. Appropriately,
the terms of reference, and the
Commission’s recommendations, focus on the powers and practices of the
On 15 December 2017, the Commonwealth Attorney-General announced that he had
asked the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) to
inquire into class action
proceedings and third- party litigation funders. The terms of reference for that
inquiry embrace a number
of issues that are considered in this report and
reflect the Commonwealth’s broader jurisdiction to regulate the litigation
funding industry. The inquiry is to be completed by 21 December 2018.
While the Victorian Law Reform Commission has been asked to report on the
question of whether lifting the ban on law firms charging
contingency fees would
assist to mitigate the issues presented by litigation funding, the ALRC has been
asked to report on legal
costs more extensively, namely
‘the costs charged by solicitors in funded litigation, including but
not limited to class action proceedings’.1
Appropriately, the Victorian Law Reform Commission’s terms of reference
focus on the powers and practices of the Supreme Court
of Victoria. However, in
considering reforms, the Commission has taken into account a number of matters
that are also specified in
the ALRC’s terms of reference, notably
conflicts of interest and cost controls, but necessarily has done so from the
perspective
of Victoria’s jurisdiction.
The common procedural form of Australian class action regimes is a valuable
basis on which to ensure they evolve in a broadly consistent
way. Consistency
provides greater certainty for stakeholders, reduces the likelihood of
‘forum shopping’ and encourages
national jurisprudence as to
important procedural and other issues that arise.
However, uniformity is not a necessary end in itself; nor is uniformity
necessary if there is national consistency. It is important
to recognise that
there are differences in the degree to which litigation funders are involved in
class actions, and the types of
class action being filed in each jurisdiction,
particularly as between the Supreme Court of Victoria and the Federal Court.
litigation funders are actively involved in class actions in the Federal
Court, they have been involved in only
10 of the 85 class actions filed in the Supreme Court of Victoria since their
institution in Victoria on
1 January 2000. While mass tort claims, with their onerous logistical
requirements and profound human impacts, have been a significant
part of the
civil jurisdiction in Victoria, the Federal Court receives a preponderance of
shareholder class actions.
In this report, the Commission proposes a pathway—one that should
improve access to justice; provide appropriate regulation
of litigation
funders; maintain proper ethical conduct by lawyers; and not involve unfair or
disproportionate burdens on litigants.
I acknowledge and warmly thank the many judges, legal practitioners,
litigation funders, academics and others who contributed to
this review by
making submissions and by participating in the Commission’s extensive
consultations and roundtables. The reference
made to the Commission by the
Victorian Attorney-General was not only apposite but timely, as it coincided
with the 25th anniversary
of the Commonwealth regime of class actions.
As always, I thank my fellow Commissioners who oversaw the inquiry and have
authorised this report.

Terms of reference
[Referral to the Commission pursuant to
section 5(1)(a)
Law Reform Commission
(Vic) on 16 December 2016.]
Access to Justice—Litigation Funding and Group Proceedings
The Victorian Law Reform Commission is asked to report on the following
issues to ensure that litigants who are seeking to enforce
their rights using
the services of litigation funders and/or through group proceedings are not
exposed to unfair risks or disproportionate
cost burdens.
The Commission is asked to report on:
1. Whether there is scope for the supervisory powers of Victorian courts or
Victorian regulatory bodies to be increased in respect
of proceedings funded by
litigation funders, in particular:
a. whether clearer disclosure requirements should be imposed on litigation
funders and lawyers representing funded plaintiffs in respect
of advice about
the progress, costs and possible outcomes of proceedings; and
b. whether any limits should be placed on (or approval process required in
respect of) the success fees that can be charged by a litigation
plaintiffs when a decision or settlement results in a payment to the plaintiffs
by a defendant; and
c. whether the obligation to disclose funding arrangements in proceedings
supported by litigation funders should be extended beyond
class action
proceedings, and if so, what other types of proceedings should be covered by the
obligation.
2. Whether removing the existing prohibition on law firms charging
contingency fees
(except in areas where contingency fees would be inappropriate, including
personal injury, criminal and family law matters) would
assist to mitigate the
issues presented by the practice of litigation funding.
3. In respect of group proceedings commenced under the provisions of
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) and similar proceedings that involve
a number of disputants being represented by an intermediary, whether there
should be further
regulation of such proceedings, including the possibility
a. a certification requirement before such proceedings are allowed to
continue, either in respect of all such proceedings, or proceedings
supported by litigation funders; or
b. specified criteria for the Court’s approval of a settlement under
section 33V
, and what such criteria might be.
In preparing its report, the Commission is asked to consider among other
a. the implications of any reforms for the workload and resource requirements
Supreme Court; and
b. relevant provisions and potential reforms in other jurisdictions. The
Commission is asked to provide its final report by 30 March

Executive summary
Terms of reference
1 On 16 December 2016, the Attorney-General, the Hon. Martin Pakula MP, asked
the Victorian Law Reform Commission to report on ways
to ensure that litigants
who use the services of litigation funders or participate in group proceedings
(class actions) are not exposed
to unfair risks or disproportionate cost
2 In accordance with the full title of the terms of reference, Access to
Justice—Litigation
Funding and Group Proceedings, the overarching theme of this report is access
justice. Litigation funding and class actions help plaintiffs overcome two
impediments to accessing justice: the cost of bringing
proceedings; and the risk
that, if the litigation is unsuccessful, the plaintiff will be required to pay
the other side’s costs
(adverse costs).
3 The potential for litigants to be exposed to unfair risks and
disproportionate cost burdens arises from the conditions under which
funding is provided, the manner in which class actions operate, and how these
two factors affect each other.
4 Litigation funders commonly agree to pay the costs of bringing proceedings
and adverse costs if the plaintiff loses, in return for
a share of the
settlement or judgment amount if the plaintiff wins. In this way, the financial
risks and costs are shifted from the
plaintiff to the funder.
5 If the litigation is successful, the litigation funder is reimbursed the
costs of the proceedings, and receives a share of the recovered
amount. The
plaintiff must also pay any outstanding costs, such as legal costs that the
litigation funder did not pay. The funding
fee is usually the largest single
cost and the typical range appears to be between
20 and 45 per cent of the recovered amount, although in some insolvency cases
it has been 75 per cent.
6 Class actions create economies of scale that make it cost-effective for
individual claimants to take legal action against a well-resourced
defendant to
recover a small loss. By grouping individual claims from the same, similar or
related circumstances, the cost of bringing
proceedings can be spread across
many claimants. If unsuccessful, the
representative plaintiff is liable for both the cost of bringing the
proceedings and adverse costs. If successful, the cost of bringing
proceedings, as well as the settlement or judgement amount, is shared among the
class members.
7 Large class actions can cost around $10 million to bring, with an adverse
costs risk of a similar amount. This is a significant
financial burden on the
representative plaintiff that is far greater than the value of their individual
claim. The disparity has
created a demand for litigation funding that, in turn,
has fostered an industry. At the same time, class action law and practice
Australia have developed in response to the influence of litigation funders.
8 The Commission has not been asked to investigate whether litigants are
being treated unfairly or charged excessively; rather, the
report focuses on how
to prevent this happening. The terms of reference set out possible reforms to
funded proceedings and class
actions, and raise the question of whether the
existing prohibition on lawyers being able to charge contingency fees should be
9 The Commission’s recommendations are summarised below and set out at
While this report is about funded proceedings and class actions in Victoria,
these issues are the subject of ongoing discussion nationally
and current review
by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC). The recommendations have been
informed by the experience of other
Australian jurisdictions, but grounded in
the context of Victorian circumstances.
Litigation funding and class actions in Victoria
10 Class actions may be brought in the Supreme Court of Victoria under a
regime set out in
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic). Related
rules and procedures are set out
Supreme Court (General Civil Procedure) Rules 2015
the Court’s practice note on the conduct of class actions.
11 Victoria’s class action regime commenced on 1 January 2000. It is
based on Australia’s first class action regime, which
was established in
1992 within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia. The model
generally follows the recommendations
of the ALRC in its seminal 1988 report
Grouped Proceedings in the Federal Court
. Similar regimes were introduced
in New South Wales in 2011 and Queensland in 2017.
12 As at 10 November 2017, 85 class actions had been filed in the Supreme
Court of Victoria. The number each year has fluctuated between
zero and 16; the
annual average is between four and five. Five were filed in 2017.
13 Approximately two-thirds of the class actions commenced in Victoria
settled before trial, leading to the distribution of at least
one billion
dollars to more than 28,300 class members. The two largest class action
settlements in Australia were secured under Victoria’s
class action
regime. Neither involved a litigation funder.
14 While actively involved in class actions in the Federal Court, litigation
funders have
invested in only 10 class actions in Victoria. Eight were claims by
shareholders or investors, and half of these were transferred
to the Federal
15 It is not known how many types of civil proceeding in Victoria, other than
class actions, have involved litigation funders. The
plaintiff’s financial
arrangements and costs in these cases are not subject to the same degree of
court supervision and public
scrutiny as class actions.
16 One funded case that has attracted public attention is a funded claim by
for former employees of Huon Corporation Limited against CBL Insurance Ltd
Huon Corporation)
. The Court found in the trustees’ favour
following a protracted dispute between the parties but, once the costs were paid
the amount awarded, the former employees ultimately received nothing. This
case was discussed in submissions and consultations and
the Commission has used
it as an example in the report.
Role of the Court
17 The Commission’s recommendations reinforce the role of the Supreme
Court of Victoria
in safeguarding litigants from exposure to unfair risks and disproportionate
costs burdens, and in improving efficiency.
18 In all litigation, the Court has broad powers to give effect to the
overarching purpose of the
Civil Procedure Act 2010
(Vic): to facilitate
the just, efficient, timely and cost-effective resolution of the real issues in
19 In class actions, where the outcome affects class members who have not
directly participated in the proceedings, the Court has
additional supervisory
responsibilities to protect the interests of class members. It also has case
management powers to ensure
that the class actions are conducted efficiently,
which reduces costs and delay for all parties.
20 These responsibilities are heightened in funded class actions. The
involvement of a litigation funder creates conflicts of interest
and can affect
the rights of all class members. Significantly, litigation funding was
instrumental in the introduction of closed
actions, which enable class membership to be limited only to class members
who have signed funding agreements. It also led to the
introduction of common
fund orders
for litigation funding costs, which allow a funder to obtain a funding fee
from every registered class member even if they have not
signed a funding
21 Developments such as these increase the need to ensure that the terms on
which funders are involved in class actions, and the relationship
they have with
the lawyers for the representative plaintiff, are transparent both to the Court
and to class members.
22 Similarly, in other funded proceedings where the outcome affects persons
who do not directly participate in the proceedings, as
occurred in
Corporation
, there is a need for greater transparency.
23 The Commission’s recommendations affect the Court’s role and
powers in protecting the interests of class members in
the following ways:
Stronger case management
: The Commission recommends own motion
powers by the Court to order that a proceeding no longer continue as a class
action and to
substitute the representative plaintiff with another class member;
clearer procedures for managing competing class actions; and a
proposal for a
cross-vesting judicial
panel to manage class actions filed in different jurisdictions. The
Commission does not recommend certification because it is unnecessary,
impede access to justice, and had little support in submissions to this
Certainty of powers to control costs
: The Commission makes
recommendations
to clarify the Court’s powers to review and vary costs and make common
fund orders, in which the Court approves the funder’s
percentage share of
the settlement or judgment amount. The Commission does not consider that funding
fees should be subject to statutory
Better information and support for the Court’s protective
: The Commission recommends statutory principles for settlement
approval. Recommendations are made for the Court to consider amending
practice note on class actions to include guidance for the appointment of a
contradictor to
assess the terms of settlement, or the settlement distribution scheme, on
behalf of class members, and to specify the supporting information
that must be
to the Court when settlement approval is sought. The Commission recommends
disclosure of the funding agreement to the Court and other
parties (after
redaction as necessary) in all funded class actions, and to the Court in other
funded litigation where a number of
disputants are represented by an
intermediary.
Better information for class members
: The Commission
recommends that the Court, in upgrading its website, consider publishing clear
information about class actions generally
and specific information about
proceedings before the Court, including summary statements on each class action,
prepared by the representative
plaintiff’s lawyers. The Commission also
recommends that the Court consider drafting standard opt-out and settlement
in Plain English and publishing them on its website.
Responsibilities of plaintiff lawyers
24 In all litigation, lawyers have a fundamental duty to their clients that
has contractual, professional and fiduciary dimensions.
It applies whether or
not a litigation funder is involved.
25 The duty includes responsibilities to avoid or manage conflicts of
interest. In class
actions, the conflicts of interest that lawyers encounter are more complex
than in single- party litigation. For example, there may
be differences between
the interests of the representative plaintiff when compared to class members or
between the class members
themselves. These differences may arise due to the
different nature of the claim or the harm suffered; they may arise from the
categories of class member (for example, whether funded or unfunded);
or they may exist because of the structure of the class action
mechanism, in
which the representative plaintiff has responsibilities that class members do
not share. They can be exacerbated when
a litigation funder is involved,
particularly if the funder actively participates in decisions about how the
class action is conducted.
26 The Commission does not consider further regulation of the legal
profession necessary, as the existing regulation is sufficient
to prevent,
detect or sanction unprofessional conduct. However, there is no formal
recognition of lawyers’ responsibilities
when acting for multiple class
members or guidance on how to manage the conflicts that arise in
class actions. The Commission recommends that professional guidelines be
produced for lawyers on their duties and responsibilities
to all class members
in class actions.
27 Additional measures do not need to be introduced to protect the interests
of plaintiffs in other proceedings in which a litigation
funder is involved.
The plaintiff in single- party cases has direct and ongoing contact with their
lawyer, who should advise the
plaintiff about the terms of the funding
agreement. Unlike class actions, where the funding agreement establishes a
tripartite relationship
between the funder, lawyer and representative plaintiff,
in single-party proceedings the agreement may be bilateral, between the
and plaintiff. If a plaintiff in other funded proceedings brings the
action on behalf of a number of disputants, the lawyer’s only client
will be the plaintiff.
Regulation of litigation funders
28 The courts can supervise the involvement of litigation funders in legal
proceedings only on a case-by-case basis, but state regulation
of litigation
funding is not a viable option because a national response is required.
29 While litigation funding has become integral to Australia’s legal
system, the litigation funding industry is not regulated.
Apart from those
listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), litigation funders in
Australia are free from mandatory licensing,
financial disclosure requirements,
reporting obligations or prudential supervision. A systemic risk
for clients of litigation funders is that the funder may not meet its
obligations under the funding agreement.
30 The Productivity Commission has recommended that litigation funders be
licensed, to ensure that they hold adequate capital to
meet their financial
obligations. Many contributors to this review endorsed the Productivity
Commission’s recommendation and
called for stronger regulation by the
Commonwealth.
31 In December 2017, the Australian Law Reform Commission commenced an
inquiry into whether, and to what extent, litigation funders
should be subject
to Commonwealth regulation. The report is to be completed by 21 December 2018.
In the meantime, Victoria should
press for regulation at a future meeting of the
Council of Australian Governments.
Contingency fees
32 While it is standard practice for litigation funders to charge clients a
percentage of the amount recovered if the claim is successful,
lawyers are not
permitted to charge on this basis. The Commission was asked to report on whether
lifting the ban (except in personal
injury, criminal and family law matters and
other areas in which contingency fees would be inappropriate) would mitigate the
presented by the practices of litigation funding.
33 As a matter of principle, the Commission considers that lawyers should be
able to charge contingency fees, as it provides another
avenue of funding for
clients who may be otherwise unable to pursue proceedings due to the cost. While
their use should be subject
to certain conditions, the need for regulatory
controls is not sufficient reason
to prevent the ban being lifted. The matter requires national consideration,
Commission recommends that this be pursued.
34 Notwithstanding the need for national consideration of the issue, the
Commission believes there is scope for lawyers to be paid
a percentage of the
recovered amount in Victorian class actions, where costs are already borne, and
paid, in a different manner to
other litigation. This would increase competition
with litigation funders, which may
reduce costs in some cases, and enable claims that are not financially viable
investments for litigation funders to be pursued.
Implementation
National dimensions to class action issues
35 The common procedural form of Australian class action regimes is a
valuable basis on which to ensure they evolve in a broadly consistent
Consistency provides greater certainty for stakeholders, reduces the likelihood
of forum shopping and encourages national jurisprudence
as to important
procedural and other issues that arise.
36 However, uniformity is not a necessary end in itself; nor is uniformity
necessary if there is national consistency. It is important
to recognise that
there are differences in the types of class action being filed in each
Supreme Court of Victoria and the
Federal Court:
• The Supreme Court has dealt with more mass tort class actions than
the Federal
Court, and continues to do so. This is the type of claim that the ALRC
expected (in its
1988 report) would be brought as a class action.
• Large commercial claims, particularly shareholder class actions,
which usually attract litigation funding, are more prevalent
in the Federal
• Litigation funders are far more active in the Federal Court. Over the
past five years, the number of funded class actions
brought in the Federal Court
outnumbered the unfunded class actions.
37 These differences may change over time and it is desirable that
innovations continue to develop in a consistent manner across
rather than creating, or appearing
to create, arbitrary distinctions. The Commission’s recommendations are
not intended to entrench current practices, but they
are intended to underpin
best practice as it is perceived now and may develop in the future. If
implemented, they would:
• establish express statutory powers for the Court in place of reliance
on its discretionary powers
• introduce more prescriptive requirements to provide funding
information to the Court and class members
• align practices and powers with those in the other jurisdictions with
class action regimes to support national consistency.
38 The Commission proposes that the recommendations made in this report be
implemented with a view to reinforcing a nationally consistent
Court resources
39 The Supreme Court will need to allocate staff to assist in developing and
introducing the changes, and implementing them into the
future as the
Court’s protective role strengthens and it raises its profile as a source
of information about class actions
generally. The Class Action Coordinators for
the Common Law Division and the
Commercial Court have responsibilities that are affected by many of the
recommendations and may need assistance for their part in
responding to them.
The Commission recommends that the Court consider appointing legally qualified
staff to assist them in implementing
the recommendations.
40 All of the changes will benefit from consultation with stakeholders about
their introduction. The Commission recommends that the
Court consider expanding
its class action user group to include individuals with experience in class
actions, and consult the group
note on class actions, or the production of materials for class members, or any
of the other changes that affect the way in which class actions are conducted
and managed.
Recommendations
[Recommendations in relation to the Supreme Court of Victoria are expressed
with the words ‘The Supreme Court should consider,’
rather than as a
direct recommendation to act, to acknowledge and signify the independence and
standing of the Court.]
1 The recommendations in this report to amend the
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) and the Supreme Court of Victoria’s practice note on class
actions1 should be implemented with the aim of advancing the
consistent regulation and conduct of class actions.
2 The Victorian Government should advocate through the Council of Australian
Governments for stronger national regulation and supervision
of the litigation
funding industry.
3 The Supreme Court should consider amending its practice note on
class actions
to require the disclosure of litigation funding agreements to the Court and
other parties to class actions in similar terms to paragraph
[6] of the Federal
Court of Australia’s practice note on class actions.2
4 In addition to the introduction of disclosure obligations in class
actions, the
Supreme Court should consider requiring the plaintiff’s lawyers to
provide the
Court with a copy of the litigation funding agreement whenever a litigation
funder is involved in a proceeding where a number of
disputants are represented
by an intermediary. Any funding agreement disclosed to the other party should be
to be redacted to conceal information which might reasonably be expected to
confer a tactical advantage on that party.
5 The Supreme Court should consider amending its practice note on class
actions to provide that, if a class action is funded by a
litigation funder:
(a) the representative plaintiff’s lawyers should notify class members
(whether they are actual or potential clients), in clear
terms and as soon as
practicable, of any applicable litigation funding charges and any material
changes to those charges
(b) the obligation to notify is satisfied if class members have been
provided with a document that properly discloses those charges
(c) failure to meet the obligation to notify may be taken into account by the
Court in relation to settlement approval under
section 33V

6 The Supreme Court should consider amending its class action practice note
to require the representative plaintiff’s lawyers
in funded class actions
to provide to the Court, when the writ for the proceeding is filed, a brief
Funding Information Summary
Statement that accurately sets out litigation
funding charges and key conditions in a simplified form, for publication on the
Court’s website.
7 The Attorney-General should propose to the Council of Attorneys-General
(a) agree, in principle, that legal practitioners should be permitted to
charge contingency fees subject to exceptions and regulation
(b) agree to a strategy to introduce the reform, including the preparation
of draft model legislation that regulates the conditions
on which contingency
fees may be charged and maintains the current ban in areas where contingency
fees would be inappropriate.
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) should be amended to
the Court with the power to order a common fund for a litigation services
fee, on application by a representative plaintiff, whereby
the fee is calculated
as a percentage of any recovered amount and liability for payment is shared by
all class members if the litigation
is successful.
Approval of a common fund of this type should be subject to the following
conditions, set out in legislation or the Supreme Court’s
practice note on
class actions, as appropriate:
(a) An application for the order would be sought from the Court at the
commencement of proceedings.
(b) The percentage allocated for the fee would be indicated when the
application is made but approved by the Court at an appropriate
likely at settlement approval.
(c) The litigation services for which the fee is charged should include: all
services provided by the law firm; provision for security
for costs if
required; disbursements; and an indemnity for adverse costs.
9 A certification requirement should not be introduced in Victorian class
Section 33N
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) should be amended
to provide the Supreme Court with the power of its own motion to order that a
proceeding no longer continue
11 The Supreme Court should consider amending its practice note on class
actions to include guidance for the Court and parties on
managing competing
class actions. The guidance should reflect current practice, as it has developed
over time, and allow for the
Court to respond flexibly in the circumstances of
12 The Attorney-General of Victoria should propose to the Council of
Attorneys- General that a cross-vesting judicial panel for class
established. The judicial panel would make decisions regarding the
cross-vesting of class actions, where multiple class
actions relating to the
same subject matter or cause of action are filed in different jurisdictions.
13 The Attorney-General of Victoria should seek the agreement of the
Attorney- General of New South Wales that:
(a) guidelines should be issued to legal practitioners on their duties and
responsibilities to all class members in class actions,
providing specific
direction on the recognition, avoidance and management of conflicts of
(b) the Standing Committee under the Legal Profession Uniform Law should ask
the Legal Services Council to ensure that such guidelines
are produced and
promulgated.
Section 33T
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) should be amended
to empower the Court, of its own motion, to substitute another class member as
representative plaintiff, and
make other such orders as it thinks fit, if it
appears that the representative plaintiff is unable to adequately represent the
of class members.
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) should be amended to
include the principles that govern the exercise of the Court’s power to
approve a proposed settlement,
currently contained in paragraph [13.1] of the
Supreme Court’s practice note on class actions.
16 The Supreme Court should consider amending its practice note on class
actions to include guidance for the appointment of an independent
representative
(commonly known as a contradictor) to assess the terms of settlement, or the
terms of the settlement distribution
scheme, on behalf of class members.
17 The Supreme Court should consider amending paragraph [13.5] of its
practice note on class actions to require the affidavit(s)
in support of
settlement approval to include the following additional matters:
(a) the time at which settlement funds will be received by class members
(b) a mechanism for Court review of disputed decisions of the scheme
administrator where the settlement involves complex individual
assessments
(c) the application of the terms of any litigation funding agreement to the
settlement, if approved
(d) how class members will be kept informed of the settlement distribution
scheme, including measures to ensure the ease of accessibility
communications for class members
(e) the proposed measures that are being taken, in the settlement
distribution scheme, to ensure a just, efficient, timely and cost-effective
outcome for class members.
18 The Supreme Court should consider specifying in its practice note on class
actions that scheme administrators report to the Court:
(a) on a six-monthly basis, or other period as determined by the Court,
regarding the performance of the settlement distribution scheme,
including the
costs involved and the distributions made
(b) at the completion of the settlement distribution scheme, outlining the
distributions made to class members, the time taken for
such distributions, the
amounts charged each class member for distribution, and any outstanding amounts
that were unclaimed by class
members, including what was done with these
outstanding amounts.
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) should be amended to
specify that the Court has the discretion to make any orders in relation to the
distribution of money remaining
after settlement distribution.
20 In revising the pages on its website about class actions, the Supreme
Court should consider ensuring that they contain the following:
(a) current and clear information on class actions generally as well as on
proceedings before the Court
(b) links to the Class Action Summary Statement (Recommendation 23) and, if
applicable, the Funding Information Summary Statement
(Recommendation
6) for each class action
(c) standard form opt-out and settlement notices (Recommendation 21).
21 The Supreme Court should consider drafting Plain English standard form
opt-out and settlement notices, in consultation with the
Victoria Law
Foundation, and publish these on the Court website.
22 The Supreme Court should consider amending its practice note on class
actions to: (a) specify that opt-out notices and settlement
notices should,
where possible,
follow the standard form notices published on the Supreme Court’s
(b) incorporate guidelines for preparing opt-out notices consistently with
those contained in the Federal Court practice note on
class actions.
23 The Supreme Court should consider amending its practice note on class
actions to require the representative plaintiff’s
(a) to provide the Court, when the writ for the proceeding is filed, with a
Class Action Summary Statement for publication on its website
(b) at the same time, or before, make the Class Action Summary Statement
available to class members (whether they are actual or potential
through, for example, publication on the representative plaintiff’s
lawyers website.
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) should be amended to
provide the Court with specific power to review and vary all legal costs,
litigation funding fees and charges,
and settlement distribution costs to be
deducted from settlement amounts to ensure that they are fair and
reasonable.
25 The Supreme Court should consider amending its practice note on class
actions to provide guidance for the appointment of an independent
costs expert
by the Court to assist in the assessment of legal costs and litigation funding
fees. This should
take into account the guidelines contained in the Federal Court practice note
on class actions relating to the use of costs experts.
26 The Supreme Court should consider amending its practice
note on class actions
to specify that, at the first case management conference, the Court, in

10 Structure of this report
1. Introduction
This reference
Referral to the Commission
1.1 By letter dated 16 December 2016, the Attorney-General, the Hon. Martin
Pakula MP, asked the Victorian Law Reform Commission (the
Commission), under
section 5(1)(a)
Victorian Law Reform Commission Act 2000
report on access to justice by litigants who seek to enforce their rights using
the services of litigation funders and/or
through group proceedings. The
referral was publicly announced on 16 January 2017.1
1.2 The terms of reference are set out on page viii.
Scope of the reference
Access to justice
1.3 The overarching theme of the terms of reference, and this report, is
access to justice.
Access to justice is a broad concept that means different things in different
In general terms, it refers to the ability of those who seek to enforce their
rights to use the legal system to obtain an outcome
by means of a fair and open
process. Further significant themes of this report are:
• the appropriate regulation of litigation funders
• maintaining the proper ethical conduct of lawyers
• not imposing unfair or disproportionate burdens on litigants.
1.4 The services provided by litigation funders and the introduction of the
class action
regime in Victoria have enabled more Victorians to obtain redress where legal
action may otherwise have been beyond their reach. At
the same time, there is
concern about the wider impact on the legal system and the rights and interests
of people on whose behalf
funded litigation and class actions are conducted.
1.5 The terms of reference identify in particular the need to ensure that
litigants who use the services of litigation funders and/or
participate in group
proceedings are not exposed to unfair risks and disproportionate cost burdens.
To this end, the Commission is
asked to report on three possible strategies:
• increasing the supervisory powers of Victorian courts or regulatory
agencies in respect of proceedings funded by litigation
• removing the existing prohibition on law firms charging contingency
1 Attorney-General of Victoria, ‘Making Civil Justice Fairer
for Victorians’ (Media Release, 16 January 2017).
• further regulating group proceedings under
Court Act 1986
(Vic) and similar proceedings that involve a number of
disputants being represented by an intermediary.
Litigation funding
1.6 ‘Litigation funding’, as used in the terms of reference and
in this report, refers to an arrangement between a commercial
litigation funder
and one or more potential litigants to pay the costs of the litigation in return
for a share of the award if the
claim succeeds. Arrangements of this type are
also known as ‘third-party litigation funding’ and ‘third-
financing’ because the litigation funder is not a party before the
court—it is a commercial entity that does not represent
the litigant and
has no other interest in the litigation.
1.7 Over the past 20 years, litigation funders have become an accepted
feature of the legal system. They enhance access to justice
by reducing
financial risk and postponing or removing the cost barrier to
participation.2
1.8 In this report, ‘litigation funding’ does not refer to the
financing of legal claims by a party that does not hold
itself out in the
marketplace as a litigation funder. Private loans to a plaintiff to assist in
meeting the costs of bringing proceedings,
or other private financial
undertakings, are not included. In addition, ‘litigation funder’
does not refer to
a government agency or an insurer, or a lawyer working pro bono or under a
‘no win, no fee’ costs agreement.3
Contingency fees
1.9 The Commission has been asked to report on whether removing the existing
prohibition on law firms charging contingency fees (except
in personal injury,
criminal and family law matters and other areas in which contingency fees would
be inappropriate) would help
to mitigate the issues presented by the practice of
litigation funding. These issues have been identified during the reference
• the selection of cases to fund
• the amount charged
• the priority given to the funder’s commercial interests over
the plaintiff’s or class members’ interests.
1.10 ‘Contingency fees’ has a specific meaning in this context.
It refers only to the practice of charging clients a percentage
of the amount
recovered if the claim is successful. While
this is standard practice among litigation funders, lawyers are not permitted
to charge on this basis. It has been suggested that
contingency fees may improve
access to justice by providing a means of financing legal claims that are not
viable investments for
litigation funders.
1.11 Currently, legal costs can depend on the outcome of the litigation, but
the amount that may be charged is based on the lawyer’s
regular fee, not
on the amount recovered on the client’s behalf. If the claim succeeds, a
lawyer acting under a ‘no win,
‘conditional’ cost agreement charges an amount based on their
regular fee for the work done, plus an ‘uplift fee’
of up to an
additional 25 per cent of the regular fee. Law firms commonly charge on a
‘no win, no fee’ basis in class
actions, including when a litigation
funder is involved.

3 The narrow definition is determined by the terms of reference and is
effectively confined to commercially available funding for
plaintiffs. As noted
in the submission by LCM, in some contexts the distinction between this and
other sources of funding, such as
funding available to
defendants under an insurance policy, can be somewhat artificial: Submission
Group proceedings (class actions)
1.12 In Victoria, a ‘group proceeding’ is the procedure whereby a
single representative can bring or conduct a claim on
behalf of others in the
same, similar or related circumstances. Procedures of this type are commonly
called ‘class actions’,
so this report refers to group proceedings
as class actions except when discussing specific provisions in legislation.
1.13 Class actions provide access to justice for class members by allowing
them to share the costs of taking legal action, each paying
less than the cost
of bringing separate proceedings. Combining multiple claims into a single class
action also reduces the defendant’s
costs and the court’s
1.14 Australia’s first class action regime was established on 4 March
Federal Court of Australia Act 1976
into effect. It applies to class actions brought under the jurisdiction of the
Federal Court of Australia and is based
on the recommendations of the Australian
Law Reform Commission in its seminal 1988 report
Grouped Proceedings in the
Federal Court
1.15 A similar regime has operated in Victoria since 1 January 2000, enabling
class actions to be conducted under the jurisdiction
of the Supreme Court of
Victoria. It was initially established by Supreme Court rules.5 Previous rules
had allowed for a representative
action procedure but had been interpreted
narrowly and fell into disuse.6 The Victorian Parliament subsequently passed
Courts and Tribunals Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2000
(Vic), which introduced part 4A into the Supreme Court Act.7
Supreme Court Act
is substantially the same as
of the Federal Court Act. Although the terms of reference concern the operation
of Victorian law, most class action litigation has
been conducted in the Federal
Court, and some of the most significant decisions have been made under the
Commonwealth legislation.
As the two regimes are similar, the Commission has
drawn from the experience of both jurisdictions in preparing this report.
1.17 The Commission has also taken into account the class action regimes that
were introduced in New South Wales8 in 2011 and in Queensland9
in 2017. They
are also modelled on the Commonwealth legislation.
The Commission’s process
1.18 The Commission Chair exercised his powers under section 13(1)(b) of the
Victorian Law
Reform Commission Act to constitute a Division to guide and oversee the
the reference. The Commissioners who joined him on the Division were: Helen
Fatouros; His Honour David Jones AM; Alison O’Brien;
and the Hon. Frank
Vincent AO QC. All Commissioners considered and approved this report.

Consultation paper
1.19 The Commission published a consultation paper on 17 July 2017 which
posed a series of questions and invited written submissions
by 22 September
2017. On request, submissions continued to be accepted after this date until 10
December 2017.
1.20 In preparing the consultation paper, the Commission was greatly assisted
by the insights given by lawyers, litigation funders,
judicial officers,
academics and regulators during informal discussions held in May and June 2017.
The paper was otherwise based
on an examination of case law, relevant literature
and the reports of earlier reviews.
Submissions
1.21 The Commission received 36 submissions, and they are listed at Appendix
Consultations
1.22 The publication of the consultation paper marked the beginning of formal
consultations.
Lawyers, litigation funders, academics and regulators were invited to
participate in a series of roundtables in September and October
2017. Class
members and others who could discuss the issues from a client’s
perspective attended a roundtable on 31 October
2017 to share their experience of the class action process and their views on
the need for reform.
1.23 In addition, separate discussions were held with judges and other
contributors throughout the reference. The consultations are
listed at Appendix
Other reviews
1.24 Class actions, litigation funding, and the ban on law firms charging
contingency fees have been subjects of protracted debate
and various reviews
over the past 25 years. Three reviews in particular have stimulated and shaped
discussion of the issues and are
frequently mentioned in this paper:
• the Australian Law Reform Commission’s report
Proceedings in the Federal
• the Victorian Law Reform Commission’s
Civil Justice Review
• the Productivity Commission’s report

Australian Law Reform Commission (1988)
1.25 The Australian Law Reform Commission’s report on grouped
proceedings in the Federal Court put forward recommendations for
a class action
regime and included a draft Bill to establish it. As noted above,
the Federal Court Act is broadly based on that report.
1.26 Today, the report remains the first point of reference for discussion

Victorian and other regimes that have been based on it, and the merits of
proposed reforms.
1.27 In a subsequent report on the adversarial system of litigation,
published in 2000,
the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) discussed the procedural and
ethical issues which arise in class actions and made recommendations
efficiency, transparency and fairness. It did not support the lifting of the ban
on lawyers being able to charge contingency

Victorian Law Reform Commission (2008)
1.28 In 2008, the Victorian Law Reform Commission completed a wide-ranging
review of the civil justice system. The report contained
177 recommendations to
make civil litigation cheaper, simpler and fairer. Many were implemented by the
Civil Procedure Act 2010
(Vic). Among the recommendations were:
• the introduction of new requirements for the disclosure of the
identity of litigation funders and insurers exercising control
proceedings14
• legislative amendments to improve remedies in class actions15
• a call to reconsider the prohibition on lawyers charging contingency
1.29 The Commission has revisited some of the issues that it examined during
the 2008 review.
Developments in class action procedure, the commercialisation of law
practices and the growth of the litigation funding industry have
substantially
changed the context within which they need to be considered.

report discussed dispute resolution in Australia, with a focus on constraining
costs and promoting access to justice and equality
before the law. Private
funding of litigation was among the comprehensive range of issues addressed by
the report.
1.31 The following recommendations of the Productivity Commission are of
particular relevance to the current review:
• establish a licence for litigation funding companies to verify their
capital adequacy and properly inform clients of relevant
obligations and systems
for managing conflicts of interest
• remove the ban on lawyers being able to charge contingency fees,
except in family and criminal law matters, and apply a percentage
sliding scale
• amend court rules to ensure that the court’s discretionary
power to award costs against non-parties, and obligations
to disclose funding
agreements, apply equally to lawyers charging a contingency fee and litigation
Australian Law Reform Commission (2017)
1.32 On 15 December 2017, the Commonwealth Attorney-General announced that he
had asked the ALRC to inquire into class action proceedings
and third-party
litigation funders. The terms of reference for the inquiry embrace a number of
issues that are discussed in this
report and reflect the Commonwealth’s
broader jurisdiction to regulate the litigation funding industry. The inquiry is
completed by 21 December 2018.
1.33 Appropriately, the Victorian Law Reform Commission’s terms of
reference focus on the powers and practices of the Supreme
Court of Victoria. In
considering reforms, the Commission has taken into account a number of matters
that are also specified in the
ALRC’s terms of reference, notably
conflicts of interest and cost controls, but is necessarily doing so from the
perspective
of Victoria’s jurisdiction.

1.34 While the Commission has been asked to report on the question of whether
lifting the ban on law firms charging contingency fees
would assist to mitigate
the issues presented by litigation funding, the ALRC has been asked to report on
legal costs more extensively,
namely ‘the costs charged by solicitors in
funded litigation, including but not limited to class action
proceedings’.18
1.35 The Commission met with the President of the ALRC and staff following
the institution of the ALRC inquiry.
International comparisons
1.36 The challenges and reform options that the terms of reference raise are
being addressed internationally. While it is wrong to
expect that replicating
the policies and laws of another country will create the same results in
Victoria, it is prudent to take
account of overseas experience when exploring
ways to resolve local issues.
1.37 The experience of three overseas jurisdictions is particularly relevant
to this review:
The United States
, because the Australian Law Reform
Commission drew from the law and experience of the United States when
recommending a class action
regime for Australia. The legal profession in the
United States has long been able to charge contingency fees and—unlike
in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom—plaintiffs in the
United States do not face the risk of paying the other side’s
costs if the
litigation is unsuccessful.
England and Wales
, which has a national self-regulatory scheme
for litigation funders overseen by the Association of Litigation Funders of
and Wales. England and Wales has recently removed the blanket
prohibition on lawyers being able to charge contingency fees, to a
response from the legal profession. In addition, there is extensive use of
‘after the event’ insurance. Comparisons
must be made with care,
because the litigation funding market is quite different to that in Australia
for a number of reasons, and
so are the issues.
, which does not have a large litigation funding
industry, and now also allows lawyers to charge contingency fees, although the
regulations
vary between the provinces.19 Contingency fees are mainly charged in
personal injury actions20 but
are less common in Canada than the United States. In Ontario, a public fund
provides funding for certain class actions.
1.38 These and other features of the approaches taken by other countries are
considered in this report where relevant to the issues
under discussion.
National context for reform
The need for a nationally consistent approach
1.39 Although the terms of reference properly concern proceedings in
Victorian courts, decisions about whether to introduce reforms,
and which are
most suitable, need to
take national implications into account. The Commission agrees with the Law
Australia’s observation that:
18 Australian Law Reform Commission,
Australian Law Reform Commission
Terms of Reference—Inquiry into Class Action Proceedings and
Third Party Litigation Funders
(15 December 2017) <https://
www.alrc.gov.au
19 Law societies across Canada regulate the amount, or percentage, a lawyer
can charge to a client under a contingency fee agreement.
For example, the
British Columbia
Law Society Rules 2015
state that, unless a court
otherwise orders a higher remuneration, a lawyer cannot claim more than 331/3%
of the amount received for
any personal injury or wrongful death arising out of
a motor vehicle accident, and no more than 40% in any other claim for personal
injury or wrongful death: pt 8, r 8–2(1).
20 Law Society of Ontario,
Seventh Report of the Advertising & Fee
Arrangements Issues Working Group
, Contingency Fee Recommendation
Report (November 2017) 12
http://www.lsuc.on.ca /advertising-fee-arrangements
For the legal system to be seen as enabling access to justice and for the
community to be confident in the justice system, we should
have consistent
regimes throughout Australia as much as possible. 21
1.40 The reasons are well established and uncontroversial yet bound to be
revisited whenever reforms to state and territory law are
proposed. Without
exception, the views expressed in submissions and during consultations for this
report either called for, or implied
there should be, a nationally consistent
approach to proceedings funded by litigation funders and class actions.
1.41 While views differed about whether regulation of litigation funders is
necessary, it was made clear that Victoria should not
act unilaterally. Most
submissions called for the national regulation of the litigation funding
industry, and the Commission agrees.22
1.42 With regard to class actions, stakeholders observed that
consistency:
• provides greater certainty, of benefit to all stakeholders23
• reduces the likelihood of forum shopping and the making of borderline
claims to attract a particular jurisdiction24
• encourages the development of national jurisprudence as to the
important procedural and other issues that arise.25
1.43 Clearly, the class action regimes in Australia are intended to operate
in a nationally consistent way because they have been
established by similar
legislation, first enacted
in 1992 as part IVA of the Federal Court Act. This has enabled national
jurisprudence to develop, as noted by the Supreme Court of
Sensibly, State legislation mirrors (almost entirely) the federal model,
allowing learnings in the federal sphere to be translated
to the State sphere
and vice versa. There is a constant cross-pollination of decisions and
principles derived from those decisions.26
1.44 Having nationally consistent class action regimes, with a common
procedural form, does not mean a prescriptive approach should
be taken to case
management. One of the strengths of Australia’s class action regimes is
the court’s ability to respond
flexibly in response to the circumstances
of each case. In Victoria, the Supreme Court has a broad power under
Supreme Court Act
to ‘make any order the Court thinks
appropriate or necessary to ensure that justice is done in the
proceeding’. The Court
has deliberately maintained significant flexibility
in its class actions practice:
Each case requires individual management adapted to its peculiar features,
such as proceedings involving:
• A large class where the identity of each individual is at the time
of commencement unknown or a small class of clearly identifiable
individuals
• A single defendant or multiple defendants
• A complicated factual basis or relatively straightforward
• A class of individuals with litigation and commercial experience
seeking redress in relation to commercial dealings or a class
of individuals
with personal injuries who have never previously engaged with the court
• A litigation funder or where the plaintiff’s lawyers are acting
on a [no win, no fee] basis.27

1.45 The Federal Court judges with whom the Commission consulted also
stressed the importance of being able to respond flexibly and
of avoiding overly
prescriptive legislative amendments and procedural guidance.28
1.46 Although the legislation underpinning class actions in Australia today
is substantially unchanged since the Commonwealth regime
was introduced in 1992,
the types of proceedings that are now brought before the courts, and the way
they are financed and structured,
are not as envisaged at that time.29 Justice
Jack Forrest reflected on the difference at a recent panel discussion:
If you’re ever minded to read the Law Reform Commission Report of 1988
which preceded the introduction of
of the Federal Court Act,
you’ll think it was
drafted by someone living on Mars. It has no resemblance now to how we
conduct class action litigation in this country at all. It
envisaged open
classes, and it envisaged mass tort claims, and really no more than that.30
1.47 Courts have been able to rely on broad statutory powers, and their
inherent powers, to adapt to changing conditions arising from
the growth of the
litigation funding industry, legal entrepreneurialism, technological change and
government policy decisions. There
is strong support among stakeholders for the
courts to continue to be able to respond flexibly on a case-by-case
basis—while
also supporting a nationally consistent approach where
The Commission’s approach
1.48 The Commission does not recommend major reform to the Supreme
Court’s powers, procedures and practices in funded proceedings
actions. The Court does not seek it and few contributors to the review have
called for it.
1.49 Over time, the management of class actions has improved. Courts, law
firms and litigation funders have learnt through experience,
legal procedures
have become well established and the body of case law has grown. Issues that
were problematic a decade ago have
been resolved; many challenges to the fair
conduct of class actions have been overcome.
1.50 The Commission’s recommendations support the role of the Supreme
Court in class actions as it has evolved, especially in
ensuring that the
interests of unrepresented class members are taken into account throughout the
proceedings. Further recommendations
are made regarding other types of
proceedings in which funders may be involved.
1.51 The recommendations are not intended to entrench current practices
at the expense of innovation, but to underpin best practice
as it is perceived
now and may develop in the future. If implemented, they would:
• establish express statutory powers for the Court in place of reliance
on its discretionary powers
• introduce more prescriptive requirements to provide funding
information to the Court and class members
• align practices and powers with those in the other jurisdictions with
class action regimes to support national consistency.
1.52 The need for each recommendation is discussed later in the report, yet
the following recurring themes will be apparent in the
reasons for reform:
28 Consultation 2 (Judges of the Federal Court of Australia).
29 For example, while the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) envisaged
mass tort class actions being run on an open basis, the
most prevalent types of
class action filed in the Federal Court since the introduction of the regime
have been investor and shareholder
class actions: Vince Morabito,
Empirical Study of Australia’s Class Action Regimes, Fifth Report: The
First Twenty-Five Years of Class Actions in Australia
(July 2017) 39–
40. Closed class actions, although declining in use since October 2013, have
also been common in Federal Court
proceedings. Unlike open class proceedings
(which were envisaged by the ALRC), closed class actions allow participation in
proceedings
to be restricted by reference to funding criteria, for example, that
the class member has executed a funding agreement.

• The number of law firms and litigation funders
involved in class actions is increasing.
Clear statutory powers and more comprehensive court procedures are likely
assist newcomers to understand the court’s role, what is expected of
them, and the differences between class actions and other
litigation.
• While the ability to rely on broad discretionary powers enables the
court to respond flexibly, it also creates opportunities
for legal dispute about
the matters for decision, adding to the legal costs borne by the parties.
Further, some important developments
in court practices do not have express
statutory footing and could be open to legal challenge.
• A nationally consistent approach to class actions should be
transparently so, especially with the growth in the number of
class action regimes. Otherwise, importance will be attached to real or apparent
differences, which could encourage
forum shopping.
1.53 Before turning to the substantive recommendations, the Commission wishes
to make clear that, even though it is essential that
the Court is able to
respond flexibly to the circumstances of each class action proceeding, a
nationally consistent approach remains
Recommendation
The recommendations in this report to amend the
Supreme Court
(Vic) and the Supreme Court of Victoria’s practice note on
class actions31 should be implemented with the aim of advancing
the nationally
consistent regulation and conduct of class actions.
Structure of this report
1.54 The report examines the regulation of proceedings funded by litigation
funders, followed by a discussion of whether contingency
fees would mitigate
litigation funding issues.
It then turns to the regulation of class actions. Court resources are
discussed at the conclusion of the report.
1.55 Chapter 2 discusses the effect that litigation funders have had on
improving access to justice and the regulatory challenges
presented by the
growth of the litigation funding industry. The introduction of a participant who
is not a party to the proceeding,
but has a financial stake in how it is
conducted and the result achieved, changes the dynamics
of the proceeding and raises the risk that it will not be a fair process or
produce a fair outcome. Calls for national regulation,
and proposals concerning
disclosures to the court and the parties, and cost controls, are discussed in
this context.
1.56 Whether allowing lawyers to charge contingency fees would mitigate
issues with litigation funding practices is examined in Chapter
Commission concludes that, in principle, lawyers should be able to charge
contingency fees, subject to regulation, because
would provide another funding option for clients who are unable to bring
proceedings without financial assistance. The ban has been
the subject of debate
for many years and is a national issue which involves broader considerations
than the impact on litigation
funding. However, there is scope for Victoria to
introduce contingency fees for lawyers
within class actions to enable a broader range of claims to be brought,
without lifting the ban unilaterally, and a proposal for doing
so is set out in
the second part of the chapter.

1.57 Chapters 4 and 5 discuss class actions in Victoria. Chapter 4 considers
improving procedural efficiencies to ensure that litigants
are not exposed to
disproportionate cost burdens. Proposals regarding certification and the
management of multiple class actions
and settlement distribution are discussed.
Because of the representative nature of class action proceedings, it is also
that the parties running the proceedings on behalf of class members
are accountable to them. The chapter examines the role of the
representative
plaintiff’s lawyers, the litigation funder, the representative plaintiff
the court in class actions, and discusses ways to improve accountability. It
concludes with proposals to improve communication with
class members to ensure
that they are aware of any risks or costs involved in proceedings, and can
protect their interests accordingly.
1.58 Chapter 5 responds directly to the issue of disproportionate cost
burdens for litigants raised in the terms of reference. It
discusses how the
risks of losing and the costs of winning, inherent in litigation, are structured
in class actions. As class members
have little ability to negotiate these costs,
the supervisory role of the court is important in
ensuring that costs are fair and reasonable. The Commission makes
recommendations to strengthen the court’s role.
1.59 In preparing this report, the Commission was asked to consider the
implications of any reforms for the workload and resource
requirements of the
Supreme Court of Victoria. Court resources are discussed in Chapter 6, along
with an overview of how technology
is changing the way civil litigation is
managed and funded.

2. Litigation funding and access to justice
Introduction
2.1 The entry of litigation funding into Australia’s legal system, and
the growth over the past
20 years in the number of providers and diversity of services they offer,
have improved access to justice. Litigation funders have
enabled plaintiffs to
bring legal action that they would not have otherwise contemplated because of
the financial risks of losing.
2.2 Under the costs-shifting rule, the losing party is usually ordered to pay
the other side’s reasonable legal costs (an adverse
costs order). The
prospect of being burdened with an adverse costs order if the litigation is
unsuccessful, in addition to their
own legal costs, is particularly daunting in
class actions, where the representative plaintiff alone is liable and the costs
significant.
2.3 In large class actions, the representative plaintiff will commonly be
charged around
$10 million in legal costs, plus disbursements, even though their individual
claim may be for a few thousand dollars. They could also
have to pay as much
again, or more, in adverse costs if the litigation is unsuccessful. Few legal
firms have the financial capacity
to provide their services on a ‘no win,
no fee’ basis in a class action. Where they do, the
representative plaintiff will be relieved of paying their own legal costs if
they lose but will remain liable for adverse costs and
disbursements.1
2.4 The costs-shifting rule creates a financial risk that litigation funders
are able to underwrite, and fosters demand for the financial
assistance they
provide. The funder reduces the risk for the plaintiff by covering their legal
costs and indemnifying them against
an adverse costs order, in return for a
share of the recovered amount if the claim succeeds. The
market for litigation funders in Australia has grown in the absence of local
competition from forms of financial assistance that are
employed overseas to
mitigate the risk of losing: ‘after the event’ insurance, and
lawyers charging contingency fees.2
2.5 Litigation funders are providing services which were illegal until 1967
and have expanded incrementally since then. They have
been permitted to fund
insolvency proceedings since
1996 and were first seen in class actions in 2001. They were not recognised
by the High Court as a legitimate means of funding multi-party
proceedings until
2006.3 Over the five-year period from 1 June 2012 to 31 May 2017, they funded
46.2 per cent of all class actions
nationally.4

2.6 Procedural developments in response to the involvement of litigation
funders in class actions have also encouraged the litigation
funding market to
grow. For example, judicial acceptance of closed class actions,5 which allow
class membership to be limited to
class members who have signed funding
agreements, contributed to a surge in the number of funded class actions filed
in the Federal
Court from 2008.6 It has also been suggested that the approval of
common fund orders for litigation funding costs, which allow a
litigation funder
to obtain a funding fee from every registered class member even if they have
not signed a funding agreement, will
encourage continued growth in the
2.7 Although much of the discussion about litigation funding in this report
focuses on class actions, this is only one aspect of the
industry. Litigation
funders continue to invest
in insolvency proceedings, as well as in other areas of law such as
commercial and contractual disputes, intellectual property and
2.8 In addition, sophisticated and diverse products for a broader range of
markets have been emerging. For example, funding is now
offered to law firms
against a portfolio of different cases, where the funder’s return depends
on the overall net financial
performance of the portfolio as opposed to the
outcome of any particular claim.8
Litigation funders also offer finance for specific risks and costs, such as
compliance with an order to provide security for costs,
or the payment of
disbursements. Some funders provide ‘after the event’ insurance,
which may be taken out at the beginning
of, or during, proceedings to protect
against the risk of having to pay adverse costs.
2.9 Another trend has been for litigation funders to provide funds direct to
companies, rather than through an arrangement with a
law firm. The company uses
its litigation as collateral to secure the finance in order to pursue or defend
a claim (by, for example,
its in-house legal team) or for other corporate
2.10 As companies increasingly operate globally, there has been an upsurge in
international disputes that the parties seek to resolve
through international
commercial arbitration. The value of the claims can be very high. Large
established international litigation
funders are actively pursuing the
opportunity to fund these disputes and provide additional services, such as
enforcing arbitral
awards. In Hong Kong and Singapore, where traditional
restrictions on litigation funding remain in place, exceptions have been made
permit litigation funding in international commercial arbitration.9
2.11 Perhaps not surprisingly, hedge funds and private equity houses are
seeing investment in litigation as an attractive ‘alternative
class’ with returns that are uncorrelated to movements in the stock market
or bond returns.10
2.12 In Australia, even though there has been an increase in the predominance
and impact of litigation funders in civil proceedings,
the industry is only
lightly regulated.11 The Productivity Commission has recommended strengthening
the existing Commonwealth regulation.
Concern about the continued lack of
national oversight of the industry was expressed in several submissions and
during consultations.
While this is not a topic within the terms of reference,
the absence of robust Commonwealth regulation means that parties to funded
litigation need to rely more on the courts, and court processes, to

11 The ‘light touch’ approach to regulating litigation funders
has also been adopted internationally. In England and Wales,
there is voluntary
self-regulation; in Hong Kong and Singapore, litigation funders are
self-regulated but may operate only in international
arbitration; in the United States of America, regulation varies between the
safeguard their interests. For this reason, the chapter begins with a
discussion of the need for national regulation.
2.13 In Victoria, there is scant reference to litigation funders in
legislation and court procedures. The terms of reference ask the
Commission to
report on whether there
is scope for the supervisory powers of Victorian courts or Victorian
regulatory bodies to be increased in respect of proceedings funded
by litigation
funders, in particular by increasing disclosure obligations or controlling
2.14 The initiatives suggested in the terms of reference, and raised during
the Commission’s review, need to be considered in
the context of the
problems they are intended to address. This chapter provides an overview of
litigation funding practices and the
issues they raise. It then discusses
proposals concerning disclosure and the control of funding fees in funded
litigation generally.
Cost controls in funded class actions is discussed in
2.15 The question of whether the issues presented by litigation funding would
be mitigated by removing the existing prohibition on
law firms charging
contingency fees is examined in Chapter 3.
National regulation of litigation funders
Maintenance and champerty
2.16 For centuries, financial services of the type offered by litigation
funders were illegal. They were proscribed by the torts
and offences of
maintenance (providing financial assistance to a litigant without lawful
justification) and champerty (a form of
maintenance involving the sharing of the
proceeds of litigation). The policy underlying the offences was to prevent the
legal system
from being subverted by persons who were not parties to proceedings
but had a financial interest in the outcome.
2.17 Criminal and civil liability for maintenance and champerty was abolished
in Victoria
Abolition of Obsolete Offences Act 1969
(Vic) and similarly in
other Australian jurisdictions.12 However, the underlying policy of the law was
retained: a contract can still
be treated as contrary to public policy or
illegal if it is found to be in aid of maintenance or champerty.13
2.18 Uncertainty about the legality of any financial agreement between a
third-party funder and a litigant to assist the litigation
in return for reward
was overcome by two judicial decisions:
• The 1996 Federal Court decision in
Movitor Pty Ltd (rec and mgr
apptd) (in liq)
14 allowed for commercial litigation funders to raise capital to
provide funding to insolvency practitioners.15
• The 2006 High Court decision in
Campbells Cash & Carry Pty Ltd
v Fostif Pty Ltd
) provided certainty that litigation
funders have a legitimate role in financing multi-party proceedings, including
class actions,
and can exercise broad influence over how they are conducted.
2.19 While endorsing the funder’s role in
, the High Court
acknowledged that the involvement of a third-party litigation funder can corrupt
court processes. However, it concluded
that the court could rely on its inherent
powers if necessary to address

any difficulties that arise, on a case-by-case basis. Any particular problems
found in proceedings financed by a litigation funder,
including class actions,
could be solved through court procedures for that type of proceeding. Any
associated conflict of interest
issues for lawyers could be addressed by their
duties to the court and professional rules.17
2.20 One of the strongest messages emerging from the Commission’s
consultations is how well the judicial system has responded
to issues that have
arisen in individual cases as
the litigation funding industry has grown and the number and types of class
actions have changed. As noted in Chapter 1, there is
broad support for the
courts continuing to be able to exercise broad discretion in managing class
action proceedings. This support
is distinct from, and accompanied by, calls
for stronger systemic regulation of the
industry itself.
Calls for stronger regulation
2.21 The courts can supervise the involvement of litigation funders in legal
proceedings only on a case-by-case basis. Systemic protection
from the risk of
the legal system being subverted by the activities of third-party litigation
funders calls for industry-wide
regulation. Moreover, legislation—rather than court procedure—is
the appropriate vehicle for reform where policy issues
are involved.
2.22 In a series of decisions between 2009 and 2012, the courts found that
litigation funding should be regulated under existing legislation
variously as a
financial product,18 a managed investment scheme,19 and a credit facility.20
The Commonwealth Government’s
response to the decisions was to legislate to minimise consequential
regulatory burdens. It declined to regulate litigation funders
to the same
degree or in the same way as providers of other financial, investment or credit
services. There was concern that if they
were subject to stronger regulation,
they would pass on the costs to consumers and thereby reduce access to
2.23 Litigation funders operating in Australia are free from mandatory
licensing, financial disclosure requirements, reporting obligations
prudential supervision, unless they are listed on the Australian Securities
Exchange.22 Unlike other providers of financial
products and services,
litigation funders are not required to hold an Australian Financial Services
Licence (AFSL). They are exempt
from the requirement as long as they have
adequate practices in place to manage conflicts of interest.23 Failure to have
such practices
in place and follow certain procedures for managing conflicts is
an offence.24
2.24 The exemption is provided by the Corporations Regulations.25 The
Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has
issued a regulatory

Regulatory Guide
248—Litigation Schemes and Proof of Debt Schemes: Managing
Conflicts of Interest
(April 2013).
2.25 The Commonwealth Government is under pressure to strengthen the
regulation of the litigation funding industry. In particular,
there have been
calls for litigation funders to be licensed to ensure that they hold adequate
capital to manage their financial obligations.27
This is seen as a way to protect plaintiffs and defendants from an
impecunious litigation funder by ensuring that the funder has adequate
and liquidity to meet its obligations under the litigation funding
2.26 In its 2014 report Access to
Justice Arrangements
Productivity Commission concluded that the potential barriers to entry created
through licensing requirements were justified
in order to ensure that only ‘reputable and capable funders enter the
market’.28 It recommended that:
The Australian Government should establish a license for third party
litigation funding companies designed to ensure they hold adequate
relative to their financial obligations and properly inform clients of relevant
obligations and systems for managing risks
and conflicts of interest.
• Regulation of the ethical conduct of litigation funders should remain
a function of the courts.
• The licence should require litigation funders to be members of the
Ombudsman Scheme.
• Where there are any remaining concerns relating to categories of
funded actions, such as securities class actions, these should
be addressed
directly, through amendments to underlying laws, rather than through any further
restrictions on litigation funding.29
2.27 Many submissions conveyed unease about the limited regulation of the
industry and expressed support for the Productivity Commission’s
recommendations. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, for example,
called for greater regulatory controls:
While we support the role that third party litigation funders can play we are
concerned that in the current unregulated environment,
the rise of funders
utilising litigation as an investment vehicle has been largely unchecked. This
has introduced potential for
misuse and unintended impacts on the productivity
and cost of doing business. The continuing evolution of funding participants and
models has the potential to extend the impact of such funding. We believe that
regulation is required to protect the validity of
the legal process and the
legitimate interests of plaintiffs and defendants. The recommendations of the
Victorian Law Reform Commission
from 2008 and the Productivity Commission from
2014 remain valid, particularly in relation to licencing and capital
adequacy.30
2.28 The Australian Institute of Company Directors observed that courts do
not have the time or expertise to properly assess the prudential
position of
litigation funders. It identified uncertainty, in the absence of any form of
licensing, about whether:
• only fit and proper persons may provide funding services
• adequate conflict management processes are in place
• the terms of litigation funding agreements can be enforced against
foreign litigation funders.31

2.29 Allens also endorsed the Productivity Commission’s
recommendations. It proposed
that minimum content standards for all litigation funding agreements be
mandated by legislation, adding that regulation at the state
level might be
necessary if Commonwealth legislation is not introduced.32 Additional comments
in support of a licensing scheme
for litigation funders, or other prudential regulation by the Commonwealth,
were made in submissions from Ashleigh Leake and colleagues;33
Michael Duffy;34
the US Chamber Institute for Legal Reform;35 the Law Council of Australia;36
and IMF Bentham.37
2.30 The views expressed were not unanimous. Other submissions argued that
the existing powers of the Court are adequate to manage
the risks. Julie-Anne
Tarr cautioned against unnecessary regulation.38 Slater and Gordon maintained
that introducing substantial
capital adequacy requirements could create
regulatory burdens that would close off the market and reduce competition among
Litigation Funding Solutions also argued that a capital adequacy
requirement would not be conducive to a competitive market place:
The Funders who are based offshore have most of their assets overseas even
though they are heavily involved in Australian matters.
They hold little or no
capital here in Australia. Imposing a minimum capital requirement for litigation
funders to operate in Australia
could remove a large quantity of funding from
Australia. If this occurred, the access to justice would be adversely impacted
many people.40
2.31 The courts have responded to the challenges arising from the involvement
of litigation funders in individual proceedings, and
need to continue to do so,
but court procedures cannot, and should not, be seen as a substitute for
industry-wide regulation. The
Commission considers that industry-wide issues
require national responses, and the responsibility for regulating the litigation
industry rests squarely with the Commonwealth Government.
Review by Australian Law Reform Commission
2.32 On 15 December 2017, the Commonwealth Attorney-General referred to the
Law Reform Commission (ALRC), for report by 21 December 2018, consideration
whether, and to what extent, class action proceedings and third-party
litigation funders should be subject to Commonwealth regulation,
particular, whether there is adequate regulation of the following matters:
• conflicts of interest between lawyer and litigation funder;
• conflicts of interest between litigation funder and plaintiffs;
• prudential requirements, including minimum levels of capital;
• distribution of proceeds of litigation, including the desirability of
statutory caps on the proportion of settlements or damages
awards that may be
retained by lawyers and litigation funders;
• character requirements and fitness to be a litigation funder;
• the relationship between a litigation funder and a legal

• the costs charged by solicitors in funded litigation, including but
not limited to class action proceedings; and
• any other matters related to these Terms of Reference.41
2.33 The Attorney-General further asked the ALRC to consider what
changes, if any, should be made to Commonwealth legislation
to implement its
recommendations. The results of the inquiry will be awaited with interest. In
the meantime, this issue should not
be confined
to jurisdictions with class action regimes: it should be raised at the
national forum of the
Council of Australian Governments.
Recommendation
The Victorian Government should advocate through the Council of
Australian Governments for stronger national regulation and supervision
litigation funding industry.
Litigation funding in Victoria
Funded class actions
2.34 The growth of the litigation funding industry has had national
consequences for the management of class actions, but the impact
varies from one
research that the Victorian class action
regime ‘has not been particularly
attractive to litigation funders’.42
2.35 There have been 85 class actions filed in the Supreme Court of Victoria
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) commenced.43 Litigation
funders have funded only
10 of them; four of these were transferred to the Federal Court.44
2.36 Litigation funders are more active in the three other class action
As at 31 May 2017,
96 (82.7 per cent) of the 116 funded class actions ever filed in Australia were
brought in the Federal Court.45
The last Victorian class action supported by a
litigation funder was filed on 16 May 2016. Since then, more than 34 funded
actions have been filed in the Federal Court and in the Supreme Courts of
New South Wales and Queensland.46
2.37 Of the 10 funded class actions that have been filed in Victoria, six
were shareholder class actions47 and two were investor
class actions.48 The
predominance of funded class actions of this type in Victoria is consistent
with experience in other jurisdictions.

2.38 Only two other types of funded class action have been filed in Victoria.
The litigation funder in each case is based offshore:
• A class action, funded by Omni Bridgeway, where the holders of
abalone fishery licences alleged that the State of Victoria
and Southern Ocean
Mariculture negligently allowed the release of a herpes-like virus from an
abalone aquaculture farm operated by
Southern Ocean Mariculture to the wild
abalone population, causing loss and damage to the class members.49
• A claim by companies which manufacture, install and distribute home
insulation for loss and damages suffered because of the
early termination of the
Commonwealth Government’s national home insulation scheme. It is funded by
Harbour Litigation Funding.50
Other funded proceedings
2.39 It is not known how many other types of civil proceedings in Victoria
have involved litigation funders. The plaintiff’s
financial arrangements
and costs in these cases are
not subject to the same degree of court supervision and public scrutiny as
class actions. Generally, apart from class actions, commercial
funders support insolvency proceedings and commercial litigation with large
claims. It is reasonable to conclude that
they are involved in cases with these
characteristics in Victoria.
2.40 One funded case is reportedly a catalyst for this reference: a claim
made by trustees for former employees of Huon Corporation
Limited against CBL
Insurance Ltd51 (
Huon Corporation
). The trustees would have been unable
to proceed with the claim without the financial support of a litigation funder.
After a protracted
dispute between the parties,
the Supreme Court found in the trustees’ favour. The outcome attracted
public attention because the former employees on whose
behalf the litigation was
conducted ultimately received nothing from the amount awarded. The Commission
has received submissions
from the National Union of Workers and Litigation
Capital Management, who were directly involved in the case.
2.41 Clearly, although the outcome of
Huon Corporation
was a result of
particular circumstances, it illustrates the importance to funded plaintiffs
(and to anyone on whose behalf litigation
is conducted) of clear communication
from their legal representatives about the progress and costs of the
proceedings. Because of
the public interest in the case, as well as the insight
it provides into some of the issues arising from the terms of reference,
further discussed at [2.75] – [2.87].
Issues presented by litigation funding
2.42 The Commission has identified three core issues that have affected, or
could affect, the extent to which litigation funders make
access to justice
• case selection—the types of case selected for funding
• costs—the size of the funding fee and any other funding
• client interests—the juxtaposition of the commercial interests
of the funder and the interests of the plaintiff.
Regent Holdings v State of Victoria
[2013] VSC 601
(7 November
Roo Roofing Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia
Fitzgerald v CBL Insurance Ltd
[2014] VSC 493
(2 October 2014).
The view that this was the catalyst for the reference was reported in: Ben
Butler, ‘Victims Get Nothing as
Litigation Funder, Lawyers Share the
The Australian
22 August 2016; Sol Dolor, ‘Vic
Launches Review of Litigation Funder Rules’,
Australasian Lawyer
17 January 2017. It was repeated in Submission 14 (LCM).
2.43 These issues are inherent in the commercial nature of litigation
funding: litigation funders invest in litigation to make a profit.
They invest
in claims that are low risk and aim to maximise their returns. The cases they
select are confined to distinct areas of
commercial activity and their funding
fee is the largest single expense that a plaintiff pays. Although they have
supported claims
for altruistic reasons,52 it would be unsustainable for them to
give priority to public benefit over commercial considerations.
2.44 In addition, the entry of a participant who is not a party to
litigation, but has a financial stake in how it is conducted and
achieved, changes the dynamics of the proceeding. It introduces the risk of a
conflict of interest that could produce
an unfair process or outcome.
2.45 Disclosure obligations and cost controls for litigation funding are
discussed below against the background of these issues.
Case selection
2.46 Litigation funders invest in claims that have strong prospects of
recovering a significant financial return, and the selection
process has become
more sophisticated as the industry has matured. Broadly, litigation funders
consider the following criteria when
deciding whether or not to fund a
• the prospects of success
• the amount likely to be recovered if the claim is successful
• the costs and risks in prosecuting the claim
• the complexity of the claim
• the estimated time until the claim will be resolved
• whether there are risks in enforcing a favourable judgment, such as
the solvency of a defendant.53
2.47 The cases that tend to meet these criteria are high value, low-risk
commercial claims for damages or compensation, often involving
liquidators,
bankruptcy trustees, shareholders and investors. More recently, funders have
been investing in international arbitration
as well. Claims aimed at obtaining non-monetary results (such as an
injunction or declaration) are not funded, and nor are claims
that rely on
evidence which may give rise to a number of litigation risks, including claims
for personal injury or workers’
compensation, family law cases and
defamation cases.
2.48 Although there will be exceptions, a claim for less than $1 million is
unlikely to be funded by a commercial litigation funder.
The reasoning is
apparent from the following explanation by Litigation Funding Solutions:
It is important that the damages which are capable of being recovered justify
the cost of litigation. Legal claims often involve layers
of potential damages.
For a legal claim to be successful it must have a strong inner core of
Many claims can potentially be stretched to increase quantum. However,
generally speaking, the further you move from the centre of
a claim the more
risky and expensive the claim becomes to litigate. There are often much greater
costs involved to establish
‘outer boundary’ recovery levels. A funder looks for an action
that has a solid core. Once a funding decision is taken
the potential of greater
recovery becomes icing on the cake and can be used to pressure the defendant to
52 IMF Bentham Ltd submitted that it has provided pro bono assistance in
matters: ‘Although IMF is a for-profit company and
obligation to its shareholders, it has, for example, provided financial
assistance and adverse cost indemnities for individuals who
discrimination claims, such as racial and disability discrimination
claims.’: Submission 25.
53 Jason Betts, David Taylor and Christine Tran, ‘Litigation Funding
for Class Actions’ in Damian Grave and Helen Mould
Class Actions in Australia: 1992–2017
(Ross Parsons
Centre of Commercial, Corporate and Taxation Law, 2017) 205, 209.
As a rule of thumb, [the] ‘inner core’ quantum of a claim needs
to be $1,000,000 or more to warrant a funder’s interest
and make the cost
of funding justifiable for the claimant and its stakeholders. One reason for
this is that the cost and expenses
to run a $1,000,000 damages case often
involves comparable costs to cases for much bigger amounts.54
2.49 The minimum claim value for funding multi-party claims is generally
higher than for
single-party claims. IMF Bentham, for example, usually funds single-party
claims above $5 million in value, and multi-party claims
above $20 million in
value.55 Maurice Blackburn commented that it is almost impossible to secure
litigation funding for a class action
involving claims of less than $30
2.50 The practice of filtering out applications for funding that do not meet
stringent legal, process and commercial criteria removes
claims that do not have
merit (as well as those that do have merit but do not meet other criteria). For
example, IMF Bentham informed
the Productivity Commission that fewer than five
per cent of the applications it receives are funded.57 The diversion of
unmeritorious
claims allows the resources of the legal system to be allocated
more efficiently.
2.51 Careful selection processes are also likely to have contributed to the
success rate of funded proceedings, although data compiled
by Vince Morabito
direct correlation between funding
arrangements and results.
2.52 In the Federal Court, where most funded cases are filed, 79 per cent of
funded class actions have settled, compared to 43 per
cent of unfunded class
actions. In state jurisdictions, the settlement rate for funded class actions is
much lower than for unfunded
class actions. Only 30 per cent of funded class
actions in state jurisdictions have settled, compared to 70 per cent of unfunded
class actions.58
2.53 The results indicate that the involvement of a litigation funder does
not necessarily increase the prospects of a successful
outcome; nor does it
reduce them. The involvement of litigation funders in the legal system does not
cause an upsurge in speculative
and insubstantial claims.
2.54 Clearly, litigation funding creates opportunities for claimants to seek
compensation or damages for meritorious claims and supports
them usually to a
successful conclusion. The extent to which funders enable access to justice in
this way is determined by the criteria
they use for selecting the cases they
fund. The next two sections discuss, in turn, the significance for class action
and other litigation.
Funded class actions
2.55 Most revenue generated by the litigation funding industry is derived
from class actions, particularly shareholder class actions.59
The first class
action in Australia—and the world— to involve a litigation funder
was in 2001.60 By 31 May 2017, 116
funded class actions had been filed across
all jurisdictions. Of these, 74 (63 per cent) were filed after 1 June

2.56 A relatively narrow variety of class actions attract the most
attention of litigation funders, reflecting the focus on low-risk
claims that
are likely to generate a return on the funder’s investment. The range is
shown in Table 1.

2.57 Australia has robust mandatory continuous disclosure rules for
ASX-listed companies, comprehensive prohibitions on misleading
and deceptive
conduct, and a high rate
of share ownership.64 A failure to comply with these laws affects a large
number of people in similar situations, and class actions
are an inherently
suitable means of seeking damages or compensation for broad-based harm.
Litigation in these areas of the law presents
a sound investment opportunity for
litigation funders, as explained by John Walker, Suzanna Khouri and Wayne
Attrill when working
for IMF (Australia) Ltd in 2009:
The statutory causes of action provided in the continuous disclosure, product
liability and anti-cartel legislative regimes are generally
straight-forward to establish than the equivalent actions at common law and, in
the context of shareholder non-disclosure claims
in particular, are determined
in large part on publicly-available evidence, including documents filed with the
Australian Securities
Exchange.65
2.58 Seventy-one per cent of all shareholder class actions filed in Australia
on or before
31 May 2017 were supported by litigation funders.66 However, as IMF Bentham
submitted, litigation funders have funded many types
of class action besides
shareholder and investor cases.67
2.59 Nevertheless, none of the 87 non-investor class actions that had been
filed nationally for the benefit of vulnerable people as
at March 2014 were
financed by litigation funders.68
Legal services in these cases were usually provided on a ‘no win, no
fee’ basis, although some proceeded only with the
support of government
agencies or the community or because the lawyers were prepared to work without

2.60 The largest class actions conducted under the Victorian class action
regime have been underwritten by law firms acting on a ‘no
fee’ basis.70
Other funded proceedings
2.61 Commercial litigation funding began as a source of finance for
insolvency proceedings.
Claims arising out of insolvent companies about preferences, insolvent
trading, and other claims brought by liquidators continue to
be an important
area of activity for funders.
2.62 Litigation funding has expanded into proceedings in other areas of law,
notably commercial claims about breach of contract, misrepresentation
negligence. Funding is also commercially available for intellectual property
and estates matters. Proceedings that involve a
major litigation funder are
likely to be large claims as they are more economic to run.
2.63 Although the commercial funding of claims valued at less than $1 million
is generally not viable for litigation funders, the
number of litigation funders
is growing. A funder observed during informal consultations that newer entrants
are focusing on claims
valued at less than $5 million. In addition, litigation
funders are offering an increasing variety
of products, such as limited funding only for adverse costs or disbursements,
may be more viable than providing full funding services for smaller claims.
IMF Bentham gave, as an example, a funding solution called
‘Cost-certain
access to business litigation’, offered by a firm that provides services
to small-to-medium-sized businesses.
this arrangement, for claims over $500,000, a ‘no win, no fee’
fee agreement can be combined with litigation funding.71
2.64 The access to justice that litigation funding provides is necessarily
determined by the commercial nature of the activity. It
is reasonable to expect
that litigation funders will continue to expand the market for their services.
It is also inevitable that
some meritorious claims will not be funded
if—because of the value of the claim, the complexity of the matter, the
of success or other factors caught by the selection
criteria—they will not generate an adequate return on the funder’s
investment.
2.65 Measures to generate financial support for meritorious class actions
that are not perceived as commercially viable by litigation
funders, or law
firms operating on a ‘no win, no fee’ basis, are discussed in
Chapters 3 and 5.
Components of funding costs
2.66 Litigation funders reduce the cost barrier of litigation for plaintiffs
by underwriting the cost of bringing proceedings and
indemnifying them against
adverse costs. They monitor and influence the legal costs to different degrees,
and some may charge a project
management fee for doing so, but they do not
determine the lawyer’s share of any recovered amount. The terms on which
the funding

2.68 If the plaintiff wins, the litigation funder’s costs are deducted
from the amount awarded by the court or negotiated between
the parties. These
typically include:
• a funding fee, expressed as a percentage of the settlement or
judgment amount
• reimbursement of the legal costs and disbursements that the
litigation funder paid during the proceeding (less any contribution
defendant in the form of adverse costs)
• court fees
• a project management fee, calculated as a percentage of the legal
costs, for monitoring the progress of the litigation and
managing the associated
legal costs and disbursements.72
2.69 The amount of the funding fee is determined by the structure of the
funding agreement, which varies in nearly every case. This
was pointed out by
Justice Murphy in
Earglow Pty Ltd v Newcrest Mining Ltd
It should be kept in mind that it is not enough to consider the funding
rate on a stand-alone basis. The funding arrangements reached may be
structured in a variety of ways which can affect the costs and
risk taken on by
the funder and therefore affect the reasonableness of the funding commission
rate. For example, a funder might agree:
(a) to provide funding to cover adverse costs but not to meet the
applicant’s legal costs and disbursements, with the case
being conducted
by the applicant’s solicitors on a conditional fee basis to be paid by
class members from any settlement conditional
on success;
(b) to pay disbursements only, with the case being conducted by the
applicant’s solicitors on a conditional fee basis;
(c) to only pay costs and disbursements up to a fixed cap or to pay a fixed
percentage of the costs and disbursements, with the remainder
left to the
applicant’s solicitors to be paid by class members conditional on success;
(d) to cover the risk of adverse costs liability through After the Event
Insurance with the premium to be paid by class members from
the settlement sum
upon success.74
2.70 The percentage of the recovered amount that litigation funders charge in
return for their services varies. The typical range
appears to be between 20 and
45 per cent.75 In federal class actions, the average proportion left for
distribution to class members
has been found to be approximately 58 per cent.76
The funding fee is usually the largest single deduction.77
Funding fees in Victoria
2.71 Unlike legal fees, which are based on the amount of work done and are
subject to regulation and review, the funding fee reflects
the litigation
funder’s assessment of the risk, its own costs and its profit margins. The
examples discussed below show that
the funder’s share of the recovered
amount can be much less than, similar to or greater than the share allocated to
legal costs
and disbursements. They also show that, while engaging a funder
enables the proceedings to be conducted, it does not guarantee that
whom they are conducted will receive a share of the proceeds.
72 The Commission was told, anecdotally, that litigation funders have charged
project management fees in class actions in the past
but they are less likely to
be charged in recent proceedings.

Funded class actions
2.72 The Supreme Court of Victoria has reviewed the settlement agreements of
four class actions involving a litigation funder.
Pathway Investments Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Limited
a shareholder class action funded by International Litigation Funding Partners
Pte Ltd. The settlement amount was $115 million,
including interest and costs.
Class members received
just over 57 per cent ($65.55 million) plus interest; legal costs and
disbursements were 10.4 per cent ($11.9 million). The litigation
funder received
40 per cent of the proceeds of class members who held fewer than one million
shares; 35 per cent if they held between
one million and ten million shares; and
30 per cent if they held more than 10 million shares.78
Bolitho v Banksia Securities Limited
, an investor class
action. In a partial settlement, approved in August 2016, the settling
defendants paid $5.2 million. Class members
were entitled to approximately 34.5
per cent of this amount, minus half of the fees payable for a contradictor who
was appointed
by the Court to review the settlement agreement. Legal costs and
disbursements accounted for 49 per cent ($2.55 million) and the
funder, BSL Litigation Partners Limited, received about 16.5 per cent
($858,000).79
• In a further partial settlement, approved in January 2018, the
settling defendants paid $64 million. Of this amount, approximately
cent ($44.62 million) was distributed to class members, and 8.2 per cent ($5.225
million) was directed to legal costs and
disbursements. The litigation funders
received 22 per cent ($14.08 million).80
Regent Holdings v State of Victoria and Southern Ocean
Mariculture
, a class action brought on behalf of 88 holders of abalone
fishery access licences. The action
was not successful against the first defendant, the State of Victoria.81 The
second defendant, Southern Ocean Mariculture, had previously
settled and $2.57
of the proceeds were paid towards the State of Victoria’s costs. The
class members received no monetary compensation from the
settlement. The lawyers
off substantial professional fees. The litigation funder, Omni Bridgeway,
received undisclosed payments from the settlement but did
not recover the costs
it had incurred or compensation for its involvement.82
Camping Warehouse v Downer EDI
, a shareholder class action
that settled for $8.25 million plus legal costs of $2.85 million, a total of
$11.1 million. The class
members received 88 per cent of the settlement fund
($7.25 million), or about 63 per cent
of the total. The litigation funder, BSL Litigation Partners Limited,
received 10 per cent of the settlement fund ($825,000), less
than 8 per cent of
the total paid by the defendants.83

Other funded proceedings
2.73 Publicly available information about the amounts received by litigation
funders in other proceedings is harder to find. Funding
for these proceedings
can be obtained from a wider range of sources and the question of whether a
litigation funder is involved
may not be raised during court proceedings at
all. Even where the court is aware that a commercial funding arrangement is in
the terms may be kept confidential. Funding agreements with litigation
funders who invest directly into litigation portfolios, rather
than individual
cases, would be even more opaque.
2.74 Nevertheless, the existence of a funding arrangement is most
likely to be revealed where litigation funders have been most
active: insolvency
proceedings. Under
section 477(2B)
Corporations Act 2001
before entering a long-term agreement on the
company’s behalf, a liquidator must seek court approval, or the
approval of the committee of inspection or the majority of creditors.
litigation funding agreements were unlikely to have been contemplated when the
section was drafted, liquidators seeking
to enter them to conduct insolvency proceedings and meet any obligations to
provide security for costs commonly apply to the court
for approval under this
provision. The funding fee in insolvency cases can exceed 50 per cent, and has
been as high as 75 per cent.84
The Huon Corporation case
2.75 As noted above, the outcome of the
Huon Corporation
attracted public attention when the company’s former employees, on whose
behalf the litigation was conducted, received
none of the payments ordered by
the court. Safeguards that exist in insolvency proceedings and class actions did
not apply in this
2.76 The claim was for payment under a financial insurance policy for a
shortfall in employee entitlements when Huon Corporation become
insolvent in
2006. The policy, procured from New Zealand insurer CBL Insurance Ltd, named two
trustees for the employees as
‘the insured’.
2.77 The trustees commenced legal action against CBL Insurance, ultimately on
behalf of 336 former employees, in October 2011. The
trial concluded in October
2013, and judgment was handed down in October 2014. Final orders were made in
May 2015. The defendant
filed an appeal but, before it was heard, the claims
were resolved and finally discontinued in February 2016.
2.78 The amount received from CBL Insurance was $5,107,259, comprising:
• $4,132,232 as the principal sum, based on employee entitlements
• $500,027 in interest
• $475,000 as a contribution to the plaintiff’s costs.86

2.80 Discussion about
Huon Corporation
in submissions and
consultations raised two areas of concern: the cost of the proceedings and the
distribution of the recovered amount.
2.81 The cost of the proceedings was clearly disproportionate to the size of
Excluding the litigation funding fee, it was $3,259,000. According to the
trustees, the initial legal costs estimates were ‘hopelessly
inadequate’ because of the long trial time
and legal process and disputes.88 The litigation was conducted over almost
five years and,
‘from the beginning, CBL maintained an obtuse approach in dealing with
the trustees’
demands and subsequent litigation’.89
2.82 The delays and disruptions to the proceedings were caused by both
parties, causing the Court to note that: ‘With the
benefit of hindsight,
it is clear that both parties could have conducted this litigation in a more
efficient way.’90 The Court
concluded that, in order to do justice between
the parties, it was not appropriate to apply the usual rule as to costs.
CBL Insurance was ordered to pay only 70 per cent of the
plaintiff’s costs of the proceeding.91
2.83 In its submission, LCM stressed that it did not control the costs of the
proceeding:
it is not LCM’s role, nor is it properly LCM’s prerogative, to
assume a plaintiff’s right and responsibility to
conduct the
plaintiff’s proceedings, instruct its legal representatives and, by
extension, drive and regulate the quantum of
incurred legal costs or adverse
It is, however, LCM’s role to continue to make payment of the legal
costs that eventuate and to bear the full risk of the action.
It is important to
note that had the Huon Corporation action (and the same can be said for most
funded actions) resolved for less
than its ultimate outcome, or had the
defendant been successful at first instance or on appeal, it is LCM who would
have been liable
to make payment of the full sum of the plaintiff’s legal
costs and, in addition, to meet the very considerable burden of adverse

(1 May 2015)
[43] (Sloss J).
91 Ibid [44] (Sloss J).
92 Submission 14 (LCM).
2.84 The involvement of the litigation funder is at the heart of the second
issue: how the recovered amount was distributed. As required
by the funding
agreement, LCM met the costs of the proceedings and was reimbursed from the
proceeds. It was then entitled to its
funding fee, for which it received about
36 per cent of the recovered amount. This is within the range that litigation
funders are
commonly paid and reportedly less than the full amount to which LCM
was entitled under the agreement.93
2.85 The decision by the trustees to use the services of a litigation funder
was not an easy one.
They felt they had no option but to approach third parties for funding after
extensive discussions with the liquidator failed to reach
agreement. After the
outcome of the litigation was known, the trustees initiated a dispute with the
litigation funder to force a
dividend for the employees. They later abandoned it
on legal advice.94
2.86 The National Union of Workers described the experience of the former
Huon Corporation employees as ‘one of complete despair’:95
We believe that this is not a good public policy outcome. Those who were
clearly wronged decided to prosecute their claim in spite
of all of the various
tactical legal barriers put before them and won an outcome that should have
meant a disbursement to them after
11 years. Our Victorian system of justice
however did not produce this outcome. It is clear to us that some form of market
needs to occur to prevent this result from occurring again.96
2.87 Because of the lack of data about how many funded proceedings, other
than class actions and insolvency cases, are likely to be
conducted for
disputants who are unaware of the involvement and cost of the litigation funder,
it is difficult to gauge the scale
of the problem encountered by the former Huon
employees. Nevertheless, there is scope for
reform to ensure that the court knows that a litigation funder is involved
and the terms of its involvement. Recommendations for
reform are discussed later
in this chapter.
Client interests
2.88 In the consultation paper, the Commission discussed the tripartite
relationship between the litigation funder, lawyer and plaintiff
conflicts of interest within this relationship.97 The tripartite model is a
useful means of identifying, conceptually, how
conflicts of interest may affect
decision making at various stages of proceedings, though in practice the way in
which the parties
interact and their relative influence vary.
2.89 Factors such as the size and type of proceeding, how the funder and
lawyers approach their roles, and whether there is a pre-existing
relationship
between any of the parties
will affect the way in which they interact. In class actions, there are
additional distinctions between the representative plaintiff
and other class
members; between class members who are clients of the lawyers and those who are
not; between class members who have
entered a funding agreement with the
litigation funder and those who have not.
2.90 The discussion below only concerns conflicts of interest for litigation
funders. Conflicts of interest for lawyers in both funded
and unfunded class
actions are discussed in Chapter 4.
93 Submission 16 (National Union of Workers).
97 Victorian Law Reform Commission,
Justice—Litigation Funding and Group Proceedings
, Consultation Paper
(2017) 44–9.
Conflict of interest for litigation funders
2.91 Because litigation funders seek to profit from the litigation in which
they invest, there is recurring debate about the priority
given to the
funder’s commercial interests over the plaintiff’s interests. The
debate has three broad themes:
• the risk that the litigation funder will fail to meet its obligations
under the funding agreement
• the risk of abuse of process, where the process of the court is used
for an improper purpose
• the risk that the litigation funder will exercise influence over the
conduct of proceedings to the plaintiff’s detriment.
2.92 These themes are expressed as ‘risks’ because they arise
from the inherent conflicts of interest between the funder
and the plaintiff.
The Commission has been told about a small number of cases that have been
clouded by conflicts of interest, but
acknowledges that there is little
empirical evidence that conflicts of interest are producing unfair outcomes.
This does not mean
that the risks are hypothetical or exaggerated. They
have long been recognised, as evident in the old torts and offences of
maintenance and champerty.
2.93 The low incidence of reported problems may indicate that the risks are
being well managed under existing laws, as submitted by
Slater and Gordon:
the vast majority of lawyers and funders involved in litigation of this
nature take their obligations under the relevant legislative
extremely seriously. This includes compliance with professional obligations,
disclosure requirements, and statutory overarching
obligations, combined with
the recognition that courts rightly take a great interest in ensuring compliance
with same.98
2.94 The Commission also notes that the litigation funder’s commercial
interests do not inevitably conflict with the plaintiff’s
interests. IMF
Bentham, which actively supervises the litigation in which it invests, pointed
out that they may align:
In funded proceedings some of the potential conflicts are mitigated by the
involvement of the funder. For example, IMF’s objectives
are closely
aligned with those of the class members that it funds: namely to achieve the
just, quick, inexpensive and efficient resolution
of claims through appropriate
use of the civil justice system and for the largest settlement or damages award
possible having regard
to the risks of the litigation. The funder’s
involvement provides an important check and ensures there is oversight of the
costs of the litigation which is for the benefit of all class members. The
funder brings a commercial approach to the conduct and
resolution of class
actions that aligns closely with the interests of class members.99
Funding agreement obligations
2.95 In the absence of stronger national regulation of the industry,
there is a risk that a funder will avoid meeting its obligations
to indemnify
the plaintiff for the cost of the proceeding and any adverse costs.
2.96 Concern about this risk is evident in calls for the introduction of
capital adequacy requirements in conjunction with more robust
regulation, and the Commission recommends above that the Victorian Government
advocate for stronger supervision and regulation
of the industry nationally.
98 Submission 28 (Slater and Gordon Lawyers).
99 Submission 25 (IMF Bentham Ltd).
Abuse of process
2.97 While upholding an arrangement that gave the funder significant control
conduct of the proceedings in
, the High Court recognised that
this level of influence could corrupt court processes. It considered that the
court could rely on
its inherent powers to address any problems.
2.98 All courts have inherent powers to take any steps that are necessary to
prevent abuse of process and ensure a fair trial. If
a proceeding is brought
for an improper purpose, a stay may be the appropriate remedy. However, the
power to stay a proceeding
is used only in exceptional circumstances.100 Where
there is an unacceptable legal or commercial relationship between the lawyers
and the litigation funder, the court is likely to use its inherent jurisdiction
to restrain the lawyers from acting to ensure due
administration of justice and
to protect the integrity of the judicial process.101
2.99 The Commission notes that the Court would be supported in its role if it
were always made aware when a litigation funder is involved
in a proceeding.
Recommendations concerning disclosure are discussed later in this
chapter.102
Excessive influence
2.100 Although the litigation funder and plaintiff are parties to a
funding agreement they have little, if any, direct contact.
Whether supervising
and making day-to-day decisions about the proceedings, or taking a less active
role, litigation funders work
with the lawyers, not the plaintiffs.
2.101 There is a risk that the litigation funder’s influence over the
conduct of the litigation will subordinate the plaintiff’s
interests to
the funder’s interests. However, it is common for funding agreements to
specify that, if there is a disagreement,
the lawyer’s and
plaintiff’s view will prevail over that of the litigation funder.103
2.102 The High Court’s decision in
established the right
of a funder to exercise influence and some degree of control over the day-to-day
conduct of a funded action.
The point at which the control is excessive is not
clear, including to litigation funders who have expressed difficulty in seeing
where their interests could conflict with those of the plaintiff. IMF Bentham
said in its submission:
it is difficult to see how claimants’ interests could be detrimentally
affected by a funder recommending that only the most
promising causes of action
are run in the interest
of minimising the costs and risks of the proceedings and maximising the
potential outcome.104
2.103 Decisions at settlement have raised the greatest concerns. In their
submission, Ashleigh Leake, Josephine Vernon and Bruce Efron
described how
conflicts of interest could produce unfair outcomes if not managed:
As a purely financially-driven party, litigation funders comparatively
perceive the
‘best settlement’ as one with the greatest return and the least
expense. In seeking to achieve this goal, a litigation
funder will be more
inclined to aggressively seek return on investment over legal justice. The
nature of these commercial interests
can result in striving for awards that have
greater commercial benefit with the sacrifice of integrity,
as the dignity lost is not necessarily their own but the class
members’. Litigation funders are more inclined to settle out
of court if
the settlement offer exceeds the perceived commercial award of the court; this
does not always guarantee a conclusion
in the best

give priority to the plaintiff’s instructions over those of the funder:

interest of the class members. Inclination for settlement can be increased if
the litigation funder perceives the expenses (eg Court
costs, solicitor’s
fees, etc.) to be approaching their maximum limit of expenses budgeted for;
similarly, if they perceive
the proceedings to be ‘drawn out’,
litigation funders are inclined to settle.105
Regulation of litigation funders’ conduct
2.104 It has been often observed that, unlike lawyers, litigation funders are
not officers of
the court, nor are they subject to the same ethical obligations.106 While it
is possible for a fiduciary relationship to arise from
the funding arrangement,
in class actions, most funding agreements seek to contractually exclude any
fiduciary duties arising between
the funder and class members.107
2.105 However, obligations to the court have been imposed on litigation
funders under the
Civil Procedure Act 2010
(Vic) and ASIC has issued a
regulatory guide on how litigation funders should manage conflicts of
Civil Procedure Act 2010
Civil Procedure Act
specifies a range of ethical and procedural
obligations, known as the ‘overarching obligations’, which apply to
participants
in litigation, including litigation funders.108
2.107 There are 10 overarching obligations, which require participants
• act honestly
• only make claims that have a proper basis
• only take steps to resolve or determine the dispute
• cooperate in the conduct of the civil proceeding
• not mislead or deceive
• use reasonable endeavours to resolve the dispute
• narrow the issues in dispute
• ensure costs are reasonable and proportionate
• minimise delay
• disclose the existence of documents critical to the resolution of the
dispute.109
2.108 The US Chamber Institute for Legal Reform proposed that litigation
funders have a statutory obligation to comply with their
overarching obligations
and be held to account should they fail to do so, and ‘At the very least,
they should be obliged to
certify to the Court that they have complied with
those obligations when funded proceedings are commenced’.110
2.109 The Commission considers that the existing obligations are clear and
that the Court has adequate powers to address problems
that may arise during
proceedings as a result of
a participant’s failure to comply. The Court has broad discretion to
impose a costs order or other sanction on a person who
contravenes an
overarching obligation. If satisfied that a breach has occurred, the court may
make ‘any order it considers
appropriate
in the interests of justice’.111 Judges of the Supreme Court told the
Commission that the codification of the overarching obligations
useful means of conveying expected standards of behaviour.112

ASIC conflict of interest regulatory guide
2.110 As noted at [2.23], litigation funders are not required to hold an
Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) as long as they
have adequate
practices in place to manage conflicts of interest.113 ASIC has issued a
regulatory guide which sets out ASIC’s
expectations for compliance with
the obligation to maintain adequate practices and follow certain procedures for
managing conflicts
of interest.114
2.111 The guide is comprehensive and aligns with the standards required of
AFSL holders. It states that litigation funders should
have written procedures
for dealing with a range of situations in which conflicts of interest can
arise.115 Any conflicts of interest
should be disclosed prior to entry into a
funding agreement so that prospective plaintiffs can make an informed decision
a conflict may affect the service being provided to them.116 In
addition, the funding agreement should disclose the terms of the
between the funder and the lawyer.117
2.112 Disclosure about conflicts of interest should be ‘timely,
prominent, specific and meaningful’118 and ongoing throughout
of the litigation scheme.119 The method of disclosure (either paper or
electronic) may differ according to the method
that best suits the members of
the scheme.120
2.113 The level of compliance monitoring to date has contributed to concern
that there is no effective oversight of industry practices
or prevention of
unethical conduct.
2.114 A number of submissions suggested that the potential for conflicts of
interest could be reduced by stronger regulation of conduct.
Proposals included
the following:
• A legal practitioner or class action law firm could be prohibited
from directly or indirectly holding any share or other ownership
litigation funder or class representative involved in the proceeding. The
regulation would be similar to regulation recently
introduced in Singapore and
Hong Kong in relation to litigation funding of arbitration proceedings.121
• Litigation funders could have a fiduciary duty to their client
imposed on them, on the basis that they tend to deny such a
relationship exists
and exclude the possibility by contract.122
• Litigation funders could be subject to a statutory duty of good faith
in the same manner as insurers are under
sections 13
Insurance Contracts Act 1984
(Cth). It would not be possible to contract
out of the statutory duty. Unlike a fiduciary duty, the statutory duty would not
the funder to prefer their client’s interests over its own
interests; rather, it would require the funder to have regard to
the interests
of both parties.123
• Costs agreements and funding agreements could include provisions for
managing conflicts of interest and state that plaintiff
lawyers have a
continuing obligation to manage potential conflicts of interest.124
2.115 Consistent with its view that national regulation of the litigation
funding industry is necessary, the Commission considers
that the imposition of
any stronger rules to prevent or manage conflicts of interest for litigation
funders should be under Commonwealth
Corporations Act 2001

2.116 Within Victoria, the Commission does not consider that the Supreme
Court of Victoria requires additional statutory powers to
enforce compliance
with the overarching obligations in the
Civil Procedure Act
. Where instances of
unethical conduct have arisen in funded litigation, the Court has exercised its
inherent powers to stay the proceedings.125
2.117 On a case-by-case basis, the risk arising from conflicts of interest is
usually managed through disclosure to the client of
the fact that the conflict
exists, and how it is being mitigated. The lack of transparency about the
relationship between litigation
funders and the lawyers has led to calls for
stronger disclosure requirements, as indicated by the terms of reference.
2.118 By increasing transparency, accountability improves. The client is
better informed about the conditions under which the funding
is provided and
the implications for the way
the litigation is conducted. The court is better able to identify any impact
that a conflict of interest may be having on the proceedings
and the terms of
any settlement. In her submission, Vicki Waye drew attention to the importance
of disclosure in enabling the court
to ensure that justice is done:
The capacity of the courts to bring flexibility and nuance to their
supervisory or oversight role in an individual case (including
supervising
funding terms generally and confirming capital adequacy) is contingent upon
full information provided as early as
possible.126
2.119 Proposals to improve disclosure about funding arrangements to clients
and the court are discussed at [2.140] – [2.208].
Reform proposals
2.120 The terms of reference ask the Commission to report on whether there is
scope for the supervisory powers of Victorian courts
or Victorian regulatory
bodies to be increased in respect of proceedings funded by litigation funders.
Three possible reforms are
• placing limits on funding fees, or requiring them to be subject to an
approval process
• imposing clearer disclosure requirements on litigation funders and
lawyers to advise plaintiffs about the progress, costs
and possible outcomes of
proceedings supported by litigation funders
• requiring disclosure of funding arrangements in proceedings supported
by litigation funders.
2.121 These proposals are directed at protecting the plaintiff’s
interests, by controlling the amount of the funding fee and
transparency about the proceedings and the terms on which the litigation funder
is providing financial support. The US
Chamber Institute for Legal Reform has
argued that any solution must address all funded proceedings because the same
funding issues
arise in every type of proceeding in which a litigation funder is
involved.127 The Commission agrees that the litigation funding
industry should
be regulated nationally, but the protective measures suggested in the terms of
reference would not be necessary in
every funded case.
2.122 In the large commercial cases that litigation funders often finance,
the plaintiff is likely to have a sophisticated understanding
of contractual
obligations and financial undertakings, and direct access to legal advice in
entering the funding agreement. Plaintiffs
in this category can be expected to
have the resources and bargaining power to look after their interests without
further protection.
125 See, eg,
Walsh v WorleyParsons Limited (No 4)
[2017] VSC 292
May 2017) (Cameron J).
126 Submission 3 (Professor Julie-Anne Tarr).
127 Submission 19 (US Chamber Institute for Legal Reform).
2.123 Similarly, additional measures appear unnecessary to safeguard the
interests of plaintiffs who have less experience and influence
but instruct the
lawyers who are conducting the litigation and directly participate in funded
proceedings. Plaintiffs in this category
not at a discernible disadvantage compared to plaintiffs who receive
financial support by other means, such as a bank loan or private
agreement. Their lawyers have a fiduciary duty to act in their interests and can
advise them about funding options, the conditions
under which any financial
support is provided, and the progress of the litigation.
2.124 The need for greater protection is more likely to arise when funded
litigation is conducted by an intermediary on behalf of
multiple disputants. In
these cases, the ultimate recipients of any recovered amount may not be clients
of either the litigation
funder or the lawyer and may not know about or
understand the funding agreement. They may be relying on the intermediary to
that their interests are taken into account during proceedings or
settlement negotiations.
2.125 The imbalances of information and power in litigation of this type have
been recognised in class actions and insolvency proceedings,
where the court has
a particular role in protecting the interests of people who are not parties to
the litigation but are affected
by the outcome. However, safeguards that apply
in these proceedings did not apply in
Huon Corporation
2.126 For these reasons, the discussion in this chapter about the reforms
suggested by the terms of reference concerns funded litigation
that is conducted
by an intermediary on behalf of multiple disputants, including class actions,
rather than all litigation in which
a funder may be involved.
Regulation of funding fees
2.127 Courts, litigation funders and lawyers frequently observe that, if not
for the financial support of a litigation funder, the
plaintiff would have been
unable to bring the proceedings at all. The point was made by LCM when
commenting on
Huon Corporation:
It is an unfortunate reality that commercial litigation is unpredictable and
risky, and that the cost of advancing a claim, particularly
adversarial defendant, can have a very significant impact on the action’s
ultimate proceeds. This is true of both
funded and unfunded proceedings.
However, LCM submits that the services of a litigation funder allow the rights
of a litigant to
be enforced with that litigant facing no risk or cost, while
retaining the majority of the interest in any net upside.128
2.128 Similar sentiments were expressed in a recent decision by the Supreme
Court of New
South Wales approving a litigation funding agreement to fund insolvency
proceedings:
Even if the funder receives more than 50 per cent of any judgment, 40 per
cent of such if any judgment as might be obtained is a better
result for the
company’s creditors than nothing. Because of the terms of the funding
agreement, there is no downside for creditors
in the prosecution of the
litigation in question. There is no risk of the liquidators or creditors having
to bear an adverse costs
order, as it will be borne by the funder. In those
circumstances, it does not take extensive reasoning or explanation to realise
that there is benefit for the company in funding this litigation to an end.
That benefit—of an agreeing to an arrangement that will permit the
litigation to be funded to an end—is that the company
may get 50 (or some
lesser percentage) of something, for distribution amongst creditors; against the
position that there will plainly
be nothing if the litigation is not funded and
does not proceed. Against that potential benefit, no downside or detriment to
company from protracting an administration that would otherwise generate
nothing for creditors has been identified.129

2.129 Observations such as these do not necessarily mean that, even if the
litigation would not have proceeded but for the financial
support of the funder,
the court will always consider the funding fee to be reasonable. This is
particularly evident in class actions,
and the court’s approach to the
assessment of funding fees in class actions is discussed in detail in Chapter
2.130 The scope for limits to be placed on, or approval processes required
for, funding fees in proceedings other than class actions
is discussed
Limits on funding fees
2.131 In class actions, the court has a crucial role in supervising the
proceedings. It fixes the
date by which class members may opt out; it approves the formal notices that
are sent to them; and its approval is required before
a proposed settlement can
have legal effect.130
The settlement approval process ensures that the court considers whether the
settlement is fair and reasonable as between the parties
and in the interests
of class members as a whole. It also provides class members with the opportunity
to object.131
2.132 Should the court determine that the litigation funding fee, as set out
in the funding agreement, is not fair and reasonable,
it may refuse a
settlement. Although the possibility has not been considered in decisions of the
Supreme Court, the Federal Court
has indicated that, in certain circumstances,
it may modify the fee as part of settlement approval. In Chapter 5, the
recommends that the Supreme Court be given specific power to review
and vary all legal costs, litigation funding fees and charges,
and settlement
distribution costs in class actions, to ensure that they are fair and
reasonable.
2.133 The Supreme Court also considers the funder’s remuneration in
insolvency proceedings, if the liquidator seeking to enter
the funding agreement
asks the court for approval.132
When considering an application for approval, the size of the funding fee is
a relevant consideration and the court will ensure that
the funder is not given
a ‘grossly excessive profit’.133 However, the court generally will
not interfere with the liquidator’s
commercial judgment in seeking to
enter the agreement unless there is error of law or principle
or grounds for suspecting bad faith. Court approval is not an endorsement of
the agreement, but merely permission for the liquidator
to exercise their own
commercial judgment.134
2.134 The National Union of Workers proposed that the court be given the
power to vary the litigation funder’s remuneration
in funded proceedings
other than class actions by adjusting the distribution of the judgment amount.
It suggested that the court
could use a formula that would ensure that the
disputants on whose behalf the litigation was
conducted would receive a share. This would have enabled the former employees
Corporation
to receive a dividend.135
2.135 It is possible that, had Huon Corporation been conducted as a class
action, the outcome for the former employees would have
been better. The class
action procedure, and the court’s supervisory role and associated powers,
are designed to provide for
the interests of all class members to be taken into
account even though they are not parties to the proceedings. Unlike other
conducted on behalf of others, the outcome of
class actions directly affects the rights of all class members unless they
opt out of the proceedings, including those who were unaware
they had commenced.
For this reason, the court has more onerous responsibilities than in other civil
litigation. This is seen not
only in the formal exercise of its power but in
case management practices throughout the proceedings.

2.136 Moreover, in class actions, the representative plaintiff is not
appointed by the class members; nor are they an intermediary
or an agent of the
class members. In contrast, in other litigation where a party to the proceeding
participates on behalf of other
people, it is reasonable to expect there to be
communication between them, and with the lawyer, about the progress of the
and issues in dispute. The relationship in these cases between the
lawyer, the client, and anyone on whose behalf the litigation
is brought, does
not, of itself, require the court to intervene in the arrangements they make.
This includes arrangements with a
litigation funder established by a funding
agreement that the parties entered freely and with independent legal advice.
2.137 In the absence of an inherent need to do so, the Commission considers
that the court’s powers to vary funding fees and
associated costs should
not be extended beyond
the context of class actions. The court has extensive capacity, within the
boundaries of its traditional role, to respond to issues
that may arise during
the course of funded proceedings that unfairly affect any person connected with
the litigation.136 For example,
Civil Procedure Act
requires litigation
funders—and lawyers—to ensure that costs are reasonable and
proportionate,137 and provides the court
with broad discretion to impose
a costs order or other sanction in the event that this obligation is not
met.138 The court’s power in relation to costs has
been extended to
litigation funders where the interests of justice allow a departure from the
general rule that only parties to proceedings
may be subject to costs
2.138 A further consideration is the impact on the viability of the industry
if the court were empowered to vary funding fees generally,
rather than only in
class actions where it has a protective role. It would undermine the basis on
which commercial decisions to invest
in litigation are made if funders were
unable to rely on their contractual rights. The National Union of Workers has
suggested that
the market would adapt to any such reform, but
the Commission is concerned that the response would reduce the availability
of funding for litigation and the access to justice that
it enables. If the
reform were confined to proceedings in Victoria, it would create a disincentive
for litigation funders to invest
in proceedings within this jurisdiction.
2.139 The Commission’s conclusion that it is unnecessary to extend the
court’s powers in this way is predicated on the
condition that all
affected parties, and the court, know that the litigation is funded and are
aware of the terms of the funding
Corporation
illustrates that this is not always so, and why stronger
disclosure requirements should be introduced. Proposals to improve disclosure
practices are discussed below.
Disclosure to the court
2.140 The terms of reference raise the question of whether there should be an
obligation to disclose funding arrangements not only
in funded class actions but
also in other funded proceedings—and, if so, which proceedings.
2.141 In its report on the civil justice system, released in 2008, the
Commission recommended that parties to civil litigation be
required to disclose
the identity of an insurer or litigation funder that exercises control or
influence over the insured or assisted
party in the course of civil proceedings.
The recommendation flowed from the requirement that insurers and funders comply
overarching obligations, which are now contained in the Civil Procedure
Act.140 The Commission further recommended that the court
have discretion
to order disclosure of a party’s insurance policy or funding
arrangement if appropriate.141

Civil Justice Review
Report No 14 (2008) 471–2, 476; Recommendation 86.
These recommendations were not implemented.142
2.142 While the Court does not have a specific power to require disclosure of
litigation funding arrangements, it has a broad case
management power to give
any direction or make any order it considers appropriate in the interests of the
administration of justice
or in the public interest.143 In class actions, it
also has a general power to make any order it thinks necessary or appropriate
ensure that justice is done in the proceeding.144
Disclosure that a litigation funder is involved
2.143 The court may not be aware when a litigation funder has an interest in
the proceedings. It is not apparent, for example, that
the Court knew that a
litigation funder was involved in
Huon Corporation
. In the judgment
handed down on 2 October 2014, the Supreme Court noted a conversation in which a
trustee mentioned that the liquidator
had agreed to fund the litigation and
would be seeking the Court’s sanction to do so.145 In fact, a litigation
been funding the proceedings since September 2011, after the trustees
the liquidator had failed to make a funding arrangement.146 Neither the
funder, nor the funding fee, were mentioned in the final judgment
on 1 May 2015.
In that decision,
the Court was critical of the way in which the litigation was conducted,
attributing responsibility to both parties for wasted costs
and delays, and it
reduced the adverse costs that the defendant would normally be required to
2.144 Reflecting on the outcome, the National Union of Workers submitted
there should be a mechanism that informs the court that a litigation funder
is a private partner to the proceedings, to assist the
court in any
determinations it may make in the administrative proceedings of the trial and
ultimately the administration of justice.147
2.145 The proposal is not controversial. No opposition was expressed to the
court being informed when a litigation funder is involved.
However, the court
does not need to be informed in every funded case. The fact that a litigation
funder is involved in proceedings
is not in itself an issue if there is only a
single plaintiff (although it may affect the defendant’s decision about
to seek an order for security for costs), but it can
be significant in class actions and other proceedings brought by a plaintiff
on behalf of other people whose interests will be affected
by the outcome. The
Commission considers that, in these cases, the court should not only be informed
of the litigation funder’s
involvement but be given a copy of the funding
Disclosure of funding agreement
2.146 The significance of the funder’s involvement will be apparent to
the court from the funding agreement. The agreement is
at the core of the issues
raised by litigation funding practices, not only because it determines the
allocation of risks, costs and
but because it provides the framework for the relationship between the funder
and the lawyer. Its disclosure to the court would assist
in managing the
proceedings and protecting the integrity of the legal process. The court could
assess whether the terms are reasonable
and adequately provide for the interests
of people on whose behalf the
litigation has been brought. It could also identify actual or potential
conflicts of interest.148
142 However, if the effect of a contract of insurance is that the party has
no meaningful control over the conduct of proceedings,
the insurer may, instead
of the party, comply with the requirement on each party to certify, at the
commencement of proceedings,
that it has read and understood the overarching
obligations and paramount duty. This provision was introduced in 2012 to provide
flexibility when, for example, the party does not consider it appropriate to
sign the certification or cannot be found

the Supreme Court in determining that, due to their interests
in the litigation
funder and the terms of the funding agreement, counsel and lawyers for the
representative plaintiff should be prevented
from continuing to act.
2.147 Judges of the Supreme Court noted during consultations that litigation
funding arrangements can be very opaque. It can be difficult
for the court to be
aware of the impact of the litigation funder on proceedings, or the extent of
its control.149 While the degree
to which disclosure is likely to be useful in
each case would vary, disclosure of the funding agreement would assist the court
than simply being notified that a funder is involved.
2.148 A further consequence of disclosing the funding agreement to the court
is that it would protect the legitimate interests of
the defendant.150 The
defendant may wish to seek security for costs, particularly if there is doubt
to meet its obligations under the agreement;151 conversely, disclosure may
lead the defendant to decide not to apply for a security
for costs order.152
2.149 The Commission invited comments on whether disclosure of the funding
agreement to the court should be mandatory in all funded
proceedings.153 The
proposal received almost universal support. Julie-Anne Tarr, for example, called
for disclosure because:
The capacity of the courts to bring flexibility and nuance to their
supervisory or oversight role in an individual case (including
supervising
funding terms generally and confirming capital adequacy) is contingent upon
full information provided as early as
possible.154
2.150 Vicki Waye submitted that the key terms of the funding agreement should
be disclosed in all cases to support settlement and
any application for security
for costs, and to ensure that all parties are apprised of the nature of the
financial arrangements for
the proceedings:
There appears to be little justification for lack of transparency at least
insofar as key
terms are concerned, such as the extent of the indemnity provided for
adverse costs, the percentage of recoveries that the funder
is entitled to
receive and the extent of any other substantial fees.155
2.151 Any requirement to disclose the agreement to the defendant should
provide for information that is privileged, or might confer
an unfair advantage
on the defendant, to be redacted first.156 Phi Finney McDonald provided an
example of why this is necessary:
For instance, if there are terms pursuant to which the funding provided under
the agreement is capped at a particular amount (such
that the funder may elect
not to continue funding the proceeding if costs exceed a certain amount), then a
counterparty in the litigation
might deliberately engage in interlocutory
tactics intended to increase the costs incurred by the representative plaintiff
the relevant funding cap threshold, in an attempt to stymie the
litigation.157
2.152 The Commission agrees that the funding agreement should be disclosed,
although it recommends different disclosure requirements
in funded class
actions, compared to other funded proceedings, for reasons discussed below.

Disclosure in class actions
2.153 In 2010, the Supreme Court practice note for class actions was amended
to require the disclosure of litigation funding agreements
at, or prior to, the
initial case management conference.158 However, this obligation does not appear
in the current version of the
practice note, issued on 30 January 2017 (Supreme
Court Practice Note).159 The practice note was most recently revised in
conjunction
with steps by the Supreme Court to modernise and streamline its
procedures, leading to a reduction in the number of practice notes
than 150 to 48.
2.154 In contrast, the Federal Court and the Supreme Courts of New South
Wales and Queensland require the disclosure of the funding
agreement to the
court in all funded class actions, at or prior to the first case management
conference.160 The relevant provisions
for class actions in New South Wales and
Queensland replicate the provision that has since been withdrawn in
At or prior to the initial [case management conference] or directions
hearing, each party will be expected to disclose any agreement
litigation funder is to pay or contribute to the costs of the proceeding, any
security for costs or any adverse costs
order. Any funding agreement disclosed
may be redacted to conceal information which might reasonably be expected to
confer a tactical
advantage on the other party.161
2.155 The requirement to disclose is set out in greater detail in the Federal
Court practice note on class actions (Federal Court
Practice Note). Disclosure
of the full agreement to the Court is on a confidential basis. It may be a
standard form agreement, and
individual variations to the standard form that
might be negotiated with different class members need not be disclosed.162
2.156 The funding agreement must also be disclosed to other parties at least
a week before
the first case management conference. Information which might be expected to
confer a tactical advantage on another party, may be
redacted.163
2.157 In addition, the plaintiff’s lawyers are required to update the
Federal Court about any revised costs or funding agreements
(a) there is a change to the standard form of litigation funding agreement
or costs agreement which significantly alters the agreement;
(b) a proceeding not previously subject to a litigation funding agreement
becomes subject to such an agreement;
(c) there is a change of the litigation funder funding the proceeding;
(d) the litigation funder becomes insolvent or otherwise unable or unwilling
to continue to provide funding for the proceeding.164
2.158 There is broad agreement that the Supreme Court Practice Note should
contain similar disclosure requirements.165

2.159 The US Chamber Institute for Legal Reform proposed that the obligation
to disclose should be placed on the funder, rather than
on the plaintiff’s
lawyer.166 However, the Commission considers that the obligation should rest
with the lawyer, who in any
event is accountable for ensuring that all necessary
documentation for the proceeding is provided to the court. It is also likely
that the litigation funder could be based overseas.
2.160 Some stakeholders proposed the introduction of an obligation on the
court to review funding agreements.167 Allens proposed
that the court review
them at the first case management meeting, to ensure that they meet minimum
content standards and are fair:
Courts should be given the express power to stay the proceeding, or make
other orders considered to be appropriate, in circumstances
where funding
agreements do not meet the minimum content requirements or are otherwise unfair.
The onus will then be on the funder
to address those concerns to the
satisfaction of the Court.168
2.161 The Commission has reservations about proposals for state-based
regulation of litigation funders, and notes that the proponents
would prefer the
industry to be regulated nationally. Should national regulation be introduced,
compliance with required standards
should be a matter for lawyers to consider
when advising their clients about entering
a funding agreement, and for an industry regulator to monitor across the
industry. It would not be appropriate for the courts to be
given a regulatory
role beyond their proper supervisory role.
2.162 The Commission has been told that the Supreme Court of Victoria prefers
to deal with the disclosure of funding agreements in
class actions on a
case-by-case basis rather than having a standard requirement. This provides the
Court with flexibility where different
degrees of disclosure are sought.169
2.163 While this is a reasonable approach to take in view of the small number
of funded class actions in Victoria, the Commission
is concerned that, unless
funding agreements are routinely disclosed, the Court may not become aware of
issues that have affected
how the proceedings have been conducted until the
settlement approval stage. By then, there is little scope to address costs and
delays that could have been avoided, or options for settlement that could have
been explored.
2.164 Moreover, if the representative plaintiff applies for a common fund
order for the payment of the funding fee, disclosure of
the funding agreement to
the Court is critical. A common fund order enables the Court, at an appropriate
point of proceedings, to
approve the funding fee to be paid by all class
members, not just those who have signed a litigation funding agreement. In order
to determine the appropriate fee, the Court must have oversight of the terms
upon which the funding has been provided.
2.165 The Supreme Court could consider reinstating the provision that was
removed from the practice note on class actions in January
2017. This would
align its practices with those in other state-based class action regimes.
However, the Commission recommends that
consideration be given to adopting the
more prescriptive requirements of the Federal Court. As Allens highlighted in
its submission,
an increasing number of class actions are being brought by law
firms with no prior experience in this form of litigation.170 Clearer
procedures would reduce costs and delays in establishing for newcomers the form
content of the required disclosures and the need to inform the Court promptly
when any substantive changes occur. The more experienced
law firms tend to file
class actions in the Federal Court as well, and the obligations introduced by
the recommended reform would
not be novel for them. The Court would retain the
discretion to depart from the standard requirements when appropriate.

Recommendation
The Supreme Court should consider amending its practice note on
class actions to require the disclosure of litigation funding agreements
Court and other parties to class actions in similar terms to paragraph [6] of
the Federal Court of Australia’s practice
note on class actions.171
Disclosure in other funded proceedings
2.166 Submissions that commented on the issue indicated that the requirement
to disclose funding agreements should not be confined
to class actions.172 The
Commission agrees in principle but does not consider that the Court needs to be
as prescriptive in requiring
disclosure in other funded proceedings, or that
disclosure of the agreement is necessary whenever a litigation funder is
2.167 There are three reasons for this view.
1) Unlike its role in class actions, the Court does not supervise the
settlement of other proceedings. It does not have the power
to review the terms
of the agreement.
2) In non-representative funded proceedings, the terms of the agreement will
not apply to anyone who is not a participant in the
proceedings. The plaintiff
will have entered the agreement on the advice of their lawyer, who has a
fiduciary duty to their client
and a paramount duty to the court and the
administration of justice. These duties apply in all proceedings, whether or not
a litigation
funder is involved.
3) It is not clear how many proceedings, other than insolvency proceedings
(where disclosure is already likely under Commonwealth
law), are conducted by an
intermediary with the financial support of a litigation funder in Victoria,
rather than by another funding
arrangement. Where other forms of financial
assistance are used, there would be no requirement to disclose.
2.168 The Commission is concerned to ensure that, in funded cases such as
Huon Corporation
, where the outcome and costs affect the interests of
persons who do not directly participate in the proceedings, the Court is made
aware that a litigation funder is involved and the nature of its involvement.
These persons are not clients of the lawyer and have
not signed the funding
agreement. They may be well aware of the terms of
the agreement and able to protect their interests, but it is possible that
they are not. The Court should be able to dispense with
the requirement to
disclose, if appropriate, such as when the disputants are knowledgeable and
experienced in litigation of that
2.169 A requirement to disclose the funding agreement in these proceedings
could be introduced by amendments to the practice notes
to proceedings in the
Commercial Court173 and relevant lists in the Common Law Division.174 The
requirement could be couched in
the same terms as the provision that was removed
from the practice note in class actions.

Recommendation
In addition to the introduction of disclosure obligations in class
actions, the Supreme Court should consider requiring the plaintiff’s
lawyers to provide the Court with a copy of the litigation funding agreement
whenever a litigation funder is involved in a proceeding
where a number of
disputants are represented by an intermediary. Any funding agreement disclosed
other party should be able to be redacted to conceal information which
might reasonably be expected to confer a tactical advantage
on that party.
Disclosure of other sources of external funding
2.170 Some stakeholders suggested that the requirement to disclose should
extend to the disclosure by both plaintiffs and defendants
of any source of
external funding, including from an insurer, employer or union.175 It was argued
that information about the terms
on which the defendant’s lawyers are
acting, their likely costs, and any indemnity available under an applicable
policy is as relevant to the plaintiff as information about the
plaintiff’s funding arrangements is to the defendant.176
2.171 The Commission does not consider that disclosure of other sources of
external funding, whether or not they exercise effective
control, should be
introduced in funded proceedings. The fact that the plaintiff has entered an
agreement with a litigation funder
is not sufficient basis to impose additional
disclosure requirements of this nature on
both the plaintiff and the defendant in these proceedings, as distinct from
unfunded proceedings.
Disclosure to class members or other represented disputants
2.172 The terms of reference raise the question of whether clearer
requirements should be imposed on litigation funders and lawyers
funded plaintiffs about the progress, costs and possible outcomes of
proceedings.
Disclosure by litigation funders
2.173 The funding agreement is the primary means by which litigation funders
disclose information about the funding arrangements.
The terms can be
complicated, and how much the funder is entitled to receive if the litigation is
successful may not be clear until
the resolution of the proceedings. The US
Chamber Institute for Legal Reform noted
that funding agreements are not readily understood by non-lawyers and it is
critical that clients understand the terms of the arrangement
they are entering
into, the costs they will incur and the ultimate return they may receive from
the litigation.177 While lawyers
have a duty to inform their clients about the
costs of the litigation and should explain the terms
of the funding agreement to them, the litigation funder is the source of the
information and needs to ensure that it is accurately
and clearly expressed.
2.174 IMF Bentham, for example, indicated that it has a comprehensive
approach to disclosure:
IMF’s practice in the class actions it funds is for prospective class
members to be made aware of the litigation funding fees
before they sign a
funding agreement with IMF. IMF sends to these class members a copy of the
proposed retainer agreement, the litigation
funding agreement, a list of
frequently asked questions and a disclosure document (which explains, among
other things, the services
IMF provides and identifies risks to
175 Submissions 14 (IMF Bentham Ltd), 15 (Phi Finney McDonald).
176 Submission 15 (Phi Finney McDonald).
177 Submission 19 (US Chamber Institute for Legal
claimants in funded litigation). These documents contain information about
the likely legal costs and disbursements that are anticipated
to be incurred and
information about the funding fee, reimbursement of costs and any other charges
that are payable to IMF in the
event of success.178
2.175 Of greatest importance is that the potential client receives the
information they need,
in a form that they understand, to enable them to decide whether to enter the
funding agreement. What is not provided directly by
the funder should be
provided by the lawyer.
2.176 Although the content of litigation funding agreements is not regulated,
litigation funders have significant responsibilities
to disclose information
that reveals actual or potential conflicts of interest, and how they will be
managed, before the client enters
the funding agreement. In addition, the
funding agreement should disclose the terms of the agreement between the funder
and the lawyer.
These and other requirements regarding managing conflicts of
interest are set out in a regulatory guide issued by ASIC, discussed
– [2.113]. The Commission considers that any additional obligations on
litigation funders to disclose information
imposed by national regulation.
2.177 Once the funding agreement is in place, both the funder and the
client rely on the lawyer for advice about the progress,
costs and possible
outcomes of the litigation. There would be little utility in requiring funders
to advise the client about these
Disclosure by lawyers
Legal costs and disbursements
2.178 At the commencement of any proceeding—including class actions,
whether or not they are financed by a litigation funder—lawyers
Victoria are required to inform their clients of what they expect the legal
costs to be.179 Their legal costs must be fair, reasonable
proportionate.180
2.179 The Legal Profession Uniform Law sets out duties of disclosure
regarding costs.181
These are reinforced by the courts’ power to require lawyers to give
their clients written information about accrued and estimated
costs and the
expected length of the proceedings.182 Not only must lawyers disclose the
information, they must satisfy
themselves that the client, or potential client, understands what they have
been told.183
2.180 The requirements to disclose information about legal costs are well
established and do not appear to raise particular issues
in funded proceedings.
Clients, and potential clients, in funded proceedings are entitled to the same
information about costs as
receive in other proceedings. The information provided should be sufficient
to inform their decision about whether to enter a legal
retainer, and they will
also be informed of any significant changes during the proceedings.
2.181 In class actions, not all class members will necessarily be clients,
yet all contribute to legal costs. The Commission recommends
in Chapter 4 that
law firms provide the Supreme Court, and all class members, with a summary
statement about the class action, including
how legal costs and disbursements
will be charged; see [4.235] – [4.241].

whom or for whom legal services are provided’:

Litigation funding costs
2.182 As the Victorian Legal Services Board and Commissioner pointed out,
litigation funding fees do not fall within the definition
of legal costs.184
2.183 Even though lawyers are not expressly required to disclose information
proceedings, their clients
should normally receive this information under current regulatory requirements.
Lawyers would need to
disclose the terms of the litigation funding agreement to
their clients when explaining the estimated costs of the litigation. In
addition, disclosure of the funding fee will always occur when
a lawyer advises a client who is considering whether to enter a litigation
funding agreement.
2.184 In contrast, in funded class actions there is ambiguity about the
lawyer’s duty to disclose information about funding
costs to class members
who are not clients. The Federal Court has addressed the issue by requiring
lawyers to disclose comprehensive
information about litigation funding charges
in class actions. This is discussed below.
Disclosure to class members
Information about the funding agreement
2.185 By the time a funded class action commences, the funder and the lawyer
will have entered into contractual arrangements with
each other, as well as
individually with the representative plaintiff. Disclosures to the
representative plaintiff, and other class
members who enter the funding agreement and legal retainer at the
commencement of proceedings, will not necessarily reach all of the
class members
who ultimately participate in the proceedings or contribute to the costs.
2.186 In an open class action, the class is likely to include members who
have not entered a funding agreement as well as those who
have. If the court
makes a common fund order or a funding equalisation order, all class members
must pay a proportion of any settlement
or judgment amount they receive to cover
the costs of bringing proceedings, whether or not they have executed agreements
effect. Disclosure about the funding arrangement in these circumstances
is even more important to enable them to make informed decisions
participation.185
2.187 Stakeholders generally agreed that lawyers should be expressly required
to disclose funding costs to class members. This is
important not only to
ensure that all class members can make informed choices, but also to manage the
risk of conflicts of interest.
It was observed, for example, that there is no
evidence that lawyers ‘shop around’ for
the best funding arrangement for class members and that increasing
transparency would improve accountability.186
2.188 As the lawyer is a party to the funding agreement in class actions, the
client should have the opportunity to obtain independent
legal advice.187 This
is a matter that could be addressed in professional guidelines for lawyers on
managing conflicts of interest,
but the Commission does not consider that
independent legal advice should be mandatory. Whether to seek additional legal
or financial
advice, from whom, and at what cost, is a matter for the client to
2.189 The task of disclosing funding costs clearly and simply is not easy.
Costs arise from a number of sources and are unlikely to
be standard or
consistent for the duration of proceedings. For example, a litigation funder may
stipulate a particular funding fee
in the funding agreement, but also hold a
contractual entitlement to increase the rate in particular circumstances, such
the commencement of proceedings is delayed.
185 Submission 28 (Slater and Gordon Lawyers).
186 Roundtable 1 (professional stakeholders).
187 Submissions 19 (US Chamber Institute for Legal Reform), 25 (Dr
Michael Duffy), 28 (Slater and Gordon Lawyers).
A litigation funder may also be contractually entitled to additional fees,
such as a project management fee, upon crystallisation
of certain events or
timeframes.
2.190 Maurice Blackburn pointed out that funding agreements invariably
specify the basis on which the fee is charged but that it
is impractical to
disclose estimated total amounts because they are not known until settlement. It
noted that the Federal Court’s
requirement to disclose information about
litigation funding costs is satisfied if class members have been given a
document that
properly discloses these charges, and this is likely to be the
funding agreement.188
2.191 IMF Bentham pointed out that compliance with a disclosure requirement
would be difficult when the law firm does not hold the
precise identity and
In most class actions, the identity of all group members is unknown to both
plaintiffs and defendants alike. In most mass torts, there
is rarely a central
registry of relevant individuals who have suffered the harm complained about. In
shareholder litigation, the
share registry is a helpful but quite imperfect
guide to those that may have claims in the action; its key deficiency arises
the prevalence of nominee or custodian holders of securities who appear on
the register but do not hold the beneficial interest in
the shares. Newspaper
adverts have become increasingly ineffective at reaching the
population at-large. In most cases, plaintiffs need the assistance of court
orders to gain access to the relevant lists identifying
potential group members
or for notices to be sent to relevant lists identifying potential group
members.190
2.192 The Commission considers that an obligation to disclose information
While logistical
difficulties in contacting class members may be increasing, so too are the
options for overcoming them. Experienced
class action law firms are developing
innovative methods of communicating effectively with large numbers of people.191
As the primary
aim of class actions is to enable access to justice, it is
essential to continue to give priority to reaching class members.
Obligation to disclose funding information
2.193 A number of submissions supported the introduction of a
requirement, in the Supreme Court Practice Note, for lawyers to
litigation funding costs to class members on terms similar to those that apply
in the Federal Court.192
2.194 The Federal Court Practice Note sets out how lawyers should disclose
legal costs and any ‘litigation funding charges’
to current (and
potential) clients in class actions, both at commencement and during the
proceedings. Litigation funding charges
include any funding fee and any other
charges (including those estimated) to be charged to class members.
2.195 The requirements regarding litigation funding charges include the
• The litigation funding agreement must be in writing.
• Any notification of litigation funding charges must be in clear
terms, and provided as soon as practicable.
• The obligation is ongoing and applies to any material change to the
• Failure to notify class members of the litigation funding charges may
be taken into account by the Court at settlement.

(Phi Finney McDonald), 21 (Law Council of Australia), 28 (Slater and Gordon
• The obligation regarding disclosure of litigation funding charges is
satisfied if
class members have been provided with a document that properly discloses
those charges.193
2.196 The Commission agrees that the Federal Court Practice Note provides a
useful approach to the disclosure of funding costs and
considers there would be
benefit in introducing similar provisions into the equivalent practice note
issued by the Supreme Court.
However, the Commission does not propose that the
accompanying provisions regarding disclosure of legal costs should be
incorporated
because existing legal costs disclosure rules in Victoria are
2.197 Lawyers could be encouraged to disclose funding costs in conjunction
with the disclosure of legal costs, which would ensure
that class members are
better placed to understand the cumulative effect.
2.198 The disclosure requirement should not be a significant burden on law
firms. It would
be similar to existing obligations, as explained by the Victorian Legal
Services Board and
Commissioner:
Many plaintiff lawyers are already used to advising of other deductions from
settlement monies, like Medicare and Centrelink repayments.
The lawyers are in
possession of the information and can reasonably be expected to be in a position
to explain and disclose this
information to class members, particularly its
relationship to legal costs. Lawyers need to consider their duty to act in the
interest of their clients in the context of disclosure about features of
the litigation funding agreement, the fee in its various
scenarios and other
matters such as opt out provisions for the litigation funder.
The litigation funding fees are intricately related to the conduct of the
litigation in class actions so the burden imposed by a Practice
Note requirement
does not appear significant.194
Recommendation
The Supreme Court should consider amending its practice note on
class actions to provide that, if a class action is funded by a litigation
(a) the representative plaintiff’s lawyers should notify class
members (whether they are actual or potential clients), in clear
terms and as
soon as practicable, of any applicable litigation funding charges and any
material changes to those charges
(b) the obligation to notify is satisfied if class members have been
provided with a document that properly discloses those charges
(c) failure to meet the obligation to notify may be taken into account
by the Court in relation to settlement approval under
section 33V
Supreme Court Act 1986
Funding Information Summary Statements
2.199 The effectiveness of disclosure depends not only on the information
being given, but also the form in which it is given. A number
of submissions
proposed that class members be provided with simplified information. In Chapter
4, the Commission makes recommendations
to simplify and standardise, where
possible, formal notices

Commissioner).
provided to class members and to enhance the information about class actions
that the Supreme Court publishes on its website. Recommendations
are also made
to simplify the information that lawyers provide about the proceedings.
2.200 With regard to information about funding costs, Allens proposed that
class members should not only be provided with a copy of
the funding agreement
but also an accompanying notice which explains the material terms of the
agreement and associated risks in
Plain English.195 Chartered Accountants
Australia and New Zealand highlighted
the need to set parameters around disclosure so that it provides
‘relevant, comparable and understandable’ information
terms of the funding, charges and additional fees or arrangements, including any
indemnities given to the representative
plaintiff by the funder.196 Michael
Duffy proposed that, before entering a funding agreement, the
litigation funder should be subject to a statutory requirement to provide
clients with a Key Facts disclosure document that sets out
key conditions and
litigation funding charges in a standard and simplified form.197
2.201 Some litigation funders already provide simple summary information to
potential clients.
This practice should be encouraged under any national regulatory scheme. Some
law firms publish useful information for class members
on their websites,
written in a simple style. Funders and lawyers with less experience in class
actions or involved in smaller claims
tend to provide fewer details than those
with a more established presence in the market.
2.202 The Commission considers that there would be benefit in publishing
standard key facts about the funding arrangements of class
actions on the
Supreme Court’s website. It would be published in conjunction with a
summary statement about the class action
(recommended in Chapter 4). This
measure would provide a supplementary means of contacting class members who are
not known to the
lawyers conducting the class action. It would also ensure that
class members in all funded proceedings are aware that a litigation
involved and the implications for them generally.
2.203 The standard information would be drawn from a Funding Information
Summary Statement that the lawyers would provide to the Supreme
Court. The key
facts to be provided should be identified by the Supreme Court in consultation
with stakeholders. They should be brief
and not provide a tactical advantage to
the defendant. They could
include, for example, the identity of the litigation funder, the basic terms
of the agreement, the basis on which the funding fee
is calculated, whether the
funding fee adds to or replaces other costs if the litigation is successful, and
where to obtain more
information.
Recommendation
The Supreme Court should consider amending its class action
practice note to require the representative plaintiff’s lawyers
class actions
to provide to the Court, when the writ for the proceeding is filed, a
brief Funding Information Summary Statement that accurately
sets out litigation
funding charges and key conditions in a simplified form, for publication on the
Supreme Court’s website.

2.204 The Commission does not recommend imposing obligations on lawyers in

information to any

behalf of others to be conveying to them

actions, who is not appointed by the class members and is not their
intermediary.
2.205 The client would be advised about the litigation funding agreement when
deciding whether to enter it. In addition, the need
to disclose and explain the
costs of the proceedings is well established in current regulations, and keeping
the client informed
of progress is inherent to the responsibilities of legal
2.206 In funded proceedings other than class actions, the client may also be
directly informed by the litigation funder about the
terms of the agreement, as
observed by Litigation Funding Solutions:
It is important to note that every case involving litigation funding is
different. In many cases the funder has no relationship with
the lawyer at all.
From LFS’ experience however, when a litigation funder agrees to fund a
case on a bi-lateral basis, they
do so by entering into a litigation funding
agreement with the plaintiff. This means that the plaintiff and the funder are,
the only two parties to the contract. Consequently, this means that the
plaintiff is aware of the cost structure and is up to date
changes to the funding agreement. Therefore, the lawyer is not in a position
to withhold any funding charges, or some such, in the
first place.198
2.207 IMF Bentham, while not objecting to it, submitted that it would not
be necessary to introduce a specific obligation on lawyers
to disclose funding
information in funded proceedings other than class actions:
When IMF funds proceedings other than class actions, it enters into a
funding agreement with the plaintiff client. The litigation funding agreement
discloses information about the litigation funding fee
(or commission) and
reimbursement of costs and any other charges that may be payable to IMF in the
event of success. IMF and the
plaintiff enter into a litigation funding
agreement after IMF has performed due diligence on the proposed claim and has
made a funding
proposal to the plaintiff. In all cases, IMF recommends that its
prospective funded plaintiffs obtain independent legal advice as
to the meaning and effect of its litigation funding agreements before
entering into the litigation funding agreement. It is difficult
to conceive of a
situation in which a plaintiff would enter into a litigation funding agreement
with a commercial funder without
being aware of the litigation funding commission, the reimbursement of costs
and other charges payable to the litigation funder.199
2.208 All but one submission that commented on the issue agreed that an
additional disclosure obligation on the lawyer is not warranted.200
Commission agrees.

Litigation funding
and contingency fees
52 Introduction
52 Whether lifting the ban on contingency fees would mitigate issues with
litigation funding practices
63 The introduction of contingency fees in class actions
3. Litigation funding and contingency fees
Introduction
3.1 While it is standard practice for litigation funders to be paid a
percentage of the amount recovered if the claim is successful,
lawyers are not
permitted to charge on this basis. The practice is prohibited nationally, under
state and territory legislation.1
3.2 The Commission has been asked to report on whether removing the
prohibition on law firms charging contingency fees would mitigate
presented by litigation funding (except in personal injury, criminal and family
law matters and other areas in which contingency
fees would be inappropriate).
Three core issues have been identified, as discussed in Chapter 2: case
selection, costs and client
interests. They encapsulate the limitations of
litigation funding as a means of providing access to justice, in the sense
of enabling a person to use the legal system to enforce their rights, and
ensuring a fair process and outcome.
3.3 There has been debate for many years about whether lawyers should be able
to charge contingency fees, and it remains unresolved.
It is a national
issue—any changes should be introduced across all jurisdictions and be
based on far broader considerations
than the impact on the practice of
litigation funding. However, responding to the terms
of reference has provided an opportunity to consider the scope for market
forces to improve access to justice, and the safeguards
that would need to be
put in place to avoid unintended consequences if the ban were lifted. The first
part of this chapter sets out
the Commission’s consideration of each of
the three issues.
3.4 The second part of this chapter puts forward a reform proposal for
lawyers to receive a percentage share of the proceeds of a
class action, under a
common fund order made by the Court and subject to conditions that address
concerns about costs and conflict
of interest when contingency fees are charged.
It would provide a means of reducing the costs and risks to representative
in class actions that do not involve a litigation funder, in confined
and controlled circumstances, without lifting the general ban
on contingency
Whether lifting the ban on contingency fees would mitigate issues with
litigation funding practices
3.5 To mitigate issues with litigation funding practices, lifting the ban on
lawyers being able to charge contingency fees would need
• expand the availability of funding to cases that are uneconomic for
litigation funders to support
1 In Victoria, the prohibition is contained in
Legal Profession
Uniform Law Application Act 2014
Vic) sch 1 (Legal Profession Uniform
It prohibits a law practice from entering a legal costs
agreement under which a contingency fee is payable.
• reduce costs to plaintiffs
• ensure that client interests are not sidelined in favour of the
funder’s financial interests.
3.6 In theory, enabling lawyers to charge contingency fees would foster
competition to fund the types of claim that litigation funders
currently invest
in, and make funding available to claims that do not presently attract funding.
Stakeholders acknowledge that there
would be greater competition, but disagree
Case selection
3.7 The first issue is whether lifting the ban would broaden the range of
meritorious cases that attract funding. Would permitting
lawyers to charge
contingency fees enable greater access to justice generally by making funding
available for small claims, or by
broadening the types of claim that are brought
as class actions?
3.8 Many submissions advanced the view that lifting the ban would lead
to a wider range of cases being funded, although they
identified a variety of
reasons for this and drew different conclusions about whether or not it would be
Smaller claims
3.9 It is widely thought that lifting the ban would result in smaller and
lower-value claims being funded. This prospect was welcomed
by stakeholders who
supported the introduction of contingency fees.
• Maurice Blackburn argued in its submission that lifting the ban would
increase market competition and put downward pressure
on the costs of
litigation. Cases that would not be funded by a litigation funder in the current
market could proceed largely because
they would not need to generate the high
returns that litigation funders usually require.2
• Slater and Gordon suggested that law firms would be more willing to
bear the risk of prosecuting lower-value claims if exposure
to the risk could be
spread across a number of differently funded cases, including cases for which
contingency fees are charged but
also cases that are charged on a ‘no win,
no fee’ basis or financed by a litigation funder.3
• Warren Mundy also considered it likely that many small and isolated
litigants who are currently overlooked due to the economies
of scale inherent in
the businesses of litigation funders could proceed if the ban were lifted. He
suggested this would
especially occur if legal practices were able to specialise and build up a
client portfolio that diversified the firm’s risk
exposure without needing
recourse to the capital required by third-party funders.4
• The Consumer Action Law Centre endorsed the recommendations of the
Productivity Commission, which found that lifting the ban
would provide access
to justice for people who do not qualify for free or low-cost legal assistance
services but cannot afford a
private lawyer (known as the ‘missing
• The Australian Shareholders’ Association said that lifting the
ban would allow smaller- scale class actions of merit
to be tested.6

3.10 Maurice Blackburn operates a litigation funding business, Claims Funding
Australia Pty Ltd, that funds other law firms in general
commercial litigation.
It routinely sees cases which are uneconomic to fund or would be run more
favourably to clients under a contingency
fee basis. The following is an example
of how contingency fees would enable smaller claims to be pursued:
Consider a case for a small business claiming $2 million with a litigation
$250,000. If the small business cannot afford to pay the legal fees (and many
could not) then no matter how meritorious the claim,
it is unlikely under
current legislative restrictions that it will be run: litigation funding is
unlikely to be available (and
if it is, it will likely see more than half the
recovered sum paid in legal fees and commission)
and experience suggests a case like this is unlikely to be run on a
conditional fee basis. However, the case could be run on a 25%
contingency fee.7
3.11 Not all submissions welcomed the prospect of a greater number of
lower-value claims being funded. The US Chamber Institute for
Legal Reform
warned that lifting the ban would open the Australian legal system to some of
the excesses experienced in the United
Many small firms will, for the first time, have the opportunity to
‘take a punt’—not
just for their normal fee plus an uplift but rather for what some will see as
a significant windfall profit. However, as Associate
Professor Michael Legg and
his colleagues have observed in the context of the class action market, an
increase in the overall number
of claims is likely to see a reduction in the
quality and merit of new claims. In other words, more marginal claims are likely
be accepted and commenced. ... even in Australia
with the risk of an adverse costs order, there would likely be an increase in
unmeritorious claims with the introduction of contingency
fees, as there is in
the United States,
because most cases settle.8
3.12 Comparisons with jurisdictions that have experience with contingency
fees are instructive in identifying possible unwanted consequences,
even though
they are poor predictors
of what will happen in Australia in different circumstances and at a
different time. The Commission notes the concern that lifting
the ban could
encourage unmeritorious litigation, as has occurred in the United States, but
considers the risk to be manageable.
This is in part due to the operation of the
costs-shifting rule in Australia, which, by requiring an unsuccessful party to
pay adverse
costs, acts as a disincentive to commencing unmeritorious
litigation.
3.13 The introduction of contingency fees for legal services in Canada, where
the costs-shifting rule applies, does not appear to
have replicated the
experience of the United States. Jasminka Kalajdzik, an Associate Professor at
the University of Windsor and
a co-leader
of a current project by the Law Commission of Ontario on class actions, has
conducted research into the factors that determined the
selection decisions of
members of the class action plaintiff bar in Canada. The results show that the
risk of adverse costs acts
as a disincentive to lawyers commencing
unmeritorious litigation.9
3.14 A different approach has been taken in England and Wales, where lawyers
have been permitted to charge contingency fees, or damages-based
(DBAs), for litigation and arbitration proceedings since 1 April 2013. The
introduction of DBAs was part of a package
of reforms to control costs and
promote access to justice. Contingency fees may be charged in all areas of
litigation, including
personal injury claims, subject
to different caps. However they may not be charged in the class action
procedures introduced in October 2015 for competition law claims.10

actions would give rise to a ‘litigation

culture’.11 The DBA regulations do not specify whether lawyers who
charge contingency fees are liable for any adverse costs.12
There has been
limited uptake of DBAs in litigation, possibly due to the nature and complexity
of the regulatory controls and the
impact of costs-shifting.13
Higher value claims
3.15 Allens predicted that, rather than funding more lower-value claims,
lifting the ban would increase competition for the high-value/lower-risk
that are already well serviced
by litigation funders or lawyers charging on a ‘no win, no fee’
basis. This was expected because they would apply the
same selection criteria as
litigation funders.
3.16 The increased competition could drive down the fee charged for funding
those types of claim, but not direct funding to new areas.
the areas of the greatest unmet legal need of which we are aware are clients
using homeless persons’ legal clinics, people with
mental illnesses,
impecunious litigants and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
communities. The claims relating to these
groups typically relate to consumer,
government and housing matters which are less likely to result in large awards
of damages.
In our view, lifting the prohibition on contingency fees is unlikely to
address this unmet legal need. As contingency fees are charged
by reference to
the value of the claim, lawyers will likely replicate the commercial approach
taken by third party litigation funders
when selecting which cases to fund.
Further, if the areas of unmet legal need identified above are not already
assisted by lawyers
acting pro bono or charging on a conditional fee basis, it
is difficult to see how lawyers charging contingency fees would address
3.17 Similarly, IMF Bentham said that there is no evidence to show that
lawyers charging contingency fees would fund a greater range
of cases than
litigation funders, including social justice cases.15
3.18 It is possible that lifting the ban would affect the litigation funding
market in all of the ways predicted. Large law firms
that can raise the
necessary capital could compete with litigation funders to fund high value
claims; smaller law firms could pursue
a greater number of lower value
3.19 An increase in the availability of funding for lower-value claims would
accelerate a trend that is already evident within the
litigation funding
industry. There is some confidence that litigation funders will fund a more
diverse selection of claims, whether
or not the ban on contingency fees is
lifted. Slater and Gordon said that the present tendency of litigation funders
to invest in
shareholder and investor class actions is a product of the relative
infancy of the class actions regime and acceptance of third-party
funding. It submitted that the trend towards diversification of the matters
which attract funding will continue.16 IMF
Bentham also maintained that the
market is changing. It said that funders, and particularly some new entrants to
the market, are
increasingly looking at funding smaller claims.17

3.20 Case selection decisions may also be affected by procedural decisions of
According to Phi Finney McDonald, a broader range of cases is likely to be
funded in the future because of the rise of the common
fund order, which removes
the need to sign up class members to funding agreements. If the ban on
contingency fees were lifted, common
fund orders would offer the advantage of
not requiring lawyers to secure retainers from a substantial proportion of class
individually.18
3.21 Although the likely impact that lifting the ban would have on the number
of unmeritorious claims needs to be considered, it appears
to pose no greater
that arising from new litigation funders investing in smaller claims. Both
the lawyers and the litigation funders would be making
commercial decisions that
limit potential losses. However, this is not to say that they would select the
same cases. The fact that
most class actions in Victoria, including the largest,
have been conducted without the support of a litigation funder, indicates
law firms are prepared to carry commercial risk to support meritorious claims
that do not meet the selection criteria that litigation
funders normally
3.22 The second issue is whether lifting the ban would reduce the costs of
bringing proceedings. Views differ on whether contingency
fees would result in
lower costs compared to current billing methods, and whether, if they were
lower, the client would receive the
same level of protection against the risks
and upfront costs of the litigation.
Comparative costs
3.23 Simply removing the need to pay a third-party funder suggests that the
costs would
be less. The Australian Shareholders’ Association pointed out that
lifting the ban could improve the returns to class members
because the costs
overall would be substantially lower than the combined costs of a third-party
funder and lawyer.19
3.24 This view is supported by analysis conducted by Maurice Blackburn.
Maurice Blackburn has compared the distribution of the total
settlement amount
of the 14 funded class actions it has settled since 2006, with the likely
outcome if a funder had not been involved
and the firm had been able to charge a
contingency fee. Whereas 60 per cent of the total settlement amount in these
cases was returned
to the claimants, 75 per cent would have been returned if a
contingency fee of 25 per cent had been charged.20
3.25 The outcome of these cases is similar to results reported by IMF
Bentham. The cases funded by IMF Bentham have returned approximately
62 per cent
of the settlement value to the claimants, after a share of 38 per cent was paid
in legal and funding costs.21
3.26 Maurice Blackburn and IMF Bentham act in larger cases where there
are economies of scale. In smaller settlements, the proportion
allocated for
costs and funding charges is generally higher and the return to the claimants
3.27 Based on the calculations by Maurice Blackburn, clients would be better
off than under existing third-party litigation funding
arrangements if the
contingency fee is less than
37 per cent. However, a comparison with current costs when a litigation
funder is not involved may not be as favourable: contingency
fees could be
greater than what is presently charged through time-based billing alone.23 In
these cases, the clients would be worse
off than now.

23 For example, in Victorian Supreme Court personal injury cases in 2009 and
2010 with recoveries over $1 million dollars, legal fees
equated to about 5% of
the recovered amount: Submission 9 (Professor Simone Degeling, Associate
Professor Michael Legg, Dr James
The terms of reference exclude personal injury cases from the
litigation for which contingency fees could possibly be charged.
3.28 Current billing methods are likely to be retained if they would result
in a higher payment to the law firm than a contingency
fee. Lawyers in England
and Wales have been able
to charge contingency fees since 2013 but there is little evidence they are
doing so. It appears that contingency fees are charged
only where there is a
clear financial advantage for lawyers equal to the risk taken. Otherwise, the
clients are charged another way.24
3.29 The extent to which charging a contingency fee would increase or
decrease the costs to the client in a particular case, compared
to existing cost
arrangements, would depend on the terms of the costs agreement. Slater and
Gordon noted that the fee could be stepped:
In light of the value placed on flexibility and innovation within the legal
sector, we would not expect that the introduction of a contingency fee regime
would automatically lead to a simplistic ‘flat-fee’
approach that
may give rise to the risk
of ‘windfall fees’. As is common in other existing forms of legal
costs agreements, we would expect that in many cases
a staged or stepped model
to rates would be adopted—for instance, a low rate if a matter resolves
prior to trial, a moderate
rate if it resolves during trial, and a higher rate
if a case is required to be taken to appellate stages.25
Comparative risk
3.30 When comparing contingency fees charged by lawyers and funding fees
charged by litigation funders, it is important that they
cover the same risks.
Currently, lawyers who
act on a ‘no win, no fee’ basis bear the risk of not being paid
for their legal work, but the client remains liable for
all other costs in the
event of an unsuccessful outcome. This risk
is reflected in the uplift fee that lawyers can charge in addition to the
fees for the work performed if the litigation is successful.
To match the
standard risk coverage that litigation funders provide, law firms charging
contingency fees would also need to cover
the client for any security for costs
order and, if the litigation is unsuccessful, for disbursements and adverse
3.31 This appears to have been provided for in the comparative analysis by
Maurice Blackburn, which compared a single deduction for
‘funding charges
and legal costs’ with a single contingency fee of 25 per cent.26 However,
while a large firm such as
Maurice Blackburn could match the risk coverage that
litigation funders provide, smaller firms would be unable to do so.
3.32 For this reason, IMF Bentham argued that lifting the ban on contingency
fees would not reduce costs, adding that too much pressure
to do so could cause
litigation funders to withdraw from the market:
there are very few law firms that would have the capital and risk appetite to
fund class actions, including disbursements and provide
adverse costs cover. It
is likely that law firms will still look to third party litigation funders to
and/or costs cover. There is also a risk
that any changes that put too much downward pressure on funding fees could end
less competition in the
litigation funding market if funders’ return on investment became too
low to absorb the risks they are required to undertake,
particularly adverse
costs risks.27

Management: Some Emerging Themes’ (Paper presented at

Council Conference, 21 March 2014) 6, 10. The reasons for the reluctance to
charge contingency fees are unclear
and may include confusion about regulation
and the impact of costs shifting, and the conservatism of the legal profession.

3.33 Litigation Capital Management said that the cost of litigation funding
is unlikely to be mitigated because funding fees are
not determined by the
level of competition.
Funding Costs charged by funders are a reflection of the considerable risks
and costs involved in financing a third party’s
litigation.
Despite there being significant competition in the litigation funding market,
the funding fees offered by Australian litigation funders
are not greatly
varied, and LCM submits
that over the life of the litigation funding industry, the economics of
funding have
driven funders’ pricing to their present rates.... it’s
unrealistic to expect that the lawyers’
financial considerations would not drive their contingency fee rates into a
similar range to that of litigation funding commissions.
Consequently, LCM submits that it is ‘far from given’ that
lifting the ban would mitigate the cost of litigation funding.28
3.34 These observations by litigation funders underscore the fact that the
rate charged for
a contingency fee, like that charged for litigation funding fee, is a
commercial decision. Decisions of this type can assist in achieving
interest goals but may need to be harnessed to them by regulation. Many
submissions suggested control measures that could
be put in place if the ban
were lifted. They are discussed later in this chapter at [3.77] –
3.35 Whether lifting the ban on contingency fees would reduce the costs to
litigants would depend on the size of the law firm and
the size of the claim. A
law firm that has access to the considerable amount of capital required could
compete with litigation funders
to invest in large commercial claims and high
value class actions. Even if the contingency
fee it charged were no less than the funding fee of its competitors, the cost
to the client would be lower because there would be
only a single deduction from
the settlement amount. In proceedings funded by a litigation funder, the client
is charged for legal
costs in addition to the funding fee. For Victoria’s
class action regime, where litigation funders infrequently participate,
impact of greater competition at this end of the market would be less than in
class actions at the federal level.
3.36 The potential impact on smaller claims is unclear. The primary benefit
of lifting the ban is that it would provide a funding
option that enables
pursuit of claims that are not suitable for litigation funding or charging on a
‘no win, no fee’
basis. However, law firms would not confine the
claims for which contingency fees are charged to those within this category. It
reasonable to expect contingency fees to be charged for some types of claim
that previously would have been pursued, at less cost
to the client, on a
‘no win, no fee’ basis.
3.37 For the client, the payment of a contingency fee should provide the same
or similar protection from the financial risks and cost
burdens of pursuing the
claim as is currently provided by litigation funders. Moreover, the overall
costs to the client should not
increase as a result. These requirements indicate
that any introduction of contingency fees for legal services would need to be
Client interests
3.38 The third issue concerns the risk that the financial interests of the
funder will prevail over those of the plaintiff in decisions
which the litigation is conducted and resolved. If lawyers were also permitted
to charge a fee that is determined
by the financial outcome of the litigation,
the risk would shift to them. The question for consideration is whether lawyers
a contingency fee would manage the risk as effectively as, or better
than, litigation funders.
28 Submission 14 (LCM).
3.39 The comments made in submissions and during consultations put forward
arguments about the possible impact of the ban on the independence
and their ability to manage the conflict between their interests and those of
their clients.
The independence of lawyers
3.40 The prohibition on lawyers being able to charge contingency fees arises
from the need
to avoid perverse incentives. Lawyers have fundamental duties, first to the
court and the administration of justice, and, secondly,
to their clients. Their
ethical and professional obligations pervade all aspects of the legal services
they provide. Stakeholders
argued that lifting the ban on contingency fees could
potentially compromise the independence of lawyers and fundamentally change
their relationship with their clients, because the lawyer would have a direct
financial interest in the outcome.29
3.41 Several submissions contended that not only would the conflict of
interest issues that arise when a litigation funder is involved
in litigation
shift to lawyers who charge contingency fees, the issues would get worse.30 The
Victorian Legal Services Board and
Commissioner expressed concern that lawyers
would be unable to manage the risk:
In the class action context, allowing lawyers to charge contingency fees does
not remove the conflict of interest inherent in accessing
a separate litigation
funder, it only shifts the conflict directly onto the shoulders of the lawyer, a
burden that in our view will
be too much to bear for some.31
3.42 The Victorian Legal Services Board and Commissioner indicated that some
lawyers would be less inclined to act in family law,
criminal and personal
injury matters, for which contingency fees could not be charged.32 Comments from
the healthcare sector raised
the possibility that lifting of the ban on
contingency fees would lead to predatory and harmful advertising, where lawyers
deliberately
focus on a person’s concern about their health
and that of family and friends to generate business.33
3.43 It was further suggested that the change to the power balance between
lawyers and clients if the lawyer were also the financier
would weaken the
client’s ability to negotiate the fee and could lead to an increase in
unmeritorious litigation.34 The lawyer
would have complete control over the
litigation due to the asymmetry of information.35
3.44 This unequal balance of power and information was contrasted with the
relationship that currently arises between the litigation
funder, lawyer and
client in funded class actions. Although the tripartite structure itself creates
conflicts of interest, it is
a means of providing checks and balances, sharing
power and ensuring that conflicts of interest are managed.36
3.45 Allens argued that lifting the ban would threaten the balance that the
High Court sought to achieve in
Campbell’s Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v
Fostif Pty Ltd
37 when it permitted third- party litigation funding because
the independent lawyer was a bulwark for the client against the funder’s
commercial interests.38 Litigation Capital Management said that it
is impossible to see how the conflict issues that arise in a tripartite
funding arrangement could be mitigated by merging the interests
of two of the
three parties:39

in practice, the separation between the funder and the lawyers, the
funder’s limited ability to take steps without the lawyers’
involvement and the litigant’s approval, and the lawyers’ overriding
duty to act in the interest of the litigant, all
serve as effective safeguards
for that litigant’s interests.
Presently, the lawyers can advise a litigant to take a course that may be
contrary to the interests of the funder. However, if the
lawyers are the funder,
they will be constantly faced with decisions on how and when to disclose
specific conflicts to clients, and
how and when to advise clients against the
lawyers’ own interests. The resulting minefield
is unlikely to be entirely transparent and cannot be said to mitigate any
issue said to be presented by the practice of litigation
Ability to manage conflicts of interest
3.46 Supporters of lifting the ban on contingency fees argued that it would
not fundamentally change the relationship between lawyers
and their clients.
Managing conflict of interest issues that arise would be well within the
experience and competence of lawyers.
3.47 Charging a contingency fee has elements in common with the existing
practice of charging on a ‘no win, no fee’ basis.
In both instances
lawyers have a financial interest
in the outcome of litigation and could be placed in a position of conflict.41
The extent to which lawyers already have a significant
financial interest in
both funded and unfunded litigation was explained in the submission from Simone
Degeling, Michael Legg and
James Metzger:
Lawyers acting without litigation funding will typically act on a conditional
fee basis, giving them a keen interest in the outcome.
Indeed, with an uplift
fee they have a clear interest in increasing the work they undertake. Where
lawyers are paid by a litigation
funder, so that they are not exposed to the
risk of no recovery if the claim
is unsuccessful, this still involves the lawyers investing their time and
resources in the class action in the hope that they can
carry out the necessary
work so as to earn a fee. Moreover, even when the lawyers are being paid on a
time basis by a funder, they
may receive a success fee, or agree to part of
their fee being held back until a successful outcome is achieved.42
3.48 It is possible that lifting the ban would align the interests of lawyers
and their clients.
Billing for work performed carries an inherent conflict of interest because
the lawyers stand to benefit from maximising the number
of hours worked. When a
contingency fee is charged, there is an incentive to resolve the litigation
without inefficiencies and avoidable
3.49 Finally, Slater and Gordon argued that if lifting the ban were to
intensify conflicts of interest, the combination of lawyers’
professional
and fiduciary obligations and the existing regulatory regime provides
appropriate safeguards against abuse or undesirable
outcomes. Widespread
problems have not emerged in the management of conflicts of interest when legal
costs have been charged on a
‘no win, no fee’ basis. The Victorian
Legal Services Board and Commissioner noted that there have been very few
view that these arrangements operate well, providing ‘substantial
to justice for many consumers of legal services in a manner that is
proportionate and reasonable’.44

42 Submission 9 (Professor Simone Degeling, Associate Professor Michael Legg,

Mundy also suggested that resolving litigation more efficiently
could reduce the
demand on court resources.
44 Submission 10 (Victorian Legal Services Board and
Commissioner).
3.50 Lifting the ban on contingency fees would not mitigate the conflict of
interest issues arising from the practices of litigation
funding. It would shift
the burden of managing them to lawyers who charge contingency fees. In doing so,
it would not relieve litigation
funders of their need to manage conflicts of
interest; nor would it cause the demise of the tripartite relationship in funded
proceedings.
3.51 The Commission is not persuaded that there would be a fundamental change
to the lawyer/client relationship if the ban were lifted.
Charging contingency
fees would be only one option among other billing methods. Among those methods
is the ability to charge on a
‘no win, no fee’ basis, which already
gives lawyers a financial interest, sometimes very significant, in the outcome
of the litigation.
3.52 Concerns about the imbalance of power and information as between the
lawyer and client, in the absence of a litigation funder,
are valid but also
would not be unique to circumstances where contingency fees are charged. The
imbalance is the foundation of the
lawyer’s fiduciary duty to their
client, which flows through the legal and ethical obligations of the legal
profession. In
contrast, the Commission notes that litigation funders tend to
contract out of any fiduciary duty they may have to their clients.
3.53 While lifting the ban might not introduce new conflicts of interest for
lawyers, it would intensify the risks. The financial
incentives presented by
charging contingency fees would be stronger than the prospect of receiving an
uplift fee under a ‘no
win, no fee’ arrangement if the litigation is
successful. The risks borne by the lawyers in the event of an unfavourable
would be greater as well.
3.54 The existing rules and guidelines for the legal profession in managing
conflicts of interest are comprehensive and more robust
than those that apply to
litigation funders. Nevertheless, any decision to lift the ban on contingency
fees should impose limits,
such as on the types of litigation for which
contingency fees may be charged.
3.55 Although the professional obligations on lawyers discourage them from
being excessively entrepreneurial, it is appropriate that
legislation
establishes boundaries specifically to protect clients from excessive legal
costs or unfair contractual arrangements.
This would seek to ensure that the
onus is on lawyers not to cross the line, rather than on the client to seek
redress when they
Response to the terms of reference question
3.56 Removing the prohibition on lawyers charging contingency fees might
mitigate issues that arise with litigation funding practices
but would not
necessarily be a solution to access
to justice and costs issues. The pressure of competition could reduce the
costs in large commercial claims and class actions, although
not many law firms
would have access to sufficient capital to carry the risks of financing
litigation at this end of the market.
Claims that are too small or risky to be a
viable investment for a litigation funder, and where the claimant is unable or
to carry the risk of losing (even if reduced by a law firm charging on
a ‘no win, no fee’ basis), may be able to be pursued.
3.57 The conflicts of interest that exist when a third party is involved in
litigation would not be reduced. Rather, lifting the
ban on contingency fees
would intensify the risk that the lawyer’s financial interest in the
outcome of litigation will prevail
over their duty to their client. However,
lawyers are experienced in managing conflicts of interest and, compared to
litigation funders,
are subject to more extensive rules and obligations and
stronger accountability mechanisms.
3.58 The likely impact of lifting the ban on lawyers charging contingency
fees is uncertain because it would shift the basis on which
commercial decisions
are made in a changing market. The combination of the ban, the costs-shifting
rule and the relatively rare use
‘after the event’ insurance has facilitated the growth of the
litigation funding industry
in Australia.45 Lifting the ban would affect the other two features of the
legal landscape within which lawyers, litigation funders
and insurers make
commercial decisions.
3.59 While the result could improve access to justice and reduce costs,
there is a need to ensure that the community, and the legal
system, are
protected against the potential downside. For example, the cost of litigation
could increase overall if contingency fees
became the default billing method;
vulnerable people could be drawn into pursuing low-value claims for a minor
share of any recovered
amount; clients who are charged a
contingency fee, on the basis that it transfers the financial risk to the
lawyer, could also be charged for ‘after the event’
insurance that
in practice transferred some or all of the risk
to an insurer.
3.60 Problems such as these may not emerge, but whether they will should not
be left in doubt if access to justice may be impeded.
Where existing regulation
does not provide adequate protection, further regulation should be
introduced.
3.61 The Commission considers that the mitigation of issues with litigation
funding practices is not, of itself, a sufficient reason
to remove the
prohibition on lawyers being able to charge contingency fees. The market is
still small and litigation funders are
likely to keep expanding and changing the
services they provide and how they are delivered. Unmet demand for financial
in pursuing low-value claims is not the result of litigation funding
3.62 The policy response to the unmet demand needs to be developed in a wider
context and have broader goals. Lifting the ban on contingency
fees could be
part of that comprehensive policy response, as most recently recommended by the
Productivity Commission following its
wide-ranging review of access to justice
arrangements.
The regulatory controls introduced in this context would focus on the impact
on the community and the justice system generally.
3.63 The need for regulatory controls should not prevent the ban being
lifted. As a matter of principle, the Commission considers
that lawyers should
be able to charge contingency fees because it would provide another funding
option for clients who are unable
to bring proceedings without financial
assistance. In the next section, the Commission recommends that lawyers be able
to apply to
the court to receive a percentage share of any recovered amount,
subject to conditions. Victoria could introduce this reform at its
own pace, as
it would be confined to class actions under
Supreme Court Act
(Vic). It would not remove the ban.
3.64 At the same time, the challenge of how to improve access to justice by
permitting lawyers to charge contingency fees, with appropriate
regulation,
should continue to be pursued nationally. This could be achieved only with the
coordinated leadership of law ministers,
and an appropriate forum would be the
Council of Attorneys-General, which operates under the auspices of the Council
of Australian
Governments.
3.65 The first task would be to develop an agreed strategy to draft model
legislation for the Council’s consideration. This
work could be
undertaken, for example, jointly by Victoria and New South Wales in view of
their shared regulation of the legal profession,
or by the Commonwealth in
connection with its response to the Productivity Commission’s
recommendation on lifting the ban on
contingency fees.

contingency fees may be charged and maintains the current ban in areas where
contingency fees would be inappropriate.
The introduction of contingency fees in class actions
3.66 Independently of any decision to remove the prohibition on lawyers
charging contingency fees nationally, there is scope to improve
justice by permitting lawyers to be
paid a contingency fee in class actions, subject to certain conditions being
met and the supervision of the court.
3.67 Class actions are an appropriate forum for lawyers to absorb the risks
of litigation and be rewarded for this, because the representative
plaintiff has
a disproportionate exposure
to the financial risk of an unfavourable outcome, compared to both the value
of their own claim and the exposure of other class members.
The risk is a
significant disincentive to taking on the role and is only partly mitigated when
lawyers act on a ‘no win, no
fee’ basis.
3.68 In addition, the court has a strong supervisory role in class actions,
particularly at the settlement approval stage, which ensures
that all class
members’ interests are taken into account and includes the power to
approve, and in some circumstances modify,
contractually determined costs.46 The circumstances in which lawyers may be
permitted a percentage share of any recovered amount
can be controlled and
3.69 A further reason to allow for contingency fees for lawyers in class
actions is that it would introduce competition for litigation
funders. As
discussed above, costs to class members could be reduced by paying a single
contingency fee to a law firm rather than
a funding fee to a litigation funder
plus legal costs. However, this is not a relevant consideration
in Victoria because litigation funders tend not to participate in class
actions in this jurisdiction.
3.70 Some guidance about the introduction and control of contingency fees in
class actions may be found in Canadian experience. When
the class action regime
in Ontario was established, contingency fees were introduced to overcome the
financial risks of losing a
class action. Before then, contingency fees were
prohibited. The ban on contingency
fees in other areas of practice was subsequently lifted, except in family and
criminal law matters (where the ban remains). However
the distinction between
class actions and other litigation continues to be recognised.
46 As part of settlement approval, the Court may make such orders as it
thinks fit with respect to the distribution of any money,
including interest,
paid under a settlement or paid into court:
Supreme Court Act 1986
s 33ZV(2). The Federal Court has indicated that under the equivalent section in
the Commonwealth legislation it has the power,
for example, to effectively
modify ‘any contractual bargain dealing with the funding commission
payable out of any settlement
proceeds’ in the course of a settlement

3.71 The Law Society of Ontario has been reviewing the operation of
contingency fees since February 2016 and has recommended a series
of reforms in
litigation other than class actions. It chose not to review contingency fees in
class actions because of the very different
context in which they are charged,
notably the judicial review of legal fees and related third-party funding.47 A
contingency fee
cannot be charged in a class action
in Ontario without court approval, and it will cover all costs: legal costs,
adverse costs risks and disbursements. Increasingly,
judges in Canada prefer to
determine the fee by reference to a percentage of the common fund.48
3.72 While noting that the terms of reference specify that it would be
inappropriate to permit contingency fees to be charged in personal
matters, and agreeing that
the ban should continue for individual personal injury claims, the Commission
does not propose that personal injury claims should
be excluded from the class
actions for which contingency fees may be charged. To do so would prevent this
funding option from being
made available in meritorious mass tort class
Common fund orders
3.73 The proposed mechanism by which contingency fees would be approved and
supervised by the court in class actions in Australia
is a common fund order.
Common fund orders have been made by the Federal Court to allow litigation
funding costs to be shared among
all class members, including those who have not
entered an agreement with the
funder. The percentage amount that the funder receives is subject to approval
or variation by the court. Common fund orders are discussed
in Chapter 5.
3.74 The Commission proposes that the representative plaintiff be permitted
to make an application to the court for a common fund
for a ‘litigation
services’ fee, whereby a
court-approved fee is calculated as a percentage of any recovered amount and
liability for payment is shared among all class members
if the litigation is
successful.49 The litigation services for which the fee is payable would
include legal costs, disbursements
and all costs in connection with indemnifying
the representative plaintiff against adverse costs and responding to a security
costs order if necessary.
3.75 Generally, all class members already contribute to the payment of legal
costs, whether or not they have entered a costs agreement
with the lawyers. When
an ‘all in’ settlement is reached (as opposed to when a separate
amount for legal costs is negotiated),
legal costs, calculated on the basis of
the work done in support of the litigation, are deducted from the settlement
amount before
the class members receive their share.
3.76 The notion that contingency fees should be able to be charged in class
actions, with the approval of the court in each case,
was raised with the
Commission by legal stakeholders and judges. The use of common fund orders for
litigation funding costs in Federal
Court class actions appears to have
enlivened discussion about permitting contingency fees in a similar way.50
Michael Legg raised
the possibility in 2015:
the adoption of a common fund approach for class actions does not have to
coincide with the legalisation of contingency fees more
generally. The class
action is subject to close judicial management and requires court approval of
key steps such as the provision
of notices and approval of settlements.
Extending that approach to lawyers and/or litigation funders’ fees would
(a) facilitate
the class action in achieving its original goals
of access to justice and efficiency while (b) providing essential oversight

49 In practice, an application would be made for the lawyers to be appointed
the funder of the class action, and then orders would
be sought that all class
members are liable to pay the lawyer’s fee for legal services. The lawyer
should not be required to
have a costs agreement in place, to allow an open

(Ross Parsons Centre of Commercial, Corporate and Taxation Law, 2017) 205,
component of the class action regime that impacts the compensation achieved
for group members.51
Conditions of approval
3.77 Approval of a common fund for a ‘litigation services’ fee
would be subject to conditions that protect the representative
plaintiff, and
other class members, from excessive costs. In consulting about whether lifting
the ban on contingency fees would
mitigate issues with litigation funding
practices, the Commission asked stakeholders to identify the measures that
should be taken,
if the ban were lifted, to ensure that the issues were in fact
mitigated. There was a general agreement, from both supporters and
lifting the ban, about what should be required. The most commonly suggested
measures are summarised below.
Adverse costs and security for costs
3.78 A minimum requirement that lawyers who charge contingency fees should
indemnify the representative plaintiff for adverse costs
was widely identified.
Litigation funders argued that the lawyers should be subject to the same
potential liability to pay adverse
costs as they are.52
3.79 The US Chamber Institute for Legal Reform suggested a more flexible
approach, in which the lawyer would be required either to
indemnify the clients
against any adverse costs
or ensure that the client can meet any adverse costs order.53 As the aim of
permitting lawyers to charge contingency fees in class
actions would be to
enable the representative plaintiff to overcome the barrier caused by adverse
costs, the Commission considers
it should be mandatory that the lawyer provide this indemnity.
3.80 Maurice Blackburn stated in its submission that it would support, if
necessary, a requirement that lawyers charging contingency
fees should provide
security for costs if ordered by the court.54 Security for costs is generally
ordered in class actions involving
a litigation funder and the Commission considers that lawyers should
similarly relieve the representative plaintiff of this risk if
they stand to
receive a percentage share of the settlement or judgment amount.
3.81 In Chapter 5 the Commission recommends that the Court have an express
statutory discretion to make a security for costs order
or an order for adverse
costs, taking into account, among other things, factors relevant to access to
justice and the public interest.
Disbursements
3.82 The Commission considers that the contingency fee should cover the costs
of disbursements. These can be significant amounts and
including them in the fee
would ensure that they are closely monitored and contained. As noted above, in
comparing the costs of class
actions funded by litigation funders to what the
outcome would have
been if they had been funded by lawyers on a contingency fee basis, Maurice
Blackburn included the costs of disbursements within the
contingency fee. This
is the practice in Canada when contingency fees are charged.
3.83 If the litigation is successful, the other party is likely to contribute
to the representative plaintiff’s costs of the
proceedings (calculated on
the basis of the work done, as at present). This contribution could be directed
to the lawyers.

Michael Duffy also submitted that lawyers should indemnify

costs: Submission 22.

54 Submission 13 (Maurice Blackburn Lawyers).
Court determination of fee
3.84 The role of the court in determining the amount of the contingency fee
is crucial in controlling costs and the risks of conflicts
of interest. As
Simone Degeling, Michael Legg and James Metzger observed, ‘the main issue
is not embracing contingency fees
but instead the more difficult issue of how to
ensure that fees are charged in an appropriate manner that is fair to both
and client’.55 The court would need to consider whether a
contingency fee is an appropriate billing method in the circumstances,
have the discretion to refuse to approve an application on this basis.
3.85 As has been the practice with common fund applications in the Federal
Court, the applicants would propose a percentage share,
but this would be
subject to review at a later stage of proceedings, most likely at settlement
approval.56 Delaying determination
of the fee until the size of the class is
more certain protects against the lawyers obtaining a windfall profit if the
size of the
class grows beyond expectations.57
3.86 Some submissions called for a cap on the amount of an award that could
be retained by a lawyer, to ensure that a significant
proportion of compensation
awards are paid
to class members. The Consumer Action Law Centre suggested that a cap is
necessary because cost disclosure alone would be unlikely
exploitation. Class members may not understand the information they are given,
or may accept an unreasonably high percentage
fee because they feel that they
have no choice.58
3.87 In proposing that the ban on contingency fees be lifted, the
Productivity Commission recommended that the percentages should
be capped on a
sliding scale for retail clients, with no percentage restrictions for
sophisticated clients.59 It did not recommend
the cap should be. Maurice Blackburn indicated that a cap of 30 to 35 per
cent would be appropriate, reflecting its view that the
introduction of
contingency fees would reduce costs.60 Slater and Gordon suggested 35 to 40 per
cent, noting that this would position
contingency fees in direct competition
with litigation funders.61
3.88 The Commission considers that, as the court would determine the amount
of the fee, a statutory cap is not necessary. It is preferable
for the fee to be
based on the features of the particular class action. If a statutory cap were
imposed, lawyers would be likely
to routinely seek the maximum amount, as they
currently do when they act on a ‘no win, no fee’ basis and claim the
25 per cent uplift. For similar reasons, the Commission does not consider
that caps should be imposed on litigation funding fees.
Transparency
3.89 An advantage of charging a contingency fee is that it is simpler for
class members to understand how the recovered amount will
be apportioned and, as
a result, might
provide greater certainty about costs.62 This does not mean that there would
be less need to be transparent about the terms of the
contingency fee
arrangement, the progress
of the proceedings, and the likelihood of costs arising from the settlement
distribution scheme. The Commission’s recommendations
to improve clarity
of communication with class members are discussed in Chapter 4.

3.90 The need for comprehensive disclosure requirements was raised as an
important issue in submissions and discussions63 and was
recognised by the
Productivity Commission in its recommendation that the ban on contingency fees
be lifted.64
No other fees or costs of the proceeding
3.91 Stakeholders endorsed the recommendation of the Productivity Commission
that lawyers not be permitted to charge other fees, in
addition to the
contingency fee, in connection with the proceedings.65 For example, they would
be unable to charge an hourly rate
for any services they provide in support of
the litigation.
3.92 The Commission agrees and also considers that class members should not
be charged any costs incurred by the lawyers to mitigate
the financial risk of
the litigation. For example, class members should not be required to pay for the
premium on any ‘after
the event’ insurance that the lawyers take out
to cover the adverse costs risk.
3.93 However, settlement distribution costs would be payable separately, in
accordance with the approved settlement distribution scheme.
As there is no risk
involved in the distribution process, legal costs incurred during settlement
distribution would continue to be
charged on the basis of the work completed.
Chapter 5 contains recommendations to strengthen the Court’s ability to
these costs.
Common fund orders for litigation services in Victoria
3.94 Although regulated under state and territory legislation, the legal
profession is progressively being brought under nationally
consistent law.
Lawyers in Victoria and
New South Wales are regulated under the same Legal Profession Uniform Law.
Clearly, a decision that would alter the regulation of
the profession is not one
for Victoria alone.
3.95 The provision concerning contingency fees in Victoria is section 183 of
the Legal Profession Uniform Law, set out in full below.
It does not directly
prohibit lawyers from being paid a contingency fee. Rather, it prevents a law
practice from entering a costs
agreement under which a contingency fee is
(1) A law practice must not enter into a costs agreement under which the
amount payable to the law practice, or any part of that
amount, is calculated by
to the amount of any award or settlement or the value of any property that
may be recovered in any proceedings to which the agreement
Civil penalty: 100 penalty units.
(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to the extent that the costs agreement
adopts an applicable fixed costs legislative provision.
(3) A contravention of subsection (1) by a law practice is capable of
constituting unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional
misconduct on
the part of any principal of the law practice or any legal practitioner
associate or foreign lawyer associate involved
in the contravention.
3.96 The Commission considers that this provision does not prevent lawyers
from being paid a contingency fee in class actions in the
Supreme Court, subject
to the conditions outlined above. This is because:
• The Court may make such orders as it thinks fit about how settlement
money is distributed when approving a settlement.66

Supreme Court Act 1986
Outside settlement
approval, the Court has the power to make any order it thinks appropriate or
necessary to ensure that justice is done in the proceedings:
Supreme Court
• The ability to charge a ‘litigation services’ fee under a
common fund order would not be dependent upon, or require
class members to
enter into, a legal costs agreement specifying a contingency fee. Rather, it
would be determined by, and remain
under the supervision of, the Court.
• Already in Victorian class actions, the payment of legal costs does
not depend upon execution of a legal costs agreement.
If an ‘all in’
settlement is reached, class members will generally contribute to legal costs
whether or not they have
signed a legal costs agreement.
• The legal costs agreement (executed by the representative plaintiff)
would continue to provide for legal costs to be billed
in accordance with the
work performed. It would state that the amount that the lawyers would be paid
would be subject to Court approval
of an application for a ‘litigation
services’ fee.
3.97 The Commission recommends that the
Supreme Court Act
be amended to
provide the Court with the power to make a common fund order for the lawyers who
are acting for the plaintiff to be
paid a percentage of the recovered amount.
Although the Commission does not consider it necessary to do so, the
Profession Uniform Law Application
(Vic) could also be amended to put beyond doubt that the
amendments to the
Supreme Court Act
are not inconsistent with the operation of
the Legal Profession Uniform Law regarding contingency fees.
3.98 The class action regime in Victoria has proved to be an effective means
of providing access to justice but appears to be underutilised.
On average, only
five proceedings have been filed each year.67 The Commission considers that
permitting lawyers to receive a contingency
fee, subject to the conditions
discussed above, is a measured and contained means of ensuring that the class
action regime in Victoria
is meeting the objectives for which it was
established.
Recommendation
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) should be
amended to provide
the Court with the power to order a common fund for a litigation services
fee, on application by a representative plaintiff, whereby
the fee is calculated
as a percentage of any recovered amount and liability for payment is shared by
all class members if the litigation
is successful.
Approval of a common fund of this type should be subject to the following
conditions, set out in legislation or the Supreme Court’s
practice note on
class actions, as appropriate:
(a) An application for the order would be sought from the Court at the
commencement of proceedings.
(b) The percentage allocated for the fee would be indicated when the
application is made but approved by the Court at an appropriate
likely at settlement approval.
(c) The litigation services for which the fee is charged should include:
all services provided by the law firm; provision for security
for costs if
required; disbursements; and an indemnity for adverse costs.

Class actions and
access to justice
70 Introduction
71 Class actions in Victoria
73 Improving efficiency in class actions
90 Strengthening accountability in class actions
4. Class actions and access to justice
Introduction
4.1 Class actions create economies of scale that make it financially viable
to take legal action against a well-resourced defendant,
such as a government
agency or large corporation, to recover a small loss. By grouping individual
claims from the same, similar or
related circumstances, the cost of bringing
proceedings can be spread across many claimants.
4.2 In this way, class actions have provided access to justice to thousands
of Australians who otherwise would not have pursued a
legal remedy because of
the cost. For claimants who could have taken separate legal action, class
actions have offered cost savings.
4.3 Class actions also reduce costs to defendants and the courts. Defendants
are able to respond to multiple claims in one proceeding,
saving the cost of
separate proceedings.
The burden on court resources is reduced by having fewer proceedings filed,
although the intensive case management often required,
and the court’s
role in supervising settlement approval, can be onerous.
4.4 In short, the fundamental advantage of class actions, compared to
separate proceedings, is that they are more efficient. A disadvantage
most class members have limited contact with the lawyers acting in proceedings
and incomplete information about the cost,
progress and likely outcome of the
proceedings. This is inevitable because the lawyers cannot establish and
maintain with all class
members the degree of contact that they have with the
representative plaintiff.
4.5 The terms of reference ask the Commission to report on a number of reform
to ensure that class members are not exposed to unfair risks and
disproportionate cost burdens. The Commission’s task is not
to investigate
whether class members are being treated unfairly or overcharged but to consider
how to prevent these problems occurring.
In doing so, the Commission has
identified reforms that contribute to three broad objectives.
Improving efficiency.
Measures that reduce delay and complexity
also reduce costs. Although flexibility should be retained, there is a need for
and parameters that avoid, where possible, procedural and legal
uncertainties that take time to resolve and add to the cost burdens
both defendants and plaintiffs. Proposals to improve efficiency by making the
Supreme Court of Victoria’s powers and
expectations clearer are discussed
in this chapter.
Strengthening accountability.
Class action lawyers have duties to
all class members, not just those that have signed a legal retainer. The Court
ensures that the
interests of the whole class are taken into account in
approving settlement
or concluding a trial. Improving the means by which lawyers (and, through
litigation funders) are accountable to class members and the court reduces
the risk of an unfair outcome. In this chapter, particular
attention is given to
greater transparency and better reporting obligations.
Controlling costs
. Proposals to directly control legal and funding
costs, and how they are shared, to protect class members from disproportionate
burdens, are discussed in Chapter 5.
4.6 As noted in Chapter 1, the consensus conveyed to the Commission in
submissions and during consultations is that Australia’s
class action
regimes are generally working well, and that a particular strength that they
have in common is the flexibility available
to the courts in how they manage
proceedings. The reforms suggested by the terms of reference, and by
contributors to the review,
have been considered in that context.
4.7 Some reforms discussed in this chapter recommend legislative amendments
to give the Court power, or specify its existing discretionary
relation to certain matters. In making these recommendations, the Commission
recognises that the Court, under part
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) and the
Civil Procedure Act
(Vic), already has broad powers in class actions. However, recognising
a specific power in legislation is desirable in some circumstances
to underpin
best practice and provide a clear source of power where this may not yet be
determined.
4.8 While a number of its recommendations aim to ensure that Victorian class
action law and practice are consistent with other Australian
class action
regimes, the Commission is mindful that the types of class action filed in each
to which they involve litigation
funders. These differences have influenced the practices and jurisprudence
arising from each jurisdiction,
and are important when considering reform
options in Victoria. They are discussed in the next section.
Class actions in Victoria
4.9 The 85 class actions filed in the Supreme Court since the class actions
regime commenced under
Supreme Court Act 1986
represent an average of between four and five each year, though the numbers have
fluctuated between zero and 16. Five were filed
4.10 Approximately two-thirds of Victorian class actions have settled,
resulting in the distribution of at least one billion dollars
to more than
28,300 class members.2 The two largest-ever class action settlements in
Australia were secured under Victoria’s
class action regime.3
4.11 In terms of the number and variety of cases managed, Victoria’s
class action regime is second only to the Commonwealth’s.
The Federal
Court manages the most active class action regime in Australia and, having been
established in 1992, it is also the longest
established. By 31 May 2017, 402
class actions had been filed in the Federal Court,4 and at least $3.5 billion
had been paid by defendants
pursuant to judicially approved settlements.5

4.13 The differences in the types of class actions filed are significant. The
Supreme Court has dealt with far more mass tort claims
than the Federal Court,
and continues to do so. The proportion of shareholder class actions filed in
each jurisdiction is similar,
but the last one filed in the Supreme Court was in
April 2015.
4.14 Meanwhile, there has been a marked increase over the past five years in
the number of shareholder claims being filed nationally,
mainly in the Federal
4.15 Although 25 investor claims have been filed in the Supreme
Court—equal to the number of mass tort claims—16 of them
in response to the collapse of plantations group Great Southern.8 An investor
class action has not been filed in the
Supreme Court since May 2016. There was a
surge in the number of class actions of this type being filed in the Federal
Court after
the global financial crisis of 2008. The number is now falling.9
4.16 A further point of difference between the two jurisdictions is in the
way proceedings are funded. As discussed in Chapter 2,
litigation funders have
been involved in only 10 class actions filed in the Supreme Court—11 per
cent of the total. Four of
them were transferred to the Federal Court.10
4.17 Litigation funders are far more frequently involved in class actions in
the Federal Court, where they have been involved in 26
per cent of all class
actions. In the last five years, more than half of all Federal Court class
actions have been financed by a
litigation funder.11
4.18 These differences are reflected in the procedural and legal developments
in each of the regimes.

Regimes, Fifth Report: The First Twenty-Five Years of Class Actions in
(July 2017) 33.
4.19 In Victoria, class actions are allocated between the Commercial Court
and the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court. The Common
Law Division
manages proceedings founded, or concurrently run, in tort and breach of contract
or statute. The Commercial Court hears
cases of a commercial nature. In the
Federal Court, class actions are allocated to a Docket Judge within the
appropriate National
Practice Area.
4.20 The Federal Court practice note on class actions provides detailed
procedural guidance regarding the involvement of litigation
funders; the
equivalent Supreme Court practice note on class actions does not refer to
litigation funders at all.
4.21 Compared to the Federal Court Practice Note, the Supreme Court Practice
Note is less prescriptive, which allows for the flexibility
needed in mass tort
claims. Mass tort claims are complex to manage and the harm suffered by
claimants is unique to the circumstances
of the case and difficult to assess.
Procedural guidelines that can be applied across all mass tort proceedings need
to be more adaptable
to the particular features
of the claims than, for example, investor and shareholder class actions,
where there is greater comparability of type and cause of
loss (financial)
between proceedings.
4.22 Because of the relative prevalence of funded litigation in its
procedure around the court’s role in supervising litigation funding fees.
An example is the Federal Court’s approval
of common fund orders, which
allow litigation funders to obtain a court-approved funding fee from every
registered class member,
regardless of contractual arrangement.12
4.23 In the Supreme Court, settlement distribution, which is the process by
which class members’ individual claims are assessed
and distributed, has
presented a greater challenge. Settlement distribution in mass tort class
actions is likely to be lengthy, and
can account for approximately half the duration of proceedings. In
comparison, it is likely to account for approximately a fifth of
the duration of
proceedings in shareholder class actions.13
4.24 While it is important to recognise the differences between
class action
regime benefits from sharing a common procedural form. As discussed in Chapter
1, it is desirable that innovations
continue to develop in a consistent manner
across jurisdictions rather than creating, or appearing
to create, arbitrary distinctions. Many of the reforms discussed in this
chapter respond to innovations by the Federal Court that
have not yet been
applicable to class actions in the Supreme Court. However, they may be relevant
in the future, not only to the
management of class actions in Victoria but to the decisions made by lawyers
Improving efficiency in class actions
4.25 The efficiencies that can be achieved by class actions, as compared to
multiple individual claims, were highlighted in the 1988
Australian Law Reform
Commission (ALRC) report on grouped proceedings, which led to the introduction
of class actions in the Federal
Court: economies in the use of Court and legal
resources; greater fairness for defendants; and time and cost savings for class
At the same time, the ALRC acknowledged
that these efficiencies would not be realised if the procedure was used
inappropriately, and it considered that enabling the Court
to take an active
role in case management would help prevent this possibility:

Proceedings in the Federal Court
, Report No 46 (1988).
Grouped proceedings will sometimes be more complex and difficult to manage
than other forms of litigation. The Court’s ability
to control proceedings
through directions hearings and taking a more active role in the management of
the case will help to ensure
that the costs incurred by the parties are less
than the cost which would be incurred if the proceedings were all conducted as
proceedings.15
4.26 Since the introduction of the Victorian regime in 2000, the Supreme
Court of Victoria
has demonstrated its willingness to actively supervise class actions to
ensure not only that they are run efficiently, but also that
the class action
mechanism is not abused or used improperly.16 Many of the case management
techniques adopted by the Court to enhance
efficiencies are set out in the
Supreme Court Practice Note.
4.27 While the Supreme Court Practice Note preserves the Court’s
flexibility in managing different types of class actions efficiently,
differential case management is a reactive process that is time- and
resource-intensive for both the courts and the parties. Ultimately,
parties pay
the increased legal costs that arise from this more intensive management of
proceedings.
4.28 Some types of class action may benefit from a more standardised,
structured process.
Comments were made in consultations and submissions about four areas of
possible reform:
Certification
. It has been suggested that Victoria adopt
certification requirements such as those that apply in class actions overseas.
As a pre-trial
process, certification requires the court, and the parties, to
turn their minds to procedural issues, including questions of efficiency,
before a class action is commenced. Certification is identified in the
Commission’s terms of reference as a possible reform.17
Powers of the Court under
section 33N.
Instead of providing
for a certification process, Victoria’s class action regime empowers the
Court to discontinue a class action
in a range of circumstances under
Supreme Court Act
. An expansion of the Court’s powers under
this section may give greater support to achieving the regime’s efficiency
Multiple class actions.
Multiple class actions reduce
efficiencies by increasing the burden on Court and defendant resources. A more
formal approach to managing
multiple class actions that are filed about the same
subject matter has been proposed.
Settlement distribution
. Settlement distribution can be a
lengthy and expensive process, yet it has been given little attention in
research to date.18 An
increased emphasis on efficiency during settlement
distribution, particularly in mass tort class actions, is considered
4.29 These issues are discussed in the sections that follow. In considering
the need for reform, it is important to acknowledge that
improving efficiency in
class actions is not only
a matter of court procedure. Innovations in technology allow courts, and
parties, to streamline processes and significantly enhance
efficiencies in large
and complex litigations. Some of these innovations, such as electronic
settlement distribution, have already
been adopted in overseas jurisdictions,
and may be relevant in Australian class actions in the future. The impact of new
on class actions is discussed in Chapter 6.

Melbourne City Investments Pty Ltd v Myer Holdings Ltd

(20 July 2017).
17 The terms of reference direct the Commission to examine whether a
certification requirement should be introduced in respect of
class actions
‘and similar proceedings that involve a number of disputants being
represented by an intermediary’. As
discussed in Ch 2, there are important
differences between class actions, where the representative plaintiff is not
appointed by
the class members and is not an agent or an intermediary for them,
and other representative proceedings, where the intermediary is
appointed on
behalf of the participants,
and is directly answerable to them. In the latter case, issues that
certification aims to address, such as the adequacy of the representative
plaintiff and the satisfaction of threshold issues, are not relevant. The
Commission considers there is no need to investigate the
introduction of
certification in these proceedings.

Certification
Current law
4.30 The certification of class actions is a formal process of obtaining
court approval for a class action to commence. It requires
a representative
plaintiff to prove to the court, at a pre-commencement hearing, that certain
preliminary criteria have been met
and that the proceeding should commence as a
class action.
4.31 Class actions in Australia do not include a certification process19
because the ALRC concluded, after considered deliberations,
that certification
does not protect parties or ensure efficiency:
Class actions, like all litigation, are open to abuse. Because of the
potential numbers involved and the fact that many group members
may be absent,
specific safeguards have been built into the Commission’s recommended
procedure to protect the interests of
both group members and respondents. In the
light of the recommended safeguards, the Commission sees no value in imposing an
costly procedure [certification], with a strong risk of appeals
involving further delay and expense, which will not achieve the aims
protecting parties or ensuring efficiency.20
4.32 Instead of certification, a number of procedural factors influence how,
and when, a class action is commenced.21
4.33 In Victoria, the claim must satisfy threshold requirements contained in
section 33C
Supreme Court Act
, which must be set out in a writ in accordance with
section 33H.
Parties must also comply with the overarching obligations set out
Civil Procedure Act 2010
(Vic), which stipulate, among other
things, that claims must have a proper basis and not be frivolous, vexatious or
an abuse of process.22
4.34 If the class action is properly constituted according to the threshold
requirements, the
Court still has the ability to prevent it from continuing as a class action
under section
Supreme Court Act
Section 33N
gives the Court the power to order
that a proceeding no longer continue as a class action in a range of
circumstances where that
is in the interests of justice.23
4.35 The Supreme Court also has access to traditional remedies to terminate a
proceeding, such as those provided under the
Supreme Court (General Civil
Procedure) Rules 2015
4.36 As reiterated throughout the Commission’s consultations, a
nationally consistent approach to class actions is desirable.
Any changes to
the way that class actions are commenced
in Victoria, including the introduction of certification, could create an
incentive to
‘forum shop’ if not introduced on a national basis.24 Several
submissions highlighted the importance of national consistency
in class action
practice, including those calling for certification. Ashurst observed that
introducing certification in only one
class action
Chamber Institute submitted that it is critical that
any proposed reform
options are ultimately considered for implementation at a national level;
Litigation Lending put the view that,
without compelling reasons to do
otherwise in a particular jurisdiction, harmonisation of laws across Australia
should be encouraged.25
19 While South Australia does not have a statutory class action regime, its
rules for representative proceedings require that representative
parties apply
to the Supreme Court for an order authorising the action to be maintained as a
representative action within a specified

4.37 The Commission notes that reviews of the civil justice system since the
1988 ALRC report have not called for a certification
procedure in class actions.
These reviews include the ALRC’s review of the federal civil justice
system in 2000,26 the VLRC’s
review of the Victorian civil justice system
in 2008,27 the report by the Access to Justice Taskforce of
the Commonwealth Attorney-General’s Department in 2009,28 and the
report of the
Australian Productivity Commission on access to justice arrangements in
Proposal to introduce certification
4.38 Supporters of certification consider that pre-commencement judicial
approval of class actions promotes efficiencies and reduces
unmeritorious class
actions. The US Chamber Institute for Legal Reform submitted that the absence of
some form of initial certification
by Australian courts has led to vague and
imprecise class definitions, the filing of unsuitable class actions, and the
of competing class actions.30
4.39 Simone Degeling, Michael Legg and James Metzger submitted that a
certification process should be introduced in Victorian class
actions. They
identified several advantages:
• The representative plaintiff, who has the best knowledge of the
proposed action, would be required to justify the proceedings,
thereby enhancing
efficiency.
• By requiring certain procedural matters to be addressed upfront, it
would ensure that problems are identified early, avoiding
the costs and delays
associated with interlocutory challenges and responding amendments.
• It would provide a dedicated forum for addressing the adequacy of the
representative plaintiff, the claims of competing class
actions, and issues
associated with litigation funding that need to be determined at an early stage
of proceedings.31
4.40 Similarly, the Insurance Council of Australia supported certification as
a means of addressing threshold criteria and efficiency
issues, including the
suitability of representative plaintiffs, poorly pleaded class actions,
competing class actions, and the
use of closed class actions.32 Ashurst indicated that it could also be a
useful mechanism to consider the capital adequacy of the
funder of the class
4.41 The substantial majority of submissions did not support the introduction
of a formal certification process, or higher threshold
requirements, into
Victoria’s class action
regime.34 They identified the following primary reasons for opposing
certification: the lack of evidence that the current provisions
insufficient in preventing unsuitable claims being filed; the costs and delay
evident in overseas jurisdictions which have implemented
certification; and the
barriers it creates to accessing justice. These issues are discussed in turn

Submission 22 (Dr Michael Duffy) suggested that the issue should
be monitored
and reviewed in the future. Submission 12 (Allens) did not support a formal
certification regime, however, it supported
upfront scrutiny of the appropriateness of class actions.
Risk of unsuitable claims
4.42 Proponents of certification view it as an effective means of reducing
the number of unsuitable class actions filed in Australia.35
Vince Morabito
submitted that there is a lack of evidence, empirical or otherwise, to indicate
that the current provisions of
Supreme Court Act
operate unfairly
for defendants or are open to abuse by plaintiffs:
Only a handful of class actions has been put forward as evidence of
systematic abuse and, with all due respect, all that these cases
evidence that the type of certification device that is being advocated is one
pursuant to which a mini-trial, with respect
to the merits of the substantive
claims, is to take place.36
4.43 The Supreme Court submitted that none of the judges who have
regularly handled class actions believe there is any need for
amending the
commencement criteria contained in
of the Supreme Court Act.37
4.44 Moreover, the legal and procedural devices that are already available to
the Court give
it sufficient power to maximise procedural efficiencies and prevent
unmeritorious claims from progressing.38 Vince Morabito observed
powers under
provide the Court with greater powers to determine which
proceedings should be conducted as class actions than courts which have
power to withhold certification orders.39
4.45 Within
, these powers include the power to discontinue
proceedings as a class action
(section 33N)
; the power to order that individual
issues or issues not common to the class be addressed through the use of
sub-groups or by individual
determination (sections
33Q and 33R); and the power to make any order necessary to ensure that
justice is done in proceedings
(section 33ZF).
Proceedings must also meet
specific threshold criteria (sections
33C and 33H), and a representative plaintiff must satisfy certain criteria
and can be substituted upon application by class members
if inadequate
4.46 Outside
, the Court has the power under the Supreme Court Rules
Civil Procedure Act
to dismiss a proceeding, or make any other order it
considers appropriate in the interests of justice where there is an abuse of
process or no proper basis for the proceeding.40 Judicial case management
ensures that proceedings are closely supervised and monitored.
Moreover, the
operation of the costs-shifting rule acts as a deterrent to commencing
frivolous, vexatious or otherwise inappropriate
proceedings.41
4.47 Finally, as Vince Morabito has observed, the fact that not many class
actions have been filed in the Supreme Court in the last
five years suggests the
need to explore
why the regime is so little used rather than how to make class actions more
difficult to commence.42
Costs and delay
4.48 Although none of the proponents of certification suggested that Victoria
fully replicate overseas practice (which, as noted
in one submission, may be
evolving and improving),43 the experience of jurisdictions that have adopted
certification is informative.

4.49 The Commission was told that, rather than reducing cost and delay,
certification increases it.44 An example from Canada, which
has adopted
certification in class actions, was provided by Andrew Roman, a lawyer consulted
as part of the ALRC’s 1988 report
on grouped proceedings. He highlighted
the huge costs and delays involved in certification, which often mean that the
law firm or
funder will run out of time and money and class members will be left
without a remedy:
If an opinion polling company was to ask class members whether they would
prefer their interest to be protected in this manner [through
certification],
increasing the risk that they get nothing at all, I would think that most of
them would say ‘No thank you,
I risk nothing by being a member of the
class, so don’t protect me by destroying the economics of those who are
prepared to
assume that risk’.45
4.50 Preparation for a certification hearing (which is often converted into a
mini-trial) requires parties to undertake discovery
and gather evidence. This
is a time-consuming procedure which can result in millions of dollars being
spent in legal costs and the
creation of a financial barrier to access to
justice at the very outset.46 In the United States, significant class action
are used in the certification process, as certification is primarily
used for the purposes of implementing, on a class wide basis,
the settlement
agreement reached between the parties.47
4.51 The Commission considers that there is a risk that the introduction of a
certification requirement would cause significant complexity,
cost and delay in
the conduct of litigation.
4.52 Increasing the time and financial barriers faced by the class when
commencing a class action not only makes justice less accessible
costly,48 but also goes against the trend of recent judicial reform to reduce
pre-trial complexity.49
Barriers to justice
4.53 Because of the costs and delay, it was argued in submissions that
certification creates an uphill battle for class members and
the representative
plaintiff when commencing a class action, while providing no discernible benefit
to them.50 It was also suggested
that introducing certification would reduce the
4.54 It was submitted that, in Canada, class actions with an aggregate value
of less than $20 million are unlikely to be brought,
due to the significant
costs of certification.51 In the United States, certification criteria such as
predominance (requiring that
questions of
law or fact common to class members predominate over any individual
questions) are less likely to be satisfied in class actions where
individualised damage has been suffered. This means that individuals with
product liability and mass tort claims who have
suffered personal injury, for
example, may be left without a remedy.52

Other ways of improving efficiency at the early stages of
proceedings
4.55 Although strongly opposing certification, participants in consultations
during the review expressed support for greater ‘upfront’
supervision by the Court of issues relevant to
the conduct of class actions: conflicts of interest, funding arrangements,
and adequacy of representation.53 To the extent that these
issues can usefully
be addressed early in proceedings, the Commission supports reforms that ensure
this occurs.54
4.56 Proposals to strengthen the Supreme Court of Victoria’s powers to
address issues about the conduct of class actions, from
the earliest stages and
throughout the proceedings,
are made in this report. Recommendations to improve the information given to
the Court at the commencement of proceedings are discussed
in Chapter 2.
Recommendations to increase the Court’s power to discontinue a class
action, remove a representative plaintiff
of its own motion, and manage
competing class actions are discussed later in this chapter.
4.57 Although certification may appear to be a simple means of ensuring that
only appropriate claims are conducted as class actions,
there is no need to
introduce it to Victoria’s class action regime, and many reasons not to do
4.58 It would not improve access to justice; rather, it would inhibit it by
exacerbating pre-trial complexities and increasing costs
and delays. The Court
has sufficient powers to manage class actions efficiently and prevent
unmeritorious or otherwise unsuitable
class actions from progressing.
4.59 The Commission does not support its introduction in Victoria.
Recommendation
A certification requirement should not be introduced in Victorian
class actions.
Court’s own motion power under section 33N
4.60 The ALRC recognised that the class action regime it proposed in 1988
would need to contain safeguards that allow a proceeding
to be discontinued as a
class action, where appropriate. It identified the importance of a defendant
having the right to challenge
the validity of a class action, and the Federal
Court’s own motion power in certain
circumstances, including the power to discontinue proceedings as a class
action where it is not cost-effective to run the proceedings
4.61 Section 33N of the
Federal Court Act 1976
(Cth) gives broad
effect to the ALRC’s intention. It empowers the Federal Court, upon
application by the defendant or of its
own motion, to order that proceedings no
longer continue as a class action if it is in the interests of justice to do so
• costs would be likely to exceed those that would be incurred in
separate proceedings
53 Roundtables 2, 3 (professional stakeholders).
54 While the Commission considers it desirable that issues relevant to the
conduct of class actions be addressed early in proceedings,
this is not always
possible. For example, the Commission was told that it is uncommon for conflicts
of interest to become evident,
or crystallise, until settlement approval. It is
at settlement approval that financial interests, and any conflicts between the
financial interests of the class members, the lawyers and the
litigation funders, will become evident. Prior to this, it is difficult
identify or address these or
other conflicts which may only emerge only after detailed exchange of
evidence or commencement of settlement discussions: Consultation
2 (Judges of the Federal Court of Australia).

• the relief sought can be obtained without resort to a class
• the class action is not an efficient and effective means of dealing
with the claims
• it is otherwise inappropriate that the claims be pursued by means of
a class action.56
section 33N
Supreme Court Act
is very similar to the
Federal Court equivalent, it does not expressly give the Court an own motion
power to discontinue a class
action in the specified circumstances. Rather, the
defendant has to make an
application. In the interests of consistency across jurisdictions, to
strengthen the powers of the Court, and to give full effect
to recommendations
of the ALRC in its 1988 report, the Commission recommends that
section 33N
amended to make the power available on the Court’s own motion.
4.63 Most submissions indicated that, if an own motion power were introduced
in Victorian class actions, the circumstances in which
the Court can discontinue
a class action under
section 33N
are sufficient to prevent inefficient,
unsuitable, or inappropriate claims from continuing.57 Developments in case law
have largely
resolved concerns expressed in older commentary about the excessive
section 33N
by defendants.58 Commentators who raised concerns about
section 33N
years ago, and used this as a basis for recommending
certification, told the Commission that the low use of
section 33N
contemporary class actions has changed their view.
section 33N
, a proceeding can be discontinued as a class action if
it is not ‘an efficient and effective means’ of dealing with class
members’ claims. Allens suggested that amending the legislation to allow a
class action to be discontinued if it is not the
‘most efficient and effective means’ of dealing with the claims
would give better effect to the regime’s efficiency
Currently, a class action will be allowed to proceed if it is an efficient or
effective means of dealing with the claim of group members.
This means that an
action may be allowed to continue despite the existence of a compensation
scheme, appropriate low cost or
no cost tribunals or other mechanisms available to effectively deal with
group members’
4.65 While a class action may not be the most efficient method of resolving
the claims of class members, it provides access to justice
for individuals who
would otherwise be unable to pursue a remedy. Accordingly, the Commission
considers the existing efficiency threshold
contained in
section 33N
appropriate.

Efficiency and multiple class actions
4.66 The risk that multiple actions will be commenced against a defendant in
respect of the same subject matter is inherent to Australia’s
class action regimes: class members have the freedom to opt out of a class
action and bring a separate individual proceeding
or another class action
against the defendant, should they wish.60
4.67 The filing of multiple class actions relating to the same subject
matter appears to be an increasing trend in Australia.61
Commonly cited reasons
for this trend include: increased legal entrepreneurialism; the establishment of
class action regimes in
more jurisdictions; and the use of closed classes, which
restrict proceedings to a particular category of class members.
4.68 It is not yet clear how common fund orders will affect the number and
subject matter. Data
collected by Vince Morabito indicates that fewer closed class actions have been
filed since the Federal Court
approved common fund orders for litigation funding
4.69 Multiple class actions can be filed for a range of reasons and in a
range of circumstances, and may involve proceedings in which:
• there is an overlap in class membership
• the classes are different but the subject matter of the litigation is
• the subject matter of the litigation is the same, but one commences
after an earlier one has concluded.63
4.70 Courts actively case-manage the proceedings when multiple class actions
are filed, and may make a range of orders to enhance
efficiencies and minimise
duplication of work. For example, the court may direct the proceedings to be
heard before the same judge,
make orders that the respondent is only exposed to
one set of legal costs, or appoint an independent lawyer to monitor the work
and resources deployed in proceedings and report to the court on a regular
4.71 Class actions that involve overlapping class membership, or the same or
substantially similar subject matter, are particularly
problematic for courts to
manage and have been the focus of proposed reforms. They are referred to as
competing class actions in
the following discussion.
Competing class actions
4.72 The Federal Court has observed that competing class actions increase
legal costs and delays, waste court resources, and are unfair
to defendants.65
Ultimately, the additional legal costs incurred as a result of intensive case
management, lengthy negotiation
between competing proceedings, and achieving a
more difficult settlement are borne by class members.
60 An individual’s ability to bring another class action against the
defendant depends on satisfaction of threshold criteria
under part 4A, including
the requirement that there be seven or more persons in the subsequent class
action with the same, similar
or related claims. The extent to which class
members, who do not opt out, will be estopped from pursuing claims not pleaded
class action has been the subject of recent litigation: see, eg,
Timbercorp Finance Pty Ltd (in liq) v Collins
[2016] FCA 44
(2016) 259 CLR 212.
61 Submission 12 (Allens).
62 In the five years preceding the decision in
Money Max Int Pty Ltd v QBE
Insurance Group Ltd
[2016] FCAFC 148
(2016) 245 FCR 191
) (26 October
2011 to 25 October 2016), 48% of funded Federal Court class actions used a
closed class mechanism. In the seven months after
, 23% of the
funded class actions employed closed classes: Vince Morabito,
An Empirical
Study of Australia’s Class Action Regimes, Fifth Report: The First
Twenty-Five Years of Class Actions in Australia
(July 2017) 39– 41.
This trend, however, cannot be attributed to the approval of common fund orders
alone; a downward trend

4.73 Although the courts may not allow competing class actions to proceed in
that form as long as there continues to be an overlap
in class membership, there
is no fixed rule as to how the issue should be addressed. In
McKay Super
Solutions Pty Ltd (Trustee) v Bellamy’s Australia Ltd
(Bellamy’s)
, Justice Jonathan Beach held that there were five
realistic options available to him where two open class actions with almost a
overlap in class membership were filed:
• order the competing class actions be consolidated
• order a permanent stay of one proceeding
• declass one or more proceedings under section 33N
• order that one class be closed, and the other proceeding remain open,
with a joint trial of both
• allow both proceedings to remain constituted as open class
proceedings and order a joint trial of both.66
4.74 Other options available for addressing competing class actions may
include ordering sequential hearings, or selecting one proceeding
to continue as
a ‘test case’, with a temporary stay of the other proceedings until
the test case is resolved.67
4.75 Although it appears that courts have the power to permanently stay one
or more proceedings, they are reluctant to ‘pick
a winner’ or set a
fixed rule that no more than one class action can proceed in these
circumstances.
4.76 The reasons for this reluctance are twofold. First, if the threshold
requirements for commencing a class action are met, a class
the right to proceed (unless a declassing or decertification order is
made). Preventing one class action from continuing under part
4A because another
proceeding involving the same claim or cause of action is commenced may
interfere with this right, and there
must be a powerful and significant reason
for this.68
4.77 Secondly, the right of class members to choose their desired litigation
funder and law firm, and not have this choice determined
through judicial
election, enhances freedom of contract.69 As observed by Vicki Waye, this view
is held despite scant evidence that
competing class actions have driven down the
cost of funding or led to significant improvements in funding terms.70
4.78 To date, competing class actions have not been a problem in Victoria.71
It is reasonable to suggest, however, that factors contributing
to the filing
of multiple class actions will continue to develop, and may lead to competing
class actions in Victoria in future.
It is desirable that Victoria examine the
issue in conjunction with the Commonwealth and the other states which have a
class action
4.79 The consultation paper asked whether reform is necessary to assist the
Court in addressing competing class actions. Responses
considered whether
legislative or procedural guidance should be introduced in the Victorian scheme,
which is discussed below.

situation is different in jurisdictions that have adopted certification in class

representative plaintiff to apply for a ‘carriage motion’ seeking a
stay of all other class actions relating to the

informative in Australia, it is not a direct analogue: [54]. It has also been

New guidance for the Court to address competing class actions
4.80 Although the Federal Court has found it has the requisite power to
permanently stay
one or more competing class actions and allow one to continue, the source of
the power has not yet been determined by an appellate
court. Certainty could be
created through introducing a legislative power to appoint one class action.
4.81 Submissions expressed different views as to whether a legislative power
is necessary, or desirable. Some supported the idea,
although they differed as
to whether this power should be mandated or discretionary, and whether it should
be part of a certification
requirement in Victoria or introduced under existing
provisions.72 Other submissions
did not consider legislative reform necessary; rather, they thought it might
hinder the flexibility of the Supreme Court to craft
responses best suited to
the circumstances of the case.73
4.82 A related suggestion was that some form of non-exhaustive guidance for
the Court when dealing with competing class actions would
provide certainty and
promote efficiency, provided it is not overly prescriptive.74 Several
submissions highlighted issues that
be considered in preparing any guidance or checklist: Maurice Blackburn
submitted that it should respect class members’ choice
representation and funding arrangements;75 Litigation Funding Solutions
submitted that it should avoid promoting judicial
consideration of some factors,
such as lowest cost, over others;76 and Ashurst suggested that it should state
that the timing of
filing is not a relevant factor, except in certain
circumstances.77
4.83 The Federal Court, in two recent decisions, has reiterated the
importance of a tailored approach to competing class actions.
, Justice Beach determined that the appropriate course of
action where two competing open class actions had arisen was to close one
and try the cases together. He indicated, however, that had the facts been
different and significant numbers of class members
not signed agreements with
litigation funders and law firms in each proceeding, it would have been
appropriate to permanently stay
one proceeding.78
4.84 A different approach was taken by Justice Foster in
Cantor v Audi
Australia (No 2)
, where two proceedings were filed by different law firms.
There was some overlap in class definition between the proceedings. Justice
Foster determined that they should be allowed to continue in parallel and tried
together.79
4.85 Given the case-dependent approach adopted by the courts to date,80 the
Commission does not consider it necessary to give the
Court express legislative
power to choose one class action when competing proceedings are filed. It would
be unlikely to provide
any real change to practice, and may risk a ‘one
size fits all’ approach being adopted, which the Federal Court has

kept under constant review as the litigation progressed:

4.86 It is desirable, however, that there is consistency in judicial
approaches to competing class actions.82 The Commission believes
that it would
be useful for the Supreme Court Practice Note to include a non-exhaustive list
of factors that the Court may consider
where competing class actions are filed.
This guidance should reflect current practice, while also allowing the Court to
flexibly in the circumstances of each case.
Justice Beach set out a range of
non-exhaustive factors that were relevant to his choice as to which proceeding
should be closed,
and which should remain open. These factors could provide a
framework for any guidance included in the Supreme Court Practice Note.
• the experience of the lawyers bringing the class actions
• the costs the lawyers expect to charge for the work performed
• the funding terms in each of the proceedings, including funding terms
and conditions and percentages
• the resources made available by each law firm, and their
accessibility to clients
• the state of preparation of the proceedings (relevant but not
determinative if both proceedings will be ready for trial at
the same time)
• the number of class members signed up to each of the proceedings
• whether each of the proceedings would proceed without a common fund
order, and the terms of any proposed common fund order
that might be sought
• the position adopted by each funder on the question of security for
costs and generally their resources to meet any adverse
costs order.83
4.88 In the interests of promoting flexibility in the Supreme Court of
Victoria’s approach to competing class actions,
the Commission considers
that any guidance should stipulate that the Court may take into account any
other matter as it considers
Recommendation
The Supreme Court should consider amending its practice note on
class actions to include guidance for the Court and parties on managing
competing class actions. The guidance should reflect current practice, as it has
developed over time, and allow for the Court to
respond flexibly in the
circumstances of each case.
Cross-vesting of multiple class actions
4.89 Although the consultation paper did not seek responses on the issue, the
Commission’s consultations revealed that reform
is necessary to improve
the cross-vesting capabilities of Australian courts where multiple class actions
are filed in different jurisdictions.84
82 See, eg,
Cantor v Audi Australia (No 2)

criteria is contained in the Federal Court’s case management handbook:

(2014) 120 –21. Submission 12 (Allens) also set out a list of factors
that could be considered by the courts when faced with
competing class
84 Roundtable 2 (professional stakeholders); Consultation 2 (Judges of the
Federal Court of Australia). The issue has also been raised
in commentary. See,
eg, Justice Bernard Murphy and Vince Morabito, ‘The First 25 Years: Has
the Class Action Regime Hit the
Mark on Access
to Justice?’ in Damian Grave and Helen Mould (eds),
25 Years of

Commercial,

4.90 Under the
the Supreme Court has the power to cross-vest proceedings between jurisdictions.
There was agreement among stakeholders, however,
that existing cross-vesting
powers, both in Victoria and nationally, are not adequate to ensure efficient
cooperation between state
and federal jurisdictions where multiple class actions
arise.85 The consensus view was summarised by Vince Morabito:
competing class actions are rapidly becoming a ‘national’ problem
and cannot therefore be adequately addressed by the
legislatures or courts of
class action jurisdictions acting on their own.86
4.91 The decision to cross-vest a case is made by the court.87 Judges are
able to ‘push’ cases to another court, but are
‘pull’ cases to their own court. This prevents the undesirable
situation in which large class actions are pulled
to the court with the most
resources. However, it also restricts the courts’ powers to enhance
efficiencies and minimise duplication
of work and expense.88
4.92 Allens expressed concern that, as a matter of practice, the onus is
generally placed on the defendant to pursue cross-vesting
orders, which
increases cost and time burdens.89 It also increases the risk that the defendant
will ‘forum shop’ and
choose a jurisdiction, or court, that is to
their advantage in the proceedings.90
4.93 Allens thought it preferable that the courts instead be required to
proactively consider and determine which action should be
transferred to another
same judge.91
4.94 There was widespread support, including among judges of the Federal
Court, for the establishment of a cross-vesting judicial
panel to address the
concerns relating to class actions.92 The role of this panel would be to make
cross-vesting decisions where
multiple class actions relating to the same
subject matter are filed in different jurisdictions. It was envisaged that it
would prevent
one court having ultimate authority on cross-vesting decisions,
while at the same time ensuring that the appointed court had the
expertise and
resources to be able to hear the multiple proceedings.
United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
4.95 The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL Panel), which
transfers cases between federal districts in the United States,
was put forward
as a possible model upon which to base a cross-vesting panel in Australia.93
The MDL Panel is a statutory body that
considers motions for coordinated or
consolidated pre-trial proceedings in federal cases.94 While
the MDL Panel has no power over cases pending in state courts, it facilitates
coordination by transferring federal cases to a district
where related cases are
pending in the state courts.95
4.96 The purpose of the MDL Panel is twofold: it considers whether common
questions of fact exist between proceedings filed in different
districts, such that centralisation of
the pre-trial process will promote the just and efficient conduct of the
proceedings; and it determines which federal district and
judge are best
situated to handle the transferred matters.96

4.97 The MDL Panel exercises considerable and largely unfettered discretion
in its decisions to coordinate or consolidate pre-trial
proceedings. Decisions
are made by the seven sitting federal judges who are appointed to the panel (no
two panel members being from
the same federal circuit), and it convenes hearings
in various locations around the country to facilitate the participation of
and their counsel.97
4.98 The Commission recommends further investigation into the operation of
the MDL Panel and the viability of establishing a similar
panel in Australia,
with the ability to cross-vest class actions between federal and state
that such a panel, consisting of a
senior judge from each jurisdiction with a statutory class action regime, would
be of significant
value in mitigating the existing cross-vesting difficulties
and in strengthening a nationally consistent approach to class actions.
Legislation would need to be developed, to establish the panel, determine its
powers and how they should be exercised, and clarify
how it would operate. The
appropriate forum to undertake this task is the Council of Attorneys-General,
which will doubtless consult
with the Council of Chief Justices of Australia and
New Zealand in relation to any proposals.
Recommendation
The Attorney-General of Victoria should propose to the Council of
Attorneys- General that a cross-vesting judicial panel for class
established. The judicial panel would make decisions regarding the
cross-vesting of class actions, where multiple class
actions relating to the
same subject matter or cause of action are filed in different

part of settlement approval, the Court will approve the process by which
class members’ settlement payments are to be assessed
and distributed
(known as the settlement distribution scheme). The representative
plaintiff’s lawyers are required to submit
evidence to the Court
explaining the broad contours of the settlement distribution scheme, including
how it will be administered,
supervised, monitored or audited.98
4.101 Settlement distribution can account for a significant part of
proceedings, particularly in large mass tort class actions. Although
size and scale, the Kilmore East/Kinglake bushfires class action provides an
example of the possible complexity of settlement
distribution: the trial lasted
16 months, followed by a settlement distribution process of close to two
years.99 Ensuring that the
settlement distribution process is carried out as
efficiently and effectively as possible is critical in ensuring class members
obtain a fair outcome, and are not unduly delayed in obtaining compensation for
their damage or loss.

Practice Note SC Gen 10—Conduct of
Group Proceedings (Class Actions)
, 30 January 2017, [13.5].
99 The settlement distribution process for personal injury claims was just
under two years; for property claims, it took two years
and two months: Rebecca
Gilsenan and Michael Legg, ‘Settlement Distribution Schemes’ (Speech
delivered at the IMF Bentham
and UNSW Class
Action Conference, Sydney, 1 June 2017).
4.102 The Commission asked in the consultation paper how the management of
settlement distribution schemes could be improved. The
responses observed that
the best approach depends on the type of class action, the complexities of the
claims involved, and the capabilities
of the appointed scheme administrator.
These issues are discussed in the section below.
4.103 The accountability of the scheme administrator to the Court was also
raised as an important issue during the Commission’s
consultations, and is
discussed at [4.191] – [4.217]. For ease of reference, all the
Commission’s recommendations relating
to settlement distribution,
including those relating to efficiency, are included at the end of those
paragraphs.
Trade-off between precision of assessment and efficiency
4.104 As set out in the consultation paper and recognised in submissions,
there are two objectives of settlement distribution schemes.
First, individual
compensation in a class action should reflect the merits of each individual
claim; and secondly, the distribution
process should be completed in a manner
that minimises cost and delay.100
4.105 The type of class action and the damage being assessed during
settlement distribution will determine whether a trade-off is
required between
the two objectives. In a product liability, personal injury, or mass tort class
action, for example, the damage
is likely to
be highly complex, both in itself, and in comparison with the claims of
others. The need to assess each class member’s claim
individually will
result in higher costs and a longer distribution process. Essentially, a
trade-off is required between the first
objective (the precision of individual
assessment) and the second objective (minimisation of costs and delays).
4.106 In a shareholder class action, the tension between the precision of
individual assessment and efficiency is not as keenly felt.
members’ loss is of the same kind— financial—it can often be
assessed according to a formulaic loss assessment.
Settlement distribution can
generally be completed within three to six months.101
4.107 Even where the damages are diverse and complex, highly individualised
assessments are unlikely to be desirable because of the
detrimental effect of
the cost on the settlement amount as a whole, and the time required. This was
observed by Maurice Blackburn:
in the context of a class action settlement scheme, it will almost never be
appropriate to obtain this full suite of expert evidence
because it will not
only add significantly (and unreasonably) to the costs of administering the
settlement, thereby detracting from
the overall amount that is available for distribution to group members, but
will also add substantially to the time that it takes
to assess all claims under
the settlement scheme.102
4.108 Where settlement distribution is unreasonably delayed, Allens
suggested that, upon application by the legal profession’s
sanctions should be imposed against persons responsible.103
4.109 While the Commission recognises the expertise of the Victorian Legal
Services Commissioner in handling complaints regarding
lawyers, introducing
another avenue for complaint may simply prolong settlement distribution for
class members. Instead,
allowing the Court to be involved in serious disputes arising from settlement
distribution is a more efficient option. Recommendation
17 seeks to strengthen
the role of the Court in resolving these disputes.

4.110 How the balance is achieved between precision of individual assessment
and the minimisation of cost and delay is ultimately
a factor for the Court to
consider when approving a settlement,104 and it is important that it is
provided with the necessary information
to undertake this assessment. To assist
the Court, the Commission recommends that information about the proposed
measures being taken
during settlement distribution to minimise costs and ensure
a fair outcome, be provided to the Court at settlement approval (Recommendation
Innovations developed during settlement distribution
4.111 Where settlement distribution requires highly individualised damages to
be assessed, scheme administrators have been innovative
in improving the
efficiency of distribution. Examples of these innovations include:
• The use of interim distributions as part of global sum settlements.
In some class actions, the settlement distribution scheme
may provide the scheme
administrator with the discretion to make interim distributions to class members
whose claims have been completed,
once a certain proportion of claims have been
assessed. This may
be desirable where the settlement distribution is likely to be lengthy. For
example, in the Kilmore East/Kinglake bushfires class
action, the settlement
distribution
scheme provided for interim distributions after 30 per cent of the personal
injury and dependency claims or 40 per cent of the economic
loss and property
damage claims had been made.105 The risk of interim distributions is that they
may further delay the settlement
distribution,106 or may be too high, in which
case the funds available for later payments will be diminished.
• The use of hardship payments, which allow for partial payment of
settlement money where class members are facing financial
hardship. Again, this
may be useful where the settlement distribution is likely to be long and
• The use of fast-track payments, where class members can elect to
accept a fixed
sum of compensation (at the lower end of the scale) in order to avoid a
slower, more detailed and more expensive individualised assessment.107
the class member waives the right to a more rigorous individual assessment of
the merits of their claim, they are able
to obtain prompt (and certain) payment
and avoid a potentially invasive and time-consuming individual assessment
process. A fast-track
payment system
may be most attractive to class members who have not suffered significant
loss or damage.108
• The use of matrix or grid settlements, which ascribe certain sums to
different experiences, based on a matrix of criteria.
A matrix settlement
involves use of a general formula, whereby a base payment is provided for each
class member, with additional
pre-set amounts deducted depending upon the number
of criteria met. Although used in the United States, matrix settlement
distributions
do not appear to be widely used in Australia.109 While they
provide certainty for class members during settlement distribution,
loss or damage may not be fully compensated due to the formulaic nature of
assessment.110

4.112 Several of the Commission’s recommendations are expected to
encourage scheme administrators to be innovative in distributing
settlements
efficiently as well as fairly. For example, the Commission recommends below that
they be required to inform the Court
receive settlement amounts. This
may encourage consideration, from the outset, about how to address, and
implement, efficiencies during settlement distribution.
Appointing third-party administrators for settlement distribution
4.113 The law firm acting for the representative plaintiff will generally,
but not always, be appointed as the scheme administrator
for the settlement
distribution. As the lawyers involved in the case generally know the most about
class members’ claims, this
appointment makes sense on the grounds of
efficiency. If experienced in class action litigation, the lawyers will be able
on expertise and knowledge in this area, and apply the most efficient
method for assessment and distribution of claims.
4.114 However, Allens, IMF Bentham and healthcare companies and businesses
proposed that, in some circumstances, it would be preferable
to appoint a
third-party scheme administrator.111 IMF Bentham suggested that the courts
should consider appointing an administrator
rather than the lawyers who
conducted the action when:
• the settlement distribution would be likely to be conducted at less
cost and more quickly
• it is unnecessary to have lawyers, at lawyers’ rates,
undertake an administrative function
• the lawyers are likely to be less efficient than an administrator
with more relevant expertise
• all that is required is the application of the court-approved scheme
and there is little merit in having lawyers with the
factual and legal knowledge
implement the scheme
• the lawyers are likely to largely outsource the calculation or
determination of merits in any event
• the lawyers do not have any particular expertise in the application
of formulas or claim assessment used in the settlement
distribution
4.115 Actual, and perceived, objectivity during settlement distribution is
important. Settlement distribution is a separate part of
proceedings that does
not always require legal expertise. Class members may perceive a decision to
appoint the representative plaintiff’s
lawyers to administer the
settlement as an opportunity for the lawyers to ‘double dip’.113
4.116 The expertise that a third-party scheme administrator would need to
bring would depend upon the circumstances of the case. In
the Kilmore
East/Kinglake bushfires class action, some class members suggested that a firm
of accountants should be appointed as
scheme administrator. Justice Forrest
observed (extra-judicially) that it was unlikely that such a firm would have
been able to carry
out the task at a lower cost than the representative
plaintiff’s lawyers.114
4.117 Subject to the availability of resources, an option for administering
settlement distributions in smaller, less complex class
actions could be to
utilise the expertise of Funds in Court. Funds in Court is an office of the
Supreme Court which administers all
funds paid into court in civil proceedings.
As such, it has significant expertise in managing and distributing funds in
with Court orders. During the 2016–17 financial year, Funds in
Court was responsible for $1.7 billion of funds under management.115

interact with large client groups efficiently.
The Commission considers that its
recommendations to improve the information given to the Court about the
settlement distribution
scheme will reinforce the need for the representative
plaintiff’s lawyers to assess alternative service delivery methods when
identifying the appropriate scheme administrator.
Strengthening accountability in class actions
4.119 The extent to which class members’ interests can be affected when
a class action is brought has altered since Australia’s
first class action
regime commenced in the Federal Court in 1992. In designing the model, the ALRC
envisaged a largely passive role
for class members, where they were not required
to do anything if they wished to participate in proceedings. The ALRC
recommended
that a class member be required to take active steps only if they
wished to exclude themself from proceedings.116
4.120 Thirty years later, class members’ interests can be adversely
affected by remaining passive in a class action. As a consequence
of the class
member registration process, now typically included as part of opt-out, class
members who fail to register by the
stipulated date may be bound by the outcome
of proceedings but excluded from obtaining a share of any money recovered. If a
fund order is made for the payment of a litigation funding fee,
registered class members who have not signed a funding agreement
may nonetheless
be required to pay the fee. In one class action, the representative
plaintiff’s application for a common fund
order proposed that class
members who had not signed the funding agreement would pay the funder a higher
percentage of their share
than those who had signed the agreement.117 In
another, class members who did not pay security for costs, or who did not
a reasonable reason for failing to do so, were excluded from obtaining
any benefit in the proceeding or under any settlement.118
4.121 These developments, combined with the representative nature of class
actions, make
it crucial that the lawyers acting for the representative plaintiff, the
litigation funder (if involved) and the representative plaintiff
are accountable
to the court and class members for the impact that the conduct and funding of
proceedings has on class members’
interests. The supervisory role of the
court at settlement approval, which ensures that all class members’
interests are taken
into account, also reduces the risk of unfair outcomes for
class members.
4.122 Reform options were put forward during the Commission’s
consultations and in submissions to reduce the risk that class
interests are exposed to unfair outcomes in class actions. They included:
• improving the accountability of the representative plaintiff’s
lawyers to class members
• ensuring the representative plaintiff adequately represents class
members, and that they are supported in the role
• strengthening the role of the Supreme Court at settlement
• enhancing the ability of the Court to supervise settlement
distribution, where necessary
• improving communication with class members.
4.123 These reform options, and the recommendations made by the Commission in
relation to them, are discussed in turn below.

Lawyers’ obligations to class members
Conflict of interest
4.124 In a class action, the law firm acting for the representative plaintiff
will generally run proceedings on behalf of the entire
class. The representative
plaintiff will sign a legal retainer and costs agreement with the law firm,
although many class members
will not. Regardless, class action lawyers have
responsibilities to the class that do not depend on contractual agreement, and
apply in both funded and unfunded proceedings.
4.125 These wide-ranging responsibilities are not specific to class actions,
but arise from the broader obligations imposed upon lawyers.
They include
fiduciary responsibilities owing to the nature of the solicitor–client
relationship, and professional obligations
under the Legal Profession Uniform
Law. Lawyers have fundamental duties to the Court and the administration of
justice, and must
comply with the overarching obligations contained in the
Civil Procedure Act 2010
Vic).119 They also have significant
responsibilities that relate to the disclosure, and charging, of legal costs,
which are discussed
in Chapters 2 and 3.
4.126 The complexities of class action litigation create particular
challenges for lawyers when there is conflict of class members’
There may be differences between the interests of the representative plaintiff
when compared to class members, as well
as between the class members
themselves. These differences may arise due to the different nature of the claim
or the harm suffered;
from the different categories of class members (for
example, whether funded or unfunded);120 or from the structure of the class
mechanism, in which the representative plaintiff has responsibilities
that class members do not share.
4.127 Views differ about the extent and significance of the conflict. Simone
Degeling and Michael Legg have argued that there is a
substantial’ possibility that lawyers conducting the class action will be
exposed to conflicts of interest between
the competing needs of the different
class members.121 Phi Finney McDonald put forward the opposite view, suggesting
highly unusual for lawyers acting for several class members to find
that their obligations to those class members conflict because
members will, in most cases and on most issues, have the same or similar
interests given the nature of a properly constituted
proceeding’.122
4.128 There was agreement that some aspects of proceedings are more prone to
conflict than others. For example, where settlement distribution
involves class
members with different claims, conflicts of interest might be expected to
arise.123 Allens observed that less obvious
conflicts can arise throughout
proceedings, not just at settlement distribution:
For instance, conflicts may arise at the start of proceedings, when plaintiff
lawyers frame the issues in dispute in the statement
of claim, and during the
course of proceedings, when the representative plaintiff’s lawyers may
have to make a decision about
whether to amend application, and about which
claims to pursue or abandon.124
4.129 In addition, there is conflict between the law firm’s commercial
interests and the interests of all class members at the
settlement of a class
action. Like other forms of litigation, while the lawyers have a justified
financial interest in receiving
payment from any settlement amount, the legal
costs will necessarily reduce the amount available for class members. If acting
a ‘no win, no fee’ basis, the law firm stands to lose a
significant amount if the class action is unsuccessful, and conflict
in determining when, and for how much, class actions settle. Conflict of this
nature is inherent in the provision

as funded /unfunded can be reduced by making a common

is a significant
4.130 Conflicts may be exacerbated in funded class actions, where a
tripartite relationship is created between the lawyer, funder
and representative
plaintiff (or other class member who signs the funding agreement). Although
funding agreements will generally
reiterate that the lawyers’ duties to
their clients prevail over those to the funder, in practice the funder can have
deal of control over the day-to-day conduct of proceedings.
4.131 Without obtaining the client’s full and informed consent, a
lawyer cannot continue to
act for clients where these, or other, conflicts of interest arise, or where
there is a real or substantial possibility of a conflict
of interest. Unlike
single client litigation, obtaining full and informed consent from class members
to continue acting in this capacity
is virtually impossible in a class
Guidance for lawyers
4.132 Submissions expressed divided opinions as to whether guidance for
lawyers to address these conflicts of interest, either in
legislation or Court
guidelines, is necessary. Many suggested that prescriptive rules are unnecessary
in view of the Court’s
inherent jurisdiction and powers under the
Procedure Act
to respond to issues as they arise, and lawyers’ existing
professional obligations. In addition, the Australian Securities
and Investments
Commission’s regulatory guide on managing conflicts of interest in funded
proceedings, and the Victorian Legal
Services Commissioner’s powers (which
for disciplinary intervention where necessary), were identified as adequate
regulatory controls.125 It was observed that introducing
additional guidelines
in Victoria could result in lawyers being obliged to meet two sets of applicable
standards, with confusing
or overlapping obligations.126
4.133 Other submissions indicated that further guidance could be useful
because of the complexity of acting for multiple class members
and as the limits
of existing obligations are unclear.127 Simone Degeling, Michael Legg and James
Metzger proposed that, as a minimum,
lawyers should be educated about the
fiduciary duties that may be owed to the entire class, and how these duties
arise. This education
could include guidance from professional bodies or the
4.134 The Victorian Legal Services Board and Commissioner suggested that the
legal profession consider introducing specialist accreditation
in class action
litigation. As well as assisting
in quality assurance and expertise development, accreditation would help
raise awareness among newer, inexperienced law firms of the
complexities
involved in class action litigation. As accreditation provides a clear way for
consumers to readily identify expert
lawyers, it may also help class members
choose between different law firms where competing class actions arise.129
4.135 Allens, the Law Council of Australia, Maurice Blackburn and Phi Finney
McDonald proposed looking to the courts for guidance.130
It was suggested that
the Supreme Court Practice Note incorporate the conflict of interest guidelines
for lawyers that are set out
in the Federal Court Practice Note. These
guidelines state that:
• Legal costs agreements should include provision for managing
conflicts of interest between the applicant(s), the class members,
applicant’s lawyers, and any litigation funder.

• Lawyers have a continuing obligation to recognise and properly manage
any such conflicts throughout proceedings.131
4.136 Other ideas put forward were to expand the Law Institute of
Victoria’s guidelines on conflicts of interest (to include
guidance for
lawyers acting in class actions) or the commentary for the conduct rules under
the Legal Profession Uniform Law (to
specifically mention potential conflicts of
interest in class actions).132
4.137 The Commission considers that formal, and specific, guidance for
lawyers acting in class actions is desirable. Measures should
be put in place to
ensure lawyers do not run class actions in a manner that adversely affects the
interests of class members. The
need for guidance has long been recognised. In
its 2000 report on managing justice, the ALRC recommended that the legal
develop professional practice rules governing lawyers’
responsibilities to multiple claimants and in class actions.133 It is
important today, in view of increasing legal entrepreneurialism and the entrance
of new and inexperienced law firms into
class action litigation.134
4.138 Although there are intricacies involved in producing conduct guidelines
under the Legal Profession Uniform Law, the Commission
considers that the
complexity of issues involved in class actions and the real lack of guidance for
lawyers acting in this capacity
render formal guidance necessary. As New South
Wales also has a class action regime, it is appropriate, for reasons of
consistency,
that the guidelines be applicable to all lawyers
to whom the Legal Profession Uniform Law applies: namely, lawyers in New
South Wales and Victoria. Under the Legal Profession Uniform
Law, the Standing
Committee, comprising the Attorneys-General of Victoria and New South Wales, can
request the Legal Services Council
to produce the guidance. The Legal Services
Council makes
Uniform Rules and can issue guidelines or directions to local authorities
(state-based Legal
Services Commissioners and professional bodies).
4.139 While the Commission’s recommendation is directed to ensuring
that conduct guidelines are produced by the Legal Services
Council, the local
authorities in Victoria may consider
it desirable in the meantime to produce conflict of interest guidelines for
Victorian lawyers acting in class actions.
Recommendation
The Attorney-General of Victoria should seek the agreement of the
Attorney- General of New South Wales that:
(a) guidelines should be issued to legal practitioners on their duties and
responsibilities to all class members in class actions,
providing specific
direction on the recognition, avoidance and management of conflicts of
(b) the Standing Committee under the Legal Profession Uniform Law should
ask the Legal Services Council to ensure that such guidelines
are produced and
promulgated.

Litigation funders’ obligations to class members
4.140 Litigation funders involved in class actions are likely to have little,
if any, direct engagement with class members. Some
class members may choose, or
be required, to execute a funding agreement when participating in a class
action, although the increased
use of a common fund for the payment of funding
fees will make this less likely.
4.141 As discussed in Chapter 2, litigation funders are required to have
processes in place to manage conflicts of interest. Otherwise,
the Commission
considers that the lawyers acting for the representative plaintiff are best
placed to ensure that class members and
the courts are aware of the involvement
of a litigation funder in proceedings, including the impact of any fees or
charges on amounts.
Recommendations to improve the transparency of litigation
funding arrangements in class actions are contained in Chapter 2.
Representative plaintiff’s obligations to class members
Adequacy of representation
4.142 In the absence of a certification requirement, the representative
plaintiff need not demonstrate that they are able to adequately
represent class
members, or that their personal claim is reflective of the common questions to
be determined in the class action.135
4.143 However, as recognised in many submissions, the Court has powers under
Supreme Court Act
which allow it to address issues relating to
the adequacy of the representative plaintiff, where required.136 These powers
section 33N
, which allows a proceeding to be discontinued as a class
action if it is inappropriate that it continue
section 33T
, which enables class members to apply for the
substitution of an inadequate representative plaintiff
sections 33Q
, which provide for sub-groups and individual
questions, to ensure that all class members’ claims are addressed in
proceedings
section 33ZF
, which gives the Court the broad power to make any order
to ensure that justice is done in proceedings.137
4.144 The Commission’s consultations suggested that adequacy of
representation is not a systemic issue in Victorian class actions.138
suggestion is reinforced by empirical data collected by Vince Morabito. His
submission referred to two class actions commenced
in the Supreme Court:
Cohen v The State of Victoria (No 2)
Matthews v SPI Electricity
Pty Ltd (Ruling No 1)
in which the representative plaintiffs had not
provided their consent to act in that role.139 He argued that two instances does
constitute sufficient evidence of a systemic problem.140
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) contains little
specific guidance as to what an ‘adequate’ representative plaintiff
looks like.
The representative plaintiff must have a sufficient interest to be able to
commence the proceedings on their own behalf:
While the representative
plaintiff is not required to prove that their personal claim is reflective of
the common questions to be
determined in the class action, the statement of
claim should be drawn so that their personal claim can be used as a vehicle for
determining the common questions in the action: Supreme Court of Victoria,

Class Representatives: Empirical
Insights from Down Under’ (2012)
Windsor Yearbook of Access to Justice
4.145 Not all submissions considered adequacy of representation to be
sufficiently addressed under
of the Supreme Court Act.141 Simone
Degeling, Michael Legg and James Metzger argued that introducing an adequacy
requirement would
reduce the risk of conflicts of interest between the
representative plaintiff and class members, while Allens submitted that it would
ensure that the common issues addressed by the representative plaintiff’s
claim resolve all class members’ claims.142
Recommendations to
an adequacy requirement were generally made in conjunction with calls to
introduce certification.143 As outlined above, the Commission
does not support
the introduction of certification in Victoria.
4.146 Requiring a representative plaintiff to prove they adequately represent
the class would create further scope for interlocutory
disputes and the
associated costs and delay. It could also increase the disincentives for class
members to take on this role, which
are already significant.144 The Commission
does not support additional burdens, or disincentives,
being placed on the role of representative plaintiff.
Own motion power for the Court to replace a representative
4.147 Currently, the Court has power to substitute a representative plaintiff
under section
Supreme Court Act
when a class member applies for this to happen.
The Commission considers that the Court should have the express power to remove
an inadequate representative plaintiff of its own motion. The following reasons
in support of the idea were highlighted in submissions:
• The utility of the existing power is doubtful. Allens stated that it
is unaware of any instances of
section 33T
being used.145
• An own motion power would be in keeping with the Court’s
supervisory role in class actions.146 Although the Court already
powers under
sections 33N
33ZF of the
Supreme Court Act
, an own motion power would allow a
representative plaintiff and their lawyers to be replaced, without discontinuing
proceedings,
where deemed appropriate by the Court.
• It would be consistent with the recommendations of the ALRC in its
1988 report on grouped proceedings. The ALRC observed
that, in order to manage
a class action properly, the Court should have the power to replace the
representative plaintiff of its
own motion.147
• It would recognise the important role of the representative plaintiff
in ensuring class members’ interests are protected,
without placing
additional burdens or disincentives upon the representative plaintiff. The
importance of this role has been recognised
in the New South Wales and Queensland class action regimes. These regimes
give the courts the power, upon application of the defendant
or of its own
motion, to discontinue a class action where the representative plaintiff does
not adequately represent the class members.148
4.148 For these reasons, the Commission is of the view that
section 33T
Supreme Court Act
should be amended to give the Court the power to
replace a representative plaintiff of its own motion, where necessary.

Recommendation
Section 33T
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) should be
amended to empower the Court, of its own motion, to substitute another class
member as representative plaintiff,
and make other such orders as it thinks fit,
if it appears that the representative plaintiff is unable to adequately
represent the
interests of class members.
Onerous role of representative plaintiff
4.149 The role of the representative plaintiff in a class action is a
demanding one. As discussed in Chapter 5, class members are
able to enjoy
immunity from costs orders because this burden is placed solely on the
representative plaintiff. In a large class action,
these costs orders will run
into the millions of dollars.
4.150 Although the representative plaintiff is not appointed by class
members, and is not their agent or intermediary, they have responsibility
the conduct of proceedings on behalf
of class members. The ALRC, in its 1988 report suggested that there is a
fiduciary element to the role of the representative plaintiff
which requires
them to act in the interests of
class members.149
4.151 A representative plaintiff may face intense pressure from class
members, and the general public, about the progress and outcomes
action. The Commission was told there can be a misapprehension about the role of
the representative plaintiff in a class
action. Class members may believe that
the representative plaintiff is being paid by the law firm, or that their role
submissions on behalf of individual class members to the law firm or
scheme administrators about the conduct of the proceedings.150
The public forum
of class actions means that intense media scrutiny of proceedings, and the
representative plaintiff, is common.
4.152 These obligations—combined with the significant investment of
emotion and time that is required—mean that the appointment
representative plaintiff who adequately represents the class members can be a
difficult task. The Commission was told that,
due to the significant financial
risks involved, corporate entities are reluctant to be appointed as
representative plaintiff in
Australian class actions.151
4.153 Some of the disincentives to acting in the role of representative
plaintiff can be mitigated by altering the cost burdens and
risks involved in
this role. This is discussed in Chapter 5.
4.154 Other disincentives can be mitigated by ensuring that the
representative plaintiff, and other class members, are adequately
informed about
the role. Providing standardised and clear information to all class members
of the representative plaintiff
would assist class members who are considering whether to accept the role of
representative plaintiff.
With a clearer understanding that the representative
plaintiff is not their agent, class members would also be less likely to place
undue pressure on the person who takes on the role.
4.155 The Commission considers that the law firm acting for the
representative plaintiff is best placed to provide this information
members. It recommends that the representative plaintiff’s lawyers
provide this and other key information to them,
and the Court, at the start of
proceedings (Recommendation 23).

Court approval of settlement
4.156 Court supervision is essential to safeguard participants in class
actions from unfair risks and disproportionate cost burdens.
Supreme Court Act
mandates Court supervision at various points of proceedings,
one of which is settlement.152 In order to have legal effect, a class
settlement must be approved by the Court.153
4.157 Because of the representative nature of class actions, where class
members do not appear before the court, the Court’s
supervisory role at
settlement approval is a particularly onerous one. This was observed by the
Federal Court in
Australian Securities and Investments Commission v
The role of the court [at settlement approval] is important and onerous. It
is protective. It assumes a role akin to that of a guardian,
not unlike the role
a court assumes when approving infant compromises. In the current context, the
Court’s role is to protect
those group members who are not represented by
[the representative plaintiff’s lawyers] and whose interests may be
by their absence.154
4.158 Not only is the Court’s role at settlement approval onerous, it
is also regularly called upon in class actions. Like many
other forms of civil
litigation, settlement is the most common means of resolving a class action,
especially in Victoria,155 and
is encouraged by the Court.156
4.159 The Court’s principal task is to assess whether the settlement is
a fair and reasonable outcome for class members considered
as a whole, not just
for the representative plaintiff and the defendant. The ALRC recommended in its
1988 report on grouped proceedings
that factors for the Federal Court to
consider when approving a settlement should be
set out in legislation.157 However, the recommendation has not been
implemented in any class action jurisdiction in Australia, including
4.160 On the one hand, the absence of statutory guidance enables the courts
to exercise discretion in an innovative and appropriate
manner according to the
peculiar challenges of each settlement approval. On the other, it increases the
risk that case law will be
applied in a piecemeal or inconsistent fashion, and
that parties will be unsure about
the requirements of settlement. As directed by the terms of reference, the
Commission has examined whether there should be specified
criteria for the
Court’s approval of a settlement under
section 33V
Supreme Court
. Its recommendations are set out in the following section.
4.161 The role of the Court at settlement approval is particularly difficult
due to the adversarial void that exists when both sides
have become
‘friends of the deal’.158 The appointment
of a contradictor, and a greater role for parties and class members were
raised during consultations and in submissions as means of
assisting the Court
in this context. They are discussed in turn below.
4.162 Settlement approval is only the first phase of settlement. The second
phase, settlement distribution, is discussed at [4.191]
152 The Court must also fix the opt-out date and approve the formal notices
sent to class members:

Settlement approval under section 33V
4.163 As recognised by the Supreme Court, the process of settlement under
section 33V has evolved over time, and ‘has grown
in sophistication due to
the need to adapt to complex scenarios’.159 The principles guiding
settlement approval, and criteria
relevant to the Court’s decision, are
discussed below.
Settlement approval principles
4.164 The principles that govern the exercise of the Court’s power to
approve a proposed settlement have developed through case
law and are now well
established. They were recently set out by Justice Emerton in
Ausnet Electricity Services Pty Ltd
,160 and are also included in the
Supreme Court Practice Note. They require the Court to consider whether the
proposed settlement
• fair and reasonable as between the parties having regard to the
claims of the class members
• in the interests of class members as a whole and not just in the
interests of the representative plaintiff and the defendant.161
4.165 The courts have indicated that these principles must be applied in a
flexible manner.
There will rarely be one single or obvious way in which a settlement should
be framed, either between the claimants and the defendants
or in relation to
sharing the recovered amounts between class members. Reasonableness is a range,
and the relevant question is whether
the proposed settlement sum, and the
proposed distribution of that sum between class members, falls within that
4.166 Further, this assessment does not involve guessing or interpreting the
tactical decisions made by the representative plaintiff’s
lawyers. Rather,
the Court’s role is to satisfy itself that the decisions are within the
reasonable range of decisions, having
regard to the known, and reasonably
knowable, risks and circumstances.163
Settlement approval criteria
4.167 In assessing whether the proposed settlement falls within the range of
fair and reasonable outcomes, the Court will consider
a number of criteria which
have also developed
through case law. They are now set out, on a non-exhaustive basis, in the
Supreme Court
Practice Note.164 These criteria include:
• the complexity and likely duration of the litigation
• the reaction of the group to the settlement
• the stage of the proceedings
• the likelihood of establishing liability
• the likelihood of establishing loss or damage
• the risks of maintaining a class action
• the ability of the defendant to withstand a greater judgment
• the range of reasonableness of the settlement in light of the best

Legislative guidance
4.168 The Court’s flexibility is a particular strength of
Victoria’s class action regime. It is important that this flexibility
maintained when the Court is evaluating the fairness and reasonableness of a
settlement, and that it uses this flexibility in
an appropriate manner.166
4.169 Allens commented on the demonstrated ability of the Supreme Court to
settlements in the interests of class members, and the importance of not
limiting its ability to consider circumstantial factors:
In our view, given the preparedness of courts to scrutinise settlement terms
in the class actions context, the Court should not be
constrained in the
criteria relevant to evaluating the reasonableness of a class action settlement.
In particular, it is important
that the Court is able to take into account the
facts of the case, the circumstances of the group members and the nature of the
arrangement.167
4.170 The Supreme Court stated that the criteria for settlement approval do
not require a formulaic recitation in legislation.168
A similar view has been
expressed in case law, where the courts have reiterated that the settlement
approval criteria, while providing
a useful guide, are neither mandatory or
exhaustive, nor do they supplant a detailed analysis of the particular facts in
each proceeding.169
4.171 It is expected that new matters which are relevant to the approval of a
settlement will continue to arise in response to developments
in class action
practice, as well as broader developments in the legal and litigation funding
industries. As Slater and Gordon stated,
it is important that courts have scope
to consider emerging factors when approving a settlement:
In this way, as new factors which are relevant to the court’s
assessments arise – for example, the advent of litigation
– courts in future decisions can adopt an approach to considering whether
to approve a settlement which reflect
such changes in the class action
landscape.170
4.172 An example is the issue of costs. The settlement approval criteria
listed above do not refer to legal costs, or any litigation
funding costs. As
discussed in Chapter 5, court scrutiny
of costs is an important part of settlement approval and, in relation to
litigation funding costs, is a rapidly developing one. Retaining
flexibility in
the settlement approval criteria has enabled the courts to recognise that, if
applicable, the court should consider
the legal costs and any litigation
funder’s fee in its analysis of whether settlement is fair and
reasonable.171
4.173 Given the continually evolving nature of settlement approval
jurisprudence, particularly on the matter of costs, the Commission
that there are more effective mechanisms to strengthen the Court’s role at
settlement approval than legislative recitation
of settlement approval criteria.
These mechanisms are discussed throughout the report, and include:
• introducing guidance for the appointment of contradictors at
settlement approval and in settlement distribution
• improving the ability of class members to object to settlement

• increasing the accountability of the scheme administrator to the
• introducing a legislative power for the Court to review and vary all
costs of proceedings.
4.174 These reforms avoid the risk that the Court will be constrained in
considering the unique circumstances of each proposed settlement,
or in adopting
case law developments to the process of settlement approval. At the same time,
they strengthen the ability of the
Court to ensure that settlement is fair and
reasonable, and in the interests of class members as a whole.
4.175 While there was little support for recognising the settlement approval
criteria in
legislation, and cogent reasons to avoid this, there are more compelling
reasons to include the broader settlement approval principles
in legislation.
Simone Degeling, Michael Legg and James Metzger submitted that legislative
guidance would ensure that the well- established
principles from case law are
given due consideration by the Court in every case.172 It could also play an
important educative role
for the public generally, and in particular for class
members, as to how the Court will approach settlement.173
4.176 For this reason, the Commission recommends including the settlement
approval principles in legislation, while retaining
the settlement criteria in
the practice note. This will underpin the Court’s supervisory role at
settlement approval, while
also allowing factors relevant to this discretion to
evolve and adapt with developments in case law.
Recommendation
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) should be
amended to include the principles that govern the exercise of the Court’s
power to approve a proposed settlement,
currently contained in paragraph [13.1]
of the Supreme Court’s practice note on class actions.
Appointing a contradictor for settlement approval
4.177 In recent years, the Supreme Court has changed its view about using
contradictors at settlement approval. While not previously
the case, the
appointment of a contradictor for settlement approval is now the
‘default’ position in Common Law Division
class actions,174 and it
appears to be an increasing trend in other Australian courts.175
4.178 A contradictor, appointed to represent the interests of class members,
is likely to be appointed where the Court has concerns
with some aspects of
settlement, or is not well placed to review a particular aspect of it.
Appointment may be necessary for an isolated
element of settlement approval,
such as the costs of settlement distribution, or it may
be necessary to review the settlement as a whole.176 This will depend on the
facts of the individual case.

176 Submission 30 (Supreme Court of Victoria).
4.179 There was strong support in submissions for the use of a contradictor
during settlement approval, where deemed appropriate by
the Court.177 Although
the assistance provided by a contradictor was recognised to be valuable, most
submissions did not support
appointment being made mandatory due to the
significant costs involved, which reduce the amounts available for class
members.178
Phi Finney McDonald considered these costs
to be so significant that they would be likely to outweigh the benefits of a
contradictor in all but ‘the most flagrant of cases’.179
4.180 Whether a contradictor is necessary may also depend upon the type of
case. For example, Slater and Gordon suggested that class
members in shareholder
class actions are unlikely to need the assistance of a contradictor. It was
submitted they generally have
a good level of understanding of the legal system,
and are either able to resolve their questions about the settlement by
the lawyers, or by lodging an objection with the court.180
4.181 Allens submitted that the practical realities of settlement approval
diminish the utility of
a contradictor, as courts are generally reluctant to significantly intervene
in an agreement reached by the parties unless there are
serious deficiencies and
it is practical to do
so.181 The limited impact of a contradictor on a court’s decision was
also raised during consultations with class members.
Class members who had
experience of a contradictor being used in proceedings suggested that, if
appointed for only a small number
of objecting class members, a contradictor can
cause delays and cost burdens for the entire class, yet will be unlikely to have
real impact on the ultimate approval of settlement.182
4.182 In light of these considerations, the Commission endorses the following
approach to the use of contradictors in Victorian class
• Contradictors should be readily available in class actions involving
complex settlements. While appointment should not be
mandatory, there should be
a presumption that in Common Law Division class actions, or class actions with
complex settlement distribution
schemes, a contradictor will be appointed at
settlement approval. Reflecting this in the Supreme Court Practice Note would
the changed attitude of the Court to using contradictors at settlement
• Increased guidance for the Court, when exercising its discretion to
appoint a contradictor. The Commission agrees with the
Supreme Court that
guidance for the appointment of a contradictor could be usefully set out in the
Supreme Court Practice Note.183
In order to promote flexibility, the guidance
should be non-
exhaustive. Allens suggested that it could include factors such as: the
desirability of the appointment in light of the complexity
of the settlement and
potential impact on class members; the time and costs involved in bringing the
contradictor up to speed; the
level of unrepresented objections received; the
relative proportion of fees to proposed compensation for each class member; any
matter the Court deems appropriate.184
• Greater use of Funds in Court. Funds in Court has significant
expertise in negotiating legal costs, and acting on behalf of
persons with a
disability, due to minority, or an intellectual or physical disability, or both.
The Court has used Funds in Court
in class action settlements where there are
class members with a disability. For example, during the settlement of the
Kilmore East/Kinglake
and Murrindindi/Marysville

Bushfires class actions, staff from Funds in Court collated the necessary

any issues of
concern in relation to claimants with a disability.185 The Commission supports
the continued use of Funds in Court
during settlement approval, and, subject to
resourcing issues, encourages investigation of its use as contradictor more
class actions.
Recommendation
The Supreme Court should consider amending its practice note on
class actions to include guidance for the appointment of an independent
representative (commonly known as a contradictor) to assess the terms of
settlement, or the terms of the settlement distribution
scheme, on behalf of
class members.
Class member objections to settlement approval
4.183 One way for the courts to assess the desirability of settlement for all
class members is to consider both the rate of objection
to settlement and the
opt-out rate. If a number of class members object to, or opt out of, settlement,
it may be an indication that
it is not fair or reasonable for all class
4.184 A lack of objection or a low opt-out rate, however, does not
necessarily represent class members’ assent and may carry
weight.186 Whether it is a relevant indicator will depend, among other factors,
on whether timely and clear notice has been
given to class members, and whether
there is evidence that they actually understand the notice. In reiterating its
protective role
at settlement approval, irrespective of the rate of objections,
the Federal Court in
Money Max Int Pty Ltd v QBE Insurance Group Ltd
It may be the case, as the applicant contends, that the absence of objection
is ‘no small thing’, but care should be taken
before approaching an
application on the basis that class members’ silence is equivalent to
their assent. It is the Court’s
responsibility to protect class
members’ interests and the absence of objections or a low level of
objections does not relieve
it of that task.187
4.185 Allens suggested that reforms which aim to improve the settlement
approval process should focus on alleviating the obstacles
members’ participation in settlement approval.188 The appointment of a
contradictor to coordinate and present class
members’ objections is one
way this can be achieved, and Recommendation 16 seeks to encourage the use of
contradictors in appropriate
class actions.
4.186 As class members bear their own costs in objecting to a settlement,
reducing the costs of objecting is another way of alleviating
obstacles to
participation. While stakeholders indicated it is advantageous to have some cost
obstacles in place to prevent the filing
of ‘unlimited’ objections
to settlement approval,189 the courts are increasingly willing to
allow objecting class members to recoup some of these costs, if the
objections assist the court.190 The Commission supports the continued
of discretion in this manner.

Law, 2017) 13, 38.
4.187 The Commission also observes the importance of clear and concise
notice, and other communication, in increasing class members’
awareness of
settlement, and ability to object, if appropriate. Recommendations to improve
notice and other communication are discussed
at [4.218] – [4.246].
Involvement of parties at settlement approval
4.188 The Supreme Court Practice Note sets out the range of matters that the
parties seeking settlement are usually required to address
at settlement
approval.191 They include how the settlement complies with the criteria for
settlement approval, why the proceedings
have settled on particular terms, and
the effect of the terms on group members. They are set out in full in Chapter 7
of the consultation
4.189 The representative plaintiff is largely responsible for providing the
relevant information to the court (in affidavit form).
In the Federal Court, the
affidavit must also address, where relevant, the terms of any funding agreement
and its application to
the settlement, if approved.192 This requirement
underpins the judicial trend toward greater scrutiny of funding fees in the
Court. This provision could be usefully included in the Supreme Court
Practice Note, and the Commission makes a recommendation to
this effect.
4.190 The defendant, having already agreed to the terms of settlement, is
unlikely to play an active role in settlement approval.
The consultation paper
suggested that greater involvement of the defendant at settlement approval could
provide a cross-check for
the ‘untested and uncontradicted’193
evidence provided by the representative plaintiff’s
lawyers. Submissions did not consider that this would better protect the
interests of class members.194
Accountability during settlement distribution
4.191 Settlement of a class action has two phases. The first phase,
settlement approval, is subject to mandated Court supervision
There is no legislative provision for ongoing judicial supervision of settlement
distribution, which is the second phase.
4.192 The Supreme Court Practice Note states that, at settlement approval,
the Court will generally approve the settlement distribution
scheme and make
orders disposing of the proceeding.195 Accordingly, the accountability of the
scheme administrator to the Court
is largely dependent upon the terms of the settlement distribution scheme. If
it gives the Court a limited supervisory role in the
distribution process or in
resolving any issues, the Court’s ability to rectify problems arising
during the distribution process
will be limited.196
4.193 While the majority of submissions did not consider mandatory Court
supervision of settlement distribution necessary, there was
strong support for
increased accountability through the use of a contradictor, increased reporting
requirements, and increased Court
review of disputed assessments. These matters
are discussed in turn below. The Commission’s recommendations to enhance
accountability
of scheme administrators to the Court are included at the
conclusion of the section.

Extent of Court supervision at settlement distribution
4.194 The necessity of Court supervision of settlement distribution depends
on the circumstances, and type, of proceedings. In large
mass tort class
actions, settlement distribution will require highly individualised loss
assessments to be carried out for each class
member, which will be both lengthy
and costly. It may be appropriate for the Court to maintain close supervision of
the progress
of the distribution to ensure that class members are kept informed
and that issues are resolved expeditiously.
4.195 For example, in the Kilmore East/Kinglake bushfires class action, the
Supreme Court had a heightened supervisory role during
settlement distribution.
Regular case management conferences were held to address the progress of the
assessment process, Court direction
or approval of particular matters,
communication with class members, interim payments of the scheme
administrator’s costs
and other issues.197
4.196 On the other hand, some Commercial Court settlement distribution
schemes can be very straightforward.198 In shareholder or
investor class
actions, settlement distribution tends to be completed within three to six
months.199 The Commission’s consultations
indicated that intensive Court
supervision in these class actions would result in increased costs and delays to
class members, with
few tangible benefits in terms of distribution time.200
4.197 Stakeholders agreed that the degree of Court oversight should remain
discretionary, depending on the circumstances of the case.
Maurice Blackburn
indicated that the appropriate level of supervision will depend on a range of
factors which may include:
• the size of the settlement sum
• the types of losses claimed and the processes for assessing
compensation entitlements
• the timeframe required to assess individual claims
• the complexity of the settlement distribution scheme
• the need (or otherwise) for close Court scrutiny.201
4.198 Given the individualised nature of settlement distribution schemes, and
the demonstrated capabilities of the Court to oversee
settlement distribution
where necessary, the Commission does not consider prescriptive guidelines about
supervision of settlement
distribution are necessary.
Use of contradictor during settlement distribution
4.199 The Supreme Court submitted that the complexity of some settlement
distributions may justify the appointment of a contradictor
to identify issues
only in settlement distribution, as opposed to considering the merits of the
overall settlement more broadly.202
4.200 Justice Forrest has observed, extra-judicially, that any such
appointment will depend
on the size of the asset pool and the issues arising from settlement. Where
there is no differentiation between class members’
claims or where the
cost is disproportionate to the benefit to the class, it will not be necessary.
While Justice Forrest did not
that the appointment of a contradictor would have made any discernible
difference to the approval of the settlement distribution in
the Kilmore
East/Kinglake bushfires class action, he envisaged that some parts of the scheme
that caused problems might have been
identified by a contradictor at settlement
approval, and possibly set up differently.203

4.201 The Commission considers that guidance for the appointment of a
contradictor, whether for settlement approval as a whole or
only for settlement
distribution, should be included in the Supreme Court Practice Note, and makes a
recommendation to this effect
(Recommendation 16).
Court review of disputed assessments
4.202 Where a settlement distribution scheme involves complex individual
assessments, the Supreme Court submitted that it may be desirable
mechanism which enables it to review some disputed assessments. It indicated
that this review should be confined to exceptional
circumstances, and only be
available if the internal review process provided for in a settlement
distribution scheme has already
been followed.204
4.203 Justice Forrest has observed, extra-judicially, that a similar
mechanism may have been useful during the settlement distribution
of the Kilmore
East/Kinglake bushfires. While he noted that the Court did not want to be
involved in individual assessments, he considered
that the settlement
distribution scheme could have provided for the Court to play a
limited role in reviewing certain decisions of the administrator, such
• late registration
• final assessment where the result was legally wrong
• where necessary, in considering an interim distribution of
4.204 The Supreme Court observed that any review mechanism would need to be
included in the settlement scheme put forward at settlement
approval, as
options for further modification of this are limited once a scheme is
approved.206 The Commission makes a recommendation
to this effect
(Recommendation 17).
Regularity of settlement distribution reporting
4.205 As a matter of practice, the Supreme Court requires scheme
administrators to report every six months regarding the progress
settlement distribution and the costs involved.207 There is no formal
recognition of this requirement in the legislation or
Court guidelines.
4.206 In comparison, the Federal Court Practice Note states that the
affidavit in support of settlement should set out the frequency
of any reporting
during settlement distribution, as well as the time at which it is anticipated
class members will receive settlement
4.207 Maurice Blackburn and Slater and Gordon submitted that there may be
value in requiring scheme administrators to provide this
the Court at settlement approval.209 Provision of this information may, of
itself, be relevant to the approval
of the proposed settlement.
4.208 The Commission agrees, and recommends that reporting requirements for
scheme administrators be included in the Supreme Court
Practice Note.

in requiring
scheme administrators to provide information about the time at which class
members receive settlement sums, the difficulty
of giving precise estimates at
an early stage was also noted: Submission 13.
Final reporting
4.209 At the conclusion of the settlement distribution scheme, a scheme
administrator is required to file a final report with the
Court.210 As with
other reporting during settlement distribution, this is not recognised in
legislation or the Supreme Court Practice
4.210 The Commission considers that practice note guidance, setting out the
matters to be addressed in the final report, would be
useful in providing
certainty for the scheme administrators. It would also encourage consistency in
reporting requirements between
different settlement distribution schemes, and
may give scheme administrators an incentive to improve practices where they form
of the reporting criteria.
4.211 Healthcare companies and businesses submitted that relevant factors for
a final report might include: information on the distributions
made to class
members; the time taken for such distributions; and the amounts charged for
distributing. It was also recommended that
compulsory publication of final
reports be considered, to allow a transparent
means of comparing law firms involved in class actions.211 While publication
may be advantageous for data collection purposes, the
Commission considers this
should be subject to confidentiality considerations.
4.212 The Commission recommends recognition of the requirement to file a
final report at the conclusion of settlement distribution
in the Supreme Court
Practice Note. In the interests of confidentiality, the publication of these
reports should be left to the discretion
of the Court.
Accountability for undistributed settlement amounts
4.213 In class actions involving a large undefined class, and where damage to
each class member is very small, it is unlikely that
all class members will
register to share in any recovered amounts. Accordingly, not all the money paid
by a defendant pursuant to
the settlement agreement will be claimed by those who
have suffered damage. Similarly, in a large class action where the settlement
significant, it is likely that there will be amounts remaining after all class
members’ claims have been assessed and distributed.
4.214 In Victoria, it is common practice that if a large amount of money
remains undistributed after settlement distribution, the
Court will generally
redistribute it among registered class members.212
4.215 Redistribution of a small sum, however, will not be economical. In such
cases, the money will generally revert to a charitable
trust or body, as
provided for in the settlement distribution scheme. In the Kilmore
East/Kinglake bushfires class action, for example,
the settlement distribution
scheme contained a provision that any undistributed amounts of money (below a
certain amount) would be
provided to bushfire relief funds.213
4.216 Data collected by Vince Morabito suggests that the Victorian practice
is consistent with the approach of the courts in other
consulted from the Supreme Court indicated that it would be useful for the Court
to have an express discretion
to determine how undistributed settlement money is
allocated, where this is not provided for in a settlement distribution

214 Although only in the early stages of an empirical study, Vince Morabito
has found that in at least 18% of all settled class actions,
the settlement
distribution schemes or orders made after settlement approval envisaged the
payment of undistributed settlement amounts
to persons or entities other than
the defendant, including the class members: Vince Morabito,

4.217 As discussed in Chapter 6, technological advances mean that class
actions where the damage to individual class members is very
small may be filed
more regularly in the future. The Commission considers it prudent for the Court
to have the express discretion
to order how any undistributed money is
allocated, and for the scheme administrator to be required to report on the
distribution
of any unclaimed settlement amounts at the conclusion of the
Recommendations
The Supreme Court should consider amending paragraph [13.5] of
its practice note on class actions to require the affidavit(s) in
settlement approval to include the following additional matters:
(a) the time at which settlement funds will be received by class
(b) a mechanism for Court review of disputed decisions of the scheme
administrator where the settlement involves complex individual
assessments
(c) the application of the terms of any litigation funding agreement to the
settlement, if approved
(d) how class members will be kept informed of the settlement distribution
scheme, including measures to ensure the ease of accessibility
communications for class members
(e) the proposed measures that are being taken, in the settlement
distribution scheme, to ensure a just, efficient, timely and cost-effective
outcome for class members.
The Supreme Court should consider specifying in its practice note
on class actions that scheme administrators report to the Court:
(a) on a six-monthly basis, or other period as determined by the Court,
regarding the performance of the settlement distribution scheme,
including the
costs involved and the distributions made
(b) at the completion of the settlement distribution scheme, outlining the
distributions made to class members, the time taken for
such distributions, the
amounts charged each class member for distribution, and any outstanding amounts
that were unclaimed by class
members, including what was done with these
outstanding amounts.
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) should be
amended to specify that the Court has the discretion to make any orders in
relation to the distribution of money remaining
after settlement
distribution.
Notice and communication with class members
4.218 Ensuring that class members are informed about proceedings and
understand the consequences of participation is an important
way to reduce the
risk that they may be exposed to unfair costs or disproportionate cost burdens
in class actions.216
4.219 The Commission recognises this can be a difficult task. There may be
thousands of potential class members involved in proceedings,
some of whom may
remain unidentifiable. Class members may be geographically dispersed; they may
not speak English as a first language;
they may come from a range of
socio-economic backgrounds, and a class may include both institutional and
individual participants.
Some class members may have signed contracts with
litigation funders and/or lawyers, while others have not. Each type of class
may need to receive different information, communicated in diverse
4.220 Although the Court publishes information about class actions, including
court documents, on its website, class members are most
likely to rely on the
lawyers acting for the representative plaintiff to inform them about the
proceeding. They may be contacted
directly, if the law firm has their details,
or they may seek information on the firm’s website.
4.221 The information that is made available is of two main types: formal
notices approved by the Court; and other information provided
by the lawyers,
ranging from legal documents to general progress reports.
mandates that formal, Court-approved notice must be provided to class
members at certain points during proceedings, including prior
to opt-out and
settlement.217
4.222 The content and style of most other communication with class members
will be determined by the lawyers. Law firms experienced
in running class
actions have developed innovative methods for communicating effectively with
large classes of persons, including
class action websites, social media platforms, and other digital
4.223 Comments were made throughout the Commission’s consultations
nature of the class action, the costs involved, and individual obligations and
rights. The reasons suggested as to why
class members have difficulty in
understanding these things included:
• the lengthy, dense and legalistic information sent by law firms and
litigation funders at the start of and during proceedings219
• the rare use of formal notice at the commencement of proceedings due
to cost considerations220
• the possible distortion or minimisation of risks communicated during
book build, when lawyers and litigation funders have
an incentive to sign
contracts with class members221
• the complexity of formal notice, when used.222
4.224 The Commission was told that a more comprehensive approach to
communication must be adopted in class actions, for both formal
notice and other
communications with class members.223 These are discussed in turn below, with
the Commission’s recommendations
included at the conclusion of the

representative plaintiff may take steps that are contrary to unidentified class

Formal notice
4.225 There was consensus during the Commission’s roundtable
discussions that formal notices, including both opt-out and settlement
are opaque and do not promote understanding by class members.224 Stakeholders
agreed that the clarity and accessibility
of formal notice could be enhanced
through using modern methods of communication for disseminating notice, and by
engaging communications
experts to draft the content.
4.226 The Commission considers that the Court’s website can be more
effectively used than at present to convey information about
class actions, and
notes that it is being upgraded as part of the Court’s Digital Strategy,
with a view to providing a clear
and accessible channel for class members to
obtain information about proceedings. The Commission’s recommendations
Court consider drafting standard form notices (Recommendation 21), and
that the representative plaintiff’s lawyers be required
to produce a class
action summary statement (Recommendation 23), complement this development. The
notices and summary statements
should be published by the Court on its updated
4.227 Stakeholders indicated that there was a lack of independent, accessible
information about class action proceedings more generally.225
The Commission
is of the view that the Court
is best placed to provide an independent source of information for class
members who are deciding whether to participate in a class
action. Such
information could usefully be included on the updated Court website.
4.228 There was strong support expressed for formal notice being drafted by
communications experts rather than lawyers, and that it
should omit jargon,
references to legislative provisions and any details of court proceedings.226
Instead, notice should:
• be drafted by Plain English experts, and should incorporate a greater
use of graphics and pictures.227 The Commission considers
that in Victoria, a
body with significant expertise in the use of plain language, such as the
Victoria Law Foundation, would be
well placed to provide expertise on the
drafting of formal notice.
• be designed and tested by media, communications and design experts to
ensure it is truly effective.228
• be provided in short form where possible, using a dot point summary
of key matters.229
• include the option for a phone call or meeting with the law firm
running proceedings to ensure class members can obtain further
information.230
4.229 The Commission endorses these suggestions being adopted in all formal
particularly in class actions involving vulnerable class members, and
recommends that they also be incorporated in standard form notices
the Supreme Court.231 Standard form notice is discussed below.

Australia’s Class Action Regimes, Fifth Report: The First Twenty-Five
Years of Class Actions in Australia
(July 2017) 21.
Standard form notice
4.230 The form of opt-out notice in Victorian class actions is prescribed by
the Supreme Court Rules,232 and the Court will approve
the form, content and
manner of distribution of the notice in each class action. There is no
prescribed form for settlement notice,
but the Supreme Court Practice Note
contains a comprehensive list of matters that should be included.233
4.231 Some submissions supported the idea that the Court should draft an
opt-out notice
in a standard form and Plain English, and publish this on its website for use
by parties in proceedings.234 This practice has been
adopted in the Federal
Court since 2010, although stakeholders held differing views about its success
in promoting class members’
understanding of opt-out.235
4.232 The Federal Court Practice Note provides additional guidance for
parties drafting opt-out notices. This includes that notice
• use plain language and give a balanced, succinct description of the
claims and defences
• clearly describe the consequences of remaining a class member or
• alert class members to the fact and consequences of costs agreements
or litigation funding agreements
• be disseminated in an effective and cost-effective manner.236
4.233 The utility of standard form notice depends on its ability to capture
the complexities of class action procedure, while remaining
adaptable to a range
of proceedings and comprehensible to class members. As observed by Vince
Morabito, since the introduction of
the Federal Court’s standard opt-out
notice, the complexity of information that must be included in this notice has
significantly
increased.237 If a standard form notice does
not include this information, and communicate it in a clear and
comprehensible manner, it will be of little use to lawyers and will
not improve
class members’ understanding of proceedings.
4.234 The Commission considers that the complexities of opt-out and
settlement, and the need for more clarity in formal notice that
was expressed
during its consultations, necessitates the drafting of Plain English standard
form notices by the Supreme Court. These
standard form notices should
incorporate the suggestions for improving clarity and accessibility included at
[4.228]. These notices
should be published on the Court’s website for use
by parties in proceedings, as part of the Court’s Digital Strategy.

Recommendations
In revising the pages on its website about class actions, the
Supreme Court should consider ensuring that they contain the following:
(a) current and clear information on class actions generally as well as on
proceedings before the Court
(b) links to the Class Action Summary Statement (Recommendation 23) and,
if applicable, the Funding Information Summary Statement
(Recommendation 6) for
each class action
(c) standard form opt-out and settlement notices (Recommendation
The Supreme Court should consider drafting Plain English standard
form opt- out and settlement notices, in consultation with the Victoria
Foundation, and publish these on the Court website.
The Supreme Court should consider amending its practice note on
class actions to:
(a) specify that opt-out notices and settlement notices should, where
possible, follow the standard form notices published on the
Court’s website
(b) incorporate guidelines for preparing opt-out notices consistently with
those contained in the Federal Court practice note on
class actions.
Other communication with class members
Communication during proceedings
4.235 Maurice Blackburn and Slater and Gordon submitted that the methods used
to communicate with class members during proceedings
are both adequate and
appropriate. Use of electronic communication was highlighted as an important
means of increasing
the reach and accessibility of this communication.238
4.236 The Commission’s roundtable discussion with class members,
however, indicated that important information is not necessarily
presented or
explained in an accessible or clear way by the lawyers. The volume of
information was found to be excessive and difficult
to understand, making it
overwhelming.239
4.237 Communication guidelines for lawyers are of limited use, because class
actions vary so much. However, class members in all
class actions do need to
have basic information communicated to them clearly and succinctly. This
includes information about:
• the law firm acting for the representative plaintiff
• the role of the representative plaintiff in proceedings, including
their responsibilities
• the identity of any litigation funder involved, and where to obtain
further information about the funder and the terms of
any finance being
• whether any other class actions have been filed (or are likely to be
filed) on the same subject matter
238 Submissions 13 (Maurice Blackburn Lawyers), 28 (Slater and Gordon
239 Roundtable 5 (clients and consumers).
• how legal fees and disbursements will be charged, including the
impact of any funding equalisation order or common fund order
• who to contact for further information (noting that there is no
charge for this).
4.238 Chapter 2 discusses the use of a standard form disclosure document in
funded class actions. The Commission considers that a
similar disclosure
document should be adopted in all class actions, not just those involving a
litigation funder.
4.239 This document (a class action summary statement) would require the
representative plaintiff’s lawyers to provide standard
information to
class members in every proceeding. In doing so, it would ensure that regardless
of the book building process, or the
experience of the law firm involved, class
members receive the same information in every proceeding.
4.240 In order to be most effective, the Commission considers the class
action summary statement should:
• be drafted in Plain English
• be no more than one to two pages long, and be broken down into bullet
points where possible
• be disseminated to all potential class members at the start of
proceedings, and provided to the Supreme Court for publication
• contain, as a minimum, the information set out at [4.237].
4.241 The Commission recognises that the content of the class action summary
statement may change over time, as class action practice
and funding frameworks
change. The required content should be determined, from time to time, by the
Principal Judges of the Commercial
Court and Common Law Division.
Recommendation
The Supreme Court should consider amending its practice note on
class actions to require the representative plaintiff’s lawyers:
(a) to provide the Court, when the writ for the proceeding is filed, with
a brief Class Action Summary Statement for publication
on its website
(b) at the same time, or before, make the Class Action Summary Statement
available to class members (whether they are actual or potential
through, for example, publication on the representative plaintiff’s
lawyers website.
Communication during settlement distribution
4.242 It is important to ensure that class members are informed of the
mechanics and expected timing of the settlement distribution
scheme. It provides
certainty, avoids unrealistic expectations, and enables class members to elect
alternative payment mechanisms,
such as fast-track payments or interim payments,
if available.240
4.243 Roundtable discussions with class members indicated that information
sent by the scheme administrator about settlement distribution
is often lengthy
and complex. Where information about probable compensation amounts, or the
expected timeframe for distribution was
provided, class members found this
information useful.241
240 Submission 28 (Slater and Gordon Lawyers); Roundtable 5 (clients and
consumers).
241 Roundtable 5 (clients and consumers).
4.244 Although submissions recognised the importance of keeping class
members informed during settlement distribution, they did not
recommend that guidelines be drafted for lawyers on how and what they
communicate with class members during this time.242
4.245 The significant variability of settlement distribution schemes was the
primary reason against guidelines. As submitted by Maurice
communication during settlement distribution will vary significantly, depending
upon the type of class action. For example,
the need and scope for disclosure of
progress, costs and possible outcomes of the settlement distribution scheme in a
shareholder
class action will be very different to
the disclosure that may be warranted in a distribution process that occurs
over several years.243
4.246 While acknowledging the variability in settlement distribution schemes,
the Commission considers it would be useful for the
scheme administrator, at
settlement approval, to be required to inform the Court how class members will
be kept informed during settlement
distribution. The Commission recommends that
this should be included in the Supreme Court Practice Note (Recommendation
242 Submissions 13 (Maurice Blackburn Lawyers), 15 (Phi Finney McDonald), 21
(Law Council of Australia). This view was not held by
all stakeholders: for
example, Submission 11 (Litigation Funding Solutions). Submission 22 (Dr Michael
Duffy) stated that, as not
all class members are clients of the law firm, some
mandating of progress reports would be reasonable.

5. Risks and cost burdens in class actions
Introduction
5.1 Class actions impose inherently disproportionate risks and cost burdens
on the representative plaintiff. If the class action fails,
the representative
plaintiff is solely responsible for the costs of bringing the proceedings and
any adverse costs orders. If the
class action succeeds, the class members will
share the costs of bringing the proceedings.
5.2 Generally, class members are under no obligation to contribute to costs
unless or until a successful outcome is known; and in
Victoria, the Supreme
Court has found that security for costs cannot be ordered against them.1
5.3 The practice of costs shifting is an essential feature of
Australia’s legal system because it discourages legal action that
merit or is speculative. However, the barrier it creates in class actions is
likely to be insurmountable unless the representative
plaintiff can reduce or
remove the substantial costs of bringing the proceedings and the financial risk
5.4 Accordingly, law firms acting on a ‘no win, no fee’ basis,
and litigation funders, have a crucial role in bearing
risks in class actions
and removing or reducing the cost burden. Their involvement, of course, will
increase the costs of winning,
as they are entitled to a commercially realistic
return if the class action is successful.
5.5 While the legal retainer, legal costs agreement and funding agreement
explain the costs that will be charged, not all class members
will necessarily
have seen or signed them. Those who have signed them are unlikely to have
negotiated the terms. It is therefore
important that the court has the power and
capacity, when approving settlement, to ensure that the costs are fair and
reasonable.
The supervisory role of the Supreme Court of Victoria, and
recommendations to strengthen it, are discussed in this chapter.
5.6 The Commission also recommends that the Court’s discretionary power
to reduce the representative plaintiff’s exposure
to adverse costs orders
and security for costs orders in certain circumstances be recognised in
legislation.
5.7 Although not a direct method of reducing risks and cost burdens, it is
important that class members are made aware of the costs
and risks of
proceedings and their ability to object to the costs or opt out of the class
action. In Chapter 4, the Commission recommends
improvements to the information
provided to, and communication with, class members. Recommendations to improve
disclosures about
litigation funding are discussed in
Matthews v SPI Electricity Pty Ltd (No 9)
[2013] VSC 671
(9 December
2013) [162] (Derham AsJ). Costs orders may not be imposed on class members
unless they relate to individual or sub-group
Supreme Court Act 1986
The risks of losing
5.8 The financial risks that the representative plaintiff takes on are
disproportionate not only to the risks borne by other class
members, but also to
the value of their own claim. In
a large class action, the adverse costs risk and the costs of bringing
proceedings will be millions of dollars, while the representative
plaintiff’s claim will be far less. For example, in
Camping Warehouse v
, the average payout per class member was expected to be $633.29,
whereas the legal fees were $2.85 million.2
5.9 As noted in Chapter 4, this disproportionate risk structure can make the
appointment of a suitable representative plaintiff difficult.
The Commission has
been told that, because of the risk, well-resourced class members will rarely
agree to take on the role of representative
plaintiff, even where they form a
significant percentage of the class (such as superannuation companies in
investor class actions)
or where they seek a substantial percentage of the
compensation (such as insurers in mass tort class actions).3
5.10 Like other forms of litigation, the risks of losing that the
representative plaintiff bears in a class action can be reduced
by shifting them
to a third-party. If the class action is one in which a litigation funder is
willing to invest, the representative
plaintiff may be fully relieved of the
risks. While funding agreements vary, the standard practice is for the
litigation funder to indemnify the representative plaintiff for the costs of
bringing the class action and any adverse costs orders.
5.11 If a litigation funder is not involved in the class action, the
representative plaintiff’s exposure to at least some of
the risks may be
mitigated by their lawyers, an insurer or another third party. The options
available would be improved if, as recommended
in Chapter 3, law firms could
apply to the Court to be paid a percentage of any recovered amount on the
condition that, among other
things, they indemnify the plaintiff for adverse
costs and do not charge separately for disbursements.
Liability for legal costs and disbursements
5.12 If the class action is not funded, the representative plaintiff is
likely to enter into a costs agreement with their lawyers
to be charged on a
‘no win, no fee’ basis. Under this arrangement, the representative
plaintiff will not pay the professional
legal costs incurred in bringing the
proceedings if unsuccessful, but will still be liable for any adverse costs
orders and possibly
disbursements.
5.13 If disbursements are not covered by the ‘no win, no fee’
arrangement, the representative plaintiff’s liability
can be mitigated by
private contractual agreement. For example, in the Kilmore East/Kinglake
bushfires class action, some class member
insurers partly funded some
disbursements.4
Liability for adverse costs and security for costs
5.14 If the adverse costs risk is not directly covered by a litigation
funder, ‘after the event’ insurance can be purchased
once a dispute
has arisen or specific proceedings are contemplated. It covers adverse costs
orders and disbursements. It is very
expensive and tends to be taken out by
litigation funders and law firms, which in turn indemnify
the plaintiff for any adverse costs risk. The premium is payable only if the
class action is successful.

Matthews v SPI Electricity Pty Ltd (No 9)
[2013] VSC 671
December 2013).
5.15 A related risk is that the defendant may obtain a security for costs
order. The order is likely to be millions of dollars and
well beyond the
capacity of the representative plaintiff— unless perhaps it is a corporate
entity. If security is ordered,
but not provided, the class action will be
unable to continue. Litigation funders normally cover this risk when they
are involved in a class action. Security for costs in unfunded class actions
is discussed at
[5.103] – [5.115].
5.16 Whether an ‘after the event’ insurance policy will provide
sufficient security for costs in a class action will depend
on the circumstances
of the case and the wording of the policy
in question. For example, in
Petersen Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd v Bank
of Queensland
, Justice Yates considered that, while an appropriately worded
policy might be capable of providing sufficient security, the policy
in question
did not. Security was instead required by payment into court or a bank guarantee
from an Australian bank.5
The costs of winning
5.17 Unlike the costs of losing, which are solely borne by the
representative plaintiff, the costs of winning a class action
are shared among
the class members. The type and amount of costs depend on how the risks of
losing have been covered during proceedings.
5.18 Class members receive less money if the representative plaintiff’s
risks have been covered by a litigation funder, or a
law firm acting on a
‘no win, no fee’ basis during proceedings. This is because the
litigation funder, or the law firm,
will necessarily be rewarded from any
settlement or judgment amounts for taking on this risk.
Litigation funding fee
5.19 Litigation funders charge a funding fee if the case is successful, which
is typically charged as a percentage of any recovered
amount. There may also be
other charges, such as a project management fee.6
5.20 The size of the funding fee, and the responsibility for paying it, is
determined by contractual arrangement. Class members who
sign a funding
agreement agree to pay the funding fee, set at an agreed rate in accordance with
an agreed formula, out of any money
they receive from settlement or
5.21 Common fund orders remove the need for a contractual arrangement between
the litigation funder and class members who pay the
fee. All registered class
members are required to pay, whether or not they have signed a funding
agreement. The size of the funding
fee is determined by the court, most likely
at settlement approval. Common fund orders are discussed at [5.88] –
Legal costs and uplift fee
5.22 A law firm that has reduced the financial risk of losing by acting on a
‘no win, no fee’ basis is paid for its legal
services, plus an
‘uplift fee’, if the class action is successful. The way that legal
costs are charged, including the
uplift fee, is regulated in Victoria under the
Legal Profession Uniform Law,8 and is determined by the legal costs agreement
into between the client and the lawyers.
Petersen Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd v Bank of Queensland Ltd
(21 June 2017).
6 The Commission was told anecdotally that although project management fees
have been charged in the past, they are less likely to
be charged in recent
class actions. As discussed in Ch 2, project management fees and other fees
charged by litigation funders may
not crystallise until certain points in
proceedings, or may depend on certain criteria being met.
7 Submission 18 (Adley Burstyner) suggested that funding fees, as an
unavoidable cost of many class actions, should be recoverable
costs-shifting rule. While this would recognise, in a practical sense, the
ubiquity of litigation funding in many class
actions, it could lead to
distortions in the way that proceedings are filed, or funded. For example, in
the United Kingdom, prior
to 1 April 2013, success fees under conditional fee
arrangements and ‘after the event’ insurance premiums were
recoverable
under the costs-shifting rule. The
review of civil litigation costs undertaken by Lord Justice Jackson in 2009
found that recoverability of these costs imposed disproportionate
cost burdens
on defendants, while plaintiffs’ were able to litigate essentially
‘risk free’. This led to a reversing
of the rule (subject to some
exceptions) effective from 1 April 2013: Herbert Smith Freehills,

Legal Profession Uniform Law Application Act 2014
(Vic) sch 1 (Legal
Profession Uniform Law).
5.23 As set out in Chapter 3, the payment of legal costs in class actions is
different to other litigation. If an ‘all in’
settlement is reached,
legal costs will generally be deducted from any settlement amount prior to
distribution to class members.
Each class member effectively contributes part
of their settlement amount toward legal costs, even if they have not signed a
costs agreement.9 This is appropriate because all class members enjoy the
benefit of the services for which the costs were incurred,
as observed by
Justice Gordon in
Modtech Engineering Pty Ltd v GPT Management Holdings
The legal costs were incurred and achieved a settlement for all group
members. The group members who did not sign a LCA [legal costs
agreement] with
[the representative plaintiff’s lawyers] should not be entitled to receive
a windfall by reason of their refusal
to sign a LCA. To put the matter another
way, the legal costs are fixed. Those legal costs should be borne by those who
from those legal costs being incurred—the group members as a
5.24 The uplift fee is generally set at the maximum legislative rate of 25
per cent of the legal costs.11 There have been examples
of class actions in
which other percentage loadings have been charged by the representative
plaintiff’s lawyers, in addition
to the 25 per cent uplift fee.12

5.25 If the litigation funder or the law firm acting on a ‘no win, no
fee’ basis has taken out
‘after the event’ insurance to cover the risk that the
representative plaintiff will be ordered to pay adverse costs,
the premium will
be deducted from any settlement or judgment amounts. The share is generally
between 20 and 40 per cent of the policy
indemnity limit.13
5.26 Any disbursements not paid during proceedings are paid at the successful
conclusion of the proceedings.14 If covered by a third
party other than a
litigation funder during proceedings, a fee may be charged for this.
Settlement distribution costs
5.27 The costs of winning a class action also include the costs of settlement
distribution,
which are incurred after settlement approval. The scheme administrator
charges a fee for assessing individual claims and distributing
amounts to class
members. These costs are generally deducted from settlement amounts paid to
class members. However, in large
class actions with lengthy settlement
distribution schemes, they may be paid from any interest earned on the
settlement amount during
the distribution period.15
The role of the Court
Assessing costs
5.28 As discussed in Chapter 4, a class action settlement does not have legal
effect unless it is approved by the Court under
section 33V
Court Act 1986
(Vic). The protective role of the Court at settlement
approval extends to approving legal costs and funding fees which reduce the
amounts available for class members.

14 Counsel engaged by the representative plaintiff’s lawyers may agree
to work on a ‘no win, no fee’ basis in a
class action. If so, they
will be reimbursed upon settlement or judgement (but are not entitled to charge
an uplift fee).
15 For example, in the Kilmore East /Kinglake and Murrindindi / Marysville
bushfires class actions, the settlement distribution costs
were deducted from
interest earned on the settlement amount during the distribution period before
reducing settlement amounts payable
to class members: Submission 13 (Maurice
Blackburn Lawyers).
5.29 The basis on which the two types of costs are calculated differ, as does
the approach of the courts in assessing whether they
are fair and reasonable.
Legal costs are based on inputs: work done and time expended in pursuing the
claim. Funding fees are based
on the outcome: a share of the proceeds if
successful. Legal costs are routinely reviewed and varied, while funding fees
subject to less scrutiny. However, recent decisions of the Federal
Court in funded class actions convey an increasingly active role
in supervising
funding fees in that jurisdiction.
5.30 This development has lent weight to the argument that courts should have
a specific statutory power to review and vary all legal
costs, litigation fees
and charges, and settlement distribution costs to be deducted from settlement
amounts in class actions. Views
differ about how prescriptive the legislative
provision should be, but unanimous agreement was expressed during the
Commission’s
consultations that the courts are both competent and well
positioned to continue to oversee limits or approval processes for legal
and funding fees in class actions.16
5.31 The Commission agrees that an express power in legislation would be
desirable, for reasons discussed below.
Assessing legal costs
5.32 In Victoria, where class actions do not typically involve a litigation
funder, legal costs are generally the largest deduction
from the settlement or
judgment amount before the class members receive their share.17
5.33 The Supreme Court’s authority to supervise legal costs in class
actions is widely accepted in case law and well understood.18
Apart from the
Court’s specific role in approving settlements, conveyed by
section 33V
Supreme Court Act
, the authority is founded in the inherent jurisdiction of
the Court and its power under the
Civil Procedure Act 2010
(Vic) to make
any order as to costs that it considers appropriate to facilitate the just,
efficient, timely and cost-effective resolution
of the real issues in dispute.19
This power is
in addition to any other power it has in relation to costs and can be
exercised at any time in a proceeding over any aspect of the
proceeding.20
5.34 In exercising its authority to supervise legal costs, the Court may
• whether the fees and disbursements are of a reasonable amount having
regard to, among other things, the nature of the work
performed, the time taken
the work, the seniority of the persons undertaking that work and the
appropriateness of the charge-out rates for those individuals
• if the work is unreasonable in the circumstances, whether the class
members approved this by entry into the costs agreement.21
5.35 The Court’s authority to intervene and control the legal costs
that class members pay after settlement is not always as
certain. The legal
costs charged by the administrator of the settlement distribution
scheme—which is usually the law firm that
acted for the representative
plaintiff— depend on the terms of the scheme. In its submission, the
Supreme Court observed that
there are particular aspects of settlement
distribution
schemes that need not attract fees based on the work of skilled lawyers, such
as routine settlement administration, which can be carried
out by paralegals.
The Court needs to
16 Roundtable 3 (professional stakeholders). Whether court approval should
remain the only mechanism available for limiting or approving
funding fees, or
whether, as suggested by many stakeholders, national regulation of litigation
funders should be introduced is discussed

Civil Procedure Act 2010
21 This approach to assessing legal fees was adopted in
Engineering Pty Ltd v GPT Management Holdings Ltd
[2013] FCA 626
(21 June 2013) [32]. As reiterated by Justice Gordon, it is the judge, and
not the independent costs expert, that is required to
determine whether the
fees and disbursements are reasonable, and the information provided to the judge
must be sufficient to enable
them to undertake that assessment: [35] –
[37]. This approach was approved by the Supreme Court in

(Osbourne JA).
ensure that it is in a position to oversee the minimisation of settlement
administration costs while also ensuring the process will
be timely and
efficient.22
5.36 Introducing an express statutory power to review all legal costs
incurred during proceedings and settlement distribution (as
well as funding fees
and charges) would strengthen the Court’s ability to intervene when
appropriate. It would also complement
the Commission’s recommendations in
Chapter 4 to strengthen supervision during settlement distribution, and in
Chapter 3 to
allow a law firm to be paid a percentage of the recovered amount in
class actions.
Assessing funding fees
5.37 Compared to legal costs, courts have been less involved in assessing
litigation funding fees as part of settlement approval.
It is uncontroversial
that they have the power
to refuse a settlement if the funding fee is not fair or reasonable, but they
have been reluctant to intervene further and set what
a reasonable fee would be
in the circumstances.
5.38 The reasons for this reluctance are multifaceted. Reviewing a litigation
funding fee requires the court to undertake a commercial
assessment of the risk
borne by the funder—a task it is not comfortable with, or necessarily
appropriately placed to make.
Litigation funding agreements are private and
consensual contracts between two persons. Without strong evidence to the
the courts have traditionally been unwilling to
‘relieve persons of full age and capacity from bargains untainted by
infirmity’.23
5.39 Judicial support is now apparent for the view that the
courts can take a more active role.
Recent decisions of the Federal Court suggest that, as part of settlement
approval, the Court has the power to vary the amount paid
to a litigation funder
to ensure that it is fair and reasonable in the interests of class members.24
Reasons why court supervision
of the funding fee is appropriate were set out in
Money Max Int Pty Ltd v QBE Insurance Group Ltd
• The funding fee is generally the largest single deduction from class
recoveries.
• Information asymmetry exists between the litigation funder and class
members in relation to the costs and risks of the action.
• For some class members, the only chance to obtain legal redress is
through a class action.
• Class members often have a limited or non-existent ability to
negotiate the funding fee.
5.40 The source of the court’s power to set a funding fee at a rate
other than that stipulated in the funding agreement, and
the circumstances in
which it would be appropriate to exercise this power, are unresolved.26 The
issue has not been considered in
decisions of the Supreme Court and is not
addressed in the Supreme Court’s practice note on class actions. There is
some recognition
of the increased supervisory role of the Federal Court in its
Practice Note on class actions, but not in the relevant Commonwealth
legislation.

26 It has been observed that the power of the court to vary a litigation
funding fee is likely to be challenged in the future: Ray
Finkelstein,
‘Class Actions, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly’ in in Damian
Grave and Helen Mould (eds),
25 Years of Class Actions In Australia:
(Ross Parsons Centre of Commercial, Corporate and
Taxation Law, 2017) 415, 432 n 54.
5.41 For this reason, the view was put to the Commission that, if there is
any doubt that the Supreme Court has the power to review
and vary litigation
funding fees as part of settlement approval, it should be expressly provided in
an amendment to
of the Supreme Court Act.27
5.42 Not all stakeholders agreed that such a power is desirable, or should
be codified in legislation. Litigation Capital Management
submitted that, by
reducing the certainty of litigation funders’ contracts, it may increase
the risk of financing class actions.
Litigation Lending Services suggested that
it could lead to a downward shift in funding fees, which may, along with
decreased certainty
for litigation funders, have an impact on access to
justice.28 The Commission considers that these concerns have been adequately
recognised by the Federal Court in recent decisions.29
A statutory power to review and vary costs
5.43 A legislative power to review and vary legal, funding and settlement
distribution costs in
Supreme Court Act
would underpin and
strengthen the Court’s existing practice in reviewing costs as part of
settlement approval in class actions.
is accustomed to assessing legal costs as part of settlement approval, and
the Federal Court is taking a greater role in assessing,
and in certain
circumstances it may modify, litigation funding fees. The Commission endorses
the view that this power is appropriately
exercised as part of the supervisory
function of the courts at settlement approval.
5.44 The protective role of the court at settlement approval is well
established in case law, and extends to the legal costs and
funding fees
proposed to be charged to class members.30
A statutory power for the Court to review and vary costs would be consistent
with this protective role.
5.45 It would also recognise, in a class action context, the Court’s
broad powers under the
Civil Procedure Act
which may be applied when costs are
unreasonable. The overarching obligations contained in the legislation apply to
both lawyers
and litigation funders,
and include the requirement to ensure that costs are reasonable and
proportionate.31
Compliance with the obligations is mandatory. If a breach occurs, the Court
may make any order it considers appropriate in the interests
of justice.32
5.46 Some stakeholders proposed that criteria for the assessment of
funding fees should be set out in legislation or the Supreme
Court Practice
Note.33 The Commission is not persuaded that this is necessary. The power to
review and vary costs should be broadly
expressed, so the Court can respond
flexibly in approving settlement.
5.47 This is not to suggest that guidance for the courts will remain
unnecessary in the future.
As the jurisprudence on assessing litigation funding fees develops, it may be
useful to include guidance in legislation or court guidelines.
It may also
become desirable to clarify certain aspects of the power. Some aspects which may
present difficulties or need further
clarification have been set out
(extra-judicially) by Justice Lee. They include:
• the difficulty in establishing boundaries for court intervention if
funding agreements are altered by the court at settlement

Court when assessing the reasonableness of a funding fee,

importance of avoiding overly prescriptive or exhaustive guidance was noted: 12

• the economic considerations that must be taken into account by a
judge when assessing a commercially realistic return
• the foundational importance of certainty of contract in society.
5.48 The Commission agrees with Justice Lee that the courts will work
carefully through the complexities posed by this power.34 For
this reason, the
Commission considers it preferable for guidance on exercising the power to be
generated through case law rather
than imposed from the outset.
5.49 Finally, while the power should be broadly expressed, the Commission is
aware that in some settlement agreements, legal costs
are negotiated separately
to the settlement amount recovered by class members.35 The Commission’s
recommendation is intended
to enable the Court to supervise costs being deducted
from the full amount paid by the defendant in resolution of proceedings. This
includes supervision of any legal or other costs negotiated separately to the
amount paid to class members.
Recommendation
Supreme Court Act 1986
Vic) should be
amended to provide the Court with specific power to review and vary all legal
costs, litigation funding fees and charges,
and settlement distribution costs to
be deducted from settlement amounts to ensure that they are fair and
reasonable.
Costs experts
5.50 Costs experts assist the court when assessing whether the costs to be
deducted from settlement are fair and reasonable. Their
assistance in class
actions appears to have been sought exclusively in reviewing legal costs.
5.51 In addition, the appointment of a contradictor at settlement approval
can be of particular assistance in reviewing the costs
arising from the terms of
the settlement, or the settlement distribution scheme.36 Contradictors are
discussed in Chapter 4.37
5.52 There has been no demand for costs experts to assist the court in
assessing funding fees in class actions, although this may
change.38 Should
courts begin to use a risk/reward calculus when assessing funding fees and rely
less on the fees charged in previous
cases, the demand for funding costs experts
is likely to grow.39
5.53 The appointment of legal costs experts in large class actions is widely
seen as desirable.40
While mandatory appointment in all class actions is unnecessary, some support
was expressed in submissions for a presumption of appointment
to exist in class
actions if legal costs are substantial.41

Contract: Some Observations’ (Speech delivered at the

Value to the class members
5.54 An important consideration in deciding whether to appoint a costs expert
is the cost to the class members. The role of a legal
costs expert is
time-consuming and complex: large class actions may generate between 10,000 and
65,000 time recording entries. However,
the alternatives to appointing the
expert could be more expensive.
5.55 In the Kilmore East/Kinglake bushfires class action, costs experts
supported the sum of
$60 million being paid to the law firm running the case. Justice Forrest
observed extra- judicially that the Supreme Court’s
acceptance of the
figure provided by the costs experts avoided the bill being sent to taxation,
which in Victoria is another expensive
exercise.42
5.56 The value to the class members of the appointment of a costs expert was
questioned in the submission by Simone Degeling, Michael
Legg and James Metzger.
They argued that, given the current methodology adopted for assessing legal
costs, costs experts are ineffective
in providing any real adjustments to legal
costs in class actions. As long as there is expert evidence that the legal work
was needed,
carried out by a lawyer at the appropriate level of seniority and
using rates in the retainer, the legal costs will be approved
as fair and
reasonable.43
5.57 It is possible that the question of whether appointing a costs expert
represents good value to the class members cannot be determined
only by how much
the lawyers’ bill is reduced, or by any net return to the class members
after the expert’s fee is paid.
Perhaps the prospect that a costs expert will be scrutinising the records
expert’s role is not to represent the interests of the class members;
their interests are for the court to consider.
5.58 The Commission notes that the Federal Court recently observed that,
subject to the question of proportionality, the courts will
not reject expert
evidence, or apply a subjective view of what the legal work is ‘really
worth’ divorced from the commercial
context, without very good reason.45
Clearly, the courts rely on the expertise of costs experts, which underscores
the need for
the assessments they give to be accurate and free of bias.
Independence
5.59 The costs expert is usually appointed by the law firm whose costs are
being assessed, and the pool of experts with appropriate
knowledge and skills in
class action litigation is small. This can raise questions about whether the
experts are free from bias because
they are assessing costs for their clients,
from whom they may want repeat business.
5.60 The independence of the costs expert is essential to their credibility
because, as Simone Degeling, Michael Legg and James Metzger
have observed, their
assessments are largely unchallengeable by class members:
First, no group member has the wherewithal to be able to challenge an
independent costs expert. The court will only receive expert
commissioned by the applicant (really the lawyers) seeking approval of the legal
fees. Second even if fees are greater than
permitted by the Supreme Court scale,
group members may be seen to have
agreed to these fees through entering into a retainer with the lawyer.
However, in a class action, lawyers set their own fees and
group members have
little ability to negotiate.46

reviewing legal costs, unreasonable costs should be avoided
regardless of, or
prior to, review by an independent costs expert: Submission 13 (Maurice

46 Submission 9 (Professor Simone Degeling, Associate Professor Michael Legg,

5.61 Costs experts are usually lawyers who have professional obligations to
the court. In that capacity, and as expert witnesses,
they must also meet the
overarching obligations in
the Civil Procedure Act.47 These obligations apply whether the expert is
appointed by the Court or by the law firm running proceedings.
The Commission
has no reason to conclude that the costs experts who give evidence in class
actions do not meet these obligations,
a view supported by Maurice
Regardless of these legal and ethical obligations to act with honesty and
independence, in our experience we have not observed any
costs expert having
been influenced by
the prospect of repeat work. To the contrary, costs assessors who we have
appointed have on occasion reduced our legal costs where
they considered those
costs to be unreasonably charged or incurred.48
5.62 It is, however, crucial that costs experts are not compromised in their
ability to act, or to be seen to act, impartially.
5.63 As illustrated in
Williams v AustNet Electricity Services Pty Ltd (No
,49 the Court is able to seek assistance from the Costs Court when
assessing legal costs. This may be necessary
if there is no costs expert appointed, or if the evidence provided by the
costs expert is insufficient or requires review. As a demonstrably
independent
option, the Commission agrees with the Court that use of the Costs Court is an
attractive option in ensuring that the
costs claimed by the representative
plaintiff’s lawyers are reasonably incurred, although its use poses some
resourcing issues.50
5.64 The independence of the costs expert is essential to their credibility
and, in turn, a just outcome for the class members. The
Commission considers
that costs experts should be appointed by the Court to underpin, and demonstrate
to class members, the importance
of this independence.
Court guidance on use of experts
5.65 The Federal Court Practice Note includes guidance for the use of costs
experts in class actions in reviewing both legal costs
and litigation funding
fees. In relation to legal costs, the expert will assess whether the total legal
costs are fair and reasonable
(by examining a sample of files or records); in
relation to the litigation funding fee, the costs expert will assess whether the
charges are appropriate, having regard to the terms of the funding
agreement.51
5.66 More extensive sampling of legal costs, or examination of the litigation
funding fee,
is suggested where the class members include persons who are not clients of
the law firm; where the deduction per class member constitutes
a significant
proportion of
the settlement amount otherwise payable to each class member; or where the
funder imposes charges beyond the percentage fee set out
in the funding
agreement (for example, a project management fee).52
5.67 The Commission considers that similar guidance should be given in the
Supreme Court
Practice Note. However, unlike the Federal Court Practice Note, the Supreme
Practice Note should not specify what methodology the legal costs expert
should use. The Commission was told that methodologies used
by costs experts
develop and change over time. In order to provide the most accurate assessment
and thereby deliver value to class
members, and to ensure best practice, it is
important that experts have the flexibility to adopt the most appropriate
methodology
in assessing legal costs.

5.68 The Commission is of the view that the costs expert should be appointed
by the Court, rather than the representative plaintiff’s
lawyers.53 This
is not specified in the Federal Court Practice Note.
Recommendation
The Supreme Court should consider amending its practice note on
class actions to provide guidance for the appointment of an independent
expert by the Court to assist in the assessment of legal costs and litigation
funding fees. This should take into account the
guidelines contained in the
Federal Court practice note on class actions relating to the use of costs
Costs budgets in class actions
5.69 Introducing costs budgets in class actions—where parties submit a
legal costs estimate to the court at the first case management
conference—was suggested as being a useful way of increasing certainty of
legal costs in class actions, holding lawyers accountable
to a predetermined budget, encouraging settlement, and ensuring control of
legal costs from an early stage.54 The use of costs budgets
may be of some
assistance to the court in assessing the reasonableness of legal costs claimed
at settlement approval.
5.70 Costs budgets are used by courts in England and Wales. In some
proceedings, parties are required to submit costs budgets to the
court and the
other party before the first case management conference. If legal costs
subsequently exceed the predicted budgets,
parties are required to seek court approval for the increase. The courts have
indicated that they will limit parties’ recoverable
costs to the estimated
amounts, where appropriate.55
5.71 Although Victoria does not require cost budgets to be submitted in class
actions, the Supreme Court has the power, under the
Civil Procedure Act
order lawyers to produce an estimate of costs and disbursements at any point of
proceedings. This can also be for the benefit
of the defendant or any party.56
This power does not appear to be regularly used in a class action context.
Although the Commission
does not consider there is any need to supplement the
provisions of the
Civil Procedure Act
, guidance about use of this power in class
actions may be usefully provided in the Supreme Court Practice Note.
5.72 It will not be necessary or appropriate for the Supreme Court to request
an estimate of legal costs in all class actions. For
example, in shareholder
class actions, the likelihood that the case will be settled is exceptionally
high (no shareholder class actions
have proceeded to judgment). Providing a
costs budget in these cases may be difficult, and of limited value, given the
uncertainty
involved in settlement.57

Control of funding fees in class actions
5.73 The terms of reference direct the Commission to examine two specific
processes for controlling the fees chargeable by litigation
1) that limits be placed on litigation funders’ fees
2) that approval processes be put in place in respect of litigation funding
5.74 Imposing a cap is one way of limiting the fees charged. The cap could be
determined either by legislation, the court or a combination
5.75 Approval processes that are already in place can affect the amount
which litigation funders receive from class members. The
court has the capacity
to determine funders’ fees when a common fund to pay them has been
ordered. Common fund orders require
the applicant to seek court approval of a
funding fee prior to it being deducted from the recovered amount. As all class
pay the fee, rather than only those who have
entered a funding agreement, common fund orders also ensure that the costs of
bringing litigation are evenly shared between all class
5.76 The Federal Court has demonstrated its willingness to use these methods
in relation to litigation funding fees; whether they
require express legislative
provision in Victoria is discussed below.
5.77 Stakeholders generally endorsed the use of caps and sliding scales for
litigation funding fees in class actions as a means of
ensuring proportionality.
There was also consensus that the court should determine how much the funder
receives in each case.58 However,
views differed about whether the fees should
be subject to statutory limits.
5.78 Allens and Ashurst, for example, favoured the introduction of statutory
caps and sliding scales. They suggested that caps could
apply to both the
percentage amount and the total dollar amount recoverable by the litigation
funder. In applying these controls,
consideration would be given to the net
percentage of recovered amounts that class members would receive.59 Sliding
scales could
also be used to reflect the point reached by the proceedings and
the expenses incurred by the litigation funder. The Court would
discretion to determine the appropriate fee in light of the circumstances of
the case at settlement. This would ensure that funding fees below the cap are
not automatically approved.60
5.79 While agreeing that caps and sliding scales for funding fees may be
appropriate in certain cases, other stakeholders identified
the following
reasons why it would be unhelpful to specify them in legislation.
58 Roundtable 3 (professional stakeholders).
59 Submissions 12 (Allens), 27 (Ashurst). Submission 4 (Chartered Accountants
Australia and New Zealand) noted a number of members
supported a cap on the
proportion of fees that a litigation funder could take. Submission 16 (National
Union of Workers) submitted
that the court should have some form of discretion
through a formula that it can work to, once an order is made.
60 Submission 12 (Allens).
5.80 First, a cap may simply turn into the minimum standard rates.61 Lawyers
routinely charge the 25 per cent maximum uplift fee when
acting under a
‘no win, no fee’ arrangement in a class action. It is reasonable to
anticipate that a legislative cap
for litigation funding fees is likely also to
become the standard rate.
5.81 Secondly, it was proposed that a mandated cap or sliding scale may
reduce access to justice. Funders who invest in high-risk
or novel claims
require a commensurately higher level of return. Litigation Lending Services
and Slater and Gordon observed that,
if a percentage amount is not high enough
to justify the funding of higher risk or novel claims, there may be limited
incentive for
a litigation funder to take the case on, thereby reducing access
to justice.62
5.82 Thirdly, in class actions, the diverse risk profile of proceedings may
require a nuanced approach to fees. IMF Bentham submitted
considerations of the circumstances of the case, and an assessment of the
market, is not conducive to fixed or inflexible
methods or structures.63 The
importance of this flexibility has been recognised by the Federal Court, which
observed that, compared
with regulation under idiosyncratic state legislation,
the Court is well suited to the task of bringing flexibility and nuance to
assessment of the reasonableness of fees in class actions.64
5.83 Finally, if the trend toward increased judicial scrutiny of litigation
funding fees at settlement approval continues, the need
for legislative caps and
sliding scales—whether desirable or not—is reduced in class actions.
As part of this increased
scrutiny, the Federal Court has demonstrated that it
is prepared to use the necessary mechanism, whether a cap or sliding scale,
ensure that the funding fee is fair, reasonable and proportionate.65
5.84 For these reasons, and in the interests of ensuring national consistency
and avoiding
‘forum shopping’, the Commission considers it appropriate that
the Supreme Court continue to develop its expertise in
applying caps and sliding
scales to funding fees. There is no need for legislative guidance.
5.85 The Commission’s recommendation to recognise, in legislation, the
Supreme Court’s ability to review and vary all
litigation funding fees and
charges complements the exercise of this discretion without imposing inflexible
parameters.
Common fund orders
5.86 Australian courts have developed a range of mechanisms and practices to
ensure that the costs of bringing a class action are
fairly distributed among
class members at settlement:
• Closed class actions, which can limit participation in a class action
to those who have signed a funding agreement, ensure
that only class members who
agree to contribute to the costs share in any settlement or judgment
• Class closure orders, which require class members to register by a
particular date, allow all class members sharing in settlement
to be identified
and so help to ensure that costs are allocated fairly.
• Funding equalisation orders, which deduct an amount equivalent to the
funding fee from the settlement payments of class members
who have not signed a
funding agreement and distribute it back (pro rata) to all class members, ensure
equality of treatment between
class members. Class members who have not signed
a funding agreement do not receive a windfall at the expense of those who

(Murphy, Gleeson and Beach JJ).
5.87 Most recently, the Federal Court has approved the use of a common fund
for litigation funding costs in class actions. If the
court makes a common fund
order, all registered
class members are required to contribute part of their settlement amount to
the litigation funder, even if they have not signed a
funding agreement. This
represents a fundamental reform to how the costs of class action litigation are
set and approved, and how
they are shared among class members.
Common fund orders for litigation funding fees
5.88 Unless a funded class action is closed for the duration of the
proceedings, it will comprise both members who have signed the
funding agreement
(funded class members) and those who have not (unfunded class members). If the
class action is successful, only
the funded class members are required to pay the funding fee, at the rate set
in the funding agreement. To avoid this burden being
placed only on funded class
members, a representative plaintiff can apply for a common fund order, which
requires all class members
to contribute to paying the funding fee, at a
court-approved rate.
5.89 A significant advantage of common fund orders is that they spread the
cost of litigation funding across a greater number of class
members than would
be the case under contractual arrangement, and reduce the need for the
litigation funder to book build.
As a result, an applicant for a common fund order should seek a lower funding
fee than would be the case if payment depended on execution
of a funding
agreement. Class members who have already signed a funding agreement may be
better off.66
5.90 Similarly, a common fund order should not result in class members who
have not signed a funding agreement paying a higher rate
than those who have.
This would effectively penalise class members for failing to sign a funding
agreement, and would allow the litigation
funder to receive an increased return
without a corresponding increase in risk.67
5.91 Critically, if a common fund order is made, the court has the power to
set the size of
the funding fee, which may be at a lower rate than would otherwise be
payable. Unlike a funding equalisation order, in which the amount
unfunded class members will likely be equivalent to the contractually agreed
funding fee,68 a common fund order clearly
provides for court approval of the
funding fee. This is likely to occur later in proceedings, such as at settlement
approval or distribution
of damages.69
Common fund orders for legal costs
5.92 In Australia, common fund orders have been formally applied only to
proceedings involving litigation funders, where the funder’s
contractually determined and the funding fee is charged as a percentage of the
settlement or judgment amount.
5.93 In Chapter 3, the Commission recommends that lawyers be able to apply
for common fund orders for litigation costs, which include
legal costs and
disbursements and coverage of the risk that the court will order the
representative plaintiff to pay adverse costs
or provide security for costs.
66 One of the ‘safeguards’ referred to by the Federal Court in
approving a common fund order
in Money Max Int Pty Ltd v QBE Insurance Group
[2016] FCAFC 148
(2016) 245 FCR 191
was the floor condition that no class member could
be worse off under the orders than she or he would be if such orders were not
made: 196, 213–15 ( (Murphy, Gleeson and Beach JJ). This safeguard was
applied in the context of a funding
equalisation order otherwise being made. While subsequent case law has
discussed the importance of not decontextualising the order,
the counterfactual
of a funding equalisation order need not necessarily always be used:
Blairgowrie Trading Ltd v Allco Finance Group Ltd (rec and mgr apptd) (in
liq) (No 3)
[2017] FCA 330
(2017) 343 ALR 476
, 504–5 (Beach J).
67 For example, in a class action currently before the Federal Court, the
application for a common fund order proposed that upon resolution,
class members
who had not signed a funding agreement would pay a 30% funding fee. Class
members who had executed a funding agreement
would pay a 20% funding fee. Both
amounts were stated to be subject to determination by the Court:
Capic v Ford
Motor Company of Australia
, Federal Court Proceedings NSD 724 of 2016.
68 See, eg,
Money Max Int Pty Ltd v QBE Insurance Group Ltd
[2016] FCAFC 148
245 FCR 191
, 196. If, however, the contractually agreed funding fee
is excessive, the deduction of an equivalent amount under a funding
equalisation order will not be fair and reasonable. Recent case
law indicates
that in such circumstances, the court has the power to reduce the funding fee as
part of settlement approval: see,
Earglow Pty Ltd v Newcrest Mining Ltd
[2016] FCA 1433
(28 November 2016) [7] , [137] (Murphy J).
69 A further ‘safeguard’ referred to by the Federal Court in
approving a common fund order in
Money Max Int Pty Ltd v QBE Insurance Group
[2016] FCAFC 148
(2016) 245 FCR 191
was that the amount of the funding fee should be
deferred until the end of the proceeding, when more probative and complete
information
would be available. However, the Court also considered accepting the
funding fee rate proposed by the applicant with a view to reviewing
settlement approval. It was observed it may not always be necessary or
appropriate to decline to set the funding fee until
settlement approval, but
rather, it would depend upon the circumstances: 195, 221 (Murphy, Gleeson and
Use of common fund orders
5.94 As discussed at the Commission’s roundtables and recognised in
submissions, common fund jurisprudence in Australia remains
in its infancy.70
Approval of common fund orders was given by the Full Federal Court in October
2016,71 and the source of the power
to make common fund orders has not yet been
appealed to the High Court.
5.95 While applications for common fund orders are now standard practice in
Federal Court class actions,72 there is limited case law
regarding their use.
The Supreme Court has
not made common fund orders for litigation funding costs in Victorian class
However, the Commercial Court has made orders, and approved settlements,
requiring all class members to contribute to funding costs,
including those who
have not signed a funding agreement.74
5.96 Most stakeholders expressed strong support for the continued use of
common fund orders for approving and sharing the cost
of litigation funding.
Reasons cited for this support included:
• Common fund orders encourage the use of open class actions, which are
consistent with the opt-out basis of Australia’s
class action regimes and
promote finality for defendants.75 Views differ as to whether they will reduce
the number of competing
class actions filed.76
• Common fund orders have the effect of spreading the cost of the
litigation among a broader group, but with the protective
oversight of the
court. The court is able
to ensure that common fund orders are implemented in a way that is fair and
reasonable, given that a larger group of claimants are
contributing to the
funder’s recovery.77
• Common fund orders provide for increased judicial involvement in the
determination of a ‘reasonable’ funding fee,
and enable courts to
set the funding fee at a different rate to that stipulated in the funding
agreement, if appropriate. This is
in keeping with the supervisory role of the
Court under
Supreme Court Act
and may result in lower costs for
class members over time.78
• Common fund orders avoid the disadvantages associated with a
prescriptive regulatory approach to litigation funding fees,
and allow courts to
react to diverse funding situations.79
5.97 Not all submissions were in favour of common fund orders. They represent
only one means of ensuring that the costs of litigation
funding are shared
equally between the class; other methods, such as funding equalisation orders,
may achieve the same result but
produce a better outcome for class members in
the circumstances of the case. Allens noted that common fund orders represent a
from freedom of contract, in that they create a binding arrangement
between persons who have not expressly agreed
to be bound.80 Common fund orders may also result in an adjustment of a
funding fee already agreed to under contract. Some litigation
funders noted the
increased commercial

uncertainty introduced by common fund orders: if a funding fee is subject to
court approval at settlement, there is less certainty
regarding the rate of
Express legislative power to make common fund orders
5.98 The court’s power to make common fund orders arises from its broad
discretion to make orders as appropriate or necessary.
The basis of the Federal
Court’s power has been identified in case law as arising variously from
sections 23
of the Federal Court Act.82
is a general
power to make orders as the Court thinks appropriate;
section 33V(2)
the Court to make orders as are just with respect
to the distribution of money paid under a settlement or paid into court; and
section 33ZF
is a power to make any order that is appropriate or necessary to
ensure that justice is done in the proceeding.
5.99 The Supreme Court’s power to make common fund orders has not been
judicially considered, but the
Supreme Court Act
contains equivalent provisions.
In the absence
of an express power to make a common fund order, the Court’s ability to
do so may be challenged at a future point in time.
5.100 The Commission is of the view that common fund orders are of
significant advantage in ensuring that funding fees are subject
oversight, and that the costs of winning litigation are evenly distributed among
class members. In allowing proceedings
to be run on an open basis, and removing
the need to book build, they offer the advantage of increasing access to justice
methods of sharing costs between class members, such as funding
equalisation orders.83 As set out in Chapter 3, they also provide
a framework
for allowing lawyers to obtain a percentage share of the recovered amounts in
class actions, with appropriate court control.
As part of a broader framework of
ensuring disproportionate cost burdens for litigants in class actions, their use
should be encouraged.
5.101 Judges consulted from both the Federal Court and the Supreme Court
indicated that
an express legislative power to make common fund orders, although unlikely to
change practice, may be useful.84 The Commission agrees.
5.102 A secure legislative basis for common fund orders should not be
inflexible or prescriptive.85
The legislation should allow for the nuanced and multifaceted nature of
common fund orders. As submitted by Maurice Blackburn, a ‘one
all’ solution for common fund orders would inevitably fail to account for
the diverse situations in which class actions
may require third-party financing,
and could risk restricting access to funding.86
Recommendation
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) should be
amended to specify
that the Court has the power to approve a common fund order, on application
by a representative plaintiff, whereby all costs of proceedings
are shared by
all class members if the litigation is successful.

Other means of reducing risk
The Court’s discretion in making security for costs and adverse
costs orders
Security for costs in unfunded class actions
5.103 Security for costs orders provide an important protective mechanism for
defendants in proceedings. If a defendant seeks an order
for security, the
plaintiff is essentially required to show that they will be able to meet any
adverse costs order made against them.
is generally achieved by paying an amount of money into court, although it
may also be satisfied by a bank guarantee or, in some cases,
evidence of a
comprehensive insurance policy.
5.104 The significant costs involved in class action litigation mean that
defendants may be strongly motivated to seek some security
at an early stage of
proceedings.87 In recognition of this, the Australian Law Reform Commission
(ALRC) recommended in its 1988
on grouped proceedings that an order for security should not be made on the
basis that the proceedings are brought for the benefit
of someone other than the
plaintiff.88
5.105 Although the courts have a largely ‘unfettered’ discretion
to order security for costs
in proceedings,89 early decisions from the Federal Court indicated a
reticence to order security against a representative plaintiff
in unfunded class
actions for fear it would force class members to contribute to these costs and
remove the immunity from costs orders
that they enjoy under
Federal Court Act. It was also considered that the costs of security could
potentially prevent a proceeding from continuing,
thereby reducing the public
interest purpose of the regime.90
5.106 Since 2003, however, the Federal Court has been willing to order
security for costs in unfunded class actions, requiring contribution
class members.91 In doing so, the Court has differentiated contribution to
security from other costs orders. Depending
on the circumstances, the Federal
Court has indicated that ordering security may not be incongruous with class
members’ immunity
from costs orders:
It is one thing for a group member to be saddled with an order for what might
be joint and several liability for a very substantial
costs order at the end of
the hearing of a representative proceeding, but it is another thing to have the
choice of contributing
what might be a modest amount to a pool by which the applicant might provide
security for costs.92
5.107 The impact of such orders on class members’ participation in the
proceedings can be significant. For example, in
Kelly v Willmott Forests
class members who did not make a contribution to security—because they did
not show an inability or reasonable
unwillingness to contribute, they refused to contribute, or did not respond
to the request to contribute—were excluded from
sharing in the recovered
amount (despite being bound by the result of proceedings).93

5.108 It has been observed that the process of requiring class members to
contribute to security for costs, and excluding those who
do not pay and do not
provide a reasonable reason
for failing to do so, ‘cannot be seen as a positive in terms of access
to justice’.94 The reasons for this include:
• Individuals without resources are potentially excluded from accessing
• If class members cannot raise sufficient security for costs, the case
may be brought to an end. The claims of interested class
members and those with
resources are therefore stopped by the other class members’ lack of
interest or resources.
• Investigating which class members should contribute to any security
for costs is a cumbersome, expensive and time-consuming
• Proceedings are made significantly more expensive initially, thereby
discouraging class action litigation.97
• The representative plaintiff may be forced to accept a poor
settlement.
• It provides an incentive for class members to remain unknown in
proceedings (and not contribute to security for costs), thereby
exacerbating the
‘free rider’ problem in class actions.98
• It goes against the intention of the ALRC in its 1988 report on
grouped proceedings, which stated that security for costs
should not be ordered
simply on the basis that persons other than the representative plaintiff stand
to benefit from the proceeding.
• It may encourage class actions to be restructured to avoid the need
to pay security for costs, thereby increasing costs and
delays in class action
proceedings.
5.109 The Supreme Court’s discretion to order security for costs in
Victorian class actions appears to be different from that
of the Federal Court.
Although there is limited authority supporting the power to order security for
costs in class actions, the
Court has found
section 33ZD
Supreme Court Act
, which allows costs to be ordered
against a representative plaintiff, enables security for costs to be ordered in
appropriate cases.99
5.110 However, the Court does not have the power to directly order class
members to provide security. While the Federal Court Act
provides that, except
as otherwise provided by part IVA, nothing in part IVA affects the operation of
any law relating to security
for costs,100 there is no equivalent provision in
Victoria, New South Wales or Queensland.

5.112 A different approach was taken by the New South Wales Supreme Court in
De Jong v Carnival PLC
.102 Although Justice Beech-Jones found that the
Court is prohibited from ordering security against class members, he indicated
security could be
ordered against the representative plaintiff which might require contribution
from class members.103 As noted by Legg and McInnes,
this has the same effect
as ordering security against class members.104
5.113 The Commission acknowledges the legitimate policy objective of
protecting the interests of defendants in class actions through
security for
costs orders, and that factors to consider when ordering security are continuing
to develop through case law.105 It
considers, however, that security should be
ordered only by reference to the resources
of the entities and individuals who are contributing to the costs of
proceedings, such
as a litigation funder, a group of well-resourced class members, or a
corporation. In the interests of access to justice, it is not
desirable that
security be ordered by reference to the resources of class members. They have
no obligation to pay adverse costs
orders and no control over the
litigation.
5.114 The Commission’s recommendation that security for costs should
not be ordered against class members is made in conjunction
recommendations throughout the report, which include:
• Recommendation 8, which would enable lawyers to be paid a contingency
fee in class actions, if, among other conditions, they
agree to pay any security
for costs order. Allowing lawyers to charge on this basis will reduce the number
of proceedings in which
the representative plaintiff is exposed to a security
for costs order.
• Recommendation 14, which would enable the Court of its own motion to
replace a representative plaintiff. If proceedings are
brought in which
well-resourced class members are standing behind a ‘person of
straw’, this power would enable the Court
to replace the representative
plaintiff with the class member(s) who could meet an order for security. This
would allow the action
to continue—thereby promoting access to
justice—while also preventing the undesirable situation in which all class
are exposed to security for costs orders due to the impecuniosity of the
representative plaintiff.
• Recommendation 29, which recognises the Court’s discretion to
order security for costs in class actions, including those
that involve a novel
area of law or are in the public interest.
5.115 Finally, the Commission acknowledges that there may be proceedings in
which class members agree, or volunteer to contribute
to the costs of bringing
proceedings, including security for costs. The Commission’s recommendation
does not interfere with
the ability
of class members to do this; rather it prevents the Court ordering
contribution from class members who have not agreed to do so, and
required to contribute to other costs, with the result that they do not share in
any recovered amount.
Recommendation
Section 33ZD
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) should be
amended to specify that the Court may not order a class member to provide
security for costs.

Adverse costs in unfunded class actions
5.116 As discussed in Chapter 2, while litigation funders are frequently
involved in class actions in the Federal Court, they are
far less prevalent in
those brought in the Supreme Court. Most representative plaintiffs in Victorian
class actions will not be indemnified
for the risk that, if the litigation is
unsuccessful, they will be liable to pay adverse costs.
5.117 The Commission’s recommendation in Chapter 3 that lawyers be able
to apply to be paid a percentage of any recovered amount
if, among other things,
they indemnify the representative plaintiff for adverse costs, will mitigate
5.118 The Commission considers it desirable that further measures be taken to
reduce the adverse costs risk for the representative
plaintiff in class actions
that concern a matter of public interest or a novel area of law. Class actions
of this type may not be
seeking a monetary award, or may be seeking an amount
that is too low to attract the financial support of a litigation funder or
5.119 When determining whether to make an adverse costs order, and the
conditions of the order, the Court has wide discretion. An
initiative that could
be useful in Victoria would be to introduce a statutory provision that expressly
recognises public interest
criteria that the Court can take into account.
Although it would not remove the risk, it would reduce it, with the possible
• the role of representative plaintiff becomes less daunting, which
encourages suitable volunteers to take on the challenge
• third parties consider providing financial support when they
otherwise would not have been prepared to bear the risk.
5.120 Such a provision exists in Ontario, where the
Class Proceedings
, SO 1992 sets out the court’s discretion in awarding costs in
class actions.106 When exercising its discretion, the court may
consider whether
the class action is a test case, raises a novel point of law or involves a
matter of public interest. This provision
applies in conjunction with the
general civil procedure cost rules, which the court will take into account when
determining costs.
5.121 This legislative discretion has resulted in a very cautious approach to
awarding adverse costs in public interest class actions.
Where awarded, adverse
costs orders have been significantly reduced. The Commission was told that this
cautious approach to awarding
adverse costs has allowed Ontario’s public
fund for class actions, the Class Proceedings Fund, to operate successfully in
class actions in the public interest.107
5.122 The Commission’s proposed statutory provision, which would also
apply to orders for security, is discussed in the next
Statutory discretion in making these costs orders
5.123 To overcome the disincentive caused by costs shifting so that,
potentially, a greater number of low-value class actions will
be pursued, the
costs rules could be amended to specify that the Supreme Court has a discretion
when awarding adverse costs and security
for costs orders in class actions to
take into account factors relating to access to justice and the public interest.
These factors
would apply in conjunction with those relating to the
court’s discretion to award costs developed through case law.108
Class Proceedings Act
, SO 1992, c 6, s 31(1).
107 Consultation 5 (Associate Professor Jasminka Kalajdzic). There is some
evidence that this may be changing: in two recent class
actions, significant
adverse costs orders have been made against the representative plaintiff. As a
result, defendants have twice
been awarded adverse costs in class actions (for
$1 million, and $2.3 million). These adverse costs orders have not been paid by
the representative plaintiff: in one case, they were paid by the lawyers, in the
other, the Class Proceedings Fund: Consultation
5 (Associate Professor Jasminka
Kalajdzic).
108 For example, the factors that have developed through case law relating to
the courts discretion when ordering security for costs:
Carnival PLC
[2016] NSWSC 347
(1 April 2016) [26] (Beech-Jones J);

, 19–20 (Allsop CJ and Middleton
Kelly v Willmott Forests Ltd (in liq)
[2012] FCA 1446
(2012) 300 ALR 675
(Murphy J).
5.124 The provision could be drawn from the statutory discretion in the
Ontario Class Proceedings Act. The Commission considers that
it should specify
that it applies to both adverse costs as well as security for costs. This view
is consistent with the findings
of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission. In
its 2012 review of security for costs and associated costs orders, the New South
Wales Law Reform Commission recommended that, in considering an application for
security for costs in a class action, the court should
take into account, among
other factors, the immunity from costs orders provided under the legislation and
the function of class actions
in providing access to justice.109
Recommendation
Supreme Court Act 1986
(Vic) should be
amended to specify that in making an adverse costs order, or a security for
costs order in class actions, the Court
may take into account, among other
(a) the function of class actions in providing access to justice
(b) whether the case is a ‘test’ case or involves a novel area
(c) whether the class action involves a matter of public interest.
Public fund for class actions
5.125 The extent to which the market can be relied on to facilitate access to
justice is necessarily limited by the commercial nature
of the financial
products and services offered. The Commission sought comments from stakeholders
on ways to improve access to justice
through funding arrangements, other than
by lifting the ban on lawyers being able to charge contingency fees.
5.126 Several responses referred to the idea of establishing a public fund,
akin to the Ontario Class Proceedings Fund and previous
proposals for assistance
of this type.110 The notion that public funds should be available to support
class actions has been a topic
of discussion and debate for many years. In its
1988 report, the ALRC argued that, without public funding, the purpose of the
action regime in providing access to justice would be undermined by the
operation of the costs-shifting rule and the burden this
places on the
representative plaintiff. Public funding was seen as an appropriate
acknowledgment
of the public purpose of many class actions, the burden of which should not
rest with the representative plaintiff.111
5.127 The ALRC recommended a public fund to address the disproportionate
cost burdens faced by the representative plaintiff. The
fund was envisaged as
self-financing to some extent, although it was also expected to receive any
money that remained unclaimed by
eligible class members in proceedings.112
5.128 Since then, the need for a public fund for this purpose has been
reiterated in commentary from members of the legal profession,
the judiciary,
and academics. The Commission
was among the proponents. In its 2008 review of the Victorian civil justice
system, it recommended a self-funding Justice Fund to
provide financial
assistance to parties with meritorious claims in the public interest, in
conjunction with law firms charging on
a ‘no win, no fee’

5.129 A public fund that provides financial assistance to plaintiffs in
meeting the costs of litigation already exists in Victoria.
Law Aid, which has
been operating since 1996, is a charitable trust established under
Legal Aid Act 1978
(Vic) to cover
disbursements for meritorious civil claims, where lawyers are acting on a
‘no win, no fee’ or pro bono basis and the plaintiff
otherwise unable to afford litigation. It is managed by the Law Institute of
Victoria and the Victorian Bar Council. The
Commission suggests that there could
be scope for it to fund, in part, class actions.
5.130 Law Aid commenced with $1.68 million in seed funding, which has been
more than sufficient for its continued existence. In return
for covering the
cost of disbursements, Law Aid has a statutory entitlement to a fee of 10 per
cent in successful cases. However,
it has not been necessary for this amount to
be charged. It commonly charges 5.5 per cent.114
5.131 Law Aid does not appear to be widely used. When it was created, it was
expected to handle about 380 applications a year but
the most it has received
was in 2010, when it received 314 applications for funding.115 The Commission
was told that there have
been no requests to use Law Aid to fund disbursements
in class actions.
5.132 In comparison, the Ontario Class Proceedings Fund provides financial
support to approved class actions, to cover adverse costs
awards as well as
disbursements. Cases are selected on the basis of the merits of the claim and
the public interest involved.116
In practice, the Class Proceedings Fund has
rarely been required to cover adverse costs because the court has exercised its
discretion not to order them.
5.133 The fund was established in 1992, under the Law Foundation of Ontario,
with seed funding of $500,000 (about a third of the seeding
amount that Law Aid
received) and has since been self-funded. As at June 2017, it had a balance
sheet of around
$19 million.117 After 20 years in operation, the fund had supported over 82
class actions (from a total of 131 applications) representing
10 per cent of all
class actions in Ontario. Of the funded matters, 30 per cent went to trial
(rather than settling) to serve as
test cases, establish novel legal principles
in class action case law and address issues of broad public importance.118
5.134 The Class Proceedings Fund charges a fee, which is capped at 10 per
cent of the settlement amount, for its services in successful
litigation. The
Fund has had a 2:1 success rate.119

Court resources
140 Introduction
140 Resource implications of the Commission’s
recommendations
144 Technological innovation and the conduct and management of class
6. Court resources
Introduction
6.1 The Commission recommends reforms aimed at improving procedural
efficiency, strengthening accountability and controlling costs
in class action
proceedings. In this chapter, the implications of these recommendations for the
workload and resource requirements
of the Supreme Court are considered, as
required by the terms of reference.
6.2 Most of the recommendations in this report concern the Court’s role
and powers, primarily in class actions. Some will have
an impact on the level of
legal and administrative support needed in managing proceedings of this type;
others will directly affect
the judge’s role. While additional resources
will be needed to implement the
recommendations, the Commission expects there will also be savings from
improvements to procedural efficiency.
6.3 The Supreme Court has expressed a commitment to innovation and excellence
and is upgrading the technology it uses and streamlining
its processes. Changes
in technology are improving the efficiency of court proceedings, and are
beginning to affect access
to the legal system generally and the types of class action that are being
instigated. These developments are perhaps most visible
in the United States. If
they become more prevalent in Australia, they could stimulate new debate about
the place of class actions
in our legal system. This chapter concludes with an
overview of these trends.
Resource implications of the Commission’s recommendations
Current allocation of resources
6.4 Class actions represent a small fraction of the Supreme Court’s
workload, with an average of five being filed each year.
More than 6000 cases
were initiated across the Court
in the financial year ending 30 June 2017.1 However, compared to other cases,
class actions are significantly more resource-intensive,
and often require
extensive judicial case management.
6.5 At the heart of the Court’s approach to facilitating the just,
efficient, timely and cost- effective resolution of the real
issues in dispute
is differential case management. The resources required vary considerably, both
between cases and over the course
of a proceeding. Accordingly, the Court
allocates staff as necessary rather than retaining a permanent support team.
6.6 In addition to their other duties, two legally trained members of staff
have been allocated ongoing roles as Class Actions and
Major Torts Coordinator
and Commercial Court Class Actions Coordinator. They assist in the management of
class actions in the Common
Law Division and the Commercial Court respectively.
Their roles are to serve as contact points
1 Supreme Court of Victoria,
Annual Report 2016–17
for the public and the profession, which saves time for practitioners and
facilitates registry processes, and to provide support directly
to members of
the Court, which allows for the best use to be made of judicial time in managing
proceedings.
6.7 When a number of class actions are before the Court at the same time,
resources are stretched and the level of support suffers.
Staff are often
removed from other areas of the Court to deliver judgments quickly and ensure
the continuing progress of the class
action case. While this has been a highly
effective measure, it reduces the availability of research and associate support
areas of the Court from which the staff are drawn.2
6.8 In its submission, the Supreme Court identified a need for additional
legally qualified staff to support the judiciary and provide
better services to
the profession. This would reduce the cost of class action litigation overall,
and improve access to justice.
The Commission considers that, in implementing
the recommendations of this report, the Court will
require additional staff to work on class actions.
6.9 The Supreme Court’s submission also identified the benefit of
referring discrete issues arising in class actions to specialised
offices of the Court, where necessary.3 For example, the expertise of the Costs
Court and Funds in Court have been called
on to assist judges in some class
actions. The Commission encourages continued referral of certain issues to
specialised areas of
the Court, subject to the availability of resources.
Recommendations that affect the Court
6.10 The recommendations in this report that affect the Court fall into three
categories:
• procedural changes, to improve efficiency, accountability and
national consistency
• better information for, and communication with, the public
• legislative changes to clarify and strengthen the Court’s
6.11 The resource implications for each differ and are discussed below.
6.12 All of the changes will benefit from consultation with stakeholders
has established a
class action user group drawn from the legal profession; it convenes every 12 to
18 months, and the Court has found
the group to be quite constructive.4 The
user group could be a useful forum
for consulting about amendments to the practice note on class actions
(Supreme Court Practice Note), or the production of materials
for class members,
or any other changes that affect the way in which class actions are conducted
and managed.
6.13 The Commission considers that consultation with the user group about the
recommendations would be even more helpful if the membership
were expanded to
include class members. Clearly, class members can provide advice on
recommendations concerning the information provided
to the public, and how it is
communicated. In addition, as the costs of proceedings are generally paid from
the settlement or judgment
amount before class members receive their share,
class members have an interest in procedural changes that will improve
and transparency.
Recommendation
The Supreme Court should consider expanding the class action
user group to include individuals with experience in class actions,
either as a
class member or a representative plaintiff, particularly to consult on the
implementation of the Commission’s recommendations
on Court powers,
procedures and services.
2 Submission 30 (Supreme Court of Victoria).
4 Consultation 4 (Judges of the Supreme Court of Victoria).
Procedural changes
6.14 The Commission recommends that the Supreme Court consider amending the
Supreme Court Practice Note.5 Some of the changes will
clarify the Court’s
expectations and procedures, providing guidance without reducing the
Court’s flexibility.6
6.15 Other changes will introduce new procedural requirements. New disclosure
obligations will ensure that the Court, and class members,
are routinely
informed about funding arrangements or other matters that may affect the way in
which the proceedings are conducted
or resolved.7 The recommendation that the
Supreme Court Practice Note should specify additional matters that affidavits in
of settlement approval should address will also improve transparency, as
well as efficiency.8
6.16 While the task of introducing the amendments will require the time and
expertise of legally qualified staff, the ongoing resource
implications for the
Court are not expected to be onerous and may produce savings.
Information for, and communication with, the public
6.17 The Court is likely to require additional resources to implement the
Commission’s recommendations about information that
is made available to
class members and the community.
6.18 Preparation by the Court of standard form opt-out and settlement
notices, as recommended, is a discrete task that will require
expertise and the resources to engage an appropriately qualified contractor or
consultant.9 It should not have ongoing
resource implications.
6.19 In addition, the Commission’s recommendations that the lawyers for
the representative plaintiff provide a Class Action
Summary Statement and, if a
litigation funder is involved, a Funding Information Summary Statement,10 will
require the Court to
identify what details these statements should contain. Then
there will be an ongoing administrative burden in ensuring that the statements
are provided.
6.20 The Commission proposes that the standard form notices and summary
statements be published on the Court’s website.11 This
will create an
ongoing administrative responsibility, to ensure that the information is
published. However, this could be incorporated
into the existing duties of staff
who maintain the information about class actions on the website.12
6.21 Similarly, with regard to the resource implications of upgrading and
managing the Court’s website, no additional information
resources should be necessary. The Commission notes that its recommendation
falls within the ambit of technological
changes that are currently underway in the Court, which includes a new
website that will be delivered in 2018.13
Court powers
6.22 A number of recommendations concern the Court’s role. Some clarify
powers and may increase efficiency by avoiding the delays and disputes that
can arise where there is uncertainty.14 Efficiencies may
also be achieved by the
introduction of recommended new own motion powers to order that a proceeding no
longer continue

as a class action, and to replace the representative plaintiff with another
class member.15
The other recommendations that affect the Court’s role are for
incremental changes that do not depart substantially from the
powers currently
available to courts under other Australian class action regimes. They include
recommendations that:
• lawyers be able to apply for a common fund for the payment of costs
that they incur for and on behalf of their clients
• the Court have the discretion to make orders about the distribution
of money remaining after settlement distribution
• the Court have discretion in making an adverse costs order or
security for costs order.16
6.23 The overall effect of the recommendations reinforces the Court’s
protective role at settlement approval, which is a role
that can be onerous, and
may become more so. For example, the greater prevalence of common fund orders
will increase the Court’s
role in reviewing risk-based costs. This trend
predated this review and would have continued in its absence.
6.24 It is difficult to predict the impact of these recommended changes on
the Court’s resources because the features of class
actions differ and not
all of the changes will be relevant in every case. As so few class actions are
filed in the Court, the Commission
considers that the workload implications for
judges will be manageable, with appropriate research and associate support.
6.25 As noted above, the Court has identified a current need for more legally
qualified staff
to support the judiciary and provide better services to the legal profession.
The Court has also submitted that, with additional resources,
• develop more accessible explanations of the class action process
• develop templates for opt-out notices
• enhance digital communication.17
6.26 The Commission’s recommendations will increase the need for staff
to assist members of the Court, initially in developing
and introducing the
changes, and into the future as the Court’s protective role strengthens
and it raises its profile as a
source of information about class actions
generally. The Class Action Coordinators for the Common Law Division and the
Court have responsibilities that are affected by many of the
recommendations and may need assistance for their part in responding
6.27 The Commission recommends that additional legally qualified staff be
assigned to support members of the Court in managing class
actions. They could
provide research assistance and case management assistance as required and
would otherwise work in conjunction
with the Class Action Coordinators in
implementing the recommendations and
monitoring the progress of cases, responding to enquiries from the public,
and liaising with the parties.
6.28 In making this recommendation, the Commission is acknowledging that
resource requirement that needs to be met. It notes that the allocation of
Court resources is a matter for the Court, which in turn
receives funding
through Court Services Victoria. The Commission is also aware that any
additional allocation of resources to class
as a result of the Commission’s recommendations may be offset by
efficiencies that are expected to be achieved through the digital
transformation
of court processes.

Recommendation
The Supreme Court should consider providing additional legally

responsibilities arising from them for
Technological innovation and the conduct and management of class
6.29 New technologies are rapidly changing the delivery of traditional legal
services. The Law
Society of New South Wales has described the pace and extent of change as a
wave of innovation’.18 Automation, artificial intelligence, the rise of
social media, big data, cloud computing, encrypted digital
currency, blockchains
and smart contracts are some
of the many recent innovations changing the way lawyers work and the delivery
of legal services.19 These innovations are being applied
in the delivery of
legal services to improve access and efficiency and reduce costs.
6.30 Both practitioners and clients are driving the uptake of new technology.
Law firms are recognising that it can help in identifying
potential clients, and
lead to greater efficiencies and productivity. Consumers are demanding greater
access to the legal system
and the quick resolution of claims. Traditional legal
models are increasingly viewed as too slow and too costly.
6.31 Across the legal market, lawyers, together with regulators, professional
bodies and universities, are moving to meet the demands
and challenges that come
with such rapid transformation. This change is now affecting the way most court
services are delivered.
In the next section, the digital transformation of the
Supreme Court is discussed.
6.32 The application of new technologies to legal processes is changing how
class actions are managed and the types of claim that
it is cost-effective for
legal firms to bring. High-volume/low-value claims that previously would have
been too costly to run are
being brought within reach. Access to justice by the use of the class action
procedure is improved and, in principle, this trend should
be welcomed.
6.33 Developments in the United States, while not directly applicable to
Victoria, suggest the direction in which class actions may
evolve. There,
reluctance on the part of regulators to pursue low-value compensation for
victims of corporate misconduct combined
with the ability of law firms to use
new technology to quickly aggregate claims on behalf of those victims have led
to a growth of
high-volume/low-value class actions that was not envisaged 25
6.34 A concerning trend is that the value of the claims to the class members
can become so small that the benefit in providing access
to justice is, by any
measure, slight. The public interest is served only to the extent that the class
action provides a means of
regulating corporate activity. This was not the
purpose of introducing class actions in Australia and, if the trend strengthens
it will raise questions about the most effective use of court resources
and the role of the regulator in claims against corporate
misconduct. The
is discussed at the end of this chapter.

Technology upgrades at the Supreme Court of Victoria
6.35 The Supreme Court is undergoing a significant technological
transformation that aims to put it at the forefront of technological
in the delivery of court services. The Supreme Court’s vision for digital
transformation, under an ambitious Digital
Strategy, is to design and deliver
services that are more effective, less costly and more responsive for court
The Digital Strategy is built on the well-founded assumption that targeted
investment in a number of key electronic services will
improve access to
justice. The Strategy is drawn from an internal needs assessment and external
best practice, which together present
a coherent, measured approach.20
6.36 The Court aims to adapt business processes to meet both the changing
expectations of the legal industry and the community and
to be ready for future
developments.21
To promote the effective use of new technologies in the conduct of civil
litigation, and specifically to reduce time and costs, the
Court has issued a
practice note that makes it clear that it expects parties to apply technology to
meeting their obligations to
ensure their costs are reasonable and proportionate
Civil Procedure Act 2010
The practice note acknowledges that different uses of technology are
appropriate across the spectrum of court proceedings and will
develop over
time.23 However, if technology is available to improve efficiencies and lower
costs, parties will be expected to use
6.37 The digital transformation of processes in the Commercial Court has
begun, and this will improve the efficiency of class action
procedures. Indeed,
one of the factors driving change in the Commercial Court has been the increase
in complex ‘mega litigation’
including class actions and the
associated resource demands. Judicial Registrar Julian Hetyey recently remarked
that the reforms
to enhance service delivery and manage commercial matters more
effectively and efficiently had become critical:
The Supreme Court of Victoria has an extensive history of accommodating the
particular needs of the business community in the management
and hearing of
commercial cases. This is because the Court has long recognised that certainty,
predictability and timeliness are
the lifeblood of commerce. And increasingly,
commercial litigants and their lawyers have come to demand expedition and
commerciality
in decision-making.24
6.38 The introduction of e-filing and a new electronic case management system
will greatly improve efficiencies in class action processes.
Electronic case
management will allow faster and more streamlined access to case information for
parties. It will also allow the
Court to capture more data about matters as they
progress through the Court.
6.39 Rebuilding the Court’s network infrastructure and upgrading
in-court technology will enable the Court to live-stream cases,
video conference
and web-cast hearings in all of its
34 courtrooms. The benefits of the Court’s commitment to incorporating
the use of new technologies in the context of class actions
is already being
experienced. The Court has introduced courtroom technology to enhance the
in-court experience of the parties and
The Kinglake-East Kilmore Black Saturday class action was conducted as an
electronic trial for the full 208 days of trial. The parties
used electronic
court books which ultimately saw 23,105 documents (including videos and sound
files) in digital form loaded and 10,400
tendered. Any documents not in the
e-court book could only be added in digital form. NuLegal managed the process in
the courtroom.
The documents, when referred to by counsel, were displayed on
numerous screens in a purpose-built

Innovation in the delivery of legal services
6.42 Innovation in the delivery of legal services is helping to improve
access to justice.
Globally, companies and law firms are using new communications, information
and data management and analysis technologies and specialised
software to
provide legal services differently to traditional legal practices.28 Sometimes
referred to as ‘disrupters’

services in the past.29
6.43 Social media and mainstream media are also changing the ways that
lawyers promote their services and interact with clients. Law
developing online systems that can access millions of clients and need not
confine their operations to a geographical location.
Global access to legal
disputes and clients is creating unprecedented opportunities, as well as global
competition.
6.44 The following examples of legal services provided through online
platforms and specialised software are not only lean and efficient,
also providing greater transparency and price certainty, with fixed prices for
particular services that clients can afford.30
Marketplace/Online lawyers.
A range of online platforms,
including websites, enable lawyers to market their services to potential
clients, and applications connect
clients to their lawyers. More complex
platforms allow consumers to post a legal issue directly online and, through the
use of algorithms,
their request is matched with a lawyer who then handles the
specific legal work entirely on the online platform.31
Document automation.
Companies are providing clients with
fixed priced online access to documents that can be customised online. There is
also an increasing
use of smart contracts that can fully automate
transactions.32
Practice management.
These platforms provide online back
office support for law firms. Platforms can provide detailed case management,
online communications
channels, as well as time and billing management
software.33 There is also software specifically designed for the management of
class actions and settlement distribution.

contracts are increasingly used in the finance and property sector and they
remove the need to draft and exchange
paper contracts. In contrast to other
online legal documents, the contracts are self-executing, with computer code
that records the
terms of the agreement on blockchain technology. The smart
contract will fully automate the transaction, so that once one contract
condition is satisfied, it will automatically trigger performance of another

Legal research and analytics.
Legal research is increasingly
undertaken by artificial intelligence software. Specific legal research software
is able to undertake
complex legal research in seconds in response to almost any
legal question. Software that provides ‘big data’ analytics
increasingly being used in assessing legal risk management. Such software can
research decades of case law and immediately
uncover trends and patterns to help
consider how a particular case will fare in a particular jurisdiction.34
Online dispute resolution.
Platforms manage a range of
disputes including divorce and parenting disputes and there are online tribunals
dedicated to residential
tenancy disputes.35
E-discovery.
Digital tools for law firms are enhancing the
process of discovery in litigation. De-duplication technology removes duplicated
from discovery, reducing the number of discoverable documents and
saving costs. Similar technology groups e-mail threads and automatically
documents that might be privileged from production and is now considered a
regular part of litigation.36 The Court expects
parties with discoverable
documents exceeding 500 pages to implement a cost-effective discovery plan
incorporating the use of technology.37
6.45 Adapting to automation is quickly becoming a business imperative for
legal practice. Law firms that are early adopters of new
technology are able to
offer profoundly different services to those that rely on traditional processes.
Technological innovation
both opportunities and challenges for the courts, as observed by Justice
Michelle Gordon, of the High Court, in a presentation on
disruptive technology
and rule of law.38 Justice Gordon highlighted in particular the increasing
prevalence of online dispute resolution
platforms and the emergence of automated
decision-making technology, which can improve access to justice and efficiency
also reduce the transparency of judicial and administrative
Technology has the potential to bring enormous benefits to our legal system.
But we need to embrace those benefits with the knowledge
and understanding of
the effects, risks and challenges that accompany technological change. Failing
to consider and, where appropriate,
to address the effects, the risks or the
challenges is not an option. Pretending that they do not exist is also not an
option. Indeed,
the sooner we ask, and answer, these fundamental questions, the
better it will be for the development of new tools and ideas that
technology, as well as for the rule of law.39
6.46 Characteristics of class actions lend themselves to technological
innovation. The Commission notes that the ongoing initiatives
of the Supreme
Court of Victoria to improve efficiency across all of its activities provides
the opportunity to deliver more effective,
efficient and affordable access to
justice through the class action procedure in a considered and planned way.

Innovation in class actions
6.47 Class action regimes in the United States are increasingly supported and
managed by independent companies that provide online
registration and
administration of class actions, using software developed for this purpose.
Class members can submit
documentation online and ask questions of an online evaluator considering
their claim. They can interact with a resolution platform
and the software can
then facilitate the administration and distribution of the settlement.40
6.48 Technology is being used in similar ways in Australia. Maurice
Blackburn noted in its submission that it is increasingly making
use of digital
technology in the management of class action awards, implementing cost-effective
and efficient settlement administration
processes. All of its class action
registration processes are online, which removes the
risk of misplacing hardcopy materials and increases speed and accuracy in
claims management.41 Innovative software of this type may
also be able to
provide objective and targeted assistance to the court, balancing fairness and
cost in the settlement distribution
6.49 However, the combination of class action procedures and technological
innovation also enables lawyers to be more ‘entrepreneurial’,
they act less as an agent in the claim and more as the initiating party.42
Submissions have highlighted the growing risk of
the class action system being
used for ‘lawyer-driven’ litigation that needs to be appropriately
6.50 Many products and services are mass-produced and mass-marketed; when
they cause harm, they do so on a large scale.44 Simply being
a consumer can also
a member of a class action somewhere in the world. However, the potentially
large settlements in mass scale class actions may not
translate into benefits
for the victims of the misconduct, while the actions themselves place a
significant burden on the justice
6.51 With the ability to aggregate mass claims, there has been a significant
increase in consumer class action claims in the United
States that are
high-volume and low-value. They are referred to as ‘negative value’
claims and are discussed below.
Negative value claims
6.52 Consumer class actions involving the food and beverages industry in the
United States have increased from 20 claims in 2008 to
more than 170 new claims
filed, or moved to, federal courts in 2016. Commonly referred to as
‘shopping aisle class actions’,
they have been brought on behalf of
consumers who have been misled by labelling, packaging and advertising. While
the potential damages
available for individuals in such claims can be
as little as a few dollars, once aggregated, these class actions have reached
multimillion dollar settlements.46

an example, in January 2013, an Australian teenager posted a photo on Facebook
of a ‘foot-long’ Subway sandwich
he had purchased in the US. The
sandwich was photographed next to a ruler which showed that the sandwich
actually measured an inch
short of a foot. The post went viral on the internet
and within weeks lawsuits had been filed across the US by people claiming their
sandwiches were also less than the advertised size. The parties reached a
settlement in 2016, however the US Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit
recently overturned the decision. See
In re Subway Footlong Sandwich
Marketing and Sales Practices Litigation
, 869 F 3d 551 (7th Cir, 2017).
6.53 Research into the outcomes of class actions in the United States found
that, although some types of class action provide for
the automatic distribution
of benefits to class members, this has almost never occurred in consumer class
actions. Some consumer
class actions were settled without even the potential for
a monetary payment to class members.47
6.54 Although the litigation culture in Australia is more conservative than
in the United States, there have been recent examples
of low-value consumer
class actions. A class action recently brought against the manufacturer of a
pain medication produced a settlement
scheme providing for consumers to be
compensated between $3.16 and $5.70 per product purchased.48 The loss suffered
by one of the
representative plaintiffs was valued between $185.90 and
6.55 As noted by the Consumer Action Law Centre, class actions can be
important to ensure that the full scope of wrongdoing is assessed
and remedied
by a court, but they might not always be the most efficient mechanism to deliver
compensation. 50
6.56 Allens raised concern that, where class actions are pursued for reasons
other than seeking an adequate remedy for class members,
there is an increased
risk of the system being
used for ‘speculative or reverse engineered claims’ rather than
proper consideration being given to the best and most
efficient way to advance
class members interests.51
6.57 Submissions also highlighted that class actions are not the only
mechanism to facilitate access to justice for a group of affected
Other mechanisms in relation to consumer claims include public action by
regulators and systemic conduct investigations
by industry-based ombudsman schemes that may have the ability to deliver more
efficient remedies to consumers than the class action
Class actions as a form of regulation
6.58 Class actions have been considered a useful deterrent to corporate
misconduct in Australia.53 However, this is not how the Australian
Commission (ALRC) envisaged class actions would be used. The use of class
actions as a form of regulation was specifically
rejected in the ALRC’s
1988 report on grouped proceedings. The ALRC clearly specified that the primary
goal of the scheme would
be to deliver legal remedies to those who have suffered
loss or damage.54
6.59 Currently, regulators’ enforcement actions are guided by the
broader public interest of deterring corporate misconduct,
while compensation
and restitution is left to private litigation. This means that, even where a
regulator has taken action in court
on a particular matter, individual consumers
or businesses are left to seek compensation for particular harm through private
or through class actions.55

6.60 However, as ways of providing a remedy to a victim of corporate
misconduct, private litigation and class actions continue to
be expensive
options. The 2017 review of Australian Consumer Law identified court action as a
significant barrier to consumers in
seeking compensation for loss or damage.
Court proceedings are often too costly and difficult for consumers, especially
where foreign
goods or parties are involved.56
6.61 The private sector will take on the compensatory role of the regulator
only in situations that provide commercial outcomes. For
example, noting that
individual shareholders are unlikely to be able to take legal action in response
to corporate misconduct and
that litigation funders invest in only a minority of
possible claims, the Australian Shareholders’ Association submitted that
access to justice is constrained under the class action regime.57
6.62 Class actions can be extremely complex litigation. They can be long and
expensive. If the remedy being sought for each class
member is of little value,
particularly after the costs of litigation are met, it is appropriate to
question whether bringing a
class action is the most effective method to achieve
a fair outcome for those who have suffered loss or damage, and the most
use of court resources. With the development of automated and online
case management and settlement distribution software, regulators
could consider
alternative mechanisms to facilitate more effective redress than relying on
private litigation and the class action
6.63 In a recent example, the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission
used its power under
section 87B
Competition and Consumer Act 2010
to negotiate enforceable undertakings from a group of telecommunication
companies that contravened Australian Consumer Law.
The regulator was able to
negotiate to
deliver compensation to the 58,700 affected consumers without the need to
commence court proceedings.59 However, as the Consumer
Action Law Centre
pointed out in its submission, many sector-specific regulators do not have
powers to obtain compensation for affected
consumers, and those that do rarely
exercise them.60
6.64 The Commission notes that this may be a matter that the ALRC might wish
to consider in its current review of the Commonwealth’s
class action

7. Conclusion
7.1 Victoria’s class action regime has improved access to justice.
Thousands of Victorians have benefited from the procedures
introduced in 2000 by
Supreme Court Act
(Vic). Combined, they have received more than one billion dollars
in compensation that they would have been unable or unwilling to
separate claims. Eighty-five class actions have been filed on behalf of a wide
variety of claimants, from vulnerable individuals
to institutional investors and
insurers. Two in every three class actions settled.
7.2 Crucially, the regime affirms the Supreme Court’s role in ensuring
that the procedures are fair and that the outcome takes
into account the
interests of all class members.
7.3 The recommendations contained in this report aim to further improve
access to justice.
They build upon changes in how class actions are now being
managed—particularly by the Supreme Court of Victoria but also by
Federal Court of Australia and the Supreme Courts of New South Wales and
Queensland—in response to the activities of litigation
funders and
entrepreneurial law firms. This report, and the reference, are directed at
Victorian processes. The recommendations relate
to the Victorian Supreme Court
while advancing a nationally consistent approach.
7.4 A number of significant features of class actions today were not
envisaged when the regime was first established and have been
developed by the
courts in exercising broad discretionary powers. For legal certainty and
procedural clarity, the Supreme Court of
Victoria should be given express
powers, or consider providing comprehensive guidance, in support of its
responsibility to: ensure
that the claim is appropriately brought as a class
action; review costs; approve settlement, and supervise the distribution of
proceeds. For reasons discussed in Chapter 4, a pre-commencement
certification process is not necessary or desirable.
7.5 The Commission’s consultations with judges, law firms and
litigation funders revealed a marked consensus that class action
practices and
procedures should be consistent across Australian jurisdictions. Although there
is a high degree of commonality, the
Victorian Supreme Court’s practice
note on class actions is not as prescriptive as the practice
note issued by the Federal Court of Australia. It does not refer to
litigation funders and provides less guidance to law firms about
obligations to class members.
7.6 The differences reflect the limited involvement of litigation funders in
class actions in Victoria, and the greater caseload of
mass tort proceedings,
which often present unique characteristics that are best managed when the Court
can respond flexibility. However,
to avoid ‘forum shopping’ and other tactics that exploit actual
or perceived differences at the expense of efficiency,
the Supreme Court
Practice Note should align more closely with its Federal Court equivalent.
7.7 While the Court has a role in ensuring that class members are not exposed
to unfair risks or disproportionate cost burdens, there
is an inherent disparity
in the class action regime because the representative plaintiff carries the
financial risk of losing as
well as being liable for the costs of bringing the
proceeding. In most class actions it creates
an insurmountable barrier or risk unless some or all of the costs are
contingent on a successful outcome.
7.8 Litigation funders have enabled class actions and other litigation to be
pursued by meeting upfront costs and removing or reducing
the financial risk of
losing. They have become integral to the legal system and increasingly pervasive
and should be regulated nationally.
The court, the parties, and any persons on
whose behalf funded litigation is conducted should made be aware that a
litigation funder
is involved and the nature of its involvement. In addition,
the Court should have an express power to review and vary litigation
charges or costs in class actions.
7.9 Within Victoria, the impact of litigation funders in enabling litigation
other than class actions to proceed is unknown although,
as discussed in
Chapter 2, the involvement of a litigation funder in a claim made on behalf of
former employees of Huon Corporation
Limited attracted controversy.
7.10 Litigation funders clearly have had little impact in enabling class
actions to be brought in the Supreme Court of Victoria.
By far the most
prevalent form of financial assistance to representative plaintiffs in Victoria
has been the provision of legal services
by law firms on a ‘no win, no
fee’ basis. However, charging on a ‘no win, no fee’ basis
usually does not
relieve the representative plaintiff of liability for
disbursements or reduce their exposure to the risks of being ordered to provide
security for costs or pay adverse costs.
7.11 There are cogent reasons for permitting lawyers to charge contingency
fees in appropriate areas of law. Previous reviews, including
Commission’s 2008 Civil Justice Review, have recommended it. There is also
persistent concern that lifting the ban would
increase the risk or incidence of
unethical conduct because of conflicts of interest. However, existing rules and
ethical guidelines
for the legal profession are comprehensive and more robust
than those that apply to litigation funders, and the Commission recommends
further guidance on the recognition, avoidance and management of conflicts of
interest in class actions.
7.12 The Commission has concluded that, in principle, lawyers should be able
to charge contingency fees because it would provide another
funding option for
litigants who are unable to bring proceedings without financial assistance. It
would increase competition.
It may reduce costs in some cases and enable the pursuit of claims that are
not financially viable investment opportunities for litigation
funders. The
challenge of how to improve access to justice by permitting lawyers to charge
contingency fees, with appropriate regulation,
should continue to be pursued
nationally.
7.13 In the meantime, more class actions may be pursued, at lower cost, and
at less financial risk to the representative plaintiff,
if lawyers could apply
to the Court to charge a percentage of any settlement or judgment amount.
Concerns that have been raised in
the general debate about contingency fees can
be controlled and managed within the limits
of the class action regime, where the Court has a strong supervisory role in
ensuring that costs are fair and reasonable.
7.14 While not disturbing the general ban on contingency fees, or changing
the common procedural form of class actions in Australia,
a percentage of the
recovered amount could be sought by lawyers acting for the representative
plaintiff in class actions in the Supreme
Court of Victoria. As discussed in
Chapter 3, an application would need to be made for a common fund order, subject
to conditions
that address concerns about costs and conflicts of interest.
7.15 The conditions would include that the lawyers provide security for costs
if ordered, indemnify the representative plaintiff for
adverse costs and cover
the cost of disbursements, as well as provide legal services. This would
overcome the disadvantage of charging
on a ‘no win, no fee’ basis,
and be comparable to the services provided by
litigation funders. The fee would be decided by the Court when approving
settlement, or if awarding compensation or damages at the
conclusion of a
7.16 The importance of ensuring that the costs of bringing the proceedings,
and the financial risk of losing, do not unreasonably
prevent meritorious class
actions from being pursued was identified in 1988 by the Australian Law Reform
Commission when developing
the procedural model on which Australia’s class
action regimes are based.1 Litigation funders have since provided a means of
overcoming the cost barrier, although the extent they do so is necessarily the
result of commercial decisions.
7.17 With the knowledge gained over the years during which the class action
regime has operated, combined with the perspectives of
the current era, it is
now possible to address the need for a more comprehensive solution to provide
better access to justice. The
Commission proposes in this report a pathway
towards that solution—one that should improve access to justice; provide
appropriate
regulation of litigation funders; maintain proper ethical conduct by
lawyers; and not involve unfair or disproportionate burdens
upon litigants.
