applicant was afforded the opportunity until 21 August 2009 to file any further
submissions in the registry after he had received
the submissions of the Chief
Executive. He did not do so and when contacted by registry on 24 August 2009 the
applicant said that
he did not intend to do so.
Respondent’s submissions
7 August 2009 the respondent filed written submissions which are set out
“The Applicant, Mr John Steven Zurillo, was the holder of
a registration certificate as a motor salesperson number 2406399 pursuant
Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000
(PAMD Act). Mr Zurillo’s
certificate was due to expire on 16 May 2009.
Mr Zurillo lodged an application to renew his certificate such that the
Industry Licensing Unit in Brisbane received it on 12 May
In his application, Mr Zurillo properly declared that he had “been
convicted in Queensland or elsewhere within the preceding
5 years of a serious
offence” by placing a cross in the box for ‘Yes’ in answer to
the question. Mr Zurillo hand
wrote on the bottom of the same page the following
‘ACCUSED OF MISTREATMENT OF A MINOR AND ACCUSED FOR HAVING CHILD
EXPLOITATION IMAGE ON COMPUTER. NO IMPRISONMENT SERVED’
On 26 May 2009, the Queensland Police delivered Mr Zurillo’s
criminal history to the Industry Licencing Unit.
On 27 May 2009, Mr Rashford in exercising his delegated authority of the
Chief Executive, considered Mr Zurillo’s criminal history
and found him
not eligible for registration by operation of section 85 of the PAMD
The Applicant admits he was sentenced on 30 August 2006 for offences of
indecent treatment of a child under 16, and on 14 December
2007 for possessing
child exploitation material.
The grounds for review
Although not states in these terms, the Applicant appears to have applied
to the Tribunal for a review of the Chief Executive’s
decision seeking an
order setting aside that decision and renewing his motor salesperson
certificate.
The Applicant cites various matters relevant to this personal
circumstances and character to support his application for the Tribunal
“reconsider this decision”. In addition, he states he is being
punished again; the convictions have no bearing on
the suitability or functions
of a motor salesperson; he is being deprived of his livelihood.
The difficulty for the Applicant is that neither the Chief Executive in
the original decision, nor the Tribunal has the power to renew
his registration
if section 85 of the PAMD Act applies.
The Legislation
The Chief Executive’s power to renew or refuse to renew registration
certificates is contained in Section 95 of the PAMD Act
which relevantly
provides as follows:
‘95 Chief executive may renew or refuse to renew registration
certificate
(1) The chief executive must consider the renewal application and may
renew or refuse to renew the registration certificate.
(2) The chief executive may renew the certificate only if the chief
executive is satisfied—
(a) the registered employee is a suitable person; and
Chapter 2, Part 4 of the PAMD Act is titled “Part 4 Suitability of
applicants and licensees”, and contains the relevant
provisions relevant
to determining whether a person is “a suitable person.” Section 86
in that part states the Chief
Executive must consider the person’s
criminal history when deciding whether a person is a suitable person to obtain
registration
as a registered employee. Section 86 relevantly provides:
‘86 Chief executive must consider suitability of applicants
(1) The chief executive must, when deciding whether a person is a
suitable person to obtain registration as a registered employee,
consider the
following things—
(f) the person’s criminal
Once the Chief Executive has considered the contents of a person’s
criminal history, section 85 may determine that the person
is not suitable for
registration without the need to consider the other matters listed in section
86. Section 85 relevantly provides:
‘85 Suitability of applicants
(1) A person is not a suitable person to obtain registration as a
registered employee if the person is—
(a) a person who has been convicted, in Queensland or elsewhere, within
the preceding 5 years of a serious offence; or
(2) An individual who is not a suitable person can not obtain
registration as a registered employee.’
The term “serious offence” is defined in the dictionary
contained in Schedule 2 of the PAMD Act as:
‘serious offence means any of the following offences punishable by 3
or more years imprisonment—
(d) an offence of a sexual nature;’
The phrase “an offence of a sexual nature” is not defined in
the PAMD Act. In the context of criminal offences, the phrase
has an inclusive
mean under the
Criminal Law Amendment Act 1945
which states:
‘2A Interpretation
(1) In this Act— offence of a sexual nature includes any offence
constitutedwholly or partly by an act whereby the offender
has exhibited a
failure to exercise proper control over the offender’s sexual instincts
and any offence in the circumstances
associated with the committal whereof the
offender has exhibited a failure to exercise such proper control over the
sexual instincts, and includes an assault of a sexual
(2) This section shall be read as one with the Criminal Code and the
Justices Act 1886
The Applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court at Townsville on 14
December 2007 to one count of possessing child exploitation
material on of 9
March 2006. The offence provision contained in the Criminal Code is as
‘228D Possessing child exploitation material
A person who knowingly possesses child exploitation material commits a
Maximum penalty—5 years imprisonment’
The definition of “child exploitation material” for the
purposes of Chapter 22 which includes 2280 is as follows:
‘207A Definitions for this chapter
In this chapter— child exploitation material means material that, in
a way likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult, describes
someone who is, or apparently is, a child under 16 years—
(a) in a sexual context, including for example, engaging in a sexual
activity; or
(b) in an offensive or demeaning context; or (c) being subjected to abuse,
cruelty or torture.’
The Applicant was convicted upon his own plea of guilty in the Magistrates
Court at Townsville on 30th August 2006 that on 3 separate
occasions between
16.2.06 and 02.03.06 he wilfully exposed a child under 16 to an indecent object
or any indecent film etc under
section 210(1 )(e) of the Criminal Code. Section
210(1)(e) relevantly states:
‘210 Indecent treatment of children under 16
(1) Any person who—
(e) without legitimate reason, wilfully exposes a child under the age of
16 years to any indecent object or any indecent film, videotape,
picture, photograph or printed or written matter;
(2) If the child is of or above the age of 12 years, the offender is
guilty of a crime, and is liable to imprisonment for 14 years.’
Application of the legislation
The Applicant admits he was convicted of the 4 offences shown above. It is
not in dispute that those offences occurred in Queensland
or that he was
convicted within the preceding 5 years.
The delegate of the Chief Executive found that both of the offences
committed by the Applicant were offences within the definition
of “serious
offence” such that he is disentitled to be registered as a registered
employee under the PAMD Act.
With respect to the 3 offences of indecent treatment of a child under 16,
it is an element of the offence under section 210(1 )(e)
that the child was
exposed to an ‘indecent’ article. Whilst indecency should be
construed in its ordinary meaning, the
Court of Appeal in R vBAS
[2005] QCA 097
adopted the statements made in Harkin v R
(1989) 38 A Crim R296
at 301 on the
proper direction for a question of “indecency” in the context of a
sexual assault. It has been accepted
that to be ‘indecent’, the act
should either contain a sexual connotation, or be accompanied by some intention
part of the assailant to obtain sexual gratification.
By giving effect to the usual meaning of the words in the offence
provision and in light of the approval of Harkin v R, there can
be little doubt
that an offence of indecent treatment under section 210(1)(e) is an offence of a
“sexual nature”.
With respect to the offence of possessing child exploitation material
under section 228D the Respondent it is not apparent from the
information
evidence before the tribunal or otherwise, what the relevant material was
alleged to depict with reference to the definition
in section 207A of the Code
(noted above). The Respondent submits that it is not necessary in the
circumstances to make a finding
in this regard, however, it is submitted that
the material was probably obtained for the purpose of sexual gratification and
to be an offence of a sexual nature.
The Respondent concedes there is an error on the statement of reasons by
referring to section 91 instead of section 95 however it
does not affect the
reasoning process nor the ultimate outcome.
As the matter is to be decided on the papers, the Respondent does not seek
applicant’s submissions do not deal with the requirements of the relevant
legislation, which bind the Chief Executive and
the Tribunal.
accept the submissions of the respondent.
95 of the Act permits renewal of a registration certificate only if the
applicant is a suitable person.
85 of the Act statutorily renders an applicant for registration under the Act
not suitable if the person has been convicted
within the previous five (5) years
of a serious offence.
