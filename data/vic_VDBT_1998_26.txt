SECOND CROSS RESPONDENT
REASONS FOR DETERMINATION
1. On 7 August 1997 after conducting a five day hearing I made an order
awarding the Applicant (Metricon Homes Pty Ltd) the builder,
$21,147.27 which was made up of the balance found to be due to Metricon under
the contract less an amount recovered by
the Respondents under the Cross
Application of $3,880 plus interest of $3,940.95. At that time I also dismissed
the Burnell’s
claim against HGFL and awarded costs in favour of HGFL to be
assessed on Scale D of the County Court Scale. Those costs were to
be fixed by
the Tribunal in default of agreement. At that time the costs of Metricon and
the Burnells were reserved to a date to
be fixed. On 10 October 1997 after
having heard argument I made the following orders.
"1. The Respondent/Cross Applicant pay the costs of the Applicant/Second
Cross Respondent on Scale D of the County Court Costs Scale.
2. The costs of the Applicant/Second Cross Respondent be assessed by the
Law Institute Taxing Service on Scale D of the County Court
incorporation in a final determination by the Tribunal."
2. In each case the Law Institute Costing Service has assessed the quantum of
costs. So far as HGFL is concerned Mr Zervos a solicitor
who appeared for the
Burnells raised no objection to the quantum as assessed by the Law Institute
Costing Service on Scale D of the
County Court Costs Scale. I note that the
original bill of costs prepared by HGFL was for $13,895.80. In respect to
costs I fix the amount of costs at $9,406.10 being the amount so
assessed and in addition I allow a further $376 being the cost of
Institute and $250 being the costs of HGFL for the hearing, on 22 September
1997 making a total of $10,032.10. In addition
I fix the HGFL’s costs of
this application at $400.
3. I now turn to the costs claim of Metricon. The costs order made on
10 October 1997 is in the following terms:
"1. The Respondent/Cross Applicant pay the costs of the Applicant/Second
Cross Respondent on Scale D of the County Court Costs Scale.
2. The costs of the Applicant/Second Cross Respondent be assessed by the
Law Institute Taxing Service on Scale D of the County Court
incorporation in a final determination by the Tribunal."
Metricon’s costs application was supported by an Affidavit sworn
31 March 1998 by its solicitor David Naidoo. That Affidavit
exhibited an
account from Prompt Costing Services for $2,500 in respect to a bill of costs
also exhibited (prepared by Prompt Costing
Services), an assessment of those
costs dated 20 February 1998 by the Law Institute and a letter enclosing a
cheque for $2,100 in
part payment of the Law Institute’s charges. In
addition it exhibited a copy letter to the Tribunal dated 23 March 1998.
requests the Tribunal to fix costs at $41,633 being the costs as assessed by the
Law Institute plus the additional charges of
Prompt Costing Services and the Law
Institute. Although the order I made referred to obtaining an assessment
the Law Institute Taxing Service ...for incorporation in a final determination
by the Tribunal."
it was never my intention to merely rubber stamp the
costs as assessed by the Law Institute or to adopt any procedure which would
prevent the Burnells from objecting to any item of cost or the quantum thereof.
Even if the assessment of costs had been referred
to the Law Institute pursuant
to s94 of the Act to make an assessment as an independent expert it would still
only constitute evidence
before the Tribunal although of a very persuasive
4. In any event I have adopted the procedure of assessing the costs on the
basis that unless Mr Zervos on behalf of his client challenged
an item I have
accepted it as a proper item. Initially Mr Zervos challenged a number of items
in respect of which the Law Institute
had raised queries. Those items were
numbers 10, 11, 58, 67-73, 80, 97, 123 & 159. The numbers refer to the
original Bill of
Costs and the cost assessment prepared by the Law Institute. I
considered each of those items and either Mr Zervos conceded them
satisfied that the item was properly allowable. Mr Zervos also challenged the
claim for general care, skill and attention
(item 189). The Law Institute
allowed a loading on the brief fee of 55% although acknowledging that is the
usual practice of the
County Court Registrar to allow a loading of between 35%
and 45%. Mr Zervos argued that the appropriate rate should be 35%. Having
regard to the matters that were referred to by Mr Schwarz in the course of
argument and to which I will deal with shortly I am satisfied
that a higher than
usual loading is justified. However in my view a loading of 45% is adequate
which would reduce the total amount
of that item by $600 to $2,400.
5. In addition Mr Schwarz claimed an additional sum of $1,899.95 being a
claim for Mrs Anderson’s costs of $146.15 per day over
13 days. Those
costs were not claimed in the bill of costs as a consequence of accidental
omission. I am satisfied that Metricon
is entitled to reasonable compensation
for her absence from the office. On the basis that she would have been able to
have looked
after some of her work during the thirteen days I propose to allow
$1300 for this item. In addition to this item I consider that
the costs of
Prompt Costing Service of $2,800 and the costs of $2,100 are allowable and fair
and reasonable.
6. Mr Schwarz on behalf of Metricon made a number of submissions concerning
the amounts allowed by the Law Institute in respect to
Counsel’s fees. In
particular he argued that the brief fee should be set at a daily fee of $850 and
not on scale on the basis
of a brief and a refresher. In addition he submitted
that in some cases the brief fee allowed by the Law Institute was only for
practice court application when in fact the parties were intending to commence a
hearing and indeed on several of those hearings
witnesses were called. I have
considered Mr Schwarz’s submissions very carefully and I have with two
exceptions come to the
conclusion that I should not increase the amount as
assessed by the Law Institute. Items 57 and 79 of the Bill of Costs relate to
the Counsel’s fees which the Law Institute has referred to the trial
judge. I assess the appropriate fee in each case at $750
resulting in an amount
of $1,236. In assessing the costs I also took into account the letter written
by Mr Schwarz’s instructing
solicitors dated 23 March 1998 in which
the total amount claimed was $36,733 plus the Law Institute’s and the
costs consultants’
fees. If that determination had been made in
accordance with that request there would have been no change to counsel’s
In addition it was within his instructing solicitor’s power to
submit whatever relevant material there was in respect to the
question of the
nature of the hearings to the Law Institute. Accordingly save for the above
adjustment I have not altered the amount
allowed for counsel’s fees by
the Law Institute.
7. As a consequence of the above I allow the following costs and
disbursements in favour of Metricon:-
Costs claimed in letter of 23.7.98 $36,733.00
adjusted items 57 & 79 $1,236
Additional Witness $1,300
adjustment for general care $600
skill and attention
Cost Consultant Fees $2,800
Law Institute
$2,100 $4,900.00
I have not included the prior costs of $3,317.50 as they are already the
subject of a costs order.
8. In addition to the above it seems to me that Metricon has been almost
entirely successful in its costs claim. In those circumstances
appropriate I should allow its costs of the day which I fix at $800.
