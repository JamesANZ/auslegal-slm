Introduction
is an application for an extension of time for the bringing of a claim against
the fund under
section 470
Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act
is substantially out of time as the relevant sale occurred in March 2003 and the
applicant admits to becoming aware of his alleged
financial loss in August 2005.
The present proceedings were not commenced until 7 July 2009. Under
of PAMDA, the claim is almost three years out of time.
basis of the claim is alleged misleading conduct by the respondent real estate
agent. The house in question, a residential property
at Northgate, was
advertised as a four-bedroom home. The applicant inspected it and it
a four-bedroom home, but one of the bedrooms had a ceiling height of only 2.2
metres. The significance of this was not apparent
to anyone until a few years
later when the applicant decided to re-sell the house. When he did so his new
real estate agent advised
him that he could only advertise it as a three bedroom
applicant has not seen fit to advise the Tribunal of the price he obtained upon
resale which apparently occurred during October
2005, but in the
respondent’s submissions it is asserted that the property was sold
for a considerable profit in or around October 2005
a profit of $131,000.00 representing an increase in sales value of 28.5% over a
period of 31 months.
basis of the claim is “
we are seeking to be reimbursed for the sum of
$15,000.00 being for compensation of the loss of value not being able to promote
sell 101 Ridge Street as a four bedroom home and therefore having to
advertise it as a three bedroom home
”. There is also an allegation of
misrepresentation concerning activities that might occur in an adjoining
child-minding centre.
applicant’s claim misunderstands the nature of the

alleged misleading conduct or false representations which

“471A Claims limited to realised loss
(1) A person may make a claim against the fund for financial loss
relating to a non-investment residential property purchased by
because of, or arising out of, a marketeering contravention only to the extent
the loss is capital loss.
(2) Also, capital loss mentioned in subsection (1) may be claimed only if
the loss has been realised as mentioned in
section 488B.
“488B General test for working out loss

, the financial loss is the amount of the
difference between the contract price or value for the property paid by the
claimant and
the contract price or value for the sale of the property by the
claimant (the

financial loss
there has been little or no attempt to explain the substantial delay in this
matter beyond the mere assertion in the applicant’s
submissions that
due to stress and professional medical advice, I was unable to pursue
this matter in the time frame required
Furthermore,
the submissions of the respondent’s solicitors suggest that the
respondents are seriously prejudiced in responding
adequately to the claim
because of the time that has elapsed. The principal officer of the company has
retired and the respondent
company is no longer trading. The sales person who
had conduct of the marketing of the property at the relevant time no longer

company cannot locate its original sales file.
