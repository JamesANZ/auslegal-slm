Quarterly Council Meeting
Recent Articles about the Council
The following resolution was passed by the Council at its quarterly meeting
in Sydney on 28 August:
“The Press Council reaffirms its confidence in the Chair and rejects
the recent misrepresentations made by The Australian about
the Chair and the
Council. It also deplores the breach by The Australian of obligations of
confidentiality during the Council’s
complaint processes. The Council will
continue to work with News Corp to resolve any legitimate concerns.”
The resolution was passed by 19 votes to nil, with one abstention.
Misrepresentations
A substantial number of recent misrepresentations by The Australian were
identified at the meeting. They included:
• incorrectly reporting a number of important aspects of the
Council’s General Principles; claiming they have recently
become more
restrictive about expressions of opinion; and attributing them to the Chair
rather than a unanimous vote by the 23 Council
• incorrectly describing Council adjudications as if they can prohibit
or require the publication of any particular material,
and as if they are made
by the Chair rather than an Adjudication Panel of five or more people;
• incorrectly describing particular adjudications as if upholding
complaints about matters of opinion; misstating the impact
adjudications by omitting or distorting key passages; and misrepresenting the
Council’s handling of particular complaints;
• incorrectly describing the nature of some complaints, the
Council’s submission to the Finkelstein Inquiry, and the Council’s
attitude towards freedom of speech.
Breaches of confidentiality
A substantial number of breaches of confidentiality by The Australian were
also identified at the meeting. They involved publication
of details of the
handling of complaints while they are still under consideration by the
The breaches included disclosure of the wording of particular complaints and
the publication’s responses to them; statements
and questions by
complainants, publications and Adjudication Panel members in the course of
meetings with the Panel; and other communications
between the Council and the
publication in question. Some of the breaches related to complaints about other
News Corp publications
and appear to have been made with their consent.
In some instances the disclosure was misleading and in some it unfairly
disadvantaged the complainant. The Council’s processes
have also been
severely disrupted. The Chair and Executive Director were asked to take urgent
action aimed at restoring the publications’
compliance with the
confidentiality obligations.
Editing of responses
Great concern was also expressed at the meeting about the editing or
exclusion of material sent to The Australian which was in support
Council. Despite the great number and length of articles and editorials which
criticised the Council (totalling more than
15,000 words), the newspaper edited
out a number of key words from concise letters by the Chair and Vice-Chairs as
well as declining
to publish the letter from one of the two former Chairs who
wrote in support of the Council and an article by a journalist member
Other matters at the Council meeting
The Council was informed that the proportion of complaints open for more than
three months has halved over the past year, and almost
30 per cent of complaints
are now finalised within four weeks or less.
The new Executive Director, John Pender, is overseeing a number of changes to
further increase the proportion of complaints which
are finalised within twenty
days, and of those which are substantially dealt with in a day or two. The
changes also aim to improve
early communication with publications about the
nature of the response being sought to particular complaints. He will make a
report to the next meeting and also introduce changes to accelerate
completion of matters after they have been considered by the
Adjudication
The Council was provided with a number of examples of why, like its
counterparts in the UK and New Zealand, it should continue to
complaints by people who are not identified in or directly impacted by the
material in question. A substantial proportion
of complaints to the Council are
these so-called “third party” complaints, but recent statistical
analysis confirms they
are much less likely than other complaints to go past the
initial stage of consideration, especially to the stage of adjudication
only seven in the first half of 2014). An audit of the handling of these
complaints is being conducted by industry and public
members of Council.
Round Table consultations will be held with senior editors from the
Council’s publisher members in October and with leading
members of the
community in November. The meetings are expected to focus mainly on providing
further information about the operation
of the complaints-handling system,
including adjudications, and inviting suggestions for improvement. They will
also discuss ways
of effectively disseminating the recently-revised General
Principles and dispelling misconceptions about them.
The Executive Director, with the assistance of two Council members (Campbell
Reid and Julie Kinross), will be preparing a paper for
the next Council meeting
on possible new initiatives about freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
Work is continuing on the
Council’s important project on application of
the General Principles to different forms of digital publishing. Two successful
Round Tables have been held and further consultations will occur when drafting
The Council expressed its appreciation to Prue Innes and Prof Ron Grunstein,
whose terms as Council members have expired. It appointed
Felicity Lewis,
current President of the Australian Local Government Association, as a public
member for three years from 28 August
2014. It also appointed Sue Carter (former
Head of News and Editorial of Yahoo!7) and David Fagan (former Editor in Chief
Courier Mail) as industry members of the Adjudication Panel for two years
from 1 September 2014.
