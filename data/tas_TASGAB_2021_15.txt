Evidence and Determination
Request for an Emergency Guardianship Order (‘the Request’) was
accompanied by:
letter addressed to ‘Dental Surgeon’, from Dr Shaunagh Jones, dated
29 January 2020.
Note in relation to directed enquiries made by the Board Registry, dated 3 March
Application states that ‘COVID-19 Public Health team scheduled to
vaccinate [the Aged Care Facility] residents on site Wednesday
March 2021.’
is well known, the Federal Government commenced a nationwide COVID-19
vaccination program in late February 2021. The vaccination
rollout is to occur
in a number of phases over the coming months, giving certain people priority for
vaccination. In the initial
phase of the rollout, priority is given to residents
and staff at aged and disability residential care facilities. Vaccination of
residents in those facilities is understood to have commenced.
COVID-19 vaccine may be administered to a person who is capable of giving
consent to it. It can also be administered to a person
incapable of understanding the general nature and effect of the
proposed vaccination;
is incapable of indicating whether he or she consents or does not consent to
the vaccination.
who has a substitute decision maker who may consent on their behalf. Whether
consent is given to the vaccine or not is up to the person
or their substitute
decision maker.
Application asserts that OH is unable to give consent to the vaccination and
requires a substitute decision-maker.
Board needs to consider the statutory criteria in section 20 of the Act and be
satisfied that OH may have a disability, and if
so that by reason of disability
he is unable to make reasonable judgements in respect of decisions pertaining to
medical treatment.
Applicant, a registered nurse at [the Aged Care Facility], advises that OH has
Alzheimer’s dementia. The Applicant states
OH ‘lacks insight and
requires multiple physical and verbal prompts to follow instruction due to
cognitive impairments’.
The Applicant also states OH is ‘unable to
make an informed decision’. A letter from Dr Shaunagh Jones, [the Medical
Centre] advises that OH has ‘Alzheimers Disease’ and ‘his
understanding of conversation and explanation is limited.’
The Board is
persuaded that OH
have a disability and
by reason of it be
unable to make reasonable judgments pertaining to medical treatment.
Board also needs to be satisfied there
be a need for the appointment
of a guardian.
a person has a guardian (enduring guardian or Board appointed) then the guardian
can provide consent to medical treatment if they
have a power to make decisions
pertaining to medical treatment,
or as Person Responsible.
Request states that OH does not have the Public Guardian appointed as his
guardian and a search of the Enduring Guardian Register
does not indicate OH has
a registered enduring guardian instrument appointing a guardian. The Applicant
states OH’s wife is
unable to give consent and there is no other person
named in the Application who could act as Person Responsible.
the Act there is the ability for a medical practitioner to provide medical
treatment which is not special treatment:
to a person to
whom Part 6 of the Act applies; and
where there is no person responsible; and
where the treatment is necessary and is the form of treatment that will most
successfully promote the person’s health and well-being;
where the person does not object to the treatment.
The medical practitioner must certify these factors in the person’s
medical record.
question of whether a vaccination is ‘necessary medical treatment’
would need to be considered carefully by the medical
practitioner seeking to
provide treatment. If it is deemed the vaccination is not ‘necessary
medical treatment’ then
an application for consent for medical treatment
or application for guardianship may need to be made to the Board.
the Request before the Board, there is no evidence that any medical practitioner
has made an assessment that the vaccination is
necessary medical treatment, or a
medical practitioner is likely to make such an assessment. In the absence of
that it appears the
only avenue for substitute consent to be considered is by
application to the Board for medical consent or for a guardianship order.
Board determines on the evidence before it, before it that there may be a need
for a guardian to be appointed.
Board must be satisfied that ‘by reasons of urgency’ there may be
grounds for making a guardianship order. The relevant
issue is whether a
guardian needs to be appointed urgently to consider whether OH should receive
the COVID 19 vaccination.
Applicant states that the COVID-19 vaccination provided by the Public Health
Team is scheduled to vaccinate residents at [the
Aged Care Facility] on
Wednesday 10
March 2021. Directed enquiries by Registry revealed
that the COVID-19 vaccination requires two injections. There was no evidence
before the Board to suggest that OH would be deprived of the opportunity to
receive the vaccine if he did not receive it on the 19
March 2021. The
Applicant conceded it may be possible for OH to have his first dose when Public
Health returns to give other patients
at the facility the second dose. There may
also be an option for him to access it through his General Practitioner or at a
health clinic, if it is determined he should receive it.
the time of determination of this Request there was no known current active
cases of COVID-19 in Tasmania. There was no evidence
before the Board as to
what implications, including possible medical implications exist if OH did not
receive the vaccination straight
the Applicant believes the appointment of a guardian is needed then an
Application for Guardianship can be made. Alternatively
consideration can be
given to making an Application for Consent to Medical Treatment. This process
ensures procedural fairness is
afforded to OH and parties to the Application.
Board is not satisfied on the evidence before it that there are reasons for
urgency for a guardianship order to be made. There
is no evidence that OH will
be denied the vaccination if he does not receive it at the time of the Public
Health team’s first
visit, and therefore ‘mere convenience’ is
not sufficient grounds to make an order.
Guardianship and Administration Board Orders that the Request for an Emergency
Guardianship Order is dismissed.
