Access as Executor [2006] NSWPrivCmr 13 (1 July 2006)
Access as Executor
T contacted Privacy NSW with a complaint regarding access to T’s
deceased parent’s health records. T’s parent had
been a resident at
an Aged Care facility for a number of years before their death, and T, as
executor of the Estate, was seeking
access to a file.
T sent three written requests to the facility asking for a copy of the file.
T received a response to the first request, which informed
T that the request
was being refused. T received no response to the following two letters. T then
made a complaint to Privacy NSW
alleging a breach of the
Health Records and
Information Privacy Act 2002
(the HRIP Act).
Both the HRIP Act and the
(Cth.) deal with health
information and the private sector. Part 4 of the HRIP Act deals specifically
with the application of the
Health Privacy Principles to private sector persons
such as medical practitioners, private hospitals and nursing homes. The
complainant
chose to ask Privacy NSW to handle their complaint.
Section 8 of the HRIP Act allows for an ‘authorised
representative’ to make a decision on behalf of another person, for
example, to request their medical records under Part 4 of the HRIP Act. The
‘authorised representative’ can be someone
who is authorised by law
to act for or represent another person, such as, an executor on administration
of a deceased estate.
By virtue of Section 27 of the HRIP Act, a private sector person must respond
to a request for access within 45 days, and must provide
a reason for any
refusal of access.
explained to the facility its obligations under the HRIP
Act. Upon receipt of
the letter the facility granted T access to the file. If the facility had
continued to refuse T access to the
file, the Privacy Commissioner could have
elected to prepare a report under Section 47 of the HRIP Act which would have
any of the Commissioner’s findings or recommendations in regard
to this matter and allowed the complainant to take their complaint
Administrative Decisions Tribunal. This instance was an example, however, of the
effectiveness of a conciliatory intervention
by Privacy NSW and amounted to
merely reminding an organisation of its obligations under the Act.
