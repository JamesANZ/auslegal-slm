Upon the basis of the Court’s orders, the applicant is the successful
party. The respondent submits, however, that it is
appropriate to award costs
with reference to the results upon different issues. The different issues are
submitted to be those arising
upon three of the six grounds of the application
for leave to appeal. The Court upheld two grounds, one ground was resolved in
of the respondent, and the Court did not find it necessary to decide the
remaining grounds. The respondent advances various arguments
in support of its
contention that the respondent should pay some of the applicant’s costs
and the applicant should pay some
of the respondent’s costs in this Court

Upon the applicant’s application, this Court resolved the issue of

the respondent’s arguments for awarding costs with reference to
separate issues are not persuasive. In particular, the statutory

bringing an application for summary judgment in the teeth of an apparently
