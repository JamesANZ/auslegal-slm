Introduction
costs were paid by the appellant, Dr Gray, for work done by the respondent
law firm, Lavan, under retainer agreements. The
agreements imposed binding
obligations upon Dr Gray to pay those costs. Under the
Legal Practice
(WA), Lavan had no right to retain any part of any payment if, and
to the extent that, the payment was found on a taxation to exceed
authorised by a certificate from a taxing officer.
to a taxation of costs, in 2018 Dr Gray and Lavan reached a settlement. The
settlement deed required repayment by Lavan of
$900,000 as "the amount that
would have been ordered to be refunded" to Dr Gray if there had been a
taxation. The parties agreed
to leave open the option of litigating the question
of whether Dr Gray had a claim against Lavan for interest on the $900,000.
Gray commenced proceedings, submitting that Lavan was unjustly enriched
by the opportunity to use the $900,000 over the period from
payment until
repayment due to the failure of the basis or condition upon which that $900,000
had been paid. Dr Gray claimed an entitlement
to interest (including
compound interest) over that period.
primary judge and the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Western Australia
rejected Dr Gray's claim for interest (whether
compound or simple
interest). That conclusion was correct. There is a strong basis to conclude, as
Dr Gray submitted in this Court,
that as a matter merely of the agreement
of the parties, the retainer agreements included a condition subsequent to the
effect that
Lavan would have no right to retain the amount of any payment to the
extent that the payment was more than that authorised by a taxation
Legal Practice Act
. Be that as it may, however, the provisions of the
Legal Practice Act
formed a comprehensive regime for recovery of the
principal sum paid for legal costs over the amount certified by a taxing
and interest on that sum, to the exclusion of any common law claim for
restitution. Those provisions did not provide for interest
to be payable by a
law firm on those excess amounts for the period prior to the grant of a
certificate. And those provisions left
no room for a common law restitutionary
claim for principal or interest consequent upon such excess amounts. The
settlement deed
aimed to replicate the effect of a taxation pursuant to those
provisions and did not create any restitutionary claim.
facts from which this dispute arose are uncontroversial. In 2005, the appellant,
Dr Gray, retained a law firm, Bennett &
Co, to act for him in Federal
Court of Australia proceedings against the University of Western Australia
(WAD 292). Bennett &
Co charged Dr Gray for work done under a
written costs agreement. The written costs agreement between Dr Gray and
Bennett & Co
provided for matters including the hourly rates at which fees
would be calculated and various arrangements with respect to billing.
agreement also provided that:
"You must pay for [Bennett & Co's] services in accordance with invoices sent
by [Bennett & Co] even though not all of the
legal services referred to in
Item 1 of the Schedule have been performed.
Accounts are rendered on a regular basis, usually monthly. Each account rendered
to you by [Bennett & Co] entitles you to exercise
any of your statutory
rights either to have the account itemised or taxed and you must do so within
30 days of receipt of each account.
[Bennett & Co] acknowledges your right to require [Bennett & Co] to
itemise each account for taxation even if you decide
to exercise your statutory
rights only on receipt of the final account issued by [Bennett & Co]."
The covering letter to Dr Gray accompanying the written costs agreement
"You should be aware that the
Legal Practitioners
gives you the right to have the Costs Agreement and our invoices
reviewed for their fairness and reasonableness even though you have
Costs Agreement."
March 2006, Bennett & Co ceased its business of providing legal services. In
April 2006, Lavan employed the former principals
and employees of Bennett &
Co in its practice. This included Mr Bennett. Shortly after Lavan had
employed the former principals
and employees of Bennett & Co, Dr Gray
engaged Lavan to perform legal work in relation to the Federal Court proceedings
as two separate proceedings in the Supreme Court of Western Australia
(CIV 2022 and CIV 2275). Between 1 August 2006 and 29 June
Dr Gray paid Lavan for the provision of legal work.
the legal work performed by Lavan included work on the same Federal Court
proceedings for which Bennett & Co had performed
work under a written costs
agreement, the legal work done for Dr Gray by Lavan was not performed under
a written costs agreement.
Nevertheless, there was no dispute at trial or on
appeal that the retainer agreements between Dr Gray and Lavan ("the
Retainer Agreements")
included terms, established orally or by conduct, that:
(i) Lavan would provide legal services to Dr Gray; (ii) Lavan
would charge
Dr Gray on the same basis that Dr Gray had been charged by
Bennett & Co; and (iii) Dr Gray would pay Lavan in accordance with
invoices rendered by Lavan. Lavan invoiced Dr Gray for the legal services
that it provided. Between around September 2006 and 29
Dr Gray paid those invoices by a number of separate payments. The total of
those payments was $4,353,707.98 for the Federal
Court proceedings and
$123,360.35 for the two Supreme Court proceedings. Disputes arose between, on
the one hand, Dr Gray and, on
the other hand, Mr Bennett and Lavan.
The disputes relevantly concerned the payment of Lavan's invoices, and the
taxation of Lavan's
fees and disbursements.
March 2015, Dr Gray, Mr Bennett, and Lavan entered a settlement deed which
resolved all disputes between them except for a dispute
of costs concerning the three sets of proceedings. The parties to the 2015
settlement deed anticipated that
the dispute about the bills of costs would be
resolved by a taxation of the disputed bills of costs in the Supreme Court of
Australia. It seems to have been assumed that the taxation would not
merely be of the costs of the two proceedings in the Supreme
Court but also of
the costs of the proceedings in the Federal Court. It was an agreed fact at
trial that around 29 October 2015,
Lavan filed the bills of costs for
taxation in the Supreme Court of Western Australia.
taxation of any of the bills of costs took place. Instead, on 13 July 2018,
Dr Gray's application for taxation was compromised
by a deed of settlement.
The 2018 settlement deed recited that the parties "agreed to settle all
remaining disputes between them
other than the Interest Dispute and how the
Interest Dispute is to be litigated or resolved".
2018 settlement deed included terms in cl 2 (read with the definitions in
cl 1.1) for payment by Lavan to Dr Gray of a "Taxation
Settlement Sum"
of $900,000, inclusive of costs and disbursements. Clause 2 provided for
that sum to be paid in three instalments
of $300,000 and for the obligation
expressed to be "without otherwise making any admissions" and subject to
cl 3 (dealing with the
interest dispute). The final instalment of $300,000
was to be paid within six months of the date of execution of the 2018 settlement
2018 settlement deed defined "Interest Dispute" in cl 1.1 as the dispute
between the parties referred to in cl 3.1. Clause 3.1
Acknowledgments
The Parties acknowledge that:
(a) the Taxation Settlement Sum represents the amount that would have been
ordered to be refunded to Gray by Lavan if there had
been a taxation of the
(b) the Taxation Settlement Sum does not include interest;
(c) Gray claims that he is entitled to and therefore has a claim to interest on
the Taxation Settlement Sum;
(d) Lavan disputes that it has any liability to pay interest to Gray on the
Taxation Settlement Sum; and
(e) the issue whether Gray has a claim to interest on the Taxation Settlement
Sum remains in dispute between the Parties."
cl 3.2 (read with the definitions in cl 1.1), the parties agreed that,
at any time prior to the "Sunset Date" of six months after
the 2018 settlement
deed took effect, Dr Gray "may commence the Interest Dispute Action"
(defined to mean "an action in the Court
to litigate the Interest Dispute") but
that if that action were not commenced within that six-month period then Lavan
no liability to Dr Gray for the Interest Claim. By cl 12,
the deed took effect upon the parties' exchange of dated and signed counterparts
of the deed, which occurred on or about 13 July 2018.
Claim" was defined very broadly as "any allegation, debt, cause of action,
liability, claim, contribution, indemnity, proceedings,
suit or demand of any
nature, whether present or future, fixed or unascertained, actual or contingent,
and whether at law, in equity,
under statute or otherwise that Gray has against
Lavan to recover interest on fees paid by Gray to Lavan that has been agreed are
refundable by Lavan to Gray".
3.3 provided that if an Interest Dispute Action were commenced "(a) then
the net amount in legal fees which Lavan would have
been obliged to refund to
Gray had there been a taxation is the Taxation Settlement Sum;
(b) the Taxation Settlement Sum is the amount
on which Gray claims
that interest is to be calculated for the purposes of the Interest Dispute
Action; (c) for the purposes of the
Interest Dispute Action it is agreed that
the date of the taxation at which the Taxation Settlement Sum would have been
be refunded to Gray by Lavan is the date the final tranche of the
Taxation Settlement Sum is paid". The final tranche of the Taxation
Sum was paid on 13 January 2019.
the six months contemplated by the 2018 settlement deed, on 21 December
2018, Dr Gray commenced proceedings in the Supreme
Court of Western
Australia by writ of summons to recover interest on the $900,000. In the Supreme
Court proceedings concerning the
interest, Dr Gray pleaded, and Lavan
admitted, that "the effect of the entry into the 2018 Settlement Deed was that
the parties agreed
to proceed ... as if there had been a taxation of the Bills
[and] on the basis that a taxing officer had certified that Dr Gray had
overpaid the Taxation Settlement Sum to Lavan".
Dr Gray had made various payments to Lavan, the litigation was conducted on
the simplified basis that, for the purposes of
the claim to interest, all
payments had been made on 30 June 2008. Dr Gray claimed compound
interest, or alternatively simple interest,
on the $900,000 over the period from
30 June 2008, which was the simplified date of payment of the fees to
Lavan, until 13 January
2019, which was the date of payment of the final
tranche of the $900,000 and the date at which it was agreed that Lavan should be
deemed to have been required by a taxation to repay $900,000.
relevant statutory provisions concerning legal costs
the time of the Retainer Agreements between Dr Gray and Lavan (and also at
the time of the payments under those Retainer Agreements,
the last of which was
made on 29 June 2008) the relevant legislation in Western Australia was
Legal Practice Act
. Although the
Legal Practice
was repealed on 1 March
a transitional
provision of the new legislation continued the operation of
Legal Practice Act
in circumstances where, as here, "the client first
instructed the law practice in the matter before [1 March

was entitled "Costs". Division 3 of
was concerned with "Taxation and recovery of costs". Some provisions
of Div 3 were concerned only with written costs
agreements,
also covered bills of costs issued pursuant to unwritten costs agreements, such
as the Retainer Agreements. The various
time requirements in Div 3 were
subject to the power of a taxing officer to enlarge
Section 231(1)
provided that a "legal practitioner must include in each bill of costs for a
lump sum" a notice that provided:

writing to provide to you an itemised bill of costs the
subject of this account.
Within 30 days of receiving an itemised bill of costs, you may require me

empowered a person charged with a bill of costs that contains detailed items to
serve upon the legal practitioner,
within 30 days of service of that bill,
a written notice of intention to have the bill taxed and, upon service of that
have the bill taxed by a taxing officer. Section 240 governed
the approach to be taken on a taxation as follows:
Certification, interest, amount, how recovered
(1) The taxing officer must certify in writing the amount at which a bill of
costs, and the costs of and incidental to the taxation
of the bill of costs, are
respectively allowed by the taxing officer.
(2) A certificate under subsection (1) is binding and conclusive on both
(3) A certificate under subsection (1) bears interest, and may be enforced by
either party against the person liable to pay, as
if it were a judgment of the
Supreme Court for the payment of the amount mentioned in the certificate."
Section 242
provided for the Supreme Court's power to review the taxation of a bill of
costs, with an order made upon review to be
enforceable in the same manner as
the certificate of a taxing officer. Section 243 was concerned with the
restitution of amounts
paid which exceeded the amount allowed by the taxing
Overpayments to be returnable
If a bill of costs is taxed under this Division and, as a result of that
taxation, the amount which has been paid or deducted in
respect of that bill is
more than the amount authorised by the taxation, to the extent of the excess,
the person charged has a claim
for repayment which may be certified and enforced
under section 240 as though allowed under that section."
The proceedings and decisions in the Supreme Court and the Court of
basis of Dr Gray's claim for compound interest in the courts below was
clarified as the proceedings progressed, although at all
stages his claim has
relied heavily upon the provisions of the
Legal Practice Act
Dr Gray's case (as initially pleaded), Dr Gray relied upon a primary
claim that "at no time was Lavan entitled to charge Dr Gray
the Taxation
Settlement Sum" (relevantly defined in the 2018 settlement deed as "the sum of
$900,000.00"). Alternatively, Dr Gray
claimed that Lavan's entitlement to
charge Dr Gray the "Taxation Settlement Sum" ceased when the parties
entered into the 2018 settlement
deed. But Dr Gray's case at trial did not rely
on his primary claim. Instead, his case at trial accepted that the Retainer
between Dr Gray and Lavan "entitled Lavan to charge and obliged
Dr Gray to pay the [invoiced]
Dr Gray's case
at trial was limited to a claim that the entry into the 2018 settlement deed
"removed the legal justification of Lavan
to charge and retain" $900,000 of the
invoiced and paid amounts.
Lavan was said to have been unjustly enriched when the parties entered into the
2018 settlement deed.
primary judge in the Supreme Court of Western Australia (Curthoys J)
dismissed Dr Gray's claim. His Honour held that there had
been no failure
of basis or condition for Dr Gray's payments of invoices issued under the
Retainer Agreements and that the entry
into the 2018 settlement deed and the
payment of $900,000 under that deed did not involve any unjust
enrichment.
His Honour also
held, in any event, that compound interest was not generally available in a
restitutionary claim, either at common
and that, unlike
this case, those authorities which had recognised such general availability had
required that the principal be retained
the Court of Appeal, Dr Gray's case was further refined. Dr Gray
submitted that the legal basis for his payment of $900,000 failed
at the time of
the "deemed taxation" under the 2018 settlement deed. The date of the deemed
taxation was the date of payment of the
last tranche of repayments under the
2018 settlement deed.
Dr Gray relied upon the failure of the legal basis for payment of $900,000
of the invoiced amounts for his claim that Lavan was required
restitution to Dr Gray of both the principal sum of $900,000 as well as
interest (including compound interest) for the period
of time from payment by
Dr Gray of the amounts comprising the $900,000.
Court of Appeal dismissed Dr Gray's appeal. In a joint judgment,
Buss P and Mitchell JA held that there was no failure of the
condition of payments under the Retainer Agreements. Their Honours held that, at
least in the circumstances where the invoiced
work had been performed and the
amounts invoiced were not shown to exceed any applicable costs determination,
Lavan "had a contractual
entitlement to issue the invoices" which Dr Gray
"had a contractual obligation to pay". There was no failure of the basis of the
payment under that obligation; the retainers entitled Lavan to "receive and
retain [the payments] until required by a taxing officer's
certificate to make a
repayment to

determined on the basis, accepted by the parties, that
at the time Lavan

Dr Gray was obliged to pay them under the
terms of the Retainer
Agreements.

Legal Practice Act

Vandongen JA also dismissed the appeal for two independent
reasons which
were not reflected in the approach of Buss P and Mitchell JA. First,
Vandongen JA held that there was no failure of

$900,000 because the total of the payments of the invoices was an indivisible
amount and there was no relevant
payment or transaction by which the $900,000
was paid by Dr Gray to

Honour considered that Dr Gray did not make payments to Lavan on a basis or

reasons was the subject of a notice of contention and it is unnecessary to
address them specifically.
The issues in this Court
this Court, Dr Gray sought to have orders substituted for the orders of the
Court of Appeal, to the effect of requiring Lavan
to pay him $1,450,680.82, as
"compound interest on the sum of $900,000 for the period between 30 June 2008
and the dates of repayment
of that sum". Dr Gray also sought further simple
interest on that amount of compound interest at 6% under
Supreme Court Act 1935

to the date of judgment.
relied upon two grounds of appeal, both of which are necessary for him to
succeed. First, he asserted that the Court of Appeal
erred in holding that there
had been no failure of the basis at common law leading to the unjust enrichment
by Lavan in its
of the $900,000. That ground of appeal requires
Dr Gray to establish that he had a common law restitutionary remedy for
Secondly, Dr Gray asserted that the Court of Appeal erred in
holding that, if he had a common law right to restitution of the $900,000,
Lavan's retention and use of the $900,000 did not give rise to an obligation at
common law to pay interest.
submission on the first ground of appeal was further refined during the oral
hearing in this Court. The submission became
as follows: Lavan had been unjustly
enriched by the opportunity to use $900,000 of the payments of legal costs made
by Dr Gray (from
the simplified date of Dr Gray's payment on
30 June 2008 until the dates of repayment) because that $900,000 had been
paid pursuant
to a conditional obligation in each Retainer Agreement to pay the
fees charged, and the condition of that obligation had subsequently
Dr Gray submitted that the condition of Lavan's legal entitlement to retain
the fees charged would have failed to the extent
that the fees were not
certified as allowed costs upon a taxation of the bills of costs under
Legal Practice Act
. Dr Gray then submitted that
the effect of entry into the 2018 settlement deed was to place the parties in
the same position as if
a taxation had occurred by which $900,000 of the
payments made by Dr Gray had not been allowed. Dr Gray accepted at
trial, as he
did in this Court, that any common law claim for restitution from
Lavan of the principal sum of $900,000 could arise only when the
failed because, until that point, the Retainer Agreements "provided a legal
justification for [the]
second ground of appeal asserted that complete restitution of all benefits
obtained by Lavan required (subject to defences)
the repayment not merely of the
amount of the principal sum received but also the value of the opportunity to
use that money, quantified
as interest, from the time when Lavan was not
entitled to retain the payment until it was ordered to be repaid. That
reasoning, in
broad terms, is supported by the decision of a majority of the

the reasons below, Dr Gray's submissions on the first ground of appeal
should not be accepted. In those circumstances, it would
not be appropriate for
this Court to determine, in the abstract, the large question of principle raised
by the second ground. It
is also unnecessary to consider the notice of
contention relied upon by Lavan which asserted that any award of interest prior

common law restitutionary remedy for the $900,000 principal or for its
The proper sequence of analysis
correctly identified the starting point to assess whether, at common law, he was
entitled to interest (including compound
interest) representing the value of
Lavan's opportunity, between 30 June 2008 and various dates ending on
13 January 2019, to use
the payments of principal amounting to $900,000.
That starting point is whether and when, at common law, Dr Gray was
entitled to
restitution from Lavan of the
amount of $900,000.
If Dr Gray was not entitled at common law to restitution of the principal of
$900,000, then he could not be entitled
at common law to restitution of the use
value of that principal of $900,000.
immediate problem for Dr Gray's submissions is that, even on his own case,
the payments amounting to $900,000 were made to Lavan
under conditional
obligations where the condition in each Retainer Agreement did not fail until
13 January 2019 (the date of the
deemed, or fictitious, taxation). Lavan
could not have been unjustly enriched by its
of money that it was
entitled to receive. Hence, even if Dr Gray had a common law claim for
restitution on 13 January 2019, it is
difficult to see how a recipient of
money could be liable to the payer at common law to make restitution of the
value of the opportunity
to use the money during the period in which the
recipient was entitled to retain that money.
Dr Gray's submission that he was entitled to restitution of the principal
sum of $900,000 at common law should be rejected for
a more fundamental reason.
The content of the conditions subsequent upon which Dr Gray relied for his
common law claim for restitution
depends upon the provisions of the
Practice Act
set out above. Those provisions included a regime for recovery
of both principal and interest in circumstances where an amount paid
referable to a lodged bill of costs exceeded the amount certified on a taxation.
That statutory regime did not operate in
tandem with a common law claim for
failure of basis or condition. There is no room for the existence of a separate
common law claim
for restitution where, as here, the obligation to repay relies
on provisions of the statutory regime itself to establish a failure
of basis or
condition of part of the payment obligations.
exclusion of any common law restitutionary claim for principal or interest based
upon a condition subsequent in each Retainer
Agreement arising from the
Practice Act
means that Dr Gray's appeal cannot succeed. The 2018 settlement
deed put the parties in the same position as if there had been a taxation
certificate issued under the
Legal Practice Act
on 13 January 2019
authorising Dr Gray's recovery of $900,000 and that deemed circumstance
could not give rise to any common law
restitutionary consequences.
Restitution at common law for failure of basis or
Redland City Council v
categories of restitution of unjust enrichment were described as including
"unjustified payments of money or performance of services
that benefit another
in circumstances where the benefit was the result of mistake, undue influence,
duress, or an absence or failure
of consideration". For centuries, an element of
a claim for restitution in such cases has been that there is no
justification—that
is, no juristic reason—for the defendant to
retain (or "detain[]"
the benefit.

initially or subsequently fails, this Court

awarded also because the obligation
under which the money was paid can no longer justify the defendant retaining the

"When a contract stipulates for payment of part of the purchase money in
advance, the purchaser relying only on the vendor's promise
to give him a
conveyance, the vendor is entitled to enforce payment before the time has
arrived for conveying the land; yet his title
to retain the money has been
considered not to be absolute but conditional upon the subsequent completion of
the contract."
Dixon J continued, quoting from
to the effect
that once the conveyance will not occur the vendor "from that moment" holds the
money advanced for the use of the purchaser.
The basis or condition of the Retainer Agreements
this Court, Dr Gray's submissions concerning the relevant basis or
condition of payments under the Retainer Agreements were refined
to assertions
that the obligations in the Retainer Agreements to pay the invoiced amounts were
subject to conditions subsequent that
either: (i) a taxation of the costs
established that "the amount charged was fair and reasonable"; or (ii) the
Retainer Agreements
continued to be legally enforceable.
basis or condition for Dr Gray's obligations to make payments under the
Retainer Agreements must be determined objectively by
reference to the terms and
circumstances of the Retainer Agreements. The objective terms and circumstances
of the Retainer Agreements
included the term that Lavan would charge
Dr Gray on the same basis that Dr Gray had been charged by Bennett
& Co, and the term
of the Bennett & Co retainer that reiterated
Dr Gray's statutory right "either to have the account itemised or taxed".
The parties
would also have been reasonably aware from the correspondence
concerning the Bennett & Co retainer that Dr Gray had a right to
bills of costs "reviewed for their fairness and reasonableness".
is therefore a strong basis to conclude that the parties had agreed that each of
the Retainer Agreements included a condition
subsequent, giving effect to the
terms of the
Legal Practice Act
, to the effect that Lavan would have no
right to retain the amount of any payment to the extent that the payment was
more than the
amount authorised by a taxation under the
Legal Practice
. But, even independently of the objective agreement of the parties, that
condition subsequent would have been imposed on the Retainer
Agreements by the
terms of the
Legal Practice Act
itself. The parties could not contract
out of the provisions of the
Legal Practice Act
, set out above, although
requires that effect must be given to a
agreement when taxing an itemised bill of costs (subject to review under
The content of the condition subsequent that governed Dr Gray's obligation
to pay under each of the Retainer Agreements, and Lavan's
right to retain any
payments of invoices under those Retainer Agreements, was therefore, as
Dr Gray accepted, contained in the
Legal Practice Act
. The content
of those conditions subsequent cannot be confined to the consequences of a
taxation under
Legal Practice Act
. For instance,
was itself subject to, and inseparable from, the power of review
Section 240
was also inseparable from the statutory claim
for repayment under
, which therefore also forms part of the
conditions subsequent governing Lavan's entitlement to retain the money paid
under the invoices
issued to Dr Gray.
Importantly,
in their operation as conditions subsequent to the Retainer Agreements, the
provisions of
Legal Practice Act
did not invalidate those
agreements. The Retainer Agreements were consistent with the operation of Pt 13.
As conditions subsequent
their effect was, prospectively, to require, as s 243
was entitled, "[o]verpayments to be returnable".
Practice Act
provided the exclusive remedies for the conditions subsequent in
the Retainer Agreements
content of the condition subsequent in each of the Retainer Agreements was
determined by the regime in
Legal Practice Act
Contrary to Dr Gray's submissions, it is not possible to sever the
operation of some provisions of
from others, to create a common law
restitutionary regime that depends in part upon
and in part upon the
common law. The provision by
for a statutory right of
recovery by a certificate, together with interest from the date of the
certificate, formed a comprehensive
regime for recovery of the principal and
interest arising from the operation of
to the exclusion of any
common law claim for restitution.
imposed a statutory duty to make restitution of
that which the recipient no longer has any right to retain: the principal sum
for legal costs over the amount certified by the taxation together with
statutory interest from the time of the certificate. Those
provisions did not
provide for interest to be payable by a law firm on the principal sum for the
period prior to the grant of a certificate.
Rather, the premise of
was that the recipient of money paid for work done, under invoices
referable to a bill of costs, was entitled to retain that money,
and was not
required to pay interest for its use of that money, until the issue of the
certificate. Further,
did not give the recipient any restitutionary
defence that might be available at common law, such as change of position. The
consequences can "neither be cut down nor enlarged by resort to the
general law or to restitutionary
principles".
The effect of the 2018 settlement deed
2018 settlement deed was intended, by deeming provisions, to replicate the
effect of a taxation of the bills of costs and the
issue of a certificate by a
taxing officer of the Supreme Court certifying that the amount allowed on
taxation was $900,000 less
than the amounts charged by Lavan to Dr Gray,
with the date of the issue of the deemed certificate being the date at which the
repayment instalment was paid by Lavan under the 2018 settlement deed
(namely, 13 January 2019).
effect, by the 2018 settlement deed the parties agreed that the conditions
subsequent governing Lavan's right to retain $900,000
from the amounts paid by
Dr Gray under invoices sent by Lavan would be deemed to have failed because
of the deemed issue of a taxation
certificate on 13 January 2019. Lavan's
admission on the pleadings was, in effect, that under the 2018 settlement deed
the parties
had agreed that Lavan had lost its right to retain $900,000 of the
amounts paid by Dr Gray, on the basis of a fiction that a taxation
certificate had been issued on 13 January 2019.
provision of the 2018 settlement deed provided for any liability of Lavan for
interest, including compound interest, for any period
of time before
13 January 2019. Indeed, this was the very matter that remained in dispute
between the parties. The fiction underlying
the 2018 settlement deed was limited
to the principal sum of $900,000, with repayment in the agreed manner. But even
on the assumption,
admitted by Lavan in its defence, that the 2018 settlement
deed had the effect of deeming that there had been a taxation and that
officer had certified that Dr Gray had overpaid $900,000 to Lavan, no
common law restitutionary remedies existed based on
Lavan's retention of the
Legal Practice Act
excluded any such common law
restitutionary consequences.
circumstances of this appeal are narrow. They involve fees paid for work that
was done under the Retainer Agreements the terms
of which are consistent with
the operation of the relevant statutory scheme in
Legal Practice
. In those circumstances, there is no space for a regime of restitution
at common law to operate concurrently with the conditions
of the statutory
scheme, including for the statutory recovery of amounts paid in excess of the
amount certified following taxation
of a bill of costs, and interest.
