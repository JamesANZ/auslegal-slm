Bernstone, Margaret v Stewards of Greyhound Racing Authority
[2002] QRAA
REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
This appeal was heard by way of
a video link and is against the decision of 17 August 2002 by the Stewards to
suspend Mrs Bernstone
for a period of 3 months and to fine her $500.00 for a
breach of Rule 106 of the Australian
Greyhound Racing Rules
“The Owner, Trainer or person in charge of greyhound
nominated to compete in an Event, shall produce the greyhound for the Event,
free of any Drug.”
On the Notice of Appeal filed in this matter
the Appeal was stated to be against the finding of the Stewards as well as
At the commencement of the hearing Mrs Bernstone was asked her proper
intentions in relation to the Appeal as she did enter a plea
of guilty at the
Stewards inquiry on17 August 2002. Mrs Bernstone advised that she was
proceeding on the basis of penalty only and
when completing the Notice of Appeal
was uncertain of what part of the form to mark in relation to her Appeal. On
the basis of Mrs
Bernstone’s statement this matter is proceeding by way of
Appeal on penalty only.
The dog in question was Here’s Harry
being a dog owned and trained by Mrs Bernstone. The dog had won a maiden race
at the Cairns
Greyhound Racing Club on 22 June 2002. A swab was taken and upon
analysis showed the presence of the drug Diclofenac.
Diclofenac is
described by Dr David Auer, the Director (Racing Integrity Services) Racing
Science Centre as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drug used to reduce pain,
inflammation and fever. Diclofenac is registered for use of humans only and is
the active ingredient in
tablets for human preparation such as Voltaren and
Fenac. Diclofenac is scheduled as an S
drug in the Standard for the
Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons which has been adopted by the
(Drugs and Poisons) Regulation 1996
. Dr Auer’s opinion is that Diclofenac
would not be present in the urine of a normal greyhound fed a normal diet and
likely cause of Diclofenac in the urine specimen from a greyhound is
from administration of Diclofenac to the greyhound or an ingestion
of Diclofenac
by the greyhound.
At the Steward’s inquiry Mrs Bernstone was
vehement in her denial of any administration of any drugs whatsoever to
Harry or any of her greyhounds. In her appeal Mrs Bernstone
submitted her feeding routine for her dogs in considerable detail and
any treatments by her dog are through herbal treatments and they are all drug
At the Appeal Mrs Bernstone continued her denial of any
administration of the dogs and this Authority has no reason to disbelieve
A breach of Rule under 106 is a strict liability rule and the issue is
the penalty imposed by the Stewards. Mrs Bernstone submits
that as she did not
administer the drug that should be taken into account and the 3 months
suspension and $500 fine is too harsh.
Mrs Bernstone’s personal
circumstances are that she has been involved in greyhounds for in excess of 25
years. She took up
her interest in greyhounds at the age of 38 after a severe
accident and that her interests are the racing of greyhounds and the breeding
greyhound pups. Mrs Bernstone has her granddaughter assisting her with the
dogs. Her granddaughter was handling the dog on 26
June 2002 and was present
with Mrs Bernstone at the appeal. She assists in the walking and handling of
the greyhounds as Mrs Bernstone
has difficulties in that regard because of the
past accident.
It is clear that Mrs Bernstone has a great love of
greyhounds and her objection to the penalty is coupled with the indignation of
being convicted of a drug offence under the rules of racing. This is the first
time that Mrs Bernstone has been before the Stewards.
At the appeal there
was handed to the Authority by Mr Ryan details of penalties in drug matters and
Mr Ryan correctly pointed out
to the Authority the two previous fines imposed by
the Stewards concerning the drug Diclofenac were $500 fines. Both of those
were in July 1999 and Mr Ryan explained that the circumstances concerned
wrong information being given to the trainers involved.
Generally a
suspension of 3 months and a fine of $500 in this type of matter would be
considered proper and not disturbed by the Authority.
As is often mentioned by
this Authority there is a need that the industry be free of drugs and it is only
on rare occasions that
any penalty under
should not have a
disqualification or a suspension. This is not one of those
The Authority, however, feels that in all the circumstances
that one month’s suspension would have been more appropriate with
fine and the Authority reduces the suspension to a period of one month and the
$500 fine is to remain.
