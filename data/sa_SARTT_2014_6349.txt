RESIDENTIAL TENANCY AGREEMENT DETAILS
18 Alcatraz Street Aberfoyle Park SA 5159
Paul Sollitto
William Hynes
Tenancy Commenced:
26 July 2014
Term of Tenancy:
Twelve months
$300.00 per week, payable fortnightly
Security Bond
Sworn or affirmed evidence was given by
Landlord Paul Sollitto
The tenant and anyone who lives at the premises were given notice of the
hearing. The tenant did not attend the hearing.
I attempted contacting the tenant at the commencement of the hearing but was
unsuccessful in reaching him.
A notice of termination (Form 2) dated 27 September 2014 was served on the
tenant because of rent arrears. The notice of termination
is valid. The tenant
did not pay the overdue rent by the due date. This terminated the tenancy.
I note this tenancy commenced on 26 July 2014. However, no rent was paid
whatsoever until 11 October 2014. According to the landlord,
the tenant has
paid a total of $700 to date. Further the landlord did not collect any security
bond. As such, according to the landlord’s
records, rent is now paid to 9
August 2014 with $100.00 in credit. Therefore rent arrears currently stand at
I have considered all the evidence and have decided the tenant must move out
of the premises on Wednesday 3 December 2014.
However, in regard to the rent arrears owed by the tenant, I am mindful that
the landlord has not mitigated his loss of rent. The
duty of mitigation is
detailed in
Residential Tenancies Act 1995
The landlord allowed the tenant to move into the rental premises with no
payment of bond or rent. The tenant lived in the premises
for about 2 months
before paying $700.00. The landlord could have made an application to the
Tribunal for a vacant possession order
in August 2014 but did not do so until 5
November 2014.
At the hearing I asked the landlord his reasons for allowing the tenant to
take possession of the premises without paying rent or
bond and why he had
allowed such a time to lapse before applying for a vacant possession order with
the Tribunal. He responded by
stating that he had believed the tenant would pay
and that the tenant had told him he would apply to the South Australian Housing
Trust for assistance.
Whilst I accept the landlord’s submissions concerning why he did not
pursue the rent arrears and bond payment earlier, I also
note that the Act
provides a quick and simple mechanism for dealing with rent arrears.
Taking into account all of the evidence I have decided to allow $3,600.00 for
this claim rather than the rent arrears sought by the
landlord, being $4,871.43
to Wednesday 3 December 2014.
tenant must move out of the premises by 11.00am on Wednesday 3 December 2014 but
if the tenant does not move out this order may
only be enforced by the Tribunal
tenant must pay to the landlord $3,600.00 within 14 days of the date of this
order: if the tenant does not pay, this order may
be enforced in the Magistrates

Important information for the landlord
If the tenant does not move out of the premises by the time stated you may
request that the Tribunal bailiff evict the tenant and
any other occupants of
the premises by faxing or delivering a signed letter to the Tribunal Registry
marked for the attention of
the Registrar stating that the tenant has not moved
out of the premises.
