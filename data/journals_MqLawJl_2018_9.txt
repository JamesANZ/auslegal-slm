III LITIGATION HISTORY
Katsis was found guilty of murder and sexual intercourse without consent on
21 October 2015. He was sentenced by Fagan J in the Supreme
Court of NSW on 11
December 2015 to 26 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15
years. Justice Fagan described the
attack on a ‘vulnerable, inoffensive,
lonely old lady’ as ‘savage, inhuman and
despicable’.
having clearly considered the vulnerability of the victim to be a relevant
factor, Fagan J did not refer to s 21A (2)(l)
Crimes (Sentencing
Procedure) Act
in his sentencing judgment. Also taken into account was
evidence of physical and sexual abuse to the offender in his early years,
substance abuse issues, the absence of contrition or remorse and the sentences
imposed in comparable cases of murder at the time
of the 1988
On 1 November 2017, the applicant sought leave to appeal the sentences on
five separate grounds. The only relevant ground to this
discussion is the first,
in which Katsis argued that the sentencing judge had erred in taking into
account the victim’s vulnerability
as an aggravating factor. The
additional grounds of appeal involved the application of principles for
sentencing historical offences,
the downward adjustment of the ratio set out in
failure to assess the
moral culpability of the applicant as a result of his deprived upbringing and
failure to take into account
the applicant’s otherwise good
These grounds of
appeal fall outside the scope of this discussion given its focus on the
recognition of vulnerability in sentencing
elder abuse cases. The Court gave
leave to appeal, and made a decision on 14 February

V CRITIQUE AND COMMENTARY
Evidence of Recognition and Progression
This decision appears to contribute towards the growing recognition of elder
abuse as an imperative issue in Australian society. The
2017 ALRC Report into
elder abuse suggested that ‘older people should not be considered
vulnerable merely because of their
‘vulnerability does not only extend from intrinsic factors such as health,
but also from social or structural factors, like
isolation and community
attitudes’.
Similarly, the
decision in
Katsis v The
attempts to separate
the vulnerability of certain older people from their age in years or the
presence of a disability,
instead place them into a wider context in which older members of society are
often ostracised or mistreated. The decision in
Katsis v The
alongside the 2017
ALRC Report into elder abuse,
has the potential to ensure that any form of abuse towards or neglect of an
older person is condemned in an appropriate manner through
harsher sentencing
penalties. The decision may also assist in identifying classes of older people
who are susceptible to mistreatment
in situations in which they may not have
traditionally been considered to be vulnerable, such as financial manipulation
in the planning
of wills, superannuation and family
agreements.
The decision in
Katsis v The
also appears to
fall into a general progression in judicial and legislative thinking towards
stricter sentencing principles for crimes
committed against vulnerable victims.
The original provision in the
Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act
that dealt with
the judicial power to increase or decrease penalties had no reference to
vulnerable victims and provided no specific
guidance in regard to this matter.
In fact, no guidance was provided at all to judges in relation to the types of
matters that should
be seen as aggravating or mitigating an
This provision was
modified in 2002 to include the consideration of ‘any vulnerability of the
victim arising because of the
nature of the victim’s
occupation’,
but did not
cover any other areas of vulnerability. In 2003, the provision was again changed
to include the vast majority of the
examples that are now a part of the
When analysing the development in judicial thought surrounding

that the courts have progressively worked towards viewing the examples included

Limitations
Despite the significance of the
in recognising the
seriousness of elder abuse, it could be somewhat limited in its applicability.
One of the most significant areas
of elder abuse highlighted in the 2017 ALRC
report was institutional elder abuse occurring in aged care
facilities.
The decision in
Katsis v The Queen
would likely not affect the consideration of sentencing principles for
crimes committed in these institutions, or in many care relationships,
individuals would likely be considered ‘very old’, or would be
suffering from a cognitive or physical
disability.
Thus, the decision
Katsis v The Queen
would only affect cases of elder abuse that have occurred to individuals outside
the scope of the examples provided in

‘classes’ of vulnerable people outside of the very
specific class of
victim in this case, that is, an elderly woman who ‘lives alone, does not
associate with other persons, has
no community support and does not look after
Thus, it is
unclear as to how this
would apply to
future cases in which, for reasons not analogous to the victim in
an elderly person
could be considered vulnerable. Finally, the longevity and significance of the
decision remains uncertain, as it
could be appealed or reversed by the High
Court in similar circumstances.
VI CONCLUSION
Despite being prima facie limited in its applicability, the decision in
Katsis v The Queen
is indicative of a broader shift in the fabric of Australia’s social,
political and judicial thinking surrounding the abuse
of older people in our
society. Further, it has the potential to increase the sentences imposed on
offenders who mistreat those who,
through a variety of interdependent factors,
are victims of what we now understand to be elder abuse. In order to determine
the significance
Katsis v The
in relation to
s 21A(2)(l)
the progression of
this area of law will need to be continually monitored as the recognition of
elder abuse becomes further entrenched
within Australian society.
