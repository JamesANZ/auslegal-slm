REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT
Mr Leo Williams AO Chairman
Mr Brock Miller – Deputy Chairman
Dennis Standfield – Member
This is an application by the Metropolitan Harness Racing Club Rocklea Inc
(Rocklea Club) in two parts:
an extension of time for the lodgement of an appeal against a decision of
Harness Racing Queensland Limited (HRQ) pursuant to
Section 168(4) of the
Racing Act 2002
application for a stay of proceedings under Section 170 of the
in relation to “a decision” by the HRQ not to extend the licence of
Rocklea Club to continue to conduct racing at Rocklea
beyond 31 July
The material before the Tribunal was largely confined to an
affidavit of Mr Michael Godber, the Chief Executive Officer of HRQ. Appended
that affidavit was an exchange of correspondence setting out a recent history of
dealings between the parties. A decision was
made on 9 June that HRQ determined
not to license Rocklea Club to race at Rocklea beyond 31 July next.
It appears that this was communicated around 23 June but it certainly had
been in the contemplation of the parties for some time before
that. Contained in
the material inter alia is a letter from Woods Prince Lawyers dated 12 March
2009 indicating that HRQ had advised
Rocklea Club that it was to cease
operations at the end of the financial year i.e. 30 June 2008.The only relevance
of this letter
to the present applications is the fact that at that time Rocklea
Club had access to legal advice. When canvassing the exchange of
correspondence,
it appears the parties agreed that the licence would extend at least until 31
In any event the decision was made in early June that the licence would not
be renewed and was communicated to Rocklea Club at the
end of June.
The only reason advanced in the appellant’s material for supporting the
application for extension of time was that HRQ did not
notify Rocklea Club of
its rights to appeal the decision of HRQ Mr Murdoch SC put a series of other
submissions about solvency and
implied or agreed rights of renewal to support
his clients application but there was little in the material available to
the application
There was also an argument by Mr Murdoch SC that HRQ
should have taken advantage of the show cause/cancellation procedures contained
in the Act but agauin these don not cover the situation as disclosed to the
Mr Peter Callaghan SC Counsel for HRQ argued in respect of both issues that
Rocklea Club needed to establish that it had
(a) a case on appeal with reasonable prospects of success
(b) that Rocklea Club would be severely disadvantaged if a stay was not
(c) that there would be a disadvantage to HRQ which outweighed the
disadvantage suffered by Rocklea Club if a stay were not granted.
He cited the case of
Asia Pacific International Pty Ltd –v- Peel
Valley Mushrooms and Anor
[1998] QCA 414
[1999] 2 Qdr 458
as the authority for this
proposition.
While the Tribunal is prepared to accept that there will be disadvantage to
Rocklea Club were a stay not granted, there is equal evidence
available that if
a stay were granted HRQ will be subjected to significant financial disadvantage
in its obligation to continue to
fund Rocklea Club to conduct its activities
beyond 31 July.
A major stumbling block for Rocklea Club appears to be whether it has
aprospectively successful or weven arguable case on appeal.
In the time
available Mr Murdoch SC was not able to adduce evidence to support Rocklea
Club’s case. The bulk of the evidence
before the Tribunal was submitted in
the affidavit of Mr Godber the CEO of HRQ. There were audited financial reports
for the year
ended 30 June 2008, a business plan, an exchange of correspondence
relating to the business plan and an analysis by HRQ of the projections
which Rocklea Club based its forecasts. All of This pointed to a parlous
financial position calling into question the ability
of Rocklea Club to meet
its debts as and when they fall due especially without the direct and
significant support of HRQ who say
such will not be forthcoming.
Mr Murdoch SC was insistent that Rocklea Club’s trading position and
cash position was sound but it is hard to accept that on
what was available to
the Tribunal. Many of the assertions that would support that proposition are in
the form of optimistic assessments
of increased fees and increased turnover, not
justified when compared to any historical analysis.
A major difficulty the Tribunal has in coming to grips with the application
is what decision it is that the Tribunal must stay. Rocklea
Club’s licence
has been renewed annually for 50 years but as of July 2009 it has not been
renewed and expires on 31 July 2009.
It seems that the Tribunal is being asked
to deal with a situation in which there is a refusal to renew a licence. On the
before the Tribunal, it can only conclude that HRQ were within its
rights and were justified in reaching conclusions they have to
support the
decision not to renew.
On that basis alone, the Tribunal considers that Rocklea Club has not made
out sufficient grounds to conclude that it has any reasonable
prospects of a
success on an appeal against any decision or refusal to make a decision or
deemed refusal to renew the licence.
As to the question of an extension of
time for the bringing of the appeal beyond the 14 days allowed by the
legislation the applicant
has not shown any real basis for the tribunal to grant
such. Rocklea had access to legal advice as mentioned above and there appears
be no basis upon which this Tribunal should exercise its discretion in favour of
the applicant .
The relief sought in the application is therefore denied,
both as to an extension of time and a stay of the decision of HRQ.
