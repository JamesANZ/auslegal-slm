This instrument is the
Fuel Quality Standards
(Biodiesel) Determination 2019
2 Commencement
This instrument commences on 1 October 2019.
3 Authority
This instrument is made under
Fuel Quality Standards
4 Definitions
Note: A number of expressions used in this instrument are defined in
of the Act, including the following:
In this instrument:
Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000
followed by an alphanumeric code means the testing method
developed under that code by the standards development organisation called
International.
means a diesel fuel obtained by esterification of oil
derived from plants or animals.
has the same meaning as in the
Fuel Quality Standards
(Automotive Diesel) Determination 2019.
followed by a numeric code means the testing method
developed under that code by the European Committee for Standardization.
means milligrams per kilogram, and is equivalent to
‘parts per million’ or ‘ppm’ by mass.
means per cent volume by volume, and is equivalent to
‘volume %’, ‘vol %’ and ‘% vol’.
means per cent mass by mass, and is equivalent to
‘mass %’, ‘% mass’ and ‘weight %’.

(2) For subsection (1), compliance with the specification for a parameter is
determined by using the testing method for that parameter
mentioned in that item
of the table.
Note: The testing methods listed in the table are the methods that will be
used by inspectors and other persons authorised to conduct
tests on fuel under
the Act to determine whether the fuel complies with the relevant fuel standard.
Subsection (2) does not prevent
other persons (including persons supplying fuel)
from using other test methods to ensure that the fuel complies with the relevant
fuel standard.
