INTRODUCTION
1 On 25 October 2013, [Ms Dean] commenced financial
proceedings against her former husband [Mr Dean]. On 11 June 2014, Ms Dean
her application, including by naming as additional respondents to the
proceedings, Mr Dean’s parents, [G & P Dean], together
company, [CDM Pty Ltd] (together referred to as the “second, third and
fourth respondents”). Since this time,
the second, third and fourth
respondents have sought, unsuccessfully, that Ms Dean specify with precision the
nature of her claim
against them.
2 The applications currently before the court are:
Form 2 Application by the second, third and fourth respondents filed 17 November
2016 in summary, that:
to Ms Dean’s non-compliance with a self-executing order made by his Honour
Justice Walters on 5 July 2016 (“the
July 2016 orders”), Ms
Dean’s application in so far as it relates to the second, third and fourth
respondents be deemed
dismissed effective as of 10 August 2016;
Alternatively,
as a result of Ms Dean’s ongoing non-compliance with other paragraphs of
the July 2016 orders, her application
in so far as it relates to the second,
third and fourth respondents be dismissed.
Form 2 Application by Mr Dean filed 17 November 2016 that he have leave to
proceed on an undefended basis and that Ms Dean be
prohibited from filing any
further court documents or participating in the proceedings in any way unless
with the leave of the court.
WHAT IS THE BACKGROUND TO THESE PROCEEDINGS?
3 From the late 1970s or early 1980s, G & P Dean
operated a farming business known as [Farm A] on farm land owned by their
CDM Pty Ltd (“the Farm Land”). They lived in the main
in about 1989
and were married [in] 1990. After their marriage, Mr Dean and Ms Dean
moved into a cottage on the farm and commenced
full-time work on the farm.
4 In late 1997, Mr Dean established a family trust known as [Farm A Trust],
the trustee of which was [Farm A Pty Ltd]. Mr Dean was
the appointor of the
trust. Subsequently, Mr Dean (through his trust) and his two brothers [P] and
[J] (through their respective
entities) became partners with G & P Dean in
the partnership of [the Dean Partnership]. Thereafter the partnership operated
a number of business enterprises, including:
[farming] business known as Farm A, on part of the Farm Land. This business was
operated by Mr Dean.
separate [farming] business known as [Farm B], on a separate part of the Farm
Land. This business was operated by P.
separate business known as [Farm C]. This business was operated by J.
5 In or about 1998, G & P Dean moved out of the main homestead
on Farm A and Mr Dean and Ms Dean then moved in. Mr Dean and
Ms Dean continued
to live and work on the property until November 2012, when they separated on a
final basis and Ms Dean left the
6 Ms Dean commenced the financial proceedings on 25 October 2013. In
support of her application, Ms Dean filed a lengthy and detailed
setting out her understanding of the parties’ financial position. At the
time, she was represented by [Law Firm
A]. Ms Dean did not specify the final
orders that she sought against Mr Dean, instead proposing that she particularise
orders she sought within 42 days of receiving full and frank
disclosure from Mr Dean. At the first return date on 10 December 2013,
court made an order that Ms Dean and Mr Dean file and serve any amended
application or response setting out and particularising
the final orders sought;
and in the event any third party was to be joined, then they also be given
notice. Ms Dean failed to file
an amended application within the timeframe.
The court granted extensions of time for her to file an amended application on
2014 and again on 5 May 2014.
7 On 11 June 2014, Ms Dean filed an amended Form 1 Application, naming the
second, third and fourth respondents as parties. At the
time, Ms Dean was
represented by [Law Firm B]. In summary she sought orders that Mr Dean
transferred to her a proportion of the
Farm Land and in the event he did not
have an interest in the Farm Land, then the second, third and fourth respondents
transfer such
proportion of the Farm Land or pay her such amount as the court
deemed appropriate. Ms Dean did not otherwise specify the orders
sought by her
against the second, third and fourth respondents. She also did not file and
serve any other document setting out the
legal and factual basis for her claim
against the second, third and fourth respondents.
8 On 9 September 2014, the second, third and fourth respondents filed a Form
1A Response, seeking that Ms Dean’s application
in so far as it related to
them be dismissed. They also sought a number of interim orders, in effect
seeking that Ms Dean be required
to particularise her claim against them. The
matter was dealt with by her Honour Justice Crisford on 18 November 2014. Her
made an order that within 21 days, Ms Dean file and serve the following
Minute specifying with particularity the orders sought by Ms Dean against the
second, third and fourth respondents, and identify
the relevant provisions under
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth) (“the Act”) relied upon by her
in support of the orders
she sought;
affidavit setting out the evidence upon which Ms Dean asserted the orders sought
by her against the second, third and fourth respondents
document (in the nature of a statement of claim) setting out the legal and
factual basis under which Ms Dean relied to seek orders
in the terms of her
amended Form 1 Application.
9 Ms Dean filed and served a
statement of claim and a minute of orders sought on 9 December 2014. Ms Dean
also filed a lengthy and
detailed affidavit at the same time, which not only set
out her evidence in relation to her claim against the second, third and fourth
respondents, but also set out detailed evidence in relation to her claim against
At the time, Ms Dean continued to be represented by Law Firm
B. In her statement of claim, Ms Dean sought orders that the parties
effect and implement an alleged agreement recorded in a Memorandum of
Understanding dated 12 November 2010 and a supplementary
document dated 30
November 2010; and alternatively, that the second, third and fourth respondents
do transfer to Mr Dean and Ms Dean
10,500 acres of the Farm Land or such sum as
represented the value of that land. In my view, on their face, the documents
appear to record any agreement and instead set out various options
and/or negotiating positions, including for separating out from
the partnership,
the three businesses operated by Mr Dean and his two brothers.
10 Throughout much of 2015, the parties were engaged in various disputes
concerning disclosure and the issuing of subpoenas to produce
documents. During
this time, Ms Dean was represented by [Law Firm C] and then by [Law Firm D]. On
30 September 2015, her Honour
Justice Crisford made an order by consent that
within 30 days Ms Dean file and serve an amended statement of claim (“the
2015 order”). Ms Dean did not comply with the September 2015
order and in November 2015, Law Firm D ceased acting on Ms Dean’s
11 On 7 January 2016, the second, third and fourth respondents filed a Form
2 Application seeking that Ms Dean’s application
against them be dismissed
as she had failed to comply with the September 2015 order. Her Honour Justice
Crisford dealt with the
application on 11 January 2016. Ms Dean attended the
hearing in person and was unrepresented. Her Honour made an order that the
for Ms Dean to comply with the September 2015 order be extended to the close of
business on 11 March 2016. The transcript of
the proceedings revealed that
during the hearing, counsel for the second, third and fourth respondents sought
a “guillotine”
or self-executing order in relation to the filing of
the amended statement of claim.
Her Honour refused counsel’s
application, however made the following observation to Ms Dean:
I have considerable sympathy for their position. I’m not going to make a
self-executing order. What I’m going to do
is to ensure that the
adjourned hearing is very close to the time limit that I intend to give and I
would have thought given the
history of the matter that this really is the last
opportunity for you to do that. Otherwise, the second, third and fourth
respondents
will not be a party to these proceedings and you’re going to
have considerable difficulties in running the case that you’re
trying to put to the court. So I’m being urged to make an order that cuts
you out immediately. I’m giving
you one last
opportunity.
12 On 11 March 2016, Ms Dean filed an
amended statement of claim. At this time, Ms Dean was represented by [Law Firm
amended statement of claim, Ms Dean abandoned her claims that the
parties give effect to the alleged agreement recorded in the Memorandum
Understanding and supplementary document; or alternatively, that the second,
third and fourth respondents do transfer to Mr Dean
and Ms Dean 10,500 acres of
the Farm Land or such sum as represented the value of that land. Instead, Ms
Dean claimed, amongst other
things, that the parties and others were engaged in
a joint endeavour and sought that an account be taken of the value of her and
Dean’s contributions to the joint endeavour (“the Accounted
13 On 18 March 2016, his Honour Justice Walters made an order that by 18
April 2016 the second, third and fourth respondents file
and serve a document in
the nature of a defence to Ms Dean’s amended statement of claim, together
with a supporting affidavit.
The second, third and fourth respondents did not
file their defence within time, but did so on 1 June 2016.
14 The matter came before his Honour Justice Walters again on
5 July 2016. At this time Ms Dean was represented by [Law Firm F].
The July 2016 orders made by his Honour were as follows:
35 days from the date of these orders, the applicant wife must file and serve
Particulars of her Statement of Claim in relation
to the second, third and
fourth respondents particularising the amount of the "Accounted Value" claimed

15 On 8 August 2016, Ms Dean
filed her particulars of statement of claim (“Particulars”). At the
time, Ms Dean continued
to be represented by Law Firm F. I accept the
submission of counsel for the second, third and fourth respondents that the
Particulars
did not comply with paragraph 1 of the July 2016 orders in that:
did not particularise the value or amount of the “Accounted Value”
of the alleged contributions set out at paragraphs
9 and 10 of the Particulars;
Notwithstanding
references in the Particulars to “methods of calculation”, it did
not in fact particularise how the “Accounted
Value” was calculated
for most items referred to. In my view, a number of the purported
“methods of calculation”
for the various contributions set out in
the Particulars did no more than make ambit or global claims by reference to the
total current
value of various assets, (for example the current values of real
estate, buildings, plant and equipment and ignoring the liabilities
in relation
16 At no time after 8 August 2016 did Ms Dean or her
solicitors seek leave to file amended Particulars, to remedy the defects in
document. On 31 August 2016 the solicitors for the second, third and fourth
respondents wrote to Law Firm F putting Ms Dean
on notice that they did not
concede that Ms Dean had complied with paragraph 1 of the July 2016 orders. Ms
Dean did not respond
to the letter, either personally or through her solicitors.
17 On 11 October 2016, the second, third and fourth respondents filed a
minute of proposed orders sought. In effect, they sought
that pursuant to
paragraph 2 of the July 2016 orders, Ms Dean’s application in so far as it
related to them be deemed to have
been dismissed. On 12 October 2016, Mr Dean
also filed a minute of final orders sought, which in effect proposed a 60/40
in Ms Dean’s favour of their net asset pool.
18 On 14 October 2016, Ms Dean filed a notice of address for service on her
own behalf. She has been self-represented since this
time. Thereafter, Ms Dean
filed her trial affidavit and financial statement purportedly in compliance with
the July 2016 orders.
She did not file and serve an undertaking as to
disclosure or a minute of final orders sought.
19 Ms Dean’s filed financial statement was incomplete. Ms
Dean’s trial affidavit was as follows

20 In my view, there are significant issues with Ms
Dean’s trial affidavit, including that she simply failed to set out any
evidence in relation to: (1) her claims against the second, third and fourth
respondents; (2) contribution factors pursuant to s
79 of the Act; and (3)
the various factors set out in s 75(2) of the Act. Ms Dean also purported
to annex to her affidavit approximately
100 pages of documents that included,
inter alia, excerpts from unidentified documents, newspaper articles, partial
invoices, unidentified
photographs, references from third parties and a school
reference for Mr Dean’s and Ms Dean’s son. In my view, much
affidavit is objectionable and likely to be the subject of a successful strike
out application, if made.
21 On 17 November 2016, Mr Dean and the second, third and fourth respondents
filed their respective Form 2 Applications, the subject
of these proceedings.
22 The parties attended a Readiness Hearing before Registrar Forrest on 23
November 2016. The transcript of the hearing revealed
that Mr Dean’s
counsel raised with the Registrar his concerns about the state of Ms
Dean’s evidence as contained in her
trial affidavit. Ms Dean confirmed to
the Registrar that aside from some disclosure documents that she was still
pursuing, all of
the evidence that she wished the trial judge to consider was
contained in her trial affidavit.
However, the transcript also revealed
that the Registrar did not draw to Ms Dean’s attention the significant
issues with her
trial affidavit, or invite Ms Dean to consider making an
application to rely at trial upon any of her earlier affidavits filed in
proceedings. The Registrar determined not to place the matter in the Callover
for the allocation of a trial date in due course.
Instead, she listed the Form
2 Applications for hearing on 13 December 2016.
23 On 1 December 2016, Ms Dean filed an affidavit purportedly for the
hearing on 13 December 2016. The affidavit was in the following

24 On 9 December
2016, Ms Dean filed a further affidavit, purportedly for the hearing on 13
December 2016. The affidavit was in
the following terms:

25 Again, Ms Dean
annexed a large bundle of documents to her affidavit, many of which appeared to
bear no relationship to the matters
raised by her in the affidavit.
26 In my view, Ms Dean’s two December 2016 affidavits were chaotic,
difficult to follow and appeared to have only limited relevance
to the issues
raised in the two Form 2 Applications. Although the state of Ms Dean’s
trial affidavit and her two December
2016 affidavits raised concerns in my mind
three years, Ms Dean has instructed six separate firms of lawyers, none of
whom raised any concerns with the court about Ms Dean’s
capacity to
conduct the proceedings. In addition, Ms Dean annexed to her 9 December 2016
affidavit a letter from [Dr D], her treating
general medical practitioner, dated
30 November 2016. Whilst Dr D raised issues about Ms Dean suffering from a
chest infection and
low iron levels in 2016, she did not raise any issues in
relation to Ms Dean’s capacity to conduct the proceedings.
27 At the hearing on 13 December 2016, Ms Dean continued to represent
herself. Again, Ms Dean’s submissions were chaotic,
difficult to follow
and appeared to have only limited relevance to the issues raised in the two Form
2 Applications. However, Ms
Dean did confirm that she opposed the orders sought
by Mr Dean and the second, third and fourth respondents. Accordingly, I
on the basis that Ms Dean in effect sought:
order that the court grant her a further extension of time in which to comply
with paragraph 1 of the July 2016 orders, notwithstanding
that it had already
order that the court grant her a further extension of time in which to comply
with paragraphs 7 and 8 of the July 2016 orders;
the two Form 2 Applications otherwise be dismissed.
SHOULD MS DEAN BE GRANTED AN EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE AMENDED
PARTICULARS NOTWITHSTANDING THE SELF-EXECUTING ORDER HAS ALREADY SPRUNG?
28 I proceed on the basis that the applicable
principles are as set out in the decision of her Honour Justice Crisford in
[2014] FCWA 50
29 I am satisfied that since late 2014, the second, third and fourth
respondents have attempted to have Ms Dean particularise the
legal and factual
basis for her claim against them. After Ms Dean failed to comply with the
September 2015 order, her Honour Justice
Crisford declined to make a
self-executing order against Ms Dean on 11 January 2016. However, her Honour
made it clear to Ms Dean
that she was being given one last opportunity to get
her house in order. Ms Dean did not do so. Although Ms Dean filed an amended
statement of claim in March 2016, the document still materially failed to
particularise her claim against the second, third and fourth
respondents. It
was against this background that on 5 July 2016, his Honour Justice Walters made
the self-executing order and additional
orders for the filing of trial
documents. Ms Dean had the benefit of legal representation for much of the
proceedings, including
in the preparation of her statement of claim, amended
statement of claim and Particulars. The July 2016 orders in effect marked
end of the line for Ms Dean to particularise her claim against the second, third
and fourth respondents, or proceed onto trial
on the basis that her claim
against them had been dismissed.
30 Ms Dean’s reasons for non-compliance with the self-executing order
were difficult to discern. However, during Ms Dean’s
oral submissions,
two main themes emerged. Firstly, Ms Dean maintained that she suffered from low
iron levels that caused her to
be tired and fatigued. The letter from Dr D
confirmed that Ms Dean was treated for a chest infection in May 2016 and was
with low iron levels in October 2016, for which she also received
treatment. Dr D confirmed in her letter that “over the time
these medical
problems would have impacted negatively on her ability to prepare and present
for any court proceedings”. However,
there was no specific evidence (and
Ms Dean did not assert) that she was unable to give instructions to her former
solicitors during
the relevant period in July and August 2016 due to ongoing
health issues. Secondly, Ms Dean complained that she was unable to particularise
her claim against the second, third and fourth respondents due to ongoing
disclosure issues. In particular, she maintained that
there had been
non-compliance with the disclosure orders made by the court on 21 March 2016.
However, the documents identified by
Ms Dean as being outstanding appeared to
have little if any relevance to her claim against the second, third and fourth
respondents.
Rather, they appeared to primarily relate to the Farm A farming
business operated by Mr Dean and Mr Dean’s personal financial
circumstances.
31 Ms Dean did not maintain and there was no evidence to suggest that the
non-compliance with paragraph 1 of the July 2016 was caused
by Ms Dean’s
former solicitors. Even if the default was caused by Ms Dean’s
solicitors, then this is not of itself sufficient
to enable Ms Dean to avoid the
consequences of the self-executing order.
At the end of the day, I am
not satisfied that Ms Dean provided a proper or sufficient explanation for her
failure to comply with
paragraph 1 of the July 2016 orders.
32 If I do not extend the time for compliance with the filing of the
Particulars, then Ms Dean will be unable to pursue her claim
against the second,
third and fourth respondents. Given Ms Dean’s ongoing failure to
particularise the legal and factual basis
for her claim against them, it is
difficult to assess the merits of her claim. Even if I were satisfied that Ms
Dean had a meritorious
case, it does not insulate her from her failure to comply
with paragraph 1 of the July 2016 orders.
If I extend the time for
compliance with the filing of the Particulars, then the second, third and fourth
respondents’ position
will be largely unchanged from that when the
self-executing order was made on 5 July 2016. They will continue to be in a
of not knowing the proper legal and factual basis of Ms Dean’s
claim against them.
33 In conclusion, I am not satisfied in the exercise of my discretion that
Ms Dean should be granted a further extension of time
to file amended
Particulars, particularly having regard to the lack of any proper or sufficient
explanation for her failure in this
regard. I am satisfied that Ms Dean should
bear the consequences of her failure to comply with paragraph 1 of the July 2016
34 Although the second, third and fourth respondents sought a further order
that pursuant to paragraph 2 of the July 2016 orders,
Ms Dean pay their costs
“on an indemnity basis”, I am not satisfied it is appropriate to do
so. Paragraph 2 of the July
2016 orders provided that Ms Dean pay “the
second, third and fourth respondents’ costs in these proceedings”.
The second, third and fourth respondents did not appeal this order. As the
particular order did not specify the method for the calculation
of the costs,
pursuant to
Family Law Rules
(“the Rules”), the
costs are to be assessed on a party / party basis.
SHOULD MR DEAN BE GRANTED LEAVE TO PROCEED UNDEFENDED?
35 I proceed on the basis that the relevant
principles are as set out in
Tate v Tate
[2000] FamCA 1040
(2000) FLC 93-047
36 Mr Dean maintained that having regard to: (1) the state of Ms
Dean’s trial affidavit and financial statement; and (2) her
file and serve an undertaking as to disclosure and minute; the court should make
orders to enable him to proceed on an
undefended basis. However, I am not
satisfied that it is appropriate to do so and intend to dismiss Mr Dean’s
application
for the following reasons:
trial directions as contained in the July 2016 orders were intended to enable
the parties to sensibly prepare for trial (including
by encouraging full and
frank disclosure, the identification of the matters genuinely in dispute and the
expeditious marshalling
and presentation of the relevant evidence).
Nevertheless, the principles of case management must remain subject to and never
over the attainment of justice overall.
Ms Dean failed to file documents in accordance with the trial directions as
contained in the July 2016 orders, and her trial
affidavit and financial
statement were clearly defective, I am not satisfied that Ms Dean did so
wilfully or deliberately. Ms Dean
was self-represented from October 2016,
including when: (1) she prepared and filed her trial affidavit and financial
statement; and
(2) when she attended the Readiness Hearing. In my view, it
appears that Ms Dean has struggled significantly to prepare her matter
in the absence of ongoing legal advice and assistance. In such circumstances, I
am not satisfied that it is appropriate
that Ms Dean should be penalised for not
having the benefit of ongoing legal advice and assistance in preparing for
trial. This
is particularly in circumstances where: (1) Ms Dean has, earlier in
the proceedings and with the benefit of legal assistance, filed
lengthy and
detailed affidavits setting out her evidence in relation to the financial
proceedings vis a vis Mr Dean; and (2) it is
open to Ms Dean to seek that the
trial judge or magistrate take these affidavits into account for the purposes of
is some (as yet untested) evidence to suggest that Mr Dean did not come before
the court with entirely clean hands himself.
In particular, Ms Dean maintained that Mr Dean has continually failed to comply
with orders to give full and proper disclosure of
relevant financial documents,
including but not limited to most recently: (1) up-to-date statements for the
Farm A farm cheque account;
(2) documents evidencing the purchase of a new
property in Perth; and (3) the Farmanco budgets.
SHOULD MS DEAN BE GRANTED AN EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE HER
UNDERTAKING AS TO DISCLOSURE AND HER MINUTE OF FINAL ORDERS SOUGHT?
37 Having regard to my earlier findings, I am
satisfied that Ms Dean should be granted a further extension of time to file her
undertaking
as to disclosure and her minute of final orders sought.
PROPOSED ORDERS:
38 I intend to refer the matter back to the
managing judge to make further orders, including for the inclusion of the matter
next available Callover, if appropriate.
39 I intend to make the following orders:
to paragraph 1(b) of the orders made on 5 July 2016, the applicant’s
application insofar as it relates to the second,
third and fourth respondents be
deemed dismissed, effective as of
10 August 2016.
time for the applicant to comply with paragraphs 7 and 8 of the orders made on 5
July 2016 be extended to the close of Registry
on 16 February 2017.
Form 2 Application filed by the first respondent on
17 November 2016,
together with the Form 2 Application filed by the second, third and fourth
respondents on 17 November 2016, otherwise
be dismissed.
proceedings otherwise be adjourned for monitoring before His Honour Justice
Walters on 23 February 2017 at 10am.
I certify that the preceding [39] paragraphs are a true copy
of the reasons for
judgment delivered by this Honourable
4 January 2017
______________________________________
It appears that Ms Dean swore and filed two versions of the
same affidavit – on 8 December 2014 and 9 January 2015.
Whilst Mr Dean and the second, third and fourth respondents agreed that the two
documents were prepared for the purposes of facilitating
discussions between G
& P Dean and their three sons, all denied that any agreement was reached in
the terms of any of the options
raised in the documents, or at all.
