REMARKS ON ADJOURNMENT
applicant employer lodged an application dated 23 December 2014 seeking a review
pursuant to section 72M of the
Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act
(“the Act”) of a decision made by the WorkCover Corporation
of South Australia (“the Corporation”) in relation
to a statutory
payment claimed by the Corporation, which the employer denies.
that time, the name of the Corporation has changed to the Return to Work
Corporation of South Australia: see
new Act”), Schedule 9 of which amended the former
WorkCover Corporation
to that effect (clause 11) and changed the name of the 1994 Act to
(clause 9 of
the same Schedule). These provisions commenced operation on 2 February 2015: see
December 2014, p.6610), clause 2(3)(zc). The remainder of the new Act commenced
operation on 1 July 2015.
Corporation has the option of continuing to act under the old name or adopting
the new name in any proceedings: see
Arrangements) (Administration) Regulations 2015
regulation 4.
Corporation has made it known it prefers henceforth to be known as the Return to
Work Corporation of South Australia (or RTWSA)
for all purposes, and I title
these proceedings accordingly.
the same time, and through the same proclamation (clause 2(3)(za) thereof),
section 157 of the 2014 Act was brought into operation,
providing for reviews of
premium decisions in almost identical terms to section 72M of the 1986 Act. The
two provisions, of course,
apply to the review of decisions made under the
respective legislative régimes and are in no way in conflict with one
Since 1 July 2015, there is also a new
Panel Determination 2015
, 2 July 2015, p.3369), but apart
from the change to the Panel’s name, that Determination is not relevant to
these proceedings,
as it directs (clause 40) that applications for review lodged
before that date are to be dealt with under the revoked
WorkCover Premium
Review Panel Determination 2014
, 10 July 2014, p.3200). The
present application appears to fall entirely under the 1986 Act, although no
doubt the issue it presents
will affect all subsequent premium years.
issue, as I understood it from the application, and Ms Budimski has confirmed my
understanding, is whether or not the company’s
workforce (if I may use
that word in a neutral way) comprises workers employed under contracts of
service within the meaning of the
Act, in respect of whom an obligation exists
to make statutory payments (in the nature of premiums) under the Act.
definition of
under section 3(1) of the 1986 Act
(a) a person by whom work is done under a contract of service (whether or
not as an employee);
(b) a person who is a worker by virtue of
section 103A
(c) a self-employed worker,
and includes a former worker and the legal personal representative of a
deceased worker ...
self-employed worker
is a reference to section 103 of the Act,
which provides for the Corporation to extend its protection to persons in that
on application and, to the best of my knowledge, has never been
activated. It may be safely assumed that neither that section nor
section 103A
is relevant (but I will hear from the parties further if that assumption is
contested). The definition of
contract of service
also appears in section
contract of service
(a) a contract under which one person (the worker) is employed by another
(the employer);
(b) a contract,
arrangement or understanding under which one person (the worker) works for
another in prescribed work or work of
a prescribed class;
(c) a contract of apprenticeship;
(d) a contract, arrangement or understanding under which a person (the
(i) receives on-the-job training in a trade or vocation from another (the
employer); and
(ii) is during the period of that training remunerated by the employer
seems to be no suggestion that either paragraph (c) or (d) of that definition is
relevant to this matter. Paragraph (a) refers
broadly to the common law test of
a contract of service, or contract of employment, as exemplified in such cases

(b) of the definition of
contract of service
refers to prescribed work or
work of a prescribed class. Regulations prescribing particular kinds of work
have been in existence
with little change since the earliest days of the
WorkCover scheme, and now find their embodiment in
regulation 5
Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Regulations 2010
particularly draw attention of the parties to these proceedings to
regulation 5
which relevantly prescribes
cleaning work
in the following
of service and other terms
(1) For the purposes of
the definition of
contract of service
in section 3(1) of the
Act (but subject to this regulation and
regulation 6
following classes of work under a contract, arrangement or understanding are
prescribed classes of work:
(b) cleaning work, where—
(i) the work is performed by 1 person to the contract, arrangement or
understanding (the
) in the course of or for the purposes of
a trade or business carried on by another person to the contract, arrangement or
understanding
(ii) the work is performed personally by the worker (whether or not the
worker supplies any tools, plant or equipment); and
(iii) the worker does not employ any other person to carry out any part of
the work; and
(A) in the case of window cleaning work—the value of any materials
supplied, or reasonably expected to be supplied, by the
worker does not
• if the term of the contract, arrangement or understanding is not
more than 1 month—$25;
• if the term of the contract, arrangement or understanding is more
than 1 month—an average of $25 per month;
(B) in any other case—the value of any materials supplied, or
reasonably expected to be supplied, by the worker does not exceed—
• if the term of the contract, arrangement or understanding is not
more than 1 month—$50;
• if the term of the contract, arrangement or understanding is more
than 1 month—an average of $50 per month;
(2) For the purposes of
subregulation (1)
(a) the value of any tool, plant or equipment owned or leased by a worker is
the price that, at the time that the worker enters into
the relevant contract,
arrangement or understanding, the worker would reasonably be expected to pay if
the worker were to purchase
an equivalent, unused, tool or item of plant or
equipment; and
(b) a vehicle will not be taken to be used for work purposes if its sole or
principal use is to transport the worker, and any tools,
plant or equipment, to
any work site.
(8) In this regulation—
cleaning work
means the work of cleaning any building or a part
of a building (including the windows of a building or the surrounds of a
window cleaning work
means the work of cleaning any window of a
building or a part of a building.
completeness, I observe that the definitions of
contract of

regulation 5

identical to the provisions of the 1986 Act and its regulations that I have set

called upon to consider whether various groups
of people were properly
identified by the Corporation as workers under contracts of service. These

Each is, of course, a case in which a single worker sought to establish
entitlements as a worker under the Act, but they show the
ways in which the
Tribunal, and the parties appearing before it, approach the issues presented by
the regulation.
the present case, I have seen none of the evidence, merely the application for
review and the Corporation’s reconsideration
document. Nothing can be
assumed. However, it seems to me that the questions that need to be addressed in
relation to the regulation
may include:
Whether the work
performed by the applicant’s workforce is appropriately characterised as
cleaning work
window cleaning work
within the meaning of
the regulation;
Whether the work
performed by the individual person is performed in the course of or for the
purposes of the business carried on by
the applicant;
Whether the work
is performed personally by the individuals (whether or not they supply any
tools, plant or equipment);
Whether the
individuals employ any other person to carry out any part of the work, or have
the right to do so;
In the case of
window cleaning, whether the value of materials supplied or reasonably expected
to be supplied by any individual exceeds
$25 per month on average;
In the case of
anything other than window cleaning, whether the value of materials supplied or
reasonably expected to be supplied
by any individual exceeds $50 per month on
the work is not appropriately characterised as cleaning work or window cleaning
work and thus falls outside the ambit of the regulation,

indicia described in

the end of the directions hearing today, Ms Budimski indicated that on the next
occasion the employer will be represented by a
solicitor, Mr M.F. Lindblom. I
would not wish to unduly direct or limit his researches. I direct a copy of
these remarks be sent
to him as well as the parties present today.
