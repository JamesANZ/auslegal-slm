REASONS FOR DECISION
is an application for legal representation made by Roofley Pty Ltd as trustee
for Woolnough Western Trust (“the applicant”)
who has filed an
application under the
Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003
order to terminate its site agreement with Mr Patten (“the
respondent”), who owns a manufactured home positioned
on site 96 in
Caboolture Caravan Park which is owned by the applicant.
respondent opposes the granting of leave for legal representation to the
applicant on the grounds that he cannot afford legal
representation and the
director of the respondent, Mr Woolnough, is capable of conducting the
proceedings.
applicant submits that although it cannot comment on the respondent’s
financial circumstances, there is clear evidence that
the respondent owns a
property near Howard, a residence at 227 Kings St, Caboolture and the
manufactured home which is the subject
of this dispute. In addition the
respondent owns a modern motor vehicle and trailer and is employed as a baker.
The applicant further
submits that while the facts in the matter are not complex
the legal issues require careful consideration and have significant
ramification.
It is submitted that the applicant is able to be represented by
its manager, Mr Baird, however Mr Baird will take advice from his
lawyers and
will follow their instruction and advice at the hearing. This has the potential
of slowing the hearing down as opposed
to allowing legal representation.
relevant provisions of the
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act 2003
(“the CCT Act”) are sections 73 and 76 which provide:-
"73 Purposes of div 8
The main purpose of this division is to have parties represent themselves
and save legal costs unless the interests of justice require
represents party at other proceedings
(1) Subject to the provisions of an empowering Act or
subsection (2) or (3), in a proceeding—
(a) a party, other than an individual, appearing before the tribunal may be
represented only by a person who is not a lawyer; and
(b) an individual appearing before the tribunal must represent himself or
(2) A party may be represented by a lawyer if—
(a) the proceeding relates to an application under the
Queensland Building
Services Authority Act 1991
(b) the proceeding is a disciplinary proceeding; or
(c) the proceeding is a public examination; or
(d) all parties to the proceeding agree; or
(e) the tribunal directs that representation by the lawyer is appropriate
having regard to all the circumstances including, for example—
(i) the cost
of representation and whether each party can afford to be represented;
complexity of the legal and factual issues involved; and
potential for lengthening the proceeding if a party is not represented;
ability of the lawyer or other person to help the tribunal and the party
represented; and
ability of the party to represent himself or herself.
(3) An individual appearing before the tribunal
may be represented by a person who is not a lawyer if the tribunal directs that
representation
by the person is appropriate having regard to all the
circumstances.”
considering the issue of legal representation it is necessary to have regard to
each of the factors listed above in section 76(2)(e)
of the CCT Act. With
respect to the respondent’s capacity to afford legal representation, the
Tribunal notes that he has some
assets and is in full-time employment as a
baker, but considers that the cost of legal representation is likely to be
means and would cause him financial hardship. The Tribunal does not
accept that the proceedings are factually or legal complex.
The single issue to
be determined is whether the manufactured home on site 96 is the
respondent’s principal place of residence
and, if not, whether the
Tribunal should in all the circumstances exercise its discretion to terminate
the site agreement. This
involves legal issues but they are not complex issues
and whoever represents the applicant will be able to avail himself of legal
advice. Mr Patten relies only on two short statements, but as credibility
issues arise, he will need to be cross-examined. The
Tribunal considers however
that Mr Baird would be capable of conducting such questioning reasonably well,
again with the assistance
of the legal advice which is available to him. The
Tribunal does not consider that legal representation of the applicant would
the proceedings to any significant degree.
regard to all the circumstances the Tribunal does not consider that legal
representation of the applicant is appropriate and
the application for legal
representation will be dismissed.
