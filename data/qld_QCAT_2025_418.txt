January 2024, a Queensland Building and Construction Commission
(“QBCC”) building inspector, Mr Colin Rendall
inspected the property
at 13 Lynd Road, Maclean at the request of Ms Courtney Bolton. A report dated
19 January 2024 (“the
QBCC 13 Lynd Road report”) was provided by Mr
Rendall outlining the item of complaint being the alleged defective work.
August 2024, Mr Rendall inspected the property at 15 Lynd Road, Maclean at the
request of Ms Dodd. A report dated 16 August
2024 (“the QBCC 15 Lynd Road
report”) was provided by Mr Rendall outlining the items of defective work
addressing the
complaints submitted by Ms Dodd.
[20] It is noted
that the reports state that payments had been made by the Applicants in the
amount of $13,683.00 (with the contract
sum being $13,683.00) for the 15 Lynd
Road property and $5,650.00 (with the contract price being $5,650.00) for the 13
property. This is not consistent with Ms Dodd’s statement but
it is not relevant for the purpose of the dispute and the claim
[21] In relation
to Ms Bolton’s complaint, one complaint was submitted regarding the 13
Lynd Road property relating to the boundary
fence between 13 Lynd Road and 15
Lynd Road, namely, that the boundary fencing is bowing at multiple points along
the fence length
and that when pushed the fence would give considerably. The
fence was considered no longer safe.
[22] Mr Rendall
concluded in the 13 Lynd Road report that the contractor had not constructed the
fence in compliance with the minimum
requirements of the National Construction
Code (“NCC”), technical sheet 20 for Timber Queensland and there was
no corrosion
protected welds to the fence support brackets.
[23] The QBCC
made the following finding:
(a) QBCC finds the contractor responsible for the construction of the fence to
comply with the minimum requirements of the NCC, technical
data sheet 20 by
Timber Queensland, AS 3660 1-2-14 Termite management and has not corrosion
protected the welds to the fence support
brackets which has reduced the
structural adequacy and is unsatisfactory.
[24] A Direction
to Rectify and/or Complete No. 011813 was issued to the Respondent on 23 January
2024 with an attached defective
work list addressing the complaint submitted by
February 2024, the QBCC advised Ms Bolton that the Respondent had not complied
with the Direction to Rectify No. 011813
and that the QBCC was unable to assist
any further with her complaint.
complaints had been made to the QBCC by Ms Dodd regarding the 15 Lynd Road
property as follows:
(a) Item 1 – 2 x retaining walls not built to standard with dirt leaking
through gaps as a result of water not draining properly;
retaining wall on
garage side creating gaps under the garage foundations;
(b) Item 2 – fence all 3 sides defective; fence leaning, not to standard;
wrong bolts/screws used or missing;
(c) Item 3 – gate not to standard; screws poking out of the posts; not
many screws used; post on termite barrier creating a
potential issue.
[27] The QBCC 15
Lynd Road report provided the following findings:
(a) Item 1:
(i) the retaining wall does not have a silt barrier installed;
(ii) the drainage system to the rear of the wall is not connected to a legal
(iii) material washed from the rear of the wall creates a health and safety
issue on the adjacent path in that the path surface becomes
slippery and unsafe;
(b) Item 2:
(i) The contractor had constructed a low-level retaining wall with a timber
paling fence attached by brackets welded to the retaining
wall posts;
(ii) The fence posts are fixing though 12 mm holes in the brackets with batten
screws which are approximately 4 mm in diameter;
(iii) The clearance around the batten screws allows the fence to move from the
(iv) The weld to the brackets has not been treated with rust protection and is a
structural support to the fence;
(v) The tops of the posts have not been cut for weathering;
(vi) There is no termite clearance between the fence and the dwelling;
(c) Item 3:
(i) The side gate had been constructed so that the post against the house has
breached the termite barrier;
(ii) There is no termite gap where the fence butts to the dwelling with a 25 mm
clearance required by AS3660 in part 2-2.
[28] In relation
to each of the items of complaint, Mr Rendall made the following
(a) Item 1:
(i) QBCC finds the contractor is responsible for the construction of the
retaining wall structures which do not meet the NCC performance
provisions, have
not been constructed to Timber Queensland Technical Data sheet 9 and create a
health and safety issue and are unsatisfactory.
(b) Item 2:
(i) QBCC finds the contractor is responsible for the constructions of the fence
and for the fence to comply with the minimum requirements
of the NCC technical
sheet 20 by Timber Queensland and AS 3660-1-2014 Termite Management and has not
constructed the fence in accordance
with those requirements and has not
corrosion protected the welds to the fence support brackets which has reduced
the structural
adequacy and is unsatisfactory.
(c) Item 3:
(i) QBCC finds the contractor is responsible for the installation of the side
gate which has breached the termite barrier creating
a path for termite attack
damaging building elements, a broken screw which is a health and safety issue
and is unsatisfactory.
[29] In respect
of all three items the QBCC determined that a Direction to Rectify should be
[30] A Direction
to Rectify or Remedy No. 0112954 dated 16 August 2024 was issued to the
Respondent in accordance with the findings
of the QBCC inspector Mr Rendall
requiring immediate action for work by a licensed contractor to address the
defective work list
September 2024, the QBCC advised Ms Dodd that the Respondent had not complied
with the Direction to Rectify and/or Complete
No. 0112954 issued on 16 August
2024 advising further that the QBCC was unable to assist the Applicants any
further with the complaint.
reports provide extensive photographic evidence of the complaints by each of the
Applicants.
satisfied on the evidence of Mr Rendall that the work provided by the Respondent
is defective and that the Respondent has
failed to repair the fence in
accordance with the Directions to Rectify.
[34] In the
circumstances, it is necessary for the Tribunal to assess the damages claimed by
the Applicant.
Applicants have not made a claim for the refund of the monies paid to an
unlicensed contractor which would have been warranted
pursuant to
Queensland Building and Construction Commission Act 1991
(Qld) (“QBCC
Act”) which specifies that an unlicensed person is prohibited from either
entering into a contract to perform
building work or actually performing
building work.
[36] Section
42(3) is said to sterilise any claim which might otherwise be made under the
contract or under common law by an unlicensed
builder. It provides that a person
who carries out building work in contravention of s 42 is not entitled to any
monetary or other
consideration for doing so.
prohibition in subsection (3) is subject to subsection (4) which provides that a
person is not prevented from claiming a
reasonable remuneration for carrying out
the building work, but only if the amount claimed is no more than the amount
paid by the
person in supplying material and labour for carrying out the
building work and does not include an allowance for the supply of the
person’s own labour and the making of a profit.
[38] For the
purpose of the Applicants’ claim it is not necessary for the Tribunal to
consider further the Applicants’
statutory entitlement.
Applicants have made a claim for damages for the rectification costs to remedy
the defective work supplied by the Respondent.
principals in relation to the assessment of damages in building disputes are
clearly set out in
Bellgrove v Eldridge
[1954] HCA 36
(1954) 90 CLR 613
The measure of damages recoverable by the building owner for the breach of the
building contract is ...the difference between the
contract price of the work or
building contracted for and the cost of making the work or building conform to
the contract, with the
addition, in most cases, of the amount of profits or
earnings lost by the breach.
[41] Damages for
defective work are generally the amount necessary to make the work conform with
what the contractor was required
to provide under the contract and thus in
accordance with the plans and specifications which formed part of
The basic purpose of an award
of damages is to restore the aggrieved party to the position which would have
been obtained had the
wrongful act not occurred. In the case of incomplete and
defective work the usual remedy will be the cost of completing building
accordance with the building contract.
qualification outlined by the High Court in
Bellgrove v Eldridge
not only must the work undertaken be necessary to produce conformity, but that
also, it must be a reasonable course to adopt.
[43] There is no
evidence to suggest that the rectification of the works involves anything less
than removal and rebuilding of the
fence. There is no evidence suggesting that
the defects could be rectified in a piecemeal manner without demolition and
rebuilding.
satisfied that it was necessary and reasonable for the Applicants to demolish
and re-build the fencing works the subject
of the contract.
[45] In support
of their claim, the Applicants have provided two quotations for the
rectification work required to the boundary fence
quotation from SD Fencing Pty Ltd details the works to be carried out and the
materials to be used with a quotation of $32,109.00
including GST.
[47] A second
quotation from Marks Landscaping and Fencing also details the work required to
remedy the defective work with a quotation
of $37,776.66 for the works.
[48] There is no
apparent reason from an assessment of the scope of works for the monetary
difference in the two quotations.
accepted that the scope of works outlined in the SD Fencing Pty Ltd quotation
will rectify the defective work and provide
the Applicants with the remedy to
which they are entitled as a result of the Respondent’s
Respondent, Benjamin Croft, is to make payment to the Applicant the sum of
$32,109.00 as damages for breach of contract,
such sum being the rectification
costs of the faulty work carried out by the Respondent.
