CONTEMPLATING THE TESTIMONY OF ‘OTHERS’: JAMES
STEPHEN, THE COLONIAL OFFICE, AND THE FATE OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL EVIDENCE
ACTS, CIRCA 1839-1849
RUSSELL SMANDYCH
In the first half of the nineteenth century, British Evangelicals played a
key role in influencing the development and implementation
of colonial
‘native policy’ throughout the British Empire. The breadth and depth
of this influence was highlighted most
tellingly in 1837 in the publication of
the House of Commons
Report from the Select Committee on Aborigines
spearheaded by Thomas Fowell Buxton, and taken up in subsequent years by the
Aborigines Protection Society.
One of the key
recommendations contained in the
, which is of primary interest in
the present study, was the recommendation that gradual steps be taken to apply
English colonial
criminal law more uniformly to Indigenous peoples across the
British Empire.
In the following decade, James
Stephen, Jr, through the influence he had as Permanent-Undersecretary of the
Colonial Office, undertook
a determined effort to persuade colonial judges and
legislatures of the need for implementing this particular Select Committee
recommendation,
in so far as it was practically feasible given the specific
circumstances that existed in particular colonies. Stephen took up the
Indigenous peoples in the mid-1830s with the same degree of Evangelical
commitment that he devoted earlier to the cause
of the abolition of slavery and
the protection of slaves in British colonial criminal
This is not to say, however, that James
Stephen, Jr, enjoyed wide-popular success in his effort to convince colonial
authorities
– in such far distance colonies as South Africa, Australia,
and New Zealand – that Indigenous peoples should receive
benefits that came with being treated as ‘British subjects’, who
were fully amenable to and protected by English
The views James Stephen held on how English law should be applied to
Indigenous peoples, as well as the frustrations he experienced
in attempting to
have them embodied in official Colonial Office policy, are revealed clearly in
the debate he became involved in
the late-1830s over the enactment of local
Aboriginal evidence ordinances in the Australian colonies of New South Wales,
Australia, and South Australia. However, Stephen’s involvement in
this debate is only one part of this important but thus far
largely unexamined
series of related comparative British colonial legal developments. In the
following article, I draw on the work
of previous Australian and comparative
legal historians who have commented on the colonial Australian Aboriginal
evidence bill debates,
as well as on a range of relevant, although apparently
largely overlooked, primary data in the form of extant Colonial Office
correspondence
and minutes often written by James Stephen, to provide a more in
depth account of this significant episode in the shift toward applying
criminal law to Indigenous peoples in nineteenth century British settler
I AUSTRALIAN AND COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS
The issue of the legal status of Indigenous peoples in the early Australian
colonies of New South Wales, Western Australia, and South
Australia has been
touched on by many legal historians, along with the debates surrounding the
enactment of early proposed Australian
Aboriginal evidence bills that were
intended to allow for the unsworn testimony of Aborigines to be accepted as
evidence in criminal
trials. As in other 19th century British settler colonies,
there was, at least initially, a great deal of uncertainty and debate
whether the Aborigines of Australia were amenable to English criminal
Like colonial judges elsewhere, as in the
Cape Colony,
and in Upper Canada and
Rupertsland,
by the mid-1840s judges in the
superior courts of New South Wales had decided a number of cases that favoured
this principle. Specifically,
R v Congo Jack Murrell
R v Bon Jon
(1841) have been well documented and frequently discussed
by legal historians, as evidence of how Aborigines in New South Wales began
be drawn into colonial courts as accused and made subject to the same penal
sanctions as non-Aboriginal settlers and convicts;
despite Judge Willis’s
opinion in the
case in favour of the
Although writers like Alex Castles
and S D Lendrum have noted that in South Australia ‘the approach taken in
only slowly gained acceptance’, by the early 1850s even
Justice Cooper of the Supreme Court began to concede ‘that where
Aborigines committed offences against each other it might be appropriate to try
them as part of the civilising mission of
Europeans’.
Although it is possible
that after 1837 it may have become increasing difficult for judges to refuse to
concede that they had jurisdiction
over Aborigines, because of the specific
directive issued ‘by the Secretary of State for the Colonial Department to
the Governor
of New South Wales requiring that thereafter all of the Aborigines
within his jurisdiction should be considered as British
little attention is given
in most legal histories of Australia to the influence the Colonial Office may
have had on the movement
toward more uniform judicial thinking about the
amenability of Aborigines to English law. For example, in this early study, Alex
Castles only alludes to the important influence of the Colonial Office, in
noting that:
official records from the first half of the nineteenth century tend to
confirm that the full recognition of the status of Aborigines
subjects was ultimately reached as a consequence of administrative directives.
In the process, it is hard to resist the
conclusion that in part at least this
was done because of the strongly-held religious and similar convictions of some
administrators
of the period.
Although Castles may also have had other mid-nineteenth century colonial
administrators in mind in this statement, as we will see
in this article, James
Stephen Jr clearly fits the description of a Colonial Office administrator who
used administrative directives
to promote the equal legal status of
Aborigines.
There are a number of studies that also make reference to related legal cases
and discussion bearing on the questions of when, historically,
did Aboriginal
testimony became an issue in Australian courts, and on how the issue was
eventually decided.
Despite its frequent
mention in passing in histories of Australia, few legal historians have devoted
detailed attention to the issue
of the admissibility of Aboriginal evidence, and
only recently have historians begun to examine the issue from a comparative
perspective.
In addition, few attempts have been made to unravel, or explain in
detail, the fate of different
Aboriginal Evidence Acts
introduced and debated in the colonies of New South Wales, Western Australia,
and South Australia, in the period from around
1839 to 1849. In the following
paper, I attempt to offer a more in depth comparative-historical account that
can help to more adequately
answer these questions. The recent comparative
studies of Jane Samson,
provide a useful starting point for
this effort.
Jane Samson provides a novel examination of the role played by the British
Royal Navy in carrying British authority to the Pacific
She points out that, far from just
physically carrying, or transporting, those who were sent to impose British
rule, captains and
senior officers of the Royal Navy who crossed the Pacific to
Australasia also brought their own views on British colonial ‘native
policy’ and the treatment of Pacific Island peoples. More specifically,
she provides evidence that most senior Naval officers
were deeply sympathetic to
Christian evangelical notions of duty and to the belief in Britain’s
civilizing mission in the colonies.
Samson also points to the close connection
and mutual humanitarian-benevolent interests that linked senior officers of the
Navy, missionaries, and evangelical groups like Thomas Fowell
Buxton’s and Saxe Bannister’s ‘Aborigines Protection
Society’. Thus, she argues that:
[a]ccording to the benevolent vision espoused by naval men and missionaries
alike, the islanders were innocents vulnerable to corruption
and prone to
violence only in retaliation for wrongs inflicted by white traders. In Christian
humanitarian rhetoric, it was the depraved
men of commerce who were the
‘savages’, whilst the islanders were dependent children, incapable
of autonomous rational
According to Samson, the outcome of this was the development of ‘a
tradition of sympathy for the deployment of British “protective
supremacy” over the Pacific Islands’ for much of the nineteenth
As part of the assertion of British ‘protective supremacy’,
British naval, as well as legal, officials were forced to
address the issue of
the amenability of newly ‘protected’ Indigenous peoples to English
law. They were also unavoidably
compelled to address the narrower – but
arguably central – issue of whether, and if so, under what specific
circumstances,
the unsworn testimony of ‘protected’ Indigenous
peoples would be admitted as evidence in colonial courts. Samson claims
1838 the Aborigines Protection Society, led by Saxe Bannister, had made
‘the issue of indigenous testimony its top
priority, hoping “to
obtain justice for natives by an improved administration of
Drawing on testimony of the Select Committee on Aborigines, Bannister
concluded that the requirement to testify under a Christian
oath unjustly
disadvantaged non-Christian peoples, especially those whose societies lacked
recognizable legal systems. If such people
could not testify, they could not
seek redress: a clear violation of their rights as British
Samson also argues that it was largely due to the influence of the Aborigines
Protection Society that in 1843 ‘the British Parliament
Colonial Evidence Act
, permitting colonies to overturn British law in
order to admit unsworn testimony’.
Although not mentioned in her book, in her more focused study of debates over
the admissibility of Aboriginal evidence in New South
Wales and British
Columbia, Samson cites James Stephen as the person who prepared the
Evidence Act
Colonial Office Secretary, Lord Stanley. Pointing to the nature and significance
of the Act of 1843, Samson notes:
This act is one of the most important and certainly one of the most neglected
pieces of legislation on colonial aboriginal issues.
Its preamble noted the
injustices caused by the inadmissibility of Aboriginal evidence in British
colonies of settlement, and called
for the usual role of legal compatibility to
be overturned to permit unsworn testimony in the colonies. All the Legislative
had to do was to pass their own enabling legislation. It is worth
noting that Stanley’s bill passed completely unopposed in
Parliament and
caused no visible backlash − indeed, no comment − in the major
newspapers or periodicals of the day. We
are now a very long way from the
popular view that British officials deliberately manipulated the law to enable
atrocities against
indigenous peoples.
While Samson credits the Aborigines Protection Society with advancing a
persuasive general humanitarian argument in favour of legislation
enacted in 1843, she also examines more closely some of the specific events
behind the legislation. These include the earlier
disallowance of an Aborigines
Evidence Bill introduced by New South Wales Attorney General John Plunkett in
1838 after the Myall
Creek Massacre investigation, and Colonial Secretary Lord
Russell’s subsequent urging of New South Wales Governor Gipps in
‘to hasten the creation of special provisions to allow Aborigines to
testify unsworn because the present system, based
on the principle of equality
before the law, was producing obvious
injustice’.
Samson also mentions
Governor Gipp’s failure after 1843 to get an Aboriginal evidence act
passed in New South Wales, because
of the growing influence of emancipists like
W C Wentworth, who ‘opposed a bill they denounced as sentimentalist
Lauren Benton also provides a helpful comparative starting point for
re-examining the manner in which Australian Aborigines were made
fully subject
to British colonial law, including laws relating to the admissibility of
evidence. In her important recent work on
Law and Colonial Cultures: Legal
Regimes in World History, 1400-1900
, she notes that throughout European
history law has ‘worked both to tie disparate parts of empires and to lay
the basis for
exchanges of all sorts between politically and culturally separate
imperial or colonial powers’.
Benton’s research covers legal regimes ranging from those that existed in
early Catholic and Islamic empires, to those put
into place by European
colonizers in Bengal, West Africa, the Cape Colony and New South Wales, and
Uruguay. In the course of this
sweeping comparative historical analysis, she
manages to offer a number of intriguing generalizations. The most important of
for the purposes of the current study, is her argument the development of
colonial legal regimes in the nineteenth century occurred
at least ‘in
part as a response to conflicts over the legal status of indigenous subjects and
cultural others’.
More specifically,
Benton contends that from the late eighteenth century on ‘[a]ttention
focused in particular on debates about
the legal status of indigenous peoples
and, especially, the definition of roles for cultural and legal
intermediaries’. In
the process, ‘[l]egal actors played upon these
tensions in crafting legal strategies that often involved appeals to state law,
even before the colonial state had articulated claims to
sovereignty’.
In addition to highlighting the central importance of examining debates over
the legal status of Indigenous peoples and at the manner
in which they were
brought within the grasp on formal state-enacted colonial law, Benton offers a
comparative account of the application
of state law to Indigenous peoples in the
Cape Colony and New South Wales as a specific example of this type of historical
Specifically, Benton provides a comparative analysis of changes that
occurred in the treatment of Indigenous peoples as ‘subjects
witnesses’ in the colonial criminal courts of the Cape Colony and New
South Wales from the late 1700s to the 1830s. According
to Benton, across these
two jurisdictions ‘colonial legal politics produced substantially
different outcomes’. Whereas
in the Cape Colony ‘establishing
British hegemony over Dutch-descended settlers involved the strategic acceptance
of indigenous
Khoi as legal witnesses and litigants’, in New South Wales
‘the conflict over the legal status of convict settlers encapsulated
debates about the legal standing of Aborigines and reinforced their systematic
exclusion as legal actors’. Despite these different
politically influenced
outcomes, Benton maintains that in broader structural terms the two cases were
similar in that they both represented
a shift from a form of ‘weak’
to a form of ‘strong’ legal pluralism, in which state law became
more dominant.
Benton’s account of changes in the legal status of Aborigines in New
South Wales deserves further mention as it is particularly
relevant to the
attempt made in the present study to examine the New South Wales experience
alongside that of Western Australia and
South Australia. In essence, Benton
argues that in New South Wales debates over the legal status of Aborigines were
intertwined with
debates over the legal status of former convicts (or
‘emancipists’) who in the mid-1820s began arguing for the same
and legal rights as those held by other white colonists. According to
Benton ‘[i]n seeking to redefine themselves as the legal
and political
equals of other whites, emancipists sought to emphasize the cultural gulf that
divided former convicts, and whites
in general, from
Aborigines’.
Benton’s argument
of the link between failure to enact an Aboriginal evidence act in New South
Wales after 1843 and debate
over legal rights of Aborigines versus emancipists
is consistent with Jane Samson’s passing reference to the same conclusion.
It is also consistent with the earlier work of Australian legal historians,
including Alex Castles
who refer to the infamous William
Charles Wentworth in their discussion of the reasons for the failure of New
South Wales to enact
an Aboriginal evidence act. Interestingly, however, it
would appear that none of these authors provide a very thorough examination
relevant direct documentary evidence on how prominent former convicts in the
colony in fact lobbied to restrict the legal rights
of Aborigines as a strategy
for increasing the legitimacy of their own claim for equal rights. In addition,
it is also notable that
none of these authors mentions very much about the
nature and extent of James Stephen’s involvement in the debate over
Aboriginal evidence bills in the period from 1839 to the mid-1840s.
In the following parts of this paper, attention is given to examining
documents that help to shed additional light on the fate of the first Aboriginal
evidence acts of New South Wales, Western
Australia, and South Australia.
II NEW SOUTH WALES: THE FATE OF THE ABORIGINAL EVIDENCE ACTS
OF 1839 AND 1841
As Alex C Castles wrote in his early chapter on ‘Aborigines and
European Law’, it was one thing for the British Colonial
strongly affirm that Aborigines ‘were to be treated as British subjects
for all purposes’ and that ‘they
were to be accorded the full
protection of European law’, while it was another to actually
‘ensure that justice could
be achieved effectively and fairly in legal
proceedings involving many
Aborigines’.
The discrepancy that
existed between ideal of equality before the law, argued for by Colonial Office
officials like James Stephen,
Jr, and reality of unequal justice for Aborigines
and colonists in Australian criminal courts, becomes clearly evident in the
that emerged in the 1830s surrounding the issue of the admissibility of
unsworn Aboriginal testimony in criminal trials and the need
for colonial
legislation to address the issue.
It appears that prior to the 1830s it was simply assumed that Aborigines were
incapable of providing testimony in criminal trials.
As early as 1805, colonial
courts in Australia began to raise the question of whether courts could hear
pleas from Aborigines who
did not understand either the language or procedure of
British courts.
In a legal opinion on
‘The Treatment of Natives,’ written in July 1805, Judge-Advocate
Atkins addressed this issue in
light of reported ‘Outrages committed by
the Natives of the Hawkesbury, &c’ against white settlers. In his
the fact that ‘evidence of Persons not bound by any moral or
religious Tye can never be considered or construed as legal evidence’
it impossible, under existing law, to bring a Native to trial for a crime
committed against a settler. In light of this, Atkins
endorsed the practice of
settlers carrying out reprisals against Natives by pursuing and inflicting
‘such punishment as they
The punishments ultimately
inflicted on the Aborigines for committing the ‘outrage’ of killing
two settlers and two stockmen
near Hawkesbury, involved the use of both
‘blood-for-blood’ reprisal and less brutal measures which included
imprisonment and forced labour. In a letter he wrote to Earl Camden
less than two weeks after receiving Atkins’ legal opinion,
Governor Philip
Gidley King elaborated on how he dealt with the outrage, noting that
‘[s]ix of the Native and those the most
Guilty were Shot in a pursuit by
the Settlers’ and the natives ‘late excesses’ were terminated
by their voluntary
giving up the other aggressors for confinement in the jail at
Parramatta. He further remarked that:
Yet as Two Black Men more than Settlers have been shot, I shall forego any
farther retaliation, but as they were so desirous of shewing
their Sorrow for
what had passed by giving up the Delinquents and requiring them to be punished,
I should try the expedient of sending
them to another Settlement to labour which
has been much approved by the rest.
These types of ‘blood-for-blood’ reprisals and less
‘coercive Measures’ were no doubt used frequently prior
to the 1830s
and rationalized by colonizers and the judiciary as being necessary in light of
the belief that Aborigines were in amenable
to ordinary English law and criminal
However, all colonial officials
did not support these measures. In 1824, Saxe Bannister, then Attorney General
of New South Wales,
made the opposite complaint in the letter he wrote to
Colonial Office Under-Secretary Wilmot
Bannister remarked on the
continuing ‘denial of Justice’ caused to ‘Black Natives’
by the fact that a law
had not yet been enacted to allow them to testify in
court without taking an oath. More specifically, Bannister wrote in this regard
Mr Forbes has mentioned a point with regard to the Black Natives, which I
most cordially agree with him upon. They have not that sense
of religion, which
authorises the taking of an oath by any form. The consequence is a very frequent
denial of Justice to them. I
have no doubt of the present disturbance in the
mountains and near Bathurst being most to be attributed to a gross case of this
The remedy will be in an Act of Parliament enacting that, from certain
persons, evidence may be taken without oath. The religious
sanction is one only
of many, and with these people it does not exist in this shape. Without the
passing of such an act as this,
the Act of Parliament of last year with respect
to the New Zealanders and others will in many instances be perfectly
inoperative.
The impropriety of the rule of law cannot be shewn more
In November 1824, Bannister wrote an addendum to this letter, in which he
noted that ‘It has, since the writing of this letter,
occurred to me that
the council here might pass a local act on the subject with a special clause of
suspension, inasmuch as the change
of principle is
considered’.
While Bannister appears
to have been among the first to propose enacting either a British, or
alternatively a local colonial, statute
to enable Aborigines to testify in
criminal trials, others soon followed. In addition, increasingly after the
mid-1820s, issues surrounding
the admissibility of Aboriginal evidence began to
be raised more frequently in cases that came before the Supreme Court of New
In the case of
R v Fitzpatrick and Colville
(1824) Chief Justice
Forbes asserted that ‘the best evidence’ for the charge was not
available because of the inadmissibility
of testimony by an Aboriginal witness.
In this case Bullwaddy, an Aboriginal man, witnessed Fitzpatrick killing a
Shepard named Bentley
and reported that information to a constable. A second
accused, Colville, who was also indicted but subsequently acquitted of the
murder, and another man, Sears, offered corroborative testimony of the facts of
In her analysis of this case,
Nancy Wright notes that it is significant that Chief Justice Forbes paid
attention to Bullwaddy’s
statement made to another witness in his decision
to convict Fitzpatrick, even though he, and later Governor Brisbane who reviewed
Forbes decision, considered it only as corroborating evidence. Specifically,
Wright notes that Chief Justice Forbes ‘respited
Fitzpatrick’ after
his conviction in order to allow Governor Brisbane to allow Governor Brisbane to
consider the case, ‘in
Forbes’s words, “divested [of] those
restraints which the strict rules of evidence, imposed upon the Court at the
and with that light which the evidence or statement of Bullwaddy will in
all probability throw upon it”’. Subsequently,
Brisbane reported his
decision back to Forbes that, based upon Bullwaddy’s testimony, he was
‘against exercising the
prerogative of mercy on Fitzpatrick’s
In this instance, Brisbane
himself questioned Bullwaddy, after the Attorney General brought him before
With respect to the overall legal
significance of this case, Wright concludes that:
The admission of the testimony of Aboriginal witnesses in extrajudicial
circumstances [like those involving Bullwaddy], however, did
not construe it as
legal evidence. Instead it was weighed as corroborating information upon the
discretion of the governor in his
capacity to exercise the royal prerogative of
mercy. As a result it did nothing to implement and exercise the rights of
people as British subjects.
In the case of
(1834) an Aboriginal native was committed
for trial for the wilful murder of a white stockman, John
At the trial, the Reverend L E
Threlkeld ‘was sworn interpreter between the Court and the prisoner at
bar’. Threlkeld
was assisted by another Aborigine, who could understand
English, but who could not be sworn as an interpreter because, it was said,
had ‘no religion at all’. In the course of the trial, when the
accused’s defence counsel, Mr Nichols, was asked
by the Solicitor General
if he could produce any witnesses for the defence, he said he could not
‘because he was unable to
converse with the prisoner as to the merits of
the case; and if he could produce any, their evidence would not be
According to the trial records, ‘The Solicitor-General
denied that this was a necessary cenclusion [sic], upon which Mr Nichols
into the witness box the aboriginal native, who was assisting [sic] Mr Threlkeld
as interpreter.’ In the ensuing conversation
over ‘the capability of
the natives imbibing any religious impressions, or of their believing in any
future state of rewards
or punishments’, Mr Threlkeld stated ‘that
the black man in the witness box believed in the existence of a divinity and
future state, because he had told him so, and not from any belief of his own on
the subject’. When ‘the court enquired
whether the man tendered as a
witness could speak to any of the facts’, Mr Nichols ‘replied in the
negative – his
object was to prove by illustration the impossibility of
tendering witnesses for the defence’. The accused was subsequently
convicted of manslaughter and ‘sentenced to be transported from the Colony
for the term of his natural life’.
The problem of how to accommodate the unsworn testimony of Aborigines was
also addressed in the case
R vs Jack Congo Murrell
(1836), heard by Chief
Justice Forbes, and Justices Dowling and
This was the case in which
Murrell’s barrister, Sydney Stephen argued that the Aborigines had their
own laws and that they
‘were given no protection by European law’
partly because ‘they were unable to given evidence as witnesses’.
reported in the
Sydney Gazette
on 23 February 1836, Stephen specifically
argued that:
The reason why subjects of Great Britain were bound by the laws of their own
country was, that they were protected by them; the natives
were not protected by
those laws, they were not admitted witnesses in Courts of Justice they could not
claim any civil rights they
could not obtain recovery of, or compensation for,
those lands which had been torn from them, and which they had held probably for
centuries. It therefore followed they were not bound by laws which did not at
the same time afford them protection. If it was held
that they were subjects of
Great Britain, then they would have a right to come into the Courts, and sue for
any property they might
possess, for assaults and cases of that kind. Again,
providing the Court was to try this man, they would have to follow him with
shield of the law to prevent his being tried by his own tribe according to their
laws. How could oaths be framed that would be
binding on these men?
Although Murrell was found not guilty on the facts, the court disagreed with
Stephen’s argument, declaring that Aborigines accused
of killing other
Aborigines were fully subject to British law. According to the report that
appeared in the
Sydney Herald
on 18 April 1836 describing the judgement
in the case delivered by Mr Justice Burton:
The learned Judge read a very elaborate review of all the bearings of the
case − the principles which it involved - and the
consequences which might
ensue if it were to be held that the Aboriginal Natives might murder each other
uncontrolled by the English
law; and concluded by expressing an opinion (in
which the other Judges entirely concurred) that the Act of Parliament having
the Supreme Court jurisdiction over all offences against British law,
within certain prescribed limits, they could, within those
limits, recognise no
distinction between Natives and Europeans.
It appears that, in the end, it was the Myall Creek trials that provided the
major impetus for the attempt made to enact an Aboriginal
evidence act in New
South Wales in 1839. In July 1839, Colonial Office Secretary Lord Normanby wrote
to Governor Gipps, referring
to the fact that Her Majesty’s government
‘has been recently called to the necessity of making provision for
the evidence of Aboriginal Natives in Courts of Justice’. He
went on to note that: ‘This, however, is a question which
I consider it
better to leave to you to bring before the local Legislature, convinced that it
will receive that consideration, which
so important a question
Gipps did not need very much convincing from Normanby, as he had already
himself had begun to press for the admissibility of Aboriginal
evidence in
courts of law, following the Myall Creek trials. According to R H W
Reece’s early account:
One of the aspects of the Myall Creek trials which had attracted [Gipps]
attention was the difficulty of calling as a witness the
Aboriginal stockman
Davey who had seen the massacre and could probably have testified to the degree
of culpability of each of the
eleven men. In order to remedy this anomaly, and
in anticipation of a request from the Marquess of Normanby who had succeeded
Gipps in September 1839 introduced in the Legislative Council a Bill
designed to raise the evidence of Aborigines taken without a
Bible oath to the
. This meant that evidence from Aboriginal witnesses
could be accepted by a court if it was supported by corroborative evidence from
other sources.
The New South Wales bill was actually drafted earlier, in 1838, by Justice
Burton, who then forwarded it to Governor Gipps for his
consideration, along
with a letter explaining the object of the bill and his views respecting
Aborigines.
On 17 August 1839, James
Stephen’s immediate superior, Colonial Office Parliamentary
Under-Secretary Labouchere, wrote to Justice
Burton, who was at this time in
London, stating that:
I am directed by the Marquis of Normanby to transmit to you the Copy of a
Communication from the Committee of the Aborigines Protection
Society urging
that the Natives in the Australian Colonies should be admitted to give Evidence
in the Courts of Law; and I am to
request that you will state for his
Lordship’s information whether in point of fact any objection has ever
been made to admit
the Evidence of the Aborigines in the Courts of New South
Wales, and if so in what manner you conceive that defect in the administration
of Justice could be most properly
Justice Burton replied to Labouchere the same day, informing him that in the
past objections were ‘made and sustained by the
Supreme Court of New South
Wales to the admission of such evidence’ on two grounds. The first ground,
he said, was where it
had ‘been impossible to communicate with a proposed
witness on account of his ignorance of the English Language, and where
Interpreter could be procured to interpret between him and the Court’, and
the second, was where ‘a proposed witness’
was ‘found to be
ignorant of a Supreme Being and a future
Burton went on to provide
Labouchere with his opinion on the expediency of enacting ameliorative
legislation, along with an overview
of his own role in bringing forth such
legislation in New South Wales. Burton stated that:
Whether it is expedient to introduce into the Australian Colonies any
modification of the English Law of Evidence now existing there
involved in His Lordship’s Enquiry, and I conceive that, in certain cases
where the matter at issue is of minor
consideration, the statements of the
Aborigines might be received as evidence; and I had the honour of preparing a
Bill for their
Protection in New South Wales, in which that principle is
recognized and acted upon; it was transmitted by me to His Excellency the
Governor, Sir Geo Gipps, together with a letter explanatory of its intention in
the Month of June, 1838, but was not laid as I hoped
it would be by His
Excellency before the Legislative Council in consequence, as I presumed, of a
recommendation of the Committee
of the House of Commons, that no measure of that
kind should be of Colonial Origin.
Burton also noted that his ‘rough Draft of the Bill’ and letter
to Governor Gipps had been already transmitted to the
Colonial Office, and that
he conceived that the proposed Act ‘would give satisfaction to the Friends
of the Aborigines both
in England and in the Colony, if it were
It is clear from
Burton’s letter, along with other correspondence, that the Aborigines
Protection Society did indeed play a
key role in raising the issue of the need
for an Aboriginal evidence act in New South Wales. In the statement of the
Aborigines Protection
Society originally sent to Lord Normanby in July 1839, the
Society stated that:
Amongst various points which have engaged the attention of the Aborigines
Protection Society as necessary to ensure the safety and
elevation of the
uncivilized Natives of those parts of the Globe, on which British Colonies or
Settlements are formed, the subject
of their admission to give Evidence in Our
Courts of Law has repeatedly excited particular
The statement went on to highlight the attention that was being directed at
the issue by Barton Hack, one of the ‘corresponding
Members’ of the
Aborigines Protection Society from Adelaide, and the bill the Society had
prepared ‘which they hoped
would be passed with the concurrence and
support of Her Majesty’s Government.’ However, alluding to the
ultimate power
wielded by the Colonial Office regarding the matter of
recommending British Parliamentary acts that were binding on all British
the Aborigines Protection Society further added that:
Intimation ... having reached the Committee of the Society that the course
which it was prepared to take did not meet the approbation
of the Colonial
Office, it was determined to suspend the further prosecution of the Bill and
again address the Colonial Office in
the hope that the appeal, which they now
offer, limited as it is to the subject of Evidence and confined to the
Aborigines of Australia
or to the Australians and the Islands of the Pacific,
will not be made in vain. The Committee cannot but anticipate that the effectual
carrying out of measures, calculated to secure the object which the Bill in
question was destined to obtain, will prove so real a
boon to the Native
population and so important to the respectable Class of British Emigrants, so
decided a check to evil doers, and
so satisfactory to the friends of humanity in
this Country, that it may be speedily followed up by similar measures applicable
all the Courts in Our Colonies and
Dependencies.
By the end of August, 1839, Lord Normanby wrote a despatch (No 134) to
Governor Gipps, transmitting copies of the recent correspondence
Labourchere and Justice Burton ‘relative to the question of admitting the
evidence of the Aborigines in the Courts
of Justice in New South
In light of this
correspondence, Normanby said it seemed desirable to him that Gipps
‘should submit to the Legislative Council
some well digested plan for
obviating such impediments as prevent the admission of the testimony of the
Aborigines in Judicial proceedings’.
By October 1839, the Legislature of
New South Wales had passed an Act (No 16) ‘to allow the Aboriginal Natives
of New South
Wales to be received as Competent Witnesses in Criminal
cases’. It is significant, however, that his Act was limited in that
allowed Aboriginal testimony to be given only ‘so much weight as
corroborating circumstances may entitle it to’. More
specifically, that
Act required that testimony of Aborigines should be corroborated with evidence
provided by ‘European witnesses’.
Consequently, as Alex Castles
notes, in light of the evidentiary rule ‘that evidence could not be used
for corroborative purposes
where this also had to be corroborated ... under this
scheme, the evidence of one Aborigine might not be used to corroborate the
evidence of another’.
In addition, a
clause was added to the Act which prevented it from taking effect until it was
approved by ‘her Majesty’;
which occurred normally by recommendation
of the Colonial Office. On 14 October 1839, Gipps wrote to Normanby, informing
circumstances that led to the enactment of the legislation and the
inclusion of the noted specific clauses, stating:
Herewith I have the honour to transmit to your Lordship an Act passed in the
present session of the Legislative Council to allow the
aboriginal natives of
New South Wales to be received as competent witnesses in criminal cases,
notwithstanding that they have not
at present any distinct idea of religion, or
any fixed belief in a future state of rewards and punishments.
This Act is transmitted separately to your Lordship in consequence of a
clause having been added to it by the Council, preventing
its taking effect in
the Colony until it shall have been approved by Her Majesty.
The measure was introduced at the desire of the Attorney-general [J H
Plunkett], in consequence of the difficulty in obtaining convictions
experienced in several cases, wherein native blacks have been concerned, either
as the accused or the injured party, and
the dissatisfaction which has been
expressed in the colony when a criminal has escaped.
The clause preventing the Act from coming into operation until Her
Majesty’s pleasure shall be known, was added at the request
of the Chief
Justice, who, though friendly to the measure, would otherwise have felt himself,
as probably would also his brother
judges, compelled to remonstrate against the
act as repugnant to the Laws of
Just over year later, in December 1840, Governor Gipps wrote to C J La Trobe,
the newly appointed Superintendent of the Port Phillip
District, stating that he
was confident that the Act would soon receive Royal
However, as we know, this was not
to be the case. Upon being received by the Colonial Office, the Act was referred
to the Attorney
and Solicitor General of England for his consideration. The
Attorney General in turn passed on the Act to two barristers, J Campbell
Thos Wilde, who were asked to offer a legal opinion. On 11 August 1840, the new
Colonial Secretary, Lord John Russell, wrote
a despatch (No 127) to Governor
Gipps, in which he informed him that the Act had been disallowed, and enclosed a
copy of the report
written by Campbell and Wilde that, he said, showed
‘the motives by which I was induced to advise Her Majesty to disallow the
The report written by Campbell
and Wilde, dated 27 July 1840, read:
Having duly considered the Act passed by the Legislative Council of New South
Wales ‘To allow the Aboriginal Natives of New
South Wales to be received
as competent witnesses in Criminal Cases,’ transmitted to us by your
Lordship’s directions,
we have to report to your Lordship that in our
opinion it cannot properly be submitted to The Queen for confirmation.
To admit in a Criminal Case the evidence of a witness acknowledged to be
ignorant of the existence of a God or a future state would
be contrary to the
principles of British jurisprudence; and the Act is loosely worded with respect
to the admission of which evidence
and the weight to be given to it that we do
not think it could be attended with any advantage.
We should have supposed that the Aboriginal Natives might have been
sufficiently instructed before being produced as witnesses to
render their
evidence admissible according to the established rules of Law, which do not
define the distinctness of Religious ideas
or to what degree the belief in a
future state is to be fixed to qualify a witness to take an
It is important to note that while Lord Russell felt obligated to accept the
legal opinion that led to the disallowance of the New
South Wales Act of 1839,
this did not mean he (or his highest-ranking civil servant, James Stephen, Jr)
agreed with the opinion of
the learned barristers. Among other sources, evidence
of this is provided in the despatch Lord Russell wrote to Governor Gipps two
months later, on 8 October 1840, in which he enclosed a copy of a report which
he received ‘from Captain Grey, late commandant
of an expedition into the
interior of Australia’, which he said contained ‘some valuable
suggestions with regard to the
treatment of the
aborigines’.
Captain Grey’s
report included 37 itemized issues and suggestions related to the treatment of
Aborigines, four of which related
directly to the issue of the admissibility of
Aboriginal evidence. First, Grey observed that the greatest obstacle that
itself in considering the application of British law to Aborigines was
the fact, that ‘from their ignorance of the nature of
an oath, or of the
obligations it imposes, they are not competent to give evidence before a court
of justice’, and that ‘hence,
in many cases, it would be extremely
difficult, if not impossible, to obtain evidence on which a prisoner could be
convicted’.
Secondly, he advised that one ‘mode of evading this
difficulty’ would be to empower courts ‘to receive evidence
natives in all causes relating solely to themselves without the witness being
sworn, only allowing testimony of this nature
to hold good when borne out by
very strong circumstantial evidence’, while at the same time also
‘empower the court always
to receive evidence from natives called on by a
native prisoner in his defence, such evidence being subject to the before named
restrictions’.
Thirdly, Grey reiterated the point made by some previous
sympathetic observers (like Saxe Bannister), that the fact that natives
‘unable to give testimony in a court of justice is a great hardship on
them,’ and that ‘they consider it as
such’. Grey added that:
‘the reason that occasions their disability for the performance of this
function is at present
quite beyond their comprehension and it is impossible to
explain it to them’.
elaborated that he had been ‘a personal witness to a case in which a
native was most undeservedly punished, from
the circumstance of the natives, who
were the only persons who could speak as to certain exculpatory facts, not being
permitted to
give their evidence.’ Fourthly, he pointed out that it was
clear from his experience that ‘[t]here are certain forms
in our colonial
courts of justice, as at present conducted, which it is impossible to make a
savage comprehend’. Specifically,
he noted an instance of a court of
quarter sessions he attended ‘at which a number of natives were tried on a
great variety
of charges’. He commented that:
Several of them were induced to plead guilty, and on this admission of their
having committed the crime, sentence was pronounced upon
them. But when others
denied their guilt, and found that this denial produced no corresponding result
in their favour, whilst at
the same time they were not permitted to bring
forward other natives to deny it also, and to explain the matter for them, they
perfectly confounded.
Grey reported that he ‘was subsequently applied to by several
intelligent natives to explain this mystery to them’, but
‘failed in giving such an explanation as would satisfy
The legal opinion that led to the disallowance of the Act of 1839 was not
received favourably by Governor Gipps. In a despatch he
subsequently wrote to
Lord Russell, dated 7 April 1841, in reply to his despatch containing Captain
Grey’s report, Gipps was
critical of the fact that Russell’s
predecessor ‘had disallowed the colonial Act which would have made special
for the admission of Aboriginal
testimony’.
It is interesting,
however, that Gipps appears to have been displeased with the disallowance as
much for the effect he saw it having
in allowing Aborigines to get away with
crimes they should be convicted for, as for the effect it would have in allowing
get away with crimes committed against Aborigines. Specifically, Gipps
remarked to Lord Russell:
It seems to me, however, right to point out to Your Lordship that the
inadmissibility of their evidence acts perhaps quite as often
in favour of the
aborigines as against them. The hardship of the exclusion of evidence that might
be favourable to them, is always
urged on the jury, both by their counsel and by
the judge, and is again taken into consideration by the executive in carrying
effect the judgment of the court. The admission indeed of their evidence
was in 1839 as much called for in New South Wales by parties
who had suffered
from the aggressions of the blacks, as by those who advocate their civilization;
and complaints have long been loud
amongst our settlers that, whilst the
penalties of the law are rigorously enforced against persons who commit violence
on the aborigines,
the aborigines themselves are, when brought into our courts,
almost invariably acquitted.
Gipps went on to point out that he believed the frequent acquittal of
Aborigines was actually unfavourable to their interests in that
it engendered a
disposition ‘in the minds of the less principled portion of the white
population to take the law into their
own hands’. A good example of this,
he said, was the Myall Creek case that occurred nearly three years ago, in which
less than 28 aboriginal natives were barbarously murdered’ in
‘an act of atrocity for which ... seven white men paid
the forfeit of
their lives on the scaffold’.
On 24 January 1842, Gipps wrote the new Colonial Office Secretary, Lord
Stanley, reporting on the controversy surrounding Judge Willis’s
case, and asking for a ‘declaratory law’ to be
passed affirming that Aborigines ‘are amenable to British law for
continued in a subsequent despatch to Lord Stanley, dated 11 March 1842, to
provide the Colonial Office with further evidence
of the ‘the legal
disabilities’ of Aborigines and the ‘necessity of admitting the
evidence of natives in courts
One piece of evidence Gipps
offered was the annual report of the mission to the Aborigines at Wellington
Valley, in which it was
stated that:
It is indeed strange that, whilst the Aborigines are pronounced amenable to
the English laws, and considered British Subjects, they
are not dealt with as in
such a condition, being allowed practices repugnant to our laws, injurious to
their, as well as, European
interests...
Gipps also enclosed a letter from Mr Hurst to Superintendent Latrobe, dated
22 July 1841, which provided details about a murder case
that was said to
illustrate the problems posed by not allowing Aborigines to testify in criminal
trials. In his letter, Hurst argued
that to help save the Aborigines from such
murderous acts it would be proper to allow ‘the Aborigines to give
evidence in Court
whether a native or a European be the offending party’.
Hurst said that while he was ready to ‘admit that their testimony
be received with caution, from the circumstances of their not being fully
acquainted with the solemn obligations of an oath’,
at the same time, he
was of the opinion, ‘that when it is corroborated by circumstantial
evidence, it should be received’.
Nor, Hurst said, did he see ‘how
they can be protected, or how justice can be done to them, unless some provision
meet their case in this
Gipps’ despatch also
included an enclosed letter from the Chief Protector’s Office to
Superintendent Latrobe, dated 11
December 1841, which claimed that: ‘The
lives of Aboriginal natives known to have been destroyed, are many, and if the
of Natives be admissible, the amount would be great indeed’, but
that, ‘even in cases where the Aborigines are said to
be the aggressors,
who can tell what latent provocation existed for perpetrating
In addition, in his letter the
Chief Protector lamented the inability of both himself and the Assistant
Protector ‘to afford
protection, or administer justice to the Aboriginal
Natives,’ and that both ‘have invariably complained, and have urged
that the subject might be brought under the early notice of the
Government’. Writing personally, he said: ‘I also have
felt myself
powerless; and although frequently applied to for protection, and for justice, I
have felt unable in some cases, owing
to the legal disabilities of the
Aborigines, to do so’.
In despatches
he wrote to Lord Stanley in the spring of 1843 and 1844, Gipps included more
evidence of the displeasure some voiced
to the disallowance of ameliorative
legislation, including copies of relevant annual reports he received from G A
Robinson, the Chief
Protector of Aborigines. In his report for 1842, Robinson
complained that:
At present the evidence of aboriginal natives, by reason of their ignorance
of the knowledge of God, is inadmissible in our courts
of law; and hence,
properly qualified religious instructors, to impart to them the truths of
Christianity, and prepare them for the
reception of their legal rights, as
proposed by the Right honourable the Secretary of State, is, in consequence,
absolutely needed.
It were much to be regretted that the Colonial Act of Council
on aboriginal evidence was disallowed, for it frequently happens that
of this evidence the highest and foulest crimes go
unpunished.
In its report to Governor Gipps the following year, Robinson again pointed
There is ... reason to fear that the destruction of the aboriginal natives
has been accelerated from the known fact of their being
incapacitated to give
evidence in our courts of law. I have frequently had to deplore, when applied to
by the aborigines for justice
in cases of aggression committed on them by white
men, or by those of their own race, my inability to do so in consequence of
legal incapacity to give
As in New South Wales, not everyone in the Colonial Office agreed with the
legal opinion that led to the disallowance of the Aboriginal
bill of 1839. This was especially true of James Stephen, Jr, who was,
without question, the one person in the Colonial Office who
knowledgeable about the challenges faced in attempting to adapt English laws of
evidence to the specific circumstances of
nineteenth century British slave
colonies and settler societies.
hand-written minute, dated 20 April 1840, he pencilled on the back of the 14
October 1839 despatch Gibbs sent Normanby, Stephen
(as cited by Alan G L Shaw)
wrote that he thought the Act was necessary and valid, and that any doubts about
it arose from a ‘misapprehension
of the sense of the words in the
act’ forbidding its repugnancy to the laws of
The full citation to
Stephen’s minute of 20 April 1840 (from the original held in the PRO),
reveals even more clearly that
Stephen was fully in favour of the proposed
legislation and critical of the justices of the Supreme Court of New South Wales
questioned its validity. More fully, Stephen wrote:
I should entertain [crossed out] feel no difficulty in expressing the opinion
that this was an Act proper to be confirmed, but for
the doubt which the
Colonial Judges are said to entertain, whether it is not ‘repugnant to the
Law of England’. To myself,
that doubt appears to rest upon a
misapprehension of the sense of those words in the Act of Parliament, which
forbids the enactment
of Colonial Laws, ‘repugnant to the Law of
England’. The expression, as I conceive, means only to prevent a direct
of authority between the Imperial & the Colonial Legislatures. To
construe it as meaning that all laws of local origin shall
be framed on the mode
of the same English law, would be to attribute to Parliament the absurdity of
requiring an identity of Legislation
under an inherent dissimilarity of
circumstances. If we had a race of aboriginal savages in England, I presume we
should make such
a Law as the present. At least I am convinced that we ought to
make such an [sic] one. Therefore, I infer, that the Legislature of
Wales ought to do the same, and may lawfully do it. Perhaps, however, the case
should be referred to the Law Officers of
Stephen’s minute is followed by another minute, dated 23 April 1840,
which appears to have been written by Colonial Secretary
Lord John Russell,
which reads:
Perhaps so, [illegible] I agree with J Stephen. I understand ‘repugnant
to the Laws of England’ to mean the general principles
of those laws
– such as torturing a prisoner to make him confess his guilt and − I
do not think in this case there is
such repugnancy, but we had better ask the
Law Officers.
This document, which to my knowledge has not been cited in full in any other
published secondary literature, shows that Stephen was
extremely interested in
and concerned about the treatment of Aborigines in the legal system of New South
Wales, and that he believed
that – as in the case of
– one way to try to protect
them through the law was to make the testimony of Aboriginal witnesses
admissible in criminal trials.
Evidence that Stephen was successful in
convincing his superiors in the Colonial Office that further steps should be
taken in this
direction exists in the despatch Lord Stanley sent to Governor
Gipps in December 1842, in which he remarked that:
[A]greeing as I do in the general opinion, that it is indispensable to the
protection of the natives that their evidence should, to
a certain extent at
least, be received in the courts of law, I shall take into my consideration the
means by which this can be effected
in the safest and most satisfactory
Ultimately, the measure finally resorted to by Lord Stanley was to have James
Stephen draft an
Colonial Evidence Act
for passage by the British
Parliament what would enable individual colonies to enact local Aboriginal
evidence bills. Indicatively,
on 31 March 1843, Lord Stanley received a legal
opinion from barristers T Pollock and W W Pollett regarding the validity of the
bill, in which they mentioned the specific reason Stanley decided to
proceed by way of passing an Act through the British Parliament,
leaving the colonies without any specific guidance in this matter. The
barristers acknowledged receiving the ‘Draft
of a Bill’ Stanley
proposed ‘to submit to Parliament in the present session, to enable
colonial legislatures to pass
laws authorizing the admission of native testimony
though unsworn, in courts of justice within the colonies’. They noted that
Stanley had been led led to propose the adoption of this measure in consequence
of the objections raised by us in our Reports of
the 26th October and 24th
December last, ‘as well as by the Report of our predecessors, to the
confirmation of local Acts passed
by the respective governments of New South
Wales and of Western Australia for that purpose’. They further noted for
that Stanley’s secretary, Mr Hope, had requested that they
‘take the enclosed draft into our consideration, and report
Lordship our opinion whether there is anything objectionable in the draft as at
present framed, and, if so, in what respect
it would require amendment’.
In response to this request, the barristers stated that ‘we have taken
this matter into
our consideration and have perused the draft of the proposed
Bill, and beg leave to report to your Lordship that we see nothing objectionable
in the draft as present framed’.
Four months later, on 6 July 1843, Stanley wrote a short despatch to Gipps in
which he included a copy of the
Colonial Evidence Act
passed by the
British Parliament, and tersely noted that:
The circumstances which have given rise to the passing of the Act have been
so fully entered into in previous correspondence that
it is only necessary for
me now to instruct you to propose to the Legislative Council of New South Wales
a law for giving effect
to the provisions of the Act of
Parliament.
Shortly, we will turn to looking at how Western Australia and South Australia
managed to enact local evidence bills along the lines
recommended by James
Stephen, and embodied in the British
Colonial Evidence Act
However, first, some final comments are needed on the New South Wales experience
after 1843.
The subsequent fate of efforts undertaken in New South Wales to enact an
Aboriginal evidence act is well documented. Without doubt,
much to James
Stephen’s dismay, an Aboriginal evidence act was not enacted in New South
Wales until 1876. While Gipps obediently
carried through on his instruction to
propose such an act to the Legislature, subsequent bills failed to pass. In
1844, the Legislative
Council ‘rejected a bill supported by Governor Gipps
on the admission of Aboriginal evidence’, and again, in 1849, ‘the
Council refused to adopt a proposed law along the lines of those already in
force in the western colonies’.
Commenting on the fate of the failed Act of 1844, Bruce Kercher notes that:
The 1844 bill was rejected by fourteen votes to ten after a vociferous
debate. The Attorney General said that one of the aims of the
bill was to reduce
the bloodshed on the frontier; he cited the lucky escape of the four Myall Creek
defendants on this ground. In
reply, Robert Lowe said that the bill would risk
the lives of white people to the uncertain consciences of
Aborigines.
Kercher also cites the infamous speech given by W C Wentworth in the
Legislature and reported in the
Sydney Herald
on 21 June 1844, in which
he showed his unrestrained hostility to Aborigines, and in which he pointed to
the execution of those convicted
of the Myall Creek killings as ‘legal
murder’ and a ‘violation of every principle of law and
justice’. Consequently,
in his account of the failure of the 1844 bill,
Kercher notes that:
The murders at Myall Creek had become a focus of the debate about law on the
frontiers of New South Wales. Each side clung to its
version of the second
trial’s outcome. The 1844 bill failed largely because the majority
believed an injustice had been done
to the murderers and because of an
irrational belief that the bill would encourage further Aboriginal attacks. The
formal legal position
was that Aborigines were British subjects, but New South
Wales was left without any means to begin to give them access to the British
version of justice. They were subjects without enforceable
III THE ENACTMENT OF ABORIGINAL EVIDENCE ACTS IN WESTERN
AUSTRALIA AND SOUTH AUSTRALIA
Why, then, were Aboriginal evidence acts passed on Western and South
Australia, and not in New South Wales? Finding an answer to this
question is
important, because it may potentially help comparative legal historians move
toward developing a more adequate ‘postcolonial’
perspective on the
application of colonial law to Indigenous
In particular, exploring this
question helps to illuminate how different relations that existed between
government officials in the
imperial centre, or ‘metropole’, and
government and judicial officials in the colonies, affected the different ways
which English criminal law was applied to Indigenous peoples – or
postcolonial ‘others’ – in nineteenth century
British settler
To my knowledge, Alex Castles is the only Australian legal historian who has
addressed this question specifically. In his discussion
of the experience of
Western and South Australia, Alex Castles remarks that:
In the cases of Western Australia and South Australia ... special legislation
was approved to deal with the admission of Aboriginal
testimony. It would seem
that in contrast to New South Wales, a change in attitude in Britain enabled
this to be done, following
a change of government in
Castles notes that in Western Australia the local enactment (Act 4 and 5 Vict
No 22, 1841) applied to both criminal and civil proceedings
and Aborigines were
permitted to give evidence by way of affirmation. A prior Act on the subject (No
8 of 1840) had been disallowed
because ‘it covered only criminal
proceedings’ and because ‘instead of giving courts a discretion as
to the weight
to be accorded to Aboriginal testimony it attempted to do this
statutorily.’ According to Castles, the Western Australia Act
of 1841 was
later re-enacted in 1843 (7 Vic No 7) and made permanent in 1849 (12 Vic No
Castles notes that ‘South
Australia succeeded in gaining approval for similar legislation in 1844’
(Ordinance No 8 of
1844, SA) but that ‘serious problems remained in
relation to the corroboration of Aboriginal testimony, along the lines raised
with respect to the New South Wales enactment of 1839’. Although the South
Australian legislation was amended in 1846 in an
attempt to overcome these
problems (Ordinance No 5 of 1846, SA) Castles claims that the amendments were
not all that satisfactory.
Castles’s general account of the enactment of legislation in Western
Australia and South Australia is for the most part
accurate, it is lacking the
detail required in order to situate the enactment of these statutes within
broader comparative context.
Specifically, it appears that Castles may have been
wrong in concluding that an Aboriginal evidence act was implemented in Western
Australia in 1841.
IV WESTERN AUSTRALIA: THE QUESTION OF THE DISALLOWANCE OF THE
ABORIGINAL EVIDENCE ACT OF 1841
The need for a comparative perspective is clearly suggested in
contemporaneous data, such as in the early despatch, dated 3 May 1839,
new Governor of Western Australia, John Hutt, sent to Lord Glenelg on subjects
which included the ‘Character of the
Aborigines’ and the need for
‘Magistrates to receive Evidence in certain
In his despatch, Hutt related
his experience of having travelled recently from England, which led him to
contemplate the ‘future
destiny’ of the local Aborigines.
Specifically, he surmised that:
To a person residing in a colony of England, among an untutored race, such as
the aborigines of Australia, the question naturally
and anxiously arises, what
is to be this people’s future destiny? Are they to be swept off by
aggression and disease, or will
they pine away under a feeling of their
immeasurable inferiority to the white men; or, if they survive, will it be to
sink into a
state little better than the slave, or gradually to be absorbed into
and become one people with their
Hutt believed that while the last of these potential outcomes (racial
amalgamation) was at least for now ‘apparently unattainable’,
the long-term ‘result which in our conduct towards them we should ever
keep in view’.
However, Hutt added
that, in addition, ‘[m]uch will depend on the way in which we exercise our
power, but still more upon the
character and disposition of the aborigines
themselves’. Moreover, in a statement that would clearly appease the
of English Evangelicals like Lord Glenelg, Hutt added:
Knowing the feeling on this point which pervades the Government and the
public mind in England, and having had it strongly pressed
upon my attention
before sailing for this country, I have since my arrival here taken every
opportunity of ascertaining the present
condition of the native inhabitants of
Western Australia, and the relative position in which they stand towards the
Like others, such as James Stephen, Jr, and the Aborigines Protection
Society, who pushed for the equal treatment of Indigenous peoples
‘British subjects’, Hutt viewed the inadmissibility of Aboriginal
testimony in courts of law to be one of the
key obstacles that made it
impossible for Aborigines ‘to participate with us in the benefit of the
leading principles of the
English constitution, perfect equality before the law,
and full protection of their lives and
liberties’.
Consequently, in his
despatch of 3 May 1839, Hutt informed Glenelg that he recognized that an
‘alteration in the law’
was needed, and that he thought that given
‘a measure of such importance’, it was ‘most advisable ... to
the draft of a Bill for your Lordship’s consideration, in order
that I may be favoured with your Lordship’s opinion as
to its propriety or
expediency.’ Hutt explained that:
The chief provisions of this Bill are to enable magistrates to issue warrants
on the statements without oath of the natives, and to
allow those statements to
be taken in evidence on the trial, and to warrant judgment being passed and
punishment inflicted on such
evidence, when borne out by circumstantial proofs,
in all cases, whether the offender be a colonist or one of the
aborigines.
Hutt further noted that:
In proposing this Bill, the draft of which I now enclose, and upon which I
solicit your Lordship’s early opinion, I would observe,
that it affects
the criminal law alone, because civil law being the offspring of civilization,
nothing relating to the aborigines
can have reference
Hutt’s detailed reasoning as to the need for this type of bill was
remarkably similar to that offered by Governor Gipps in New
South Wales,
especially in relation to the need for such a law, as much to protect settlers
from Aborigines, as to protect Aborigines
from settlers. In particular, Hutt
pointed out that in English courts of law ‘all evidence must be taken on
oath, or upon an
affirmation, declared by an Act of Parliament equivalent to an
oath’; however, ‘the aborigines of Australia have no religious
either of blessing or of cursing, by which their conscience can be
From this source the most serious evils necessarily flow. In very many
instances criminals escape altogether; in others, as I have
before observed, the
principles of the law by which we profess to be guided are violated, and putting
aside its slow forms and technicalities,
and acting only on notorious facts,
offenders in very gross cases are apprehended and summarily convicted by a
magistrate, on legally
inadmissible evidence. Whilst settlers at stations widely
distant from the seat of government, ignorant of the name and person of
native depredator, of if they know them, unable to bring the requisite proof,
having had their sheep stolen, their goods and
pigs speared, and their gardens
and fields robbed at first, a second and perhaps a third time, at last seeing
that they cannot, as
they think, obtain justice in any other way, consider
themselves authorized to defend their property by every means in their power,
and they fire upon the native when they next catch them thieving. Exasperation,
revenge and murder ensue, and eventually the weaker
exterminated.
Again revealing his own sense of the need for a comparative perspective, Hutt
made a point of further noting that:
I am not now stating what actually takes place in this colony, but rather
pointing to what has taken place elsewhere, and what we
must expect will occur
in Western Australia, unless some timely check is interposed by a change or
modification of the existing law.
Lord Russell, having replaced Lord Glenelg in the interim as Colonial
Secretary, replied to Governor Hutt in a despatch, dated 29
October 1839, in
which he stated:
I approve of the principle on which this proposed enactment is founded. It is
clearly right to enable the magistrates to take the
evidence of a native, though
not upon oath. The judge and jury will then decide what such evidence may be
worth. It will, however,
be proper to add to the Bill a clause, providing that
no sentence upon a native shall be carried into effect until the chief judge
the colony shall have had before him the evidence in the case, and shall have
confirmed the sentence.
The following year, on 19 August 1840, Governor Hutt forwarded Lord Russell a
copy of the Act (No 8) ‘to allow the Aboriginal
Natives of Western
Australia to give Information and Evidence in Criminal Cases, and to enable
Magistrates to award Summary Punishment
As noted earlier, in this
discussion of the case of Western Australia, Alex Castles argued that the Act of
1840 was disallowed because
‘it covered only criminal proceedings’
and because ‘instead of giving courts a discretion as to the weight to be
accorded to Aboriginal testimony it attempted to do this
statutorily’.
However, not cited
by Castles is the fact that the exact circumstances that led to the disallowance
of the statute are documented
in considerably more detail in the correspondence
that transpired between Governor Hutt and Lord Russell, as well as in a private
minute apparently written by Lord Russell, regarding issues and problems with
the Act of 1840. One additional factor that may have
contributed to the
legislation being disallowed was that Governor Hutt openly disagreed with and
decided not to follow Lord Russell’s
instructions on how to improve the
draft legislation he submitted in 1839. Specifically, in the explanatory
comments on the Act he
provided in his despatch of 19 August 1840, Hutt
mentioned that:
In the despatch [I received] relative to this Act, your Lordship says it will
be proper to add a clause, providing that no sentence
upon a native shall be
carried into effect until the chief judge of the colony shall have had before
him the evidence of the case,
and shall have confirmed the sentence. The Act now
submitted contains no such clause, and I have ventured, with some hesitation,
forego your Lordship’s instructions on this point, because I could not but
concur in the reasoning of the Council, when
this Act was under discussion, that
by the insertion of such a clause, this, which if sanctioned will prove a most
salutary measure,
would be rendered frequently
inoperative.
It is significant to note the considerations Governor Hutt took into account
in deciding not to follow Russell’s instructions.
In essence, Hutt
recognized that requiring all sentences handed out to Aborigines to be approved
by the chief judge of the colony
would make it impossible for magistrates to use
their summary jurisdiction to deal with the ‘common offences of the
aborigines’
in a manner that would both allow for the ‘immediate
punishment of the offender’ and at the same time reduce ‘the
exasperation of feeling which is excited’ among the local Aborigines
‘when a family is deprived of one of its members,
or a tribe of one of its
warriors, by the suffering individual being sent to a distant part of the
colony, for to them an unknown,
or at least unintelligible period’. Hutt
invoked the same rationale to explain and justify the power the Act gave to
magistrates
to impose sentences of whipping, in lieu of a sentence of
imprisonment, on any Aborigines who were convicted of offences of a
nature.’ According to Hutt, the punishment of whipping was
less oppressive to Aborigines, because:
... to the habits and dispositions of these people; they do not hold it in
that degrading, disgraceful light which we do. Parents
request it of their
children, even when those children have advanced beyond the age of childhood;
the elder for the younger members
of the community, when the latter have been
convicted of any wrong; and one and all of them would prefer the temporary pain
of flogging,
of which the worst is known and suffered at once, to a lingering
incarceration in a cell, where they are separated from their kindred,
any sympathy, and compelled to exchange the wild restless freedom to which they
have been accustomed in their native woods,
for a life of almost sedentary
inactivity.
On the back of the original hand-written copy of Hutt’s despatch of 19
August 1840 that was received by the Colonial Office,
there is a minute,
apparently written by Lord Russell, which contains a short response Hutt’s
despatch and instructions on
the action that should be taken by the Colonial
Titled ‘W Australia
714’, the minute read:
1. I agree that the necessity of requiring an oath from a native of Australia
before his evidence is an absurdity −
That absurdity ought to be removed, and not only in W Australia but
throughout the Australian colonies −
The other instructions on evidence are only good so far as they confine the
attention of the judge and jury to material points. When
any body is heard
[crossed out] called as a witness who has heard any thing of the case, as in
France, the direct testimony to important
facts, and the circumstantial hearsay
as to collateral matters form a confusion which it requires the closest and most
powerful judicial
mind to unravel −
I wish Mr. Stephen would make a draft despatch on this subject.
2. I cannot allow the aborigines to be distinguished from Europeans –
[illegible] let in this distinction, and the greatest
apprehension will grow up
– For this reason the Act should be disallowed.
In the despatch he subsequently sent to Govenor Hutt, dated 30 April 1841, in
which he gave reasons for the disallowance of the Act
of 1840, Lord Russell
referred to a number of specific problems with the Act. However, he also noted
improvements in the legislation
compared to the earlier 1839 draft, and
encouraged Governor Hutt to resubmit a revised Act for consideration by the
Colonial Office.
Specifically, on the
positive side, Lord Russell’s despatched stated that:
The Act, No 8, to allow the aboriginal natives of Western Australia to given
information and evidence in criminal cases, is not only
unobjectionable, but is
an evident improvement on the former law, so far as provision is now made for
the admission of the evidence
of aborigines without an oath. To exact oaths of
men to whom the sanctions of religion are unknown, and who do not even recognize
the elementary truths on which all religious belief must depend, is a manifest
absurdity. Either the deponent must go through what
to himself appears an
unmeaning ceremonial, and to others a profanation, or the courts must be
excluded from receiving at all the
testimony of those persons, as to matters of
fact lying within their direct personal knowledge, and which they may have no
to conceal or falsify. The escape from this dilemma is obviously to
receive their unsworn testimony, leaving the courts to make any
deduction from
the weight and credit due to the witness, which the avowed absence in his mind
of the religious sanctions for truth
may require.
However, Russell also noted that in his opinion the Act did not go far enough
in treating the testimony of Aborigines in the same
manner as that given by
white settlers. Most problematically, he pointed out:
This Act determines that the unsworn testimony of a native is never to be
regarded as conclusive, unless it be supported by strong
collaborative
circumstances. Probably, without any enactment, this rule would be observed by
every court and jury. It is, in fact,
seldom disregarded in the administration
of the law in this country. The simple assertion of a witness that a crime was
by the accused party, is, in the absence of corroborative
circumstances, inconclusive, because it is scarcely possible to suppose
absence of that kind of corroboration when the statement itself is
According to Russell, because it emphasized the need for strong corroborative
evidence, the Act did not introduce any ‘real
innovation’, but
[b]y laying down a general rule for appreciating the evidence of aborigines,
which is not extended to the evidence of other persons,
it affords an apology,
and perhaps a valid apology, for such a practical administration of the law as
may virtually exclude them
from the protection of
Russell suggested that:
To have enacted that the courts should make in each case such an abatement
from the value of the evidence as the want of an oath might
seem to the judge
and jury to require or justify, would have been the more convenient
Lord Russell also objected to the power given to magistrates to substitute
the punishment of whipping for imprisonment in the case
of more trivial
offences. The wording of Russell’s objection to this provision of the Act
is worth quoting at length, in particular
because of the manner in which it
resonates with the views long held and expressed by his top-ranking civil
servant, James Stephen,
Jr on the punishment of
and the fact that Stephen had
a great deal of input into the wording (if not the actual writing) of Lord
Russell’s official
statement on punishment of whipping inflicted on
natives. The despatch, signed by Russell, stated:
I more decidedly object to the summary jurisdiction of any two justices of
the peace, in the case of aborigines, especially connected
as it is with the
power of whipping. So great is the difficulty of legislating aright for the
protection of savage tribes living
in juxta-position with a race of civilized
men, that it is not without great hesitation that I object to any attempt made
purpose, especially when conceived, as in the present instance, in the
spirit of humanity and zeal for their welfare. Yet I must
observe, that the
delegation to justices of the peace of summary powers of punishment over the
inferior race, from which the colonists
of European descent are to be exempted,
is a measure dangerous in its tendency, as well as faulty in principle. By thus
establishing
an inequality in the eye of the law itself between the two classes,
on the express ground of national origin, we foster prejudices,
countenance to bad passions, which unfortunately need no such encouragement. It
is wise to sacrifice some immediate convenience
with a view to maintain the
general principle of strict legal equality, because, in the continued assertion
of this principle will
be found the best attainable security for maintaining
just opinions, and a correct moral sentiment throughout society at large, on
subject of the rights of the native
population.
As referred to briefly in Alex Castles’s account of the fate of the
Western Australian Act of 1840, Lord Russell added that:
I observe, also, that the admissibility of the evidence of the natives
without oath, having been expressly enacted in reference to
criminal cases, the
consequence inevitably follows, that, in all civil suits, their testimony must
be entirely rejected. Whether
this was an intentional or an unforeseen
consequence of the law, does not appear; but whatever the fact may in that
respect be, it
is a result to be deprecated. The evidence which is admitted
where liberty and life are at stake, should not be excluded when proprietary
interests only are in question.
Finally, Russell advised that:
For these reasons I have thought it my duty to advise Her Majesty to disallow
this Act also, and the Queen has been pleased to disallow
it accordingly. But
you will immediately propose to the local Legislature the enactment of another
law, having for its object to
dispense with an oath in receiving the evidence of
any aboriginal inhabitants of the province who may be unable to appreciate the
nature and the obligation of an oath, qualifying the rule by such general terms
as I have mentioned.
On 20 January 1842, Governor Hutt submitted a revised Act (No 22, 4&5
Vict, 1841) for approval by the Colonial Office. Although
Hutt said he disagreed
with Lord Russell’s views on the use of whipping as a substitute for
imprisonment for Aborigines, he
nevertheless followed all of Lord
Russell’s recommendations with regard to revising the Act. Specifically,
Hutt noted:
Your Lordship’s observations and instructions have, in the reframing of
this Act, been strictly attended to, and literally followed
out. The evidence of
the aborigines is hereby admitted without distinction, whether in civil or
criminal cases, whilst it is left
to the court to decide the value to be
attached to such testimony; and the summary jurisdiction over aboriginal
offenders, given
to magistrates under the disallowed Bill, is not only separated
from the present Act, but is done away with
altogether.
Likely much to Hutt’s surprise, given the diligent effort he made to
follow Lord Russell’s precise instructions, their
correspondence of the
time indicates that the proposed Western Australian Act of 1841 was also
disallowed in London. In his reply
to Hutt informing him of the disallowance,
dated 15 February 1843, Lord Russell stated:
I have laid before the Queen the Act which accompanied your despatch, No 2,
of the 20th January 1842, passed by the Legislative Council
Australia, on the 26th of October 1841, intituled [sic], ‘An Act to allow
the Aboriginal Natives of Western Australia
to give Information and Evidence
without the sanction of an Oath.’
I transmit to you copies of a reference to the law officers of the Crown, and
of their report on this Act. In consequence of the objections
stated by them to
this Act, I have thought it my duty to advise the Queen to disallow it; and have
received Her Majesty’s commands
to signify to you, that Her Majesty has
been pleased to disallow it accordingly.
It is not without regret that I announce to you this decision; and I am so
fully sensible of the importance of the subject, that I
shall consider whether
it may not be advisable to introduce into Parliament a Bill to enable Colonial
Legislatures to pass laws authorising
the admission of the testimony of natives,
although unsworn, in civil and in criminal cases, under such restriction as may
Although a copy of the reference to the law officers of the Crown referred to
by Lord Russell in his despatch of 15 February 1843,
is not included in the
Papers Relating to Emigration and the Aboriginal Population and
other Affairs in Australia
(from 1839-1844), the Public Record Office files
for New South Wales contain a letter from the law officers of the Crown, T
and W W Pollett to Lord Stanley, dated 26 October 1842, which explains
how and why the Western Australian Act of 1841 was disallowed.
Interestingly,
this document also shows the nature of James Stephen, Jr’s involvement as
a civil servant assigned to carry
out a task he probably knew would probably
have an unfavourable result. In their letter, the law officers informed Lord
Stanley that:
On the 9th [?] instant we had the honor to receive a letter from Mr Stephen
wherein he stated he had been directed by Your Lordship
to transmit to us a copy
of an Act proposed by the Legislature of Western Australia on the 26 November
1841 entitled ‘An Act
to allow the Aboriginal natives of Western Australia
to given information and evidence without the sanction of an oath.’
Mr Stephen enclosed an extract of so much of the Despatch of Governor Hutt as
explaining the intention of the Act. In Mr Stephen’s
letter it was also
stated that in the year 1839 an Act was passed by the Legislature of New South
Wales ‘to allow the Aboriginal
natives of New South Wales to be received
as competent witnesses in criminal cases’. A copy of that Act for our
information
was enclosed, together with a copy of a report upon it which was
made by Sr J Campbell and Sir I Wilde when filling the Offices of
Attorney and
Solicitor General. And Mr Stephen was further pleased to state that he had
received Your Lordship’s directions
to request that we would take into
consideration this Act of the government of Western Australia and report to your
Lordship our
opinion whether the objections where were pointed out by the late
Attorney and Solicitor General as rendering necessary the disallowance
form Act apply to the present Act, and would prevent its being properly
submitted for Her Majesty’s confirmation.
In obedience to your Lordships’ Commands signified to us as above we
have taken this matter into our consideration, and have
the honour to report for
your Lordships’ information that the objections which were pointed out by
the late Attorney and Solicitor
General to the former Act are applicable to the
present − the two Acts are in fact, as far as regards the nature of these
objections,
substantially the same.
There is also more direct evidence that James Stephen Jr, was intimately
involved in the dispute over the enactment of an Aboriginal
evidence act in
Western Australia. On 28 September 1842, Stephen wrote a lengthy minute to Lord
Stanley, in response to his request
for Stephen’s opinion on the
‘Crown lawyers’ legal opinion that the Aboriginal evidence act
proposed for Western
Australia should be disallowed because its provisions were
‘contrary to the principles of British jurisprudence’. Lord
I do not know how far you might consider that objection to be applicable to
the provisions of the Act of the Government of Western
Australia, but I enclose
a copy of the report that you may have an opportunity of referring to it,
together with the Act on which
that report was
In reply, James Stephen, Jr, wrote:
I apprehend that the opinion of the late Attorney and Solicitor General
(suffering it to be sound) will require the disallowance of
the Act about
evidence. I must acknowledge that I do not understand it. They argue that the
admission, as a witness, of a man who
is an Atheist, not by willful but by
inevitable ignorance is contrary to the principles of British Jurisprudence.
Under the shelter
of emphatic language of this kind much often [papers] current,
which has not real or precise meaning. I suppose the great principle
Jurisprudence is that of making the best Laws with the exigencies of Society may
require and the state of Society may
admit. If the admission of the evidence of
such people be requisite to the general good I confess I do not know what can be
the principle
of Jurisprudence which sh’d prevent such an Enactment. It is
not opposed to the Divine Law, not to any of the Franchises which
regard as their birth-right. The real utility of oaths and the real good sense
of refusing to listen to the testimony
of Atheists are a large chapter, on
which, of course, I do not mean to enter. But whatever may be the sound opinion
in reference
to this Country, and to those of our fellow-Country-men who may
profess Atheistically opinions, I cannot doubt that the interests
of truth and
justice [will] be best promoted by setting aside this prohibitory rule in a
Country where Atheism is a mere calamity
and does not indicate the influence of
a corrupt will in darkening the understanding.
However, the practical question is, whether your Lordship will regard the
opinion of Sir John Campbell and Sir Tho Wilde as justifying
the disallowance of
this Ordinance?
I am afraid that in the law of this opinion it will be impossible to allow
the Act; however it is an opinion, as I understand it,
not as to the policy, but
as to the competency of the Colonial Legislatures to pass such an Act. But I
think the expediency of admitting
the testimony of Aborigines, valued quantum,
so strong, that I should wish the opinion of the [learned] Law Officers to be
and should they concur with this [proposition], I am inclined to advise
the introduction of a short Act of Parliament expressly authorizing
Australian Legislatures to pass enactments on this
Thus it would appear that the Western Australian Act of 1841 was disallowed
for exactly the same reason as the New South Wales Act
of 1839; both were
considered by law officers of the Crown to be ‘repugnant to the laws of
England’, and ‘contrary
to the principles of British
jurisprudence’. In order to get around this otherwise insurmountable
obstacle to the enactment
of local colonial Aboriginal evidence bills, officials
in the Colonial Office, including James Stephen, Jr, saw no other way than
have the British Parliament pass an act that would, in effect, give prior
statutory approval to the enactment of such legislation.
Thus, on 4 July 1843,
Lord Stanley wrote to Governor Hutt, informing him:
In my despatch, No 5 of the 15th February last, I intimated to you that it
might probably be considered advisable to introduce into
Parliament a Bill to
enable colonial Legislatures to pass laws authorizing the admission of the
testimony of natives, although unsworn,
in civil and criminal cases, with such
restrictions as might be thought necessary.
I now transmit to you a copy of an Act which has been passed for that object.
The purposes of this Act have already been so fully
discussed in previous
correspondence that it is not necessary for me to trouble you with any further
explanations on the subject.
I have, therefore, only to request that you will
take an early opportunity of proposing to the Legislative Council of your
an enactment in accordance with the provisions of the Act of
Parliament.
V SOUTH AUSTRALIA: THE SENSIBILITIES OF HINDMARSH, GAWLER,
The, albeit, thus far preliminary, research I have carried out on the South
Australian experience indicates that the colonial politics
and circumstances
surrounding the enactment of an Aboriginal evidence act in 1844 were different
from those that prevailed in either
New South Wales or Western Australia. At the
same time, my research findings show that the imperial influences, including the
of British missionary evangelism, the Aborigines Protection Society,
and James Stephen, Jr, were much the
The background events to the
enactment of the South Australian Act of 1844 span the period covering the
governorship of the first
three governors of South Australia, John Hindmarsh,
George Gawler, and Sir George Grey. Evidence suggests that John Hindmarsh came
to the new colony with clear instructions to treat local natives as if they were
British subjects who were fully amenable to English
law. However, Governor
Gawler obviously abandoned this ideal soon after he became governor, when he
gave the order to Major O’Halloran
to ‘enforce summary justice
without trial’ against the natives who were thought to be responsible for
massacre’ of June
In the end, the person who took
the lead in enacting an Aboriginal evidence act for South Australia was Sir
George Grey, a well-known
Anglican evangelical and zealous advocate for
civilizing natives, who would, coincidentally, later serve terms as the governor
New Zealand and the Cape Colony.
In their book,
Fatal Collisions: Myths of the South Australian Frontier
and the Violence of Memory
, Robert Foster, Rick Hosking and Amanda
Nettlebeck note that the South Australia Act, which was passed in 1834,
‘made no mention
of the Indigenous inhabitants and declared the region
“waste and unoccupied”’. However, they add that:
Shortly after the passage of the South Australia Act in 1834, a Whig
government under Lord Melbourne came to power and the colonial
office was now
dominated by humanitarians. Men such as Lord Glenelg, Sir George Grey and James
Stephen, who had been active campaigners
against slavery, now expressed their
concerns about the rights of Indigenous
Moreover, Foster, Hoskings and Nettlebeck could have added that it was
because of the influence of the Colonial Office, and the epiphany
experienced by
men like James Stephen partly because of the lobbying efforts of the Aborigines
Protection Society,
that Captain
Hindmarsh was instructed to make the legal rights of Aboriginal people
‘the centrepiece of his Proclamation speech
Hindmarsh’s
Proclamation stated in part that it was his intention:
[T]o take every lawful means for extending the same protection to the Native
Populations as to the rest of His Majesty’s Subjects,
and of my firm
determination to punish with exemplary severity, all acts of violence and
injustice which may in any manner be practised
or attempted against the Natives,
who are to be considered as much under the safeguard of the law as the Colonists
themselves and
equally entitled to the privileges of British
Although not touched on by Foster, Hoskings and Nettlebeck, there is also
evidence that Governor Hindmarsh took the initiative to
propose an Aboriginal
evidence act for South Australia as early as 1838. Interestingly also, from a
comparative perspective, it appears
that the intention behind Hindmarsh’s
proposal for a South Australian act, was similar to that expressed by Governor
in New South Wales; in that both stated that they were concerned as much
with increasing the chances of successfully prosecuting
Aborigines who committed
crimes against white settlers and other Aborigines, as they were concerned about
protecting Aborigines from
the violent depredations committed against them by
whites. On 16 March 1838, Governor Hindmarsh wrote a despatch (No 80) to Lord
Glenelg in which he reported the case of a murder of a white settler by
Aborigines. Hindmarsh told Glenelg that he had ‘no
doubt’ that the
murder ‘was in revenge for the fact of several of their boys having been
killed by the Colonists’,
and that he believed ‘the natives
generally, were not concerned in the murder; but that its perpetration was
confined to one
individuals’.
Hindmarsh went on to
say that he ‘had much difficulty in allaying the fears of the white
population, which [the murder and
other attacks by Aborigines against whites]
had led them into the mistaken opinion that retaliation was justifiable and even
necessary’,
and that he was strongly determined ‘not to suffer any
but the culprits to be molested, and also to punish with the utmost
aggression whether committed by Black or White’. In addition to
intervening personally to prevent the escalation
of violence between Aborigines
and white settlers, Hindmarsh reported that another method he adopted to allay
the fears of white
settlers was to appoint ‘a Committee of twelve
[settlers] to examine into all causes of differences which may arise between
Aborigines and the Colonists, who are to suggest to me from time to time such
remedies and regulations as may appear to be necessary’.
In the conclusion
to his despatch, Hindmarsh outlined more specifically his views on the causes of
the violent encounters between
Aborigines and colonists, and the steps he
planned to take to ensure both were treated equally in the eyes of the law. He
notwithstanding what he occurred he felt confident that the Aborigines
‘will never be the aggressors in any collision that
may unfortunately take
place’. He was convinced that ‘should such a misfortune occur, it
will arise from drunkenness,
other improper conduct, or from the no less
degrading absurd fears on the part of the Colonists’. Moreover, Hindmarsh
Lord Glenelg that he could rely on his ‘most earnest exertions
and caution to prevent such a
With regard to how he
planned to deal with the recent case of the murder of a white settler by
Aborigines, Hindmarsh advised Glenelg
Should the murderers be apprehended we have only the evidence of a Native
Boy, who stated that he saw the persons accused standing
over the body; it will
be curious to hear the advice the Committee may tender to me respecting the
validity of this evidence, on
which indeed the Law Officers and myself entertain
considerable doubts.
I avail myself of this occasion to inform Your Lordship that I have for some
time seriously considered the necessity of legalizing
the evidence of the
Aborigines, for which purpose I intend to propose a Bill to the Council, but
which according to my present view
must receive Her Majesty’s approbation
before being carried into effect.
I have been unable to find any evidence that Governor Hindmarsh ever brought
forth an actual Aboriginal evidence bill for South Australia.
By the middle of
1840, Governor Hindmarsh had been replaced by Governor Gawler. As several
previous researchers have shown, Gawler
soon found himself embroiled in a heated
debate in South Australia over whether Aborigines should be viewed as
‘British subjects’
and dealt with according to the strict principles
and rules of English law when they committed crimes of violence against white
A more detailed study of the
debate over the legal status of Aborigines in South Australia after 1839 would
no doubt help to enrich
our legal-historical knowledge of this important
However, the focus of this
study is restricted to documenting, more narrowly what was said in the course of
this debate, about the
issue of the admissibility of Aboriginal evidence in
criminal trials.
On 17 September 1840, the
South Australian Gazette
published the
‘Journal of the Proceedings of the Council’ held in Adelaide on 15
September 1840 at which Governor Gawler
reported on the action taken against by
Major O’Halloran against the Aborigines who allegedly massacred the 26
survivors of
. At this meeting of the Legislative Council,
Governor Gawler reported that:
On the 12th of August last I laid before a Council specifically assembled for
the purpose, the reports which had been forwarded to
me concerning the murder of
several Europeans by the natives near the coast to the south-east of Encounter
Bay. His Honor the Judge
[Chief Justice Cooper] who attended by particular
request, and all the members present, including the Advocate General, declared
their opinions that the crimes in question were beyond the reach of the ordinary
British law.
While not a lawyer himself, Gawler stated, with apparent confidence in his
own opinion, that he himself was certain that this would
be the conclusion
reached even ‘before these opinions were elicited’. Gawler reasoned
that this had to be the case, ‘inasmuch
as, in addition to other forcible
reasons, it is necessarily impossible, by ordinary law, to convict men of crimes
of the perpetration
of which no evidence commonly recognised as legal can be
procured’. With regard to problems concerning the testimony of natives,
further put forth that:
The natives, as being practical atheists unacquainted with the obligation of
an oath or solemn declaration, are not in British law
valid witnesses. I am
informed by His Honor the Judge that a legislative enactment has been passed in
New South Wales under which
their evidence is received as far as is may be
corroborated by the testimony of competent Europeans; but even had such an
been in force here, it would, in the case in question, have been
unavailing, inasmuch as all the Europeans at the time present in
the district
having been killed, there remained no legal evidence of any kind, direct or
corroborative.
Gawler went on to use this argument to justify his recent resort to martial
law. Specifically, he reasoned that since the Maria massacre
‘[b]eyond the limits of ordinary British justice, there remained for me,
in conformity with usage in Great Britain,
the course of considering the
district in question as in a disturbed state, and of proceeding on the
principles of martial law’.
Gawler claimed that he would ‘have been
gratified if there had been no infliction of punishment except after formal
in the ordinary mode of British executions’, since he also
realized that:
Punishment without trial by promiscuous firing is repugnant to justice and
humanity – is calculated to excite the passions of
the natives and to
array them in open hostility. Punishment, after trial, in the deliberate and
awful form of British justice, will,
I am persuaded, as in a former case it has
already been done, commend itself even to their understandings, and repress in a
powerful manner their disposition to
Three days following his meeting with the Legislative Council, on 15 August
1840, Governor Gawler wrote a despatch (No 12) to Lord
Russell, informing him of
the massacre of the survivors of the
, and the order he gave to
execute two of the Aborigines relying on practices of martial law and summary
On the back of this despatch is
a long hand-written minute pencilled by James Stephen, Jr to another Colonial
Office official, Mr
Vernon Smith, dated 19 February 1841, in which he outlined
his serious objections to Chief Justice Cooper’s opinion of the
status of Aborigines and Governor Gawler’s use of summary justice. In
Stephen’s opinion:
The Governor being informed by the Chief Justice that he (the CJ) had no
authority to try the Aborigines accused of a massacre of
many Europeans, sent
out a party of Police with orders to ‘execute summary justice after
deliberate and formal investigation’
– that is as I understand to
put the offenders to death without trial. This appears to me a most unfortunate
and an indefensible
proceeding. The Governor appears to have inferred that if he
had not a Civil, he must have a Belligerent authority over these people.
not think that the inference was just. It did not follow that because he could
not try he might slay them. He might have had
a Law enacted to provide for their
trial if the Law did not already authorize such a trial. But I further think
that the Chief Justice
was in error, & that the murderers might have been
tried. Such trials have repeatedly taken place in W. Australia. The mail
brings a report of such a trial in N.S. Wales. The Aborigines, whether
subjects of the Queen or not, are persons living on British
territory, &
within the jurisdiction of British Courts. That they are savages cannot entitle
them to impunity, still less expose
them to be punished without trial. I
apprehend however that the question of Law must be referred to the Law Officers.
But I would
further suggest, that instead of the approbation which he asks,
Colonel Gawler’s order must be distinctly & strongly
disapproved.
In a subsequent minute to Vernon Smith, dated 12 March 1841, found on the
back of a follow-up despatch that Governor Gawler sent to
Lord Russell in
early-September 1840 with further information on the summary trial and execution
of the two natives, James Stephen
This is the conclusion of the Gov’s report of the ‘summary
punishment’ of the Aborigines. Whatever may be the moral
justification of
such proceedings I cannot, but think, that most men will regard them as
altogether indefensible...
I have always thought that the Law Officer, or rather the Judge of South
Australia gave an erroneous opinion on this subject. I endeavoured
this shortly in the note of 19th Feb on the back of No 348. There can be no
doubt that the murder was committed within
the local jurisdiction of British
Court [sic]. The Judge suggested a difficulty which appears to me to be really
of no value at all.
It has within my own memory been unheeded in cases exactly
parallel in Guiana, in Western Australia, in New South Wales, and I think
Cape of Good Hope. Lord John Russell’s Minute of the 20th Feb directed a
reference to the Law Officers of the Crown.
That direction appears to have been
countermanded by his Lordship’s letter of 22nd Feb, and the reference to
the Crown lawyers
has therefore not been made. I must venture to repeat my
former opinion that it is the right course of
proceeding.
As if he had not already said enough on this subject, Stephen subsequently
wrote another minute on the back a despatch Gawler sent
to Lord Russell in the
final month of his tenure as Governor of South Australia, in which Gawler had
continued his effort to justify
the summary execution of the two natives for the
Maria massacre. Stephen added specifically that:
As a matter of Law there can be not doubt that the proceedings of Colonel
Gawler and the Officers employed by him must be designated
by the word murder,
however injurious the use of such a word may be to characterize what they did.
Such at least was the opinion
of Sir John Campbell and Sir Thomas Wilde. Colonel
Gawler undoubtedly being misled by the opinion of the Chief Justice of the
The Protector argues that it would be unjust to subject the Aborigines
to the liabilities of English law; and infers I know not how
that they ought not
to have the protection of it. I should entirely admit the premises and deny the
Conclusion.
In the end, the Crown Law Officers substantially agreed with James Stephen in
this regard, as revealed in the legal opinion they submitted
to Lord Russell on
27 March 1841, in which they stated that the execution of the alleged native
murderers in South Australia was
‘contrary to law’, and that Major
O’Halloran and Governor Gawler could possibly be found guilty of murder
summary execution of the natives: ‘Major O’Halloran and
those who were present assisting him being guilty as principles
Gawler being guilty as an accessory before the
It is remarkable, and somewhat surprising at first notice, to find that
within month after writing his final report to the Colonial
Office on the
‘summary punishment’ of natives for the
Governor Gawler expressed his intention of bringing a bill before the
Legislative Council of South Australia to allow ‘aboriginal
to be received as competent witnesses in criminal cases. As reported in the
South Australian Gazette
on 1 October 1840, at the meeting of the Council
held on September 30, Governor Gawler introduced ‘a bill to allow the
natives of Australia, Van Diemen’s Land, and New Zealand, to be
received as competent witnesses in criminal cases in the province
Australia’. In the ‘Minute on the subject of Legislation for the
Aborigines, read by the Governor in Council,
on the 30th September, 1840’,
Gawler stated:
I have to request the attention of the Legislative Council to the important
and interesting subject of Legislation for the Aborigines.
Their proper position
in the eye of the law has hitherto been a question of the greatest difficulty
throughout the whole continent
of Australia.
Valuing highly the British constitution, and considering it in its purity as
forming at the same time the bulwark of the Government
and the safeguard of the
people, intelligent men throughout the empire have been most anxious that its
benefits should be enjoyed
by every inhabitant of British territory, from its
parent and central seat in Britain to the furthest limits of the empire, to the
uttermost end of the earth – the continent of Australia.
Despite the lip-service he gave to acknowledging the influence of British
Evangelicals, Gawler’s intent was less benevolent
that it might appear at
first glance. Indeed, any initial surprise about why Governor Gawler would
decide to introduce an Aboriginal
evidence act, is diminished considerably upon
reading his candid statement to the Legislative Council that he believed that
legislation would have provided a more effective legal tool for prosecuting
the Aborigines responsible for the
massacre. According to Gawler:
‘The circumstances of the [Maria] murders, and the names and persons of
the murderers, who were
in considerable numbers, were perfectly well
known’, and ‘[m]embers of their own tribe could have been easily
to describe them intelligibly to full ordinary satisfaction’.
Notwithstanding this however, because of the inadmissibility
of Aboriginal
evidence, had the culprits been given a regular trial, he had ‘reason to
believe, with correct constitutional
accuracy, that these murderers’ would
have been ‘beyond the reach of British law’. Consequently, he stated
The introduction of a bill which I now lay on the table for the admission as
far as practicable of the evidence of the aborigines
in the courts of law, added
to the discussion which has arisen in the community upon the proceedings which
the Government thought
it necessary to adopt in connection with the passengers
of the Maria, have led me to enter at considerable length into this
South Australian Gazette
(No 142) 8 October 1840, contained an
erratum noting that, because of an oversight by the printers, a paragraph was
omitted from
the Governor’s minute of Council published the previous week,
which read:
I now lay the bill before you with no further remark than that as being in
its object of admitting the evidence of persons inconscious
[sic] of the
obligation of an oath or solemn declaration, a very great departure from
constitutional principles. I apprehend it may
be necessary to suspend its
operation until it shall have received the Royal
I have found no evidence that Gawler’s bill was either examined or
approved by the Colonial Office or the Crown Law Officers
in London. It is
likely that even if the bill had been forwarded to London, it would not have
been sent out for a legal opinion,
since it had already been decided by this
time that Gawler would be recalled. According to Foster, Hosking and
Nettlebeck:
Gawler’s recall to London because of his government’s
over-expenditure was probably decided [even] before the news [of
massacre] reached the Colonial Office, but his action of the
massacre was thought by many in the colony to be the essential
cause of his replacement by George Grey the following
Foster, Hosking and Nettlebeck note that Sir George Grey’s approach to
dealing with the ongoing collisions between Aborigines
and colonists differed
fundamentally from the approach taken by Gawler.
Whereas Governor Gawler’s response to the
massacre had
been underpinned by the belief that quick punitive actions, even if beyond the
exact letter of the law, produced the
best resolution to frontier violence,
Grey’s response to the current crisis was more wary and equivocal. For a
start, he expressed
suspicion about the colonists’ suggestion that the
police should be regarded as a security force to protect the interests and
risk-bound enterprises of overlanders, as well as that non-uniformed volunteers
with undeclared designs should move against the Indigenous
population. He also
doubted that the attacks on overlanders were
unprovoked.
It is clear that James Stephen had a direct influence on Governor
Grey’s thinking and actions on the legal status that should
be granted to
Aborigines in the criminal courts of South Australia. This influence is most
clearly illustrated in a despatch addressed
to Governor Grey that James Stephen
wrote for Lord Stanley’s signature in December 1841, in which Grey was
informed of the
Crown Law Officers legal opinion that the ‘summary
justice’ meted out by Governor Gawler and Major O’Hallaron was
‘contrary to law’ and of ‘the legal character of
In this despatch, Lord
Stanley also felt it was his duty ‘to state unreservedly, that Her
M’s Government most strongly
object to the course pursued on the occasion
referred to’ and that he ‘was glad to perceive, that in the
proceedings
which form the subject of your Despatches Nos 3 and 5 of the 29 and
31st of May you enforced principles more consonant with those
entertained by the
Government and with the Law as laid down by the Law Officers of the
Thus, it is not coincidental that Governor Grey also expressed concern over
the inadmissibility of Aboriginal evidence in criminal
trials, and eventually
acted upon the instructions he received from the Colonial Office to enact an
Aboriginal evidence bill for
South Australia. On 5 July 1843, Lord Stanley sent
Governor Grey a near exact copy of the despatch sent to other governors of the
Australian colonies, informing of them of the Act passed in Parliament to enable
colonies to enact local Aboriginal evidence ordinances,
and instructing that
they ‘should forthwith propose to the Council of your Government the
enactment of a Law in accordance
with the provisions of the Act of
Parliament’.
Governor Grey acted
on these instructions in August 1844, when, in his opening address to the
Legislative Council on August 5, he
said that he would be introducing ‘a
variety of legislative measures which appear to me to be calculated to promote
the prosperity
and well being of the various classes of Her Majesty’s
subjects in this Province’.
Specifically, Grey informed that Legislative Council that:
An Act having been passed by the Imperial Parliament, which gives to the
Colonial Legislatures the authority requisite to enable them
to pass laws for
the admission in certain cases of unsworn testimony in civil and criminal
proceedings, it is my intention to introduce
into the Council an Ordinance to
allow the aboriginal inhabitants of South Australia to given information and
evidence without the
sanction of an oath; and I would earnestly recommend to
your attention the necessity which exists for endeavouring to provide some
remedy for the disabilities under which the aboriginal inhabitants of the
province at present labour, form the frequent inapplicability
of many of the
provisions of the English law to cases which they are concerned.
Expressing further the Evangelical missionary zeal he shared with other
humanitarians, like James Stephen, Jr, who dedicated themselves
to the cause of
‘civilizing’ and ‘protecting’ Indigenous peoples
throughout Her Majesty’s growing British
Empire, Governor Grey went on to
state that:
One of the most distinguishing features of modern colonization is the anxiety
manifested by the immigrants to render their occupation
of the ancient territory
of the aborigines productive of the blessings of Christianity and civilization
to the people whose country
they enter, and the settlers in this colony have
ever lent the government a zealous aid in the promotion of any plans having for
their object the civilization and welfare of the native population.
It is obviously one of the most important duties of the Legislature of a
country circumstanced as this is, to promote this feeling
by every means in
their power, and to endeavour to induce each member of the community to perform,
within the sphere of his individual
influence, those duties towards the
aborigines, for the fulfilment of which he rendered himself morally responsible
when he entered
the territory. No prouder or brighter distinction could adorn
the history of South Australia, than the fact of its first European
bequeathing to their children a territory unsullied by deeds of violence and
crime; and I rely upon your bestowing the
most careful consideration upon the
measures I am about to introduce into the Council, with the object of giving
increased means
of ameliorating the condition of the aborigines, both to the
Government and to the settlers, upon whose Christian and benevolent
towards them, the welfare and happiness of the scattered and wandering native
population must mainly depend.
On 14 August 1844, Governor Grey transmitted a copy of Ordinance (No. 8)
passed by the Legislative Council of South
and on 30 January 1845, Lord
Stanley replied, stating that he had ‘received the Queen’s command
to acquaint you that
Her Majesty has been pleased to confirm and allow the
ordinance’.
Although this
ordinance did by no means entirely clarify the legal status of Aborigines in the
courts of South Australia, as reflected
in part in the subsequent amendments
made to the colony’s Aboriginal evidence ordinance in 1846, 1848, and
it did reveal a great deal about
the motives and sensibilities of those who pushed for its
VI CONCLUSIONS
Surprisingly little attention has been given by Australian and comparative
common law legal historians to documenting the fate of
different early colonial
Australian Aboriginal evidence acts. While the work of writers like Alex Castles
and Bruce Kercher is foundational,
only cursory attention is given in their work
to explaining the different outcomes of the attempts made to introduce
legislation
in New South Wales, Western Australia, and South Australia. While
such ‘micro-level’, mainly individual-state focused
studies, appear
to be lacking a much needed comparative perspective, more recent
‘macro-level’ comparative studies, like
those of Jane Samson and
Lauren Benton, appear to lack the amount and type of documentation required in
order to more strongly back
up their key arguments. While Jane Samson is no
doubt correct in pointing out the important role played by the Aborigines
Society in bringing the issue of the Aboriginal evidence to the
attention of the Colonial Office, her work does not document the
significant
correspondence on this issue that transpired directly between the Colonial
Office and colonial authorities in the different
Australian colonies of the
Lauren Benton’s recent study similarly appears to be lacking needed
historical detail. Other than noting (as many other historians
Aborigines in New South Wales (and elsewhere in Australia) were denied rights to
property because of the courts’
growing support for the doctrine of
terra nullius
, Benton does not clearly outline how Aborigines continued
to be systematically excluded as legal actors after the 1830s. On the contrary,
much of her evidence, especially relating to the increasing appearance of
Aborigines in criminal court proceedings, points in the
opposite direction of
the courts treating Aborigines as full legal actors for criminal trial purposes,
except for their inability
to provide direct testimony in court; a point which
Benton curiously does not mention at all in her analysis. A possible weakness
Benton’s study is that she chose either the wrong jurisdictions, or too
few jurisdictions, to include in an adequate comparative
study of the treatment
of Indigenous peoples in British colonial legal cultures. In any case, Benton
also fails to closely address
the question of why the experience of New South
Wales was different than that of Western Australia and South Australia.
The current study has attempted to illustrate the benefits of undertaking a
program of more close archival-based research on British
colonial law
administration with respect to Indigenous peoples in the mid-nineteenth century.
Most importantly, it has illustrated
the need for undertaking a detailed
analysis of documents relating to the experience that each British colony under
investigation
had in dealing with the Colonial Office; or with what
post-colonial writers refer to as the ‘colony/metropole’
It has also shown the value of
investigating and attempting to explain the often striking parallels, as well as
frequent differences,
in the legal-historical experiences of nineteenth century
British settler colonies such as the Australian colonies, New Zealand,
Colony, and western and central Canada (in addition to other comparable British
settler societies or ‘outposts’
of nineteenth century British
imperialism). Australia offers one of many possible fascinating historical
laboratories for the study
of comparative common law legal history. More of this
be made about the nature and direction of changes that affected the way in which
Indigenous peoples were treated in the legal
systems of evolving colonial common
law jurisdictions in the nineteenth century.

R v Congo Jack Murrell
the court (consisting of Chief Justice Forbes and Justices Dowling and Burton)
decided that Aborigines were fully responsible
for their crimes under English
law, even if the crime was committed against another Aborigine. Sidney Harring
cites this case as
an example of the fact that Australian courts acted more
independently than Upper Canadian courts in setting precedents on how to
with Aborigines accused of criminal offences. Sidney L Harring,
Man’s Law: Native People in Nineteenth-Century Canadian Jurisprudence
(1998) 348 note 27. In his discussion of this case, Bruce Kercher, above n 5,
9-11, notes that the court clearly rejected barrister
Sydney Stephen’s
argument that the Aborigines had their own laws and that they ‘were given
no protection by European
law’ partly because ‘they were unable to
given evidence as witnesses’. Although, ‘(u)ltimately, Murrell was
found not guilty on the facts ... he had been declared subject to British
law’. Moreover, Kercher notes that while in the 1841
, Justice John Willis refused to follow the
precedent, and
instead argued – in agreement with the view expressed earlier by the
former Attorney General of New South Wales,
Saxe Bannister – that the
Aborigines had their own law and that the British courts should be directed to
observe it, Chief
Justice Dowling ‘subsequently said that Willis was wrong
to doubt whether an Aborigine could be tried for killing another Aborigine,

South Wales did give serious consideration to the
possibility of giving some
form of recognition to the “law” of the Aborigines’. See also,

(likely written by) Lord John Russell, 23 April 1840.
On 30 April 1840, Stephen forwarded the
New South Wales Aboriginal
to the Attorney
and Solicitor General, with a covering letter which stated: ‘I am directed
by Lord John Russell to transmit
to you herewith the copy of a Despatch from the
Governor of New South Wales submitting for the Royal allowance an Act passed by
Legislative Councils “To allow the aboriginal natives of New South
Wales to be received as competent witnesses in criminal
cases.” You will
observe that the clause preventing the Act from coming into operation until Her
Majesty’s pleasure should
be known was added at the request of the Chief
Justice who would otherwise have objected to the Act as being repugnant to the
of England ... I am to request that you will in conjunction with the
Solicitor General report to Lord John Russell your opinion whether
this Act can
properly be submitted to the Queen for confirmation.’ Signed, James
Stephen. PRO, CO 202/42, Letters from the

distinguish it clearly from local Aboriginal evidence bills; and also to remain
consistent with Jane
Samson’s reference to it in ‘British Voices and

Castles, above n 5, 534. Within this
context, it is important to note that prior to 1843, the Legislative Council of
New South Wales
was nominated by the Governor, while after 1843 it was partially
elected. See Shaw, ‘British Policy Towards the Australian
Aborigines,
1830-1850’ above n 12, 279.
In his earlier book, Reece, above n 12,
181-182, cites Robert Lowe’s speech at length, as it was originally
recorded in
The Sydney Morning Herald
, 20 June 1844, in which he stated:
‘We could not pretend to much knowledge of the character of the
aborigines; but believing
them ... a race of untutored savages, he must protest
against leaving evidence so questionable to a jury at all. Only picture their
examination. See the wild savage of the woods standing amid the hum and press of
civilised men: among them, but not of them. See
the trembling prisoner in vain
endeavouring to gather his future fate from the stolid apathy or malignant scowl
of those scarce human
lineaments. Here his evidence given through an
interpreter, in a language ... which ... is destitute of abstract ideas, and of
nicely defined terms which distinguish the almost imperceptible limits of
guilt and misfortune. See him become at once the supreme
arbiter of life and
death: a life of whose end and author he is alike ignorant, a death of whose
fearful secrets he knows nothing
– see him ready, from savage waywardness,
from puerile petulance, or from a bribe so paltry that the meanest wretch
perjured himself for hire would spurn with contempt and disgust such a
crime for such a price – see him ready to trample on
a being of whose
unspeakable importance to accountable agents he has never heard, and by false
witness to hurry a fellow-creature
into the presence of that God whose very name
is a stranger to his language – see him, finally, after the last act of
the tragedy
is over, standing on the steps of the court, and, with his national
talent for mimicry, representing to the admiring crowd the verdict
foreman, the sentence of the judge, and the thrilling appeal of the prisoner for
mercy: see all this, and then turn from the
sickening mockery, and say,
is the Majesty of British Justice!
’ Reece (n 24, 181) notes that
Robert Lowe ‘was probably the most influential opponent of the 1844
Evidence Bill and spoke
against similar legislation again in 1849’.
Kercher, above n 5, 16-17. More
recently, in his introduction to the Myall Creek massacre trials of
Kilmeister (No 1 and No 2)
of 1838, Kercher notes: ‘The hanging of
seven white men for the Myall Creek massacre of a large group of Aborigines
a huge uproar in the colony. The emotional response is still evident in
the Australian community, as was shown in the recent unveiling
of memorials to
the victims. Myall Creek should be central to any history of the relationship
between the Aboriginal and British
occupants of Australia, but it was anything
but unique.’ Bruce Kercher (ed),

New South Wales, 1788-1899

relevance of postcolonial theory to the historical study of law in colonial
societies, see Smandych,
‘The Cultural Imperialism of Law’ above n

shortly, it appears that Castles missed the fact that the Colonial Office also
disallowed the Western
Australian Act of 1841.
Governor Hutt to Lord Glenelg, 3 May
Aborigines Papers, 1844
Hutt’s view on the ultimate
desirability of racial amalgamation or assimilation as part of a well-conceived
colonial ‘native
policy’ was shared by many influential
mid-nineteenth century Evangelicals and leading Colonial Office officials like
Glenelg, James Stephen, Jr, and later Herman Merivale. See, Smandych,

initials following this minute are not clear, it was almost certainly written
Lord Russell, since he was in charge of the Colonial Office at this time.
Lord Russell to Governor Hutt, 30
April 1841, in
Aborigines Papers, 1844,
377-379. It should be noted that
his despatch, like all other important despatches send out by the Colonial
Office to the colonies
during this period dealing with legal matters, was very
likely drafted by James Stephen, Jr. According to the ‘biographical
notice’ written later by one of his famous sons, Sir James Fitzjames
Stephen, “The position which Sir James Stephen occupied
in the Colonial
Office was a very singular one. The British colonies are a collection of many
separate states, of every degree of
importance, from nations like Canada and New
South Wales down to the rock of Heligoland, inhabited by a few Germans.’
know exactly what were the powers and what the rights of the English
government in respect of each of these communities, to know
the history of all
the relations between the United Kingdom and each of its dependencies, and to be
able to give an account of the
state of parties and local politics in every one
of them, was one part that was required of the Under-Secretary of State for the
Colonies’. In addition to supplying ‘successive Secretaries of
State’ with the ‘special knowledge’
they needed in order to
make important policy decisions, it was Sir James Stephen’s duty ‘to
prepare drafts of almost
all of the more important despatches, and of the
numerous Acts of Parliament which were required by every colony’. James
Stephen, ‘Biographical Notice of Sir James Stephen’, in
Sir James Stephen,
Essays in Ecclesiastical, Biography
(new ed), (1868)
xi-xvi, xii-xiii. For a more detailed account of James Stephen’s career in
the Colonial Office, see Smandych,

Bondage: James Stephen’s Attempt to Reform the Criminal Slave Laws of the

January 1842, in
Aborigines Papers, 1844
Lord Russell to Governor Hutt, 15
February 1843, in
Aborigines Papers, 1844
401-402. This quotation
runs contrary to what Alex Castles states in above n 8, 534. Specifically, he
claims that ‘Despite some
confusion on the status of the Act in some later
writings, Lendrum’s researches have shown the second Act was not
disallowed.’
Although I have not yet had the opportunity to re-examine
Lendrum’s original research, on the face of it, it does not make
that the Colonial Office would officially disallow an Act and then later rescind
the disallowance. More recently, in the course
of the ongoing research she is
undertaking on colonial criminal law and
offences in Western
Australian in the 1830s and 1840s, Ann Hunter has found a copy of the 1841 Act
passed by the Legislative Council
of Western Australia which has an annotation
on it [ie. An asterisk next to the title of the 1841 Act] which reads:
‘See Statute
6 and 7 Vic cap 22 [1843], reciting ...that doubts had arisen
whether these Acts passed by the Legislatures of the colonies are not
to the law of England, therefore null and void, and legalizing all such
enactments’ (Personal communication from
Ann Hunter, 20 September 2003);
see also, Ann Hunter, ‘The Boundaries of Colonial Criminal Law in Relation
to Inter-Aboriginal
offences) in Western Australia in
the 1830s-1840s’ (Paper presented at the Annual Conference of the
Australian and New Zealand
Legal History Society, Brisbane, Australia, July
2003). This annotation suggests that members of the Legislative Council may have
believed that the Act was legally in effect, when in fact it had been formally
disallowed by the Colonial Office. This may well be
the case, given the
chronological sequence of the enactment of the Act of 1841 (on 26 October) and
the time-delay between the despatches
that went back and forth between Western
Australia and London, as I have documented (ie While Hutt despatched a copy of
London on 20 January 1842, Lord Russell did not reply until over a
year later, on 15 February 1843, and Russell’s despatch
probably did not
make it to Western Australia until late in 1843).

In this respect, my findings are
consistent with the more general conclusions of Jane Samson, above n 13,
Imperial Benevolence
, and similar in nature to the findings of other
recent research on the imperial influences that shaped British colonial
policy’ in the mid-nineteenth century. See, for example:

There is a significant amount of
primary historical data in the Public Record Office in London which I have
examined in relation
to the debate over the legal status of Aborigines during
and following Gawler’s tenure as Governor that I have not cited in
paper, because it takes us far beyond dealing with the narrow question of the
enactment of Aboriginal evidence acts, which is
the main focus of the present
study. Relevant data sources include: PRO, CO 16/1,

a letter from the Aborigines Protection Society inviting his attention
enclosed reprinted copy of the
Sydney Gazette
of October 10, that
reported on the ‘summary justice’ meted out to the alleged murderers
shipwreck surviours. PRO, CO 13/23, folios 132-138, Mr

Campbell and Thomas Wilde to Lord Russell, 27 March 1841. No legal action was
ever taken against O’Halloran
or Gawler, nor was an act of indemnity ever
passed by Parliament excusing them of their actions. This may have been so at
part because of the opinion expressed by James Stephen, on a minute
written on the back of the Law Officers 27 March 1841 letter
to Lord Russell, in
which he questioned whether indemnifying O’Halloran and Gawler would be
‘strictly legal’ or
‘constitutional’. Stephen also
provided an opinion on this issue in a minute he wrote on the back of
correspondence between

I have been able to determine that
James Stephen wrote the despatch because it was first written as a draft for
Lord Stanley. In

except with reference to the last part’. PRO, CO 13/23,

facilitate the admission of the unsworn testimony of the Aboriginal inhabitants
of South Australia and
parts adjacent, and transmitting copy of Ordinance No 4
of 1849 ‘to amend the first named Ordinance in conformity with Your
Lordship’s suggestions’. In this despatch, Young noted that in the
new Ordinance of 1849, a section of Ordinance No 3
of 1848 containing
‘provisions as to the corroboration of aboriginal evidence in cases of
unsworn testimony’ was repealed
because in a previous despatch Earl Grey
deemed it ‘to be superfluous’.
In this context, it is intriguing to
note that in 1844 the Legislative Council of New Zealand also passed an
‘Unsworn Testimony
Ordinance’ that allowed the evidence of
non-Christian Maori to be received in a court of law without the necessity of a
oath, and there is considerable evidence that James Stephen, Jr played
a significant role in the enactment of this and other early
local New Zealand
ordinances aimed at the gradual amalgamation of Maori custom and English law.
See Robert Joseph,
'The Government of Themselves: Case Law, Policy and
Section 71 of the New Zealand
Constitution
(2002). I would like to
thank Robert Joseph for drawing my attention to this important comparative
evidence on New Zealand.
