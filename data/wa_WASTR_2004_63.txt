Previous Application
15 My office’s records show that in application number ST/2002-000120 the
Applicant sought a Principal Order against the Strata
Company in the following
“I seek Principal Order to declare AGM August 2000 and AGM 2001 INVALID
– VOID Ab-intio (sic).
Time frame – flexible approx 3 months
COSTS to be borne by the Owners of Strata Plan No
16 The application was dealt with by my Delegate who dismissed it on
7 November 2003.
17 On the basis of his Reasons for Decision in relation to that application, my
Delegate made findings that the Strata Company’s
Annual General Meeting of
23 August 2000 and the Strata Company’s Annual General Meeting
of 7 September 2001
were valid and
that the resolutions of those
meetings were valid.
Applicant's
submissions
18 The Applicant has made a number of submissions about the validity of the
Strata Company’s 2000 AGM and 2001 AGM, has complained
resolution of the Strata Company to discontinue the services of Mc McLon Real
Estate, as the Strata Manager, and the appointment
of Bill Coates Strata
Services Pty Ltd as Strata Manager.
19 The Applicant has also questioned the authority of the Strata Company to
institute and proceed with local court proceedings against
her for the payment
of unpaid levies.
20 Although the Applicant has referred to s 102, a section which deals with
the appointment of an administrator, there is nothing
in the application which
touches on that issue.
21 The Applicant has referred to s 35. This is a section which sets out
the principal obligations of a Strata Company. There
no provision in that
section for an order to be made under the 1985 Act.
22 Section 90 provides
to supply information or documents
Where, pursuant to an application for an order under this section, the referee
considers that the strata company for the scheme to
which the application
relates, or the administrator for that scheme, or the chairman, secretary or
treasurer of that strata company
has wrongfully —
(a)withheld from the applicant information to which he is entitled under this
(b)failed to make available for inspection by the applicant or his agent a
record or document that under this Act he is entitled
to inspect,
the referee may order that strata company, administrator, chairman, secretary or
treasurer to supply or make available the information
or to make so available
the record or document, as the case may require, to the
applicant...”
23 Section 83 (1) is a general provision which would allow the Applicant,
as a lot proprietor, to seek an order
“... for the settlement of a dispute or the rectification of a complaint,
with respect to the exercise or performance of, or
the failure to exercise or
perform, the power, authority, duty or function conferred or imposed by this Act
or the by-laws...”
24 The Applicant complains about steps taken by Bellcourt Strata Services Pty
Ltd, Mr Davies ( a solicitor and a member of the Strata
Company’s Council
of Owners) and a Ms Whitehead of the law firm, Godfrey Virtue & Co, in
relation to levies collected from
the Applicants on behalf of the Strata
25 The Applicant states
“I verily believe there was OVER-collection of MONIES with the pretence of
collecting levies from proprietor of Lots 8 and
26 No other lot proprietor has supported the application.
27 The Strata Company, through its solicitors Godfrey Virtue & Co, has
opposed the application with a detailed submission in
relation to Local Court
Plaints 6490 of 2001, 6494 of 2001, 23497 of 2001, 23498 of 2001, 21647 of 2003
and 21648 of 2003.
28 In relation to each of those proceedings, judgement was given against the
Applicant and the Applicant was ordered to pay the
Strata Company’s
29 The Applicant has not appealed against any of those decision.
30 The Respondent’s solicitor states that the Respondent and Bellcourt
Strata Management Pty Ltd have always made available
the books, records and
minutes of the Strata Company for the Applicant to inspect. They advise that
the Strata Company’s minutes
and records are kept at Bellcourt Strata
Management’s offices and that the Applicant has been invited on various
to inspect those records.
31 The Respondent’s solicitors have made detailed submissions on the
basis of ‘res judicata’, issue estoppel and
estoppel, and abuse of
32 All of those submissions have been provided to the Applicant but the
Applicant’s response has continued to be, essentially,
to challenge the
appointment and authority of Bellcourt Strata Management Pty Ltd, the absence of
any specific resolution by the
Strata Company or its Council of Owners to
commence the local court proceedings, and the validity of some meetings because
alleged failure to appoint or properly appoint a chairperson.
33 In response to the ‘res judicata’ issue raised by the
Respondent’s solicitor, the Applicant maintains that
‘res judicata
does not apply’, but offers no other submission in that regard.
34 In respect of the issue estoppel claim, she
“I verily believe that when in further litigation and illegality of the
law is discovered, a matter decided by a prior judgement
will never hold as a
case with Bellcourt settlement
properly appointed and has NO LEGAL
RIGHT to instruct Katherine Whitehead to bring legal proceeding against
35 The Applicant appears to overlook the fact that all of those proceedings
were taken in the name of the Strata
Considerations
36 In my view the Applicant has had every opportunity since the first of the
Local Court proceedings commenced in 2001 to challenge
the claims made in those
proceedings, or to appeal the decisions.
37 Some of the main issues raised by her have already been dealt with by my
Delegate in previous proceedings.
38 Overall, I do not consider the application to be in a form upon which any
sensible decision could be based. I regard the application
in both its original
and amended form to be unacceptable.
39 In my view, there is no basis for making any of the orders sought whether as
Interim Orders or as Principal Orders or whether
in the terms as originally
sought or with in relation to the additional orders sought in
September 2004.
40 My Order is that
“The application be
dismissed.”
DATED 6 December 2004
