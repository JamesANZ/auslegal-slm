Land Tax Assessments - Period of Retrospectivity (LTA-007) [2008] VICSROLTA 1 (1 December 2008)
Revenue Ruling LTA 007
This Revenue Ruling addresses the retrospective
assessment of any land tax outstanding for past periods
(period of retrospectivity) by the Commissioner of
State Revenue (Commissioner). It should be read in
conjunction with Revenue Ruling GEN014 (Assessments
– Periods of Retrospectivity) (GEN014).
Land Tax Act 2005
(the Act) came into effect
on 1 January 2006 and applies to land tax liabilities
for the 2006 tax year onwards. Further, the
Administration Act 1997
(TAA) was amended to make
the Act a ‘taxation law’ from 1 January 2006. As a
result, a land tax liability for the 2006 and subsequent
tax years comes within the scope of the Act and
assessment for the tax liability falls under the TAA.
From 1 July 2007, the refund period under the TAA has
increased from three to five years. In order to maintain
parity with the increase to a five year refund period, the
period of retrospective assessing has also increased from
three to five years. The application of the increase in
the period of retrospectivity to land tax assessments is
explained further in this Revenue Ruling.
The purpose of this Revenue Ruling is to explain how
liability for land tax, including that of taxpayers who are
assessed for the first time for land tax purposes, is to be
assessed retrospectively under the TAA.
For an explanation of the italicised terms in this Ruling,
refer to GEN014.
As land tax is assessed on a calendar year basis, the
period of retrospectivity for land tax assessments is also
based on calendar years.
The period of retrospectivity consists of the current
calendar year in which the
Reference Date
falls, plus
the four preceding calendar years (except in certain
circumstances, which are discussed under ‘Exceptions to
the five-year period’ below).
The period of retrospectivity commences from the
Reference Date
, which is defined in GEN014 as the
earliest date on which:
1. the Commissioner receives a
from a taxpayer
investigation commenced
3. a taxpayer is
advised of a tax liability
Although the period of retrospectivity has been
increased to five years, the five year period does not
apply to a tax liability which occurred before the 2006
tax year (except in certain circumstances, which are
discussed under ‘Exceptions to the five-year period’).
This is because the Act only applies to land tax liabilities
for the 2006 tax year onwards. Land tax liabilities
for periods prior to the 2006 tax year are assessed
Land Tax Act 1958
(refer to ‘Retrospective
assessments under the
Land Tax Act 1958
The following examples illustrate the application of the
period of retrospectivity for land tax under the Act:
GEN014 explains the approach to retrospective
assessments where a taxpayer has an outstanding land
tax liability and the State Revenue Office (SRO) has
not previously assessed that taxpayer for land tax. In
such cases, GEN014 explains that the taxpayer is only
assessed for the current calendar year.
This practice will be phased out progressively, beginning
in 2009, so that by 2013 such taxpayers can be assessed
retrospectively for five years. The following examples illustrate
how the period of retrospectivity will apply in such cases:

Ruling history
Issued date
December 2008
Dates of effect
Exceptions to the five-year period
The period of retrospectivity is not limited to five years
for special land tax assessments or if there is
intentional disregard
of a taxation law or the
SRO is of the view that the taxpayer has misled the
SRO, whether by withholding information or providing
inaccurate information relevant to the land tax liability.
Retrospective assessments under the
Land Tax Act
Land Tax Act 1958
(the 1958 Act) applies to liabilities
for land tax which arose prior to the 2006 tax year.
In respect of a land tax liability incurred under the
1958 Act, the Commissioner will generally only assess
up to three assessment years prior to the year in which
liability for land tax is first incurred. However, the period
of retrospectivity is not limited to three prior years
for special land tax assessments or if there is
intentional disregard
of a taxation law or the
SRO is of the view that the taxpayer has misled the
SRO, whether by withholding information or providing
inaccurate information relevant to the land tax liability.
