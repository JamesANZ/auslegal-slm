JUDGE: Are you trying to show contempt for this court?
MAE WEST: No, I’m doin’ my best to hide
Proceedings for contempt of court are not a common event in Australia.
Perhaps that is why the stories of mistakes made during contempt
proceedings are
legion. There has been uncertainty about whether to proceed, when to proceed and
how to proceed. Those uncertainties
have been laid to rest by this monumental
work by Professor David Rolph.
scholarship and the ease with which he exposes and explains the law of contempt
make this a singular work — it is an essential
resource for anyone wanting
(or having) to dip their toes into the formerly turbid waters of contempt.
The book starts, sensibly enough, with an introduction to the law of
contempt, an examination of the nature of contempt, and the sources
contempt of court has existed from time immemorial.
It is not surprising, then,
that the jurisdiction has not developed in a single, simple line, but has
exhibited all the hallmarks
of common law doctrines that develop over time.
While common lawyers perceive a certain charm in that form of evolution, it can
difficulties for those seeking to find answers to particular
One of the book’s major achievements is the creation of a sensible and
manageable classification of the various types of contempt
that can arise. Those
who have previously ventured into this field know that there has been a lack of
structure, which has led to
the types of criticism seen in the Victorian Law
Reform Commission’s 2019 Consultation Paper on this
Until the publication of Rolph’s book it was not unfair to describe the
treatment of the law in this area as amorphous and inconsistent.
While there may
still be valid complaints about the nature of the process and its application,
the detailed structure advanced by
the author, together with the clear-headed
examination under each division now provides anyone with a logical path for
consideration.
The author provides detailed consideration of:
• the distinction between civil and criminal contempt;
• sub judice contempt;
• scandalising the court;
• disclosure of jury deliberations;
• interference with the administration of justice;
• contempt in the face of the court;
• disclosure of journalists’ sources;
• civil contempt;
• frustrating/subverting court orders;
• procedure; and
• penalties and relief.
While the mere size of the book may appear daunting, there is no reason to be
concerned. The information and examination of principle
is conveyed in
bite-sized chunks that are accessible to both the seasoned practitioner and to
those approaching (with some trepidation)
this area. The value of the work is
magnified by a comprehensive index and a detailed table of contents. Each
chapter is preceded
by its own list of contents that allows the reader to easily
examine the deeper levels of this hierarchically organised treatment
Apart from the careful categorisation of the law referred to above, Rolph
also uncovers the sometimes-minor differences in the various
courts in the
Australian federation when dealing with contempt. An invaluable chapter (which
is, naturally, not available in the
standard English texts) contains
consideration of contempt of other decision-making bodies such as Royal
Commissions, administrative
and other tribunals, and Coroners Courts.
It should not surprise anyone that
Rolph on Contempt
has already been
cited several times — in the High Court of Australia, the Supreme Courts
of various States and the Federal
Court of Australia. That is explained by the
fact that the book is designed to be used by practitioners and judges alike. It
with the practical legal difficulties that arise and it does so from the
point of view of someone who is seeking a solution. It is
written by someone who
fully understands that contempt proceedings can arise unexpectedly, that they
can be impressed with the need
for expedition, and that the path to resolution
of a contempt proceeding is strewn with hazards. Rolph shows the reader where
hazards are and how they can be met. It is an Australian classic.
