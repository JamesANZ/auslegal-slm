REASONS FOR DECISION
Mr Leo Williams AO - Chairman
Mr Brock Miller - Deputy Chairman
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
This is an Appeal by Mr Darren Ian Hooper against the penalty of six months
disqualification imposed upon him by the Stewards of Harness
Racing Queensland
as a result of him presenting the horse River Valley Rocket in breach of Rule
190(1) of the Rules of Harness Racing.
Rule 190(1) provides:
“A horse shall be presented for a race
free of a prohibited substance”
River Valley Rocket had a pre-race blood sample taken prior to it racing in
Race 7 of the Redcliffe Harness Racing Club Meeting on
27 May 2009. A
certificate of analysis from the Racing Science Centre stated the total plasma
carbon dioxide (“TCO2”)
concentration of the sample to be 37.2
mmol/L. The confirmatory sample from Racing Analytical Services Limited showed
of 36.9 mmol/L. The allowed threshold concentration for TCO2 is 36
mmol/L and there is allowed a 1.0mmol/L concentration for uncertainty
measurement.
At the Stewards Inquiry held on 15 June 2009, Mr Hooper advised the Stewards
of his training and feeding regime for River Valley Rocket
and how as the horse
had been “tying up fairly badly” he gave the horse additional
Nutradex to flush out the horse’s
system. This was administered both on
the Sunday afternoon and the Monday morning before the Redcliffe race on the
Wednesday. Nutradex
contains citrates which may elevate a horse’s TCO2.
Mr Hooper entered a plea of Guilty at the Stewards Inquiry and the Stewards
then went on to impose a penalty of 6 months disqualification.
When imposing a
penalty the Stewards stated (page 29 from line 15 of the Stewards
Transcript):
“THE CHAIRMAN: Gents, we have considered it in depth. A few
things we took into consideration were your submissions; we have
also taken into
consideration the penalties that have been handed down with TCO2 or bicarbonate
offences. But in the wash-up, Mr
Hooper, we do believe that the correct penalty
is a disqualification, and we think for varying away from what has been
for first-time offenders, is a disqualification for 6
While from the Tribunal’s own experience and on review of the penalties
imposed for elevated TCO2 readings, a period of 6 months
disqualification is
considered the common penalty, the Tribunal does, of course, need to consider
what is an appropriate penalty
in the circumstances of each matter.
Mr Hooper is a full time trainer and his income is dependent upon being
involved in the Industry. He has the support of his major
owner, Mr Whiteoak,
who is also the owner of River Valley Rocket. Mr Whiteoak appeared in support
of Mr Hooper at the Stewards Inquiry.
Mr Hooper employs 3 persons at his stable
and there is no doubt that any disqualification will cause him severe
There is no evidence not to accept Mr Hooper’s explanation of him
administering Nutradex to the horse’s feed. While it
was incumbent on Mr
Hooper to know the ingredients of Nutradex, there is no suggestion that he tried
to take an advantage by racing
the horse with an elevated TCO2 level.
At the Inquiry Mr Hooper handled himself properly and professionally and
entered a plea of guilty at the first opportunity. He was
completely open with
the Stewards as to his feeding and training regime and prepared to present his
log books for substantiation.
In the circumstances of the administration of Nutradex, the hardship that
would be caused to Mr Hooper and the way he presented himself
at the Stewards
Inquiry, the Tribunal is of the opinion that a period of 3 months and a fine of
$1,000.00 should be the appropriate
penalty. The Tribunal makes the following
1. Appeal against penalty upheld;
2. Penalty varied to 3 months
disqualification and $1,000.00 fine.
3. Appeal deposit fee refunded to
Mr Leo Williams
