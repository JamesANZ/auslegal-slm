HIS HONOUR:
Branson, you are pleading guilty to a single charge of perverting the course of
justice. The charge carries a penalty of level
2 imprisonment (25 years
will sentence you to a community correction order of two years in length, with
orders requiring you to perform 220 hours of community
service and in addition
undertake drug and alcohol counselling and maintain your counselling with your
treating practitioner.
Brief factual circumstances
prosecution summary was tendered as exhibit P1 and accepted by you as accurately
setting out the circumstances of the offending.
I will not repeat it. Very
briefly, you had lost your licence in late 2022 as you had failed an oral fluid
test taken when you were
driving. That resulted in a licence cancellation and
disqualification for 12 months. When you applied to Magistrate Wighton in April
2023 to reactivate your licence, you were required to provide clean urine
screens. You supplied five.
Magistrate Wighton required ten. In May 2023, you provided two further screens,
but were told three more were required. Rather than
provide completed screens,
you paid someone about $400 to obtain false screens. You then went before
Magistrate Sim on 17 July 2023
and relied on the false screens. Magistrate Sim
reinstated your licence, and you have been driving since July 2023.
false screens were discovered and reported to Horsham Police Station on 20 July
In January 2024, you
voluntarily attended Horsham Police
You were arrested and
charged. You pleaded guilty at an early stage to one charge of perverting the
course of justice by the provision
of the false screens. You have been on bail
since this time.
plea was heard in the Koori Court on 20 October 2025. At that time you accepted
your limited prior criminal history – which
details very low-level
offending and is of limited relevance, which I will come to – and
participated in the Koori Court sentencing
conversation. A large amount of
material was tendered. I will come to that.
were born in May 1991 and are currently 34 years of age. You have been in a
relationship with your partner Warren for the past
10 years. You have four
children, aged 14, 12, 9 and 8. You live in rental accommodation in

man, Gerald David Branson, who is a Narangga
man from the Point Pearce region of
South Australia.

and siblings at a young age.

Tragically, she was found murdered in 1982. After
this, your father started
drinking heavily to cope.
were aged about five your mother left home, and you did not see her after that
time. At that point your father began heavily
consuming alcohol again and moved
the family all over Australia.
went to too many schools to count, across nearly every state in Australia, and
in about grade 4 moved to Horsham. There, you
came in and out of the care of
your Aunty Pam, who also participated in the sentencing conversation. It is fair
to say that you were
moved between numerous homes, sometimes into state care,
but often with various family members.
2011 you and your partner at the time, Bryce, had your first child. He is the
eldest of the children living with you and Warren
at the moment. You had a
second child with Bryce; however, in late 2013 you separated from Bryce. In 2014
you and Warren began your
relationship, and it continues
May 2023 you began working as an administration officer with the Barengi Gadjin
Land Council Aboriginal
Corporation.
Initially this was
five days a week, and on the basis that you obtain your driver’s licence.
One of the reasons you give for
falsifying the urine screens was to regain your
licence as soon as possible to fulfil your obligations to your employer. You
employed with the Land Corporation, now working three days per week.

Objective seriousness of the offending
the course of justice is a serious charge. This much is reflected in the
statutory maximum of 25 years. In this case, I
consider your offending to be
relatively low-level. It occurred in a situation which you explained was to
allow you to get back to
work. This had been part of your employment conditions.
It is obvious that this was front of your mind when trying to obtain your
licence. There was very little pre-planning. While it is true you did commission
the false screens, and paid for them, it was not
a terribly sophisticated
enterprise. The prosecution is correct to assert that it took some time to
obtain the false documents, and
you made a decision to not use the earlier
original ones as this would highlight the false documents, so there was a degree
which went into what you were doing. However, you did disclose
immediately to the doctor’s clinic that the documents which
you required
printed were false. This is evidence that you were not endeavouring very hard to
cover up your wrongdoing.
Moral culpability
is accepted that the principles in
are enlivened by
reason of your history of intergenerational trauma, and, in addition, your
father’s very specific alcoholism,
and your itinerant disjointed life as a
child surrounded by your father’s alcoholism.
parties were in some disagreement as to the application of
I accept, because of the premeditation involved in this offending, that
there is only a slight dampening effect on the moral
culpability which ought be
attached to your offending by reasons of
limb 1. I understand
that reliance is placed on paragraph [33] of Mr Campbell’s report, which
locates your offending in the
context of your history and your psychiatric state
as being overly anxious.
those circumstances, faced with losing your job or finding a quick way to
resolve the issue of providing a clean screen, you took
the option, out of a
feeling of pressure caused by your psychiatric state. I can accept this, but the
level of premeditation works
against it to some extent, and, as I have
indicated, only slightly dampens the level of moral culpability attached to your
Relevant sentencing principles
Remorse/responsibility
accept by reason of your very early plea and your participation in Koori Court
that this stands as evidence of your remorse and
also your taking of
responsibility for your actions. Your longtime friend, Shonelle Ritchie, spoke
of your fundamental acceptance
of your wrongdoing and your willingness to work
on your own character flaws and psychological issues in order to make sure you
offend again. I accept that you have demonstrated complete remorse and
have taken responsibility for your actions.
Past criminal
accept that there is past criminal history in relation to driving offences, both
for failing oral fluid tests and driving whilst
not authorised, from 2016 and
2017. These matters were well in the past when this offending occurred some six
years later. They bear
little on the sentence I will
Denunciation
accept that there must be a real element of denunciation in the sentence I
impose because you have falsified documents before a
court which had made clear
its requirements of you to be relicensed. You had demonstrated clearly that you
could obtain such screens,
and you chose another path. Behaviour such as this
must be denounced. It is relevant in considering this that you have also written
a personal letter of apology to Magistrate Sim explaining your behaviour and
apologising for it. This is to your credit.
Protection of the

Rehabilitation
looms as a primary sentencing factor in this case. You are only 34 years of age.
You have four children. You have work in a very
supportive workplace. You have
embarked on a number of courses, and you have good support from your employer
and family network.
All these things would be thrown into jeopardy if you were
to spend time in prison. Rather, given your almost unblemished record
and the fundamental work you are now doing to ensure this does not happen again,
you are on the right path, I think, for
rehabilitating. This is particularly
important in your situation to make sure that intergenerational trauma does not
continue by
your children seeing you go to jail. That does not serve the
community well at all.
Synthesising
all these matters, I conclude that the most appropriate sentence in your case is
a community correction order, as I have
outlined above. There are no
pre-sentence detention days to declare.
