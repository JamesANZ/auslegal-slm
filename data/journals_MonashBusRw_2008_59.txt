Role of the ASX
Monash Macquarie Financial Services conference
Ten years after the idea was first mooted in Australia to establish a regulatory ‘licensed market operator’ and six years
after it was enacted in the Financial Services Reforms, there is still little understanding, even within financial markets, of the
role of the ASX: is it a regulator; does it prudentially regulate brokers?
The Australian Securities Exchange’s (ASX) capacity to enforce standards is limited to the rules which the ASX itself created
rather than rules imposed on it by legislation or regulators. The ASX is not a financial market ‘regulator’ as it has
no legislated power to enforce the provisions of the Corporations Act. Nor should it. The ASX is best described as a regulated entity
with limited supervisory functions (see diagram).
For the objectives of the regulatory framework to be fully achieved, there needs to be considerable co-ordination and co-operation
between the ASX, regulatory agencies and the Government. This co-ordination and co-operation contributes to the occasional misunderstanding
among some stakeholders as to the separate roles undertaken by supervisors, regulators and legislators. However, this has traditionally
been seen as a price worth paying to maintain a regulatory framework that successfully leverages the multilateral contract structure
underpinning listing, trade execution, clearing and settlement venues to achieve public interest goals.
While the law administered by ASIC and the rules administered by the ASX both establish minimum standards for brokers, the areas of
overlap are quite small, confined to a narrow area of ASX-listed products for only those financial service providers who have a direct
contractual relationship with the ASX.
Securities exchange rules actually pre-date legislation as a means of regulating equity and derivative markets. However, over time
governments have recognised the public policy benefits of many market standard-setting rules and have incorporated these into law.
The end result is that in most developed countries, the market operator’s supervisory role has narrowed as Governments progressively
assume more of the responsibility for intermediary regulation.
This is not to suggest that the functions that remain with market operators are unimportant. The ‘front-line’ role of
monitoring particular types of conduct by particular types of market users that have a trade execution and settlement focus remains
fundamental to achieve market integrity. Without this there could be no enforcement action, whether taken by a market operator in
relation to its rules or another body in relation to legislation.
Market supervisor role
The ASX sets rules and establishes minimum standards that define the operation of its markets. The rules are multilateral contracts
between the ASX and its direct customers: listing rules, market rules and clearing and settlement rules. Because this contract structure
provides the opportunity to shape the behaviour of market users, the Corporations Act sets out minimum content requirements for the
The ASX monitors only those activities that are directly connected with ASX service offerings: a broker’s trade execution activities,
but not its securities lending, equity swaps or other off-market activities. On this basis, the ASX can be distinguished from ASIC
and APRA which are regulators with powers conferred by Government.
Thus, the ASX has no capacity to create a market-wide standard precluding investors (who are not contractually bound to observe ASX
rules) from engaging in insider trading, market manipulation, or the spreading of false rumours. This is done by legislation.
By virtue of having established a multilateral contract with listed companies, brokers and others, the ASX has created for itself
an ability to oversee the conduct of these financial market participants. Where ASX monitoring of conduct by market users reveals
a breach of standards established by the ASX, rather than by law, the ASX has the power to initiate disciplinary proceedings only
if the offending conduct was undertaken by an organisation, such as a broker, that had entered into a contract with the ASX.
Listing Rules:
Establish rules for the admission, expulsion and ongoing quotation of securities by listed entities.
Facilitate the release of information to the market, including material announcements, by companies, their directors or their substantial
shareholders.
ASX does not
Regulate the activity of listed entities generally: eg regulate incorporation, directors’ duties, takeovers or insolvency.
Determine what specific information is material to a listed company, or anticipate when a shareholder or director has an obligation
to lodge a notice.
Market Rules:
Establish rules for the admission, expulsion and ongoing obligations of Market Participants.
Monitor Participant conduct that directly impacts on the market: eg monitor for insider trading and compliance with ASX’s client
order priority rules and crossing rules.
ASX does not
Regulate related bodies-corporate, associated entities, or third-party contracts entered into by Participants.
Regulate conduct by brokers, financial advisers, financial planners or any other AFSL holders in relation to OTC activities including
margin lending, securities lending/borrowing, etc.
Regulate or supervise the activities of non-ASX Participants in any way.
