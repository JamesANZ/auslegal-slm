MINOR CIVIL DISPUTE – APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL AND APPEAL
– application for an extension of time to apply for leave
to appeal and
appeal – request for reasons for decision – application for leave to
appeal and appeal filed before reasons
for decision handed down –
extension of time unnecessary
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2009
REASONS FOR DECISION
applicant (‘Dr Quach’) has filed an application for leave to appeal
or appeal (‘appeal application’).
Also, he has filed an application
to extend or shorten a time limit or for waiver of compliance with procedural
requirements (‘extension
of time application’). The latter
application is now before the Appeal Tribunal for decision.
Application for leave to appeal or appeal
appeal application alleges a denial of the natural justice. It is particularised
in the following terms:
Partners Pty Ltd is a trader
109 of the Australian
Constitution
, the definition of trader under the
Constitution
and Australian Consumer Laws prevail over an inconsistency between
state laws.
[3] The relief
(a) a declaration that the signed offer is invalid; and
(b) a new REIQ contract of sale for 72 Crosby Road, Albion typed up and
populated to be executed.
[4] Dr Quach, in
his extension of time application, applies for an extension of the time to file
in the Tribunal the appeal application
to 5 June 2025. He later repeats what he
says in the submissions accompanying the appeal application. It reads:
On the 20 March 2025, I called QCAT regarding lodging an appeal. I was told that
I require a transcript to lodge an appeal. While
on the call, I attempted to
request the transcript from Qtranscipt. There was no record of a transcript. I
was then instructed by
QCAT telephone consultant to send an email to
enquiresqcat@justice.qld.gov.au
to obtain the transcript. I waited for QCAT to reply with the transcript
requested. However, that did not happen.
On the 26 May 2025, I personally attended the QCAT registry in Brisbane. I met
Nicholas from the Appeals Team. Nicholas said that
the information provided to
me by the QCAT telephone consultant was not correct and that because of this,
QCAT would consider favourably
an application for an extension of time.
Respondent’s submissions in reply
respondent (‘GLC Partners’) has filed submissions in reply to the
extension of time application. It sets out the
background to the
application.
[6] GLC Partners
were appointed by Sheetal and Rhian Bull to sell their residential home at 72
Crosby Road, Albion.
February 2025 Dr Quach made application to the Tribunal for a minor civil
dispute – consumer/trader dispute (‘original
application’). He
alleges he was deceived by GLC Partners when he made an offer and entered a
contract of sale to purchase
the residential property.
[8] Dr Quach, on
the same day, made application to the Tribunal for a stay order on the ground he
was deceived by GLC Partners. The
Tribunal dismissed the application on 13
February 2025.
February 2025 the Tribunal gave directions in the following terms:
Tribunal intends to consider whether the application for minor civil dispute -
consumer trader dispute should be dismissed on
the grounds that the Tribunal
does not have jurisdiction to hear it. This is because:
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2009
(Qld) (QCAT Act) confers the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over minor civil
disputes. A minor civil dispute is relevantly defined
as a claim arising out of
a contract between a consumer and trader.
(b) Consumer and trader are terms defined in Schedule 3 of the QCAT Act where,
relevantly a consumer is an individual for whom services
are supplied for fee
other than in a trade or business carried on by the individual and a trader is a
person who in trade or commerce
carries on a business of supplying services
other than when acting in the exercise of a discipline that is not ordinarily
as within the field of trade or commerce.
Early Property Group Pty Ltd t/a Early Group Valuers v Cavallaro
[2010] QCATA 65
, Deputy President Kingham J, stated, in considering whether a
valuer came within the exception to the definition of trader:
[17] If the exemption in the definition of trader in the QCAT Act
is to have any application at all, it must operate to exclude professionals
whose disciplines are not ordinarily regarded as within the field of trade or
commerce. A discipline is:
branch of instruction or learning.
[18] Santow J explored the
meaning of profession in
Prestia v Aknar
. He offered the following as a
working definition:
This would embrace intellectual activity, or manual activity controlled by
the intellectual skill of the operator, whereby services
are offered to the
public, usually though not inevitably for reward and requiring professional
standards of competence, training
and ethics, typically reinforced by some form
of official accreditation accompanied by evidence of qualification.
[19] That formulation is, respectfully, a helpful one in interpreting the
meaning of the exemption in the definition of trader in
the QCAT Act.
(d) Real estate agents have been found to exercise a profession or discipline
and, therefore, have been found to fall outside the
definition of trader for
QCAT's jurisdiction.
party is directed to file in the Tribunal and give a copy to the other party of
their submissions on the question of jurisdiction,
namely, whether the
respondent is a trader as defined in the QCAT Act, by
4:00pm on 8 March
Tribunal will determine the question of jurisdiction on the papers, based on the
written submissions of the parties, after
4:00pm on 8 March 2025

final hearing.

2025 the Tribunal dismissed the proceeding. Dr Quach, on 20 March 2025, sent an
email to the Tribunal asking for
reasons for the decision ‘

I can Appeal.
[11] On 5 June
2025 Dr Quach filed the appeal application.
Tribunal gave directions for the filing of the extension of time application on
17 June 2025.
[13] On 2 July
2025 Dr Quach filed the extension of time application.
Tribunal, on 18 June 2025, handed down reasons for decision in the original
application.
Partners’ submissions in reply go on to outline reasons for not granting
the extension of time application. The submissions
are unnecessary given an
extension of time is not required for the reasons following.
Legislation
right of appeal against a decision of the Tribunal in a proceeding is found in
section 142
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2009
(Qld) (‘QCAT Act’). Subsection (1) provides:
a proceeding may appeal to the appeal tribunal against a decision of the
tribunal in the proceeding if a judicial member
did not constitute the tribunal
in the proceeding.
decision in the proceeding is a decision for a minor civil dispute. Dr Quach
therefore requires the Appeal Tribunal’s
[18] Section 143
of the QCAT Act provides for appealing or applying for leave to appeal. The
application or appeal must:
(a) be in a form substantially complying with the rules;
(b) state the reasons for the application or appeal; and
(c) be accompanied by the prescribed fee (if any).
[19] Importantly,
an application for the Appeal Tribunal’s leave to appeal must be filed in
the registry within 28 days after
the relevant day.
Relevant day
for an application or appeal is defined in section 143(5). Relevantly, the
definition includes the day the person is given written
reasons for the decision
being appealed against. The time may be extended by the tribunal under section
61(1) of the QCAT Act.
Consideration
proceeding was dismissed on 12 March 2025. Dr Quach asked the Tribunal for
reasons for the decision eight days later, on
20 March 2025. On 5 June 2025, 13
days before the reasons for the decision were handed down, Dr Quach filed the
appeal application.
[21] It follows,
in my opinion, the appeal application was filed in the Tribunal within the time
prescribed by section 143(5)(c).
Indeed, it was filed before the day specified
in the section commenced.
