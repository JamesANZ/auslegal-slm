Reasons for Decision
[1] United Workers Union, Industrial Union of Employees, Queensland ('UWU')
applied to the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission
('the Commission') on
20 October 2025 to vary the
Parents' and Citizens' Associations Award –
('the Award') to rectify errors contained within Tables 1 and 2
of Schedule 9.
Queensland Council of Parents and Citizens Associations ('P&C') is the
Respondent, and the application is made by consent.
Neither party sought to make
further submissions in relation to this application.
Section 147
Industrial Relations Act 2016
(Qld) ('the
') sets out the power
of the Commission to make or vary modern awards, providing that:
(1) The commission may do either of the following to provide for fair and just
employment conditions –
(a) make a modern award;
(b) make an order varying a modern award.
(2) The commission may exercise a power under this section –
(a) on its own initiative; or
(b) on the application of any of the following persons –
(i) the Minister;
(ii) an organisation;
(iii) an Employer;
(iv) an employee; or
(c) on a review of a modern award under
[4] The Award
applies to all employees who are employed in an activity conducted by a Parents
and Citizens Association within Queensland;
and whose rates of pay are fixed by
the Award. This application only impacts those employees engaged under the
Outside School Hours
Care ('OSHC') and Vacation Care Stream of the Award.
[5] On 20 March
2025 the Commission ordered a variation of the Award to enable Queensland
Parents and Citizens Associations to be
eligible to apply for funding under the
Commonwealth Government ECEC Worker Retention Payment Scheme to lift wages of
OSHC employees.
To be eligible, an
employer must engage its workforce under a legally enforceable workplace
instrument (such as a state based modern
award) which includes an obligation to
pay their eligible workers rates under the grant scheme terms if they receive
that funding.
The required provisions were inserted into the Award as Schedule
September 2025, following the Queensland State Wage decision of the Full
which ordered all state
awards be varied by a wage increase of 3.5% for full-time adult employees from 1
September 2025, the wage
rates in clause 12 of the Award and contained within
Schedule 9 were updated in accordance with the Order. The varied Award was
on 24 September 2025.
publication, a small number of errors in the payrates contained in Tables 1 and
2 of Schedule 9 have been identified. The
consent application contended the
amendments are required to ensure that P&C's who are in receipt of the
Worker Retention Payment
Grant are paying employees in accordance with the terms
of the Grant. If not rectified, the errors will also lead to overpayments.
Substantive variations sought
[8] The specific
amendments sought were detailed by the Applicant in a proposed consent order.
The variation is proposed to apply
from 1 September 2025, when the new award
rates applied.

classifications within Tables 1 and 2 of Schedule 9 are proposed to be amended
