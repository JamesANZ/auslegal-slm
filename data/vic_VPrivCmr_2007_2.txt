Complainant AG v Local Council
[2007] VPrivCmr
Disclosure of personal information
– allegation that a
kindergarten operated under licence from the local council disclosed personal
information for an unauthorised
purpose. Data security
allegation that kindergarten failed to take reasonable steps to secure the
personal information from unauthorised disclosure.
Whether licence is a State
Contract within the definition of section 17 IPA between local council and
kindergarten.
The Complaint
The Complainants are a married couple with a four year-old son. The
Complainants made two complaints; one on their own behalf and
one on their and
their son’s behalf.
The Complainants’ son attended a local kindergarten operated under
licence from the Local Council. The Complainants wanted to
complain to the
kindergarten in relation to fee advice given to them by their son’s
kindergarten teacher. They telephoned the
Committee President of the
kindergarten and were told to make a written complaint to her, which would be
confidential. The Complainants
were told that the only other people who would
view the written complaint would be other committee members at the kindergarten.
Complainants made the written complaint to the President of the
kindergarten.
Around one month later, the President contacted the Complainants and informed
them that she had shown their letter to the kindergarten
teacher about whom the
complaint related, and that the teacher was very upset by the letter.
The Complainants stated that the teacher subsequently refused to teach their
son due to her distress over the contents of the letter.
As a result, the
Complainants had to relocate their son to a new kindergarten.
Shortly after this, the Complainants received a telephone call from an
unknown staff member at the original kindergarten asking them
to come and
collect their son’s personal file and other items. One of the Complainants
promptly attended the kindergarten and
saw that his son’s file had been
left open on a desk in the administration office. The file contained personal
information
reasons why he had to repeat a year and his personal contact
IPP 2 – Disclosure
The Complainants alleged that by passing
on their written complaint to their son’s kindergarten teacher, the
kindergarten used
the information for a purpose other than the purpose for
collection.
IPP 4 – Data Security
The Complainants alleged that by
leaving their son’s personal file open in the administration office, the
kindergarten failed
to take reasonable steps to prevent the information from
unauthorised disclosure.
Response to the Complaint
The Local Council advised that it did not believe that it was the proper
respondent to the complaint due to the Licence Agreement
between it and the
kindergarten. It claimed that the Licence Agreement was a State Contract within
the meaning of section 17(2) of
Information Privacy Act
thus the kindergarten was responsible under section 17(4) IPA for any breaches
of the IPA.
The kindergarten did not concede that the Licence Agreement between it and
the Local Council constituted a State Contract within the
meaning of section
17(2) IPA or that it was responsible for any breaches of the IPA. While
reserving its position with respect to
the existence of a State Contract, the
kindergarten answered the privacy complaint as outlined below.
The kindergarten stated that the primary purpose of
collecting the information was to determine whether there was any substance in
the allegations contained in the complaint. The disclosure to the teacher was an
essential part of the kindergarten’s investigation
into the allegations
and, the disclosure was therefore for a secondary purpose, which was directly
related to the primary purpose
of collection.
The kindergarten denied that any assurance was given at any time to the
Complainants that their complaint would be kept confidential.
On the contrary,
the kindergarten claimed that the Committee President expressly informed the
Complainants that their complaint would
be brought to the attention of their
son’s teacher for the purpose of ascertaining her response.
The kindergarten denied that the Complainants’
son’s personal file was left in a communal area. The only property left
a communal area belonging to the Complainant’s son was two Christmas gifts
and a photo book. It was submitted that these
items did not constitute personal
information within the meaning of the IPA.
The Privacy Commissioner has no determinative powers and, as such, cannot
decide whether the Licence Agreement between the Local Council
kindergarten has effectively passed on responsibility for compliance with the
Section 17(4) IPA clearly states that unless an outsourcing organisation can
establish that a provision of the kind referred to in
section 17(2) was in force
under a State Contract, then the act or practice in question must be taken to
have been done by the outsourcing
organisation (the Local Council) as well as
the contracted service provider (the kindergarten). Where there is a dispute
the contracted service provider and the outsourcing organisation, then
the outsourcing organisation will be considered liable.
Where a person raises a complaint with an organisation about
the actions of a particular individual within that organisation, it is
necessary to seek a response from the individual who is the subject of the
complaint in order to afford natural justice. ‘Natural
requires that where an allegation is made about an individual, and as a result
it is proposed that action be taken
against the person being complained about,
it is only fair that that person be given a right of response in order for the
to be properly and fairly investigated.
In light of the particular circumstances of this complaint and despite the
parties’ conflicting version of events, the allegations
against the
teacher could not have been adequately addressed unless the teacher was given an
opportunity to respond. Therefore, showing
the complaint to the teacher was
arguably part of the primary purpose of its collection, and in any event a
related secondary purpose.
A reasonable person in the Complainants’
position should reasonably expect that in the interests of natural justice,
s/he has complained about a specific conversation held with a certain
individual, that this individual would have to be consulted
order to ascertain whether or not there was any basis to the complaint.
The Privacy Commissioner declined to entertain the first complaint on the
grounds that the act complained about was not an interference
Complainants’ privacy (section 29(1)(a) IPA).
There were irreconcilable versions of events provided by the
Complainants and the kindergarten as to whether or not the Complainant’s
son’s personal file was left open in a communal area. The Privacy
Commissioner has no powers of determination and is unable
to make findings of
fact in relation to issues presented by disputing parties.
In the absence of established facts, the Privacy Commissioner could not
conclude that it was appropriate to decline to entertain the
complaint under
section 29(1) IPA, but rather had to decide whether it was possible to
conciliate the complaint. Given that the parties’
views on the facts
differed to such a degree, the Privacy Commissioner concluded that it would not
be reasonably possible for the
complaint to be successfully conciliated in
accordance with section 32(1) IPA.
