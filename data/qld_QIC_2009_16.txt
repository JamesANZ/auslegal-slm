Peter Vincent Twigg v Lock Up Concrete Pumping Pty Ltd [2009] QIC 16; 191 QGIG 66 (7 May 2009)
[Extract from Queensland Government Industrial
dated 22 May, 2009, Vol. 191, No. 3, pages
INDUSTRIAL COURT OF QUEENSLAND
Workplace Health and
Safety Act 1995
- s. 164(3) - appeal against decision of industrial
Peter Vincent Twigg AND Lock Up Concrete Pumping Pty Ltd
(C/2008/50)
PRESIDENT HALL
By a complaint made on 8 August 2008, Lock Up Concrete Pumping Pty Ltd was
charged with a breach of s. 24 of the
Workplace Health and Safety Act
(the Act). The workplace health and safety obligation said not to have
been discharged was that at s. 28(1) of the Act. There was
a circumstance of
aggravation,
a grievous bodily harm injury to Matthew
There was a timely plea of guilt, cooperation with the
investigators and remedial action to ensure that such an incident could not
occur in the future. The Defendant was admitted to be a good corporate
It was common ground at first instance that the appropriate
range upon which the Industrial Magistrate would ordinarily have been
to focus was $30,000 to $40,000. However, Counsel for the Defendant submitted
that the Defendant's circumstances were so
straightened that a fine of $20,000
should be imposed. Reliance was placed upon
Newman v Aldo's Fine Foods Pty
[2002] QIC 5
(2002) 169 QGIG 151
Low v BBC Hardware Ltd
[2006] QIC 39
(2006) 182 QGIG
The Industrial Magistrate accepted the submission and imposed a fine of
$20,000. This is an Appeal against the quantum of the fine.
(There is no
appeal against the Industrial Magistrate's order that the Defendant pay $900 by
way of investigation costs and $65.40
costs of court; neither is there an appeal
against the Industrial Magistrate's decision not to record a
conviction.)
Counsel for the Defendant did not rely on submissions from
the bar table. Counsel went into evidence. The Defendant's tax returns
balance sheets were exhibited to a statutory declaration by its Director.
Regrettably, it was delivered (very) late to the Complainant's
representative.
An adjournment might have been sought. In fact, the Industrial Magistrate was
"We've just had a quick look at that. I haven't actually gone into any sort
of business records as such, so I can't really make
that decision. I would
therefore be looking to leave it in your capable hands.".
circumstances, it was not surprising that the Industrial Magistrate treated the
tax returns and balance sheets at face-value.
On the Appeal it was submitted
that on proper scrutiny the tax returns and balance sheets give rise to
unanswered queries. The
submission is entirely correct. However, the matters
should have been pursued at first instance. The Director might have provided
innocent explanation. Whomsoever might bear the onus on an issue such as this,
it is too late to raise potentially answerable
questions at the stage of an
appeal on the record.
I dismiss the Appeal.
