Legal principles

have been considered by the Court of Appeal on numerous occasions. Recently,
the principles were
outlined by the Court of Appeal in
Keremestevski v Shaun
McLeod as executor of the estate of Mark Adrian
I adopt those principles without repeating them.
summary, the court must engage in the following two‑stage process when
considering a claim under
(1) the first stage is to determine whether the claimant was left without
adequate provision for his or her proper maintenance, support,
education or
advancement in life - this is referred to as the jurisdictional question;

the exercise of the court's discretion to make an order

claims on his
undertaking the second stage assessment, in relation to claims by a spouse
(including a de facto spouse) there is a general rule
(which is flexible
depending upon the circumstances, nature and length of the relationship) that a
spouse is entitled to have a home,
income to enable them to live in the style to
which they are accustomed, and to provide them with a fund to meet unforeseen
contingencies.
Disposition
Ms Crothers
was born in Surrey, England on 25 April 1960 and is now 64 years of
age. She has been an Australian citizen since 1982.
Ms Crothers
met the Deceased in late December 2014. They were in a continuous de facto
relationship from about February 2015 to
the date of his death on 4 July
to his relationship with Ms Crothers, the Deceased had three children. The
second, third and fourth defendants are these children.
Deceased had no other children during his lifetime. The second, third and
fourth defendants have made no claim for further provision
in the proceedings
and there is no other person who has a statutory right to make a claim pursuant
to the Act.
Ms Crothers
works as a school teacher. At the time of the Deceased's death and in the
financial year of 2023 ‑ 2024, she earned
an annual taxable
income of $72,375 (approximately $1,390 per week). As at 30 January 2025,
Ms Crothers estimates her weekly expenditure
is $1,084.96. This leaves her
with a surplus of approximately $305 per week.
at 30 January 2025, Ms Crothers estimates that her total assets are
$1,149,007.30, including her half share of the Roman Road
Property and her
property in Sussex Street. Ms Crothers estimates her total liabilities are
$199,275.30, which is comprised of a
mortgage and credit card debt.
Deceased's net estate, as at 4 July 2024, was valued at approximately
$519,084.74. The half share of the Roman Road Property
was valued at $280,000.
On 3 November 2025, the net value of the Deceased's estate was $495,342.80
with the half share of the Roman
Road Property valued at $347,000.
Ms Crothers
plans to sell her house on Sussex Street and pay off the mortgage over that
property. She has three children from her
previous marriage. Her daughter
Katie and Katie's 6‑year‑old son live in the Sussex Street house.
Katie is not currently
am satisfied that, in considering the first stage of the process, the Will
failed to make adequate provision for Ms Crothers as
at the date of the
Deceased's death. I am so satisfied, having regard to:
(1) Ms Crothers' age and her needs;
(2) the modest size of the Deceased's estate;
(3) the nature and length of the relationship between the Deceased and
Ms Crothers; and
(4) the nature of the competing claims on the Deceased's
therefore turn to the second stage of the process.
Ms Crothers
has type 2 diabetes and suffers complications from the condition that require
medication and monitoring. Ms Crothers
also has diabetic retinopathy - an
eye condition - for which she takes eye drop medication. Ms Crothers has
had three operations
for endophthalmitis.
my view, Ms Crothers does not have an adequate buffer for contingencies
given she is 64 years old and her remaining working life
diminishing.
Deceased's estate is modest in size.
Deed provides that Ms Crothers receives the Deceased's half of the Roman
Road Property, in exchange for Ms Crothers paying the
Deceased's estate
$150,000. The effect of this is that Ms Crothers has a secure place of
residence and, as at 3 November 2025, a
net increase in her assets of
am of the view that this provision will provide Ms Crothers with a degree
of financial security, will permit her to continue to
live the lifestyle she and
the Deceased had shared together during their relationship and that it will
provide her with a buffer
to meet any unexpected contingencies.
am satisfied that, in the exercise of my discretion, it is proper to make orders
in the terms sought by the parties so as to make
adequate provision for
Ms Crothers' proper maintenance, support, education or advancement in life
of the Act.
Conclusion and orders
these reasons, I make orders in terms of the memorandum of consent orders filed
9 October 2025.
certify that the preceding paragraph(s) comprise the reasons for decision of the
Supreme Court of Western Australia.
