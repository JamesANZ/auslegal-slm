REASONS FOR THE ORDER OF THE COMMISSIONER OF TENANCIES
INQUIRY - Tuesday, 12 May 2015
LUKE STAPLEDON (‘landlord’)
O'NEIL RAMSAY AND MICHAEL NICHOLSON
(‘tenants’)
RT1415-0580
This is a determination of an application by the landlord dated 9 March 2015
in respect of premises being 10 Doody Street, Bellamack
in the Northern
Territory of Australia (‘the premises’), seeking an order under the
Residential Tenancies Act
(NT) (‘the Act’) as follows:
compensation
under section 122.
A Notice of Inquiry dated 23 March 2015 was
posted to the parties. The Inquiry was conducted on Tuesday, 12 May 2015. The
appeared at the Inquiry and made submissions:
Daby and Ms Collins of Call2View Real Estate on behalf of the landlord; and
tenants Mr Ramsay and Mr Nicholson.
The evidence before the
Inquiry consisted of the following materials:
documents submitted by the landlord in support of the application and kept
under tab on the Commissioner of Tenancies file numbered
RT1415-0580;
documents submitted by the tenants in response to the application and kept under
tab on the file;
following additional materials received by me at the Inquiry and marked as such
on the file:
agreement for the period 23/5/13 to 22/5/14; and
invoices for the periods 22/5/13 to 20/8/13, 21/8/13 to 18/11/13, 19/11/13 to
14/2/14, 15/2/14 to 19/5/14, 20/5/14 to 20/8/14
and 21/8/14 to 20/11/14;
oral evidence of the parties.
On the basis of the above evidence
I find there is a tenancy agreement between the landlord and the tenants in
respect of the premises
within the meaning of and subject to the provisions of
the Act. The key details of the tenancy agreement are as follows:
Duration: Period 1 - Fixed term commencing 23/5/13 and ending 22/5/14;
Period 2 - Fixed term commencing 22/5/14 and ending 20/5/15.
Rent: Period 1 - $1,540.00 per fortnight payable
fortnightly in
advance; and
Period 2 - $1,580.00 per fortnight payable
fortnightly in
Security Deposit $3.080.00
The application for compensation
The landlord is seeking compensation for excess water usage by the tenants
over the term of their first tenancy and for the period
of their second tenancy
up to the last PWC invoice for the period ending 20/11/14.
The landlord’s claim is based on clause 2(B) of the tenancy agreement
(which is identical in respect of both tenancy periods)
which requires the
tenants to pay all charges for water usage in excess of 500 kiloliters per year
or for a pro rata period.
The tenants were sent three invoices by Call2View Real Estate on 15 December
2014 as follows:
23/5/13 to 21/5/14 for consumption of 547KL and totaling $778.86;
20/5/14 to 20/8/14 for consumption of 27KL and totaling $49.05 (of which $20.00
has been paid by the tenants); and
21/8/14 to 20/11/14 for consumption of 344KL and totaling
The landlord is seeking compensation in the amount of
During the course of the Inquiry the landlord’s agents acknowledged a
calculation error in the first invoice. Consumption should
have been 438KL and
the invoice total should have been $751.09.
The landlord’s revised compensation claim is therefore $1,405.02.
The premises was newly constructed when the tenants took up occupancy on
23/5/13. The irrigation system was installed at the time
the property was
constructed.
Both tenants work shift work with one working at intra-Territory
Mr Ramsay advised that approximately three months after moving in to the
premises his daughter brought to his attention the fact that
the irrigation
system was running “...about 5 times throughout the night, seven days per
Not having been in a premises with an irrigation system before, Mr Ramsay
stated that he was unsure if this frequency was normal so
took the approach of
monitoring the situation.
It then became apparent that the drainage system at the property was unable
to cope with the excess amount of water accumulating from
both rain and the
impact of the irrigation system.
This was reported to Call2View on or before the second property inspection in
late December 2013. A Call2View agent attended the property
and took photographs
of the areas in which water was accumulating. Having heard nothing more from the
agents after several weeks,
Mr Ramsay emailed the agents on 17 January 2014,
attaching a series of photographs to the email of the problem areas.
The agents responded on 20 January 2014 advising that the tenant’s
email had been forwarded to the owner. The email also asked
if the irrigation
system had been turned off.
As a consequence of this email, Mr Ramsay turned the irrigation system
A representative from Overlander Homes (the building company that built the
premises) attending in January 2014 to look at the irrigation
system (presumably
as it was still under some form of warranty). The representative claimed that a
number of sprinkler heads had
been damaged by a dog. This representative did not
appear to have made any changes to the settings on the irrigation system.
The tenants’ evidence was that they did not acquire a dog until 1
August 2014 some 9 months after the problems with the irrigation
system were
brought to the agents’ attention.
It was common ground at the Inquiry that the irrigation system settings were
not altered until late February 2015 when a technician
attended the premises and
erased the existing settings and reset the start and finishing times.
I was advised that the irrigation system is now operating effectively
following this action.
At the Inquiry I asked why all three invoices were not sent to the tenants
until 15 December 2014. The agents responded that the landlord
had not been
receiving invoices from Power and Water and it was not until a water restrictor
was applied to the water metre on the
premises by Power and Water for
non-payment of water bills that the landlord took action to ascertain why he
wasn’t receiving
invoices. As it turns out Power and Water had been
sending the invoices to an incorrect address.
I also noted the provisions of clause 3(F) of the tenancy agreement (page 5
of 7) which states:
“(F) RETICULATION – to provide the tenant with complete care and
maintenance instructions by a professional gardening
company. Reticulation to be
professionally inspected at the commencement of the lease, at the Owners
I enquired if the tenants had been provided with “complete care and
maintenance instructions by a professional gardening company”.
parties stated that this
On the basis of the evidence before me I find that the excess water usage at
the premises was due primarily to the irrigation system
I find that the tenants should not be held accountable for the excess water
usage over the periods in question which form the basis
of the landlord’s
claim for compensation.
The tenants drew the problem to the landlord’s agents’ attention
as soon as it became known in December 2013 and the problem
rectified until January 2015.
I also note that the tenants were not provided with the instructions required
under the tenancy agreement regarding the irrigation
system so could not be
assumed to be familiar with the functioning of the system or how to alter the
The issue of damage to the irrigation system by the tenants’ dog is
clearly not established in the timeframe in question.
I am also mindful of the decision in
Taranellos and McCann v Ward
the Tribunal only allowed the landlord to recover the last quarter’s
excess water charges from the tenants on the basis
the landlord had an implied
duty to provide these accounts to the tenants and demand payment as the bills
were received. Even if
it wasn’t for the evidence regarding the faulty
irrigation system I would have been inclined to not allow the landlord’s
application for compensation for similar reasons for the invoices in respect of
the periods 23/5/13 to 21/5/14 and 20/5/14 to 20/8/14.
I do not believe that the tenants should be responsible for the
landlord’s difficulties with Power and Water. It is somewhat
that the landlord did not make the effort to follow up with Power and Water why
he wasn’t receiving water invoices
for the premises soon after the first
quarter had past.
Accordingly, I order that:
application is dismissed.
