Age pension: assets test; treatment of loan
SECRETARY to the DSS and CARAPETA
Decided: 17th December 2013 by Marshall J
The issue was whether the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) applied the
Social Security Act 1991
(the Act) correctly to arrive at the rate of
pension to which the Carapetas were entitled. In particular, the correct
application
of the ‘assets test’ provided for in the Act was at
The Carapetas resided in Portugal and were in receipt of age pension pursuant
to the agreement between Australia and Portugal. They
borrowed 436,225.70 Euro
from a bank and loaned it to a company controlled by them called ‘Teles
Martins & Carapeta, LTD’
(the company). The Department’s Complex
Assessment Officer treated the loan to the company as a personal financial asset
the Carapetas and applied a reduced rate of pension. The Department’s
Authorised Review Officer (ARO) affirmed that decision
and the Social Security
Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) affirmed the ARO’s decision.
The AAT then set aside the SSAT decision.
Legislative context
The Act deals with the application of the ‘assets test’ at
s.1064. Under s.1118 of the Act some assets, but not loans,
disregarded in calculating the value of a person’s assets. Section 1121 of
the Act deals with the effect of charges
and encumbrances on assets.
The Act also deals with loans made by a person. Section 1122 states that:
If a person lends an amount after 27 October 1986, the value of the assets of
the person for the purposes of this Act includes so
much of that amount as
remains unpaid but does not include any amount payable by way of interest under
AAT reasoning
The AAT held that the source of the loan was a bank and therefore s.1121 of
the Act allows for an adjustment of the value of the asset
by including the
value of the encumbrance on it. The AAT noted that reading s.1122 with s.1118
would indicate that the amount of
an unpaid loan should be included in the value
of the assets. However, the AAT said that, due to ‘the fact that the loan
were borrowed as personal loans by the Carapetas from their bank, the sum
of the loan was never an asset in their hands’.
Contentions
The Secretary argued that s.1122 deals with loans made by a person and that
no distinction is made as to the source of funds for those
loans. Section 1121,
on the other hand, is a general provision dealing with a charge or encumbrance
on an asset such that the person’s
equity in the asset is reduced by the
charge or encumbrance.
The Secretary further argued that the AAT did not state with precision what
it considered was the relevant charge for s.1121 of the
The Secretary also raised arguments about the nature of the loan from the
Carapetas to the company. There was no evidence that the
loan to the company was
secured and thereby subject to a charge or encumbrance. In effect, there was no
evidence of the company’s
obligation to repay the loan.
The Carapetas agreed with the AAT reasoning and argued that if the AAT erred,
it was only in fact and not as to law. The Carapetas
argued that the
Secretary’s contentions would result in an ‘absurd or
irrational’ result.
The Secretary also raised a second legal issue alleging that the Secretary
was denied procedural fairness at the AAT. The Court did
not deal with this
issue given its finding on the first issue.
Consideration
The Court upheld the appeal. There was no evidence before the AAT which
showed that the sum loaned to the company was obtained by
the Carapetas via
secured loans from the bank. Therefore, there was no basis to apply s.1121
regarding a charge or encumbrance. In
any event, s.1122 read with s.1121 applies
to make so much of the loan advanced to the company as remains unpaid an asset
Finally, the Court considered that the Carapetas ‘lent money to a
corporation which is their alter ego. In effect, they lent
money to themselves.
There is nothing absurd or rational about the loan being treated as their
Formal decision
The Court set aside the decision of the AAT and remitted the matter back to
be heard in accordance with law. No order as to costs.
