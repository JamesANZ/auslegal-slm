Adjustment of lot entitlements for Contribution Schedule – decision

REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
application, filed 3 July 2009, seeks an adjustment of the lot entitlements for
the Contribution Schedule for the community titles
scheme known as “The
Gums Anchorage” Community Titles Scheme 9677 (“CTS”). It was
brought pursuant to
Body Corporate and Community Management
(“BCCM Act”), as facilitated by
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act 2003
(“CCT Act”).
applicants are the owners of Lot 42 in this CTS.
required by section 48(2) of the BCCM Act, the respondent is the Body Corporate
of this CTS.
Defence filed by the respondent on 16 July 2009 merely states that the Body
Corporate considered this matter at its AGM on 30
May 2009 and, of the 33 votes
cast, 10 votes only were in favour of the proposal that the lot entitlements be
5 August 2009 the Tribunal ordered that, pending certain steps to be taken by
the parties, the application may be determined by
the Tribunal “
”, if possible.
the applicants and the respondent have now consented to the Tribunal determining
this proceeding on the papers.
Relevant legislation
48 of the CCT Act states that the Tribunal may decide all of a proceeding from a
consideration of the documents filed, without
the parties or witnesses
appearing, if the parties to the proceeding agree: see paragraph (a).
far as the application for adjustment is concerned, the relevant provisions of
the BCCM Act are contained in Part 5 of Chapter
2 of that Act.
47, by section 47(1), of the BCCM Act states the general principles for the
application of lot entitlements to a CTS such
as this, but has effect subject of
the provisions of the BCCM Act providing more specifically to the application of
lot entitlements.
Section 47(2) then states that the contribution schedule lot
entitlement for a lot is the basis for calculating –
(a) the lot owner’s share of amounts levied by the body
corporate, unless the extent of the lot owner’s obligation to
to a levy for a particular purpose is specifically otherwise provided for in the
BCCM Act; and
(b) the value of the lot owner’s vote for voting on an ordinary
resolution if a poll is conducted for voting on the resolution.
relevant part of section 48 of the BCCM Act starts with section 48(5). It
requires the order of the Tribunal to be consistent
with, if the order is about
the contribution schedule, the principles stated in section 48(6): see
paragraph (a). Thus, it is necessary
to consider that provision. Section 48(6)
states that the respective lot entitlements “
” to the extent to which it is just
and equitable in the circumstances for them not to be equal.
49 of the BCCM Act sets up criteria for deciding such just and equitable
circumstances. While section 49(3) states that the
matters that the Tribunal
may have regard to are not limited to the matters stated in section 49, section
49(4) states that the Tribunal
may have regard to –
(a) how the community title scheme is structured;
(b) the nature, features and characteristics of the lots included in the
scheme; and
(c) the purposes for which the lots are used.
Furthermore,
section 49(5) states the Tribunal may
have regard to any knowledge or
understanding the applicant had, or any lack of knowledge or misunderstanding on
the part of the
applicant, at the time the applicant entered into a contract to
buy the lot owned by the applicant, about –
(a) the lot entitlement of the subject lot or other lots included
in the community titles scheme; and
(b) the purpose for which a lot entitlement is used.
Importantly,
section 48(10) states that if the Tribunal orders an adjustment of a lot
entitlement schedule, the body corporate must,
as quickly as practicable, lodge
a request to record a new community management statement reflecting the
adjustment ordered.
Relevant authority
Court of Appeal in
Fischer v Body Corporate for Centrepoint Community Titles
Scheme 7779
[2004] QCA 214
[2004] 2 Qd R 638
set out the following principles and
approaches:
a contribution
schedule should provide for “
equal contributions
owners, except insofar as some lots can be “
rise to a particular cost to the body corporate which other lots do not: at 644
considerations of “
amenity, value or history
” are to be
disregarded because what is at issue is the equitable distribution of the costs:
at 644 [26];
Example 3 in the
Explanatory Notes relevant to the 2003 Amending Act shows that, in a basic
scheme, if all lots are residential lots
ranging in size “
from a small
lot to a penthouse
”, the contribution schedule lot entitlements
generally would be equal
”, and lots in the scheme, despite
of different size or aspect would be expected to have equal
contribution schedule lot entitlements
”: at 644-645 [28];
the starting
point for an adjustment is that entitlements should be equal, with a departure
from that principle being allowed only
where it is just, or fair, to recognise
inequality, and with the focus of the inquiry being the extent to which a lot
unequally causes
” costs to the body corporate: at 645 [31];
section 49 of
the BCCM Act, and in particular section 49(4), should be construed as meaning
that those identified matters to which
a court may have regard are to be
to the extent, if any, that they affect the “cost of
operating” a community titles scheme: at 646 [33].
application has attached to it the Budget Summary dated 31 March 2008. From it,
it can be discerned that the lot entitlements
for all lots other than Lots 4, 8,
42 and 46 have the same entitlement (namely, “1”), whereas the
remaining lots had
a lot entitlement of “2”, in the Contribution
is also clear from that Attachment that this particular CTS was developed before
the 2003 Amending Act which brought into effect
those provisions in section 46
which also require that, for the contribution schedule for a scheme for which a
development approval
is given after the commencement of that Act, the respective
lot entitlements “
must be equal
the extent to which it is just and equitable in the circumstances for them not
to be equal.
Attachment also states that while Lot 42 is a larger unit, the rights that the
owners, or occupiers, have to the use of the facilities
and amenities in the
common property of the CTS are exactly the same as other Lots. Finally,
regarding basic facts, the Attachment
states that there is not attached to Lot
42 any special or extra entitlements; and Lot 42 does not require a larger
proportion of
the resources of the Body Corporate.
claim (in the Statement of Claim for the application) is that the adjustment to
the lot entitlements ensure that all Lots contribute

has been no additional evidence sought to be led by either party, apart from
some photographs – which the Tribunal has
considered to be uncontentious
– attached to a letter of the applicants dated 13 August 2009 wherein they
consent to the Tribunal
determining the application on the papers.
Consideration
Tribunal has taken those photographs as shown simply that the CTS land has
constructed on it various buildings containing the
various Lots and that there
are facilities, such as a swimming pool and lawn areas, which are part of the
common property of the
the vote at the AGM of 30 May 2009, it is irrelevant for present purposes not
only because it is part of the “
” – which is to
disregarded
” in accordance with
but because, unless a resolution without dissent is passed, there is no other
method of seeking an adjustment of the lot
entitlements in the Contribution
Schedule apart from bringing an application such as this. On bringing such an
application, the
Tribunal applies the provisions of the legislation in question;
and it is irrelevant to that consideration what other lot owners
may have done
in terms of voting at any particular AGM, or EGM. This is because such a vote
does not put before the Tribunal relevant
evidentiary facts upon which the
Tribunal can make a decision, one way or the other, as how the application
should be decided.
there is uncontested evidence that the present lot entitlements are not equal
and since there is uncontested evidence that there
is nothing in the nature of
the Lots in this CTS which show that the Lots having twice the lot entitlements
of the remaining lots
unequally cause
” costs to the body
corporate, there is no basis upon which to depart from the principles enunciated
in section 48(6) of the
BCCM Act concerning equality, because there is nothing
in the circumstances which shows that it is just and equitable for the lot
entitlements “
not to be equal
existence of section 48 is, thus, complementary to section 47 in that it permits
schemes which were the subject of development
approvals given before the
commencement of the Amending Act in 2003 to apply to the Tribunal to have an
adjustment so that the scheme
can now reflect the statutory obligation that
applies to a scheme for which a development approval is given after the
commencement
of the Amending Act.
Consequences
the Tribunal has decided that it is an appropriate proceeding in which a
decision can be made from a consideration of the documents
filed, without the
parties or witnesses appearing, that an adjustment should be ordered.
Consequently,
the Tribunal will order that the lot entitlements for each and every lot in the
Contribution Schedule for this CTS be
adjusted so that the respective lot
entitlements for all lots in this CTS be equal. Given the obligation pursuant
to section 46(6)
of the BCCM Act that the lot entitlement must be a whole
number, but must not be zero, and given that section 47(2)(b) states that
contribution schedule lot entitlement for a lot is the basis for calculating the
value of the lot owner’s vote for voting
on an ordinary resolution if a
poll is conducted for voting on the resolution, the rational outcome is that the
number allocated
to each and every lot should be the figure “1”.
the provisions of section 70 of the CCT Act state that the main purpose of the
cost provisions is to have the parties pay their
own costs unless the interests
of justice require otherwise, and given relevant authority in this area, it is
inevitable in a proceeding
such as this that there should be no order as to
