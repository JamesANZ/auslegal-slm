Applicant: Deacons Lawyers
Respondent: Trilby Misso
[1] FRYBERG J: The parties have made submissions in writing regarding costs
pursuant to leave granted when judgment was delivered
by the Tribunal on
27 March 2009.
[2] The Commissioner has submitted that because Mr Scott
has been found guilty of unprofessional conduct on two occasions and
professional
misconduct on two other occasions, and because there are no
exceptional circumstances in the case, the Tribunal is obliged by
Legal Profession Act 2007
to order costs in his favour. He has made no
alternative submission regarding the proper exercise of any
discretion.
[3] Mr Scott has submitted that there is a proper basis for an
order for costs in his favour; and that in the light of the other orders
have been made, the imposition of the costs order would result in a very heavy
impost which is neither necessary nor reasonable
circumstances.
Section 462
disciplinary body must make an order requiring a person whom it has found guilty
to pay costs, including costs of the
commissioner and the complainant, unless
the disciplinary body is satisfied exceptional circumstances exist.
(4) A disciplinary body may make an order requiring the commissioner to pay
costs, but may do so only if it is satisfied that –
(a) the Australian legal practitioner or law practice employee is not guilty;
(b) the body considers that special circumstances warrant the making of the

means guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct or
professional misconduct, or of misconduct in relation to a relevant practice,
mentioned in section 4561(1) or
[5] The application was filed on 10 April 2007. It related to events which
occurred between 1999 and 2004, most of them before the
Legal Profession Act
came into force. The evidence does not disclose when a complaint was made
to the Commissioner. The application contained what were
apparently intended to
be eight charges which were particularised over 17 pages. A large number of
affidavits were filed in support
of the application. Mr Scott contested the
application and filed affidavits in support of his position.
[6] The first
charge was headed “Misleading the Federal Court of Australia and
others”. It related to representations
in documents filed in that
All but one of the allegations were
admitted. The allegation not admitted was that the representations “were
intended to
mislead members of the AGS [sic]”.
[7] The second charge
was headed “Acting for Theresa Tate in conflict with his duties to former
clients”, a heading which
sufficiently describes its nature. That is also
true of the third charge, headed “Acting for Theresa Tate in proceedings
which he had reason to believe he was likely to be a witness”. The
fourth, headed “Misleading the Queensland Law Society
-- ceasing to act
for Tate”, contained an assertion that information provided by Mr Scott to
the Society was misleading and
deceptive. Mr Scott did not admit any of these
[8] The fifth charge was headed “Misuse of privileged and/or
confidential information”. It alleged that Mr Scott provided
Ms Tate with
five classes of such information. He did not admit providing any information to
[9] The sixth charge was headed “Misleading Clewett Corser &
Drummond -- preservation of client privilege and confidentiality”.
alleged that a statement in a letter written by Mr Scott to that firm was
misleading and deceptive. That was not admitted by
seventh charge alleged that Mr Scott procured Tate and her partner Mr Moore to
establish and maintain a website to which
he posted material of an
unprofessional character, for the purposes of recovering legal fees and
disbursements claimed by his firm.
The eighth, headed “Misleading the
Queensland Law Society -- www.asglies.com”, alleged that he misled the
Society regarding
his procurement or encouragement of Tate and Moore to set up
the website and regarding the fact that he substantially drafted or
assisted to
settle the material posted to the website. Mr Scott did not admit these
allegations.
[11] When the application came on for hearing in August 2008 the
Commissioner sought and was granted leave to file an amended application.
main amendments were the deletion of the third charge and a major scaling back
of the allegations relied on in support of the
second. In charge six an
alternative allegation of encouragement was added to the charge of procurement.
At the outset Mr Scott
successfully applied for the sixth charge to be struck
out. That left in substance five of the original charges and one greatly
back charge. In two of those five, further particulars were ordered.
[12] The Commissioner then opened his case. In the course of the opening a
number of deficiencies in his case were identified and
counsel undertook to
examine these as soon as possible. Five witnesses were required by Mr Scott for
cross-examination. The first
witness was still under cross-examination when the
Tribunal adjourned for the day. Counsel expected cross-examination to continue
for some time.
[13] When the Tribunal resumed the next day, counsel for the
Commissioner informed it that following discussions between the parties,
amended application would be prepared and filed, no further evidence would be
called and the matter would proceed by way of a
plea of guilty to the amended
charges. The parties sought the adjournment of the application until the
following day to enable this
to be done. That adjournment was
[14] On the third day the Commissioner sought leave to file and
serve the amended application and leave was granted. As amended the
application
contained only four charges. In the first (misleading the Federal Court) the
former allegation of intention to mislead
was withdrawn. In the second (misuse of
privilege and/or confidential information) the classes of information the
subject of the
charge were reduced from five to two. In the third (maintaining
the asglies website) the allegation that Mr Scott procured the establishment
maintenance of the website was withdrawn, leaving only the allegation (first
made only two days earlier) of encouraging those
activities; and an allegation
that he did so for the purpose of recovering his fees and disbursements was also
withdrawn. In the
fourth (misleading the Queensland Law Society regarding that
website) corresponding amendments were made and an allegation that Mr
substantially drafted or assisted in settling material on the website was also
[15] In consequence the ambit of the evidence was reduced. I have
set out in my earlier judgment the evidence which was ultimately
[16] I reject Mr Scott's submission
that there is a proper basis for an order for costs in his favour. The power to
make such an
order depends upon a finding of not guilty. No such finding has
Section 462(1)
requires the Tribunal in unexceptional
circumstances to make an order requiring the guilty person to pay costs. It
does not specify
the amount of costs which must be ordered nor the basis on
which the amount must be decided. Those matters are left to the discretion
the Tribunal:
Nor does the section identify in respect of what
the costs must be ordered. However in Baker v Legal Services
Commissioner,
McPherson JA, with whom Jerrard
JA and Douglas J agreed, wrote:
“In my view ... the criterion adopted in
is whether the
practitioner has been found guilty of one or more of the forms of misconduct
specified in
If he has, then an order requiring him to pay costs
must be made against him unless the Tribunal is satisfied that
‘exceptional
circumstances’ exist. It is true that
refers simply to ‘costs’ and not to all the costs of the
proceedings; but the latter is I consider its primary meaning
in this context.
Section 286(1)
is not designed to confer or preserve the broad discretion over
costs commonly found in statutory provisions conferring power to
award costs.
If it had been intended to do so, it could and would have been expressed to that
effect. On the contrary, the mandatory
rule imposed by
designed to follow unless the Tribunal is satisfied that exceptional
circumstances exist that call for some other order to be
made, either generally
or in terms of an amount under
s 286(5)(a)
or (b) or against the
Commissioner under
[18] That passage was technically obiter dictum. Moreover it is not completely
clear what his Honour meant by “its primary
meaning”, nor what other
meanings might be available. It is unlikely that this passage represents the
last word of the Court
of Appeal on this question. The section could quite
naturally be read in such a way that “costs” did not cover costs
incurred in relation to charges not proceeded with and, perhaps, charges
substantially transformed at a late stage of proceedings.
Nonetheless, it
covers the present case and I do not consider that, sitting as the Tribunal, I
should not apply it.
[19] The Act does not identify what is meant by
“exceptional”. The Commissioner relied on a passage from
Attorney-General
for the State of Queensland v
“The issue of what are exceptional circumstances in a particular case
is one that depends on judicial determination. It is
fruitless to attempt to
define what exceptional circumstances might be but a practical working approach
to it is to be found in the
following passage from
R v Kelly (Edward)
[1999] UKHL 4
[2000] QB 198
at 208, where Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ had to construe the
term in a statutory context. He said:
‘We must construe ‘exceptional’ as an ordinary, familiar
English adjective, and not as a term of art. It describes
a circumstance which
is such as to form an exception, which is out of the ordinary course, or
unusual, or special, or uncommon.
To be exceptional a circumstance need not be
unique, or unprecedented, or very rare; but it cannot be one that is regularly,
or routinely,
or normally
encountered’.”
Although that was said in relation to different legislation, I am prepared to
apply it in the present context.
[20] In this case, at a very late stage, the Commissioner withdrew three of the
eight charges, and a fourth was struck out. Of the
four charges which remained,
the allegation of intentional misleading was withdrawn from the first; the
nature and amount of information
misused was substantially reduced in the
second; in the third, the allegation of procurement was replaced by an
allegation of encouragement
and the allegation that Mr Scott acted for the
purpose of recovering fees and disbursements was withdrawn; and in the last,
to procurement was withdrawn and the allegation relating to drafting
or settling material was replaced by one relating to reviewing
evidence was placed before me which would enable me to make an evidence-based
finding about whether such circumstances form
an ordinary part of proceedings in
the Tribunal. My own experience in the Tribunal is too limited for me to take
judicial notice
of the frequency of any such circumstances. However it is I
think reasonable for me to apply a presumption of regularity. I presume
change of tack on the part of the Commissioner of the nature and magnitude as
occurred in this case is an extraordinary event
in proceedings in the Tribunal,
and is not something which “is regularly, or routinely, or normally
encountered”.
In my judgment the
present proceedings fall within the exception to s 462(1).
does not mean that no order for costs should be made against Mr Scott. It
simply means that the Tribunal is not bound to
order him to pay all of the
Commissioner's costs of the whole proceedings. In my judgment he should pay the
Commissioner's costs
to the extent that they were incurred in relation to
matters upon which the application was successful. That would include the costs
of preparing and filing the further amended application upon which the case
ultimately proceeded, costs relating to the evidence
used on that amended
application, costs of the third day of the hearing and costs of the
supplementary submissions sought by and
made to the Tribunal. Those costs
should be assessed as if incurred for a Supreme Court trial on the standard
[23] The orders of the Tribunal will be:
1. Order that the respondent pay the applicant's costs to the extent to which
they were incurred in relation to matters upon which
the application was
successful.
2. Order that such costs be determined as if incurred for a
Supreme Court trial and assessed on the standard basis.
