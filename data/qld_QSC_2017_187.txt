SOLICITORS:
Thomson Geer for the applicant
Clayton Utz for the respondent
[1] The applicant conducts a child care centre in Brisbane and sought a decision
from the regulatory authority to grant a “service
waiver” to relax
the space requirement which would then permit it to provide care for a greater
number of children. The respondent
was the delegate of the regulatory
authority, duly authorized to make the decision in respect of the application.
[2] The respondent refused the application. Pursuant to the
Judicial Review
(Qld), the applicant brought an application for review and an
application for a statutory order of review, with a view to having
respondent’s decision set aside.
[3] My judgment on the application was published on 28 July
I ordered that the
respondent’s decision be set aside with effect from the date it was made.
[4] It is now necessary to resolve a dispute between the parties as to the order
which should be made in relation to the costs of
the proceeding.
[5] The applicant submits that, pursuant to r 681 of the
Uniform Civil
Procedure Rules
costs should follow the event, unless I
otherwise order. It submits that there are no circumstances justifying any
other order.
Accordingly, it seeks an order that the respondent should pay its
costs of and incidental to the proceeding to be assessed on the
standard basis,
if not agreed.
[6] The respondent accepts that there should be a costs order against her.
However she seeks to persuade me to exercise the jurisdiction
conferred on me by
r 684 of the UCPR to order that she should only be required to pay 75% of the
applicant’s costs of and incidental
to the proceeding to be assessed on
the standard basis, if not agreed.
[7] First, the respondent submitted that a 5% reduction in costs should be made
to take into account costs associated with the original
joinder of the second
respondent. She contended that the second respondent was improperly joined and
was only removed from the proceeding
at a very late stage. The submission that
those circumstances warrant the reduction sought must be rejected. Having
regard to the
observations which I made in my judgment at [74]-[76], I agree
with the applicant’s submission that it is to be doubted that
respondent was improperly joined. However, and more importantly for present
purposes, I also agree with the applicant’s
(a) a notice of
discontinuance was filed by consent on 24 November 2016 which was the day before
the hearing;
(b) r 307(1)
already operates to render the applicant liable to pay the then second
respondent’s costs up to the discontinuance;
(c) accordingly,
there is no case for the making of the proposed reduction in the costs which the
respondent (originally the first
respondent) must pay in consequence of losing
the application.
[8] Second, the respondent submitted that a 20% reduction in costs should be
made to take into account the facts that:
applicant only succeeded on one of the substantive grounds of review in the
application; and
applicant twice amended the application during the course of the hearing, with
the result that the applicant ought to pay
the respondent’s costs thrown
away by the amendments.
[9] In effect the respondent asks me to make a global judgment that those two
considerations ought mitigate what would otherwise
be her liability to pay
costs, and ought to do so to the extent of 20%.
[10] In order to deal with the first part of this argument, it is necessary
briefly to explain the way in which the application was
resolved by me in my
judgment of 28 July 2017.
[11] The grounds for the challenge of the decision which were pursued before me
(a) breach of
the rules of natural justice;
(b) failure to
take into account relevant considerations;
(c) taking into
account irrelevant considerations; and
errors of law in the form of misconstruction of particular legislative
provisions.
[12] As to the alleged breaches of the rules of natural justice:
(a) I found
that there had been two breaches of the hearing
and that those breaches
justified my acceptance of the applicant’s contention that the decision
should be set aside with effect
from the date it was
I rejected one further
argument as to breach of the hearing
(b) I rejected
the applicant’s submission that the respondent demonstrated actual bias by
way of prejudgment prior to making
I also rejected the
applicant’s contention that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on
behalf of the respondent.
[13] As to the alleged failure to take into account relevant considerations, the
applicant had developed a submission that the respondent
had made a fundamental
error in her apprehension of the nature of the application. I rejected that
submission on the basis that
misconceived.
[14] As to the alleged taking into account of irrelevant
considerations:
(a) I rejected
the first allegedly irrelevant consideration because I accepted the
respondent’s evidence that it was not taken
(b) I rejected
the second allegedly irrelevant
consideration
because I thought
that either:
(i) the breadth
of considerations which were relevant was such that it could not be said that it
was erroneous to take the subject
consideration into account in the limited way
in which the respondent had; or
(ii) if I was
wrong in reaching that view, the materiality of the consideration was not such
as would require a remedy.
(c) I rejected
the third allegedly irrelevant consideration because it was not an irrelevant
consideration. I thought the vice was
not the fact that it was considered, but
the fact that the applicant was not given the opportunity to address it
specifically.
[15] As to the contention that the decision involved errors of law in the form
of misconstruction of particular legislative provisions,
I agreed with the
respondent’s submissions that there was no proper basis on which it may be
inferred that the decision involved
a misconstruction of any of the identified
provisions.
[16] Each of the arguments on which the applicant was unsuccessful was
essentially an alternative route to the outcome it obtained
by virtue of the
issues on which it was successful. That would not usually warrant a departure
from the general principle that costs
should follow event: cf

[2016] QCA 199
[17] No doubt a shotgun approach to judicial review applications is not to be
encouraged. An applicant who proceeded in such a way,
by advancing a plethora
of separate time-consuming arguments, only one of which eventually found favour
with the court, might well
run the risk of being deprived of a portion of its
costs, or even of being required to pay some part of the respondent’s
[18] However the respondent’s submissions on costs have not sought to
explain by reference to the facts or the time taken in
argument or any other
aspect of how the case was actually conducted why it is that the fact of the
arguments which the applicant
ran and lost warrants the conclusion for which the
respondent has contended.
[19] The respondent has not persuaded me that this consideration warrants any
alteration to the usual order.
[20] As to the second consideration:
applicant noted that the application was amended twice and without opposition:
first at the outset of the hearing (the amendment
having been foreshadowed by
correspondence 2 months earlier) and the second time during the course of
argument (the amendment being
sought as a result of evidence given by the
respondent during cross-examination).
Rule 692(2)
of the UCPR operates so that the applicant is liable to pay the costs thrown
away by the amendments unless the Court orders otherwise.
On each occasion,
leave to make the amendments was granted without objection and without my being
asked to make any order that the
applicant not be liable for costs.
applicant now submits to me that it is likely that there were no costs thrown
away. But that seems to me to be a question
for costs assessment, in the event
that the respondent seeks to enforce the liability created by the operation of r
692. So far
as the question before me is concerned, I agree with the applicant
that the fact that there were two amendments to the application
does not warrant
any alteration to the usual order.
[21] It remains briefly to deal with one further matter.
[22] My judgment of 28 July 2017 was critical of the fact that eight volumes of
documentary evidence comprising thousands of pages
were tendered for the one day
hearing, when the relevant documentary evidence could have been encompassed
within a single volume.
parties’ written submissions on costs touched upon whether there had in
fact been any departure from a practice which
should be regarded as orthodox, or
whether blame should be attributed one way. These submissions are not relevant
to the costs order
I should make, so I will not engage with them. The applicant
did submit that costs of perusal of all the documentation should be
included in
the assessment of its costs of the proceeding, but whether there is any merit in
that submission is a matter for the
costs assessor.
[23] The respondent must pay the applicant’s costs of and incidental to
the proceeding to be assessed on the standard basis,
