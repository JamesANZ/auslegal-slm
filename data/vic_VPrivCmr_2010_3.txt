Complainant AR v Contracted Service Provider to the Department
[2010] VPrivCmr
Disclosure of personal
information
– allegation that the deletion of emails was an
unauthorised use of personal information
Data Security
– allegation that the
Department failed to take reasonable steps to protect the personal information
it held from misuse, loss,
unauthorised access and
modification
_____________________________________________________________________
The Complaint
The Complainant was employed by the Department. The Complainant made a
complaint to another Regulator about the introduction of a
new workplace policy.
The Complainant was subsequently required by the Regulator to provide evidence
to support the complaint.
The Complainant had saved emails and documents that directly related to the
complaint with the Regulator on their work account and
computer. The
Complainant’s work account was password protected, requiring user security
verification to allow account access
and the Complainant was permitted to use
the account, within reason, for personal use. After completing system log in,
the Complainant
noticed certain emails and documents that had previously been
saved had been removed from the system. The Complainant notified the
information shown in the ‘access
logs’, that someone had logged into
and accessed the Complainant’s email account.
The Complainant requested that the emails and documents that had been deleted
be reinstated to the Complainant’s email account.
In light of discovering the missing emails and documents, the Complainant
made an additional and new complaint to the Regulator in
relation to the email
and file deletion, alleging it amounted to victimisation. The Complainant made a
complaint about the same issue
to the Office of the Victorian Privacy
Commissioner (OVPC).
The Complainant alleged that by deleting or removing access to emails
relating to the complaint, the Department had used the Complainant’s
personal information in a way not authorised under Information Privacy Principle
(IPP) 2.1 (Use and Disclosure).
The Complainant also alleged that the Department, in allowing unauthorised
access to the Complainant’s email account, failed
to take reasonable steps
to protect the Complainant’s personal information from misuse, loss,
unauthorised access and modification
within the meaning of IPP 4.1 (Data
Response to the Complaint
The Department argued that, after conducting an investigation, it found that
there was no documentary or technical evidence to support
the claim of
unauthorised access to the Complainant’s email account. Rather, any
alleged deletion must have occurred: due
to the Complainant’s own actions,
such as accidental deletion; or if the Complainant’s password had been
compromised
through a malicious act or disclosed. Consequently, the Department
argued there had been no unauthorised use and requested that
the IPP 2.1 matter
be declined under section 29(1)(e) – that the complaint was lacking in
The Department also believed that it had taken all possible steps to restore
deleted emails from its servers and offered to make arrangements
provision of copies of the emails to be given to the Complainant. The
Department considered the steps taken to recover deleted
documents from back-ups
held by its IT service provider addressed the requirements of IPP 4.1. In the
Department’s view, IPP
4.1 is concerned with guarding against the initial
loss of personal information an agency is obliged to retain and use for business
purposes, as opposed to recovering deleted information, collected by a staff
member for their own private use.
Considering the Department’s interpretation of IPP 4.1 and that their
investigation had not found any unauthorised access to
the Complainant’s
email account, the Department requested that the IPP 4.1 matter be declined
under section 29(1)(a) –
the act or practice is not a breach of
The Department finally argued that the subject matter of the complaint being
dealt with by the Privacy Commissioner had progressed
some way in both the
Regulator and the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) forums,
undergoing mediation and hearing.
In light of this, the Department requested
that the Privacy Commissioner exercise her discretion under section 29(1)(f) of
Information Privacy Act
to decline the complaint, as the act or
practice was the subject of an application under another enactment and the
subject matter
of the complaint was being dealt with adequately under that
The Privacy Commissioner considered that the subject of the
Complainant’s complaint was the same as that brought under another
enactment. Given that the Complainant’s complaint with the Regulator was
scheduled for hearing at VCAT, the Commissioner considered
it inappropriate to
attempt to conciliate the matter and that the complaint was being adequately
dealt with under another enactment.
The Commissioner therefore decided to exercise her discretion to decline to
entertain the complaint under section 29(1)(f) of the
The Complainant did not request to have the complaint referred to VCAT. The
complaint was dismissed.
