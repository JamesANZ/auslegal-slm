Exemption for maternity and adoption leave pay (PT-113) [2005] VICSROPT 1 (1 April 2005)
1. Section 11 of the
Pay-roll Tax Act 1971
(the PRT Act)
exempts from pay-roll tax, wages paid or payable to
employees on maternity leave or adoption leave.
2. The exemption:
applies to wages paid or payable on or after 1
January 2003 to female employees taking
maternity leave and male and female employees
taking adoption leave;
applies to all wages other than fringe benefits;
is limited to a maximum of 14 weeks pay;
applies irrespective of whether the leave is taken
before or after the birth or adoption; and
must be supported by keeping relevant records.
3. The purpose of this ruling is to explain the application of
the exemption for maternity and adoption leave pay and
clarify the elements of the exemption.
Definition of maternity leave � S.11(1)(a) PRT Act
4. Maternity leave is defined in the PRT Act as leave given
to a female employee in connection with her pregnancy
or the birth of her child. Sick leave, recreational leave,
annual leave or any similar leave taken in connection
with a pregnancy or the birth of a child is not considered
as maternity leave for pay-roll tax purposes. For the
purposes of the exemption, the employee can take the
leave before or after the birth.
In relation to the birth of her child, Mary took long
service leave of 10 weeks, annual leave of four weeks
and unpaid leave of 38 weeks. The wages paid for leave
taken by Mary are taxable because the leave is not paid
maternity leave.
On the other hand, if Mary took long service leave of 10
weeks, annual leave of four weeks, paid maternity leave
of 12 weeks and unpaid leave of 26 weeks, the wages
paid for the 12 weeks maternity leave are exempt but
the wages paid for the long service leave and annual
leave are taxable.
5. The exemption does not apply to paternity leave which is
granted to a male employee subsequent to his spouse
(or de facto spouse) giving birth.
Definition of adoption leave � S.11(1)(b) PRT Act
6. Adoption leave refers to leave given to an employee in
connection with the adoption of a child. As with
maternity leave, sick leave, recreational leave, annual
leave or any similar leave taken in relation to the
adoption is not exempt as it is not paid adoption leave.
For the purposes of the exemption, the employee can
take the leave before or after adoption.
John has taken paid adoption leave in three distinct
parts, e.g. one week to familiarise himself with the
adoption process, two weeks to go interstate/overseas to
meet the child and a further three weeks after the child
arrived in Melbourne. All six weeks are considered to be
adoption leave. The wages paid in relation to the adop-
tion leave are exempt because the exemption applies to
leave taken before and after the adoption.
The type of wages that both exemptions exclude
7. The exemption for both maternity and adoption leave
applies to all wages paid to eligible employees other
than fringe benefits. The exempt wages therefore
include wages/salaries, employer superannuation
contributions, allowances, bonuses and commissions.
8. Any fringe benefits provided to an employee taking
maternity or adoption leave are not exempt under this
Maximum entitlement
9. However, for any one pregnancy or adoption, the
exemption is limited to wages for a maximum of 14
weeks full time leave for a full time employee or the
equivalent amount if taken over a longer period e.g. 28
weeks leave being paid at half pay. In the case of a
part-time employee, the exemption is limited to a
maximum of 14 weeks leave paid at the applicable
part-time pay rates.
Cathy, a part-time employee, works 3 days a week
at the rate of $100 per day. The maximum
amount of exempt wages that can be paid to
Cathy is $4,200 i.e. ($100 x 3 x 14).
ABC Pty Ltd has a 12 weeks paid maternity leave
policy. Stella, a full time employee elects to take
the maternity leave over 24 weeks at half pay.
Under the exemption, these wages are fully
Commencement date of exemption
10. Irrespective of when the leave is taken, the wages paid
in respect of the maternity or adoption leave are exempt
only if paid on or after 1 January 2003.
