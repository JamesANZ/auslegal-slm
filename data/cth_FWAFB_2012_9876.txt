JUSTICE ROSS, PRESIDENT
DEPUTY PRESIDENT HAMILTON
COMMISSIONER DEEGAN
MELBOURNE, 22 NOVEMBER 2012
Appeal against decision of Commissioner Lewin
[2012] FWA 8433
- agreement to settle unfair dismissal proceeding - permission to appeal refused.
1. Background
On 4 October 2012 Commissioner Lewin dismissed Kevin Coleman’s unfair dismissal application because, among other things, the
application had no reasonable prospects of success
. The Commissioner’s conclusion was based on his finding that the parties had reached a binding settlement agreement in respect
of that application. At paragraph 14 of his decision the Commissioner said:
“I remain satisfied that Mr Coleman and Logic reached accord and satisfaction during a conciliation conference of 25 January
2012. The terms of settlement, now performed by Logic, constitute a complete answer to the cause of action under
of the Act pursued by Mr Coleman, in the form of an application for relief in relation to the termination of his employment by Logic”
Mr Coleman (the Appellant) has appealed the Commissioner’s decision. The relevant background facts may be briefly stated.
Mr Coleman’s employment with the respondent was terminated on 13 December 2011. Mr Coleman filed an application for an unfair
dismissal remedy on 21 December 2011. A telephone conciliation conference took place on 25 January 2012.
In the proceedings before Commissioner Lewin both parties accepted that an agreement to settle the appellant’s claim was reached
during the conciliation conference. It was also common ground that the parties subsequently signed terms of settlement provided by
Fair Work Australia and that those terms of settlement recorded the agreement reached during the conciliation conference
The terms of settlement reached between the parties was in evidence in the proceedings in first instance before Commissioner Lewin
and marked as exhibit A.
The central issue for determination in the proceedings before the Commissioner was whether there was an agreement to settle the proceedings.
The Commissioner found that there was such an agreement and that the respondent had performed the terms of settlement
. The Commissioner did not deal with the substantive merits of Mr Coleman’s application for relief, and nor is it necessary
to do so on appeal.
2. The Appeal
An appeal under
of the Act is an appeal by way of rehearing and the Tribunal’s powers on appeal are only exercisable if there is error on the
part of the primary decision maker
. There is no right to appeal, rather an appeal may only be made with the permission of the Tribunal.
Section 400
of the Act deals with permission to appeal in relation to appeals concerning applications alleging unfair dismissal, it provides:
400 Appeal rights
(1) Despite
subsection 604(2)
, FWA must not grant permission to appeal from a decision made by FWA under this Part unless FWA considers that it is in the public
interest to do so.
(2) Despite
subsection 604(1)
, an appeal from a decision made by FWA in relation to a matter arising under this Part can only, to the extent that it is an appeal
on a question of fact, be made on the ground that the decision involved a significant error of fact.
The Commissioner’s decision was a decision ‘under this Part’ within the meaning of
and a decision ‘in relation to a matter arising under this Part’ within the meaning of
5_3954" name="P65_3955">6.
Coal & Allied Mining Services Pty Ltd v Lawler and others
, Buchanan J (with whom Marshall and Cowdroy JJ agreed) characterised the test under
as ‘a stringent one’
. The Tribunal
grant permission to appeal
it considers that it is ‘in the public interest to do so’. The task of assessing whether the public interest test is
met is a discretionary one involving a broad value judgment
GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd v Makin
a Full Bench of the Tribunal identified some of the considerations that may attract the public interest:
“... the public interest might be attracted where a matter raises issue of importance and general application, or where there
is a diversity of decisions at first instance so that guidance from an appellate court is required, or where the decision at first
instance manifests an injustice, or the result is counter intuitive or that the legal principles applied appear disharmonious when
compared with other recent decisions dealing with similar matters...”
At first instance the Commissioner was satisfied that there was a binding agreement between the parties. We are not persuaded that
the Commissioner erred in his characterisation of the agreement between the parties. Indeed the appellant conceded that he had entered
into an agreement with the respondent to settle his unfair dismissal application
. The existence of an ‘accord and satisfaction’ between the parties in respect of the appellant’s claim was an appropriate
basis for dismissing that claim. As Besanko J observed in
Australian Postal Corporation v Gorman:
“...a valid and effective accord and satisfaction extinguishes the pre existing cause of action and continued pursuant of an
application based on such a cause of action is clearly capable of being considered to be frivolous or vexatious or without reasonable
prospect of success”
There were no significant errors of fact in the decision subject to appeal and the Appellant has failed to persuade us that the decision
was tainted by legal error or that the discretion miscarried.
We are not persuaded that it is in the public interest that permission to appeal should be allowed. Accordingly, we refuse the application
for permission to appeal.
