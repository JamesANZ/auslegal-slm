Pay-roll Tax Charitable Exemption - Meaning of Exclusively (PT-125) [2006] VICSROPT 5 (1 May 2006)
Pay-roll Tax Charitable Exemption
� Meaning of Exclusively
Revenue Rulings
Section 10(1)(bb)
Pay-roll Tax Act
provides an exemption from Pay-roll Tax to charitable
bodies (other than schools, educational institutions
or instrumentalities of the State). This exemption is
restricted to wages paid to persons engaged exclusively
in the charitable work of the body.
Uncertainty may arise where:
� an organisation is established for both charitable and
non-charitable purposes; or
� an organisation that is charitable in the legal and
technical sense has undertaken commercial activities
to raise funds to finance their primary charitable
The purpose of this Revenue Ruling is to explain the
interpretation adopted by the Commissioner of State
Revenue (the Commissioner) of the term `exclusively'
as referred to in
section 10(1)(bb)
of the Act. In
doing so, this Revenue Ruling clarifies the Pay-roll Tax
treatment of wages paid to employees engaged in
commercial activities and those who are engaged in
both the charitable and non-charitable functions of the
organisation.
The term `charitable body' is not defined in the
Act. Therefore the question of whether or not an
organisation is a charitable body is determined in
accordance with common law principles.
According to common law principles, a body is
charitable in the technical and legal sense if:
i. it is established for the relief of poverty, the
advancement of education, the advancement
of religion or other purposes beneficial to the
community; and
ii. its objects are directed towards public benefit.
The Commissioner takes the view that an organisation
established for both charitable and non-charitable
purposes is not regarded as a charitable body unless
the non-charitable purposes are merely incidental and
ancillary to its main charitable purpose. For instance,
some organisations that are charitable bodies in the
technical and legal sense may undertake business
activities in order to raise funds to finance their primary
charitable purpose.
The employees of such a charitable body may belong
to one of the following categories:
Persons engaged directly in the
charitable work
Category II
Persons engaged in administrative/
management roles
Category III
Persons engaged wholly in the
business activities undertaken to
fund its charitable work
Wages paid to persons in Category I, such as carers
and counsellors, clearly satisfy the requirements of the
section and are exempt from Pay-roll Tax.
On a strict interpretation of
section 10(1)(bb)
Act, persons in Category II are not considered as
being engaged exclusively in the charitable work of the
organisation. Therefore, wages paid to these personnel
are technically excluded from the exemption.
However, where such persons are engaged
predominantly in work associated with the body's
charitable activities, the Commissioner will regard
those persons as being engaged exclusively in
charitable work. A Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
would typically fall within this category. Others such as
administrative staff or a bookkeeper who is responsible
for the accounts of both the charitable body and
business activities may also fall within this category.
Accordingly, the Commissioner will regard wages paid
to those persons as exempt from Pay-roll Tax.
Where a person's role and duties encompass both
charitable and business activities, but he/she is
engaged predominantly in the body's charitable
activities, the wages paid to that person are always
subject to Pay-roll Tax.
Wages paid to persons in Category III are subject
to Pay-roll Tax even if the business activities of the
charitable body are incidental and ancillary to its main
charitable purpose. This is because these persons are
not engaged either exclusively or predominantly in
charitable activities.
Revenue Ruling PT.125
Non-charitable purpose that is merely incidental and
ancillary to the main charitable purpose
The Helpers is a fictitious charitable body
whose primary purpose is to provide short-term
accommodation and meals to the needy. In order
to generate additional funds, the organisation runs
a plant nursery and employs staff to work in that
The Helpers employs a total of ninety persons engaged
in the following capacities:
� sixty persons engaged directly in the provision of
charitable services to the needy;
� two managers to oversee the charitable services;
� eight persons provide administration and support
services (five of these provide administrative/support
services to the charitable activities only, two provide
administrative/support services to both the charitable
and the plant nursery activities and one provides
administrative/support services to the plant nursery
business only);
� a CEO and a Financial Controller; and
� eighteen persons engaged in the operation of plant
nursery business (the profits of which are used to
funds The Helpers charitable activities);
Wages paid to the following persons are clearly exempt
from Pay-roll Tax:
� the sixty persons engaged directly in the provision of
the charitable services;
� the two managers engaged to oversee the charitable
services; and
� the five administrative/support staff members
providing services to the charitable activities only.
Wages paid to the following persons are clearly not
exempt from Pay-roll Tax:
� the eighteen employees engaged in the plant
nursery business;
� the administrative/support staff providing services to
the plant nursery business only.
Strictly speaking, the wages paid to the CEO, the
Financial Controller and the two administrative/support
staff that service both the charitable activities and
plant nursery business are not wages paid to persons
engaged exclusively in the charitable work of the
body, because their roles and responsibilities also
encompass the non-charitable plant nursery business.
However, the Commissioner will regard these wages as
exempt from Pay-roll Tax as long as their duties and
responsibilities are directed predominantly towards the
charitable work of the organisation.
Unless a charitable body, such as The Helpers, pays
wages to employees engaged in non-charitable
activities in excess of the threshold, no Pay-roll Tax is
payable. If any charitable body is unsure of its liability
in this regard, it should seek a private ruling from this
