Recommendation
- That all South Australian
maternity hospitals consider the implementation of a policy, to be enforced by
the Head of the Department,
that ensures the most senior registrar onsite is
appropriately credentialled to undertake complex deliveries independently unless
there is a consultant onsite and available.
Response from SA Health
recommendation has been considered in consultation with all relevant Local
Health Networks (LHNs) and is accepted in principle.
SA Health public
hospitals providing maternity and neonatal services have a range service level
delineation, particularly between
regional and metropolitan health service
facilities. The workforce is aligned with the degree of complexity and level of
provided within each unit. The Maternity & Neonatal Services
Clinical Capability Framework and SA Health Standards for Maternity
and Neonatal
Services in South Australia 2020 outline the service and workforce requirements
for South Australian public hospitals,
defining the scope of safe clinical
Assessment for
high-risk pregnancy and births occurs during gestation to plan appropriate care.
However, while most births will be
straightforward, any delivery can develop
into a complex one. All SA Health public
hospitals have escalation pathways in place for instances when the complexity of
care increases. This involves transfer of patients
to a more appropriate
facility or receiving additional support if transfer isn’t possible.
credentialling process for medical staff is undertaken in accordance with SA
Health policy and the Accreditation Standards and
Guidelines for Hospitals in
the Fellowship of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians
and Gynaecologists (FRANZCOG)
Training Program (v1.9 Nov 2022). This includes
approval of the scope of clinical practice that determines the level of
supervision
required for registrars and other doctors in training.
Metropolitan
health services providing maternity and neonatal services have local
credentialling, rostering, and competency assessment
procedures in place,
implemented by Heads of Department, to inform and guide decision making for
after-hours medical rostering, this
includes when the Consultant on call is
required to be onsite. These procedures align to the Accreditation Standards and
for Hospitals in the FRANZCOG Training Program Criteria 3.2.3:
Appropriate After-Hours Supervision and Teaching, which outlines the
requirements:
FRANZCOG trainees have immediate access to the duty Consultant for advice
and, where appropriate, their physical presence, to assist
with 3 decision
making, for the supervision and assistance of procedures, and for teaching and
training opportunities.
Each FRANZCOG trainee with less than two years’ postgraduate experience
in obstetrics and gynaecology who is rostered on night
duty has adequate
supervision by an onsite (or immediately available – within five minutes)
Consultant or more experienced
Registrar, even when the FRANZCOG trainee has
been credentialed by the hospital to perform specific procedures without direct
supervision.
Metropolitan
health services are collaborating to standardise these procedures across their
SA Health have
considered the need to implement a policy as outlined by the Coroner. However,
it has been determined that this is
not required as adherence to the
Accreditation Standards and Guidelines for Hospitals in the FRANZCOG Training
Program and competency-based
arrangements for rostering within the LHNs will
deliver the aim of the recommendation to ensure safe service delivery across SA
maternity hospitals.
