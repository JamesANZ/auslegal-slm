[2025] FWC 3314
FAIR WORK COMMISSION
Fair Work Act 2009
- Application for an order to stop bullying
(AB2025/752)
COMMISSIONER MCKINNON
SYDNEY, 13 NOVEMBER 2025
Application for an order to stop bullying at work – whether
application has reasonable prospects of success
September 2025, Mrs Natalie Colbert applied for an order to stop bullying at
work under s.789FC of the
Fair Work Act 2009
(the Act). The application
was made in relation to ASG Melbourne Pty Ltd trading as Doncaster BMW
(Doncaster BMW) and a person with
whom Mrs Colbert interacted while at work in
the business of Doncaster BMW.
September 2025, Mrs Colbert resigned from her employment with Doncaster BMW.
Neither this fact, nor its consequence that Mrs
Colbert is no longer at work in
the business of Doncaster BMW, is in dispute. This means that Mrs Colbert is no
longer interacting
with the individual named in the application in any work
context. The Commission could not make any orders in the matter. Accordingly,
Mrs Colbert’s application for orders to stop bullying at work has no
reasonable prospects of
application (AB2025/752) is dismissed under section 587(1)(c) of the Act.
