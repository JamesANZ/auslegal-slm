Bernabe, Benita v Tony Myers [2000] NTADComm 2 (23 October 2000)
ANTI-DISCRIMINATION COMMISSION
COMPLAINANT: Bernita Bernabe
RESPONDENT: Tony Myers
TRIBUNAL: Mr Tom Stodulka
Hearing Commissioner
ISSUE: s. 73 - Application to join party
DATE OF APPLICATION: 4 July 2000
DATE OF DECISION: 23 October
Bernita Bernabe brought a complaint of victimisation against Mr Tony Myers
pursuant to section 23 of the
Anti-Discrimination Act 1992
(the Act) on 7
October 1999. The complaint was accepted on 16 November 1999, and a
decision in favour of the Complainant made on 20 April 2000.
The complaint related to incidents at Mrs Bernabe's place of employment,
the Aboriginal and Islander Medical Support Service (AIMSS).
Mr Myers was Mrs
Bernabe's supervisor. Since the complaint was made, AIMMS has ceased to carry
out the functions it had previously.
Those functions are now being undertaken by
Territory Health Services (THS).
Conciliation in relation to Mrs
Bernabe's complaint was, for many months, impossible due to the illness of Mr
Myers. Mrs Bernabe,
in a letter dated 4 July, requested that the complaint
proceed to Hearing. She also requested that AIMSS be joined as a respondent
that Hearing.
I have, today, published
reasons for decision in an application to join a respondent at Hearing pursuant
to section 73 of the Act
Smith v Ciarla
. In response to that
application, I determined that I do not have the power under the Act to join a
party at the Hearing stage of
the processes established by the Act.
Bernabe's application is, in all material respects, the same as the application
Smith v Ciarla
which I have refused. Accordingly, for the same reasons
I refuse the application to join AIMSS as a respondent to the present
proceedings.
For the information of the parties I attach a copy of my
reasons for decision in
The application to join AIMSS is
dismissed. The matter has already been listed for a further Directions Hearing
on Friday 10 November
at 10.00 am at which time I will issue directions for the
conduct of the hearing between the Complainant and the Respondent.
