[Extract from Queensland Government Industrial
dated 3 July, 2009, Vol. 191, No. 8, pages 253-255]
INDUSTRIAL COURT OF QUEENSLAND

and Safety Act 1995
- s. 164(3) - appeal against decision of industrial
Thomas Borthwick & Sons (Australia) Pty Ltd AND Gavin
Scott Wesche (C/2009/1)
PRESIDENT HALL
25 June 2009
This Appeal concerns injuries suffered by Tatiane Da Costa Rodrigues Sousa.
The injuries were sustained by her on 24 October 2006
in the course of her
employment at a meatworks in Mackay operated by Thomas Borthwick & Sons
(Australia) Pty Ltd (hereafter Borthwick),
a corporation under the
By 24 October 2006, Ms Sousa had been employed by Borthwick for
room inclined conveyor belt which carried meat to the packing area. She had not
previously performed work on or about
that conveyor belt. The Industrial
Magistrate's description of the incident in which she sustained injury is
uncontroversial and
I reproduce the description:
"She was soaping the conveyor belt and was using a hose but the water
pressure was low. She saw a piece of meat at the edge of the
conveyor belt and
just tried to remove it. The teeth of the conveyor belt caught the gloves that
she was wearing and pulled her
arm in. With her arm caught underneath the steel
bars the conveyor belt was turned off but, unfortunately someone thinking that
they were turning it off turned it on again. As a result she received the
injuries as mentioned in the particulars.".
Before commencing to perform work in her employment, Ms Sousa had been
exposed to an induction course which, amongst other things,
dealt with safety at
work. She had passed an assessment. The Industrial Magistrate found
(favourably to Borthwick) that Ms Sousa
was perfectly well aware that employees
were not permitted to reach into moving plant, e.g. to remove a piece of meat.
She understood
that employees were required to turn off the power supply to the
relevant plant and to lock and tag the switch before reaching into
plant. There
is an express finding that Ms Sousa decided to remove the piece of meat while
the belt was moving because, the meat
being at the edge of the belt, she formed
the opinion that it was safe to do so. However, adversely to Borthwick, the
Magistrate also found that Ms Sousa had received no instruction
specific to the conveyor belt upon which she was working on 24 October
not been shown and did not know the location of the switch to turn off the
power; and had not been provided with a lock
and tag to secure the switch
against being turned on again after the conveyor belt had been
The incident of 24 October 2006, led to an investigation by the
Division of Workplace Health and Safety. On 27 April 2007, a complaint
before a Justice of the Peace that Borthwick failed to discharge an obligation
imposed upon the company by the
Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995
the obligation at s. 28(1) of the Act. The following
particulars were given:
"Particulars
Other person: Tatiane Da Costa Rodrigues SOUSA.
undertaking: Beef processing and exporting.
Workplace: Bakers
Creek, Mackay.
Risk: The risk is the risk of injuries to workers including the risk of
fracture injuries to the radius and ulna bones of the
right forearm of Tatiane
Da Costa Rodrigues SOUSA.
Hazard: The sources of the risk emanates from:
plant namely the boning room North Primal incline conveyor belt; and
b. the system of work for cleaning of moving plant, namely the boning
room North Primal incline conveyor belt.".
A circumstance of aggravation
was alleged
the injury by way of grievous bodily harm sustained by
Borthwick defended the charge. By a decision of 15 December
2008, the Industrial Magistrate found the company to be guilty of the
offence. After a sentencing hearing on 24 February 2009, a conviction was
recorded and a fine of $64,000 was imposed. Borthwick
was also ordered to pay
provisional costs of $1,825; witness expenses in the sum of $160; interpreter
costs of $1,723.13; costs of
court of $66.40; and investigation costs of
$1,592.45. This is an appeal against the finding of guilt and, in the
alternative, against
the quantum of the fine.
The finding that Ms Sousa
had not been informed of the location of the switch to turn off the conveyor
belt was critical. Control
measures which are not implemented are of no
consequence, compare
Abigroup Contractors Pty Ltd v Clive John Newman
(2008) 188 QGIG 45
at 49. The finding was an insuperable obstacle to a
submission that the Defendant had "adopted
and followed
" a stated or
other way to prevent the contravention or manage the risk. The finding was also
a very substantial difficulty to overcome
on a submission that the offence "was
due to causes over which [the Defendant] had no control".
certainly evidence to support the finding that Ms Sousa had not been made aware
of the location of the switch. It fell
from Ms Sousa in the course of
cross-examination. However, there was evidence to the contrary. In the course
of the investigation
Ms Sousa had been interviewed by an inspector (Ms Read)
from the Division of Workplace Health and Safety. Whilst the interview was
reduced to writing, it was not tendered. However, Ms Read gave evidence that Ms
Sousa had told her where the isolation button was
located, saying:
"the isolating button for the belt I was working on is on the far end of the
belt around the highest point of the belt about three
meters or so away from
where I was working at the time of the incident.".
In fact, the location nominated was the correct location. Ms Read also
gave evidence that Ms Sousa said:
"I saw a little bit of fat in the corner of the belt; it was on the spur of
the moment - sorry, it was a on the spur of the moment
decision and I knew in
the back of my mind that I wasn't supposed to put my hand into the conveyor
unless it was stopped, but I did
anyway. Every other time I would usually stop
the machine to take the scraps of fat out, but most times it was already stopped
tagged out for me, if I had to go and help in that area or do the area
I hasten to add that there were issues about the interview. English was
not Ms Sousa's native language. A fellow Portuguese speaker
had acted as an
interpreter. Ms Sousa challenged the accuracy of the record of interview.
However, to recognise that there was
such an issue is to underscore that there
were conflicting sets of evidence. It seems to me that consistently with the
observations
of Meagher JA in
Beale v Government Insurance Office of New
South Wales
(1997) 48 NSWLR 430
at 443 to 444 and of the Court of Appeal in
Drew v Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd
(2009) QCA 66
to [66], the
point had been reached at which the Industrial Magistrate articulate
accepting one body of evidence rather than the other.
It follows that
the Industrial Magistrate erred in law and that His Honour's decision must be
set aside. I have considered rehearing
the matter on the record and
substituting another decision. The problem is that it is all about credibility
in a criminal matter.
Accepting that the advantages of hearing and seeing a
witness give evidence may be over-estimated, it seems to me that in a criminal
matter a defendant is entitled to insist (as the Appellant has) that the
opportunity be taken. One cannot accept that the conviction
may be sustained on
an alternative basis. If Ms Sousa's evidence about the location of the switch
is rejected, Ms Sousa's evidence
provide a lock and tag, might well be reconsidered.
I allow the Appeal.
I remit the matter to the Industrial Magistrate at Mackay to be heard and
determined according to law.
