LEGISLATION CITED:
Anti-Discrimination Act 1991
(Queensland),
sections 7(n)
REPRESENTATION:
All parties were self-represented.
16 November 2005 Mark Kelly (the Complainant) filed a complaint with the
Commissioner appointed under the
Anti Discrimination Act 1991 (Qld)
(“the Act”) alleging a contravention of the provisions of the
Act by Gary Moore namely that:
Complainant was the victim of discrimination based upon the prescribed attribute
of sexuality (s.7(n) of the Act) in a prescribed
area of activity-work (Chap 1
Pt 4 Div 2 Subdivision 1 s.15 of the Act);
vilification on the grounds of sexuality (Chap 4 Pt 4 s.124A);
(c) un-lawful
requests for information (Chap 4 Pt 3 s.124).
details in the complaint of the contraventions are dated 27 August 2005 but
appear to relate to the entire period in which the
Complainant was employed by
the Second Respondent G J and A M Moore Pty Ltd trading as Tall Timbers Motel
and Caravan Park (of which
Gary Moore is a director) an establishment on the
Kennedy Highway at Ravenshoe in far north Queensland.
gravamen of the complaint as it first appeared was that Mr Moore had frequently
inquired of Mr Kelly as to his sexual habits,
the identify of his sexual
partners, with whom he took up these habits, and his (Mr Moore’s) views of
people with such habits.
It was specifically alleged that Mr Moore had
“enjoyed telling other people about (the Complainant) and my sexuality,
and joking to my detriment”. At the hearing before me that last
allegation which appears to be the “public vilification”
conceded to be merely a suspicion that that was occurring rather than any
evidence of actual jokes overheard directed at the
Complainant.
was said that had caused the Complainant to leave his employment; caused him to
become ill and have “psychological pain”.
a hearing of the matter before another member of this Tribunal the Complainant
tendered two statements made by him (exhibit 1 and
2) and gave evidence. That
material was again relied upon in the hearing before me.
a statement dated 25 July 2006 Mark Kelly alleged that Gary Moore
(a) called him
a shirt lifter – a term he found derogating and insulting;
(b) during the
period of his employment by Mr Moore (between 28 July 2005 and November 2005)
been the subject of abuse to the point
he could not continue – though the
content of the abuse was not there set out; and
(c) that after
his resignation he was unemployed for three months (although no details were
forthcoming about his remuneration either
before, during or after the
second statement similarly dated is to identical effect.
his evidence
chief and cross-examination the Complainant added little of substance to the
above statement. He said variously that:
(a) Mr Moore
had inquired of him whilst he was cooking hamburgers in the kitchen how he could
have sex with another
(b) Mr Moore
called Mr Kelly a shirt lifter on more than one
Importantly
unlike the tenor of his written complaint and statement the Complainant
repeatedly said that on those occasions no-one
: nor did he
confront or challenge Mr Moore about these remarks until he
Moore contends that he never enquired of or degraded the Complainant on any
basis least of all on the basis of his sexuality.
He contended that the
Complainant was rarely alone at work hence his constant abuse would have been
overheard. Mr Moore to make
out that contention tendered statements from Mr
Kelly’s co-workers.
of the other witnesses whose statements were tendered on behalf of the
respondent– Leigh Dawson, Paul Nader, Katreena Nader,
Sharon Prior and
Kaye Nicol denied ever overhearing any such abuse (albeit only Sharon Prior and
Paul Nader were produced for cross-examination).
But that is merely to confirm
the Respondent’s version of events, contrary to the complaint, that the
complainant was not
publicly denigrated.
find on the balance of probability, the following occurred. In late July/early
August 2005 the Complainant commenced employment
at the Second
Respondent’s business (The Caravan Park). He did so at the behest of
either Katreena or Paul Nader who were
employed to run the kitchen at the
Caravan Park
a good worker but he had an abrasive personality and a dislike for direction
from his co-workers or employer.
after the Complainant commenced employment a fellow employee “Liz”
told Mr Moore she thought the Complainant was
Complainant admitted he was homosexual. That became common knowledge in the
workplace. This prompted a dialogue between the
Complainant and other employees
as to his sexuality.
are, in a manner not uncommon to disputes of this nature, two versions of this
dialogue – one that the Complainant freely
discussed his sexual
preferences and practices to the point that he offended his fellow employees and
conversely that the banter
in the work place bordered on the ridicule of the
complainant to such an extent that shortly after he commenced employment he was
apt to warn “Everybody in this place wants to be careful because if they
don’t treat me right I’ll be going to
the Anti Discrimination
Tribunal”. Although the Complainant denied making the reference to this
Tribunal I generally prefer
the evidence of Mr Moore’s witnesses as to
that save that I do not accept the banter was friendly it was more likely to
been and was unwelcome.
Complainant was himself the subject of fairly continuous criticism about his
work practices. Ms Prior in her statements speaks
of her extreme frustration
regularly requested Mr
Moore speak with Mr Kelly about these matters. Although
she says she was always present when this occurred. I do not accept that
seems to me that the more the criticism the more the Complainant wrongly
attributed it to his sexuality which (despite Mr Moore’s
minimize it) I think likely was the subject of regular discussion in the work
place by at least September 2005.
in s.124A, nor does it qualify as an unlawful
request for information under
s.124. It is not suggested by the complainant to amount to sexual harassment.
The Anti-Discrimination
Commission treated the complaint as one alleging sexual
harassment as well as sexuality discrimination, but nothing turns on that
I would not make any different order if I viewed the conduct as amounting to
sexual harassment rather than sexuality discrimination.
the generality of much of the evidence and the lack of much particular reliable
evidence makes it difficult, in my view the
conduct I have described above does
amount to discrimination based on sexuality. Mr Kelly was treated differently
to others because
he was homosexual. It was put to him that he was gay –
thereafter the subject of his sexuality was discussed at least twice
Moore referred to Mr Kelly as a shirt lifter in a manner Mr Kelly found
offensive. It is irrelevant that Mr Kelly in other
circumstances may have used
the term self-referentially in a non offensive manner – that distinction
is common enough. It
was inappropriate for Mr Moore as a director of Mr
Kelly’s employer to have referred or allowed others to refer to Mr
sexuality in an offensive manner in the workplace. At least on
two occasions he participated in that by calling Mr Kelly a shirt
lifter. That
is the breach of the Act I find.
making these two statements the Second Respondent employer contravened the Act.
It directly discriminated against the Complainant
contrary to s.9 in the area of
work on the basis of a prescribed attribute. The First Respondent is liable
under s.114 of the Act.
The Second Respondent is also liable under s.132 and
133 of the Act for the acts of the First Respondent.
Respondent offered a limited apology. I think that was a genuine attempt to
make amends. I do not think that Mr Moore really
understands that to Mr Kelly
passing remarks not said with the intention of offending can in fact profoundly
offend. I think inevitably
Mr Kelly would not have maintained his casual
employment with the Second Respondent – his incapacity for complying with
system in place there was such that inevitably he would have been soon
replaced. There is no evidence of physical or mental ill
health. The harm done
was exacerbated by discussions of matters in which Mr Kelly continued to
participate albeit after he had warned
his fellow employees of his discontent.
This type of workplace misconduct although regrettably common, falls within the
lower scale
of such complaints. It is not possible given the lack of any weight
of particular evidence to be precise amount the extent of Mr
Kelly’s hurt
other than in respect of the two occasions upon which I find he was referred to
as a shirt lifter.
award $2,000.00 in compensation (inclusive of interest). I make no allowance
for economic loss or damages for psychological illness.
The parties were not
legally represented. I make no order as to costs.
