Medical Board of the Australian Capital Territory
Professional Standards Panel Outcomes
The inquiry subject matter consisted of allegations that Dr PF:
to take an adequate history and conduct an appropriate examination;
the patient to take Buscopan without taking an adequate history or
considering alternative diagnoses.
Dr PF stated that he had no recollection of the consultation with
the patient. He acknowledged that his notes were very brief and
stated that his notes are always somewhat briefer than those of his
colleagues, but not usually this brief. He acknowledged that
speed is slow. He could not state whether or not he examined the patient
or took a full history. He said that it would
be his usual
practice to examine a patient who complained of abdominal pain but
admitted there were no notes to confirm that he
did so on this
occasion. He expressed his regret at missing the diagnosis of
appendicitis.
Dr PF was shown a copy of the Standards Statement issued by the
ACT Medical Board regarding Maintenance of Medical Records. He
ever seeing this document. He had no comment regarding the
difficulty of the patient in obtaining a further appointment that
He was questioned further on how he would deal with a
receptionist who took it upon herself to advise the patient and it
clear that there might be some difficulty in a corporate practice
for the doctor himself dealing with such matters.
The panel found that Dr PF failed to take an adequate history and
conduct an appropriate examination and failed to consider alternative
diagnoses when advising treatment with Buscopan.
The panel�s reasons for decision were:
Complete inadequacy of the medical record.
Admission by Dr PF that he had no memory of the consultation.
Failure by Dr PF to have
in place at the time of the incident adequate procedures for easy access
for a further urgent consultation
with his patient.
The panel ordered that Dr PF be formally reprimanded and that the
panel be adjourned to a date and time to be fixed (within three
of this order). The panel will then reconvene at the practice
premises of Dr PF where the panel will choose and examine
selection of the medical records made by Dr PF from the date of this
hearing. Should the medical records have improved
to an adequate
standard, no further action will be considered by the panel. If
the medical records have not improved, then the
panel will reconvene for
a further hearing.
