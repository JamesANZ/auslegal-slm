Dr PE [2007] ACTMBPSP 5 (1 January 2007)
Medical Board of the Australian Capital Territory
Professional Standards Panel Outcomes
The subject matter of the Inquiry consists of allegations that Dr PE failed to:
adequately communicate with a patient of the possible risks of the
treatment she was receiving;
undertake an adequate physical examination when the patient complained
of pain following the procedure;
effectively communicate directions for adequate follow up care; and
make adequate arrangements to consult with the patient when she called
and returned to the surgery the next day.
The panel enquired of Dr PE about the absence of a consent form.
Dr PE stated that it was her usual practice to have the patient
sign the Medical Record to acknowledge that information has been given
and that consent to the treatment was given. She stated
did not know why this procedure was not followed with this
patient. She admitted that specific discussion of the remote
possibility of pneumothorax was not discussed, but she stated that there
was a discussion about the general risks and benefits
treatment. She was adamant that a Patient Information sheet
regarding the treatment would have been given to the patient
treatment was first mooted.
The panel discussed the interpretation of the MRI imaging
report. Dr PE agreed that the MRI showed some changes described in
structure of the neck and spinal cord that possibly could cause
neck pain. She did not consider referral to a Neurosurgeon was
indicated at that time. She pointed out that the pain, which the
patient was suffering, was of long standing, and that most modalities
treatment had already been tried. She pointed out that the
patient had been seen by a neurosurgeon in 2004. She believed that
Prolotherapy would offer the best chance of remediation of the pain,
and was well worth trying.
The panel discussed the matter of difficulty in obtaining an
emergency appointment on the day following the incident. Dr PE
that she was not made aware of the request for an emergency
appointment until later in the morning of the day following the
Evidence given by the patient that the receptionist had
told her that she had discussed the matter with the doctor who had
her to come to the surgery that morning� was not accepted by
Dr PE, who denied having been told of the patient�s telephone call
that time. She stated that had she been told at that time she
would have seen the patient immediately. She stated that as soon
as the patient was seen (later that afternoon) an X-Ray was immediately
ordered, and, on the discovery of a pneumothorax, admission
to hospital
was organised.
Dr PE was questioned regarding the absence of any written
description of physical findings in the Medical Record. She stated
�I�m sure that I did examine�the patient, but acknowledged that
there was nothing written to confirm her assertion. The panel
that in general there was a paucity of recorded examination
findings in the medical record.
Dr PE stated that, since this incident, the number of emergency
appointments available at her practice had been increased to two
morning and one each afternoon. She further stated that the
reception staff had received clear guidelines as to the necessity
informing the doctor immediately if a similar emergency were to arise.
The panel found that Dr PE:
Failed to adequately communicate the possible risks of the treatment proposed
Failed to undertake an
adequate physical examination when pain was complained of both
immediately following the procedure and the
following day.
Failed to effectively communicate directions for adequate follow up care.
Failed to make adequate
arrangements to speedily consult when the patient returned to the
surgery on the following morning.
The panel�s reasons for its decision were:
The absence of any written consent to
the procedure or acknowledgement in the medical record that consent had
been requested.
No evidence in the medical record of any physical examination.
No written evidence in the
medical record of any post-procedural instructions or of follow up
Failure to have in place at the
time of the incident adequate procedures for dealing with urgent
requests for a consultation. Even
though the decision may have
been actually made by a receptionist, the doctor is ultimately
responsible.
The panel therefore ordered that Dr PE be formally reprimanded
and that Dr PE work within an Accident and Emergency Department of
public hospital for five (5) sessions. It is our hope that during
these sessions Dr PE will acquire improved medical record keeping
and communication and consent skills that will stand her in good stead
for the remainder of her career.
