APPEARANCES
For the Applicant In person
For the Respondent In person
For the Interested Party Mr A Ali, solicitor
29 January 2025, Rajat Paul and Amisha Paul (
Interested Parties
their demolition contractor and agent, Farah Merho of Demolition Masters
), applied to Jason Singh (
), the relevant
building surveyor, for a building permit (
Original Permit Application
demolish the entire building situated at 100 Argyle Way, Wantirna South
Subject Land
considering the Original Permit Application, the Respondent determined that
protection work was required to protect the neighbouring
property at 98 Argyle
Way, Wantirna South (
the Adjoining Property
), which is owned by Wei Huang
Accordingly,
on 7 February 2025, the Respondent issued to the Interested Parties a Form 6
Determination that Protection Work is Required
Initial Determination
pursuant to reg 111(4) of the
Building Regulations 2018
Regulations
) to protect the Adjoining Property.
Determination
5 of the Initial Determination specifically noted that the proposed building
work that gave rise to the need for protection
work to protect the Adjoining
Property was the
“[d]emolition of masonry garage wall
180mm off the title boundary on the northern side
of the Subject Land.
other building work was determined to give rise to a need for protection works
to protect the Adjoining Property, despite the rest
of the building being
demolished.
a result of the Initial Determination,
Building Act 1993
) was triggered, which required the Interested Parties to
issue a Form 7 protection work notice to the Applicant.
7 February 2025, the Interested Parties, via its Agent, issued to the Applicant
a Form 7 Protection Work Notice pursuant to
regulation 113
of the Regulations to
the Adjoining Owner (
Form 7 Protection Notice
), specifically stating:
a) the proposed building work was the
“[d]emolition of masonry garage
wall 180mm off the title boundary on the northern side boundary;”
b) the proposed protection work consisted of manual demolition by hand of the
Garage Wall and the installation of temporary fencing
Proposed Protection Work
to the Initial Determination, no other proposed building work was referred to in
the Form 7 Protection Notice.
16 February 2025, the Applicant issued to the Agent a Form 8 Protection Work
Response Notice pursuant to reg 114 of the Regulations
Form 8 Protection
a) disagreeing with the Proposed Protection Work; and
b) requesting further information.
Subsequently,
there were a series of correspondence and discussions between the Applicant and
the Interested Parties; the Applicant
and the Respondent; as well as between the
Interested Parties and the Respondent regarding the Proposed Protection
Relevantly,
on 13 March 2025, the Respondent decided and informed the Applicant that the
Interested Parties had changed their building
work and that the demolition of
the Garage Wall, which was the only works the subject of the Protection Work
Determination, was no
longer required (
Purported Determination
), that is,
the Garage Wall was being retained by the Interested Parties (
Building Works
the Purported Determination, it specifically stated:
a) “[d]ue to this design change, protection works are no longer deemed
b) the demolition of other structures not part of the Protection Works
Determination would not adversely affect the Adjoining Property.
then followed was a series of further correspondence, which can be characterised
as disputation between the parties and which
included various civil engineering
reports being commissioned and provided by:
a) the Interested Parties, which in summary supported the fact that as the
Garage Wall was being retained, no protection work would
be required to protect
the Adjoining Property; and
b) the Applicant, which in summary:
why the remaining building works would not require protection of the Adjoining
risks to the Adjoining Property remained with the other building works; and
that the propping of the Garage Wall itself was protection works.
18 March 2025, the Respondent issued an amended building permit (
Building Permit
) granting a permit for the
demolition of a dwelling,
outbuildings and propping works to the garage wall. (
Amended Building
protection work was required by the RBS for the Amended Building Works nor was a
further From 6 issued by the RBS for the Amended
Building Works.
22 March 2025, the Applicant appealed under
Building Act
Building Appeals Board (
), seeking a determination of the BAB in place
of the Applicant’s assertion that the Respondent had failed or refused to
a determination or declaration in response to the Applicant’s
Protection Response.
6 May 2025, the BAB issued directions and orders that an e-hearing be held to
hear a preliminary question of
“whether the Respondent is
given that the scope of the building work has been amended and the
Respondent has determined to withdraw the ‘Form 6 –
Determination
that protection work is required’
Preliminary Question
hearing of the Preliminary Question was held on 22 May
have considered the parties’ oral and written submissions and the
materials filed with the BAB.
have also had regard to:
a) the Act and the Regulations; and
b) the second reading speech by the then Minister for Planning, Mr Maclellan
when the Act was read a second time on 11 November 1993
Reading Speech
as they all are relevant in regard to protection work determined
under the Act.
stated objectives of the Act are set out in
, which include:
a) to protect the safety and health of people who use buildings;
e) to facilitate the cost effective construction and maintenance of buildings;
g) to aid the achievement of an efficient and competitive building industry.
Reading Speech also reinforced the efficiency objectives of the Act and
specifically dealt with protection work, as it specifically
a) the non-legalistic approach of the former building referees boards will be,
and must be continued [by the newly formed
b) “an enhanced version of the existing building referees boards will
replace the current more expensive arbitrator system
of resolving disputes ...
where protection works are deemed necessary for properties adjoining proposed
building works.
the umbrella of these stated objectives, the protection work provisions of the
Act are set out in:
– Protection of Adjoining Property of the Act; and
b) Part 7 – Protection of Adjoining Property and the Public of the
Regulations.
the Applicant rightly submits, reg 111 of the Regulations deals with the
Respondent’s initial protection work obligations
a) reg 111(2) which requires the Respondent to determine whether protection work
is require as a result of proposed building work
when deciding an application
for a building permit for that work;
b) reg 111(3) which allows the Respondent to make a determination at any time;
c) make a determination in the prescribed form of Form 6.
112 of the Regulations then sets out the various factors and criteria that the
Respondent must have regard to when determining
whether protection work is
Respondent in issuing the Initial Determination correctly discharged his duties
under regs 111 and 112 when he determined protection
work was required due to
the demolition of the Garage Wall, which was the only proposed building work it
considered required protection
work given the Garage Wall’s proximity to
the Adjoining Property.
issued the Initial Determination, it was then incumbent on the Interested
Parties and the Applicant to abide by Part 7 of the
Act which they both
respectively discharged by:
a) serving the Form 7 Protection Notice as required by section 84 of the Act;
b) give the Form 8 Protection Response as required by section 85 of the Act,
disagreeing with the Proposed Protection Work.
to the Applicant’s disagreement set out in its Form 8 Protection Response,
section 87 of the Act was triggered, requiring
the Respondent to discharge
further protection work obligations, including:
[emphasis added]
examine the proposal for
protection work and determine the appropriateness or otherwise of the
once it received the Applicant’s Form 8 Protection
Response as required by s 87(1); and
[emphasis added]
give the owner and the
adjoining owner notice in writing of a determination under this
as required by s 87(4).
although we understand the sentiment in the Applicant’s submissions that
any further decision about the Proposed Protection
Work ought to be resolved by
the Respondent issuing a determination under section 87, we do not accept the
line of reasoning.
we find that the statutory outcome is that section 87 is in fact no longer
applicable once the Interested Parties amended
their building work to exclude
the Garage Wall.
in another way, there is no longer any
“proposal for protection
as set out in section 87 as the Interested Parties had
effectively abandoned the original scope of the building work for the new,
Amended Building Work.
the Respondent determined that the Amended Building Work did not require
protection work at all, there is no avenue for the Applicant
to appeal this new
determination about a new scope of works.
Conversely,
if the Respondent was required to make a determination under section 87, it
would mean the Respondent, the Interested
Parties and the Applicant wasting
further time, cost and resources to reach a determination about something the
Interested Parties
are no longer pursuing, which is the original Building
would be contrary to the stated objectives of the Act and the Reading Speech
purpose of s 87 is to achieve finality in relation to any current protection
work dispute. Once the Interested Parties decided
to change the scope of their
building work, there was no longer any dispute.
is the BAB’s finding that where there are changes to any originally
proposed building work, what is required then is a new
review of the building
work under regulation 111, not a review or determination under the previous
application.
is then within the RBS’s independent jurisdiction to determine whether any
protection work is required for this new building
could mean protection work is no longer required as the new building work no
longer poses a risk (as is the case here as determined
by the Respondent) or
conversely, further and additional protection work is required where the amended
building work is determined
to pose a higher risk.
Accordingly,
in regard to the Preliminary Question, the BAB determines the answer is
“no”, the Respondent is not jurisdictionally
empowered to make a
determination under s 87 once the original building work the subject of the
original Form 6 was amended.
the BAB notes the Applicant may have concerns about the risk in the remaining
building work, the correct avenue for the Applicant
to raise these issues is not
via the protection work regime under ss 84 to 87 of the Act, which is dependent
on and only initiated
where a relevant building surveyor makes a determination
under reg 111 of the Regulations.
was no such determination made for the Amended Building Work.
allow the Applicant to utilise s 87 of the Act to require other protection work
to other building work not the subject of any relevant
building surveyor’s
determination creates an additional right not provided for under the protection
work regime under Part
7 of the Act.
completeness, we note that this finding does not mean there is no consequence of
the original Form 6 issued by the Respondent,
and the subsequent Form 7 by the
Interested Parties.
the original building work has changed, there remains the issue that the
Applicant has indeed been put through time and expense
to review the original
Form 6 and Form 7 in order to comply with its obligations under s 85 of the Act.
such, the BAB’s position is that s 97 of the Act does apply to the
original disputation, which would require the Interested
Parties to pay the
Applicant all costs and expenses reasonably incurred in assessing the originally
proposed protection work the
subject of the original Form 7.
