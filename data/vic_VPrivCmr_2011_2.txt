2011 VPrivCmr 2
A Local Council called for submissions relating to an amendment to the local
laws. Any person affected by the amendment was able to
make a submission
pursuant to s. 223 of the
Local Government Act 1984
Complainant submitted a letter regarding the local law to Council, which
contained the Complainant’s name and address,
as well as general comments
regarding his neighbours, who were also identifiable.
Council held a Special Council Meeting at which it considered the submissions
it received relating to the local law. The Complainant’s
considered as part of this process. At some point after the meeting, Council
published the minutes of the meeting on its
website, attaching all of the
submissions to the minutes, including the Complainant’s. This meant that
the Complainant’s
name and address were now publicly available and could
be found by using a search engine.
The Complainant complained to Council, requesting that the
Complainant’s letter be removed from the minutes. Council responded
stating that the minutes of meeting were required to be made available to the
public as a matter of course. In addition, Council
stated that s. 223
submissions were required to be made available for public inspection in
accordance with the procedures specified
in the Act. Council felt that it had
acted appropriately and therefore would not remove the Complainant’s
letter from its website.
The Complainant made a formal complaint to the Privacy Commissioner under the
Information Privacy Act 2000
(Vic), alleging that:
Council failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the Complainant received
notice that the submission would be published
on the Local Council’s
website (IPP 1.3);
the disclosure
of the Complainant’s name and address was an unauthorised disclosure by
the Local Council (IPP 2.1); and
Council failed to take reasonable steps to protect the Complainant’s
personal information from unauthorised disclosure.
The Local Council
argued that the information collected had been used solely for the purpose for
which it was collected under s. 223
Local Government Act 1984
(Vic), and that a reasonable person would expect the information to appear in
the minutes of meetings, which had been published on
the Local Council’s
website for a number of years.
The Privacy Commissioner considered the main issue of the complaint was the
notice given to the Complainant when the submission was
made. Information
collects personal information about
an individual, the organisation must take
reasonable steps to ensure that the individual knows for what purpose the
information is
collected and in what way the organisation may disclose that
information.
The Local Council raised the fact that it provided notice which included a
specific statement that submissions would be considered
at a Special Council
Meeting. However, the notice did not state that submissions would be published
on its website. The Commissioner
considered that it was likely that a person
making a submission would not know that their entire submission would become
the minutes of a meeting, which would then be subsequently published on
On that basis, the Privacy Commissioner considered that the Local Council
failed to adequately inform the Complainant that the Complainant’s
submission would be placed on the Local Council’s website. The Privacy
Commissioner therefore referred the matter to conciliation.
The complaint was resolved at conciliation. The Local Council agreed to
remove the Complainant’s letter from its website and
offered the
Complainant a statement of regret. It also committed to additional privacy
training for its staff, agreed to amend its
notice on its website noting that submissions made may be published on the Local
