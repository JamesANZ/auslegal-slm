Committee view
Appropriation Bills
These three bills
appropriate money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for services.
House of Representatives, 30 July 2025
Multiple rights
Appropriation of money
1.32 These bills seek to appropriate money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund
for a range of services. The portfolios, budget outcomes,
and entities for which
these appropriations would be made, are set out in the schedules to each
Preliminary international human rights legal
Multiple rights
1.33 Proposed government expenditure to give effect to particular policies
may engage and limit, or promote, a range of human rights,
including civil and
political rights and economic, social and cultural rights (such as the rights to
housing, health, education and
The rights of people

policies have a particular impact on vulnerable
Indeed, these bills seek
to appropriate expenditure for entities that are directly relevant to these
vulnerable groups, such as the
Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commission,
and National Commissioner for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children and
Young People.
1.34 Australia has obligations to respect, protect and fulfil human rights,
including specific obligations to progressively realise
economic, social and
cultural rights using the maximum of resources available; and a corresponding
duty to refrain from taking retrogressive
measures (or backwards steps) in
relation to the realisation of these
1.35 Economic, social and cultural rights may be particularly affected by
appropriation bills, because any increase in funding would
likely promote such
rights. Any reduction in funding for measures which realise such rights, such as
specific health and education
services, may be considered to be retrogressive
with respect to the attainment of such rights. Retrogressive measures must be
for the purposes of international human rights law.
1.36 The statements of compatibility accompanying these bills do not identify
that any rights are engaged by the bills. They state
that the High Court has
emphasised that because appropriation Acts do not ordinarily confer authority to
engage in executive action,
they do not ordinarily confer legal authority to
spend and, as such, do not engage human
However, because
appropriations are the means by which the appropriation of money from the
Consolidated Revenue Fund is authorised,
they are a significant step in the
process of funding public services. The fact that the High Court has stated that
appropriation
Acts do not create rights or duties as a matter of Australian law
does not address the fact that appropriations may nevertheless
engage human
rights for the purposes of international human rights law. Since 2013, the
committee has consistently stated the appropriation
of funds for government
services facilitates the taking of actions which may affect the progressive
realisation of, or failure to
fulfil, Australia's obligations under
international human rights
1.37 The United Nations (UN) Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights
has noted the following with respect to human rights
and budgets:
States are required to make use of the maximum of their available resources
for the progressive realization of economic, social and
cultural rights
(International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, art. 2 (1)).
Budgets (federal, national, provincial
or local) are essential instruments of
policymaking, and often involve various departments in the central Government as
the legislative bodies, regional governments and autonomous
institutions. Through public budgeting, the State authorities establish
priorities and express their commitment to concrete actions which may improve
– or limit – the enjoyment of some social
guarantees.
1.38 There is also extensive international guidance about reporting on the
human rights compatibility of public budget
For example, the UN
Committee on the Rights of the Child has advised that countries must show how
the public budget-related measures
they have chosen to take result in
improvements in children's
and has provided
detailed guidance regarding the implementation of the rights of the child, which
'requires close attention to all
four stages of the public budget process:
planning, enacting, executing and
follow-up'.
It has also advised
that countries should 'prepare their budget-related statements and proposals in
such a way as to enable effective
comparisons and monitoring of budgets relating
to children'.
1.39 Similarly, the UN Development Fund for Women has published guidance on
monitoring government budgets for compliance with the
Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). This
identifies a government budget as a key
government activity by which to measure
the extent to which countries are implementing CEDAW, because 'it also regulates
government activities - e.g. public programmes in relation to
healthcare, employment, education, elimination of violence against
women - will
1.40 In this regard, it is noted that since 1985, Australia has published a
'Women's Budget Statement', a public document outlining
the impact of the annual
budget on gender equality. The most recent statement, published on 25 March
2025, specifies the budget measures
intended to support women, particularly in
relation to the priorities identified in
Working for Women: A Strategy for
Gender Equality
Working for Women
). These priorities are:
gender-based violence, unpaid and paid care, economic equality and security,
health, and leadership, representation
decision-making.
Women’s Budget Statement notes that since the reintroduction of gender
responsive budgeting in 2022, gender analysis and
policy alignment with the
priorities of
Working for Women
has become a core element of Government
decision-making.
The statement
explicitly links the provision of money through budget measures with improved
outcomes for women. For example:
The Government is investing $842.6 million over six years from 2025–26
to deliver the Northern Territory Remote Aboriginal Investment,
in partnership
with the Northern Territory Government and the Aboriginal Peak Organisations
Northern Territory. This funding includes
investment for critical services and
infrastructure that support the safety and wellbeing of First Nations women,
children and families.
1.41 This information is also relevant in assessing whether, and to what
extent, via the corresponding appropriation bills, Australia
is promoting human
rights and realising its human rights obligations in relation to women. However,
it is noted that the Women's
Budget Statement does not include information about
whether any of the identified measures (or other measures in the budget)
a reduction in funding, and may therefore be a retrogressive measure
requiring justification.
statements of compatibility accompanying the appropriation bills also make no
mention of the Women's Budget Statement.
1.42 Without an assessment of the human rights compatibility of appropriation
bills, it is difficult to assess whether, and to what
extent, Australia is
promoting human rights and realising its human rights obligations in respect of
specific measures proposed in
the relevant budget. For example, a retrogressive
measure in an individual bill may not, in fact, be retrogressive when understood
within the budgetary context as a whole. Further, where appropriation measures
may engage and limit human rights, an assessment of
the human rights
compatibility of the measure would provide an explanation as to whether that
limitation would be permissible under
international human rights law.
1.43 Considering that appropriation bills may engage human rights for the
purposes of international human rights law, in order to
assess such bills for
compatibility with human rights the statements of compatibility accompanying
such bills should include an assessment
of the budget measures contained in the
bill, including an assessment of:
• overall trends in the progressive realisation of economic, social and
cultural rights (including any retrogressive trends
or measures);
• the impact of budget measures (such as spending or reduction in
spending) on vulnerable groups (including women, Aboriginal
and Torres Strait
Islander people, people with disability, children and ethnic minorities);
• key individual measures which engage human rights, including a brief
assessment of their human rights
compatibility.
1.44 In relation to the overall trends in the progressive realisation of
economic, social and cultural rights, relevant considerations
may include:
• trends indicating the progressive realisation of rights using the
maximum of resources available;
• any increase in funding over time in real terms;
• trends that increase expenditure in a way which would benefit
vulnerable groups; and
• trends that result in a reduction in the allocation of funding which
may impact on the realisation of human rights and, if
so, an analysis of whether
this would be permissible under international human rights law.
1.45 In relation to the impact of spending or reduction in spending on
vulnerable groups, relevant considerations may include:
• whether there are any budget measures that may have disproportionate
impacts on particular groups (either directly or indirectly)
and accordingly,
may engage the right to equality and non-discrimination; and
• whether there are any budget measures or trends in spending over time
that seek to promote or fulfil the right to equality
and non-discrimination for
particular groups.
Committee view
1.46 The committee notes that these bills seek to appropriate money from the
Consolidated Revenue Fund to give effect to particular
policies. As has been
consistently stated since 2013,
the committee considers that the appropriation of funds facilitates the taking
of actions which may affect the progressive realisation
of, or failure to
fulfill, human rights in relation to which Australia has obligations under
international human rights law. The
committee considers that appropriations may,
therefore, engage human rights for the purposes of international human rights
increased appropriation for particular areas may promote certain rights
(such as housing, welfare, health or education), while reduced
appropriation for
particular areas may be regarded as retrogressive – a type of limitation
on rights – and require justification.
1.47 The committee acknowledges that appropriation bills may present
particular difficulties given their technical and high-level
nature, and noting
that they generally include appropriations for a wide range of programs and
activities across many portfolios.
As such, it may not be appropriate to assess
human rights compatibility for each individual measure. However, the committee
that the allocation of funds via appropriation bills is susceptible to
a human rights assessment that is directed at broader questions
compatibility, namely, the impact on progressive realisation obligations and on
vulnerable minorities or specific groups. The
Women's Budget Statement
demonstrates that it is possible to assess the impact of appropriations on the
rights of specific groups,
in this case women.
1.48 The committee also considers that a statement of compatibility with
human rights should assess the compatibility of measures
which directly impact
human rights and which are not addressed elsewhere in legislation, as the
appropriation bills may be a key
opportunity for the Parliament to consider the
compatibility of these measures with human rights.
1.49 The committee therefore seeks the advice of the Minister for Finance as
to whether the appropriation bills are compatible with
Australia's human rights
obligations, and particularly in relation to:
(a) whether and how the bills are compatible with Australia's obligations of
progressive realisation with respect to economic, social
and cultural
(b) if there are any reductions in the allocation of funding that affect
human rights obligations, whether these reductions are compatible
Australia's obligations not to unjustifiably take backward steps (a
retrogressive measure) in the realisation of economic, social
and cultural
rights; and
(c) whether and how the allocations of funding are compatible with the rights
of vulnerable groups (including women; Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander
people; people with disability; children and ethnic minorities).
