REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is a decision on a claim against the claim fund established under the
Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000
(“the Act”). The
claim is brought by Mr Peter Malunec (“the applicant”) against Matar
and Sons Pty Ltd, a
licensed motor dealer corporation (“the first
respondent”) and Mr Samir Matar, the licensed dealer principal of that
company (“the second respondent”).
The alleged false or misleading representation
bring a claim against the claim fund,
section 470
of the Act, requires that a
person must have suffered financial loss because of the happening of one of the
events listed in that
provision. The applicant relies upon the certain conduct
that he contends was a contravention by a relevant person of
section 574
“574 False representations about property
(1) A licensee or registered employee must not represent in any way to
someone else anything that is false or misleading in relation
to the letting,
exchange or sale of property.
Maximum penalty—540 penalty units.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), a licensee or registered employee
must not, in connection with the sale, or the possible sale,
of an interest in
land or in connection with the promotion in any way of the sale of an interest
in land, represent in any way to
someone else anything that is false or
misleading in relation to—
(a) the value of the land at the date of sale; or
(b) the potential income from the leasing of the land; or
(c) if the land has been previously sold, the date of the sale and the
consideration for the sale; or
(d) how the purchase of the land may affect the incidence of income
taxation on the buyer.
Maximum penalty—540 penalty units.
(3) Without limiting subsection (1) or (2), a representation is taken,
for the subsection, to be false or misleading if it would
reasonably tend to
lead to a belief in the existence of a state of affairs that does not in fact
exist, whether or not the representation
indicates that that state of affairs
does exist.
(4) Also, if a person makes a representation in relation to a matter and
the person does not have reasonable grounds for making the
representation, the
representation is taken to be misleading.
(5) The onus of establishing that the person had reasonable grounds for
making the representation is on the person.
(6) It is not a defence to a prosecution under subsection (1) or (2) for
the defendant to prove that an agreement with the person
was terminated or that
the person did not enter into an agreement because of the
representation.
(7) This section does not limit another Act or law about false or
misleading representations.
(8) In this section—
false or misleading
, in relation to a representation
includes the wilful concealment of a material fact in the
representation.
includes a person acting as a licensee, but does
not include a commercial agent.
registered employee
includes a person acting as a registered
employee, but does not include a commercial subagent.”
applicant’s allegation is that the first respondent (being a licensee) or
an employee of the first respondent engaged in
conduct that contravenes
, by making a representation to him that was false or misleading in relation
to sale of a motor vehicle.
representations are alleged to have been made: firstly on 8 September 2008, when
Michael Spencer, a motor sales person employed
by the first respondent,
represented to the applicant that there was a current safety certificate in
respect of a 1995 BMW 325i motor
vehicle; and on 26 October 2008, when the
second respondent, who was a director of the first respondent, signed certain
sales documents
and so represented that there was a current safety certificate
for the same vehicle.
examination of the documentation, which has been filed with the Tribunal and
relied upon by the parties, indicates that there was
no current safety
certificate of the vehicle as at 8 September 2008. There had been an earlier
safety certificate issued in May
2008 but it had expired well before 8 September
safety certificate was later produced dated the day of the sale, i.e. 26 October
2008. I am satisfied that that later certificate
was a false certificate,
because it states it was based upon an inspection of the vehicle at 12:15pm on
that day. That was after
the sales documentation was completed and it was at a
time when the vehicle was at a motor repair premises, where the applicant was
having its suspension adjusted. I am satisfied that the safety inspection was
not carried out at that time or afterwards and the
certificate was false.
false or misleading representation as to the existence of a current safety
certificate for the vehicle led the applicant to assume
that the vehicle was
”, to use the common expression, meaning safe to
be driven on Queensland roads.
Section 574(3)
of the Act provides that a
representation is taken to be false or misleading if it would reasonably tend to
lead to a belief in the
existence of a state of affairs that does not in fact
exist, whether or not the representation indicates the state of affairs does
exist. In the present case, this means that when the false representation as to
the existence of a current safety certificate was
made, if it reasonably led the
applicant to believe that the vehicle was roadworthy, then, if the vehicle is
not roadworthy, the
conduct is also false or misleading representation in that
provides that if a person makes a representation in relation to a matter
and does not have reasonable grounds for making that the
representation, then
the representation is taken to be misleading.
Section 574(5)
provides that the
onus of establishing that a person had reasonable grounds for making a
representation is on the person.
am satisfied that the first respondent, by one of its employees or agents Mr
Spencer and also by one of its directors or agents
the second respondent,
represented to the applicant that there was a current safety certificate in
respect of the vehicle and that
the representation was false, in that there was
no such certificate, and misleading, in that it reasonably led the applicant to
that the vehicle was roadworthy. Each of Mr Spencer and the second
respondent, when he engaged in that conduct, acted as an agent,
representative
or employee of the first respondent. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that
there was a breach of
section 574(1)
by the first respondent.
second respondent’s role was not as express as that of Mr Spencer; in that
Mr Spencer had stated that there was a current
safety certificate for the
vehicle. The second respondent merely signed some documents which indicated
that that was the case.
The representation in which the second respondent was
involved reinforced the earlier representation made by Mr Spencer. In the
circumstances I am satisfied that the second respondent, who is also a licensee,
also breached
section 574(1)
of the Act.
The claim for financial loss
applicant is entitled to claim against the claim fund for any financial loss
that he has suffered as a result of the contravention
section 574(1).
applicant’s claim is that, if he had not been mislead by the false or
misleading representation as to the safety status
of the vehicle, he would not
have purchased the vehicle. I accept his evidence; it has been proved, to the
extent that is necessary
where there has been no contradictory evidence offered
by the applicants, by the applicant’s conduct shortly after the purchase
when, having discovered some of the difficulties that the vehicle faced in
obtaining a roadworthy certificate or a safety certificate,
he contacted the
first respondent seeking to reverse the transaction. The first respondent
refused to accept the return of the vehicle
and refund the purchase price on the
basis that the “cooling off period” had ended. For present
purposes, the applicant’s
contemporaneous conduct seems to prove
conclusively that the applicant would not have purchased the vehicle had he not
been misled
as to its safety condition.
purchasing the vehicle, the applicant had some repairs done to it with a view to
making it roadworthy and safe to drive. The
applicant claims those expenses as
financial losses flowing from the misleading or false conduct. The costs
involved in repairing
mechanical defects to the vehicle in order to make it safe
to drive included the cost of obtaining temporary insurance on a vehicle
order to transport it to repairers. The costs of temporary insurance and
registration permits in addition to the costs of replacing
front and rear
springs and damaged tyres and the costs of obtaining roadworthy certificates or
tests to see whether the repairs have
been effective to make the vehicle
roadworthy are plainly financial losses incurred by the applicant.
am prepared to allow the applicant’s claim for $67.50 for RACQ insurance
permit, $19.50 for a registration permit, $60.90
for a one day insurance permit,
$19.50 for another registration permit, $610.00 for repairs at Brannigans Gold
Coast, $60.00 for
a failed roadworthy certificate inspection, $420.00 for
repairs at Beaurepairs Maroochydore, $450.00 for front springs at Pedders
Maroochydore and another $60.00 for the past roadworthy inspection at Yates Auto
Maroochydore.
applicant has also claimed for the costs of re-registering the vehicle and
obtaining compulsory third party insurance for it;
offsetting against that the
refund obtained from Queensland Transport when the registration was cancelled
for the vehicle it hadn’t
been found not to be roadworthy. I am not
satisfied that those parts of the claim are part of the financial loss that can
be recovered.
I do not propose to allow any amounts for either of the
registration or CTP insurance, or to deduct any amount for the refund received
for those amounts.
applicant has also claimed for travel costs for taking the vehicle to and from
repairs. As the vehicle was purchased on the Gold
Coast and the applicant
resides on the Sunshine Coast, some extensive travel seems to have been involved
in that process. The applicant
has also claimed amounts for his loss of income
during the 50 hours he spent attending to repairs of the vehicle and to the
prosecution
of this claim. Although the costs involved in pursuing the claim
might more properly be considered, the costs of this proceeding,
it makes little
difference to the final amount and I am prepared to allow the applicant the
total of $1,774.75 for his miscellaneous
costs of travel and time.
January of 2009 the applicant sold the vehicle to a friend for $15,000.00. The
respondents sought to challenge this sale. No
evidence was offered by the
applicant about any process engaged in, in relation to the sale, such as public
advertising. The sales
documentation appears to understate the dutiable value
of the car in the transaction. I accept the applicant’s evidence that
consulted the red book reference value of the vehicle at the time and found it
to be in the range of $14,000.00 to $17,000.00.
applicant had the use of the car for eight months and drove a total of about
8,000 kilometres during that period. I accept that
kilometres were related to the repair of the vehicle. Nonetheless, the
applicant did obtain some benefit from
his ownership of the vehicle during that
eight month period and that ought to be allowed for in assessing his financial
appears to me that the most sensible means in doing so and also for
addressing the respondents’ concerns about the value obtained
by the sale
of the vehicle is to adopt, for this purpose, a value at the upper end of the
red book reference range. Adopting a value
of $17,000.00 for the vehicle the
result is that the applicant suffered a further financial loss of $5,850.00 when
selling the vehicle.
this basis I find that applicant’s financial loss consists of three
elements: the costs of effecting repairs to the vehicle
totalling $1,767.40;
the applicant’s costs of travel and time in effecting those repairs at
$1,774.75; and the financial loss
on the sale of the vehicle of $5,850.50. So
that the applicant’s total financial loss is $9,392.65.
accordance with
section 530
of the Act. The Tribunal may make certain orders in
relation to a claim against the claim fund and the orders I propose to make
section 530(a)
of the Act, the claim by the applicant against the claim fund
is allowed in part.
section 488(3)(c)
of the Act, the amount of the applicant’s financial
loss suffered, because of the false or misleading representations by the
respondent and the second respondent as to the existence of a current safety
certificate for a motor vehicle, is nine thousand
three hundred and ninety-two
dollars and sixty-five cents
($9,392.65)
section 530(b)
of the Act, the first respondent and the second respondent are
named as the persons who are liable for the whole of the applicant’s
financial loss.
section 530(c)
of the Act, the chief executive is to pay to the applicant the
amount of nine thousand three hundred and ninety-two dollars and sixty-five
($9,392.65)
from the claim fund.
