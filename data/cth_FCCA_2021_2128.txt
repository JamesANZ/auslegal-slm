REASONS FOR
(Delivered ex tempore and revised from transcript)
JUDGE LUCEV
1 Before the Court is an application for judicial review (“Judicial
Review Application”) pursuant to
Migration Act 1958
Migration Ac
t”) of a decision of the Immigration
Assessment Authority (“Authority Decision” and
“Authority” respectively”)
filed on 15 November 2016. The
Authority Decision affirmed a decision of a delegate (“Delegate’s
Decision” and
“Delegate” respectively) of the first
respondent, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection
(“Minister”),
affirming the Delegate’s Decision not to grant
the applicant a Safe Haven Enterprise visa. The matter first came before a
of the Court on 10 May 2017 for directions at which time it was set
down for a final hearing on 9 October 2019 before then Judge
Wilson of this
2 It is common knowledge that there are significant delays in the hearing of
migration judicial review proceedings in the Melbourne
and Sydney Registries of
this Court, and this case is an example of that. The matter was further delayed
by the appointment of Judge
Wilson to the Family Court of Australia in or about
May of 2019. An email was sent to the parties on 9 May 2019 indicating that
upon Judge Wilson’s appointment to the Family Court of
Australia, the matter was adjourned sine die, pending the relisting
3 Recently, a significant number of the matters which have been delayed in
the Melbourne Registry have been allocated to judges of
this Court in other
registries, including the Perth Registry, and this is one of those matters.
Those matters have, for the most
part, been the subject of directions hearings
set down to ensure that the matter is in proper order to be listed for final
This matter is one of the matters which was so listed for a directions
hearing today.
4 The applicant does not appear today and the Minister reads the affidavit of
Lynette Yi Qi Dong, affirmed 31 August 2021. This affidavit
indicates that the
applicant held a relevant bridging visa up until the last bridging visa was
granted, it would appear, on 18 January
2017 and which has since ceased. That
affidavit also states that the relevant records of the relevant department
indicate that the
applicant departed Australia on 17 April 2021, and that the
deponent of the affidavit believes that the applicant is no longer in
having departed on that date, and does not hold a visa that would permit his
re-entry into Australia.
5 In those circumstances, it is appropriate that the application be dismissed
for non-appearance pursuant to r 13.03C(1)(c) of the
Federal Circuit Court
(Cth) as was submitted by the Minister. In those circumstances,
there will be an order to that effect. It is also appropriate in
circumstances that there be an order for costs as sought by the Minister, which
on the scale for a matter that has reached this
stage and has then been
dismissed for non-appearance, is a sum of $3,737.
