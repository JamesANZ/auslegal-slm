REASONS FOR ORDER
On 17 December 1998, Maddock Lonie and Chisholm, solicitors acting on behalf of
the Mitchell Shire Council, lodged with the Tribunal
an application for an
interim enforcement order under S.120 of the Act. Following an ex parte
hearing of the application on 18 December
1998, an interim enforcement order
was made by the Tribunal in the form annexed to this order. The Tribunal fixed
9.30am on 23 December
1998 as the time and place at which the respondents could
be heard in relation to the order.
By fax to the Tribunal on 21 December 1998, the applicant's solicitors advised
as follows :
"We refer to the Interim Enforcement Order granted by the Tribunal (Mr Ball) on
18 December 1998 in this matter.
The Tribunal has listed Council's application for (permanent) Enforcement Order
at 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday 23 December 1998.
We are pleased to advise that the occupier of the land has complied with the
Interim Enforcement Order to the satisfaction of Mitchell
Shire Council, and
that there is no longer a need for Council's application for Enforcement Order
to be heard by the Tribunal. Accordingly,
Mitchell Shire Council wishes to
withdraw its application for Enforcement Order".
The solicitors subsequently provided to the Tribunal a copy of a fax from one
of the respondents Paul Haynes confirming that
"I give permission for
Maddock Lonie and Chisholm to seek an interim enforcement order against the
Waterstock event".
In the circumstances, the Tribunal will make an order dismissing the
application for an enforcement order without a consideration
of the merits of
the application.
The Order of the Tribunal is that the application for an Enforcement Order
under S.114 of the Act is dismissed.
