APPEARANCES:
Not applicable
[1] For this application the Court, pursuant
Land Valuation Act 2010
(the LVA) must determine if it has
issued by the Valuer-General
on 15 August 2024. The subject property is located
within the Sunshine Coast Regional Council and comprises a 3.867 ha parcel with
an issued unimproved value of $370,000 as at 1 October 2023.
[2] The proposed
notice of appeal is recorded as having been filed on 14 November 2024. It is not
in dispute that the final day for
lodgement was 14 October 2024 at 4.30 pm.
Where a notice of appeal is not filed within the appeal period, the Court will
have jurisdiction
to hear and determine the appeal, only if a “reasonable
excuse” as required by
of the LVA is established by the
[3] On 18 November 2024 a Deputy-Registrar wrote to Miracleside Pty
Ltd (the applicant) to advise that the 60-day period for the lodgement
notice of appeal appeared to have expired on 14 October 2024. The letter
enclosed an extract of
of the LVA and advised that the appeal
could only be heard if the Court was satisfied that there was a reasonable
excuse for not
filing the notice within the appeal period.
[4] On 3 December
2024, the Court made directions for filing affidavit material and submissions.
The directions also provided for
the application to be determined on the
material filed without an oral hearing unless the parties requested
Legislation
Section 157
(2) of the LVA provides:
section 158
, an appeal cannot be started after 60 days after the day
of issue stated in the objection decision notice (the
Section 158
of the LVA provides:
“158 - Late filing
(1) This section applies if a valuation appeal notice is filed after the
appeal period has ended.
(2) The Land Court can hear the appeal only if—
(a) the valuation appeal notice was filed 1 year or less after the objection
decision notice was issued; and
(b) the appellant satisfies the court there was a reasonable excuse for not
filing the notice within the appeal period.
Example of reasonable excuse—
The notice of the valuer-general’s decision or the valuation appeal
notice was lost or delayed in the ordinary course of post.”
[7] For completeness it is noted that
of the LVA does not
provide any power for the Court to extend the appeal period in anticipation of
events or circumstances that might
subsequently occasion a delay in lodging an
[8] On behalf of the applicant, an affidavit by the
Chief Executive Officer, Mr Ross
was filed on 18 December 2024. The affidavit attached six exhibits comprising
letters from Mr Little to the Land Court dated 15
December 2024, to the
Department of Transport and Main Roads dated 4 June 2024 and to the
Valuer-General dated 5 June 2024. Further
exhibits included a letter from the
Department of Main Roads to Mr Little dated 27 September 1996; two letters from
the applicant’s
then solicitors to the Department of Main Roads dated 23
February 2000 and 16 October 2000, a letter from the Department of Main
the applicant’s solicitors dated 19 December 2000. The final exhibit
included a two-page letter from a valuation
firm dated 7 March 2013 to Mr Little
and the applicant.
[9] No affidavit or other evidence was filed on behalf of
the Valuer-General.
Applicant’s submissions
[10] Although no formal
submission document has been filed on behalf of the applicant, the letter to the
Land Court dated 15 December
Mr Little makes the following points extracted below:
• I had written
to the Land Court before the document cut-off date asking for an extension of
time to present some 200 pages
of evidence regarding the multiple variations of
(a) The valuer-general 2024 $ 370,000
Co-or-Gen 2009 (sic) $ 5,000
(c) MRD 1999 $
(d) Energex paid $27,000 for 15 000 sqm of easement value
• There has been deliberate destruction, deceit and in my
view fraud occurring.
• When I wrote to the Court asking for an
extension, I expected to present some 200 pages of evidence, on reflection there
probably more than 600 pages from 30 or more Senior Public Servants,
Ministers and highly qualified professionals if I have to explain
deceit etc.
• It would be impossible to assemble all the evidence in
such a short time given the conditions I'm working under. The Co-Ordinator
General’s (DIP) is Queensland’s most powerful State Government
Office and must be listened to.
• I'm tabling two letters that may
explain the amount of documents needed to prove the whole case. Annex B & C
VG) The MRD letter was written in about 2019 the computer
accidentally re dated it.
• I'm tabling five letters linking the
Minister's letter of promise to the taking of the resumption which reflects the
value of the land should the Court rule that the valuation is subject to
legal access being returned to the land and an independent
view on the matters
(letters D,E,F,G & H).
• It’s impossible to complete the
evidence within Court time constraint.
• This matter needs to go to the
court that can order that the resumptions are to be done again in a legally
compliant matter
so that the Valuer-General assessment will be correct. As it
stands now the site is a worthless liability.
Respondent’s submissions
[11] A summary of the Valuer-General’s submission is set out in the
following points:
• As the applicant has not established a reasonable
excuse for not filing the appeal notice within the statutory appeal period,
Court does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal.
no representations were made to the applicant about any change in time limits or
how to file the material, there is no
• The applicant was aware of the date that the appeal had to be
filed and did not file it by the deadline. The LVA sets this
timeline to balance
the need for efficiency in the Court process and appellants having sufficient
time to file material. This excuse
is not reasonable and would be an undesirable
• The applicant did not do everything a reasonable person
would have done in the circumstances to have the appeal filed on time
reason for the delay was not such that it was beyond the control of the
Matters in reply by the applicant
[12] A summary of the
relevant matters raised in reply by Mr Little on behalf of the applicant is set
• Given the amount of evidence required it was necessary to
allow the time taken.
• The applicant wrote to the Land Court on 20
August 2024 applying for an Appeal Form 3 in a timely manner.
to a Land Court Deputy-Registrar explaining that the evidence being compiled is
substantial, indisputable and must be
recognised. The letter also asks for an
extension of time till January 2025. The extension has never been

phone calls and meetings between the applicant and the Land Court
in a timely
• On 30 October 2024 the applicant wrote to the Land Court
Senior-Registrar providing evidence etc.
[13] A finding of
reasonable excuse requires cogent evidence of facts and circumstances that
demonstrate how that cause or excuse
operated to preclude the filing of the
notice of appeal within the 60-day period. Without such evidence, a Court cannot
any chain of events or factual basis upon which a reasonable excuse
might be based.
[14] The question of reasonable excuse was considered in
Pascoe v The Nominal Defendant (Qld) No
with Mansfield CJ stating as follows:
“What is to be determined is whether the applicant has shown any cause
which can be deemed by the court to be a reasonable excuse.
I think this means a
cause which a reasonable person would regard as an excuse, a cause consistent
with a reasonable standard of
conduct, the kind of thing which might be expected
to delay the giving of notice by a reasonable
[15] The Land Appeal Court in AG Russell v The
, had this to
say regarding reasonable excuse:
“Whilst it has been laid down that each case depends on its own
particular facts, it is clear from the above authorities that
the reasonable
cause or explanation must be substantial. The test is an objective one. It is of
little use for an appellant for example,
merely to say without more that he did
not know of the time limitation, or that he had overlooked duly complying with
the prescribed
requirements of
s.44(11)(a)
and (b), or that he believed that
what he did amounted to due compliance. The Land Appeal Court must be satisfied
that there is a
reasonable cause or
explanation.”
[16] The evidence and materials before the Court in support of
this application provide limited detail as to why between 200 to 600
were required in order to complete the notice of appeal; a document that does
not have any requirement to concurrently
provide the evidence that might be
relied upon at the subsequent hearing of the appeal. The evidence does not, on
balance, demonstrate
any reasonable excuse or cause, or explain how the absence
of the documents prevented the filing of the notice as required by

established on behalf of the applicant and therefore must find that

application is refused.
2. The Court does not have jurisdiction to hear and
determine the appeal.
