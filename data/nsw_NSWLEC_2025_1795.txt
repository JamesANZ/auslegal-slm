COMMISSIONER
At 205 Picton Road, Picton, Multiquip Poultry Pty Ltd (Multiquip) operates a
hatchery, where eggs that are delivered to the site
are incubated and then sold
as food chickens upon hatching. With Australians eating more chicken than any
other meat, business is
going well and Multiquip seeks development consent for a
new maintenance shed, office building, and hardstand area for truck and
parking, to support its ongoing operation. A development application was lodged
with the respondent on 27 February 2023,
which was refused on 2 October 2024.
Multiquip appeals against that decision, pursuant to
Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979
(NSW) (EPA Act). In
exercising the functions of the consent authority on the appeal, the Court has
the power to determine the development
application pursuant to ss 4.15 and 4.16
of the EPA Act. The final orders in this appeal, outlined in [
] below, are made as a
result of an agreement between the parties that was reached at a conciliation
conference.
an adjournment of the hearing, the Court arranged a conciliation conference
Land and Environment Court Act 1979
(NSW) (LEC Act)
between the parties, which was held on 4 November 2025. I presided over the
conciliation conference.
the conciliation conference, an agreement under s 34(3) of the LEC Act was
reached between the parties as to the terms of a decision
in the proceedings
that was acceptable to the parties. The agreement was filed the same day, and
follows the Council’s approval
of an application for an amendment to a
development application pursuant to
Environmental Planning
and Assessment Regulation 2021
(NSW). The amendments include lowering the pitch
and height of the maintenance shed, reducing the number of maintenance bays,
widened driveways and pedestrian paths, and providing an updated
traffic and parking assessment report to address the interaction
between the
proposed development and an existing transport depot that operates on the
decision agreed upon is for the grant of development consent subject to
conditions of consent pursuant to s 4.16(1) of the EPA
Act. The signed agreement
is supported by a statement of Jurisdictional Pre-requisites that sets out the
to the exercise of the power to grant development
consent (the Jurisdictional Statement). I have considered the contents of the
together with the documents referred to therein, the Class 1
Application and its attachments, the documents referred to in the signed
agreement, the assessment report dated 2 October 2024, and the documents that
are referred to in condition 2 of Annexure A to the
agreement. Based on those
documents, I have considered the matters required to be considered pursuant to s
4.15(1) of the EPA Act.
the presiding Commissioner, I am satisfied that the decision to grant
development consent to the amended application subject to
conditions of consent
is a decision that the Court could have made in the proper exercise of its
functions, this being the test applied
by s 34(3) of the LEC Act. This test is
concerned with there being no jurisdictional constraints that preclude the
making of orders
in accordance with the decision that the parties’ have
agreed upon (see
McMillan v Taylor
(2023) 111 NSWLR 634
[2023] NSWCA 183
, [51]). I formed this state of satisfaction as each of the jurisdictional
preconditions identified by the parties is met, for the
(1) The development works are for the purposes of agriculture and transport
depot, which are both nominated permissible uses in the
RU2 Rural Landscape zone
in which the site is located, pursuant to the Wollondilly Local Environmental
Plan 2011 (WLEP).
(2) Clause 5.18 of the WLEP applies to development for the purpose of intensive
livestock agriculture, and therefore applies to the
proposed development. Based
on the Jurisdictional Statement and the Statement of Environmental Effects dated
18 October 2023, and
the documents referred to therein, I have taken into
consideration the matters in
cl 5.18(3) of the WLEP.
(3) Services for the supply of water, electricity and the disposal of sewage are
already available on the site, and therefore the
requirements of cl 7.1 of the
WLEP concerning essential services are satisfied.
(4) The development application includes earthworks for the
levelling of the site for the maintenance shed and hardstand area. Based
the letter dated 17 October 2025 prepared by Idealgeotech and the Cut and
Fill Plan dated 15 October 2025, I have considered the
matters set out in
7.5(3) of the WLEP.
(5) Clause 7.9 of the WLEP concerns development on land identified as
metropolitan rural area, and applies to the site. Based on
the Jurisdictional
Statement, the Statement of Environmental Effects dated 18 October 2023 and the
Supplementary Information to the
Statement of Environmental Effects dated 7
October 2025, I have considered the matters in cl 7.9(3).
(6) Consideration has been given as to whether the subject site is contaminated
as required by s 4.6 of the State Environmental Planning
Policy (Resilience and
Hazards) 2021. Based on the Statement of Environmental Effects dated 20 August
2025, the site’s history
has been reviewed, and the site is unlikely to be
contaminated. An isolated stockpile on the site, Stockpile 1, was identified as
exceeding the ESL criteria for Benzo(a)pyrene, and is required by the agreed
conditions of consent (at condition 9) to be removed
from the site and disposed
of at a licensed waste facility.
(7) The site has frontage to Picton Road, which is a classified road, and
2.119 of State Environmental Planning Policy (Transport and Infrastructure) 2021
(SEPP TI) applies. Vehicular access could not
be obtained from a road other than
the classified road, and, based on the Traffic and Parking Assessment Report
dated 8 October 2025,
I am satisfied that the safety, efficiency, and ongoing
operation of the classified road will not be adversely affected by the
development
as a result of the vehicular access or the emissions from the
development. Consistent with the requirements of s 2.119(2)(c), the
development is not of a type that is sensitive to traffic noise or vehicle
(8) The proposed development is traffic-generating development to which s 2.122
of the SEPP TI applies. Consistent with the requirements
of s 2.122(4),
Transport for NSW was notified of the development application, and I have taken
into consideration their submission
in response, which is dated 7 August 2024.
Further, based on the Traffic and Parking Assessment Report dated 8 October
2025, I have
considered the matters required to be considered by s
2.122(4)(b)(ii) and (iii) of the SEPP TI.
(9) The proposed development could affect an electricity power line or an
electricity distribution pole, as a result of which s 2.48
of the SEPP
TI requires notification to the electricity supply authority and consideration
of their response. Consistent with those
requirements, Endeavour Energy was
notified of the development application and I have considered the
content of their most recent
response, dated 9 October 2025.
(10) The site falls within the Hawkesbury-Napean River Catchment, such that Pt
6.2 of the State Environmental Planning Policy (Biodiversity
Conservation) 2021 applies to the development application. Based on the
stormwater management plans and accompanying water quality
assessment dated 15
October 2025, the Jurisdictional Statement, and the Statement of Environmental
Effects dated 20 August 2025,
I am satisfied of the matters in ss
6.6(2) and 6.7(2). Further, the development will not change any public access to
recreational
areas of waterbodies, and I am therefore satisfied of the matters
in s 6.9(2).
(11) The development application was notified from 3 March 2023 to 31 March
2023, and there were no written submissions received
during the period of
notification.
Amended Statement of Facts and Contentions notes that the proposal is integrated
development pursuant to
Water Management Act 2000
development application was referred to the Department of Planning and
Environment, who indicated, in correspondence dated
3 May 2023, that a
controlled activity approval is not required for the proposed development.
site is located within the Wilton Mine Subsidence District and requires the
concurrence of the Subsidence Advisory pursuant to
Subsidence Compensation Act 2017
. The Subsidence Advisory issued general
terms of approval dated 9 November 2023, which have been incorporated into the
agreed conditions
of consent, at condition 4.
reached the state of satisfaction that the decision is one that the Court could
have made in the exercise of its functions,
s 34(3)(a) of the LEC Act requires
me to “dispose of the proceedings in accordance with the decision”.
The LEC Act also
requires me to “set out in writing the terms of the
(s 34(3)(b)).
making the orders to give effect to the agreement between the parties, I was not
required to make, and have not made, any evaluative
judgment on the matters that
were originally in dispute between the parties, or any assessment of the merits
of the development application
against the discretionary matters that arise
pursuant to an assessment under s 4.15 of the EPA Act.
