REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is an application for an extension of time for the bringing of a claim against
the fund under
section 470
Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act
has been an appreciable delay in making the claim.
Fraudulent conduct is alleged against the respondent real estate agent who acted
in the sale of a residential house property at Thornlands
to the applicant on 21
November 2005 for a price of $549,000.00.
November 2007 the applicant was told by Mr Anderson (who apparently controlled
the vendor) that the true price had been $460,000.00
and that he had paid
approximately $79,000.00 of this to the respondent. The applicant then asked
the agents to repay the money,
but they denied wrongdoing and have never repaid
the following month, December 2007, the applicant resold the property for
$530,000.00.
February 2008 the applicant made a complaint to the Office of Fair Trading
(“OFT”) concerning the respondent’s
conduct and became aware
that there was a “
”. He was thereafter in contact
with officers from the OFT and also the Department of Justice. On 15 April 2008
from that department, Richard Tarczynski, told the applicant that a
claim was not available because it was an “investment property”.
applicant says that but for that advice he would have brought a claim at that
time, which would have been within the statutory
limitation period
(section 472
considerable time later, on 2 June 2009, the applicant states that he received a
letter from an officer in the OFT, namely Kate
Harten, which suggested that a
claim against the fund would be possible. The letter has not been supplied to
me and I am unaware
of the basis upon which such a statement may have been made.
I may say however that on the material available to me it seems probable
the earlier advice of Mr Tarczynski was correct.
the event, a formal claim was lodged in the Tribunal on 17 August 2009.
determining whether to extend time, the prospects of ultimate success are a
relevant consideration.
is little doubt that the applicant has been the victim of a scam engineered by
the respondent and her husband.
respondent, Tone Munro, has been duly served by post.
applicant has produced substantial evidence to support his claim that
There was an elaborate conspiracy between Tone Munro and
Confam Valuations, and/or Tone Munro and ALS and Confam Valuations to inflate
property valuations so that loans higher then the value of the property could be
issued. The Munro’s would then skim the excess

settlement.
conduct, if eventually proven, would substantiate claims based on one or more of
sections 573
of PADMA, all of which are relevant
contraventions for the purpose of
section 470.
on the information currently available, I do not think that the claim qualifies
as being in relation to the purchase by the
applicant of a
non-investment residential property
includes among the persons who can
claim on the fund
“a person who suffers financial loss because of, or
arising out of, a marketeering contravention in relation to the purchase
person of a residential property (other than a non-investment residential
conduct in question by the respondent would seem to meet the definition of a
marketeering contravention (see
the term “non-investment residential property” is defined in
as follows –
“469A What is the purchase of a non-investment
residential property
A person purchases a
non-investment residential property
(a) the property is a residential property; and
(b) either of the following has been assessed in relation to the
(i) a concession, under the
Duties Act 2001
, chapter 2,
transfer duty;
(ii) a concession, under the repealed Stamp Act 1894, section 55A, for
stamp duty.”
is no evidence before me that suggests that the situation was one in which the
applicant obtained a concession under the
in relation to the
purchase. The surrounding circumstances reveal that the applicant lived in New
Zealand and already owned a valuable
His instructions to his solicitors were to hold the property as bare trustee for
The Shane Philpott Family Trust
” and a declaration of
trustee was executed by him in relation to the purchase. The accounting
documents show that stamp duty
of $9,139.15 was paid to the commissioner of
stamp duties. In his statement of 4 August 2009, the applicant states
initially I rented the house out with the plan of relocating to
Australia and moving into the house in a few years tim
evidence is not conclusive, but it suggests that this was an investment
property, rather than a non-investment residential property.
applicant can produce evidence of a relevant concession having been assessed
ct based upon a true declaration, I cannot see how he
can successfully maintain a claim against the fund. The surrounding
circumstances
make it difficult to think that a true declaration could have been
made entitling the applicant to a relevant concession under the
would add that even if this hurdle is surmounted, the quantum of the claim that
may be made will be considerably less than the $116,085.00
that has been
claimed. For reasons given hereunder it would be limited to the capital loss on
the on-sale.
of PAMDA states:
“471A Claims limited to realised loss
(1) A person may make a claim against the fund for financial loss
relating to a non-investment residential property purchased by
because of, or arising out of, a marketeering contravention only to the extent
the loss is capital loss.
(2) Also, capital loss mentioned in subsection (1) may be claimed only if
the loss has been realised as mentioned in section 488B.”
488B provides:
“488B General test for working out loss
(1) Subject to section 488C, the financial loss is the amount of the
difference between the contract price or value for the property
paid by the
claimant and the contract price or value for the sale of the property by the
claimant (the
(2) The loss is only realised if the on-sale has been
completed.”
Act would therefore severely limit the amount that could successfully be claimed
in the present matter.
the information available to me the claim does not appear to qualify as one that
could succeed. However, in case the applicant
can satisfy section 469A by
showing that a concession was properly assessed under the
in relation
to the sale, I will leave the door open for the applicant to renew the present
application if so advised..
will be ordered that the application for extension of time is dismissed, but,
leave will be granted to reapply if further evidence
