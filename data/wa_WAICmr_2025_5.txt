sought an extension of time to deal with the internal review to 31 July 2023,
which the complainant agreed to. However,
the agency did not provide an
internal review decision by the agreed date.
The agency subsequently gave
the complainant an internal review decision dated 5 September 2023. The
agency identified two emails,
together with their attachments (collectively
the disputed documents
), within the scope of the access application. The
agency refused the complainant access to the disputed documents on the ground
they were exempt under clause 7(1) of Schedule 1 to the FOI Act (
). In addition, the agency claimed that one attachment to one of the
emails was also exempt under clause 1(1) of Schedule 1 to the
On 14 September 2023, the complainant applied to the
Information Commissioner (
Commissioner
) for external review of the
agency’s decision and provided submissions claiming the disputed documents
were not exempt as claimed.
The agency provided the Commissioner with its FOI
file maintained in respect of the access application, together with a copy of
the disputed documents.
On 10 January 2025, one of the
Commissioner’s officers provided the complainant with her assessment of
the matter. It was the
officer’s assessment that the Commissioner was
likely to consider, based on the information then before her, that the
decision to refuse access to the disputed documents was
The complainant did not accept the assessment and requested
that the Commissioner provide a decision on the matter. The complainant
reiterated its submissions provided with its application for external
Clause 7(1) provides that matter is exempt if it would be
privileged from production in legal proceedings on the ground of legal
professional
privilege. The grounds upon which a document is subject to legal
professional privilege are fairly well settled in Australian common
In brief, legal professional privilege protects from disclosure

communications were made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal
advice or the provision of legal services,
including representation in
proceedings in a court:
Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Federal Commissioner
of Taxation
[1999] HCA 67
(1999) 201 CLR 49
The disputed
documents consist of an email from the Office of the Premier to the State
Solicitor’s Office, with an attachment,
and an email from the State
Solicitor’s Office to the Premier and other Ministers, with
attachments.
The Commissioner examined the disputed documents and
considered the submissions made by the parties and the applicable law in
to legal professional privilege. The Commissioner was satisfied that
the disputed documents were confidential communications between
a legal adviser
and their client made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal
advice or the provision of legal services,
as described in
As a result, the Commissioner was satisfied that the disputed documents
would be privileged from production in legal proceedings on
the ground of legal
professional privilege and that they were, therefore, exempt under clause 7(1).
The complainant submitted that consideration should be given to whether
legal professional privilege had been waived. The Commissioner
noted that her
role in deciding whether documents are exempt under clause 7(1) is
restricted to a consideration of whether they would
be, on their face,
privileged from production in legal proceedings:
Department of Housing and
Works v Bowden
[2005] WASC 123.
As a result, it was not open to the
Commissioner to consider the question of waiver.
The complainant
contended that consideration should be given to whether disclosure of the
disputed documents was in the public interest.
Under the FOI Act, legal
professional privilege is an absolute exemption, and no public interest test
arises in respect of clause
7(1). Therefore, the Commissioner noted that
it was not open to her to consider the public interest.
The complainant
also argued that consideration should be given to whether access could be given
to an edited copy of the disputed
documents with the exempt matter deleted,
pursuant to section 24 of the FOI Act. As the Commissioner was satisfied the
documents are exempt in their entirety, she considered it was not
practicable for the agency to give access to a copy of the disputed
with the exempt matter deleted: Scott J in
Police Force of Western Australia
v Winterton
(Unreported, Supreme Court of WA, Library No 970646, 27 November
1997), at page 16. As a result, the Commissioner considered that
the obligation
under section 24 did not apply.
The Commissioner found that the
disputed documents were exempt under clause 7(1) and confirmed the
agency’s decision.
In light of that finding, it was not necessary
for the Commissioner to consider the agency’s clause 1(1) exemption claim
she did not do so.
