This second edition of the
International Journal of Social Security and
Workers Compensation
builds on the foundation laid in the first edition to
promote a genuinely international dialogue of issues relating to social security
support systems and workers compensation. The journal encourages
discipline-specific, multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary studies,
as studies of particular jurisdictions and comparative studies, especially
studies involving multiple countries, regions
or sub-national political
divisions (such as provinces or states). In this second edition we have again
set out to achieve these
aims with papers from a range of disciplines and
The first two papers concern particular dimensions of return-to-work (RTW)
programmes, in relation to workers suffering from an occupational
disease. In their contribution, Dörte Bernhard and Ellen MacEachen,
together with Professor Katherine Lippel, consider
the legal context in which
Disability Management Professionals (DMPs) in Ontario, Canada work, how this
affects their daily practice,
and how this impacts their training curricula.
They conclude that DMPs’ practice is affected by the local legal context:
management practices may differ from one jurisdiction to the next,
which therefore emphasises the need to consider socio-political
DMPs’ practice as well as in the development of training programmes and
cross-jurisdictional research. Marina Ciccarelli
and Jessica Dender discuss
unique challenges, due to issues of geographic distance, work cultures and
limited availability of alternative
job duties, faced by workplace
rehabilitation providers working in rural and remote regions in Western
Australia in implementing
early RTW interventions. Some of the factors
restricting early RTW interventions are reflected on and possible strategies to
these hurdles are suggested.
Professor Terry Carney and Associate Professor Gaby Ramia critically evaluate
recent changes introduced in Australia regarding welfare
support and sanctions
for non-compliance, in the wake of a recessionary world labour market and
against a comparative background.
They observe that the changes indicate the
potential for greater emphasis on among others social protection and social
values. However, their analysis suggests that the recent partial
softening of the impact of Australia’s former neoliberal model
unemployment payments has only partially succeeded in achieving this. Professor
Robert Guthrie, Robert Aurbach and Andrew Fronsko
review the literature in
relation to the effects of economic downturn on workers’ compensation
schemes, drawing on international
studies. They conclude that whilst the
research dealing with the relationship between economic downturn and claims
behaviour has
doubtful predictive value in relation to workers’
compensation matters, it is possible that some of the learning from this
study can be applied to occupational health and safety issues.
In the first of two contributions on the human rights position of irregular
migrants, particularly from a social security perspective,
Professor Ockert
Dupper indicates that around the world, irregular migrants are often excluded
from basic social rights. He asserts
that developments at the international and
the regional level, as well as legal and policy developments in a number of
countries around the world, indicate that there may be a movement
away from an approach that focuses exclusively on the security
irregular migration to a more nuanced approach that also places significant
emphasis on the human rights of irregular
migrants. The paper by Professor
Robert Brown makes a valuable contribution to the debate on important selection
criteria which should
inform the optimal design and financing of social security
retirement systems. It discusses these criteria and for each criterion,
paper lists and discusses advantages and disadvantages of the options
This peer-reviewed electronic journal is designed to be of service both to
the academic community and to practitioners in social security
and workers
compensation. It seeks to publish articles, notes and comments. It therefore
welcomes scientific contributions of an
analytical, theoretical or applied
nature from the academic community and practitioners in any relevant discipline.
The journal in
particular welcomes contributions on innovative approaches in the
areas of social security and workers compensation. Contributions
dealing with
issues of policy and reform are also encouraged. Further information on the
Journal, including submission guidelines
for authors, is available on the
Journal’s website, accessible at
