COMMISSIONER
This appeal concerns a development control order issued by Waverley Council on
14 July 2025 (the order). The order was issued pursuant
Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979
(NSW) (EPA Act), which
allows a development control order to be given in accordance with the table to
of Sch 5 to the EPA Act. The order is a repair order, issued pursuant to
Item 5 of Pt 1 of Sch 5. It requires the applicant to repair
a retaining wall on
land at 45-47 Roscoe Street, Bondi Beach. Item 5 allows a repair order to be
issued where a building is so dilapidated
that it is prejudicial to the
occupants, persons or property in the neighbourhood. The applicant appeals
against the order pursuant
to s 8.18 of the EPA Act. The final orders on the
appeal, which modify the order, are made as a result of an agreement between the
parties that was reached at a conciliation conference.
Court arranged a conciliation conference under
Environment Court Act 1979
(NSW) (LEC Act) between the parties, which was
held on 18 September 2025 and continued on 25 September and 15 October 2025. I
over the conciliation conference.
the conciliation conference, an agreement under s 34(3) of the LEC Act was
reached between the parties as to the terms of
a decision in the proceedings
that was acceptable to the parties. The final signed agreement was filed on 29
October 2025. The agreement
is for the order to be modified so as to specify the
scope of works to be carried out to repair the retaining
The power to make orders in accordance with the
make orders in accordance with the agreement, I must be satisfied that the
decision to make orders to modify the order in the agreed
terms is a decision
that the Court can make in the proper exercise of its functions (this being the
test applied by s 34(3) of the
modified order remains a repair order, requiring repairs and structural
alterations to the retaining wall. Item 5 of Pt 1 of Sch
5 to the EPA Act allows
a development control order to be issued as a repair order to an owner of the
building if “the building
is or is likely to become a danger to the public
or is so dilapidated that it is prejudicial to the occupants, persons or
in the neighbourhood.” The parties agree that the retaining wall
is in such a state, at present, that it is a risk of collapse
unless structural
work is undertaken, which is the subject of a scope of works prepared by George
Zanbaka dated 25 September 2025.
Therefore, there is power to issue the order to
repair or make structural alterations to the retaining wall.
addition, s 8.18(4) of the EPA Act gives the Court broad powers on an appeal
against an order. Those powers are as follows:
(4) On hearing an appeal, the Court may:
(a) revoke the development control order, or
(b) modify the development control order, or
(c) substitute for the development control order any other order that the
relevant enforcement authority who gave the order could
have given, or
(d) find that the development control order is sufficiently complied with,
(e) make such order with respect to compliance with the development control
order as the Court thinks fit, or
(f) make such other order with respect to the development control order as the
Court thinks fit.
am satisfied that the decision to make orders to modify the order in the terms
agreed to by the parties is a decision that the Court
can make in the proper
exercise of its functions (this being the test applied by s 34(3) of the LEC
Act), for the reason that s 8.18(4)(b)
of the EPA Act gives the Court the power,
on the hearing of the appeal, to modify the development control order.
reached the state of satisfaction that the decision agreed upon is a decision
that the Court could make in the exercise of
its functions in each of the appeal
proceedings, s 34(3)(a) of the LEC Act requires me to “dispose of the
proceedings in accordance
with the decision”. The LEC Act also requires me
to “set out in writing the terms of the decision” (s 34(3)(b)).
making order to give effect to the agreement between the parties, I was not
required to make, and have not made, any assessment
of the merits of the issues
that were originally in dispute between the
Court orders that:
(1) The appeal is upheld.
(2) Pursuant to
s 8.18(4)(b)
Environmental Planning and Assessment Act
(NSW), the Court modifies Development Control Order (Ref: NO-6675)
issued by the Respondent to the Applicant on 7 May 2024 in accordance
Modified Development Control Order at Annexure A.
(3) Each party is to bear its own costs of the proceedings.
