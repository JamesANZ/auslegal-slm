REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
, revised from transcript)
interlocutory application dated 29 September 2025, the appellant applies for
orders that each of us recuse ourselves on the grounds
of apprehended bias and
further, that the hearing of the application be determined by a differently
constituted bench of the Full
are unanimously of the view that the usual practice where applications of
apprehended bias are made is that they will be dealt
with by the trial judge or,
in this case, by the appeal court. Helpfully, the appellant has drawn attention
to the summary expression
of principle in
Ogbonna v CTI Logistics Limited (No
[2022] FCA 612 (Colvin
J) at [21] where his Honour relevantly observed in
Although it is usual practice for such applications to be dealt with by the
judge (with any complaint about the judge's decision
to be pursued by way of
appeal), there may be instances where the nature of the claim is such that it is
appropriate in the first
instance for the application to be considered by
another judge. That is especially so where the claim made concerns the manner in
which determinations have been made by the judge in the course of ongoing
proceedings between the same parties.
then continuing at [22], his Honour referenced that any decision to refer the
application to another judge “should not be
the usual course” by
reference to the unfairness to other parties caused by delay and additional
costs, the process for the
selection of judicial officers and the seriousness
that judges place on obedience to the judicial oath as providing adequate
protection.
in the joint reasons of Kiefel CJ, Gageler, Keane, Gordon and Gleeson JJ in
Charisteas v Charisteas
[2021] HCA 29
(2021) 273 CLR 289
observed that:
As five judges of this Court said in Johnson v Johnson, while the fair-minded
lay observer “is not to be assumed to have a
detailed knowledge of the
law, or of the character or ability of a particular judge, the reasonableness of
any suggested apprehension
of bias is to be considered in the context of
ordinary judicial practice”.
our view, ordinary practice requires that this Court, as constituted, determine
the recusal application.
