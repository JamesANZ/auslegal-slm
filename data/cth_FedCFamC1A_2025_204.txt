REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
INTRODUCTION
is an appeal from final orders made by a judge of the Federal Circuit and Family
Court of Australia (Division 2) on 24 March
2025 (“Orders”) pursuant
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth) (“Act”).
proceeding was listed for trial commencing on 28 October 2024 and thereafter
proceeded over four days, between 29–30 October
and 18–19 November
the last day of the trial, final orders were made by consent that provided,
, for the respondent mother to have sole decision-making
responsibility for all major long-term issues regarding the children, X,
2016, and Y, born in 2019, and for them to live with her.
remaining issues reserved for determination by the primary judge that day
included, primarily, what time, if any, was to be spent
between the appellant
father and the children. The respondent, supported by the Independent
Children’s Lawyer, primarily sought
that the children spend no time and
have no communication with the appellant, save for the provision of presents,
cards and letters
on specified special occasions. The appellant sought,
, that the children spend time with him in alternate weekends and during
school holidays.
the result, the Orders provide that the children spend no time with the
appellant and have no communication with him, other than
that he be permitted to
send them presents, together with a card or letter, for their birthdays,
Christmas and Easter each year.
is an appeal from a discretionary decision. Accordingly, error of the type
identified in
House v The King
(1936) 55 CLR 499
at 504–505 must be
established. There, the majority of the High Court said:
It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if
they had been in the position of the primary judge,
they would have taken a
different course. It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the
discretion. If the judge
acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or
irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he
not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should
be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise
its own discretion in
substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how
the primary judge has reached
the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the
facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that
in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which
the law reposes in the court of first instance. In
such a case, although the
nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is
reviewed on the ground that
a substantial wrong has in fact occurred. ...
amended Notice of Appeal comprises 11 grounds, of which two were abandoned at
the commencement of the hearing of the appeal.
1, 4 and 6 assert a denial of procedural fairness. In particular, Ground 1
contends that the primary judge erred in conducting
the proceedings, in part, in
the absence of the appellant, whilst he was self-represented, thereby denying
him procedural fairness
and resulting in a miscarriage of justice. Grounds 4 and
6, which overlap and are inter-related with Ground 1, contend that, in not
ordering a psychiatric assessment of the appellant, nor affording him the
opportunity to adduce psychiatric evidence, which was discussed
in part in his
absence, he was denied procedural fairness.
of appeal in relation to procedural fairness are challenges to the integrity of
the administration of justice, and thus should
be dealt with first, before other
discrete grounds of appeal:
Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design &
Developments Pty Ltd
[2006] HCA 55
(2006) 229 CLR 577
–[2], [117], [172];
Royal Guardian Mortgage Management Pty Ltd v Nguyen
(2016) 332 ALR 128 at
Krupin & Krupin
[2022] FedCFamC1A 136
–[37], Tree J
said, on appeal:
failure to afford procedural fairness is an error of law (
Goldie v Minister
for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs
[1999] FCA 1277
(1999) 56 ALD 321).
fairness requires each party to be given an adequate opportunity to be heard,
and to present their cases (
Kioa v West
[1985] HCA 81
(1985) 159 CLR 550
However, it is only the opportunity to present evidence and argument which the
interests of justice requires, not the actuality
of it. Thus where a party has
had a sufficient opportunity to put forward his or her case, it may be necessary
for the court to make
a decision for the sake of doing justice to the other
party and to other litigants (
Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian
National University
(2009) 239 CLR 174 (“
the commencement of the hearing, counsel for the respondent properly conceded
that any denial of procedural fairness, if established,
would be dispositive of
the appeal.
the Orders the subject of the appeal accord with those sought or supported by
the Independent Children’s Lawyer at
trial, the Independent
Children’s Lawyer filed a Submitting Notice on 6 August 2025, which was
preceded by a Summary of Argument
filed on 1 August 2025, in which she
substantially supports the appeal and, in particular, joins with the appellant
insofar as the
grounds asserting a denial of procedural fairness are concerned.
Notwithstanding her Submitting Notice, the Independent Children’s
was represented by counsel at the hearing of the appeal.
the reasons which follow, the appeal will be allowed and the matter remitted for
retrial by a judge of the of the Federal Circuit
and Family Court of Australia
(Division 2), other than the primary judge.
28 October 2024, being the first day on which the proceeding was listed for
trial, the appellant was legally represented by solicitor
and counsel, by reason
of an order having previously been made pursuant to
of the Act. The
matter was stood down for the day for negotiations. Although not readily
apparent from the transcript, final property
orders were, in fact, made by
consent later that day.
the morning of the second day, 29 October 2024, the appellant’s legal
representatives sought and were granted leave to withdraw,
self-represented that and the following day. After recording this fact at [13]
of her reasons for judgment (“reasons”),
the primary judge then
accordance with
Johnson & Johnson
[2000] HCA 48
(2000) 201 CLR 488
F Litigants In Person Guidelines
[2001] FamCA 348
, the court process was
thoroughly explained to the father and every attempt was made to ensure that
fair process was afforded to
the father.
reason of the
order, the appellant was unable to cross-examine the
respondent, who was the applicant at trial. She was the only witness in her
case. She was cross-examined briefly by counsel for the Independent
Children’s Lawyer and, thereafter, the primary judge posed
some questions
to her that the appellant sought to be asked. See reasons at [15].
Cross-examination
of the appellant by counsel for the respondent commenced that afternoon and
continued and concluded in the course
of the following morning, on 30 October
Thereafter,
cross-examination of the appellant by counsel for the Independent
Children’s Lawyer commenced at 11.48am and concluded
at 12.56pm.
Immediately
after the conclusion of his cross-examination, the transcript records as
follows, commencing with the primary judge addressing
the appellant, prior to
excluding him from the Court. Given what transpired over the course of the
remainder of the day, it is necessary
to cite from the transcript at greater
length than would otherwise be desirable.
HER HONOUR: Take a seat. You are released from the witness box.
<THE WITNESS WITHDREW [12.56 pm]
HER HONOUR: Practitioners, can I speak to you in the absence of the parties
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes. Yes, your Honour. Yes.
HER HONOUR: I am going to ask – well, not only will I ask the parties to
take a seat outside, but we – after I speak
to the practitioners, we will
– we will be breaking for an hour for lunch.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Okay.
HER HONOUR: So - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I will just have my solicitor take - - -
HER HONOUR: Yes. I have no difficulty with that.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: - - - my client out
HER HONOUR: Sir, if you could take – you are now released. If you could
come back at 2, please.
MR [RAMIRUS]: Can I just ask a question?
HER HONOUR: Yes.
MR [RAMIRUS]: Is there a chance to have a shorter lunch if they are worried
HER HONOUR: Sir, I have been sitting since 9 o’clock. I have three staff
who are working hard. They were entitled to an hour
lunch - - -
MR [RAMIRUS]: Yes. I am sorry about that.
HER HONOUR: - - - and they will be getting an hour lunch.
MR [RAMIRUS]: Yes. Okay. No problems.
HER HONOUR: Go outside, please, sir. We will see you at 2.
MR [RAMIRUS]: Thank you, your Honour. Do I take all my stuff, or can I - - -
HER HONOUR: No, sir. The courtroom will be locked.
MR [RAMIRUS]: Locked?
HER HONOUR: Yes.
MR [RAMIRUS]: I will take it then.
HER HONOUR: Sorry? You are going to take it? Why? The courtroom is going to be
MR [RAMIRUS]: Yes, but if I want to do some study outside or - - -
HER HONOUR: Well, there won’t be – well, I see. If you wish to take
some stuff to read over the lunch hour, you can do
MR [RAMIRUS]: Okay. Thank you, your Honour.
HER HONOUR: But otherwise, the courtroom will be locked in that hour. All right.
A couple of things arise. Firstly, the matter is
not going to be completed
today, is it? Secondly, and I know neither of you are going to want to hear
this, but I have got concerns
that I do not have a psychiatric assessment.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: I am picking up clear signs of what I consider to be narcissistic
issues, as well as personality disorders, and we have
a psychologist where, upon
reading both reports, really does not go into anything in respect to personality
disorders, apart from,
I think, conducting one test, and correct me if I am
wrong, but I do not have – I do not have extensive testing of this man.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: And conversely, your
questions of the mother about her anxiety, and fearfulness,
and that sort of
thing, that would be assistance too. It is something that the independent
children’s lawyer had approached
the parties on more than one occasion. It
has been raised, but there was no consent given by the parties.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: The father wouldn’t do it.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Well, I don’t know
who – I don’t know who I am pointing
the finger at, but it
wasn’t organised.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: That is right.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: But I think we think it
is – we think it is imperative.
HER HONOUR: But there are – there are some serious red flags that cause me
concern - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I am - - -
HER HONOUR: - - - in regard to the father’s behaviours. Yes. Sorry,
[Counsel for the Wife].
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes. I am instructed that it was requested of him, and
he said he wouldn’t do it, and [Independent
Children’s Lawyer] can
correct that if I am wrong about that, that is what I am told by my instructor,
and it hasn’t
been obviously recommended by either of the report writers.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: I am instructed this,
that his lawyers – so it went through his lawyers,
and the lawyers came
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: And there is the issue of cost as well.
HER HONOUR: Well, that could be funded by Legal Aid.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Yes. We could have that
HER HONOUR: But let us think this through in a logical sequence though, because
if I ask the question to the father, and he refuses,
we can’t take it any
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: And he might, given his
presentation.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: But if – your Honour, can I - - -
HER HONOUR: Yes, [Counsel for the Wife]. Please talk.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: We - - -
HER HONOUR: I will just dwell in this space otherwise.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Sorry?
HER HONOUR: Please talk.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Where is it going to get us?
HER HONOUR: Well, that is what I’m saying.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Where is a psychiatric assessment going to affect, in my
submission, the outcome of the case, where you have
clearly seen evidence for
two days, you are not a psychiatrist, I am not a psychiatrist, my client is not
a psychiatrist, but I will
– I will be saying whether it is because he has
got a psychiatric issue, or because he is a bad person, it won’t make
difference to the ultimate outcome because you have seen it yourself. I am sorry
to say this in the absence of the parties, your
Honour, but you have asked
– but that is what I will ultimately say. It doesn’t matter - -
HER HONOUR: Okay.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: - - - the psychiatric assessment.
HER HONOUR: Does this matter?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Okay.
HER HONOUR: Would it be of any assistance if a copy of the transcript was
provided to both family report writers?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I think - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I think that might be.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: And I think the matter of
this psych assessment, depending on what he wants
to do, but it is dotting the
I’s and crossing the T’s on a case where he is staring down a no
time order, or the children
are. I mean, it is – and he is self-acting.
That is why I think it is imperative, and I think the mother should be assessed
as well. But I definitely think the transcript is a good idea. Absolutely. That
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Why would – sorry. Why would my client need to be
assessed? I mean, you see - - -
HER HONOUR: Can I just make a comment about your client - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: - - - and whether this relates to an assessment or not?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: I am concerned that the mother may not realise the significant
impact that this relationship has had on her and her ability
to parent, because
she was very stoic, and she should be given credit for her bravery in the
witness box, where she said, “Well,
no. It is not impacting my
parenting”, but all the non-verbals from her indicate that this is a woman
who has been severely
impacted upon by her circumstances in dealing with this
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: It is one of the reasons why she seeks an order for no
time. Again, I don’t - - -
HER HONOUR: Exactly.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Again, she is just – again, this will be my
submission, she has just got on with it - - -
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: - - - as best she can.
HER HONOUR: But I – but what I – I am not saying that I support the
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: But I can understand why. But I agree with you both. I agree with
the situation, in that getting a psychiatric assessment
of the father or
psychological assessment of the mother is going to just drag this matter out
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: And I have had many psychiatric assessments come in where they flag
something, but then it is just something that is
flagged, and then I have to
work out where I am going to from there. I am concerned that the family report
writers, whilst they have
touched on the father’s behaviour, may not be
fully aware of the extent of the mindset that he has. There were comments made
during his evidence which demonstrate a very fixed mindset about how the world
operates, and how people interact, and how he is of
the view that his
interactions in certain ways is totally acceptable, and I do not know if that,
with no criticism of the family
report writers, has actually hit home with
Having said that though, and I just want to throw these things at you, so you
can think about it over lunchtime, I have no difficulty
in ordering the
transcript. I have no difficulty in providing the transcript to the family
report writers. I am also aware that [Family
Report Writer] is incredibly
expensive, and I do not know where that’s going to blow those costs out. I
am also aware that
you are both very good at cross-examination of the family
report writers, and perhaps if the concerns are articulated in such a way,
that might elicit some sort of response. I do not think that can be done in the
absence of you having the full benefit of the
transcript though - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: I agree.
HER HONOUR: - - - because this is just so intense and complicated and diverse in
the difficulties he has had with his interactions.
So these are the three
options that I want you to consider over lunch: is there any benefit to getting
psychological or psychiatric
assessment of the parties, and so that is the first
thing, and I have concerns about the time delay; the second thing is, is there
going to be a benefit to a transcript being provided to the family report
writers, given the costs it is going to incur, and I take
it – is it the
mother that has been bearing the costs, or both parties?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I think they both - - -
HER HONOUR: Right.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I think they both have.
HER HONOUR: Yes. The cost to [Family Report Writer].
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: [Family Report Writer].
HER HONOUR: [Family Report Writer]. Sorry. [Family Report Writer]. That is the
second option. The third option is this. I order the
transcript, even though I
am forbidden, I do not care, I will provide you copies of the transcripts, and
we work out a time plan
where you can make some inquiries as to when [Family
Report Writer] – and you have got to consider whether or not that
should also be given to [Mr B], even though he is not an expert, and
I will be guided by you. I have – I have got a big question
that. But the family report writers’ availability, because what I will do,
even though I said to my associate under
no circumstances, I have got some days
coming up in November that are free, and I will give you the range of those
days, because
if you could – because if you take option three, I can order
a very quick turnaround on the transcript, give it to you, and
that is going to
give you time to prepare your questioning of the family report writers.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: It will also give, just for the record - - -
HER HONOUR: Father time.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: - - - the father the time.
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: I think that is
important, too.
HER HONOUR: Yes, and I will tell the father he can – he can file. What
will I do? Even though I have released him from the
witness box, I will allow
the time for the father to put together his own tender bundle of additional
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Sorry. So sorry to groan.
HER HONOUR: Yes. Can you groan about something else, please? So what do you
think I should do with the father?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I don’t know. I will have a – I will have a
HER HONOUR: Have a think about that, as well.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I will have a think about that, your Honour, because
– yes. Can I ask - - -
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: - - - another question?
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Depending upon what date you give us - - -
HER HONOUR: Which I will no doubt give you shortly.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Okay.
HER HONOUR: And hold on, my associate is on it. I suspect option three is the
most practical of the options.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: And it is the most time effective of the options. Just – but I
– but I wanted to give you all a chance to
think about the ups and downs
of each. These are the dates, practitioners. So if you can put your head about
when you are going to
be available during these dates, so anywhere between 18
and 22 November and 25 and 26 November, and also turn your mind as to whether
one day is going to be enough, given that we have got three witnesses, and I
know we are doing written submissions, but we have got
three witnesses, where I
imagine there will be extensive cross-examination of the family report writers,
or whether it needs two
days, and turn your mind to what you think I need to do
to provide more procedural fairness to the father. Having said that though,
father has incredible recall on things that he thinks are important. In fact, he
was quoting, not only orders and notations,
but at one point I think he was
quoting parts of affidavits as well. So - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Can I ask you a question?
HER HONOUR: - - - I will leave that with you.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Can I ask you a question?
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Would you be prepared this afternoon to entertain an
interim application to suspend the operation of the
current orders pending the
matter coming back?
HER HONOUR: Would that be supported by the ICL?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I suppose they would have to - - -
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: - - - think about it, because I have only just raised
HER HONOUR: Yes. If – I will say it generally as this: if there is an
application made by you, [Counsel for the Wife] - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: - - - from the mother, and if it is supported by the ICL, then I
would have to give serious consideration to that application.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: All right. Thank you. Your Honour, can we – do you
mind if we have till 1.15?
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: 2.15.
HER HONOUR: I would love it if we had until 1.15.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: 2.15. Sorry. 2.15.
HER HONOUR: 2.15.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Your Honour, I hardly
ever do this. We are up to day 5 of a – trying
to get a consent order in
Beenleigh for a child protection matter. [Ms D] has briefed me, and she will be
on the line. It is listed
for 2. I was hoping just for maybe 20 minutes, if it
hasn’t finalised, I will disengage with Beenleigh - - -
HER HONOUR: Well, you know what? As we are not going to get much further today,
I take it [Mr B] is not available?
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: No.
HER HONOUR: And [Mr B], I need to hear from him before we put anything to the
family report writer.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes. I agree.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Absolutely.
HER HONOUR: So why don’t we stand down until 2.30?
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Thank you, your Honour. I
appreciate that.
HER HONOUR: And if any of you see the father in the precinct, could you please
just inform him that we will be standing down to 2.30?
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: Now, at 2.30, I am going to get you all in, explain to the father
that I have spoken to you procedurally about how we
can move this matter along,
and then I will hear from you as to the decision you have made as to a
suggestion as to how we can move
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Thank you so much.
HER HONOUR: Okay.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Thank you, your Honour. Your Honour, I can discuss this
with my client, can’t I?
HER HONOUR: Your client is not in the witness box.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: No.
HER HONOUR: Of course you can.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: No. No. Yes. Just because the - - -
HER HONOUR: Yes. Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: - - - parties were out of the room.
HER HONOUR: Of course you can.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: And I will be open with the father, too.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes. Yes. Yes.
HER HONOUR: But I needed to have an open conversation - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: With the practitioners. Yes. I understand.
HER HONOUR: - - - to practitioners. But, no. No. I will be explaining to the
father why we had the adjournment - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: - - - and what the issues are, and about [Mr B], and the – and
the evidence, and so forth.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: All right. Thank you, your Honour.
HER HONOUR: The other – the other thing is, though, if I am releasing the
transcript to both of you, I will have to release
it to the father as well.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I agree with that.
HER HONOUR: Like, I have no choice in that matter, and all I can do is just
remind him of the
section 121
restrictions in regard to that. Okay.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Thank you, your Honour.
ADJOURNED [1.12 pm]
(Consolidated transcript, 30 October 2024, p.223 line 24–p.232 line 42)
the hearing resumed at 2.54pm, the transcript records as follows:
RESUMED [2.54 pm]
HER HONOUR: Mr [Ramirus], I just want to explain why I asked to speak to the
practitioners just before lunch. This matter is not
going to be finished today.
[Mr B] is not available, and there is no possible way that we could finish, even
if he had been available
after lunch, that we could have finished three expert
witnesses in such a short period of time. So I wanted to give a couple of
available to the practitioners of where we go to from here, and I am
going to ask for their input as to how we now proceed. So I
will do that
firstly, and then I will – any issues raised by them, I will then bring
– come back to you and explain them,
just in case you don’t
understand.
MR [RAMIRUS]: Thank you, your Honour.
HER HONOUR: All right. Where are we going to from here? Who would like to speak
to me? [Counsel for the Wife].
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: We understand from your associate that there is only
certain dates that are available.
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: We elect the first available of those, being the
HER HONOUR: And that will be for two days?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I have spoken to my instructor about that. We think it
could be one day. I must say, I am worried that it
won’t finish in a
HER HONOUR: Well, when we have – and I will be speaking to the father in a
minute as to whether he can – whether he will
continue to be
self-represented or whether he intends to get legal representation, but there
will be three lots of cross, I imagine,
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: - - - each of the witnesses. So I just wonder whether or not that
can be contained to one day.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Maybe we can – I can just come back to that
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: That your Honour order transcript.
HER HONOUR: I will order the transcript. Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: That have been provided to all the parties, including to
the father.
HER HONOUR: Yes. I will be putting a restriction, though, on how the father can
access the transcript - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: That he - - -
HER HONOUR: - - - and that can be done through the subpoena section, and I will
explain that to the father in a minute.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: All right, and that he can re-examine himself on the
transcript - - -
HER HONOUR: Yes. Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: - - - because he was cross-examined for over two days,
and once he actually has the transcript, he will remember
those questions he was
asked - - -
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: - - - and then he will be able to, in effect, re-examine
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I submit that the transcript should be provided to all
three of the experts, but with a direction that they
are at liberty to read the
transcript should they so choose. But that is simply from the point of view of
costings. If [Family Report
Writer], [Mr B] and [Ms C] wish to read the
transcript beforehand, so be it. If they don’t, they are not required to,
will then have it for the purposes of cross-examination.
HER HONOUR: And so the three experts you referred to were - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: [Mr B].
HER HONOUR: Yes. So he is – so he is to be included?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes. I think he should be.
HER HONOUR: [Ms C] and - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: [Family Report Writer].
HER HONOUR: [Family Report Writer]. Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: You raised the issue of the benefit of a psychiatric or
psychological assessment.
HER HONOUR: Of the parties. Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I submit that it is unnecessary. You also raised the
issue of whether the father should be able to prepare
a tender bundle.
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Again, I submit that he shouldn’t. His evidence is
essentially closed.
HER HONOUR: It is.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: And – but he should be allowed to re-examine
HER HONOUR: I agree.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I then have an application in relation to time, but I
will perhaps just not say anything about that now.
HER HONOUR: At this point.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: They are – they are the procedural points.
HER HONOUR: Yes. [COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER].
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Just taking up that list
from [Counsel for the Wife], I wouldn’t say
a psychiatric assessment is
unnecessary, but I understand the costs, the timing and the like. I certainly
think it would be very
father’s position is at this point in time in relation to that. The
best option of course is for the transcript to go to those experts. I do not
quibble at all with [Counsel for the Wife]’s
submission that they
shouldn’t be forced to read it because of the cost. It is certainly
something no doubt under cross-examination
they will be taken to the relevant
passages for the purposes of our - - -
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: So that would be fine
with us to keep the cost down. Two days, yes, I think
it will take two days.
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: I don’t know
– well, [Counsel for the Wife] has foreshadowed what
his time application
will be on an interim basis. To me - - -
HER HONOUR: Yes. Well, we will consider that after I’ve procedurally dealt
with these issues.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: That’s correct. So
if we go down that track – and I will keep
my powder dry in relation to
that. If we do go down that track, I would like to be heard in relation to the
oncoming dates on the
18th as well. So, I’m not available that week, and
the last barrister – I know there’s a million in town, and you
get rid of matters very easily. It’s the Toowoomba trial week, and I think
at last count I’m in four trials that
week in a rolling list. But I
obviously don’t want to prejudice this matter, but - - -
HER HONOUR: But I think it’s important, [Counsel for the Independent
Children’s Lawyer], with your knowledge that you
need to continue.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: But that – in terms
of our interim position, if we have one, I might
make submissions that may
affect the timing of that anyway. We haven’t heard back from [Mr B],
because he has got clients all
afternoon and we don’t know his
availability. That’s the other difficulty.
HER HONOUR: Okay. Can I ask this of you, practitioners? I mean, I’m
incredibly busy in November, but are there dates where
you both have capacity to
be available?
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Monday, your Honour?
HER HONOUR: Sorry?
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Monday?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Monday.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Don’t look shocked,
your Honour. This Monday.
HER HONOUR: Well, that – well, that’s impractical because it’s
not going to give time for you. I mean, I can order
the transcript overnight,
but I can’t be guaranteed that I will get it tomorrow, it might be Friday.
It means you will have
no weekend, and it also means that - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: .....
HER HONOUR: - - - the family report writers wouldn’t have a weekend
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: I understand [Family
Report Writer] is available on Monday by telephone and
so is [Ms C], but we
haven’t heard from [Mr B].
HER HONOUR: I’ve got a four day matter starting Monday.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: I thought it was
optimistic, so to speak.
HER HONOUR: Are there any other two days that - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: I will confer with
[Counsel for the Wife] – in November?
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: I will confer with
[Counsel for the Wife].
HER HONOUR: All right. Mr [Ramirus], I understand that previously there have
been requests for you to undergo a psychiatric assessment,
which has been
refused by you. Is that correct?
MR [RAMIRUS]: Definitely not.
HER HONOUR: No?
MR [RAMIRUS]: I think the last time, correct me if I’m wrong, [Ms E], but
I think [Ms E] mentioned in an email letter –
and my response was I would
be happy to go anywhere in Australia to see the top experts and put this to bed.
And if I’m prepared
to do that, I would like both of us to do it,
HER HONOUR: All right. So you would do it if it was conditional from the mother
also doing it?
MR [RAMIRUS]: Look, I think it’s beneficial for both - - -
HER HONOUR: No, no.
MR [RAMIRUS]: - - - not conditional.
HER HONOUR: Just answer my question, sir.
MR [RAMIRUS]: Well, I don’t want to make conditional things. I just think,
the way I read it, I think it can help. And I think
– I would hope the
mother can be proactive enough that she can say, “Okay, let’s do
this for the kids.”
HER HONOUR: Okay. Are you prepared to pay for psychiatric assessment?
MR [RAMIRUS]: Both of ours, you mean?
HER HONOUR: Are you prepared to pay for your psychiatric assessment?
MR [RAMIRUS]: What are they worth, do you mind me asking?
HER HONOUR: I don’t know.
MR [RAMIRUS]: Do you know what they’re worth? What’s a psych
assessment worth?
HER HONOUR: Probably 10.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: $6,000 or $7,000, $10,000.
HER HONOUR: $10,000.
MR [RAMIRUS]: Look, if it’s in the best interest of the kids, I will do
HER HONOUR: All right.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Would you pay for the
MR [RAMIRUS]: I think the mother’s going to be well looked after now, but
I could. I’m happy to do what’s in the
best interests of the kids.
I’m already struggling financially, but we will do it.
HER HONOUR: I don’t think you’re struggling financially, sir. I
signed off on your property orders yesterday. There’s
a property pool that
is very big, and you’re part of the property pool. I can’t see how
you’re going to - - -
MR [RAMIRUS]: It doesn’t mean I’m cash rich.
HER HONOUR: - - - financially struggle.
MR [RAMIRUS]: I’m not cash rich, your Honour.
HER HONOUR: See, the difficulty I have with the psych assessment is that it will
take time, even if it is privately funded, and it
is going to delay this matter
significantly. And I am concerned that it may not be of assistance to me, and
that that delay is going
to be detrimental to all concerned, especially the
children. Do you have a comment about that?
MR [RAMIRUS]: I believe we can make it work. Like I think you mentioned before
– and this is just an idea, you mentioned September.
I said back at the
compliance and readiness hearing that, in my view, for the kids to get the best
interest, they need time, in my
view, with both parents of some amount of time.
What that is, is up to the court, obviously, but I just don’t believe it
be a fair trial if the kids haven’t had an opportunity to spend a
reasonable amount of time with either parent, given - - -
HER HONOUR: Well, they have spent time with you, sir.
MR [RAMIRUS]: We haven’t had any overnights, we don’t have any
dinners because we don’t operate like a functional
family. Most functional
families have a breakfast, they wake up together, they have a dinner, they
shower, they go to sleep. We haven’t
done any of that, your Honour,
because nine till four, you know, unless I try and take them home for a shower
at 10 o’clock
in the morning, I just don’t see the logic in that.
But I don’t believe I’ve been able to act as a proper father
result of the times that are set at present, which is one of my concerns and why
I keep raising this later time, so we can actually
sit down and have Sunday
dinner, which we do, get the kids showered and to bed and asleep, and then [Ms
Hendrika] picks them up -
HER HONOUR: Who’s “we?”
MR [RAMIRUS]: - - - fast asleep.
HER HONOUR: Who’s “we?” Which “we do,” you
MR [RAMIRUS]: The what, sorry?
HER HONOUR: You said, “We can have a Sunday dinner, which we do,”
are you talking about – who, you and the children?
MR [RAMIRUS]: Me and the kids.
HER HONOUR: All right.
MR [RAMIRUS]: And it has worked beautifully when it is working; putting the kids
from bed into the mum’s car, she goes home,
they’re not screaming
and squabbling, she picks them up, puts them in the bed, and it’s a very
calm night, and we’ve
done that many, many, many times.
HER HONOUR: Are you intending to be legally represented when this matter comes
MR [RAMIRUS]: I will have to – at the moment, I don’t - - -
HER HONOUR: Because I won’t be making provision for you to be legally
represented again; you will have to pay for your own
representation.
MR [RAMIRUS]: Yes. Well, if I’ve got to pay for it, I’m confident
that I don’t have confidence in some of these
legal firms out there, so I
will probably do what I’ve done today, just - - -
HER HONOUR: All right.
MR [RAMIRUS]: - - - give it my best shot.
HER HONOUR: So you’re going to continue to act on your own behalf?
MR [RAMIRUS]: I think that’s the way I get my instructions across.
HER HONOUR: Okay. All right. I’m just going to stand now for two minutes,
because I would like that discussion to occur as
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: We’ve had – we’ve had it.
HER HONOUR: You have? What are the days?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: We’ve worked out – unfortunately, so my
learned friend has the Toowoomba trial week; I have the
Maroochydore trial week,
which is next week, but I have nothing, it looks like, on that Friday the 29th.
I don’t think you
could do that date. And the reason why I suggest later
in the week is because these rolling lists, you get four trials, two fall
one adjourns. Your Honour has, I’m sure, done rolling lists in other
registries. So by Friday, usually everything is
pretty - - -
HER HONOUR: Everything is gone.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Everything’s gone by Friday, so which is why I
thought the 29th might work, and it works for my learned
friend; I don’t
know if it works for your Honour’s diary. The other option was the 18th
and 19th, but my learned friend
has a ..... trial
HER HONOUR: So, when you say the 29th, that means that the following Monday
would also be a day that’s required?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes, look - - -
HER HONOUR: This is not going to be finished in one day.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Look, I’ve got a mediation on, but I can get rid
HER HONOUR: I’m just going to stand down and speak to Madam Associate
going to come in and
make some procedural directions.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Or if your Honour – I’m sorry to interrupt
you – or if your Honour would prefer to do it
HER HONOUR: On?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: 23.
HER HONOUR: 23. Are you available, [Counsel for the Independent Children’s
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: I’m trying not to
be difficult today, but no, what I might do is confer
with my learning friend
whilst you’re stood down. I’m not available on those days. I’m
HER HONOUR: Are you available on 29 and 1?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Or 29 and 2.
HER HONOUR: Is it 29 and 2?
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: 2 is the start of a - -
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: - - - independent
children’s lawyer -no, I’m not. And I - - -
HER HONOUR: Okay. Are you not available – okay.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: I’m sorry I’m
being difficult - - -
HER HONOUR: No, no.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: I’m not trying to
HER HONOUR: I’m going to stand down. Could you please go outside and work
out where you have two consecutive days?
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Okay. Thank you.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: That you are able to be available, or move your commitments to be
available for those two days.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Not Christmas Day and
Boxing Day.
HER HONOUR: No. Okay. I will just wait outside.
ADJOURNED [3.08 pm]
RESUMED [3.26 pm]
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Doing the best we can, 18 and 19 November – I will
have to get rid of something on the 19th, but that’s
fine. And [Counsel
for the Independent Children’s Lawyer] has two independent
children’s lawyers trials in Toowoomba.
We were wondering, with your
listing of it for the 18th and 19th, if you could – or your associate
– contact the chambers
somehow of [Judge F] for her trials to be later in
the week. It’s just from a practicality point.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: [Ms G] is going to be
with me tomorrow, and it’s with [Ms G]. I understand
from my discussions
with the associate, they are going – [Judge F] is away.
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: They are hoping to give
dates as opposed to it just being a rolling list.
HER HONOUR: Right.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: I also have intelligence
that there is a lengthy trial that is likely to run,
and it might get kiboshed,
all of us, in terms of all the other – the trials. So there is
uncertainty. I would typically get
rid of the trials, but because it’s a
trial week, it’s hard to get barristers to - - -
HER HONOUR: Of course. No, we will contact [Judge F’s] chambers and ask
that consideration be given to the listing of any matters
involving yourself
towards the end of the week, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Yes, and the other
complication is this, [Ms G] is in a child protection matter
without counsel
funding on the Thursday Friday, so I don’t know if that will impact her.
But she’s here tomorrow, and
I will be able to ask her. I’ve
accommodate
HER HONOUR: And look, it’s not uncommon for judges, where ICLs are caught
up, to still allow a trial to run, as long as the
ICL is contactable.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Yes, well – yes. It
changes, but yes.
HER HONOUR: I know it changes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: It is [Judge F].
HER HONOUR: Fair enough.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: I meant that in a
positive way.
HER HONOUR: Yes. Well, yes, I don’t think you’re going to have any
difficulties. But yes, we will do that. All right,
does anyone else want to say
anything more about the procedural matters before I make a decision about how we
proceed going forward?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: The earliest opportunity that this matter can come back
before the court, with no psychiatric or psychological
report, is the best
thing, in my submission, for my client, for the father and for the children. So
that’s why I’m pushing
so hard to just get this matter on –
and I know your Honour is as well – as quickly as we possibly can.
HER HONOUR: Can I ask whether there have been any inquiries as to whether the
witnesses that are outstanding are going to be available
on the 18th and
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: No, and [Mr H] is not
available this afternoon. Uncontactable.
HER HONOUR: What about [Family Report Writer] and [Ms C]?
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: We will make inquiries
HER HONOUR: Okay. I think before I do anything, before we commit to something
and then be told they’re not available, [Mr B],
worse comes to worse, a
subpoena can issue. He’s not an expert witness. He has provided
affidavits. If I need to put him forward
in such a manner, I’m able to do
so. But out of courtesy to the expert witnesses, we need to know about their
availability.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Yes. [Ms C] is free.
HER HONOUR: Excellent.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: [Independent
Children’s Lawyer] is stepping out to call [Family Report
HER HONOUR: Okay. Why don’t we just stand down for two minutes for that
call to take place. I will just wait out the back.
ADJOURNED [3.30 pm]
RESUMED [3.34 pm]
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: [Ms C] and [Family Report
Writer] are available. [Independent Children’s
Lawyer]’s office is
ringing [Mr H], but we don’t know. But I hear what your Honour said.
HER HONOUR: Yes. If he’s not available, then, we might have to take that
legal recourse - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Sure.
HER HONOUR: - - - because this matter needs to go ahead.
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Sure.
HER HONOUR: All right.
JUDGMENT DELIVERED
HER HONOUR: Between now and 18 November is only a matter of a few weeks. When
are you seeing the children next? When is it scheduled?
MR [RAMIRUS]: Not this weekend, the following weekend is my understanding.
HER HONOUR: And what date is that?
MR [RAMIRUS]: Which is the 10th. Well, we haven’t actually got anything
booked in at [Counselling Practice] because it’s
all pending this.
They’ve got it tentatively booked, as far as I’m aware.
HER HONOUR: Thank you. On the court’s own motion, I am going to direct
that the father’s time with the children for the
weekend of the – is
it the 10th and the 11th? Unfortunately, I don’t know where my - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Your Honour, it is the - - -
HER HONOUR: I don’t have a - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I’ve got it.
HER HONOUR: Good. Because I didn’t have one before me.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: It’s a Sunday. So it’s the 10th and the
HER HONOUR: All right.
JUDGMENT DELIVERED
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Will your Honour also make an order that restrains the
father from attending at soccer? You heard some evidence
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: - - - the fact that he was 20 metres away from my client
at soccer last night after the trial. There’s
no order for him to attend
extracurricular activities. My client has asked through correspondence in the
past, page 150 out of my
bundle, for him not to attend. So would you please make
an order on my client’s behalf that he not attend extracurricular
activities,
school or kindergarten, pending further order, including soccer? And
the second thing I just wish to ask is does your Honour intend
to also suspend
the FaceTime calls?
HER HONOUR: I don’t intend – firstly, I will do the last thing
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: All right.
HER HONOUR: I don’t intend to suspend the FaceTime, calls because
I’m aware that the mother is in the background - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: - - - and that those calls can be terminated should the conversation
sway anywhere into adult issues. As to the attendance
at soccer games, that
isn’t the subject of an order. And again, the father just fails to
understand the seriousness of the
DVO order and the fact that every time he
turns up to those games, it’s technically a breach. And the mother has
not, for whatever
reason – and I give credit to her – not every time
a breach has occurred, reported that breach. The father needs to understand
there are real reasons why orders are made and that there are consequences, even
though he hasn’t felt them as yet, when
orders are not complied with.
JUDGMENT DELIVERED
HER HONOUR: Do you understand, sir, the orders I’ve made?
MR [RAMIRUS]: I understand.
HER HONOUR: And do you understand the reasons why I’ve made these
MR [RAMIRUS]: I heard what you said.
HER HONOUR: I didn’t ask whether you’ve heard. I’ve asked
whether you’ve understood what I’ve said.
MR [RAMIRUS]: I understand.
HER HONOUR: Thank you.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Or school or kindergarten or extracurricular activities.
Will you add that to the order?
HER HONOUR: Is there a history, though, of the father attending at school?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: No, but in my submission - - -
HER HONOUR: I won’t, because I would hope that common sense for the father
will prevail. And if this is a testing period for
the father to restrain
himself, it would be a good idea to actually do so. Because if the matter was to
come back before me in the
court and I hear that the father has been driving
past the mother’s house, has turned up at the school, has turned up at the
shopping centre, knowing that the kids are there, then, I’m going to have
serious concerns about whether the father has understood
what I’ve said
today. And I will have serious concerns about whether the father is going to
follow court orders moving into
the future. Because that is a very serious
concern I have in this matter. So I would have thought for the father it would
be imperative
that he would understand, firstly, the orders I’ve made
today and the gist as to why I’ve made those orders, and not
only comply
with the orders of this court, but, as importantly, comply with the orders of
the domestic violence orders that have
been made. Is there anything further at
this stage?
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: No. Thank you, your
HER HONOUR: [Counsel for the Independent Children’s Lawyer]. Anything
further from you, sir?
MR [RAMIRUS]: No, your Honour.
HER HONOUR: All right. Thank you, then. We will see you here at 9 am on 18
November. And, [Counsel for the Independent Children’s
Lawyer], my
associate has already made some inquiries. And we will certainly communicate
back with you or with [Independent Children’s
Lawyer] once we’ve
heard from the chambers of Judge .....
[COUNSEL FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHILDREN’S LAWYER]: Thank you. I really
appreciate that.
HER HONOUR: Okay. Thank you, practitioners.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Thank you, your Honour.
MATTER ADJOURNED at 3.49 pm UNTIL MONDAY, 18 NOVEMBER 2024
(Consolidated transcript, 30 October 2024, p.232 line 45–p.246 line 36)
part-heard trial resumed on 18 November 2024. The appellant was then represented
by new counsel and solicitors. At the commencement
of the day, counsel for the
made, and then withdrew, an oral application for
recusal by the primary judge on several bases:
HER HONOUR: So I am not allowing an adjournment. Now, do you have re-examination
of the father?
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: No, your Honour. However, given the inability to
question – sorry – re-examine the mother and
the denial of an
adjournment, there is a further application, and I do this with the utmost
respect to - - -
HER HONOUR: Is this going to be a recusal application?
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: Yes, your Honour.
HER HONOUR: Goodness me. No. On what basis? That because I have not given him an
adjournment? Because I have not allowed him to -
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: No.
HER HONOUR: Well, tell me, then, what’s the basis of the – and is
this the first time you’ve heard of this?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: It is from my learned friend, but [Independent
Children’s Lawyer] did tell me mid-morning about it
– that it may be
bought – but my learned friend hasn’t told me. He told me there may
be an application.
HER HONOUR: You see, I - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: I am ready.
HER HONOUR: What? Ready to be heard on the recusal?
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: Let him make his application.
HER HONOUR: Can I just make the following comment to the court. It seems to be a
common practice that’s emerging, in my experience,
that where people
don’t get what they want, they think that’s a basis for recusal, and
it’s not. So I hope it’s
not going to be another one of those,
because I’ve dealt with one of those recently where I’ve had to make
some scathing
remarks with the way the matter was conducted. Just because
someone doesn’t get what they want is not the basis for recusal.
should I step away from this matter?
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: Ultimately, your Honour – I’m sure
you’re aware of the double-might test with regards
to recusal –
through reading the transcripts there are a few items which, when combined,
we’re of the view might reach
the level that that test is activated;
it’s all of them in conjunction and not a singular item on its own. The
first being
that Mr [Ramirus], whose lawyers withdrew at the commencement of the
trial, was then left in a situation where he wasn’t adequately
prepared to
continue, but your Honour’s direction for the matter to continue.
HER HONOUR: Right. So I did not allow him an adjournment.
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: Right. Yes. Next one.
(Consolidated transcript, 18 November 2024, p.491 line 20–p.492 line 24)
Relevantly,
the following exchange between the primary judge and counsel for appellant
ensued shortly thereafter:
HER HONOUR: Next one.
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: The next one was when your Honour – your Honour,
perhaps with this particular next one I might ask
the parties to step outside,
provided I’ve got no objections.
HER HONOUR: Why? They were there when I did it.
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: They weren’t.
HER HONOUR: They weren’t?
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: Okay.
[COUNSEL FOR THE WIFE]: So?
HER HONOUR: Yes. So what? Go ahead. I mean, you’re asking –
you’ve received instructions that I should recuse myself.
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: So in page 217 of the transcript your Honour expressed
concerns about the father having potential narcissistic
tendencies, as well as
personality disorders. I would submit that this is a view being formed, and your
Honour did make note that
this is something that has crossed your mind, even
without the support of - - -
HER HONOUR: I used the word “potential”, didn’t I?
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: Yes.
HER HONOUR: Yes. Thank you.
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]:
...having potential narcissistic tendencies –
HER HONOUR: And what was the other thing I said?
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]:
...as well as personality disorders.
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: But you recognised that no psych assessment focusing
on these particular issues had been completed - -
HER HONOUR: That’s right.
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: - - - for either party. Now, the other concern is that
at this point in time – this was where your
Honour was talking to the
legal practitioners in – my understanding from reading the transcript
– I am happy to be corrected
here – in procedural matters. As a
self-representative, technically, my client probably should have been present
while discussing
procedural matters.
HER HONOUR: Next.
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: As part of these discussions [Counsel for the Wife]
– and I am not suggesting he intended to mislead
the court in any capacity
here, but at page 217 of the transcript he states that he believed that the
father had been asked to do
a psych assessment to which the father had said no.
Your Honour, later, rightfully so, asked the father whether or not he had and
whether or would have been willing to attend a psych assessment; I believe this
is at page 228 of the transcript. He expressed if
it could help the children, he
would absolutely agree, and he also indicated that he would have been willing to
pay for it for both
the mother and the father.
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: Now, in page 219 of the transcript your Honour also
expressed that a psychiatric assessment for both parties
may flag issues that
result in making your Honour’s job more difficult and delaying
proceedings.
HER HONOUR: Yes.
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: If your Honour is of the view that it may make your
job more difficult or delay proceedings, it’s
our submission that there is
a perception there that, perhaps, what would be contained within the reports is
relevant to the point
where it made a determination harder.
HER HONOUR: Well, did your client go off and get a psych assessment - - -
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: No. But he - - -
HER HONOUR: - - - and present it to me? So he wasn’t proactive in getting
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: He was not proactive.
HER HONOUR: So his concerns couldn’t be that high, could they, if he
didn’t go and get a psych assessment.
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: When - - -
HER HONOUR: You see – I will let you continue. I agree with what [Counsel
for the Wife] has said. You now have the benefit,
at the court’s expense,
of a full transcript that you can pick apart to find little bits and pieces,
like a jigsaw, to try
and make a whole picture.
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: Yes, your Honour.
HER HONOUR: But I don’t see where the father has been proactive in doing
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: And I accept that he hasn’t been proactive - -
HER HONOUR: Excellent. All right. Next.
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: - - - in that capacity, at all. The one –
actually, your Honour, the one piece I would add to that,
however, is he
actually did go and see [Mr J] – and this is contained within the tender
bundle; I’m going off memory
here, so I can’t direct you to the
exact page – where it’s actually noted in [Mr J]’s records
that the father
had actually gone and asked him about a psych assessment, but
there’s no other comment other than that was an issue that the
HER HONOUR: And how long ago was that?
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: If your Honour would give me a moment, I will try and
find the exact – so I don’t want to mislead
the court in any way. I
am trying to – I think it’s page 259 of the tender bundle, your
HER HONOUR: Right. And when was that?
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: I’m sorry. No. That is the wrong one. Sorry.
HER HONOUR: I suppose what I’m asking was, did that occur prior to the
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: I believe it occurred in February, your Honour.
HER HONOUR: Right. Prior to the trial. Right. Your next issue?
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: Sorry, your Honour. I’ve just got to find my
place. The next issue is one that your Honour had already
commented on, which is
not seeking the adjournment application which was just made now.
(Consolidated transcript, 18 November 2024, p.492 line 42–p.495 line 37)
alluded to, neither this limb of the recusal application, nor any other, was
directed squarely at the fact that the primary
judge had engaged in
exchanges on 30 October 2024, between 12.56–1.12 pm, with the
legal representatives for the respondent and the Independent
Lawyer, from which appellant, who was self-represented at the time, was excluded
by her Honour. It was one thing
for her Honour also to exclude the respondent
from the Court; she was represented by counsel, who remained in Court. However,
the circumstances, it was entirely a different thing to exclude the
Ultimately,
there was the following exchange between the primary judge and counsel for the
HER HONOUR: It’s the timing of the recusal application that makes me,
first of all, question whether or not it is genuine in
it being sought. Would
you like me to stand down so that you can reaffirm your client’s
instructions as to whether he wishes
to proceed with the recusal application,
given the timing this application has been made?
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: I am happy to reaffirm those instructions, your
HER HONOUR: Thank you. Let’s stand down for two minutes. And, then, if he
continues, I will then hear from [Counsel for the
Wife]’s side.
(Consolidated transcript, 18 November 2024, p.499 lines 6–15)
the hearing resumed, some 15 minutes later, there was the following further
exchange between the primary judge and counsel for
the appellant:
HER HONOUR: Yes. Thank you.
[COUNSEL FOR THE FATHER]: Your Honour, after some in-depth discussions with my
client I am instructed to withdraw the application
seeking a recusal.
HER HONOUR: Thank you. All right.

PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS
Genesalio & Genesalio

Court summarised the principles of procedural fairness as follows:
The concept of procedural fairness is concerned only with the fairness of the
hearing; not the fairness of the outcome (
SZBEL v Minister for Immigration
& Multicultural Affairs
(2006) 228 CLR 152
at [25]). The rules
of natural justice, which do not have immutably fixed content, are applied
practically to ensure fairness (

Kanda v Government of Malaya
[1962] UKPC 2
[1962] AC 322
at 337–338, Lord
Denning, Lord Hodson and Lord Devlin said:
The rule against bias is one thing. The right to be heard is another. Those two
rules are the essential characteristics of what is
often called natural justice.
They are the twin pillars supporting it. The Romans put them in the two maxims:
Nemo judex in causa
sua: and Audi alteram partem. They have recently been put in
the two words, Impartiality and Fairness. But they are separate concepts
governed by separate considerations. ...
If the right to be heard is to be a real right which is worth anything, it must
carry with it a right in the accused man to know
the case which is made against
him. He must know what evidence has been given and what statements have been
made affecting him: and
then he must be given a fair opportunity to correct or
contradict them. This appears in all the cases from the celebrated judgment
Lord Loreburn L.C. in
Board of Education v. Rice
[1911] UKLawRpAC 18
[1911] A.C. 179
down to the decision of their Lordships' Board in
Ceylon University v.
[1960] UKPC 6
[1960] 1 W.L.R. 223].
It follows, of course, that the judge or
whoever has to adjudicate must not hear evidence or receive representations from
behind the back of the other. The court will not inquire whether the
evidence or representations did work to his prejudice, Sufficient
might do so. The court will not go into the likelihood of prejudice. The risk of
it is enough. No one who has lost a case
will believe he has been fairly treated
if the other side has had access to the judge without his knowing.
(As per the original)
audi alteram partem
rule, namely, the right to be heard and, conversely,
the right not to be not heard, is one of the principles of natural justice and
is at the bedrock of our legal system. Indeed, it long precedes our legal
system. It is said to be attributable to St Augustine
centuries CE) in his
XIV.2: see Mirko Bagaric,
Ross on Crime
(Thomson Reuters,
edition, 2022), at paragraph 1.7000. However, in fact, it
hearkens back to the Bible and thereafter Babylonian Talmud (circa
century). Referring to the biblical injunction to judges in
Deuteronomy 1:16 to “hear the causes between your brethren, and
judge”, the Babylonian Talmud in Tractate
7B explains:
“This is a warning to a court that it may not hear the statement of one
litigant before the other litigant comes,
and it is a warning to a litigant that
he may not explain his statement to the judge before the other litigant comes.
Read into the
phrase in the verse ... that it is also concerning the litigant.
Although he is not the judge, he is also required to assure that
the case is
conducted in the presence of both parties” (Koren Publishers, Jerusalem).
Further, the Babylonian Talmud in Tractate
31A explains:
“From where is it derived that a judge should not hear the statement of
one litigant before the other litigant
comes to court? It is derived as the
verse [in Exodus 23:7] states: ‘Distance yourself from a false
matter’” (Koren
Publishers, Jerusalem).
Notwithstanding
the distinction drawn between the rule against bias and the right to be heard,
they are both aspects of natural justice.
In some cases, they may overlap; in
other cases, they appear to be considered interchangeable. Nevertheless, the
distinction may
be important where, as in the present case, application for
recusal on the grounds of apprehended bias was made and then withdrawn.
Kioa v West
[1985] HCA 81
(1985) 159 CLR 550
at 582, Mason J said:
It is a fundamental rule of the common law doctrine of natural justice expressed
in traditional terms that, generally speaking, when
an order is to be made which
will deprive a person of some right or interest or the legitimate expectation of
a benefit, he is entitled
to know the case sought to be made against him and to
be given an opportunity of replying to it: ...

In one way or another the rules of natural justice are concerned with the
requirement that decisions affecting the rights of citizens
shall be reached
only after a fair hearing. That will occur if the tribunal observes the
rule audi alteram partem and its members
are not interested in the
subject matter of the hearing: nemo debet esse judex in propria sua

, in the course of parenting
proceedings, a report was prepared by a court counsellor which strongly favoured
the mother. The child
then lived with the father. The report stated that, if the
child remained living with him, her anxiety neurosis could be expected
deteriorate. An adjournment was discussed between counsel for the parties. The
counsellor protested to the mother about the adjournment,
discussed the matter
with the Director of Court Counselling and then, during the luncheon
adjournment, spoke in chambers to the judge
hearing the proceeding. Thereafter,
the judge called counsel for the parties into her chambers and a conversation,
substantially
between the judge and the counsellor, ensued. When the hearing
resumed that afternoon, counsel for the father asked the judge to
herself from hearing the matter further, but the judge refused to do so.

prohibiting the judge from further proceeding in the matter, Gibbs CJ said at
It is a fundamental principle that a judge must not hear evidence or receive
representations from one side behind the back of the
Government of Malaya
. McInerney J. stated the practice as it is generally
understood in the profession in
Reg. v. Magistrates' Court at Lilydale; Ex
parte Ciccone
as follows:
''The sound instinct of the legal profession - judges and practitioners alike -
has always been that, save in the most exceptional
cases, there should be no
communication or association between the judge and one of the parties (or the
legal advisers or witnesses
of such a party), otherwise than in the presence of
or with the previous knowledge and consent of the other party. Once the case
under way, or about to get under way, the judicial officer keeps aloof from the
parties (and from their legal advisers and witnesses)
and neither he nor they
should so act as to expose the judicial officer to a suspicion of having had
communications with one party
behind the back of or without the previous
knowledge and consent of the other party. For if something is done which affords
a reasonable
basis for such suspicion, confidence in the impartiality of the
judicial officer is undermined."
The principle, which forbids a judge to receive representations in private, is
not confined to representations made by a party or
the legal adviser or witness
of a party. It is equally true that a judge should not, in the absence of the
parties or their legal
representatives, allow any person to communicate to him
or her any views or opinions concerning a case which he or she is hearing,
a view to influencing the conduct of the case. Indeed, any interference with a
judge, by private communication or otherwise,
for the purpose of influencing his
or her decision in a case is a serious contempt of court: see
Halsbury's Laws
of England,
4th ed., vol. 9, par. 28 and cases there cited.
(Footnotes omitted)
Honour further said at 347:
[O]nce the Family Court is called on to perform its judicial functions, it must
perform them judicially. It is quite antipathetic
to and subversive of the
exercise of the judicial power that a judge should receive private
communications from any official, however
well informed and well intentioned,
even if the official is an officer of the court.
Honour concluded at 349–350:
In the present case it was wrong of the counsellor to attempt to influence the
judge and ill-advised for the judge to speak to the
counsellor in private.
Counsel for the prosecutor referred us to authorities which establish that a
judge should not sit to hear
a case if in all the circumstances the parties or
the public might entertain a reasonable apprehension that the judge might not
an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question
involved in it: see
Livesey v. N.S.
Bar Association
think that the present case is governed by an analogous principle, that justice
must not only be done but must manifestly
be seen to be done; when a judge has
received in private representations concerning a case, the court will not
inquire whether the
representations in fact worked to the prejudice of the party
against whose interest they were made – it is enough that they
Kanda v. Government of Malaya
Examples of a strict
application of the principle are provided by
R. v. Justices of Bodmin; Ex
parte McEwen
Garrihy v. Wyatt
. In the present case, the
counsellor had formed a view adverse to the husband. She had expressed that
view, not only in her report,
but also in the presence of counsel in the judge's
chambers. She had gone to see the judge because she believed that it would be
detrimental to the child to remain for long in the husband's custody. The
husband was entitled, not unreasonably, to fear that the
counsellor may have
made remarks adverse to him when she was alone with the judge and that the judge
might have been influenced by
them. Justice would not be manifestly seen to be
done if in those circumstances the judge decided the case. The judge should not
continue to hear the case and the order nisi for prohibition should be made
(Footnotes omitted)
J said at 350:
A central element in the system of justice administered by our courts is that it
should be fair and this means that it must be open,
impartial and even-handed.
It is for this reason that one of the cardinal principles of the law is that a
judge tries the case before
him on the evidence and arguments presented to him
in open court by the parties or their legal representatives and by reference to
those matters alone, unless Parliament otherwise provides. It would be
inconsistent with basic notions of fairness that a judge should
account, or even receive, secret or private representations on behalf of a party
or from a stranger with reference to a
case which he has to decide. This
principle immediately distinguishes the judicial branch from other branches of
government, except
in so far as they may be relevantly affected by the rules of
natural justice. In conformity with the principle, every private communication
to a judge made for the purpose of influencing his decision in a case is treated
as a contempt of court because it may affect the
course of justice:

per Lord Cottenham L.C. Indeed, it is regarded as a serious

Kanda v Government of Malaya
and that of McInerney J in
Magistrates’ Court at Lilydale; Ex parte Ciccone
[1973] VicRp 10
[1973] VR 122
said at 351:
As McInerney J. pointed out, the receipt by a judge of a private communication
seeking to influence the outcome of litigation before
him places the integrity
of the judicial process at risk. A failure to disclose that communication will
seriously compromise the
integrity of that process. On the other hand, although
the terms of a subsequent disclosure by the judge of the communication and
statement of its effect in some, perhaps many, situations will be sufficient to
dispel any reasonable apprehension that he might
be influenced improperly in
some way or other, subsequent disclosure will not always have this result. The
circumstances of each
case are all important. They will include the nature of
the communication, the situation in which it took place, its relationship
issues for determination and the nature of the disclosure made by the judge.
J continued at 355:
It follows that the approach made by Ms. Bernet, the court counsellor, to the
judge in this case and the conversation which then
took place between Ms. Bernet
and the judge in private chambers with respect to the proposed adjournment, in
the absence of the parties
and their legal representatives, was not authorized
by the Act or the Rules. It was a very serious departure from the cardinal
which governs the hearing and determination of cases in courts of
justice, though it is plain enough that the motive for the departure
was concern
on the part of Ms. Bernet for the future welfare of the child. The seriousness
of that departure was certainly alleviated
by the judge's prompt and proper
disclosure to counsel for the parties of the approach made by Ms. Bernet and of
the substance of
the discussion which occurred in private chambers.
J concluded at 356–357:
It is evident from what I have said that there is a firm basis for a reasonable
apprehension that the judge will not bring to bear
an impartial and unprejudiced
mind on the resolution of the custody issue. It is not to the point to say that
the prosecutor has
failed to establish the existence of any bias on the part of
the judge. The courts have always refused, for obvious reasons, to embark
an inquiry whether a judge will determine the issues impartially and with an
unprejudiced mind. It would be idle for this Court
to say that it is confident
that the judge will act impartially. We have to ask ourselves how the matter
would appear, viewed reasonably,
to the public and the parties. And when we ask
this question the answer that immediately presents itself is that the judge, who
all probability would be called upon to evaluate the correctness of the
opinion of the court counsellor and her credibility as a
witness, had the
unprecedented advantage of a private discussion with her on the very issue for
decision in the case, the counsellor
being a convinced, and perhaps convincing,
advocate of the wife's cause in the case. The fact that the counsellor is an
the court is a matter which enhances, rather than diminishes, cause
for concern. A fair-minded observer, as well as a concerned parent
party to the litigation would naturally and rationally conclude that the
counsellor's standing as an officer of the court
would ensure that her opinion
would carry weight with the judge. The subsequent discussion between the judge
and counsel in private
chambers would have done nothing to dispel that cause for
concern. The case is plainly one in which the principle that justice must
manifestly be seen to be done requires that the matter be heard by another
Goold v. Evans & Co
(Footnotes omitted)
J said at 368–369:
The counsellor, whose report was clearly of great importance and whose opinion
strongly favoured the wife's case, approached the
judge and spoke to her
privately about the case. In
In re Dyce Sombre
Lord Cottenham L.C. said:
“Every private communication to a Judge, for the purpose of influencing
his decision upon a matter publicly before him, always
is, and ought to be,
reprobated; it is a course calculated, if tolerated, to divert the course of
justice, and is considered, and
ought more frequently than it is, to be treated
as, what it really is, a high contempt of Court.”
No doubt both Ms. Bernet and Mr. Goodsell were motivated by professional concern
for the welfare of the child, but that was the issue
being litigated between
husband and wife. It was the issue which the judge had to determine and, in the
absence of any statutory
provision authorizing the counsellor to approach the
judge, it was improper for her to raise privately with the judge any aspect
that issue.
(Footnotes omitted)
J further said at 369–370:
If a counsellor were given access to a judge to discuss privately a case pending
in the court, the parties could have no confidence
that justice would be done
according to the impartial view of the judge on the evidence adduced in the
proceedings. The parties to
litigation are entitled to be present during the
hearing of their case not merely because they have an interest in the
proceedings
but because confidence in the court could not be maintained if the
parties are left unaware or only partially aware of the matters
which affect the
Court’s judgment. The Act has curtailed public scrutiny of the
administration of justice in the Family Court,
but it does not countenance the
administration of justice in the absence of parties who may wish to be and are
able to be present.
It would require at least statutory authority to permit a
judge to discuss with a counsellor out of court any question of substance
relating to an issue in proceedings for custody pending before that judge. Nor
does the Act authorize a judge before whom proceedings
are pending for the
custody of a child of a marriage to discuss an issue in the proceedings with a
counsellor and the legal representatives
of the parties meeting in private. The
cannot be exercised
in the privacy of a judge's chambers. That is incompatible
with the intention of the Parliament. To leave the parties - typically
parties - to learn by report what has happened in their absence is to foster any
apprehension either party may have that
the proceedings may not be judicially

Litigants, whether the State, corporations, or natural persons are not the only
ones who have an interest in an impartial, and
an apparently impartial system of
justice. Indeed it is also the interest of the public at large in such a system
that dictates that
a trial must not only be impartially conducted but also must
be seen to be so. The whole rationale behind the apprehended bias rule
need for public confidence in the judicial system: it is of “fundamental
importance that justice should not only be
done, but should manifestly and
undoubtedly be seen to be done”. Or, as Deane J stated in
: “it is of fundamental importance that the parties to
litigation and the general public have full confidence in the integrity,
including the impartiality, of those entrusted with the administration of

fair trial but during it there was conduct by the
judge in relation even to
legal matters only, and in the absence of the jury, strongly suggesting
otherwise. If fair minded observers
unconnected with the litigation, and even
informed to the extent that the law presupposes, were nevertheless to be left
impression that the trial judge was apparently biased a new trial still
might have to be considered as a possibility. Justice must
be seen to be done:
otherwise justice will not in fact be done. As Lord Denning MR
“The reason is plain
enough. Justice must be rooted in confidence: and confidence is destroyed when
right-minded people go away

“This is why impartiality
and the appearance of it are the supreme judicial virtues. It is the verdict
that matters, and if
it is incorrupt, it is acceptable. To be incorrupt it must

the present case, when the hearing resumed at 2.54pm on 30 October 2024, this
time in the presence of the appellant, the primary
judge told him that she
wanted to explain why she had asked to speak to the legal practitioners for the
other parties. Her Honour
told him that the trial, which had been listed for
three days, would not be concluded that day, being the third day, and that she
had “wanted to give a couple of options available to the practitioners of
where we go to from here” and that she was
“going to ask for their
input as to how we now proceed” (consolidated transcript 30 October 2024,
p.233, lines 5–7).
it is manifest from the transcript of the preceding exchanges between the
primary judge and the legal practitioners for the
respondent and the Independent
Children’s Lawyer, in the absence of the self-represented appellant, that
her Honour had done
much more than that.
Honour had expressed “concerns” that she did not have a psychiatric
assessment of the appellant. Her Honour had told
the lawyers that she was
“picking up clear signs” of what she somehow considered to be
“narcissistic issues, as
well as personality disorders”,
notwithstanding that, at that stage, only the respondent and the appellant had
been cross-examined
and that the family reports did “not go into anything
in respect to personality disorders” (consolidated transcript 30
2024, p.225 lines 3–6). Her Honour had said that she considered there were
“some serious red flags ... in regard
to the [appellant’s]
behaviours” that caused her concern (consolidated transcript 30 October
2024, p.225 lines 23 and
28). Her Honour had invited counsel for the other
parties to “think through this [with her] in a logical sequence ...
if I ask the question to the [appellant], and he refuses, we can’t
take it any further”, the “question” being
whether he would
submit to a psychiatric assessment (consolidated transcript 30 October 2024,
p.225 lines 46–47). When asked,
in response, by counsel for the
respondent, “[w]here is it going to get us?” her Honour had
responded: “Well, that
is what I’m saying” (consolidated
transcript 30 October 2024, p.226 lines 16–18). Her Honour had expressed
that the respondent “may not realise the significant impact that
this relationship has had on her and her ability to parent,
because she was very
stoic, and she should be given credit for her bravery in the witness box, ...
but all the non-verbals from her
indicate that this is a woman who has been
severely impacted upon by her circumstances in dealing with this man”
(consolidated
transcript 30 October 2024, p.227 lines 16–21). Her Honour
had agreed with counsel for the other parties that “getting
a psychiatric
assessment of the [appellant] or psychological assessment of the [respondent] is
going to just drag this matter out
further” (consolidated transcript 30
October 2024, p.226 lines 40–41). Her Honour had expressed concern to
counsel that
“the family report writers, whilst they have touched on the
[appellant’s] behaviour, may not be fully aware of the extent
mindset that he has” (consolidated transcript 30 October 2024, p.227 line
47–p.228 line 2). Her Honour had opined
that “[t]here were comments
made during [the appellant’s] evidence which demonstrate[d] a very fixed
mindset about how
the world operates, and how people interact, and how he is of
the view that his interactions in certain ways is totally acceptable”,
said that she did not know if that had “actually hit home” with the
family report writers (albeit in the absence
of cross-examination at that point
in time) (consolidated transcript 30 October 2024, p.228 lines 2–6). Her
Honour had opined
that it was “just so intense and complicated and diverse
in the difficulties [the appellant] has had with his interactions”
(consolidated transcript 30 October 2024, p.228 lines 19–20). Her Honour
had canvassed with counsel the options she wished
them to consider over the
luncheon adjournment, including whether there was any benefit in obtaining
psychological or psychiatric
assessment of the parties, given her
“concerns about the time delay” (consolidated transcript 30 October
2024, p.228
line 23). Her Honour had asked counsel: “What will I
do?” (consolidated transcript 30 October 2024, p.229 line 14) and
“So what do you think I should do with the [appellant]?”
(consolidated transcript 30 October 2024, p.229 lines 20–21).
had told the legal representatives that she “wanted to give you all a
chance to think about the ups and downs of
each” of the options
(consolidated transcript 30 October 2024, p.230 line 2), the reference to
“you all” manifestly being to the exclusion
of the appellant, who
was then unaware of what had been discussed and who only became aware thereof at
some stage after that day,
when the transcript was subsequently made available
to him and/or his new lawyers.
during this exchange, still in the absence of the self-represented appellant,
counsel for the respondent had asked her Honour
whether she would be prepared to
entertain an interim application that afternoon to suspend the operation of
interim orders for time
to be spent between the children and the appellant,
pending the resumption of the trial in the latter half of the following month.
Her Honour had responded that, if there were such an application and it were
supported by the Independent Children’s Lawyer,
then she “would have
to give serious consideration to that application”.
her Honour had said to counsel that, after the luncheon adjournment:
“I am going to get you all in, explain to the [appellant] that I have
spoken to you
procedurally
then I will hear from you as to the decision you have made as to a suggestion as
how we can move it along”.
(Consolidated transcript 30 October 2024, p.231 lines 32–35)
(Emphasis added)
as is manifest, her Honour did much more than merely speak to counsel about how
the matter could be progressed procedurally.
insofar as the primary judge had said to counsel that, whilst she would be
“open” with the appellant (Consolidated
transcript 30 October 2024,
p.232 line 13), and would explain to him why “we had the
adjournment” (Consolidated transcript
30 October 2024, p.232 lines
21–22), but that she needed to have an “open conversation”
with them (Consolidated
transcript 30 October 2024, p.232 line 17), if that had
indeed been the case, it is difficult to understand why her Honour could
have had that conversation in the presence of the appellant, all the more so in
the critical circumstances where he did not have
legal representation privy to
those exchanges.
is apparent from the transcript, that afternoon, the primary judge heard
submissions in relation to the benefit or otherwise of
a psychiatric or
psychological assessment of the parties. Counsel for the respondent submitted
that it was unnecessary. Counsel for
the Independent Children’s Lawyer
submitted that, notwithstanding “the costs, the timing and the like ... it
very helpful” (Consolidated transcript 30 October 2024, p.235
lines 25–26). The appellant said that, if it were considered
to be in the
best interests of the children, he would undergo a psychiatric assessment,
irrespective of whether the respondent was
required to do likewise, although he
considered that he was “already struggling financially”
(Consolidated transcript
30 October 2024, p.238 lines 13–14).
Notwithstanding what she was told by counsel for the Independent
Children’s Lawyer
and by the appellant, her Honour responded that she had
“difficulty ... with the psych [sic] assessment” because it would
take time, it would delay the matter significantly, it might not be of
assistance to her and the delay would be detrimental to all
especially the children (Consolidated transcript 30 October 2024, p.238 lines
that afternoon, without the foreshadowed application for a suspension of the
children’s time with the appellant, pending
the resumption of the
part-heard trial, having actually been made, or having heard any substantive
submissions in relation thereto,
beyond what the primary judge earlier discussed
with counsel for the respondent and the Independent Children’s Lawyer, in
absence of the self-represented appellant, her Honour nevertheless ordered,
of her own motion, that such time be suspended and that
he be restrained from
attending their soccer games until further order.
her reasons for judgment delivered
that day, which are not the
subject of appeal, her Honour said that she had considered whether psychiatric
or psychological assessments
would assist (at [3]). Her Honour said:
relation to the mother. There is no application before the Court that the
children should be removed from the mother or that the
mother’s time be
restricted in any way and the father in his own words has commented that the
mother is a good mother and is
doing a good job raising the children
psychiatric or psychological assessment of the mother where there is no other
evidence before the Court that there are any mental
health issues for the
mother. I find would not be useful on any level given the issues that need to be
considered by this Court.
respect to the father. We have albeit untested, two affidavits by his treating
psychologist, and the treating psychologist will
be available to give evidence
and be able to be cross examined. The father has been under the care albeit it
off and on again for
some time before that treating psychologist.
has never been a recommendation made in either family report or by the treating
psychologist that the father needs a psychiatrist
and I, having thought about
the matter in great detail, do not believe a psychiatric assessment of the
father is going to assist
this matter in the decision that has to be made.
if a diagnosis was made. Even if elements of treatment were made. It still is up
to the Court as to what is in the best interests
of the children moving
(As per the original)
Subsequently,
in her reasons the subject of this appeal, the primary judge observed at [64]
that the Court did “not have the
benefit of a psychiatric
assessment” of the appellant and said at [65]:
first, the father refused to an assessment and although the father had an
opportunity later to obtain and provide such an assessment,
the father chose not
will be apparent from the foregoing, that was not the case. I observe,
parenthetically, that Ground 5 of the amended Notice of
Appeal contends, it
appears correctly, that the primary judge erred in fact in her finding at [65];
however, for the reasons herein,
it is unnecessary to consider the grounds of
appeal beyond Ground 1.
relation to the children spending time with the father, her Honour, in her
reasons for judgment delivered on 30 October 2024 said:
going to suspend the father’s time with the children on 10 and 17 of
November 2024.
reasons for the suspension are this, and they are the only two days that I have
at this point suspended. The father has blatantly
disregarded the provisions of
the domestic violence order in that the father has directly contacted the mother
in respect to completing
a personality test.
importantly, and more disturbingly he thought it was appropriate that within the
precinct of the court, he talked to the mother
directly at a time when
everyone’s emotions are high, where there are issues that need to be
canvassed in the Court and where
the father has held on to a notion totally
misguided that somehow this Court has made an order that the domestic violence
not be followed.
is not the case. Whatever has been done by Judicial Registrars or Registrars
previously has never been in an order, it’s
been in a notation. And the
context of that has been taken completely out of what it was designed. The
father needs to understand
that he has to take the domestic violence orders
is a history in this matter where the father has not complied with the orders or
has misinterpreted what the orders have meant.
That is my first concern as to
why I am suspending time.
second reason why I am suspending time is because I have concerns that the
father will raise with the children issues that have
arisen in this part-heard
trial. Whether that is directly or indirectly. Whether that is brought up by the
father or in answer to
any of the questions asked by the children. I cannot
afford for the children to be brought any further into the adult issues during
the course of this trial.
third reason why I am directing suspension of time, is the mother needs
breathing space, the children need breathing space, and
the father needs to read
that transcript and think about the position that he holds in respect to his
very fixed views about how
to deal with conflict and how to deal with people and
perhaps take the opportunity to speak to [Mr J] who will have a copy of the
transcript, about the approach he might wish to take moving forward in how he
has interactions with people.
father did demonstrate during the course of his cross-examination levels of
aggravation and rudeness, if I could put it that way
to the Court and appeared
even having been asked several times to directly answer questions, having been
asked several times not
to do certain things, failed to take direction as to
what is appropriate behaviour.
always have grave concerns that if people can’t even behave in a court
system and a court room where they are under very strict
rules as to how to
behave, then how their behaviour must be carried out in private, when it’s
being completely unfettered and
is for those reasons that I am suspending time with the children.
do not want the father to think for a moment that I have pre-judged this matter.
I have not. But what everyone needs to understand
is that I am here to make
decisions in the best interests of the children.
am of the view that it is in the best interests of the children between now and
when the trial resumes in a couple of weeks’
time that they not be
confronted by any unnecessary conversations about adult issues and where there
is calmness.
also need the father to take the time to consider his position that he is
holding forward in respect to future time with the children
and also to reflect
on what has happened in the Court over the last couple of days.
am further going to make an order that the father is not to go to any soccer
games between now and when the matter comes back before

and counsel for the respondent and the Independent
Children’s Lawyer, in
the absence of the self-represented appellant.
is, at least, surprising that these
exchanges were allowed to
occur, both on the part of the primary judge, as well as on the part of counsel
for each of the respondent
and the Independent Children’s Lawyer.
Legal Profession Uniform Conduct (Barristers) Rules 2015
provides that:
barrister must not, outside an
application or a hearing of which
an opponent has had proper notice, communicate in the opponent’s absence
with the court concerning
any matter of substance in connection with current
proceedings unless:
(a) the court has first communicated with the barrister in such a way as to
require the barrister to respond to the court, or
(b) the opponent has consented beforehand to the barrister dealing with
the court in a specific manner notified to the opponent
by the barrister.
arguably, the exception in paragraph (a) may have been engaged, in that the
Court conceivably had first communicated with
both counsel in such a way as to
require them to respond to the Court, no concern was expressed by them as their
exchanges with the
primary judge unfolded, regarding the absence of the
self-represented appellant.
Notwithstanding
that the primary judge said at [13]–[14] of her reasons that, after the
appellant’s lawyers withdrew and
he became self-represented, in accordance

“every attempt was made the ensure that fair process was afforded to the
[appellant]”, the transcript of the
exchanges between her
Honour and counsel for the other parties, in his absence, whilst unrepresented,
manifestly reveals otherwise.
It would also appear that her Honour’s
reference to the decision of the High Court

[2000] HCA 48
201 CLR 488
was incorrect, not being on point, and that she intended, in fact,
to refer to the decision of the Full Court in

unrepresented litigants was specified by the Full
Johnson & Johnson

maintained at all times”. In
at [250] this was reformulated,
as the first (rather than seventh) guideline, as follows:
“A judge should ensure as far as is possible that procedural fairness is
afforded to all parties whether represented or appearing
in person in order to
ensure a fair trial;”

did not occur.
Remarkably,
in the respondent’s Summary of Argument, it is contended, albeit
unsurprisingly unsupported by reference to any
authority, that there was no
prejudice to the appellant in the primary judge raising the matter of a
psychiatric assessment in his
absence (at paragraph 16) and that it was
“entirely appropriate”, before raising this issue with the
appellant, that
there be “some exploration as between the legal
representatives and the Court such as how any such report would be paid for.
Particularly, given that the Court was being assisted by an experienced ICL and
counsel” (sic) (at paragraph 22).
those submissions blithely disregard the fact that the “exploration
between the legal representatives and the Court”,
and the fact that the
Court “was being assisted by an experienced ICL and counsel”, did
not include any legal representation
on behalf of the appellant. Further, it is
clear from the transcript that, in the absence of the self-represented
appellant, he having
been excluded by the primary judge, more transpired than
merely “some exploration ... as how [sic] any such report would be
respondent also submits, as if in mitigation of the denial of procedural
fairness to the appellant, and any consequent miscarriage
of justice by reason
thereof, that “[t]hereafter the matter was raised with the [appellant] in
open court and the matter considered”
(at paragraph 17); the appellant was
subsequently provided with a full transcript of the hearing “to that
point”, including
the hearing from which he was excluded (at paragraph
18); and, when the part-heard trial subsequently resumed, nearly three weeks
later, on 18–19 November 2024, the appellant was represented by new
solicitors and counsel, who had the benefit of the transcript
(at paragraphs
19–20). However, in the circumstances, that is no answer to the complaint
in Ground 1 that, in conducting part
of the proceedings in the absence of the
appellant, whilst self-represented, he was denied procedural fairness and a
miscarriage
of justice occurred.
is one thing for a judge to speak to
counsel, in the absence of the
parties whom they represent; it is entirely a different, and unacceptable, thing
for a judge to speak
to counsel for some parties, in the absence of a
self-represented party. Whilst the end to which the primary judge aspired may
conceivably
have been understandable, it in no way justified the means employed
by her Honour to attain same. In circumstances where the appellant
self-represented, her Honour should not have excluded him from her discussions

at 109, albeit in

“trivial breaches” of

requirement therefor may fluctuate. At [60], their Honours said:

its precise or practical content is controlled by
any relevant statutory
provisions and, within the relevant legislative framework, this will vary
according to the circumstances of
the particular case.

Russell v. Duke of Norfolk
, Tucker L.J. said: “The requirements
of natural justice must depend of the circumstances of the case, the nature of
the inquiry,
the rules under which the tribunal is acting, the subject-matter
that is being dealt with, and so forth.” The passage has frequently
approved - for example, by this Court in
Reg. v. Commonwealth Conciliation
and Arbitration Commission; Ex parte Angliss Group
. The authorities show
that natural justice does not require the inflexible application of a fixed body
of rules; it requires fairness
in all the circumstances, which include the
nature of the jurisdiction or power exercised and the statutory provisions
its exercise. Moreover, as Stephen J. said in
Salemi v. MacKellar
[No.2], the rules of natural justice "may also vary from case to case
although each be conducted before one and the same tribunal
or person".
(Footnotes omitted)
will also be recalled that, in
Genesalio & Genesalio
National Companies and Securities Commission v
News Corporation Limited
, the Full Court said at [38] that “[t]he
rules of natural justice, which do not have immutably fixed content, are applied
practically
to ensure fairness”.
the present case, I consider the exclusion of the self-represented appellant
from the Court by the primary judge, whilst she and
counsel for the respondent
and the Independent Children’s Lawyer engaged in
discussions regarding matters that were not, as her Honour told him, merely
procedural in nature (if that even mattered), to be such
an egregious denial of
procedural fairness to him as to constitute manifestly a miscarriage of justice.
As the authorities make clear,
not only must justice be done, it must also be
seen to be done. That is not to say that justice was even done. It is clear from
transcript that, in the absence of the appellant, the primary judge and
counsel for the respondent agreed that a psychiatric assessment
of him would be
of no utility. After the luncheon adjournment, when the appellant was allowed by
the primary judge to resume participation
in the trial, he told her Honour that
he would undertake such an assessment. Nevertheless, her Honour later ruled, as
she had foreshadowed
in his absence, against such an assessment.
without the application for a suspension of time actually being made, which was
foreshadowed by counsel for the respondent
and discussed with the primary judge
in the appellant’s absence, and without the appellant subsequently being
heard in relation
thereto, her Honour proceeded to so order.
