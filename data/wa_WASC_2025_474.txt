accused, Ian Ralph Brooke, has been charged on indictment that on 20 November
2023, he murdered Jordan John Rivers. Mr Brooke
is unfit to stand trial
due to his intellectual disability.
special proceeding under

Criminal Law (Mental Impairment) Act
) is listed to be heard by me from 1 December 2025.
15 September 2025 I made a number of directions in relation to the conduct of
the special
proceeding.
One of those directions concerned the presence of Mr Brooke at the special
proceeding. Counsel for Mr Brooke, Ms Brennan, sought
an order that
Mr Brooke be excused from personally attending the special proceeding.
That order was sought on the basis that Mr
Brooke's mental state was such
that his attendance at the special proceeding would be detrimental to his
the reasons I then gave, I concluded that where it would cause an accused person
undue distress and potentially adversely affect
their state of mental health for
them to attend a special proceeding, in my view the court has power under s 42
to order, in an
appropriate case, that the special proceeding proceed in the accused's
In the present case, I do not presently have sufficient material before me as to
the potential impact of the special proceedings
upon Mr Brooke to make a final
determination in that regard. Nevertheless, Mr Brooke's counsel indicated that
she would obtain a
report in relation to that question from a psychologist who
is in regular contact with Mr Brooke, Ms Alisha Sah.
therefore made an order, on 15 September 2025,
The question of whether the accused attends the special proceeding will be
determined on the papers prior to the proceeding following
receipt of a report
from Ms Alison Sah.
the evening of 28 October 2025, Ms Brennan advised my chambers that she had been
informed by Ms Sah that Ms Sah was no longer
permitted to provide a report,
despite Ms Sah having informed Ms Brennan on 25 September 2025 that she had been
granted permission
to do so. Ms Brennan also confirmed that in response to other
inquires she had made, that the Department of Justice's Psychological
Service does not provide reports, letters, or any form of professional opinion
for use in court or legal proceedings under
any circumstances.
listed an urgent directions hearing the following day. In addition to the
parties, Mr Lloyd from the State Solicitor's Office
appeared, at short notice,
for the Department of Justice. I record my gratitude for his doing so.
the directions hearing on 29 October 2025, Ms Brennan confirmed that she was
comfortable asking Ms Sah the questions 'cold' (that
is without a written
report) as to whether or not Mr Brooke's attendance at the proceedings for the
special proceedings would cause
him distress or would adversely affect him.
Accordingly, I adjourned the directions hearing to 6 November 2025 and I granted
to the accused to issue a witness summons to Ms Sah pursuant to
Criminal Procedure Act 2004
(WA) to attend and give evidence on that day.
be clear, I adopted this course not because of any reluctance on the part of Ms
Sah to provide the necessary information to the
Court, but to avoid any
difficulty that she might have as a consequence of not having 'permission' to do
3 November 2025 Ms Allen of the State Solicitor's Office forwarded a copy of a
report from Ms Sah in relation to Mr Brooke, obviating
the need for the
directions hearing on 6 November 2025.
Allen confirmed that, while Ms Sah was not aware of the orders that I had made
on 15 September 2025, she had been informed by
Ms Brennan that she has been
nominated to provide information to the Court and that she had confirmed in the
email to Ms Brennan
of 25 September 2025 that she had been granted
permission to provide that information. Ms Allen confirmed that the contrary
was only first conveyed to Ms Brennan on 27 October 2025.
information provided by Ms Brennan as to what had occurred at the directions
hearing on 15 September 2025 was, of course, entirely
correct. Ms Brennan had
indeed nominated Ms Sah as a person able to provide a report. The order that I
made was not an order directed
to Ms Sah to prepare a report but an order
that I would determine the issue of Mr Brooke's attendance upon receipt of a
report from
Ms Sah. Until 28 October 2025 there was no suggestion of any
difficulty in providing the report, such that it would require an
compelling its provision.
that as it may, the report has now been provided. In the report Ms Sah concisely
but comprehensively sets out Mr Brooke's current
presentation and the
issues arising from her interactions with him. The report
In recent months Ian has consistently asked that he not be present in court
during sentencing. ... Mr Brooke has reported that his
experience in the courts

overwhelming.
It is my clinical opinion that Ian's mental health and wellbeing would be
adversely impacted from having to be present at the special
proceedings for this
charge, where the court will be receiving evidence about Ian's actions with
respect to his brother. An exacerbation
of the risk and vulnerability factors
outlined above would be expected during this period, which would be likely to
place him added

thank Ms Sah for her report.
light of Ms Sah's opinion, I have no hesitation in making an order under s 42 of
that the special
proceeding proceed in Mr Brooke's absence, given the risk to Mr Brooke in his
attending. In that context, I am
confident that Mr Brooke's best interests will
be well met by Ms Brennan's representation of him.
therefore order that the special proceeding listed for 1 December 2025 proceed
in the accused's absence.
certify that the preceding paragraphs comprise the reasons for decision of the
Supreme Court of Western Australia.
