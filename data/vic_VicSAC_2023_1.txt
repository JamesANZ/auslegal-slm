Aggregate Prison Sentences in Victoria [2023] VicSAC 1; (18 April 2023)
Aggregate Prison Sentences in Victoria
Sentencing Advisory Council
Introduction
aggregate prison sentence involves a court imposing a single prison sentence on
multiple criminal offences rather than a separate
prison sentence on each
offence. Table 1 illustrates the difference between aggregate and non-aggregate
prison sentences. In the
first example, the offender has received a single
aggregate prison sentence of two years for aggravated burglary and theft. And in
the second example, the offender has received separate non-aggregate prison
sentences for the same two offences. The end result in
both examples is
identical – a two-year total sentence – but the method of arriving
at that total sentence differs.

There are a number of advantages to aggregate sentencing. It can
significantly improve court efficiency, especially in cases with
a large number
of charges. It can avoid the impression of ‘artificiality’ in the
sentencing process, particularly if
there is an impression that the court has
determined the most appropriate total effective sentence that is proportionate
to the overall
offending, but then has adjusted the various charge-level
and cumulation
to achieve that
It can also reduce
calculation errors that may occur when charge-level sentences are made wholly or
partly cumulative or concurrent,
again especially in cases with a large number
of charges. Aggregate sentencing can also, however, reduce transparency in
sentencing,
limit courts’ ability to assess current sentencing practices
and, as this paper shows, result in some offences receiving sentences
of their maximum penalty.
There has, to date, been no examination of Victorian courts’ use of
aggregate prison sentences since their introduction in 1997.
The aims of this
paper are to utilise court data to review trends in the use of aggregate prison
sentences in Victoria, and to then
consider issues arising from their use.

character’.
These are now
known as aggregate sentences of imprisonment, and they are available in most
Australian jurisdictions.
There have been relatively few changes to
since its introduction, and those changes have revolved around the use
of aggregate prison sentences in the higher courts. In 2006,
the power to impose
an aggregate prison sentence was extended to the higher

to specify that the higher courts are not required to state the sentences that

they been sentenced separately, or the
extent to which those sentences would have been concurrent or
cumulative.

some circumstances where they are not allowed. These include

There were 52 such
judgments, all from the County Court. In almost half of those cases, the court
did not explain why an aggregate

remaining 27 cases, the reasoning was exclusively by reference to the
legislative
precondition that, as one court described it, the ‘offences

difficult to envisage other reasons that a court could give, other than perhaps
some explication of how the offences were considered
the same or similar. This
is most likely why the Court of Appeal has described this obligation of reasons
for aggregate sentencing
as a ‘technical
requirement’.

makes clear, failing ‘to give
reasons or to comply with any other procedural requirement ... does not
invalidate’ a sentence.
In that context, there is perhaps a question
whether courts should continue to be required to give reasons for imposing an
prison sentence.

Increasing use of aggregate prison sentences
Over the last decade,
there has been a substantial increase in the total number of criminal offences
sentenced in the Magistrates’
Court (see the Appendix). From 1 January
2011 to 31 December 2019 (excluding 2020 due to the decline in the number of
matters finalised
during COVID-19 restrictions) the number of charges sentenced
annually in that jurisdiction increased by 50% from about 204,000 to
307,000, an
increase well in excess of the growth in Victoria’s population in that
same timeframe.
In contrast, the
number of charges dealt with in the higher courts remained relatively stable,
fluctuating between about 6,500 and
8,000 charges per year (also see the
Proportion of charge-level sentences that were prison
sentences, by jurisdiction and year

Both the Magistrates’ Court and the higher courts, however, shared an
increasing rate at which sentenced charges received imprisonment
(Figure 1),
from 65% to 75% in the higher courts and from 11% to 24% in the
Magistrates’ Court (again excluding 2020). This
increase was not just at
the charge level; from 2010–11 to 2019–20, the rates of case-level
prison sentences increased
from 52.6% to 75.1% in the higher courts and from
4.4% to 13.0% in the Magistrates’
As the Council has
previously observed, the increasing rate of prison sentences in Victoria is due
to a combination of factors, such
as bail law reforms increasing the number of

suspended prison sentences,
a number of legislative amendments to sentencing law intentionally designed to
increase the rate of prison

Over the next two years,
the rate then soared to over 1,000 charges in a single year (almost one-quarter
of all charge-level prison
sentences in 2015), declining moderately since then.
This is perhaps due to the 2010 and 2012 legislative reforms simplifying the
of aggregate sentences in the higher courts. In the Magistrates’ Court,
the rate was already high in 2011 (82%) and has
increased further since then,
hovering at 91% of all prison sentences in the four years to

Number of charges in each aggregate prison sentence
Between 2011 and 2020,
there were 59,127 distinct aggregate prison sentences imposed in the
Magistrates’ Court (in 51,159 cases
covering 449,760
and 1,352 distinct
aggregate prison sentences imposed in the higher courts (in 1,209 cases covering
6,787 charges). There was an
average of 7.6 charges per aggregate prison
sentence in the Magistrates’ Court and 5.0 in the higher courts.
Where there are only two charges in a case, or ‘only a small number of
the Court of
Appeal has cautioned that ‘an aggregate sentence will rarely, if ever, be
appropriate’, particularly if
one of the offences ‘is much more
serious than the other’.
There were many aggregate prison sentences covering a large number of charges,
including ones covering 376 charges, 243 charges and
222 charges. In such cases,
the sheer number of charges would mean that an aggregate prison sentence would
usually be the logical
approach. However, Figure 3 shows that many aggregate
prison sentences covered three charges or less (59.1% in the higher courts
36.7% in the Magistrates’ Court). In the higher courts at least, this
could be because cases with a high number of charges
often involve offences or
offenders that would prevent the imposition of an aggregate prison sentence (for
example, a standard sentence
offence, a ‘serious offender’ or a
combination of state and federal sex offences).

Offence types receiving aggregate prison sentences
Figure 4 shows that
fraud and related offences had the highest rate of
sentences of all offence classifications (93.8% of prison sentences for this
offence type). This is most likely because many
fraud cases involved multiple
charges of related offences.
Aggregate prison sentences were also especially common for burglary offences
(91.7%) – this is most likely because (a) burglary
is commonly a
high-volume offence, with offenders committing a string of related
burglaries,
and (b) the nature
of burglary is that the offender tends to trespass unlawfully to commit some
other offence, such as theft or assault.
There was, though, not much variation
between offence categories, with more than four in five prison sentences being

In terms of trends, there was a general increase in the rate of aggregate

From 2011 to 2020, the rate of aggregate prison sentences for assault and injury
offences increased from 69.4%
to 84.4% of prison sentences, and for traffic and
vehicle offences from 70.7% to 86.6%. In contrast, the rate of aggregate prison
sentences for fraud and related offences was already above 90% in 2011, so the
increase was less apparent, from 90.9% to 95.0% of
prison sentences. In effect,

Advantages of aggregate sentencing
There are two major
advantages to aggregate sentencing, which together are probably why aggregate
sentencing is used so frequently
in the Magistrates’ Court, and why the
Australian Law Reform Commission found ‘limited opposition’ to the
aggregate sentencing.
First, aggregate sentencing offers significant efficiency savings. It is not
uncommon for the Magistrates’ Court to hear cases
of charges, many of
which are often similar and related. Sentencing such charges together vastly
reduces the amount of time spent
identifying individual charge-level sentences
for each, particularly given that sentencing courts must apply the principle of

bulk of criminal cases in

and the specified total effective sentence.
Warner has made similar
observations.
So too has the
Court of Appeal.
Disadvantages of aggregate sentencing
There are also several
disadvantages to aggregate sentencing. Many of these are well known and have
been canvassed by Warner in 1987
as well as the Australian
Law Reform Commission in 2006.
Some, however, are less well known.
1. Reduced transparency in sentencing
Aggregate sentencing can
reduce transparency in sentencing in two ways: first, within individual cases
and second, in current sentencing
practices more generally.
A. Reduced ability to scrutinise individual
Being unable to discern the contribution of any
particular offence to the total sentence imposed can detrimentally affect
offenders and the broader
If victims cannot
identify how each offence was sentenced, they may feel dissatisfied with the
sentencing process because they cannot
see how any offences committed against
them have been reflected in the total
Similarly, as has been
observed by Kirby J (in dissent), aggregate sentencing creates ‘serious
disadvantages’ for offenders
in identifying whether the underlying
mechanics of the sentencing exercise were unjust or not:
In practical terms, it makes the offender’s task of challenging the
unidentified components of the aggregate sentence much
more difficult. It risks
depriving the offender of the provision of adequate reasons for the components
of the sentence. It undermines
the objective of identifying differential
sentences ... so that their content might be known ... It diminishes the
effectiveness
of the deterrent value of particularised sentences ... In the case
of indictable offences specificity in sentencing is at a premium.
because the punishment (including ... loss of liberty) is typically greater and
more onerous. It should therefore be identified
identifiable.
For example, in
Fitzpatrick v The Queen
, an offender had appealed
against an aggregate prison sentence, in part, because ‘it was submitted
that there was clearly something
wrong with the imposition of an aggregate
sentence of four years and nine months for a series of offences that include
minor charges’.
It was therefore, at least in part, the offender’s inability to scrutinise
the underlying mechanics of the total effective
sentence that motivated their
sentence appeal.
B. Reduced ability to assess current sentencing
In a broader context, courts in Victoria are
legislatively obligated to take ‘current sentencing practices’ into
when sentencing someone.
While the weight courts can attribute to current sentencing practices was
diluted by the High Court in
they nevertheless remain
an important consideration. An assessment of current sentencing practices will
generally require consideration
of both ‘relevant sentencing statistics
for the offence and ... sentencing decisions in comparable
To assist courts
in that assessment, the Council regularly publishes statistics in relation to
how certain offences are sentenced
in Victoria (for example, how often a CCO is
imposed for an offence or how long prison sentences are).
One of the consequences of such high rates of aggregate sentencing,
particularly in the Magistrates’ Court, is that it becomes
very difficult
to provide reliable insights into current sentencing practices for offences
receiving imprisonment. There is no way
to discern what contribution each
offence makes to an aggregate prison sentence (and there is nothing useful to be
gleaned from knowing
the length of an aggregate prison sentence imposed for
multiple offences). If 91% of charges receiving imprisonment are part of an
aggregate prison sentence, that only leaves 9% of prison sentences from which to
gauge current sentencing practices. Such a small
sample size may not actually
reflect current sentencing practices about the lengths of prison sentences for
certain offences. For
example, if charges of a certain offence that receive
non-aggregate prison sentences are in general more serious than charges bundled
into aggregate prison sentences, then the prison sentences imposed on those 9%
of charges could give the impression that sentences
for that offence are longer
than might have been the case had all charges of that offence received
non-aggregate prison sentences.
2. Aggregate prison sentences for unrelated offences
Section 9(1)
Sentencing Act
only allows charges to be part of the same aggregate
prison sentence if they ‘are founded on the same facts, or form, or are
part of, a series of offences of the same or a similar character’. As the
Court of Appeal has observed,
this is the same precondition that must be met for offences to appear together
on the same charge sheet or
indictment.
While this seems to
suggest that most charges in a case should be capable of being part of an
aggregate prison sentence,
are at least three circumstances where offences in a case will not be
sufficiently ‘related’ to justify an aggregate
prison sentence.
The first is when a court is dealing with ‘unrelated summary
offences’ in the higher
or a consolidated case in
the Magistrates’ Court.
both instances, the offences do not appear on the same indictment or charge
sheet and therefore may not be allowed to be part
of the same aggregate
sentence. For instance, in
Fitzpatrick v The Queen,
the Court of Appeal
observed that while an unrelated summary offence of unlicensed driving was
‘temporally connected’
to the other offences in the case (family
violence offending), it ‘certainly did not form part of a “series of
of the same or a similar
character”’.
The second is when offences are not based on sufficiently similar facts. The
offence of failing to answer bail, for example, would

on the same or similar facts), yet 88.6%
of the 6,350 charges of failing to
answer bail receiving prison sentences in the three years to 30 June 2021 were
part of an aggregate
The Court of Appeal
also recently, in
Guo v The Queen
, overturned an aggregate period of
youth detention for two offences – aggravated burglary and possessing a
prohibited weapon
– because they were not adequately
The offender had
committed an aggravated burglary in early November, and four weeks later police

of which had been used in the aggravated
burglary) while executing a search warrant at his house. The Court of Appeal
the imposition of an aggregate sentence in this case to constitute
specific error, therefore ‘the sentencing discretion [was]
regardless of whether the appellate court would have imposed a different
And the third is when two offences are of ‘significantly different
seriousness’. The Court of Appeal has suggested on
multiple occasions that
an aggregate sentence may not be appropriate for offences that are too
dissimilar in seriousness, even if
founded on related factual circumstances. For
instance, in
Sinclair v The Queen
, the offender had been a passenger in a
car he knew was stolen (theft), and he was again a passenger in the same stolen
car the next
day, during which he committed an armed robbery against a woman at
a shopping centre. The court held that the different level of
seriousness
between the armed robbery and the theft meant that an aggregate sentence
‘was not reasonably
Similarly, in
Fitzpatrick v The Queen
, the Court of Appeal held that the aggravating
features of one of the charges (common assault) made it ‘significantly
serious’ than the other offences in the case. And while the court did
not interfere with the original sentence in that case,
it did suggest that the
sentencing court ‘ought to have given greater thought to whether it was
appropriate in the particular
circumstances of this case to impose an aggregate
v The Queen
, the Court of Appeal – again without
interfering with the original sentence – said that ‘this was not an
appropriate
case for an aggregate sentence’ and cautioned judges ‘to
ensure that the aggregate sentence power is reserved for cases
of the type
described in the
authorities’.
Stevens v The Queen
, the Court of Appeal described it as
‘inappropriate’ for an aggregate sentence to have been imposed for
two offences
– trafficking in a drug of dependence and dealing with
suspected proceeds of crime – because of ‘the marked disparity
the seriousness of the charges and the fact that one of them ... was unlikely to
attract a custodial sentence on its
The court described
‘the sentencing process [as] distorted by “squeezing” the
proceeds charges into a sentence
that had been arrived at by reference to
another, far more serious offence’, which resulted in that offence
receiving a ‘manifestly
That is, the aggregate
prison sentence for the proceeds of crime charge amounted to not only specific
error but also manifest excess.
Despite this case law, though, which seems to have originated in
, the requirement of
similar levels of seriousness does not expressly appear in
Sentencing Act
, so it is not clear what might be the legislative basis
for this requirement.
3. Imprisonment (and CCOs) for fine-only offences
Section 111
Sentencing Act
makes clear that people cannot receive a penalty
‘exceeding that set out’ in the relevant offence provision. This
to both sentence lengths and types. If the maximum prison sentence that
can be imposed for a single charge is 6 months, then a 12-month
non-aggregate
prison sentence would be
impermissible.
Equally, if the
maximum penalty for an offence is a fine, then a prison sentence is not
permissible at all.
maximum penalty for an offence is a fine of 5 penalty units or less, then a CCO
is impermissible.
It appears,
however, that many offences in Victoria have been receiving sentences in excess
of their maximum penalty.
Imprisonment for fine-only offences
A review of Magistrates’ Court data from 2011
to 2020 shows that there were at
7,358 charges in 4,989
cases that received imprisonment despite the maximum penalty for those offences
being a fine (Figure 6). From
2011 to 2018, the number of prison sentences for
fine-only offences increased sixfold from 212 to
The number has decreased
since 2018, though the number for 2020 would have been affected by the reduced
ability of courts to finalise
cases during COVID-19 restrictions. The vast
majority of those fine-only offences receiving imprisonment were recorded as
prison sentence imposed for multiple charges
in a case (94%). This would seem to suggest that aggregate sentencing could be
the main drivers, if not
main driver, of the imposition of
prison sentences on offences for which a prison sentence is not permissible.
Figure 6: Number of charges of fine-only offences that received
imprisonment in the Magistrates’ Court, by year (7,358 charges
Number of charges receiving imprisonment
While the imposition of prison sentences for fine-only offences is most
apparent in the Magistrates’ Court, it has also occurred
in the higher
courts. A very small number of charges (28) of fine-only offences also received
imprisonment in the higher courts in
the five years to 30 June
The offences most affected by this issue in the Magistrates’ Court are
shown in Figure 7.
The offences are varied, with the nine most common including a firearm
offence, driving offences, police and gaol offences, drug offences,
and a public
order offence.

CCOs for fine-only offences with a maximum of 5 penalty
units or less
This issue of sentences in excess of the maximum
does not seem to be limited to fine-only offences receiving
imprisonment.
While CCOs are more severe in Victoria’s sentencing hierarchy than a fine
section 37(a)
Sentencing Act
does allow fine-only offences to receive a CCO in some
circumstances, but only if the offence is ‘punishable by more than 5
penalty units’. Even if another offence in the case meets that minimum
threshold, the Court of Appeal has clarified that for
offences with a maximum
fine of 5 penalty units or less, it is ‘not open to [a] judge as a matter
of law to impose a CCO on
Therefore, if a
court imposes a CCO on other offences in a case, any offences that cannot
receive a CCO must be disposed of in some
other manner, such as with a fine, a
concurrent adjourned undertaking, or by dismissal of the charge with or without
conviction.
Despite the unavailability of CCOs for fine-only offences with a maximum fine
of 5 penalty units or less, court data suggests that
CCOs are frequently imposed
for such offences (Figure 8). Between 2012 and
there were 7,999 charges
in 5,884 cases that received a CCO despite the relevant offence having a maximum
of 5 penalty units or less.
The number of such sentences increased substantially
in 2015, which accords with the equally significant increase in the use of CCOs
generally that year

The decline in

to be responsible for the imposition of

Concluding remarks
Aggregate prison
sentences constitute the vast majority of prison sentences in the
Magistrates’ Court, even more so in 2020
than in 2011, and they have
become more prevalent in the higher courts. Their introduction in 1997 was
intended to ‘reduce
the risk of technical sentencing
and prevent an
‘air of artificiality’ in the sentencing process for a series of
related acts. They are also far more
efficient than individual charge-level
sentences, especially in cases with a large number of charges. This advantage
cannot be overstated.
There has been a significant increase in the number of
cases and charges dealt with in the Magistrates’ Court each year. And
courts and practitioners must navigate increasingly complex sentencing
legislation.
These practical realities must frame the analysis that follows, because it is
most likely the pressures resulting from overwhelming
demand that are causing
errors to be made. Offences that are not sufficiently ‘related’ are
often receiving an aggregate
sentence, which is not permitted by legislation.
Moreover, at a conservative
there were over
15,000 offences in the last decade that impermissibly received either a prison
sentence or a CCO in excess of their
maximum penalties (an issue that is
statewide and not specific to any particular court location or justice
In almost every
instance, the charge receiving a sentence in excess of its maximum penalty was
bundled with other more serious offences
to receive an aggregate prison
sentence, suggesting that the process of aggregate sentencing is the cause of
this issue.
We met with representatives from a number of key organisations in the legal
profession to discuss our findings, and they all agreed
that those offences were
very unlikely to have affected the total effective sentence in these cases (that
is, the length of the prison
sentence, the conditions of the CCO, etc.) But
neither is it possible to say so definitively, due to the inherent lack of
transparency
in aggregate sentencing. Further, even if these errors are both
understandable and have little effect on actual sentences, they are
nevertheless
not in accordance with the law, and the issue should be addressed. As to how it
should be addressed, there are a number
of possible options, such as changes in
court practice and/or legislative
In summary, there are both advantages and disadvantages in the use of
aggregate sentencing. On the one hand, it can reduce artificiality
sentencing, significantly improve efficiency and reduce technical error. On the
other hand, it can limit accurate insights into
current sentencing practices,
prevent victims, offenders and the broader community from
‘unpacking’ how multiple offences
contributed to the total sentence,
and result in offences receiving impermissible sentences. Nevertheless,
aggregate sentencing plays
a critical role in Victoria’s criminal justice
system, particularly given the increasing volume and complexity of cases.

within a case, whereas a case-level sentence is
the total effective sentence
imposed on all the charges in a case.
imposing separate non-aggregate prison sentences on different charges in a case,
courts will typically specify one of the charge-level
sentences as the base
sentence, and then further specify whether each other prison sentence is wholly
concurrent, wholly cumulative,

This is consistent with the

Court of Criminal Appeal
has held that a prohibition on aggregate prison
sentences for certain offences ‘seems to be to ensure that any mandatory
required to be imposed are not only imposed but are seen to be

most aggregate prison sentences are imposed in the Magistrates’ Court,
access to Magistrates’ Court sentencing remarks
is only available via
prohibitively resource-intensive measures such as requesting audio recordings of
sentencing hearings or conducting
in-court observations. We limited our review
to publicly available sentencing remarks published by the Australasian Legal
information
Institute (AustLII). There did not appear to be any aggregate prison
sentences imposed in the Supreme Court in the second half of
v Foster (A Pseudonym)
[2021] VCC 2132
, [71]. The most detailed explanations
were in the following:
DPP v Hughes
[2021] VCC 1680
, in which the court
indicated that it was imposing an aggregate prison sentence ‘because I see
the circumstances of these offences
being so similar in nature, albeit they vary
in value of the victim’s loss, but occurring over one month and are
essentially,
exactly the same type of offence’: [32];
DPP v Verdesoto
[2021] VCC 1319
, in which defence counsel advocated an aggregate prison
sentence, the prosecution did not take issue with that submission, and the
imposed an aggregate sentence because ‘the offences all arise out of your
actions in buying, selling and trading in illicit
property and drugs, and all
relate to items found during the search of your properties’: [60]; and
DPP v Cakebread & Anor
[2021] VCC 1237
, in which the court said that
‘[t]hose petrol charges are all very similar. I’m going to bundle
them together [to] give
you one sentence on all of them to make it
simpler’: [115].

While not described in legislation as
‘aggregate’ sentences, CCOs covering multiple offences operate in
the same manner,
which is why we have described them as quasi-aggregate. It was
also possible to impose a single community order on multiple offences
2012; CCOs were introduced in 2012 to replace a number of sentencing options,
including community-based orders:
Sentencing Act 1991
(repealed). Notably, there was previously no restriction on which offences could
be covered by a single community-based order, but
the current provisions
restrict the imposition of a single CCO for multiple offences in the same way as
they restrict the imposition
of aggregate prison sentences, to offences that
‘are founded on the same facts or form or are part of a series of offences
of the same or a similar character’:

There does not appear to have been an equivalent power
to impose an aggregate fine in the predecessor legislation, the

(1987), above n 3, 341–342:
It is difficult, particularly when
a large number of offences are involved, to avoid a degree of artificiality in
imposing separate
sentences on each count which must be adjusted to add up to an
appropriate total by orders for concurrent and cumulative sentences
rules relating to the exercise of the discretion to impose concurrent or
cumulative sentences are not always easy to apply.
v Frewstal Pty Ltd
[2015] VSCA 266
The kind of case for
which an aggregate sentence is appropriate is one where the number, similarity
and proximity in time of the offences
is such that it would be an artificial
exercise to impose individual sentences and then, by means of modest orders for
cumulation,
to arrive at a total effective sentence proportionate to the total
criminality.

course, non-aggregate prison sentences present this same risk in a different
way, because the principle of totality can result
in courts ordering significant
periods of concurrency between charge-level sentences, such that some offences
in the case can appear
to have little (if any) apparent effect on the overall
sentence imposed.
v The Queen
[2004] HCA 8
, [116], [119]. On a related point, if an offender
was to successfully appeal a conviction in relation to one or more of the
in an aggregate sentence, it forces the appellate court to resentence
all of the other offences afresh because the aggregate sentence
can no longer
stand: see, for example,
O’Connell & Ors v The Queen
[1844] EngR 880
, 1061: ‘A good finding on a bad count, and a bad finding on a good
count, stand on the same footing; both being nullities’.

is the same requirement for offences to be

the aggregate prison sentence for multiple offences can permissibly exceed the
maximum of one or more offences in that bundle

Fitzpatrick v The

is a conservative estimate. If the maximum penalty for an offence was
imprisonment in some instances but not others, it was assumed
that all prison
sentences were lawful. For example,
section 49(2A)
Road Safety Act
(Vic) specifies that a fine of no more than 20 penalty units applies to
certain drink-driving offences as a first offence, but on
a second offence a
prison sentence of not more than six months is possible. There were hundreds of
charges of these offences that
received a prison sentence between 2011 and 2020;
it was assumed they were all for second or subsequent offences.

however, commencement has been delayed
until November 2023:
Legislation Amendment Act 2022
v The Queen
[2022] VSCA 5
nine-year reference period is used here because CCOs only came into effect in
January 2012:
Sentencing Amendment (Community Correction Reform) Act 2011
2013–14, there were about 7,300 CCOs imposed, and two years later that had
increased to about 10,500: Sentencing Advisory
Council (2022), above n 28.
v The Queen; Clements v the Queen; Fitzgerald v the Queen
[2014] VSCA 342.
in some rare cases multiple CCOs have been imposed in the same case, courts
usually impose one CCO per case, covering a number
of offences.
offences mostly relate to
Road Safety (Vehicles) Regulations 2009
Road Safety (Drivers) Regulations 2009
(Vic) (22%),
Road Safety
(Vic) (10%) and
Road Safety Road Rules 2017
(Vic) (3%).
Parliamentary Debates
, Legislative Assembly, 24 April 1997, 875 (Jan
Wade, Attorney-General).
above n 91.
12 court locations where the largest number of CCOs and prison sentences were
imposed in circumstances where they were not permissible
were also the
headquarter courts: Melbourne (19.5% of the 7,032 impermissible
prison sentences and 14.2% of the 7,428 impermissible CCOs); Sunshine
12.7%); Ringwood (9.2% and 8.4%); Heidelberg (8.8% and 6.1%); La Trobe Valley
(6.8% and 4.6%); Dandenong (5.9% and 8.4%);
Frankston (5.3% and 8.4%); Geelong
(4.9% and 4.0%); Broadmeadows (4.9% and 4.3%); Ballarat (3.4% and 3.9%); Bendigo
(3.3% and 3.0%);
Shepparton (2.9% and 2.5%).
one example,
Sentencing Act
(Vic) could
potentially be amended to allow all fine-only offences to receive a CCO so long
as at least one offence receiving that
CCO has a maximum of more than 5 penalty
