recycling company. The bin was not secured in any way and its contents were able
and were in fact accessed by, members of the public.

the manner described in paragraph 4 above, has
disclosed information which is
confidential to a client and which was acquired by the Respondent Lawyer during
the client’s
engagement and amounts to a breach of Rule 9.1 of the

Investigation
complaint is a Commissioner Initiated Complaint made pursuant to section 266(2)
of the Uniform Law. The complaint was initiated
by the Complainant on 6
November 2017.
6 November 2017 and 25 April 2018, various communications were exchanged between
the Complainant and the Respondent Lawyer.
The investigation also involved the
Respondent Lawyer attending the Complainant’s office for a meeting in
November 2017 with
the Complainant and a member of the Complainant’s
response to the allegations made by the Complainant the Respondent Lawyer
events that occurred on 23 (sic) October 2017 were brought to the Respondent
Lawyer’s attention by the article appearing
in ‘The Age’
newspaper on 30 October 2017;
Respondent Lawyer had been at his Mildura office from 26 October
was advised that a bin was put out on the evening of 25 October 2017 at about
7.00pm for collection on the morning 26 October 2017.
The Respondent Lawyer said
he was not aware that this was to occur at this time but that this was a
procedure which was occurring.
The Respondent Lawyer also advised that the files
to be destroyed were vetted by him before they were
was advised that there had been previous occasions when the bin containing
client files was disposed of in the manner described
(at paragraph 4 above)
however the Respondent Lawyer was unable to advise the number of occasions or
when this occurred.
was not aware who accessed the bin and how or why the files were removed and
provided to the Complainant and ‘The Age’
law practice had been culling old files of more than 20 years old covering
1960’s – 1990’s. His law practice
engaged AB recycling to
collect client files which would in turn have them destroyed by Visyboard.
had been advised that “AB Recycling transports the documents to VISY
recycling paper mill in Coolaroo where they are pulped”.
Respondent Lawyer was arranging for future shredding to be done at the Law
Practice’s premises, however since 25 October
2017 the bin has not been
left for collection in the street; the bin has been walked down to the street
upon arrival of the AB Recycling
truck and the contents of the bin are then
emptied in the presence of an employee of the Law Practice.
Respondent Lawyer provided to the Complainant with a copy of a policy / plan
that his law practice will now adopt in relation
to file ownership, retention
and destruction. The policy did not however address how the confidential client
documents will be physically
destroyed and disposed
4 April 2018, the Complainant sent a letter pursuant to section 299(2) of the
Uniform Law to the Respondent Lawyer which gave notice
of the proposed
determination and invited written submissions about the proposed orders.
Respondent Lawyer provided a response by letter dated 25 April
Findings of fact and reasoning on issues under
investigation
Breach of Confidentiality
Complainant alleged that in disposing of the client files and records in the
manner described in paragraph 4 above, the Respondent
Lawyer has breached his
obligations set out in rule 9.1 of the Rules.
Respondent Lawyer’s response confirms that:
incident described at paragraph 4, took place;
was not the first occasion an unsecured bin containing confidential client
documents had been left for collection in the street;
Respondent Lawyer, although not specifically aware that a bin containing client
files was to be left out for collection on 26
October 2017, was aware that
“this was a procedure which was occurring”
the basis of the evidence before me I find the following proved:
Respondent Lawyer’s actions in permitting on 26 October 2017 for an
unsecured bin full of client files and records to be
left for collection by a
paper recycling company on the corner of Little Lonsdale and William Streets,
which was able to be accessed
by member(s) of the public:
is conduct which
breaches rule 9.1 of the Rules because the Respondent Lawyer disclosed
information which is confidential to a client
and acquired by the Respondent
Lawyer during the client’s engagement to any person who is
solicitor who is a partner, principal director or employee of the Respondent
Lawyer’s law practice; or
barrister or an employee of, or person otherwise engaged by, the
solicitor’s law practice or by an associated entity for the
delivering or administering legal services in relation to the
It is noted that none of the exceptions set out in
rule 9.2 of the Rules apply.
Destruction of client files
Complainant alleged that in disposing of the client files and records in the
manner described in paragraph 4 above, the Respondent
Lawyer or his law practice
had not complied with the obligation set out in rule 14.2 to
client files, rather the client files were simply
Respondent Lawyer’s response confirms that:
incident described at paragraph 4, took place.
law practice engaged AB recycling to collect client files and records which
would in turn have them destroyed by Visyboard. The
documents are transported to
a recycling paper mill in Coolaroo where they are pulped.
client files are not destroyed at the time of collection by AB Recycling.
Instead the client files are transported in their original
form (ie: content
identifiable) in a vehicle (which caters for recycling and not secure document
destruction) to a recycling paper
mill where the documents await pulping, again
in their original form.
As far as the Law Practice is
concerned, the client files have been disposed. There is no evidence or
certification from AB Recycling
to confirm that the client files collected from
the Law Practice have actually been destroyed (or pulped).
the basis of the evidence before me I find the following proved:
Law Practice did not comply with the requirement under rule 14.2 of the Rules
that client documents by
after a period of 7 years has elapsed
since the completion or termination of the engagement, except where there are
client instructions
or legislation to the contrary.
By operation of
section 35(1)(a)
and/or (b) of the Uniform Law the Respondent Lawyer is taken to
have contravened rule 14.2 of the Rules because he knowingly authorised
permitted the contravention and/or he ought reasonably to have been in, a
position to influence the conduct of the Law Practice
in relation to its
contravention of the provision and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent
the contravention by the Law Practice.
Further a contravention by a
principal arising under
section 35(1)
is capable of constituting unsatisfactory
professional conduct or professional misconduct by the Respondent Lawyer as the
of the Law Practice.
Relevant law
complaint was initiated pursuant to section 266(2) of the Uniform Law on 6
November 2017, at which time the Uniform Law was in
298(b) of the Uniform Law provides that unsatisfactory professional conduct
includes conduct consisting of a contravention
of the Uniform Rules.
Uniform Rules include a reference to the
Legal Profession Uniform Legal
Practice (Solicitors)
(the Rules).
of the Rules states:
9.1 A solicitor must not disclose any
information which is confidential to a client and acquired by the solicitor
during the client’s
engagement to any person who is not:
9.1.1 a solicitor who is a partner, principal, director or employee of the
solicitor’s law practice; or
9.1.2 a barrister or an employee of, or person otherwise engaged by, the
solicitor’s law practice or by an associated entity
for the purpose of
delivering or administering legal services in relation to the
EXCEPT as permitted in Rule 9.2
9.2 A solicitor may disclose information which is confidential to a
9.2.1 the client expressly or impliedly authorises disclosure;
9.2.2 the solicitor is permitted or is compelled by law to
9.2.3 the solicitor discloses the information in a confidential setting,
for the sole purpose of obtaining advice in connection with
solicitor’s legal or ethical obligations; a serious criminal
9.2.4 the solicitor discloses the information for the sole purpose of
avoiding the probable commission of a serious criminal offence;
9.2.5 the solicitor discloses the information for the purpose of
preventing imminent serious physical harm to the client or to another
9.2.6 the information is disclosed to the insurer of the solicitor, law
practice or associated entity.
14.2 of the Rules states:
14.2 A solicitor or law practice may
destroy client documents after a period of 7 years had elapsed since the
completion of termination
of the engagement, except where there are client
instructions or legislation to the contrary..
35 of the Uniform law states:
35 Liability of
(1) If a law practice contravenes whether by act or omission, any
provision of this Law or the Uniform Rules imposing an obligation
practice, a principal of the law practice is taken to have contravened the same
provision, if –
(a) the principal knowingly authorized or permitted the contravention;
(b) the principal was in, or ought reasonably to have been in, a position
to influence the conduct of the law practice in relation
to its contravention of
the provision and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the contravention
by the law practice.
(2) A contravention by a principal arising under subsection (1) is capable
to constituting unsatisfactory professional conduct or
professional misconduct
by the principal.
(3) Neither subsection (1) or (2) affects any liability of the law
practice or any other person for the
contravention.
Characterisation of the conduct
reason of the above findings of fact I find that the Respondent Lawyer has
contravened rule 9.1 of the Rules and has disclosed
information which is
confidential to his clients and which was acquired by him during the
client’s engagement. By reason of
the above findings of fact I also find
that the Respondent Lawyer’s law practice has contravened the requirement
rule 14.2 of the Rules in that the Law Practice did not
client documents that were eligible for destruction under this rule.
Instead, it appears that by leaving the documents for collection
by AB Recycling
the Law Practice was simply disposing of the documents.
operation of section 30(1) of the Uniform Law the Respondent Lawyer as the
principal of the Law Practice is taken to have contravened
rule 14.2 because he
knowingly authorised or permitted the contravention and/or he ought reasonably
be in a position to influence
the conduct of the Law Practice in relation to
this contravention and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the
contravention
by the Law Practice.
Respondent Lawyer’s conduct is conduct capable of constituting
unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct.
I am satisfied
that the Respondent Lawyer’s conduct falls short of the standard of
competence and diligence that a member of
the public is entitled to expect of a
reasonably competent lawyer but does not go so far as to constitute a
substantial or consistent
failure to reach or maintain a reasonable standard of
competence and diligence.
This is the first occasion that this type of conduct by the Respondent Lawyer
and his Law Practice has been brought to the attention
of the Complainant. In
this regard I do note the Respondent Lawyer’s admission that there had in
the past been other occasions
when the bin containing old client files had been
left out the evening prior for collection, however the Respondent Lawyer appears
to have accepted that his law practice can no longer engage in this practice and
has advised the Complainant that in future client
documents will be shred
in-house prior to their disposal.
The conduct of the Respondent Lawyer and his Law Practice gained media
attention with the incident the subject of this investigation
being reported in
‘The Age’ newspaper on 29 October 2017. This type of conduct
certainly has the potential to diminish
the public’s confidence in the
legal profession and the administration of justice. A client is entitled to
expect that their
confidences and confidential information will be
maintained.
am therefore satisfied that the Respondent Lawyer has:
in unsatisfactory professional conduct within the meaning of section 298(b) in
relation to his breach of rule 9.1 of the Rules;
in unsatisfactory professional conduct by reason of a breach by the Law Practice
of rule 14.2 of the Rules and by reason of
the operation of section 35(2) of the
Uniform Law;
and that his conduct warrants a reprimand and
a fine of $2000.
Determination & reasons
considered all of the evidence and relevant law, and having made the above
findings on the issues under investigation, I determine
that it is fair and
reasonable in all the circumstances to make the orders detailed
to Section 314 of the Uniform Law, a Respondent Lawyer or a legal practitioner
associate of a respondent law practice may,
in accordance with the applicable
legislation appeal to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, or seek a
review by the
VCAT, of this determination made under s299 of the Uniform
Non-compliance
failure to comply with a determination made under s299 is capable of
constituting unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional
pursuant to Section 298 (h) of the Uniform Law.
