APPEARANCES:
Mr A Stewart on behalf of the appellant, Mrs D Stewart
Mr P Prasad, In
House Legal, for the Department
Introduction
and Mrs Stewart live in Biboohra, near Mareeba. Mrs Stewart leases a parcel of
land from the State.
[2] In April
2022, Mrs Stewart applied to have the lease converted to freehold.
Department of Resources
to that application about 828 days later, by setting the purchase price for the
conversion from leasehold to freehold at
[4] Mrs Stewart
thought that amount too high. She sought an internal review.
[5] The internal
review came back at $425,000.
[6] Mrs Stewart
appeals that internal review decision.
[7] She says
that the correct value is $340,000.
[8] Mrs Stewart
raises the following issues:
(a) the internal review decision was required to state reasons but did not;
(b) the amount set by the Department is grossly excessive when compared to the
comparative sales and valuation data.

(a) after proper marketing, where there was an exchange between a willing buyer
and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction;
(b) where the buyer and seller had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without
compulsion.
[12] The powers
of the Court are set out in
section 429

this kind is by way of rehearing.
Department submits that the Appellant has the onus of proof for each of the
grounds of appeal and that the following passage

... the Court has a duty to undertake a two-step process in
considering an appeal. The first step is to determine whether or not the
evidence in its totality supports the case put by an appellant that the issued
valuation is in error, on the balance of probabilities,
so that the onus of
proof is discharged. If the onus of proof is discharged, the second phase of the
evaluation to be undertaken
by the Court comes into play. That is, what is the
correct valuation of the subject land? The Court can only get to a consideration
as to the correct valuation of the subject land and thus,

I am not able to
conclude that the internal review decision in this instance was invalid.
[28] The Court
is equipped with evidence to determine the value of the subject land.
The subject land
[29] The subject
land is 36 Coyle Road, Biboohra. It is three kilometres north of the Biboohra
township and 14 kilometres from Mareeba
[30] It is an 83
hectare corner block. It has an 887 metre road frontage to the Mulligan
Highway, although no access is available
from there. Access is from Coyle Road.
[31] The land
has electricity and telephone services connected. There is no town water or
[32] About 66
hectares has been cleared of vegetation to improve pastures. The remaining 17
hectares is remnant open forest/woodland.
There is a power line that traverses
the property along the old Mount Molly railway line.
[33] The annual
valuation issued by the State Valuation Service for 30 June 2022 was
That is a value
determined under a different statutory regime. I have not used it in the
analysis in this appeal.
The competing positions on the value of
Stewart’s key points about the value of the land are:
(a) the Department’s value of $425,000 is excessive because the
Department’s valuer:
(i) has not taken into account the waterlogging of the property since 2017;
(ii) compared it with other properties that do not accurately reflect the market
value of rural residential lifestyle properties;
(iii) analysed the price of one of the sales (Bilwon Road) on a simplistic basis
which has not been evidenced by broad based market
(iv) has not taken into account all the site characteristics of the subject
(b) the true value of the property is $340,000 based on a report prepared by
Northern Property Valuers dated 29 August 2024.
Department says:
(a) Mrs Stewart has not demonstrated error in the Department’s
(b) as a result, Mrs Stewart has not discharged her onus and the appeal ought to
(c) there should be no generous approach towards the landowner, as this appeal
is more akin to a revenue case than a compensation
The lay evidence
Stewart gave evidence about the characteristics of the subject land.
[37] One of his
key points was that the Department’s figure does not properly account for
the extent to which the property gets
waterlogged. Mr Stewart described the
problem in his evidence and also produced three drone
showing waterlogging on
the property.
[38] He adopted
as his evidence, Attachment 2 of the Appellant’s Statement of Facts and
That document describes
the property as follows:
The property is of near level gradient and
has little natural drainage and can develop areas of waterlogging during the wet
The waterlogging problem has dramatically increase [sic] since about 2017/18
at which time an area of about 200 ha, to the south of
299 NR 7718
cleared and planted to sugar cane. This cane paddock was laser levelled and
drained which has adversely impacted on several
neighbouring properties.
Department of Resources records should be able to identify the relevant dates
that approval was given for
land clearing and drainage works.
Due to the development of this cane property it is estimated that an
additional 15 to 20 ha of land on Lot 299 NR7718 has been impacted
waterlogging problem has been extended and the problem can now occur from
December through to April, a period of 5 months...
[39] I accept Mr
Stewart’s evidence that an additional 15 to 20 hectares of the property
becomes significantly waterlogged between
December and April each
Mr Stewart was challenged
during his cross-examination about not being a hydraulic engineer. He responded
by detailing his experience
as a tobacco and mango farmer in the area near the
subject land.
He knows about
the difference between river flooding, overland flow and drainage problems. Mr
Stewart provided a clear explanation
of the waterlogging issue and maintained
his evidence on the topic throughout his cross-examination. The drone
illustrate the magnitude
of the problem. It is consequential that those videos show water sitting on the
subject land on 28 December
several days after
significant rainfall is recorded as having fallen at the nearby Mareeba
[40] I accept
that waterlogging is a significant negative feature of the property for the
purpose of assessing its value.
The valuation evidence
Department relies on the evidence of Mr Matthew Wilson, a registered valuer and
employee of the State Valuation Service.
He prepared a report and gave oral
[42] Mrs Stewart
filed a valuation report of Mr Russell Jarred, a registered
Mr Jarred was not
produced for cross-examination. Precisely why he was not at Court was not
clear. Mr Stewart said that Mr Jarred
had been willing to provide a report but
was not keen to do more than
[43] The hearing
was stood down for Mr Stewart to contact Mr Jarred or to otherwise consider what
he would like to do with Mr Jarred’s
report. That did not lead to Mr
Jarred being produced.
Department, helpfully, did not object to Mr Jarred’s report being admitted
into evidence.
It said it would
be “a matter of what weight the court should put to that evidence... and
that will be a matter for
submissions”.
Department ultimately submitted that Mr Jarred’s report should be given
very little weight.
[45] I agree
that very little weight should be given to Mr Jarred’s report. I place no
reliance on his opinions given they
were not able to be tested.
[46] In his
report, Mr Wilson responded to Mr Jarred’s report, which assists in
putting the sales in their proper context.
Mr Wilson suggested that Mr Jarred
incorrectly approached his valuation exercise on a rate per square metre basis
– when that
is not how it ought to be done in a case such as this.
Because Mr Jarred was not available to respond to that, that is another reason
am not willing to rely on Mr Jarred’s analysis.
Wilson’s evidence
[47] Mr Wilson
provided an unimproved value for the subject land of $425,000.
[48] He relied
on four sales to reach that conclusion. Two out of those four sales are the
same property – 37 Oaky Valley Avenue,
Mutchilba – which sold twice
in a span of 18 months. Mr Wilson offered this table at page 22 of his

* Denotes an adjusted analysis as referred to in the sales comments.
[49] Each of
those sales was either vacant or of a lightly improved standard for rural
residential homesites. That is similar to
the subject site.
Wilson’s analysis of the sales was based on considerations of land area,
access, flooding and access to water.
Wilson’s role in the valuation of the subject land was slightly unusual.
He produced the first valuation of
He had no role in the
internal review that brought that figure down to
He did, however, then
produce an expert report for this case valuing the subject land at $425,000.
The expert report does not give
any clue as to how Mr Wilson’s opinion
changed from the $450,000 to the $425,000 figure.
[52] When asked

market was looking at it.
[53] His report
explains his overall analysis and concludes:
The subject property is
considered to have an unimproved value higher than $375,000 (adjusted Sale 3)
and slightly less than $445,000
(the original analysed value of Sale 1).
Mr Wilson’s sale 1
property at Peters Road, Mareeba sold on 7 April 2022 for $495,000. At 118.57
hectares it is larger than the subject property.
[55] Mr Wilson
analysed the unimproved value at $480,000, concluding it was superior to the
subject land.
[56] Mr Stewart
argued the sale was not comparable because there was an indication that the
purchaser was not interested in the land
for rural lifestyle purposes, but
rather for development. There was mention of a boot camp for young offenders or
if that idea failed,
subdivision.
The evidence about
the purchaser’s motives and plans for future use of the land is not clear
enough to reach a conclusion
[57] The land is
comparable, but it is superior to the subject land on size and proximity to
Mareeba. Mr Wilson thought that “[b]eing
in a similar location both the
sale and the subject property experience a level of waterlogging during periods
of heavy rain”.
[58] I agree
that being close to the subject land, the sale property likely experiences very
similar rainfall. Whether it has similar
drainage problems or waterlogging is
[59] A component
of Mr Wilson’s analysis of sale 1 is a $35,000 adjustment to account for
that land not having an electricity
connection. Mr Wilson obtained a quote for
a solar system with battery storage – at
Mr Wilson wrote that
it “is difficult to estimate the cost to extend electricity to the sale
parcel” from existing electrical
infrastructure 800 metres
The evidence does not
reveal the comparative costs. Mr Wilson was right to adjust for the electricity
connection and his use of
the quote for the solar system is a satisfactory
general estimate.
conclusion about sale 1 is that it is markedly superior to the subject land. It
is larger, closer to Mareeba, and it has
superior water availability. As
negatives, it has no electricity connection and has less cleared area. I do not
think that the
lesser cleared area is a significant factor in comparing rural
lifestyle blocks.
[61] The land
sold only two weeks prior to the date of valuation and is only 7 kilometres from
the subject land. It is the most helpful
sale. The subject land should be
appreciably lower in value to account for its smaller size and waterlogging
Mr Wilson’s sale 2 and sale 4
[62] 37 Oaky
Valley Avenue, Mutchilba sold on 20 May 2021 for $250,000. It is very nearly
the same size as the subject property,
at 80.57 hectares.
[63] It sold
again on 5 September 2022 for $320,000.
[64] Those two
transactions are Mr Wilson’s sales 2 and 4. He analysed the two sales at
unimproved values of $235,000 and $284,000.
[65] Mr Wilson
assessed this property as being far inferior/markedly inferior to the subject
property based on location and topography.
[66] The land is
53 kilometres away from the subject land. It is nearer to Atherton than it is
to Mareeba.
[67] The land is
an unusual, inconvenient shape. It has different topography.
[68] The only
comparable feature is size. Given the shape and topography, however, the
similarity in size is not as comparable as
[69] Mr Wilson
did not clearly articulate why the land increased in value by 28 percent in less
than one year.
[70] He was
challenged in cross-examination about the distance that the property was from
the subject site. It was suggested to him
that the property was in a different
postcode and that the area it was in may have experienced a movement in market
value that was
not directly translatable to the subject land. Mr Wilson
[71] My view is
that Mr Wilson under-accounted for the difference in locations. That the sale
land is near Atherton and the subject
land is near Mareeba reveals they are not
easily comparable. The increase in value of sale 2 and 4 is too small a sample
extrapolate a uniform increase in value across the Tablelands of 28
percent in less than one year. My view is that it is more likely
that different
areas/localities increased by different amounts.
Wilson’s sale 3
[72] 1028 Bilwon
Road, Biboohra sold on 6 May 2021 for $370,000. It is only 30.3 hectares.
[73] Mr Wilson
analysed this sale to a value of $315,000, because of improvements and because
it has a five megalitre water allocation
from the Barron River. On the basis of
the increase in price for sales 2 and 4, he then analysed the sale back up to an
unimproved value of $375,000.
concluded it was far inferior to the subject land.
substantial band across the middle of the sale property is marked as being
within the Extreme Flood Hazard level on the flood
hazard overlay map in the
planning scheme. Mr Wilson notes that marker is “considered a negative
characteristic in the marketplace
potentially impacting the cost or ability to
insure improvements on the
I accept that
[76] The sale
property is certainly much smaller than the subject land. Once the water
allocation is taken into account, the analysed
figure of $315,000 makes sense.
[77] For the
reasons set out above, I do not accept Mr Wilson’s approach of analysing
that $315,000 up to $375,000 because of
the increase in the value of sales 2 and
4. The land may have increased in value somewhat, but the evidence does not
support a direct
application of that 28 percent increase to land about 50
kilometres away.
[78] Sale 3 is
(according to the planning scheme map),
there is no information about its
susceptibility to waterlogging. Mr Stewart pointed out that the subject land is
not affected by
floodwater or water from a river – the
“waterlogging” issue is a problem of rainwater not draining
They are different water
issues. In any case, both sale 3 and the subject property are negatively
affected by a water related issue.
[79] Sale 3 sets
a useful floor for the analysis of the subject land – that is, the subject
land cannot be too close to that
figure because despite the similarities, the
sale land is less than half the size of the subject land. The $315,000, or
more to account for some increase in the market between 6 May 2021 and
April 2022, is a useful benchmark for assessing the value
of the subject land.
Whether the assessment should be generous to the
Department submits that there is no scope to adopt a generous approach towards
the landowner, such as might be taken in a
compulsory acquisition case. It

for the proposition that this appeal is more akin to a revenue case than a
compensation case. The consequence is said to be that
doubts are not to be
resolved in favour of a more liberal estimate, but rather a more conservative
unnecessary to determine the point as I have not adopted an approach of giving
Mrs Stewart the benefit of a more liberal
estimate. Instead, the value of the
land has been derived from an analysis of the sales evidence, absent any need to
factor in a
liberal or conservative approach.
Conclusions
[82] If the two
step test in
Tennyson Reach
applies, I conclude that the evidence in its
totality supports the argument put by Mrs Stewart that the issued valuation is
That is because the sales evidence, properly analysed, does not
support the figure of $425,000.
[83] The basis
of that conclusion is that Mr Wilson did not properly account for the
disadvantages of the subject property, particularly
waterlogging.
[84] Mr Wilson
attempted, in good faith, to assist the Court. That said, I found components of
his evidence unclear. His method
yielded some imprecise or anomalous
(a) his analysis appeared not to properly bring to account the larger size of
This can be compared
with sale 3, which was more than 50 hectares smaller than the subject property
– a factor which was apparently
brought to account in his assessment that
the land was ‘far inferior’ to the subject because it did not
contain the same
minimising qualification as sale
(b) his report noted the area of each of the sales that was cleared of
vegetation (and in some instances commented on the possibility
clearing), but he gave oral evidence that whether clearing was an improvement or
not was subjective.
had no regard to the clearing on the subject
(c) it was unclear how he compared the subject land to the sale properties with
respect to water supply. He told the Court that
he had not looked into what it
would cost Mrs Stewart to get a water supply on the subject property from the
Barron River;
(d) using the same land twice out of four sales was unusual. 37 Oaky Valley
Avenue, Mutchilba is not very comparable to the subject
and is not helpful.
That that one parcel of land constituted 50 percent of Mr Wilson’s sales
evidence, gives a distorted appearance
of there being more helpful evidence to
use to value the subject land than there actually is.
[85] As to the
second step of
Tennyson Reach
, it is the Court’s role to synthesise
the evidence to reach a value for the subject land.
[86] My view is
that Mr Wilson’s valuation of $425,000 is too high because it did not
properly account for waterlogging. He
told the Court that he had not attributed
a dollar value to the waterlogging problem, but had instead used sales that are
to waterlogging.
the other sales are subject to waterlogging, and to what extent, is
I do not consider that
Mr Wilson’s approach adequately brought this negative attribute of the
subject land to account.
[87] As stated
above, the value of the subject land ought to be appreciably lower than sale 1.
The discount cannot be too great, however,
as it is appropriate to preserve some
proportionality downwards to sale 3.
[88] As for Mrs
Stewart’s figure of $340,000, I do not think that is correct because there
must be some downward proportionality
to sale 3. The $340,000 position is below
the sale price and the analysed value of sale 3. I do not agree that the
subject site
should be valued at a lesser amount than the much smaller sale 3
[89] Based on
the analysis set out above, the value of the subject land on 14 April 2022 (or
