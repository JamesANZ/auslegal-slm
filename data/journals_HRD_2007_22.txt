Freedom of Movement: The case of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
of Movement: The case of Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza
Jessica Montell
Last week I took my daughter to the doctor. It’s a 20
minute drive from my house in Jerusalem to the doctor’s office. The
entire trip took an hour: 20 minutes there, 20 minutes at
the doctor and 20
minutes back. All in all a very uneventful journey.
This experience is only remarkable in comparison to mothers in a similar
situation living just a few kilometers down the road. For
the 2.4 million
Palestinians in the West Bank, a routine trip to the doctor is a lengthy and
stressful undertaking; an urgent trip
to the doctor can turn into a real
On 12th March, Afaf Hilmiyeh went into labor. Her house in Abu Dis is just a
few metres from the Makassed hospital in Jerusalem. In
between, however, is an
eight-metre high wall, part of the Separation Barrier that Israel is
constructing in and along the West Bank.
For days Afaf’s mother had tried to get the permit that would enable
Afaf to enter Jerusalem. On the day Afaf went into labor,
her mother was
standing in line with Afaf’s ID card at the Za’ayem checkpoint. Her
mother-in-law, Na’ama ordered
a taxi and took Afaf to the nearest gate in
the Barrier. Because they did not have the necessary permits, the policemen
let them through:
‘I begged them and finally after ten minutes one of the policemen allowed
Afaf to go in by herself’, Na’ama told
B’Tselem. ‘Afaf
was scared of going alone, but the policemen would under no circumstance allow
me to accompany her’.
So Afaf and Na’ama took the taxi to the
Za’ayem checkpoint. There Na’ama argued with the soldiers for half
and all the while Afaf’s contractions grew stronger:
Half an hour later, two officers came to see what the problem was. They led us
into a big hall, and I saw Afaf’s mother waiting
on line for the permit.
When she saw us she started screaming at the soldiers, ‘[h]ere is my
daughter who is about to give
birth and all morning you are accusing me of being
Afaf’s contractions grew so much stronger that the officers took the three
of us out of the hall and into an empty corridor.
The minute we got there, Afaf
started screaming that the baby’s head was coming out. I had her lie on
the ground, I put my
purse under her head, I took off her underwear, and then
the baby came into the world while Afaf was screaming. The soldiers gathered
around us and looked in astonishment. I yelled at them to move… We waited
for 45 minutes until an Israeli ambulance came. One
of the paramedics cut the
umbilical cord and gave Afaf a shot. At that minute, one of the soldiers came
with a permit for Afaf and
her mother and they went to al-Makassed hospital. The
soldiers allowed me to accompany them even though I had no permit.
Over the past 17 years, Israel has gradually increased
restrictions on Palestinian movement. Prior to 1991, Palestinians could travel
easily between the West Bank, Israel and Gaza. Only in rare cases was an
individual Palestinian prevented for security reasons from
entering or crossing
through Israel. Today the opposite is the case: the entire Palestinian
population is prevented from entering
or crossing through Israel. It is the rare
exception when a Palestinian receives the necessary permit to do so.
It is hard to overstate the importance of freedom of movement as a basic
right. Indeed the enjoyment of many other rights –
and sometimes even the
right to life itself – depends on free movement. Thus, Israel’s
restrictions on Palestinian movement
have far-reaching implications on the
enjoyment of virtually all economic and social rights.
Israel has subdivided the West Bank into six different sections. Eighty three
fixed checkpoints, 471 physical roadblocks and the Separation
Barrier restrict
movement from one section to the other. Palestinians require special permits to
enter the Jordan Valley, East Jerusalem
and the enclaves created by the
Separation Barrier. In addition, Palestinian vehicles are prohibited from
traveling on 312 kilometres
of main roads in the West Bank as these roads serve
Israeli settlers only.
These restrictions have disrupted Palestinian commerce, obstructed access to
medical care, imposed hardships on university students
and faculty, and
restricted social and familial ties. Simple actions such as going to work in a
nearby town, marketing farm produce,
obtaining medical treatment and visiting
relatives can entail lengthy bureaucratic procedures to obtain the necessary
permit. Even
when permits are not necessary, Palestinians may have to stop at
several checkpoints and complete part of the journey on foot.
Baslan Al-Fares owned a small amusement park in Badhan village, just three
kilometres from the city of Nablus. ‘People from
across the West Bank as
well as Arabs from Israel would come to our park and the profits were
good’, he told B’Tselem:
We worked between March and September and our income was about 300,000 NIS. We
lived a dignified life on this income for the entire
year. With the outbreak of
the second Intifada [in September 2001] the situation changed. The Israeli army
closed the main road that
connected Al-Badhan to Nablus and placed four big
mounds of dirt on it. Residents of Nablus have not been able to come to the town
by car since then. Initially, it was possible to cross on foot. The soldiers
stood next to the dirt mounds and checked the ID cards
and belongings. But after
a few months, the army even prohibited passage by foot. Now we can only get to
Nablus on dirt roads that
twist and bend for 15 kilometers. These roads are
damaged and full of potholes. The travel is very expensive, very time consuming,
and very hard, especially during the winter months when it’s rainy and
Because of the difficulties in reaching Al-Badhan, people
stopped coming to the park and we were forced to close it. Today, we no
have a business. I have searched for another job but have not found one. My
brothers who work in the Gulf states send me money
so I can support my family. I
feel that I am a burden on them and it pains me very much, but I don’t
know what else I can do.
In addition to the quantifiable effects of these restrictions on economy and
health, there are also less tangible effects. How to
measure, for example, the
loss of an amusement park for Palestinian children? Or the emotional burden when
every journey is fraught
with uncertainty, and entails unnecessary investment of
time and money?
In the Gaza Strip, the situation is even more dire. This tiny territory is
virtually locked down. Movement has been severelly restricted
for the past seven
years, but since Hamas’ military take-over in June, almost none of the 1.4
million residents can get in
or out of Gaza. Even the seriously ill in need of
medical treatment unavailable in Gaza face innumerable obstacles to reach
in East Jerusalem, Israel or abroad. Between July and September 2007,
Physicians for Human Rights-Israel (PHR) received 138 appeals
from Gazans whose
request for access to medical care was rejected by the Israeli authorities. As a
result of legal and public intervention,
PHR obtained exit permits for 52 of
them. It appears that the situation has even further deteriorated after the
Israeli Cabinet decision
in October to declare Gaza a ‘hostile
The tiny Gaza economy is completely dependent on imports of raw materials and
various foodstuffs, and exports of agriculture and other
products. Since June
virtually all exports have been halted and Gaza tomatoes and strawberries rot at
the border crossing. Imports
have also been severely curtailed, with Israel only
allowing passage of the most essential goods, like medicines and bags of flour.
As a result, the previously struggling Gaza economy has suffered a mortal blow.
Some 75% of Gaza’s factories have shut down.
Even before the
recent deterioration, 87% of Gazans lived below the poverty line, with over 80%
dependent on food aid from the international
Israel’s justification for all of its restrictions is that they are
necessary for security. Indeed, Israel faces serious security
concerns. In the
past seven years, over 700 Israeli civilians have been killed in indiscriminate
attacks by Palestinian militants.
On a regular basis, Palestinians
fire rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israeli communities. Israel is entitled to
protect itself
by employing various measures, including the imposition of
restrictions on movement. However, the breadth and duration of the restrictions
it has imposed and the resulting grave harm that this policy has caused to the
Palestinian civilian population constitute a flagrant
breach of its legal
obligations.
In some cases, security concerns camouflage other motivations. While the
Israeli Cabinet approved construction of the Separation Barrier
Palestinians from entering Israel, the actual route chosen for the Barrier - 80%
of which lies within the West Bank rather
than on the border with Israeli
– is dictated by the desire to perpetuate and expand Israeli
settlements.
For over a decade B’Tselem has documented Israel’s restrictions
on Palestinian movement. B’Tselem has also worked
accountability, both vis a vis the individual soldier who prevents a pregnant
woman from reaching the hospital, for example,
and towards the policymakers who
formulate these illegal policies. Yet accountability does not stop at
Israel’s borders; it
must extend to the international community as well.
Europe and the United States are particularly involved in this context,
whether in their diplomatic efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian
in bi-lateral relations with Israel or in the provision of humanitarian
assistance to Palestinians. This involvement also
carries with it legal
obligations to respect and ensure human rights. Take the example of the Gaza
Strip, where Israeli policies,
some of them illegal, have created a humanitarian
crisis. Israel has a responsibility for the welfare of the civilian population
and must remedy any wrongs it has committed. Yet in fact, it is Europe (in its
funding of various humanitarian agencies) that is
currently ensuring the welfare
of the population. While European generosity is commendable, aid without
accountability only makes
the Palestinians poorer and more dependent.
Israelis and Palestinians all have the basic right to live in safety and
dignity. The international community has a crucial role to
play in ensuring that
these rights are respected.
