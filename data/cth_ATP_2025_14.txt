INTRODUCTION
Panel, Chelsey Drake, Susan Forrester and Sarah Rennie (sitting President),
declined to conduct proceedings on an application
by Mr Bob Ciesla in relation
to the affairs of FBR Limited. The application raised concerns over the lack of
disclosure and the
effects on control in relation to a two-tranche institutional
placement undertaken by FBR. The Panel considered that there was no
prospect that it would declare the circumstances unacceptable and the Applicant
had not provided a sufficient body of
material to justify the Panel making
further enquiries.
these reasons, the following definitions

The extraordinary general meeting referred to in paragraph
Fidelity International Limited
The placement referred to in paragraph
Placement Shares
The ordinary shares issued by FBR under the Placement
Resolutions
The resolutions passed at the EGM as referred to in paragraph
is an ASX-listed company that designs, develops and builds dynamically
stabilised robots to work outdoors (ASX: FBR).
27 March 2025, FBR announced that it had completed a $6.3 million two-tranche
placement at an issue price of $0.01 per share to
provide additional working
capital and for restructuring and development costs (
first tranche of the Placement (574,500,000 shares) was issued to sophisticated
and professional investors under FBR’s
existing placement capacity. The
second tranche of the Placement (53,800,000 shares) was to be issued to FIL
subject to shareholder
6 May 2025, FBR held a shareholders’ meeting (
resolutions to approve the second tranche of the Placement, ratify the first
tranche of the Placement and ratify another previous
issue of 149,073,026 shares
to Bell Potter (under a share purchase plan announced on 29 November 2024) were
each carried (
Resolutions
to this application, the Applicant had previously lodged an application to the
Takeovers Panel dated 4 May 2025 in relation
to the affairs of FBR but
subsequently withdrew the application with the intention of submitting a fresh
application.
APPLICATION
Declaration sought
application dated 18 May 2025, the Applicant sought a declaration of
unacceptable circumstances. The Applicant submitted that
(among other things):
(a) The Placement approved at the EGM ‘
consolidated control in
institutional hands without triggering protections in Chapter 6 of the
Corporations Act
and that this outcome was facilitated by a
procedurally deficient voting process that excluded and confused
retail shareholders
’ through inadequate disclosure and unclear meeting
materials. It was contended that the structure of the placement enabled
institutional investors, such as FIL, to significantly increase their voting
power in the company.
(b) FBR made ‘
improper use of ASX Listing
to bypass a broader
vote and issue discounted shares to select institutions, contrary to the spirit
of shareholder equity’
and that FBR’s reliance on its placement
capacity circumvented proper shareholder scrutiny and disadvantaged retail
shareholders,
who were excluded from participating in the Placement on the same
(c) The FBR board ‘
refused to engage with shareholders who requested
postponement and clarification’
in relation to the EGM, noting that
several shareholders had sought to delay the meeting and requested further
information on the
proposed Resolutions but that those concerns were not
adequately addressed by the FBR board prior to the vote at the EGM.
risk of FBR’s intellectual property being transferred
offshore and exploited by insiders [had] materially increased’
result of the Placement and its effect on control.
Final orders
Applicant sought final orders including to the following effect:
(a) The outcomes of the EGM be set aside and the company be required to convene
a new meeting with ‘
proper notice, revised explanatory materials and
[an opportunity for shareholder] questions’.
(b) FBR be required to make disclosures regarding intellectual property
ownership and any alternative financing options considered
by the board.
made preliminary submissions, submitting that (among other things):
(a) FBR had an urgent need for capital and the directors considered that a
private placement was the best means of raising capital
because it would be
completed over a shorter period of time and ‘
offer[ed] certainty as to
the level of participation and the amount of funds raised’
(b) The Notice of Meeting for the EGM complied with the relevant requirements of
Corporations Act 2001
(Cth) and ASX Listing Rules. The Notice of
Meeting was approved by ASX prior to being dispatched and sent to FBR
shareholders in
accordance with section 249J.
(c) The Placement and the associated passing of the Resolutions had no effect on
control in relation to FBR because no shareholder,
as a result of the Placement,
increased their holding beyond the 20% threshold prohibited by section 606.
Furthermore, no shareholder
acquired a substantial interest in the company or
obtained a position of influence sufficient to determine the outcome of
of section 50AA.
(d) There was no improper use by FBR of ASX Listing Rule 7.1. The Placement
Shares were issued under the company’s available
capacity in accordance
with the ASX Listing Rules. Shareholder approval was sought at the EGM to
ratify the share issues and refresh
the company’s placement capacity.
(e) The price of the Placement Shares was determined in consultation with Bell
Potter, having regard to prevailing market conditions
and the demand from
institutional and sophisticated investors at the time of the Placement.
further submitted that in relation to persons who were substantial shareholders
of FBR prior to the Placement:
(a) three of its four substantial shareholders provided a Form 604 –
Notice of change of interest of substantial holder following
the Placement
disclosing a decrease in voting power of more than 1% and
(b) its other substantial shareholder, FIL, did not lodge an updated Form 604
which it would have been required to do if there had
been a movement of at least
1% in its holding in FBR. FBR noted that the shares issued to FIL under the
Placement represented 0.946%
of the total shares on issue following the
Placement and that the last Form 604 lodged by FIL (dated 16 December 2019)
stated that
FIL had voting power of 9.9% in FBR.
potential control of, or the acquisition or proposed
acquisition of a
substantial interest in, a company.
The Placement appeared to have been conducted in compliance with the ASX Listing
Rules and made within FBR’s existing capacity
under ASX Listing Rule 7.1.
There was no evidence to suggest the Placement had any effect on control of, or
the acquisition of a
substantial interest in,
. There was also no material to
indicate that the Placement was inconsistent with the purposes of Chapter
issues raised in the application relating to corporate governance and
operational decision-making, including in relation to the
management or
ownership of intellectual property and the risk of offshore transfer are not
matters for us unless such issues are
connected to a control transaction or the
acquisition of a substantial interest or are inconsistent with the principles in
Placement formed part of a broader capital management strategy in response to
FBR’s financial constraints and was undertaken
through a process that
complied with the ASX Listing Rules and
Corporations Act 2001
Placement reflected a conventional capital raising of the kind commonly
conducted by ASX-listed entities. The proportion
of shares issued and the
procedural steps followed for the capital raising were consistent with market
are not satisfied that there was any evidence to suggest that the Placement
conferred a control benefit on any particular shareholder,
nor that it was
structured to avoid shareholder approval or entrench the voting powers of a
particular group of shareholders.
Applicant did not clearly articulate the basis on which he alleged that the
circumstances were unacceptable. While broad concerns
were raised in relation
to the Placement, explanatory materials, lack of shareholder engagement and
management decisions more generally,
the application did not sufficiently
explain how those matters amounted to unacceptable circumstances within the
section 657A.
acknowledge that while shareholders with standing are entitled to bring
applications, prospective applicants should consider whether
the circumstances
genuinely raise issues within our jurisdiction. Our powers are designed to
address unacceptable circumstances
that undermine the principles set out in
section 602
, particularly in the context of control transactions. Where matters
relate to routine placements or capital raisings that fall within
market norms,
prospective applicants need to assess carefully whether there is a reasonable
basis to warrant our intervention. We
encourage potential applicants to obtain
independent legal advice prior to lodging an application, particularly where the
circumstances
do not clearly disclose matters falling within our jurisdiction.
the reasons above, we do not consider that there is any reasonable prospect that
we would make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances.
Accordingly, we have
decided not to conduct proceedings in relation to the application under
regulation 20
Australian Securities and Investments Commission
Regulations 2001
(Cth). Given that we have decided not to conduct
proceedings, we do not (and do not need to) consider whether to make any interim
or final orders.
