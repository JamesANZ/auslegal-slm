REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
ALDRIDGE J:
parties entered into an agreement on 15 February 2013 dealing with the
division of their property. The respondent contends that
it is a binding
financial agreement within the meaning of
Family Law Act
(Cth) (“the Act”). The applicant’s case is that it is
not and that he is able to pursue proceedings under
of the Act. This
is because the agreement does not deal with property division after the
breakdown of the marriage or with maintenance,
and therefore is not an agreement
of the Act.

parties were married in 1982. They have four children, born in 1985, 1987, 1993
parties bought a property in Suburb C in 1984. It was sold in 1991 and a

section 90C
Family Law Act 1975

their maintenance under section 90E of the Act
to take effect immediately.

resources of the parties now and their maintenance

Paragraph 4
of the operative provisions refers to future contributions and the possibility
of changes in circumstances.
Paragraph 5
provided for:
The immediate
subdivision and sale of the Suburb E property with the respondent to receive
70 per cent of the net proceeds and the
30 per cent;
The respondent
to immediately relinquish any interest in a named company; and
The parties to

respondent was the sole registered proprietor of the Suburb D property and it
was identified in an annexure to the agreement as
her separate property.
agreement does not refer to either the breakdown of marriage or to
maintenance.
Section 90C
of the Act deals with financial agreements made during marriage.
Section 90G
identifies when such agreements become binding which ousts the jurisdiction of
the Court under s 79. To be binding under
this section, the agreement must
first be a “financial agreement”.
s 90C, an agreement is a “financial agreement” if it meets the
requirements of s 90C(1)(a), (aa) and (b). The first
subsections requires the agreement to be “with respect to any of the
matters mentioned in subsection (2)”.
90C(2) provides:
(2) The matters referred to in paragraph (1)(a) are the following:
(a) how, in the event of the breakdown of the marriage, all or any of the
property or financial resources of either or both of the
spouse parties at the
time when the agreement is made, or at a later time and during the marriage, is
to be dealt with;
(b) the maintenance of either of the spouse parties:
(i) during the marriage; or
(ii) after divorce; or
(iii) both during the marriage and after
present agreement does not provide for division of property in the event of a
breakdown of the marriage or for maintenance. Rather
it provides only for the
immediate sale of one property and the retention of others. It is therefore not
a financial agreement for
the purposes of s 90C or Pt VIIIA.

, especially at [46]–[51].

meaning of s 90C and the matter will be listed
for directions to prosecute
the s 79 claim.
