The dilemma of now
The ‘invisible’ youth homelessness crisis
By Rebecca Reynolds*
It is true to say that the changes the federal Government is talking about
in relation to the way homelessness is dealt with—at
a state and federal
level—are a ‘once in a generation’ opportunity.
Government information talks about proactive and extensive ways to make
meaningful social changes that actually address the problems
of homelessness in
Australia. We have both federal and state governments that say they are willing
to work together; a national consultation
process that promises to overhaul
that lead to it; and the money to support the
policy. Government housing reforms promise new homes and extensive renovations
community housing stock and, since the initial announcements, an
extensive process of acquisition and revitalisation has been undertaken.
the acquisition is of land on which to build new stock—which takes
time—and most of the revitalisation requires,
logically, that tenants be
moved out of their current accommodation for renovations to occur.
But what do we do while these things are happening? Do we just ask the young
person accessing the youth support service Twenty10,
who is in need of housing,
to ‘hold out’ until building is complete and renovations are
finished? I doubt any policy
makers or community workers would suggest that this
is appropriate. But it is really hard to quantify youth homelessness for those
in government who are in a position to make accommodation more immediately
available for the young people we see at Twenty10 on a
daily basis. Traditional
data collection mechanisms tend to make young people invisible to the system as
it is difficult to describe
what homelessness looks like for young folk in
Difficult to describe because when I think about what youth homelessness
looks like, the picture is something that is more easy for
us all to relate to
than the idea of sleeping rough on the street. Homelessness looks like a night
on a friend’s couch, or
staying out all night dancing. It looks like
turning that night out at the pub into an all night tryst or walking the streets
night and sleeping through the day. While many of us have been there at some
point, the big difference is that we usually have been
there by choice. We have
an alternative.
Young people experiencing homelessness in 2009 are forced into these
situations night after night, just so they can have somewhere
to rest or some
way to kill time.
And then there are those who have secured themselves a room in some form of
boarding or shared accommodation—a room that is
often shared with others.
Take Tami, for example. Tami is a young person who Twenty10 was helping to sort
out identification. Tami
had been thrown out of home when he told his parents
that he was gay. He was unable to communicate with his parents or access the
family home, and was having difficulty getting his birth certificate to prove
his identity. Think about how many times you need to
prove who you are to get
things done! Enrolling for courses, signing leases, negotiating with Centrelink
and public housing authorities
... the list continues. But with the support of
his case manager and after many conversations with the Roads and Traffic
the final step in getting an identity card sorted was a piece of mail
with Tami’s current address on it. The mail itself was
problem—the problem was Tami being able to get into the boarding house
bedroom where the mail was located, as the room
was being rented by another
person at the time. There is really nothing worse than not knowing what you are
walking into—but
that is Tami’s daily reality.
Visibility problems
Our homeless young people are invisible to most of our community. You
probably would not think twice if you walked past them on the
street, saw them
sleeping in the sunshine in the local park or bought them a drink in a bar. It
is with this in mind that, as the
Government starts talking about introducing
specific homelessness legislation, we strongly encourage the retention of a
broad definition
of homelessness. If only those who are roofless are counted in
to solutions
and policies that only tackle a small percentage of the problem.
While the government has, metaphorically, aligned the planets to attempt to
shift the fundamental circumstances that lead to homelessness,
different collection of circumstances at work that are impacting on the young
people who are accessing Twenty10 and other
youth accommodation and crisis
services across Australia. As services and workers, we are encouraging and
supporting a systemically
invisible group of people to become visible and ask
for the assistance that they are entitled to—only to not be able to
them with any sustainable solutions. There is an inadequate supply of
community and government housing stock and a private rental
market that is
applying an ever increasing amount of financial pressure to renters.
Hence, our dilemma at Twenty10. While improvements are on the way and broad
based issues are being tackled, ours is the dilemma of
what do we do right now?
What do we do tonight? Next week? Next month? Backpackers’ hostels and
boarding houses are a short-term
solution but it is an impossible ask for a
young person or a service to continue to pay for these services on a daily
and if they are available. There are also significant concerns
around the standards of many facilities that provide temporary accommodation.
Additionally, in being forced to use these services, young people of diverse
genders and sexualities are often being placed at an
even greater risk of
homophobic violence, intimidation and discrimination. These young people are at
greater risk of being fired
from tenuous employment situations (where the least
experienced is often the first to go); of being unable to maintain a school
of not being able to prepare or store food; of not being able to wash
and dry clothes ... the list goes on. Governments (at all levels)
communities need to step up and speed up the efforts to find a solution to this
problem—a solution that is effective
today and into the future.
Our homeless young people are clever and resilient. They take what the world
throws at them and find a way to make it work. They set
a strong example for
governments and services to emulate. I wonder if we are as ready and able to
deal with the challenges that are
there for us to tackle.
