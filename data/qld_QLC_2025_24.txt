CATCHWORDS:
PROCEDURE – CIVIL PROCEEDINGS IN STATE AND TERRITORY COURTS –
COSTS – GENERAL RULE: COSTS FOLLOW EVENT – where
previously held that the applicant did not have a right to claim compensation in
compensation proceedings – where
both parties claim they were successful
in that proceeding – whether the applicant was substantially successful at
whether there are discretionary factors that warrant a different
order than that costs should follow the event
Acquisition of Land Act 1967
APPEARANCES:
DR Gore KC and DA Quayle (instructed by Anderssen Lawyers) for the
RJ Anderson KC and JS Brien (instructed by Ashurst) for the
first respondent
[1] On 15 August
2025, I determined that Philip Usher Constructions (PUC) did not have a right to
claim compensation in its own right
because of the compulsory acquisition of
land owned by a third party at the time of
acquisition.
[2] Both parties
now claim their costs of the proceeding because they both say that they were
substantially successful. Obviously,
only one of them is correct.
[3] If PUC was
simply seeking an order that it ‘took up’ the rights of Ring, and
the Authority resisted that approach,
then I agree that PUC was wholly
successful in the proceeding.
Authority conceded that PUC was entitled to an assignment of the fruits of
Ring’s right to compensation.
That concession is reflected in the terms of paragraph 1 of my decision.
Authority conceded that PUC was entitled to an assignment of the fruits of
Ring’s right to compensation.
That concession is reflected in the terms of paragraph 1 of my decision.
[6] That was
not, however, the thrust of PUC’s argument. Although PUC submitted that
all it was seeking was an assignment of
Ring’s rights, in fact it argued
that the deed of assignment created a separate interest in land that was capable
of supporting
a claim or compensation. Although never specifically stated, and
only tangentially referred to in the material:
(a) PUC's claim was always based on what it could do with the resumed land, not
what Ring may have proposed.
(b) PUC’s claim for compensation was in its own right and not tied to any
right Ring had.
(c) PUC was aware of the competing interpretation of the
Acquisition of Land
which I ultimately
accepted, but persisted in its claim.
[7] PUC was not
successful – it did not get the result it wanted. That fact alone favours
an order for PUC to pay the Authority’s
costs. As the Authority has
submitted and I accept, there are no discretionary factors that warrant a
different order.
Philip Usher Constructions Pty Ltd is to pay the Cross River Rail Delivery
Authority’s costs of, and incidental to the application,
as agreed or
assessed on the standard basis.
