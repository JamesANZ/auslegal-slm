Review: Bede Harris,
Constitutional Reform as a Remedy
for Political Disenchantment in Australia
Bruce Baer Arnold and Damon Smith*
Bede Harris’
Constitutional Reform as a Remedy for Political
Disenchantment in Australia
(Springer, 2020), a monograph by one of the
nation’s most incisive and thoughtful constitutional law scholars, builds
on exemplary
work such as his 2002
Constitution
It is particularly timely given statements by politicians about peers as we
head into the 2022 national election (departing MPs damning
the Prime Minister
as a manipulative bully who lacks a moral
propagation by
legislators of fake health news about COVID quackery such as worm
criticisms by courts of
executive accountability,
incidents at Old Parliament House by sovereign citizens and adherents of
anti-vax conspiracism, sectional
resentment,
ongoing disregard by
the Government of calls for establishment of a national integrity
commission,
and the superficiality
of ‘Open Government’ initiatives at the national, state/territory
and local government levels,
reflected in international corruption barometers
and in the frequent deployment by state and Commonwealth departments of Freedom
of Information legislation as a weapon to deter transparency, rather than a
supplementary tool in support of a default position of
release of government
information.
It is also timely given independent authoritative studies such as the
Australian National University (ANU) 2019
Australian Election Study
which reported satisfaction with democracy is at its lowest level since the
1970s constitutional crisis, with trust in government
having reached its lowest
level on record.
The ANU data indicates that less than 26% of Australians believe people in
government can be trusted, with 56% believing government
is run for ‘a few
big interests’ and only 12% believing the government is run for ‘all
the people’. That
disquiet is increasing, with for example a 27% decline
since 2007 in stated satisfaction with how Australia’s democracy is
working. Overall trust in government has declined by nearly 20% since 2007;
three quarters believe that people in government are
looking after themselves.
That belief may be misplaced but given reports of administrative incompetence or
corruption, influence
buying, ministerial obfuscation and egregious misogyny or
ministerial frolics with rent boys in the Parliament House prayer room
unsurprising.
Harris’ book combines deep analysis regarding questions about
legitimacy, insights regarding the conceptual basis and operation
structures, and an exceptional engagement with a succession of incidents that
erode public trust regarding both public administration
politics as usual’. As a nuanced exploration of Australian disillusionment
with the conduct of politics the
book argues much is ultimately traceable to
defects in the constitution, with improvement of government requiring
constitutional
Constitutional Reform
argues that the dominant approach to
constitutional debate is flawed because anti-theoretical, ungrounded in coherent
stymied by the traditional preoccupation with practical objections to
reform ahead (and instead) of considering the principled case
for change. Harris
offers a persuasive suggestion that instead of accepting the national
Constitution
‘as is’, we can use human dignity as the fundamental
value upon which a constitution should be based and thence begin
discussion of Australia’s Constitution ought to be.
The book is a commendably brave effort, worthy of respect irrespective of a
reader’s adherence or non-adherence to academic
orthodoxies. It makes the
case for change in key areas. They include –
• reform of the electoral system,
• enhanced parliamentary scrutiny of the executive,
• inclusion in the constitution of a full Bill of Rights,
• abolition of the federal system,
• realisation of the rights of Indigenous people,
• codification of constitutional conventions, whether in conjunction
with or separate from establishment of an Australian republic
as an extension of
the belated patriation evident in for example the Australia
• reform of the rules of standing in constitutional matters
• the need to improve civics education.
The book includes a draft new constitution, drawing on research over the past
two decades.
One conclusion for readers is that citizens, underpinned and perhaps inspired
by the civics education highlighted by Dr Harris, have
responsibilities. As this
issue of Canberra Law Review headed to press Dr Catherine Williams (Director of
Research at the Centre
for Public Integrity) analysed the 2022 national Budget
funding announcements for key accountability institutions, placing them within
the context of real funding across the past 10
She noted that the 2022-2023 budget includes
• insufficient funding of $67 million over 4 years for a Commonwealth
Integrity Commission (as yet not established),
• a 17.67% cut in real terms to the funding for the ABC compared to
2012 levels,
• a 9.12% cut in real terms to funding the Australian National Audit
Office, and
• year on year cuts to the Ombudsman, Australian Law Reform Commission,
Australian Human Rights Commission and the Administrative
Appeals Tribunal.
The 2022 national election is a reminder that citizens who
do have scope to influence policy choices and – consistent with
Harris’ insights regarding civics education –
should exercise their
responsibilities through voting..

Cause for disquiet is not
restricted to the national sphere, reflected for example in resignation of three
South Australian ministers
and the state's Legislative Council President over
expenses, reporting by LNP MPs regarding their leader Deb Freckleton and
condemnation
of the then NSW Premier for an undisclosed relationship with an MP
who has been characterised as a ‘bagman’.
