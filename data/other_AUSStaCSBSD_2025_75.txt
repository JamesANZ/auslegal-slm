Telecommunications
Legislation Amendment (Triple Zero Custodian and Emergency Calling Powers) Bill
This bill seeks to implement recommendations of the 2023 Bean Review,
including to establish a Triple Zero Custodian to coordinate
management and
oversight of the Triple Zero emergency call ecosystem. The bill would also
strengthen the Australian Communications
and Media Authority’s ability to
direct carriers, carriage service providers and emergency call persons to
provide certain
information or take certain action regarding the effective
functioning of emergency call services.

1.317 The bill seeks to implement Recommendation 2 of the
Bean Review into
the Optus Outage of 8 November 2023
during which Optus customers (and those
of Optus network resellers) were impacted by a national whole-of-network outage.
This outage
affected a range of essential government, public health and safety
infrastructure, including calls to the Triple Zero emergency call
1.318 The final report of the review, conducted by Mr Richard Bean, found
the vesting of overarching responsibility for, and visibility of, the
end-to-end functioning of the Triple Zero service in one person
or organisation
would have significantly improved information flow and recovery efforts on the
1.319 The bill accordingly seeks to amend the
Telecommunications (Consumer
Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999
(TCPSS Act) to formally establish
a Triple Zero Custodian, with responsibility for coordinating the management and
oversight of the
triple zero emergency call ecosystem (under proposed Part 8,
Division 5 of the TCPSS Act). The bill would also provide the Australian
Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) with a power under proposed Part 8,
Division 3 of the TCPSS Act to direct carriers, carriage
service providers and
emergency call persons to provide information, and take certain action,
regarding the effective functioning
of emergency call services. Proposed Part 8,
Division 4 of the TCPSS Act would create a formal use and disclosure of
information
regime to support the functions, duties, and powers of the Triple
Zero Custodian and the ACMA proposed by the bill.
1.320 Schedule 1, item 7, proposed section 151R seeks to provide that the
Minister may cause a review to be conducted into the effectiveness
of proposed
Divisions 3, 4 and 5 after two years from commencement of the proposed
1.321 The committee’s consistent scrutiny view is that tabling
documents in the Parliament is important to parliamentary scrutiny,
as it alerts
parliamentarians to the existence of documents and provides opportunities for
debate that are not available where documents
are not made public or are only
published online. As such, the committee expects there to be appropriate
justification for failing
to include tabling requirements.
1.322 In relation to the statutory review of the proposed amendments, the
explanatory memorandum states:
The Bill sets official review and reporting mechanisms on the ACMA, with
oversight from the Minister for Communications, ensuring
public accountability
for the actions and directions made by the ACMA in the performance of its
1.323 The committee notes with some concern that proposed section 151R of the
bill would not require that the review of Divisions
3, 4 and 5 of the TCPSS Act
must be tabled in the Parliament. Further, the explanatory memorandum does not
provide any further information
ministerial oversight alone should be considered to provide sufficient scrutiny
this instance.
1.324 The committee reiterates its scrutiny concern in relation to the
lack of a requirement to table the review envisaged by section
151R, but in
light of the fact that the bill has now passed both Houses of the Parliament,
the committee makes no further comment.
Parliamentary
1.325 The committee notes with concern, from a scrutiny perspective, the
speed with which this bill has passed both Houses of Parliament.
The bill was
introduced in the House of Representatives on 7 October 2025 and passed both
Houses on 28 October 2025.
1.326 The committee notes that the timeline for the passage of the bill
diminishes the ability of this committee to undertake its
usual scrutiny
process, including to engage in meaningful dialogue with the executive to
address any concerns. The committee also
notes that the standing orders of both
houses of the Parliament with respect to legislation are designed to provide
members of the
Parliament with sufficient time to consider and reconsider the
proposals contained in bills. The committee is of the view that truncated
parliamentary processes by their nature limit parliamentary scrutiny and
1.327 The committee notes with concern the speed at which this bill has
passed the Parliament. While the procedure to be followed
in the passage of
legislation is ultimately a matter for each house of the Parliament, the
committee reiterates its consistent scrutiny
view that legislation, particularly
where it may trespass on personal rights and liberties, should be subject to
thorough parliamentary
