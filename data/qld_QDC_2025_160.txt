SOLICITORS:
Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Qld.) for the appellant
Anderson Telford Lawyers for the respondent
January 2025, the respondent was convicted on his own plea of guilty in the
Magistrates Court at Townsville in relation
to one offence of driving a motor
vehicle without a driver’s licence, disqualified by a court order,
pursuant to
section 78(1)
and (3)(a) of the
Transport Operations (Road Use
Management) Act 1995
respondent was convicted, fined $1,500 and the minimum licence disqualification
period of two years was imposed. The operational
period of a suspended term of
imprisonment was extended by six months pursuant to
section 147(1)(a)
Penalties and Sentences Act 1992
appellant filed a notice to appeal on 20 February 2025. The notice listed the
following grounds of appeal:
(a) The learned Magistrate erred by failing to comply with
section 147(2)
PSA to either make an order under
section 147(1)(b)
and/or failed to state her
reasons why it would be unjust to do so in accordance with
sections 147(4)
the PSA and to give proper regard to the considerations set out in
of the PSA; and,
(b) That the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.
appellant sought leave to amend the first ground of the appeal as
(a) The learned Magistrate’s discretion miscarried in finding that it
would be unjust to order the respondent to serve the
whole of the earlier period
of imprisonment, pursuant to
section 147(2)
of the PSA.
amendment sought by the appellant is not opposed by the respondent. Leave is
granted to amend the first ground of appeal
pursuant to
section 224(1)(c)
Justices Act 1886

otherwise is opposed. The appeal was heard before me on 10 June 2025. The
factual and legal matrix that I am required
to consider is largely agreed
between the parties as set out in their respective written outlines of
submissions
[7] The crux of
the appellant’s argument is that the sentence imposed by the learned
Magistrate was lenient to the extent of
being manifestly inadequate in
circumstances where a period of imprisonment was not imposed, with the learned
Magistrate instead
preferring to impose a fine. The respondent was a mature man
with what the appellant described as an appalling traffic history.
respondent had previously been sentenced to a period of imprisonment, albeit a
wholly suspended one for a similar offence and
was in breach of that order at
the time he fell to be sentenced for the offending the subject of this
[8] The core of
the respondent’s submission is that the sentence imposed by the learned
Magistrate was lenient but not manifestly
inadequate in all of the
circumstances. The sentence imposed was within the acceptable scope of judicial
discretion when turning
to the number of competing factors or issues to balance
during the sentencing exercise. Sentences must be individualised and from
material relied on at first instance the learned Magistrate had a number of
competing factors or issues to balance during the

and when balancing all relevant considerations, I am persuaded that the sentence
imposed was manifestly inadequate.
[10] Accordingly,
I allow the appeal.
Legal Framework for the
appellant appeals pursuant to
section 222
Justices Act
[12] Pursuant to
section 223
the appeal is by way of rehearing on the original evidence, and any
new evidence adduced by leave if there are special grounds for
giving leave.
[13] The legal
principles with regard to the purpose of an appeal are well settled. The
rehearing requires this court to conduct
a real review of the evidence before it
(rather than a complete fresh hearing) and make up its own mind about the
Its function is to consider
each of the grounds of appeal having regard to the evidence and determine for
itself the facts of the
case and the legal consequences that follow from such
In doing so it ought pay
due regard to the advantage that the magistrate had in seeing the witnesses give
evidence, and attach a
good deal of weight to the magistrate’s

, the appellant can "only appeal under this
section on the sole ground that a fine, penalty, forfeiture or punishment was
or inadequate”, that is, “beyond the acceptable scope of
judicial discretion” or “so outside the appropriate
range as to
demonstrate inconsistency and
unfairness”.
To succeed, the
appellant must establish some legal, factual or discretionary

House v The King

“But the judgement complained of, namely, sentenced to a term of
imprisonment, depends upon the exercise of a judicial discretion

imposing it. The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion
should be determined is governed by established
principles. It is not enough
that the Judges composing the Appellate Court consider that if they had been in
a position of the primary
Judge they would have taken a different course. It
must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the
Judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows erroneous or irrelevant matters
to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts,
if he does not take into
account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed
and the Appellate Court may
exercise its own discretion in substitution for his
if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary Judge
has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts, it is
unreasonable or plainly unjust, the Appellate Court may
infer that in some way
there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law
reposes in the Court of first instance.
In such a case, although the nature of
the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on
that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.”

intervene is enlivened and it becomes its duty to re-sentence,

[20] When the
court considers the standard to be met on appeal, the criteria succinctly set
further assistance:
“To determine whether a sentence is excessive, it is necessary to view
it in the perspective of the maximum sentence prescribed
by law for the crime,
the standards of sentencing customarily observed with respect to the crime, the
place which the criminal conduct
occupies in the scale of seriousness of crimes
of that type, and the personal circumstances of the offender...I bear in mind
this Court should not interfere with the sentence simply because its
members would have imposed a lower sentence themselves, but
only when they are
satisfied that, having regard to all relevant factors, the sentence imposed is
beyond the acceptable scope of
discretion”.
Circumstances of Offending and Sentence
Proceedings
sentence proceeded on an agreed schedule of facts, backgrounded by the
respondent’s traffic history. The respondent’s
criminal history and
non-TORUM history was not relied upon by the prosecutor at first instance. The
material filed on behalf of
the appellant sought leave to introduce both the
respondent’s criminal history and non-TORUM history pursuant to
Justices Act 1886
(Qld.), which was opposed. At the
hearing of the appeal, the appellant accepted that those were matters which
ought to have been
placed before the learned Magistrate and in those
circumstances, did not press its application to introduce that material in the
appeal proceedings.
respondent was 32 years old at the date of the offending and at
August 2024, Police detected the respondent driving a grey Toyota utility
pulling a trailer not having the number plate
attached displayed correctly. He
was issued a caution for that. The respondent exited the vehicle and when asked
by police, stated
that he did not have a licence on his person. Checks
conducted by police confirmed that the respondent’s driver licence was
court disqualified from 4 September 2023 to 3 September 2025, a period of two
years for similar offences. Police then had a conversation
with the respondent
in which he stated that he was aware that his licence was disqualified, however

in an effort to make money. Police witnessed
the respondent working as a roller door installation tradesperson and utilized

aggravation
. The prosecutor
relied upon the respondent’s six page traffic history which contained a
number of entries for unlicensed driving
dating back to 2011. Between 2011 to
2020, the respondent had three unlicensed driving entries
(simpliciter)
. Since 9 December
2020, there are four entries of disqualified driving by court order.
Subsequently (and as noted earlier) on 4
September 2023 the respondent received
a 9 month period of imprisonment which was wholly suspended for 18 months. The
was committed during the operational period of the suspended sentence.
The prosecutor submitted that considering his history and
that the offending
constitutes the fifth occasion since 2020 that the respondent was before the
court for a disqualified drive, the
only appropriate penalty is that of a period
of imprisonment.
respondent’s solicitor tendered material comprising an outline of
submissions, psychometric assessment of Alena Cullen
dated May 2024, an email
from Uniting Care dated 4 July 2024, a character reference by Shaun Slater dated
8 October 2024, a medical
certificate by Dr Ebony Bray dated 18 December 2024
and a character reference by Paul Holmkvist dated 11 January
. Before the court were a
number of matters in mitigation that was considered by the learned Magistrate,
including in
(a) the respondent’s wife significant medical ailments comprising chronic
fibromyalgia, acute arthritis, severe anxiety, depression,
post-traumatic stress
disorder, psychotic breaks and bipolar personality disorder;
(b) the respondent’s wife not working as a consequence of her medical
ailments with the respondent not only acting as her carer
but also performing
household responsibilities;
(c) the young age of the respondent’s three children: Alena Cullen aged
seven, Jason Cullen aged five and Danielle Cullen aged
(d) Alena Cullen being deemed to meet the diagnostic criteria for level 2
impairment on the Autism Spectrum Disorder;
(e) the respondent’s extreme financial hardship at the time of driving.
The respondent and his wife are not homeowners and
jointly had net liabilities
exceeding $158,000. Through his previous business the respondent personally
owed approximately $70,000
to the Australian Taxation Office and $28,000 to the
Palm Island Council;

an alcoholic and being estranged from her mother.
Mr Cullen’s parents do
not reside in the Townsville region.

serious and
dangerous predicament, because you drove whilst on a disqualification period.
It’s really – it’s wanton disregard of the law
(emphasis added).
[28] Just prior
to handing down the sentence, the learned Magistrate somewhat curiously
“You’ve come to court today probably thinking that you would get
a jail sentence, and in fact 99 cases out of 100 I would
not have thought twice
before imposing that suspended sentence, but that was meant to stop you from
driving. But you’re that

case, and I can give you another chance, but don’t stand there again.

Veen -v- R (No
“The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether
the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration
or whether the offender
has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of
disobedience of the law.
In the latter case, retribution, deterrence, and
protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted.
It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it
illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in
the instant case, or shows
his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter
the offender and other
offenders from committing further offences of a like
[34] Deterrence,
both personal and general, denunciation and community protection were paramount
sentencing considerations pursuant
to section 9(1) of the PSA. The proper
application of such principles ought to have resulted in a sentence greater than
the minimum licence disqualification period. Given the
respondent’s continued disobedience of traffic and licensing rules,

September 2023, and that there were no additional
mitigatory matters outlined at
the sentence hearing before the learned Magistrate, a sentence of imprisonment
was the only appropriate
sentence the respondent received was comparative to that of a first-time
offender, rather than a mature recidivist offender
who committed the offence
whilst subject to a suspended sentence for the same type of offending. While
the respondent provided material
to the court as to hardship and exceptional
circumstances, the appellant submits that it is not clear to what extent these
into account in the sentence imposed, nor was it articulated as to
how those principles applied to the facts in the sentence hearing

considerations, especially when considering the
factors alleged by the
respondent as hardship appear to have been long standing factors extant at the
time of his earlier similar
[36] Given the
respondent’s traffic record and the fact that he had committed the same
offence 11 months into the 18 month operational
period, the learned Magistrate
had not adequately articulated on what basis it could be said to be unjust to
impose the whole of
the outstanding term of suspended imprisonment. The learned
Magistrate acknowledged that “ordinarily...my bottom view is if
you’re on a suspended sentence and you breach it by committing the same
offence, you can expect to have that suspended sentence
. Rather than
considering whether the activation would be unjust, the learned Magistrate
reasoned that a suspended sentence would
not be imposed “except in very
unusual...or exceptional
circumstances”
[37] It was open
for the learned Magistrate to invoke the term, have the term of imprisonment run
concurrently to the head sentence,
and provide the respondent immediate release
on parole as contended for by his lawyers and the prosecutor at
Respondent’s
Submissions
respondent submits that the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate was
lenient but not manifestly inadequate. The genesis
of this submission lies in
the broadness of sentencing discretion and the relevant sentencing
[39] Sentencing
is quintessentially an exercise of judicial discretion exercised on an
individualised basis. The High Court has described
sentencing as a
“synthesis of competing features which attempts to translate the
complexity of the human condition and human
behaviour to the mathematics of
units of punishment usually expressed in time or
[40] There is no
single correct sentence. As asserted by the High Court in
Markarian -v- The
“Express legislative provisions apart, neither principle, nor any of
the grounds of appellate review, dictates the particular
path that a sentencer,
passing sentence in a case where the penalty is not fixed by statute, must
follow in reasoning to the conclusion
that the sentence to be imposed should be
fixed as it is. The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for
review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into
account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations)
forming the conclusion reached. As has now been pointed out more than once,
there is no single correct sentence. And judges
at first instance are to be
allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consistent with consistency of
approach and as accords
with the statutory regime that applies”.
[41] As observed
by Chesterman JA in
“...there is no one “right” penalty in any case. There is
always a range of permissible sentences. Different judges
legitimately put
weight on different circumstances and their opinions must be respected unless
the sentence imposed is beyond the
allowable range, or is otherwise affected by
an error of fact or law”.
[42] Individualised
justice is an important aspect of sentencing. In
Spigelman CJ
“The maintenance of a broad sentencing discretion is essential to
ensure that all of the wide variations of circumstances of
the offence and the
offender are taken into account. Sentences must be
individualised”.
[43] In addition
to the matters in mitigation submitted and considered by the learned Magistrate,
the learned Magistrate was also
entitled to take into account the factual matrix
of the offending, including the manner in which the respondent drove and the
that he did not put other road users or the general public at risk on the
occasion that he drove
deterrence was a relevant sentencing consideration per section 9(1) of the PSA,
the offence was not one that endangered
the safety of the community. A sentence
of imprisonment was still a sentence of last resort, and a sentence that allowed
the respondent
to remain in the community was
[44] The learned
Magistrate’s sentencing remarks evinces a contemplation of a sentence of
imprisonment. However, the learned
Magistrate’s analysis resulted in the
conclusion that the respondent’s case was “unusual” or an
exceptional
one warranting a more lenient penalty. Whilst the appellant refers
to the respondent’s repeated disregard for the disqualification
similar circumstances, there was further material before the court in this
instance that illustrated significant matters
in mitigation and
[45] The learned
Magistrate only took into account relevant
in formulating the
sentence and did not operate on a misunderstanding or misapplication of fact or
law. The transcripts of the hearing
and decision illustrate that the learned
Magistrate had due regard to the varying and competing sentencing
considerations
of the PSA, the learned Magistrate was entitled and obliged to also have
regard to the respondent’s relevant antecedents and
the circumstances in
which the offence was
[46] The nature
of the Magistrates Court must also be remembered. Whilst the learned
Magistrates’ sentencing remarks were not
voluminous, the aggravating
nature of the offending was considered against the factors in mitigation. It
was not a “one sided”
consideration.
[47] Whilst both
parties at first instance submitted the appropriate sentence was one of
imprisonment with the only contention being
the release date, the learned
Magistrate was not bound by either representatives’ sentencing
[48] If the
court disagrees with the respondent’s ultimate submission that the appeal
must fail, then the respondent concurs
with the appellant’s submission
that if the court were to resentence the respondent, it would be to a term of
imprisonment
with an immediate parole
balancing all relevant considerations, the offending was not minor and comprised
repeat offending of a like nature which
previously led to a period of
imprisonment being imposed, albeit a wholly suspended term of imprisonment.
[50] It was not
simply a situation where the penalty imposed was more lenient than what might
have been expected. Rather, it was
manifestly inadequate and unreasonable in
all of the circumstances; noting particularly the acknowledgement on the part of
the learned
Magistrate the respondent’s “wanton disregard for the
law” and that “in 99 cases out of 100”, a sentence
an actual term of imprisonment was the appropriate penalty.
satisfied that the imposition of a fine of a very lenient character in itself is
simply outside the range of what might
have been appropriate in relation to this
[52] Here it is
clear in circumstances where the respondent is burdened with a six-page traffic
history, does not have the benefit
of youth and had been the recipient of
various penalties, including a term of imprisonment subject to an operational
period for a
suspended sentence, that these were significant considerations,
especially considering the respondent’s continued disobedience
and licensing rules. The respondent was clearly not deterred from the penalties
imposed for his prior offending. He
continued to reoffend.
[53] Given the
clear need here for deterrence and punishment in light of the respondent’s
traffic history and offending at first
instance, the perception that the
respondent did not put road users or the public generally at risk as determined
by the learned
Magistrate did not render it unjust for the suspended sentence to
be imposed and should not in itself have prevented a sentence of
imprisonment
being imposed for the subject offending.
[54] In my view
the imposition of a fine was unreasonable and unjust. It fell below what could
be considered the most lenient of
penalties that might be imposed in relation to
the matter. As I have indicated, it is my view therefore that the appeal must
successful.
[55] The orders
of the Court are as follows:

for the period of disqualification imposed on the respondent from holding or
obtaining a Queensland driver licence, the sentencing
