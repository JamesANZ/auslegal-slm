3. Australia Taxation Office, Integrated Fitout of
New Leased Premises, 152 Wharf Street, Brisbane, QLD
3.1 The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) seeks approval from the Committee to
proceed with the proposed integrated fit out of new
leased premises at 152 Wharf
Street, Brisbane, Queensland. The aim of the project is to improve occupational
density in line with
government targets, provide a fit for purpose, flexible
workspace that can respond to the changing needs of the ATO business with
minimal cost and disruption, and an improved efficient building design that
reduces operational costs into the
3.2 The estimated cost of the project is $49.59 million (excluding GST).
3.3 The project was referred to the Committee on 27 November 2019.
Conduct of the
3.4 Following referral, the inquiry was publicised on the Committee’s
website and via media release.
3.5 The Committee received one submission and one confidential submission. A
list of submissions can be found at Appendix A.
3.6 On 26 February 2020, the Committee conducted a project briefing, public
and in-camera hearing in Canberra, Australian Capital
Territory. A transcript of
the public hearing is available on the Committee’s website.
Need for the works
3.7 The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is the principal revenue collection
agency of the Australian Government. Its role is to effectively
manage and shape
the tax and superannuation systems that support and fund services for
Australians.
3.8 Currently the ATO leases four sites in the Brisbane area, ‘one at
Chermside, one at Upper Mount Gravatt and two in the Brisbane
CBD, one of which
is fully sub-leased’.
told the Committee that that project will facilitate the exit of the ATO’s
current Chermside accommodation, due to
expire in February
3.9 The ATO stated in their inquiry submission that:
In order to deliver the required fit for purpose high quality office
accommodation that meets the professional needs of employees
and the nature of
the employees’ work, the ATO needs to deliver a fit out of 17,867 meters
squared in the building being constructed
at 152 Wharf
3.10 The ATO
note that ‘the space being fitted out in the new building being
constructed at 152 Wharf Street exceeds the square
meterage in the existing
lease at Chermside’, however, the additional space will be used to provide
relief for the high demand
for accommodation at the existing 55 Elizabeth Street
3.11 At the public hearing the ATO told the Committee that currently there
were 1,228 staff at the Elizabeth Street site and the ATO
was planning on
accommodating 1,150 staff at the proposed Wharf Street
3.12 When asked by the Committee if the ATO planned to consolidate staff from
Elizabeth street into the proposed Wharf Street site
the ATO stated:
We have a lease already on our Elizabeth Street building in Brisbane. That lease
doesn't expire until 2028, so financially it wouldn't
be the most cost-effective
for government if we actually broke the lease. There's a whole range of issues
that come with that, so
we aren't able to do
3.13 The ATO
further stated that it was a possibility that the Elizabeth Street site may be
consolidated into the Wharf Street site
in the future, however this was
dependent on ‘what happens when our leases come up for
Options considered
3.14 The ATO stated in their submission that it has ‘engaged the
expertise of external consultants, including a Project Manager
and architectural
design team, to work with business to establish the user requirements for the
design of the fit out and to provide
a fit for purpose design that meets ATO
guidelines, Commonwealth property requirements and the ATO’s vision and
3.15 The ATO noted it their submission that their recent ‘experience
delivering fit out projects at their Gosford and Docklands
sites supports the
benefits of open plan, flexible work environments,’ which the ATO attests
has ‘provided the ATO with
improved flexibility to adapt to changing
operational requirements that easily respond to new ways of
3.16 The ATO also noted that ‘post occupancy reports and staff feedback
following these fit out projects has confirmed the flexible
fit out design as a
suitable option for a majority of business areas in the ATO’.
3.17 At the public hearing the ATO stated that:
The building at 152 Wharf Street is centrally located, close to public
transport, childcare services, retail and shopping amenities,
and employment and
education institutions. The location enables the ATO to leverage, source and
maintain a high-quality workforce;
and partner with tertiary
institutions.
the public hearing the ATO told the Committee that despite going out to market
in 2017 ‘we weren't able to source accommodation
that met our requirements
within the Chermside region, and we had no further options on the lease that we
had with Chermside.’
Therefore, the ATO planned to close its Chermside
site and [was] relocating those staff to the proposed Wharf Street
3.19 Additionally, the ATO told the Committee that it was
‘consolidating [it’s] information technology and data people
at other buildings in the Brisbane region into this new Wharf Street
Scope of the works
3.20 At the public hearing the ATO told the Committee that:
The building at 152 Wharf Street is a 24-level commercial tower, and the ATO
proposal is to fit out 14 floors. This fit-out will
provide an occupational
density rate that meets the Department of Finance target of 14 square metres per
person... The fit-out will
include a range of workspaces, including a mix of
traditional, agile and unallocated workstations. Meeting rooms,
videoconferencing
and other corporate rooms will be available, along with a
range of new spaces such as informal collaboration and meeting room areas
will be supported by mobile
technology.
ATO note in their submission that the fit out concept is for a contemporary
open-plan office space and includes:
▪ Professional, contemporary, ‘Grade A’ office
accommodation which meets government occupational density targets
large and efficient floor plates, maximising space and future flexibility
▪ A flexible and adaptable work environment in order to cope with
ongoing changes in business operation and technology
▪ Modular work points that can be easily and quickly reconfigured
▪ Collaboration, offices and meeting areas that are flexible and
designed for future reconfiguration
▪ A robust security system that protects ATO information, people, other
assets and operations
▪ Enhanced conference, training and video conference facilities to
support contemporary work practices
▪ IT infrastructure which will support the needs of the site
▪ First aid room and amenities areas
▪ Contemporary end of trip facilities to support staff wellbeing
including showers, lockers and secure bike storage
▪ Interconnecting stairs between floors to promote connectivity and
wellbeing in the workplace
3.22 In their submission, the ATO stated that the proposed fit-out will
‘meet all applicable codes and standard, including access
requirements and
provision of services’, including wheelchair access, lift arrangements,
toilet and shower
facilities.
Staff consultation
3.23 The ATO stated that it would follow a staff engagement and design
process ‘where each business area will make a decision
on the appropriate
design for their workforce. The design team will assess the information captured
and make a recommendation to
the ATO on the fit out design direction that is
best suited to proceed to detailed
3.24 The ATO stated that staff will be engaged on the design of the fit out
▪ Obtaining team specific requirements such as team sizes, storage, use
of corporate facilities, team specific equipment requirements
▪ Attending information and Q&A sessions about the design
▪ Distribution of staff surveys to seek input and feedback on
individual preferences that could be considered
▪ Discussing and seeking input (or even voting) on themes and colours
for the building
3.25 The ATO also stated that ‘the fit out will be designed to suit the
workforce occupying the building which is achieved through
the establishment of
a Site Working Group. Members of this group include nominated business line
representatives, site leaders, site
executives, union representatives and other
specialty group representatives (e.g. Work Health and Safety, Environmental
3.26 At the public hearing the ATO stated that with regards to involving
staff in the design process:
We haven't put together what the layout or the workspaces will look like in this
building, because we need to go and consult with
our staff to understand what
they want, and then, obviously, we do a detailed consultation process with them.
What we are offering
is three different types of workspace within this building.
We're looking at the allocated, the unallocated and the agile workspace.
the feedback that we've got generally from our staff that are looking to move
into Wharf Street. But, obviously, once it goes
through the Public Works
Committee, we'd be looking at then doing that detailed engagement and
consultation with our staff to understand
what the workspaces and fit-out will
ATO stated that the project imposes ‘no change to jobs or functions
undertaken in the Brisbane region and continues
to support the development and
maintenance of a skilled and professional
workforce’.
consultation
3.28 The ATO stated in their submission that the project at 152 Wharf Street
would benefit the local community as it:
▪ Is it the most cost-effective option for the Commonwealth
▪ Creates jobs during construction and fit out works
▪ Supports local trades and services through ongoing maintenance and
supply requirements
▪ Supports local businesses which will be frequented by ATO employees
and visitors to the Brisbane building
▪ Makes use of existing public transport facilities
▪ Strengthens an important link with tertiary campuses in the
3.29 At the public hearing the ATO told the Committee that:
On all of our property projects the ATO has been committed to maintaining its
strong track record of engagement with the Indigenous
and local business sector.
The ATO actively promotes and facilitates engagement of Indigenous business and
local business. In the
first six months of this financial year we've invested
$20 million in contracts with Indigenous business. Our commercial partnerships
are supporting sustainable benefits through Indigenous employment, business
growth and community investment...We will promote the
engagement of Indigenous
businesses and local businesses for 152 Wharf
Cost of the works
3.30 Australian Taxation Office, Integrated Fit out of New Leased Premises,
152 Wharf Street, Brisbane, Queensland has an estimated
cost of $49.59 million,
exclusive of GST.
3.31 ATO provided further details on project costings in its confidential
submission and during an in-camera hearing.
3.32 The Committee is satisfied that the costings for the project provided to
it have been adequately assessed by the proponent entity.
3.33 The Committee was pleased to hear that the ATO will fund the fit out
within existing departmental capital
3.34 At the public hearing the ATO told the Committee that:
The proposed fit-out maximises value for money, as it enables the ATO to improve
occupational density, provide a fit-for-purpose,
flexible workspace that can
respond to the changing needs of the ATO with minimal cost and disruption, and
provide an approved, efficient
building design that reduces operational costs
3.35 There will be no direct revenue generated by the
Committee comment
3.36 In relation to the staff consultation process, the Committee was pleased
to hear that ATO business areas would be given the opportunity
to feed into the
design for their workforce based on their specific needs. The Committee
encourages ATO to continue to engage openly
with staff throughout the project to
ensure that staff are adequately informed and accommodated.
3.37 The Committee was concerned about the impact that having to relocate
from Chermside to Brisbane city centre would have on staff
with regards to
increased commute times, access to parking and public transport. The Committee
encourages the ATO to continue to
seek feedback from staff and to ensure that
all staff concerns are adequately addressed.
3.38 The ATO informed the Committee that design of the proposed
interconnected circular stairs were a health and wellbeing opportunity
staff, as they were more appealing that the concrete fire stairs. While the
Committee acknowledges the health and wellbeing benefits,
the high per square
meter cost of the proposed staircase was of concern to the Committee. The
Committee encourages the ATO to consider
a final stair case design with a lower
cost per square meter.
3.39 The Committee notes that the current
Elizabeth Street office could potentially be consolidated into the Wharf Street
the future and encourages the ATO to consider this solution should the
opportunity arise.
3.40 The outlining of
the process used by the ATO to identify the Wharf Street site for the works,
highlighted a number of concerns
to the Committee. This is outside the remit of
the Committee’s scrutiny, however, the Committee considers the process to
of sufficient concern that the Australian National Audit Office should
consider investigating the process of site selection for the
Wharf Street
Recommendation 2
3.41 The Committee recommends that the Auditor-General considers
conducting an audit into the process undertaken by the Australian
Office in identifying and selecting 152 Wharf Street as the preferred site for
3.42 Having regard to its role and
responsibilities contained in the
Public Works Committee Act 1969
, and bearing
in mind the current lease expiry date, the Committee is of the view that this
project is fit for purpose, having regard
to the established need.
Recommendation 3
3.43 The Committee recommends that the House of Representatives resolve,
pursuant to
Section 18(7)
Public Works Committee Act 1969
is expedient to carry out the following proposed works: Australian Taxation
Office, Integrated Fit out of New Leased Premises,
152 Wharf Street, Brisbane,
Queensland.
3.44 Proponent entities must notify the Committee of any changes to the
project scope, time, cost, function or design. The Committee
also requires that
a post-implementation report be provided within three months of project
completion. A report template can be found
