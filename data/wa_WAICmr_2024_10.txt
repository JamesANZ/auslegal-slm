Commissioner

The agency identified 114 documents within
the scope of the complainant’s access application. By notice of decision
February 2024, the agency gave access in full to 71 documents and
refused access in full to 43 documents on the grounds they were
exempt under
either or both clauses 3(1) and 6(1) of Schedule 1 to the FOI Act. The
complainant sought internal review of the agency’s
decision. By internal
review decision dated 22 March 2024, the agency varied the initial
decision by deciding to give full access
to one document and to give edited
access to two documents. The agency confirmed the initial decision to refuse
access in full to
40 documents (
the disputed documents
March 2024, the complainant applied to the Commissioner for external review of
the agency’s decision to refuse access
to the disputed documents. The
Commissioner obtained the disputed documents from the agency, together with the
FOI file maintained
by the agency in respect of the access application.
On 2 May 2024, one of the Commissioner’s officers provided the
parties with their assessment of the matter (
). It was the
officer’s assessment that the Commissioner was likely to be of the view,
based on the information before her,
that the disputed documents are exempt
under clause 3(1) of Schedule 1 to the FOI Act (
clause 3(1)
). In light
of the officer’s assessment, he noted that it was not necessary for the
Commissioner to consider the agency’s
clause 6(1) exemption
The complainant did not accept the officer’s assessment and
provided further submissions. After considering all of the material
before her,
including the disputed documents, the officer’s assessment and the
complainant’s further submissions, the
Commissioner agreed that the
disputed documents were exempt under clause 3(1).
Clause 3(1) provides
that matter is exempt matter if its disclosure would reveal personal information
living or dead). Personal information is exempt
under clause 3(1) subject to the application of the limits on the exemption set
out in clauses 3(2) to 3(6).
The Commissioner was satisfied that
disclosure of the disputed documents would reveal personal information about
individuals and were
therefore, on their face, exempt under clause 3(1).
The Commissioner considered the only relevant limit on the exemption that
may apply to the disputed documents was clause 3(6). Clause
3(6) provides that
matter is not exempt under clause 3(1) if its disclosure would, on balance, be
in the public interest. Under
section 102(3), the onus was on the complainant,
as the access applicant, to establish that disclosure of the disputed documents
would, on balance, be in the public interest.
As no restrictions or
conditions can be placed upon the release of documents under the FOI Act, it is
well established that disclosure
of information under the FOI Act is disclosure
to the world at large: see
Public Transport Authority
[2018] WASC 47
. Accordingly, when considering whether or not to disclose documents under
the FOI Act, the effects of disclosure are generally considered
disclosure were to the world, rather than only to the particular access
In favour of disclosure, the Commissioner recognised the public interest in the
accountability of agencies for the manner in which
they discharge their
functions and obligations. The Commissioner also recognised public interests in
the actions and decisions of
agencies being as transparent as possible and in
the public having confidence that agencies properly perform their functions
in this case, the regulatory functions performed by the agency.
The Commissioner noted the existence of various accountability mechanisms
including the designated complaints branch of the agency
which deals with
complaints about legal practitioners; the right of a person, who has made a
complaint to the agency, to request
internal review of the agency’s
decision to close their complaint; the ability to make complaints to the State
Ombudsman about
the decision-making and administrative practices of the agency;
and the public availability of both the ‘Roll’ of legal
practitioners and the ‘Register of Disciplinary Action’ which
records the disciplinary action taken against legal practitioners.
In light of
the accountability mechanisms available, the Commissioner was not persuaded that
the above public interests in favour
of disclosure required the disclosure of
the disputed documents to the complainant or, potentially, to the world at
Weighing against disclosure, the Commissioner recognised a strong public
interest in maintaining personal privacy and noted that this
public interest may
only be displaced by some other strong or compelling public interest or
interests that require the disclosure
of personal information about one person
to another person.
The Commissioner considered that, in cases such as
this, where the agency has considered the concerns raised about the conduct of
practitioner; assessed what regulatory action is appropriate; and concluded that
no further action is proposed, the public interest
in protecting the privacy of
the practitioner is strong.
In balancing the competing public interests,
the Commissioner was of the view that the public interests favouring disclosure
disputed documents were not sufficient to outweigh the strong public
interest in the protection of the personal privacy of other
individuals.
Therefore, the Commissioner was not persuaded that disclosure of the disputed
documents would, on balance, be in the
public interest and found that the limit
on the exemption in clause 3(6) did not apply.
Accordingly, the
Commissioner found that the disputed documents are exempt under clause 3(1) of
Schedule 1 to the FOI Act and confirmed
the agency’s decision.
