Reasons for Decision (Given Ex Tempore)
Kevin George Lovell (
) filed an application with the Western
Australian Industrial Relations Commission (
) on 23 November
2023, alleging his dismissal by Downer Engineering Power Pty Ltd
(respondent
), was unfair.
19 December 2023, the respondent filed its response and contended that the
Commission does not have jurisdiction to determine this
application. The
respondent submitted they are a trading corporation and a National System
Employer for the purposes of the
Fair Work Act 2009
therefore not covered by the State Industrial Relations System.
the respondent also alleges the Commission does not have jurisdiction, as the
applicant was not an employee of the respondent;
they were contracted through a
labour hire agency in which the respondent had an arrangement with.
Notwithstanding
the respondent’s view that the Commission lacked the necessary
in conciliation.
7 February 2024, a conciliation conference was held for the purpose of
facilitating discussion to resolve matters. The respondent
committed to
providing an update to the applicant, as to whether the report he submitted
regarding site matters had been actioned.
22 March 2024, the respondent emailed the Commission and the applicant as
Dear Commissioner Walkington
As an outcome of the conciliation in matter U 90/2023, and notwithstanding
the fact the Respondent, Downer Engineering Power Pty Ltd
national system employer covered by the
Fair Work Act 2009
(Cth) (and the
WAIRC has no jurisdiction to deal with this application), Downer committed to
providing an update to Mr Lovell as to
whether the report he made regarding site
matters had been received and considered.
There was a delay in providing this due to the relevant site contact being on
a period of R&R and Ms Elkins resigning from the
I have now been provided with a timeline of events and actions taken by the
business in response to Mr Lovell’s concerns.
The business confirms that Mr Lovell’s complaint was received,
investigated and treated seriously. Mr Lovell has been copied
email by way of service.
On the basis that the WAIRC does not have jurisdiction to deal with this
application, we respectfully request that the application
be dismissed.
10 April 2025, the Commission emailed the parties, noting no further
communication had been received in relation to this matter,
and requested that
the applicant file a
Form 1A – Notice of Discontinuance
discontinue the application.
21 July 2025, the Commission sent a further email asking the applicant to
confirm their intentions, or to file a
Form 1A – Notice of
Discontinuance
if they no longer wished to proceed.
22 August 2025, the Commission advised that if there was no further
correspondence, or if a
Form 1A – Notice of Discontinuance
filed and returned to the Commission’s Registry, a Show Cause Hearing
would be listed for the applicant to show cause
why the matter ought not be
dismissed pursuant to
Industrial Relations Act
9 September 2025, noting there was no response received from either party, the
Commission listed a Show Cause Hearing for 4 November
2025 at 10:30 am, for the
applicant to show why the matter ought not be dismissed for want of prosecution.
parties were issued with a Notice of Hearing by email on 9 September 2025. The
email notified the applicant that should he not
attend the show cause hearing
listed for 4 November 2025, his application may be dismissed for want of
prosecution.
20 October 2025, the Show Cause Hearing was re-listed to 6 November 2025. Both
parties were issued with a ‘Notice of Hearing’
by email on the same
applicant did not attend the hearing. I am satisfied the Applicant was properly
notified of this hearing in accordance with the
Industrial Relations Commission Regulations 2005
(WA) and the hearing may
proceed in his absence.
note also that the Respondent did not attend, however, the respondent was
advised that their appearance was not required.
am satisfied that the applicant has been given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard on why his application ought not be dismissed
for want of prosecution or
lack of jurisdiction. The applicant has been given several opportunities to
communicate with the Commission,
and he has not done so.
the respondent’s correspondence on 22 March 2024 indicates the matter has
been resolved, and there has been no communication
from the applicant to say
the lack of any communication from the applicant, I consider the applicant has
failed to progress his application and does not
have sufficient interest in the
matter. As such, I will dismiss the application for want of prosecution.
