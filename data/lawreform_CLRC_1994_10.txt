computer is able to run on a differently configured
computer. This generally
involves modification of the original program.
Public domain computer programs
Programs which the copyright owner has granted the world at large a licence
to reproduce. While copyright subsists in such programs
the copyright owner is,
however, precluded from claiming damages from anyone who reproduces the
Reverse engineering
The study or analysis of a computer product (including a computer program) in
order to reveal the underlying idea or principle on
which it operates. This
analysis may include an examination of relevant published documentation, study
of the operation of the product
and, in the case of a computer programs, their
decompilation. Studying the operation of a program would involve reproduction of
program in the same way as normal use.
Programs which have been made available for users to reproduce and use free
of charge subject to certain conditions. Typical conditions
that apply to
shareware are that it is freely transferable to other users provided that after
a specified period the user(s) cease
to use it or make a payment to the
Source code
The class of computer languages expressed in human readable form and which
allow a human programmer to work with instructions rather
than binary or
hexadecimal numbers.
Terms of Reference
1.01 On 19 October 1988 the then acting Attorney-General, Senator Michael
Tate, announced the inquiry by the Copyright Law Review
Committee into the
reference were:
Whether the
, as amended by the
Amendment Act 1984
, adequately and appropriately protects computer programs
in human and machine readable forms, works created by or with the assistance
computer programs, and works stored in computer memory.
, which expressly extended
the first judicial consideration
of the application of the
(the Act), as it previously stood, to computer programs. It may be
useful if, at the outset, attention is drawn to the definition
“computer program” which was introduced into the Act by the 1984
amendments and was central to the Committee’s
deliberations:
“computer program” means an expression, in any language, code or
notation, of a set of instructions (whether with or without
related information)
intended, either directly or after either or both of the following:
(a) conversion to another language, code or notation;
(b) reproduction in a different material form;
to cause a device having digital information processing capabilities to
perform a particular function.
1.03 The Committee received two additions to its terms of reference. By
letter dated 5 January 1989, the then Attorney-General, Mr
Bowen, asked the
Committee to review its 1988
Report on the Importation Provisions of the
as it applies to computer programs. On 18 January 1991
the acting Attorney-General, Senator Michael Tate, asked the Committee to
Whether there is any need to amend
provide expressly that the copyright in a published edition extends beyond
reproduction by a means that includes a photographic
process to reproduction
from a database where entry of the work was effected by purely electronic or
mechanical means.
SCOPE OF THE TERMS OF REFERENCE
1.04 In the period that the Committee has had the reference, an enormous
amount of relevant literature has been published. Much of
this material is
important and a deal of it is comparatively recent. It originates principally
from the academic and legal communities
and the industry. It is to be found in a
variety of textbooks, academic, legal and computer industry journals, and other
publications. The Committee has attempted to keep abreast of this
material but does not pretend that it is familiar with it all.
The task of
endeavouring to keep up with it has been a continuing one, made the more arduous
by the rate of development of the technology
with which it is dealing, and the
local and international events to which reference has been made.
1.05 The Committee is extremely grateful for the assistance it has received.
Many of the written submissions, both prior to the release
of the Draft Report
and later in response to it, have been painstakingly prepared and are of a most
elaborate kind. In addition,
the Committee greatly benefited from the open
discussion which took place at the public hearings and, despite the fact that
were held in camera, the demonstrations conducted by IBM Australia Ltd, the
Supporters of Interoperable Systems in Australia and
Alcatel Australia Ltd. The
Committee has also benefited from its informal discussions, which one or more of
its members and its Secretary
have had, with various persons, particularly those
from the academic and legal communities. The Chairman is particularly grateful
for the helpful discussions he had with representatives of a number of United
States companies when he was in the United States in
1.06 The Committee’s task has been a most onerous one. It has involved
the Committee in a substantial number of long meetings.
Since 1989 it has met,
mainly in connection with this reference, on more than 20 occasions, each time
for a full day or more. It
has had a voluminous reading task and it has had the
difficulty of reaching conclusions on a large number of issues about many of
which there is considerable disagreement in academic and industry circles both
in Australia and overseas.
1.07 It should be clear that the Committee has endeavoured to confine its
report to the issues which appear to it to be the most significant
recognises that it may have omitted some matters which some may think are
important, but it believes that it has covered
the critical ones. A further
point that needs to be made is that the Committee has thought it unwise to write
an elaborate treatise
on computers and computer programs or on the law of this
and other countries relating to them. The Committee has endeavoured to produce
report which contains sufficient reference to the technology and the applicable
law, both statutory and judge-made, and to concentrate
on the principal
considerations relevant to the determination of each issue.
1.08 This report is to the Minister for Justice, but it is clear that it will
be widely read and considered by relevant interests
both here and overseas. An
attempt has been made to write a report which will be able to be comprehended,
not only by persons well
familiar with the technology and the issues which are
in question, but also by others with less familiarity with what is involved
members of Parliament) who will nevertheless have the task of considering the
report and deciding whether or not its recommendations
implemented.
Summary of Recommendations
2.01 Before stating its recommendations, the Committee wishes to emphasise
that none of its recommendations is intended to undermine
or weaken the quality
of the protection of the rights which owners of computer programs should
reasonably have. The Committee is
aware that the Australian Government is
committed to the proper protection of intellectual property rights of all kinds.
The Committee
is strongly supportive of the Government’s commitment in
that regard. Nevertheless, in the creation and protection of any property
rights, an attempt must be made to strike the right balance between adequate
protection and the need to provide the community with
reasonable access to
intellectual property and the benefits which it confers. That there should be
such access is important to the
owners of intellectual property themselves as
well as to potential users of it and the public generally. The striking of the
is something which must be attempted in the public interest. The task
has not been an easy one.
2.02 The Committee’s Draft Report on Computer Software Protection was
released for public comment in June 1993 and 42 responses
were received by the
Committee in response to its draft recommendations. The Committee has considered
all of those submissions in
revising its Draft Report and some have led the
Committee to change its draft recommendations. Of most significance are the
Committee’s
changed recommendations in relation to the definition of
reproduction in the Act (Chapter 6), s.35 of the Act concerning ownership
(Chapter 7) and the parallel importation provisions (Chapter 11). The Committee
has also revised its recommendations in relation
to computer-generated materials
(Chapter 13), published edition copyright (Chapter 15) and some exceptions to
exclusive rights in
Chapter 10, such as back-up copying, decompilation for error
correction and the overlap between the
(the Act) and
Circuit Layouts Act 1989
. The recommendations from each chapter of
the report are set out below. References to paragraph numbers in brackets are to
paragraphs in which the recommendation is made in the respective
CHAPTER 4 — FORM OF PROTECTION
2.03 The Committee confirms its draft recommendation that computer programs
(see paragraph 2.04(c) for the recommended definition
of this expression) should
continue to be protected under the Act as “literary works”(paragraph
CHAPTER 6 — THE 1984 AMENDMENTS
2.04 The Committee has amended the recommendations it made in the Draft
Report and now recommends that:
(a) The words “whether or not in a visible form” be deleted from
the definition of “literary work” in s.10(1)
of the Act (paragraph
(b) A definition of computer program be retained in the Act (paragraph
(c) The definition of “computer program” in s.10(1) of the Act be
deleted and the following definition substituted (paragraph
A “computer program” is a set of statements or instructions to be
used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to
bring about a certain
(d) No change be made to the Act to expressly state that algorithms are not
protected (paragraph 6.36)
(e) A clarifying definition of “reproduction” be added to the Act
in relation to:
(i) Works stored electronically—The Act should deem that the mere
conversion of a work or an adaptation of a work from its hard
readable form to an electronic form of storage, such as digital, which is
machine readable and which, when printed out
is unintelligible by reason of
consisting of machine readable symbols to be a reproduction of the work or
the adaptation. Similarly the instance of converting a work or an adaptation
from an electronic form to a hard copy, such as making
a print out of a work
stored electronically should be encompassed in the deeming definition (paragraph
(ii) Computer programs in source code and object code—Given the close
relationship between source code and object code versions
of a program, a
majority of the Committee recommend that the Act should be amended by the
addition of a deeming provision which provides
that, in relation to a computer
program, a reproduction includes (but is not limited to) (paragraph 6.76):
) an object code version of the program that has been derived from
the program in source code by compilation; and
) a source code version of the program that has been derived from
the program in object code by decompilation.
The Chairman is of the opinion that there should be no definition of
“reproduction” and that any problem can be overcome
change to the definition of “adaptation”.
(f) No change be made to the definition of “adaptation” in
s.10(1) of the Act (paragraph 6.77)
(g) No change be made to the definition of “material form” in
s.10(1) of the Act (paragraph 6.87).
CHAPTER 7 — OWNERSHIP
2.05 In the Draft Report the Committee recommended that s.35 of the Act be
amended (draft recommendation 2.04). The Committee now
recommends that no change
be made to the provisions of s.35(6) of the Act in its application to computer
programs (paragraphs 7.05
CHAPTER 8 — DURATION
2.06 The Committee affirms its draft recommendation that:
(a) The existing term of protection consisting of life of the author plus 50
years should apply to all computer programs, whether
published or unpublished
(paragraph 8.03)
(b) No other changes should be made to the existing provisions of the Act
concerning duration of protection of computer programs (paragraph
CHAPTER 9 — EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS
Economic rights
2.07 The Committee affirms its recommendation made in the Draft Report that
the owner of copyright in a computer program should have
the same exclusive
rights as are provided for in s.31 of the Act in relation to literary works.
The right to reproduce the work in a material
2.08 The Committee recommends that the author of a computer program should
have the exclusive right to control the reproduction of
his or her work
(paragraph 9.08).
Look and feel
2.09 The Committee recommends that no amendments should be made to the Act to
establish additional protection for the “look
and feel” of computer
programs (paragraph 9.42).
Screen displays
2.10 In the Draft Report the Committee sought submissions on the need for
additional or alternative protection for screen displays
(paragraph 9.42). After
considering the submissions received following the Draft Report, the Committee
has decided not to recommend
any additional form of protection for screen
displays (paragraph 9.48).
The other rights in section 31
2.11 The unauthorised exercise of these rights should continue to constitute
an infringement of copyright subject only to the existing
exceptions in the Act,
as modified by the Committee’s recommendations concerning normal use,
back-up copying, the making of
adaptations to improve or facilitate use, error
correction, and decompilation for interoperability. The rights which the
owner should have are:
(a) the right to make an adaptation of the work; (paragraph 9.53)
(b) the right to publish the work; (paragraph 9.58)
(c) the right to perform the work in public, to the extent that it is
relevant to computer programs; (paragraph 9.64)
(d) the right to broadcast the work, taking account of the recommendations in
the Copyright Convergence Group’s (CCG) report;
and (paragraph 9.68)
(e) the right to cause the work to be transmitted to subscribers to a
diffusion service, subject to the recommendation of the CCG
that this right be
encompassed within a new transmission right (paragraph 9.74).
A right to control rental of computer
2.12 The Committee affirms its draft recommendation that a rental right be
introduced for copyright owners of computer programs, noting
recommendation has now been fully endorsed by the TRIPS Agreement. The right
should be subject to the limitation that it
does not extend to copies of
computer programs incorporated in utilitarian articles or other articles where
the program cannot be
copied during the ordinary use of those articles
(paragraph 9.85).
A right to control public lending of computer
2.13 In the Draft Report the Committee expressed the view that a public
lending right with respect to computer programs should not
be introduced, but
invited further comment on this issue. Following its consideration of the five
submissions that it received commenting
on the possible introduction of such a
right, the Committee still inclines to the view that an exclusive right to
authorise or prohibit
public lending of computer programs by copyright owners
should not be introduced at this time. However, the Committee considers
this issue could be reviewed at a future date as part of the Committee’s
review of the Act (paragraph 9.92).
Moral rights
2.14 The Committee is of the view that authors of computer programs should
not be in a worse position than authors of other literary
works. However, the
Committee remains of the view, that it expressed in its 1988
Report on Moral
that there is no need for the enactment of specific new legislation
for the protection of moral rights of authors, including authors
of computer
programs. But, the Committee does endorse the approach proposed in the
Discussion Paper,
Proposed Moral Rights Legislation for Copyright
, as a general test to determine whether exercising a moral right is
reasonable in any particular case (paragraph 9.99).
CHAPTER 10 — EXCEPTIONS TO EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS
Copying for normal use
2.15 The Committee affirms its draft recommendation that the Act should be
amended to expressly provide that the copyright in a computer
program is not
infringed by a person who copies that program where the making of that copy is
reasonable or necessary for the normal
use of the program (paragraphs 10.12).
Back-up copying
2.16 The Committee recommends that s.43A(1)(b) of the
Act be amended
so that it applies to licensees (paragraph 10.14).
2.17 The Committee affirms it draft recommendations that s.43A be amended
(paragraph 10.15):
(a) to enable a person who has made a back-up copy of a computer program to
use that back-up copy and store the original copy ;
(b) to provide that, if the original copy or a back-up copy is destroyed or
damaged, the surviving original or back-up copy, as the
case may be, may be used
to make another back-up copy; and
(c) to provide that there should be no limitation on the number of times that
the making of a copy in accordance with (b) may be done.
2.18 The Committee reverses its draft recommendation that the amendments to
s.43A should be made subject to s.43A(2)(b) and now recommends
that s.43A(2)(b)
be repealed (paragraph 10.16).
2.19 The Committee recommends that the right to make a back-up copy should
not extend to copies of computer programs that have been
“locked” by
the copyright owner against the making of copies (paragraph 10.17)
Ephemeral back-up copying by businesses
2.20 The Committee recommends that the Act be amended to provide that the
making of an ephemeral back-up copy of a computer program
that is incidental to
the normal back-up copying of business data for security purposes is not an
infringement of copyright (paragraph
Third party maintainers
2.21 The Committee recommends that the copying of computer programs by third
party maintainers should remain a matter for negotiation
between the third party
maintainer and the copyright owner (paragraph 10.20).
Reverse engineering and decompilation
2.22 The Committee recommends that reverse engineering that includes
decompilation should be prohibited except to the extent that
it is required for
interoperability and error correction (paragraph 10.25).
Interoperability with other programs and
2.23 The Committee recommends that decompilation of a computer program should
be allowed where it is necessary to achieve the interoperability
independently created computer program or hardware device with other programs or
hardware devices
provided (paragraph 10.58):
(a) decompilation is performed by the owner of a lawfully acquired copy of
the program or another person having a right to use the
copy or on their behalf
by a person authorised to do so; and
(b) the information necessary
to achieve interoperability has not
previously been readily available; and
(c) the acts are confined to those
necessary to achieve
interoperability.
The following limitations should apply:
(i) the decompilation should only be used to achieve interoperability;
(ii) the information obtained should only be given to others when necessary
for the interoperability of the independently created
computer program or
hardware device
Modification for enhanced performance
2.24 The Committee recommends that the right to modify computer programs for
enhanced performance should remain a matter for negotiation
between the
purchaser and the copyright owner (paragraph 10.59).
Modification for networking
2.25 The Committee recommends that the right to modify computer programs to
run on networks should be left to negotiation between
the purchaser and the
2.26 The Committee recommends that (paragraph 10.68):
(a) that the right to decompile for such purposes should continue to be a
matter for negotiation with the copyright owner; and
(b) no change should be made to the Act to allow porting.
Decompilation for error correction
2.27 The Committee has reconsidered its draft recommendations in relation to
decompilation for error correction and now recommends
(a) the Act should be amended to provide that decompilation for error
correction should not be an infringement of copyright where
an error free
version of the program cannot be obtained within a reasonable time at a normal
commercial price (paragraphs 10.75 and
10.85); and
(b) decompilation for error correction be allowed to ensure the correct
operation of a program with another program(s) or hardware
device(s) provided
(paragraph 10.84):
(i) decompilation is performed by the owner of a lawfully acquired copy of
the program or another person having a right to use the
copy or on their behalf
by a person authorised to do so;
(ii) a version of the computer program free of the error has not previously
been readily available;
(iii) the acts are confined to those necessary to correct the error; and
(iv) a version of the program free of the error is not available within a
reasonable time at a normal commercial price.
The following limitations should apply:
(i) the decompilation should only be used to achieve error correction;
(ii) the information obtained should only be given to others for the purpose
of correcting errors.
Decompilation to understand techniques
2.28 The Committee has reconsidered its draft recommendation that
decompilation to understand techniques should be governed by the
fair dealing
provisions of the Act and adds the qualification to this recommendation that the
fair dealing provisions of the Act
should only apply in respect of
“non-commercial” activities (paragraph 10.89).
Decompilation to defeat program
2.29 Subject to the Committee’s recommendations concerning copying for
back-up copying, interoperability and error correction,
the modification of a
locked computer program for the purpose of circumventing the lock should be
prohibited as should subsequent
copying of such modified programs (paragraph
Reproduction in the course of studying the operation
of a program: Article 5(3) of the EC Directive on Computer Programs
2.30 The Committee recommends that the Act be amended to allow the
reproduction and study of computer programs in the circumstances
contemplated in
article 5(3) of the EC
Directive on the Legal Protection of Computer
(paragraph 10.96).
Contracting out
2.31 The Committee recommends that the Act be amended to ensure that the
Committee’s recommendations concerning decompilation,
back-up copying and
reproduction in the course of studying the operation of a program cannot be
avoided by contractual means (paragraph
The onus of proof
2.32 The Committee affirms its draft recommendation that the Act should
provide that a person who copies another’s program without
a licence and
who seeks to justify it under an exception requiring the copying to have had a
certain purpose should have the onus
of satisfying the court that he or she had
that purpose. By way of further qualification, the Committee recommends that a
who is relying on an exception to infringement should have to show that
it was not possible to rely on any warranty in the time available
or required to
fix the software (paragraph 10.108).
Crown use of computer programs
2.33 The Committee affirms its draft
recommendation that s.183 be
amended to provide that copying of computer programs for the services of the
Commonwealth, State and
Territory Governments should be restricted to those
cases where a copy of the program cannot be obtained from the copyright owner
his or her agent within a reasonable time at a normal commercial price
(paragraphs 10.119 and 10.122).
2.34 The Committee affirms its draft recommendation that no change be made to
the Act in respect of unauthorised home copying of computer
programs (paragraph
Shareware and public domain computer
2.35 The Committee affirms its draft recommendation that no amendments be
made to the Act to define the terms “shareware”
and “public
domain computer programs” or to make special provision for these two
categories of computer programs (paragraph
Overlap of the
Circuit Layouts Act 1989
2.36 Following its consideration of the submissions made in response to its
draft recommendation, the Committee recommends that appropriate
amendments be
made to the Act and the
Circuit Layouts Act 1989
so that (paragraph
(a) where the purpose of importing an integrated circuit is to import a
of copyright in the
embodied work should be able to control that importation (ie the
would apply); and
(b) where the purpose of the importation is to import an article that is not
the copyright work then the
Circuit Layouts Act 1989
should apply.
2.37 The Committee affirms its draft recommendation that the concluding words
Circuit Layouts Act 1989
“infringement of that
without the consent of
the copyright owner in the place of manufacture
(paragraph 10.144).
CHAPTER 11 — PARALLEL IMPORTATION
Decriminalisation of parallel importation
2.38 The Committee’s 1988 recommendation with respect to
decriminalisation was made in the context of a limited right to allow
importation to meet specific orders where a product was not available. However,
as the Committee is of the view that the
parallel importation provisions, as
they apply to computer programs, should be maintained and that availability of
computer programs
is not a pressing problem, the Committee recommends that
criminal sanctions in respect of parallel importation should remain (paragraph
The importation provisions
The Committee’s recommendations as revised are that:
(a) the restrictions on parallel importation of computer programs remain
unchanged (paragraph 11.96);
(b) the position be reviewed in three years time (one member recommends in
two years time) (paragraph 11.96);
(c) computer manuals that are available separately from computer programs
should be able to be imported in the same way as other books
(paragraph 11.103);
(d) its recommendation concerning the importation provisions should apply
equally to second-hand computer programs (paragraph 11.105).
CHAPTER 12 — EDUCATIONAL USE OF COMPUTER
2.40 The Committee has not changed its draft recommendations that (paragraph
(a) in accordance with the expressed preference of most educational
institutions and makers of computer programs that a statutory
licence scheme for
the educational use of computer programs should not be established; and
(b) the Government review the situation in three years time to determine
whether an optional statutory licence scheme should be introduced
to encourage
voluntary licensing.
2.41 In relation to the issue of authorisation of copyright infringement by
educational institutions, the Committee recommends that
no change be made to the
Act in this respect (paragraph 12.21).
CHAPTER 13 — WORKS MADE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF
COMPUTER PROGRAMS AND COMPUTER-GENERATED MATERIALS
2.42 The Committee has revised its draft recommendations and now recommends
(a) protection be afforded to “computer-generated material” as a
new class of subject matter other than works in the Act
(paragraph 13.17).
(b) a definition of the term “computer-generated” be added to the
Act that provides (paragraph 13.18):
“computer-generated”, in relation to computer-generated material
means that the material is generated by computer in
circumstances such that
there is no human author of the material.
(c) the Act be amended to provide that with respect to authorship of
computer-generated material, the author shall be taken to be
the person by whom
the arrangements necessary for the creation of the material are undertaken
(paragraph 13.21).
(d) the Act be amended to provide that the term of protection of
“computer-generated” material be 25 years from the end
of the year
in which the material is made (paragraph 13.23).
CHAPTER 14 — WORKS STORED IN COMPUTER MEMORY:
A use right
2.43 The Committee considers that the introduction of a use right for
into and from
computer memory is not justified or necessary and does not recommend any
further consideration of the introduction
of such an additional right (paragraph
Electrocopying
2.44 The Committee does not recommend the introduction of a statutory licence
in relation to the electrocopying of works (paragraph
2.45 The Committee recommends that the Act be amended to extend the
agreements involving the use of copyright materials in electronic databases
(paragraph 14.16).
Liability of database operators
2.46 The Committee reaffirms its draft recommendation that the Act be amended
to include a provision to the effect that where the
licence of a database
provider does not extend to authorising the making of a hardcopy/ies by a
the database to subscribers would not, of
itself, amount to authorisation of the making of such copies if the operator
arranges for
a message to advise subscribers of their copyright liability for
such reproduction (paragraph 14.19).
Copying by libraries and educational
institutions
2.47 The Committee recommends that ss.49 and 50 of the Act be amended to
ensure that libraries are able to make electronic copies
(including electronic
transmission of a copy stored in digital form and the loan of an electronic copy
of a work on a carrier such
as floppy disk) available to library users within
the limits prescribed by these sections and subject to payment of royalties
applicable, as now apply to the making of hard copies (paragraph 14.25).
2.48 The Committee recommends amendment to s.39A of the Act, so that
(paragraph 14.27):
(a) the reference to “reprographic” copies is deleted; and
(b) where a work stored on a library or archives database is displayed via a
computer terminal made available to users, the library
is required to
incorporate a notice with the display of the work that advises users of the
incurred by printing out the work.
2.49 The Committee commends for consideration the suggestion that the
educational licence scheme in Part VB include the requirement
that a notice be
incorporated with the display of a work stored on a networked database that
advises users of network terminals of
the copyright obligations incurred by
printing out the work (paragraph 14.28).
Section 40—fair dealing
2.50 The Committee does not consider that a sufficient case has been made out
for recommending explicit exclusion of electrocopying
from the concept of
“copying” in s.40 and therefore recommends that no change be made to
the section (paragraph 14.29).
Screen displays
2.51 The Committee does not make any recommendation regarding the
transmission right proposed by the Copyright Convergence Group in
Highways to Change—Copyright in the New Communications Environment
but it supports in principle its introduction and its application to screen
displays (paragraph 14.40).
The Committee affirms its draft recommendation that the Act be
amended to make it clear that screen displays do not constitute a reproduction
in a material form of works stored in computer memory (paragraph 14.42).
2.53 The Committee affirms the view expressed in the Draft Report that it
should not recommend the introduction of a “display
right” for works
stored in computer memory (paragraph 14.43).
2.54 The Committee also affirms its draft recommendation that, if its
recommendation in regard to the jurisdiction of the Copyright
Tribunal is
accepted then, an amendment be made to the Act requiring the Copyright Tribunal
to take into account a proposal by a
display access when arbitrating a dispute under Part VI of the Act (paragraph
2.55 The Committee recommends, as it did in the Draft Report, that the Act be
amended to provide that the screen display of a work
stored in computer memory
does not, by itself, constitute a public performance of that work (paragraph
The Committee recommends no change to the diffusion right, while
recognising that the recommendations of the Copyright Convergence
implemented, will impact on this right (paragraph 14.50).
Definition of literary work
2.57 The Committee adheres to the recommendation it made in the Draft Report
that no amendment is necessary to the definition of literary
work either to
specifically include a reference to computer databases or to define compilation
(paragraph 14.64).
Term of protection
2.58 The Committee remains of the view that databases should be protected for
the same period as other literary works and, accordingly,
does not recommend any
change to the Act (paragraph 14.65).
2.59 As the Committee is limited by its terms of reference, the Committee
does not recommend any change in the law regarding the authorship
of works which
are created and stored in computer memory (paragraph 14.72).
2.60 The Committee does not recommend any change to the law regarding the
ownership of copyright in respect of works stored or created
in computer memory
being of the view that the mere fact that works are in this form of storage does
not of itself warrant or require
any change in the Act (paragraph 14.73).
Protection of non-original databases
2.61 The Committee is of the view that a decision that Australia adopt a
right of unfair extraction should be deferred until consideration
has been given
to the final form of the EC
Amended Proposal for a Council Directive on the
Legal Protection of Databases
and accordingly the Committee recommends
further review of this issue bearing in mind developments in relation to this
(paragraph 14.80).
2.62 In its Draft Report, the Committee invited comment on the form of
protection, if any, that should be afforded hypertexts. Having
reconsidered the
issue in the light of only one comment on protection of hypertexts, the
Committee makes no recommendation on additional
or alternative protection for
hypertexts (paragraph 14.82).
Multi-media
2.63 Having given further consideration to the nature of multi-media
materials and the issue of copyright protection for multi-media,
the Committee
(paragraph 14.87):
(a) does not recommend the creation of a new category of protection for
multi-media; and
(b) does accept that affording protection to multi-media within the category
of “cinematograph film” stretches the generally
understood meaning
of that term and therefore recommends consideration of a more appropriate term,
such as “audiovisual work”
which could encompass cinematograph films
and multi-media materials.
Section 183—government use of copyright
materials held on database
2.64 As the Committee understands that the Government has made a decision to
enact reforms to s.183 which are currently being drafted
for presentation to
Parliament, the Committee does not make any recommendation in relation to s.183
as it applies to government use
of copyright materials held on database
(paragraph 14.91).
CHAPTER 15 — PUBLISHED EDITION COPYRIGHT
2.65 The Committee has revised its draft recommendations and now recommends
(a) the words “by a means that includes a photographic process, a
reproduction” in s.88 of the Act be deleted and the
facsimile copy” be inserted as their replacement (paragraph 15.14);
(b) with the exception of one member, the Act be amended to provide that
published edition copyright be extended to include publication
in computer or
machine readable format (paragraph 15.22).
CHAPTER 16 — OTHER ISSUES
Delivery of material to the National Library of
2.66 The Committee (with the exception of one member) recommends that
(paragraph 16.10):
(a) the definition in s.201 of the Act be amended to include computer
programs and works stored in computer memory; and
(b) in relation to these classes of materials, the National Library should be
given a discretion to determine the particular materials
for inclusion in its
collection.
Archival copying of materials into machine readable
2.67 The Committee affirms its draft recommendation that archives should be
allowed to make copies of computer programs for the limited
purposes of
preserving and accessing archival material deposited in machine readable form
(paragraph 16.15).
Proof of ownership of copyright in computer
2.68 The Committee affirms its draft recommendation that a provision like the
proposed s.126A in clause 11 of the
introduced in respect of computer programs (paragraph 16.24).
2.69 The Committee also recommends that the extension of this provision to
all materials in computer readable form be considered as
part of any reference
to the Committee to review the Act (paragraph 16.24).
Privilege against self-incrimination
2.70 The Committee makes no recommendation on this issue (paragraph
Possession in the course of a business
2.71 In the Draft Report the Committee sought further comments on the
creation of a civil right of action by a copyright owner against
a person for
possession, for commercial purposes, of infringing copies of his or her works
known to be such, ie, a counterpart action
to the offence found in s.132(2A) of
the Act and whether the wider infringing activity of "possession in the course
of business"
(as in the UK) would be more appropriate. The Committee now
recommends that (paragraph 16.37):
(a) the Act be amended so that an employer will be guilty of an offence where
he or she is found in possession of an article which
he or she knew, or ought to
have reasonably known, is an infringing copy of a work;
(b) consistent with the Committee’s recommendation that software
penalties be brought into line with those applying in respect
of unauthorised
commercial copying of cinematographic films:
(i) a first offence be punishable with a fine not exceeding $1,500 for the
article, or for each article, to which the offence relates
or imprisonment for a
period not exceeding 2 years, or both; or if the person is a body
corporate—a fine not exceeding $7,500
for the article, or for each
article, to which the offence relates; and
(ii) for any subsequent offence a penalty not exceeding $50,000 for an
individual, or 5 years imprisonment, or both; or if the person
corporate—a fine not exceeding $250,000.
Anton Piller orders
2.72 The Committee makes no specific recommendation on this issue (paragraph
Program locks
2.73 The Committee recommends that the Act be amended to provide that
to prevent the
commercial manufacture, importation, distribution and possession for commercial
purposes of devices which are designed
to facilitate the unauthorised
circumvention of locks or other devices applied to protect computer programs
from unauthorised copying
(paragraph 16.42).
Penalties for criminal offences under the Act
2.74 The Committee endorses its draft recommendation that criminal penalties
for computer software piracy should be brought into line
with those currently
applying to films and proposed in the
recordings (paragraph 16.49).
Distribution of copyright materials via computer
bulletin board systems
2.75 The Committee recommends that if and when a new transmission right is
introduced into the Act by the Government, consideration
should be given to the
amendment of s.132 and more specifically s.132(5A) which concerns offences
arising from the transmission of
computer programs (paragraph 16.61).
2.76 The Committee recommends that the copyright issues raised by use of
bulletin board systems should be considered in the context
of the proposed
review of the Act (paragraph 16.65).
The Committee’s Draft Report and Relevant International
Developments
COURSE OF THE INQUIRY
3.01 The Committee advertised for submissions in February 1989. In April 1990
the Committee released an Issues Paper based on the
submissions received. A list
of the parties who made submissions appears in Appendix A. About 400 copies of
the Issues Paper were
distributed. In early July 1990 the Committee wrote to all
organisations and individuals who had made submissions, and other interested
parties, announcing its intention to hold public hearings in Sydney on 26 and 27
July 1990. The hearings were conducted in the Ground
Floor Theatrette, State
Office Block, 74-96 Phillip Street, Sydney. A list of those who made submissions
to the Committee at the
public hearings is to be found in Appendix B. At the
public hearings the Committee invited further submissions concerning issues
raised during the course of the hearings. A list of those organisations and
individuals that made submissions following the hearings
is contained in
Appendix C.
3.02 At the public hearings, IBM Australia Limited (IBM) offered to conduct a
demonstration of decompilation for the Committee. This
took place in Melbourne
on 22 November 1990. IBM insisted on the demonstration being conducted in
camera. The Committee agreed to
this request on the grounds that it should have
the benefit of the demonstration and that it has always observed requests for
submissions
to it to be treated on a confidential basis. Nevertheless, it would
have preferred to have been able to give other interests an opportunity
present, particularly those who advocate the introduction of a qualified right
to engage in reverse engineering and decompilation
of computer programs for
certain limited purposes. Having said this, the Committee acknowledges that IBM,
along with numbers of other
computer manufacturers and suppliers, has a
continuing anxiety about piracy. Any step at all which tends to facilitate
accessibility
to information about how a particular program operates is seen as
a threat to the program’s integrity. Experience shows that
these fears are
not without foundation.
3.03 On 7 February 1991, in response to IBM’s demonstration to the
Committee, a group of companies operating under the title
“Supporters of
Interoperable Products in Australia” (SISA) (listed in Appendix E) made a
presentation to the Committee.
They sought to demonstrate the importance of the
development of interoperable computer products and the concept of open systems.
The Committee was also requested to treat this demonstration on a confidential
3.04 Following this demonstration, the Committee visited Alcatel–STC
Australia Limited’s (Alcatel) electronic switching
design section in the
Sydney suburb of Alexandria. During this visit, Mr P Conrick, Manager of
Alcatel’s Patent Department,
made a short presentation to the Committee
concerning the industrial applications of computer programs in which he outlined
concerns over the current scope of protection afforded to
computer programs. Mr Conrick explained the operation of modern telephone
switching and communications equipment.
PUBLICATION OF DRAFT REPORT IN JUNE 1993
3.05Because of the extensive scope and highly technical nature of the
reference, the Committee decided that, before reporting to the
Minister, it
would release a Draft Report on its conclusions and proposed recommendations, to
afford interested parties an opportunity
to comment on those conclusions and
recommendations as well as suggest technical adjustments. The Draft Report was
released in June
1993; copies were distributed free of charge to those who had
made submissions to the Committee and other interested parties.
3.06The Committee was gratified to find that the Draft Report attracted
considerable interest both in Australia and internationally,
as reflected in the
range of persons and bodies making comments on the report. The Committee
received a total of 42 submissions on
the Draft Report from within Australia and
overseas; a list of the submissions is at Appendix D. The Committee records its
appreciation
of the efforts of those responsible for the submissions, which have
been fully taken into account by the Committee in preparing this
Final Report.
The Centre for International Research on Communication and Information
Technologies (CIRCIT), based in Victoria, convened
a series of seminars in
September 1993 on the main issues dealt with in the Draft Report, at which
speakers included the foremost
experts in Australia on the protection of
computer software. The Committee acknowledges the very valuable contribution
made by those
seminars to the review of its Draft Report.
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Prices Surveillance Authority Report on prices of
computer software
3.07 In September 1991, the then Minister Assisting the Treasurer, Mr Ross
Free MP, wrote to the Attorney-General suggesting that
the Prices Surveillance
Authority (PSA) should examine and report on the prices of computer programs. At
the invitation of the Attorney-General,
the Committee considered the proposal at
its meeting on 16 and 17 October 1991. The Chairman of the Committee wrote to
the Attorney-General
following the meeting to advise him that the Committee had
no objection to the proposed inquiry. The PSA released an interim report
October 1992. Its final report was published on 15 December 1992. The issue of
importation is considered in Chapter 11 of this
report. In reaching its
conclusions there the Committee has had regard to both the submissions it
received and the findings of the
PSA. As at the date of presentation of this
report, the Government had not made any formal response to the PSA's report.
The decision of the High Court in
3.08 In Australia, the principal legal development has been the decision of
the High Court in
[1992] HCA 2
1992) 173 CLR
Autodesk case
) concerning the infringement of
interpretation of the 1984 amendments
explicitly extending copyright protection to computer programs. The
ramifications of that decision for the industry are
still being worked out. On 5
August 1992, an application was made to the High Court to reopen the case. On 3
March 1993 the High
Court published its reasons for dismissing the application:
[1993] HCA 6
(1993) 176 CLR 300
Autodesk case
is considered at some length in Chapters 5 and 6.
Highways to Change
3.09On 7 January 1994, the Minister for Justice, the Hon. Duncan Kerr MP,
formed the Copyright Convergence Group (CCG) to inquire
into and report on
legislative reforms needed to the Act to adequately provide for new
communications technologies, such as satellite
and cable television services.
The CCG released an Issues Paper in June 1994 and also held public seminars to
discuss its Issues
Paper. Its final report,
Highways to
Change—Copyright in the New Communications Environment
number of recommendations which are intended to remedy the most urgent
deficiencies in the Act. The Government recently
announced in its Cultural
Policy Statement—Creative Nation that it accepts the recommendations of
the CCG. The Committee has
noted the recommendations of the CCG which affect
9 and 14 dealing with the exclusive rights of copyright owners.
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
3.10 Since the Committee received its reference, several important
developments have occurred internationally.
The European Union
3.11 The deliberations of the European Union (formerly the European
Community) have resulted in three directives and at least one
proposal which
directly affect the subject matter of the Committee’s reference. After
protracted negotiations over almost two
years, the Council of the European
Community (as it then was) issued on 14 May 1991 a
Directive on the Legal
Protection of Computer Programs
(Appendix G). All member states had until 1
January 1993 to comply with the Directive. On 19 November 1992, the Council
Directive on
Rental right and lending right and on certain rights
related to copyright in the field of intellectual property
. The implications
of this directive are discussed in Chapter 10. Again, on 4 October 1993, the
Council released its
Amended proposal for a Council Directive on the legal
protection of databases
. This proposal, which is understood to be presently
“under technical discussion”, is discussed in Chapter 14. Finally,
on 29 October 1993, the Council issued a Directive
Harmonising the term of
protection of copyright and certain related rights
; this is referred to in
Uruguay Round of GATT
3.12 On 15 December 1993 in Geneva representatives of the contracting states
party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
1947 agreed on the
Final Act embodying the results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade
Negotiations, which included an Agreement
on Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights, commonly referred to as the TRIPS Agreement. On 15
April 1994 at Marrakech,
Ministers representing the governments of those
countries formally signed the Final Act, which is expected to enter into force,
ratification, on 1 January 1995 or, failing that, 1 July 1995.
3.13 The TRIPS Agreement imposes obligations on more than 115 member
countries, including Australia, in relation to "Copyright and
Related Rights,
Trademarks, Geographical Indications, Industrial Designs, Patents,
Layout-Designs (Topographies) of Integrated Circuits,
Protection of Undisclosed
Information and Control of Anti-Competitive Practices in Contractual Licences"
(Part II). The Agreement
also imposes very extensive and detailed obligations in
relation to "Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights", including "General
Obligations, Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies, Provisional
Measures, Special Requirements Related to Border Measures
and Criminal
Procedures" (Part III).
3.14For the purposes of this report, the section of the TRIPS Agreement on
"Copyright and Related Rights" includes the requirement
that members comply with
articles 1–21 (except art.6
on moral rights) of the latest
(1971) Act of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
Works (Berne Convention)
(art.9(1)—Appendix O). Article 10(1) requires
Computer programs, whether in source or object code, shall be protected as
literary works under the Berne Convention (1971).
Article 10(2) requires in part that:
Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or other
form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement
of their contents
constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such . . .
Article 11 requires members to provide authors and their successors in title
. . . the right to authorise or prohibit the commercial rental to the public
of originals or copies of their copyright works.
which includes computer programs. Article 11 further provides that:
. . . this obligation does not apply to rentals where the program itself is
not the essential object of the rental.
Article 13 provides that:
Members shall confine limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights to
certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation
work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right
3.15Under the transitional arrangements provided for in the Agreement, member
countries have one year from the date of entry into
force of the Agreement
establishing the World Trade Organisation, which was also annexed to the Uruguay
Round Final Act, to apply
the obligations of the TRIPS Agreement. However, up to
an additional four years is allowed to members that are "developing countries"
and those that are (art.65(3)):
. . . in the process of transformation from a centrally-planned into a
market, free-enterprise economy and which [are] undertaking
structural reform of
[their] intellectual property system and facing special problems in the
preparation and implementation of intellectual
property laws.
3.16The TRIPS Agreement has been dealt with at some length here because of
the decisive impact it has on the range of options that
may be considered for
the protection of computer programs and computerised databases. This is apparent
from the very clear import
of articles 9 and 10. The full text of relevant
articles of the TRIPS Agreement is at Appendix O.
WIPO Committee of Experts on a Possible Protocol to
the Berne Convention
3.17 The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), which is
responsible for the administration of the Berne Convention, has
established a
Committee of Experts on a Possible Protocol to the Convention. Thus far, the
Committee has met three times in Geneva,
on 4–8 November 1991, 10–17
February 1992 and 21–25 June 1993. These three sessions have considered,
amongst other
matters, a draft proposal developed by WIPO for expressly
affirming that protection under the Convention extends to computer programs,
for extending protection to databases and other computer-stored works, and
expert systems. Following the second session, the
Assembly of the Berne Union
(the governing body established by the Convention), at a meeting in September
1992, resolved to omit
computer-produced works and expert systems from the terms
of reference of the Committee of Experts, evidently because of lack of
for their inclusion in the proposed Protocol. Following the third session of the
Committee, and the subsequent conclusion
of the TRIPS Agreement as part of the
Uruguay Round outcome, WIPO prepared a revised proposal for the Protocol for the
consideration
of the Committee at a session scheduled for June 1994. At an
extraordinary meeting on 28–29 April 1994, the Berne Union Assembly
resolved that the session should be deferred till December 1994. At the time of
presenting this report, the Australian Government
is understood to be engaged in
consultations with affected interests on the attitude to be adopted to the WIPO
"second generation"
proposal for the Protocol.
Washington Treaty on integrated circuits
3.18 On 26 May 1989, the Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of
Integrated Circuits (Washington Treaty) opened for signature
in Washington.
Although the Treaty was adopted by a substantial majority, as at 1 January 1994
it had been ratified by only one state
(Egypt) and therefore is not yet in
force. According to WIPO, there are interests in the states that produce the
majority of integrated
circuits that oppose the ratification of or accession to
the Treaty. This may explain the reluctance of other states to ratify a
which they see as having very little practical value without the membership of
those major producer states. According to representatives
Attorney-General’s Department, Australia has taken no action towards
accession pending the outcome of the GATT TRIPs
negotiations.
3.19As already mentioned (paragraphs 3.13–3.14 above), the TRIPS
Agreement imposes obligations on member countries in respect
“Layout-Designs (Topographies) of Integrated Circuits”. Article 35
of TRIPS requires members to provide protection
for layout-designs in accordance
with articles 2–7 of the Washington Treaty (except for articles 6(3)), 12
and 16(3)) of the
Washington Treaty), and articles 36–38 make further
provision regarding the scope of protection, acts not requiring the
authorisation
of the right holder and the term of protection.
3.20 Prior to the conclusion of the Washington Treaty, Australia enacted the
Circuit Layouts Act 1989
which provides protection for integrated
circuits in similar measure to that provided for under the Treaty. This
enactment secured
temporary protection for Australian integrated circuit layouts
under the United States
Semiconductor Chip Protection Act 1984.
Committee understands that the Attorney-General’s Department is of the
view that the
Circuit Layouts Act
satisfies the obligations
under articles 35–38 of TRIPS. On that basis, it seems reasonable to
expect that protection of Australian
layouts will be made permanent under the US
National developments in Australia’s trading
3.21 Several of Australia’s major trading partners have amended their
legislation with respect to the protection of computer
programs. For example, in
late 1988, the US acceded to the Berne Convention and amended its
to comply with its requirements (
Berne Convention
Implementation Act 1988
(PL 100–568)). In the same year, the United
Kingdom passed the
, which made
extensive provision for the protection of computer-related intellectual
property. In 1990, the UK passed its
Computer Misuse Act 1990
amongst other matters, creates criminal penalties where there has been an
unauthorised reproduction of programs or data. Japan,
Canada, Indonesia, Taiwan,
and several European States have also made changes to their laws. In July 1994 a
bill was introduced into
the New Zealand Parliament to replace the existing
, so as to implement the requirements of TRIPS,
including explicit protection of computer programs as literary works. No doubt
are other changes to national legislation that have escaped the
Committee’s notice.
Threatened unilateral action by the United
3.22Under the US
Trade Act 1974
, as amended by the
Omnibus Trade
and Competitiveness Act 1988
, the US Trade Representative must annually
identify countries that deny “adequate and effective” intellectual
protection and “fair and equitable” market access to US
businesses that depend on intellectual property protection. Countries
have the most unacceptable standards are designated “priority foreign
countries” and investigated for possible
trade sanctions under
“special” s.301 of the
Trade Act 1974
. A middle tier, the
“priority watch list”, is reserved for countries whose regimes need
careful monitoring. Those countries
presenting the least concern are cited as
“watch list” countries.
3.23On 30 April 1994, the US Trade Representative announced the listings
following the latest annual review. Australia, which had
previously been on the
“priority watch list”, was transferred to the watch list. This
evidently reflected satisfaction
by the US Government with the making of
regulations in April 1994 extending performers’ protection under the
Australian Copyright
Act to US nationals and residents. The Committee understood
that one of the reasons for Australia’s previous inclusion in the
“priority watch list” was the concern of the US Government that the
Committee might recommend weakening protection for
computer software. The
Committee notes that the decision to include Australia in the “priority
watch list” in 1993, announced
in April 1993, preceded the release of the
Committee’s Draft Report in June 1993. The Committee would like to think
Draft Report, providing authoritative documentation of the
Committee’s views, served to reassure the US Government and remove
misapprehension that it might have previously had about the Committee’s
intentions. In any case, as the Committee understands
has been made clear to the
US Government, the Committee’s views will not, by themselves, bring about
any change in the law:
implementation of any of the Committee’s
recommendations would require a Government decision to adopt them and then
of implementing legislation through the Parliament.
3.24The Committee notes a report in
(23 May 1994) that Japan,
which was included in the “priority watch list” announced by the US
Trade Representative on
30 April 1994, was so listed because of, inter alia,
“possible weakening of copyright protection for computer programs”.
The attention of the Committee had been drawn to press reports to the effect
that an advisory council established in July 1993 by
the Japanese Cultural
Affairs Agency was understood to have been inclined towards recommending
adoption of a broad right to decompile
computer programs, and that officials of
the US Trade Representative had expressed great concern at this possibility.
3.25In June 1994, a representative of the Copyright Division of the Japanese
Agency for Cultural Affairs provided the Australian Government
with a copy of a
summary of the “Report of the Consultative Committee on Copyright Issues
Relating to Computer Programs”
dated 30 May 1994. On the matter of
“Research and analysis of existing computer programs”, the summary
records that “the
Committee could not reach a conclusion proposing a
specific revision of the Copyright Law at this stage”. It went on:
The Committee considers it appropriate to trust in the developments of case
law and legal theory on the interpretation of the present
provisions, and to
reexamine this issue in the light of future national and international
developments.
The Form of Protection and the Subject Matter to be
CURRENT FORM OF PROTECTION
4.01 One of the fundamental questions which needs to be answered by the
Committee is the form of protection of computer programs which
is to be adopted.
At the moment the principal existing protection which is conferred is to be
found in the
particularly since the
coming into force of the amendments made to the Act by the
Amendment Act 1984
. However, the Act is not the only relevant statute. Some
reference needs also to be made to the
Patents Act 1990
Layouts Act 1989
Designs Act 1906
. Of relevance also is the
law relating to confidential information and passing off and, in that latter
respect, Part V of the
Trade Practices Act 1974
However, the Committee
is focusing its attention on the
4.02 A question which is raised for discussion from time to time in the
relevant literature is whether copyright protection is appropriate.
protection which is afforded by the Act is protection which is based upon
computer programs being, or being treated as, literary
works. It would be
possible to devise a form of protection which would treat computer programs as
if they were appropriately the
subject of protection by copyright legislation
but, instead of treating them as works, treating them as subject matter in the
way as are films, sound recordings, sound broadcasts and published
editions; see Part IV of the Act. It would also be possible to
devise a form of
protection which was not based on any existing regime but was special to the
nature of computer programs. In the
language of some of the commentators it
sui generis
form of protection, such as has been afforded to
integrated circuit layout-designs under the
Circuit Layouts Act 1989
1984 Amendments to the Act
4.03 The 1984 amendments to the Act extended the definition of
“literary work” so as to include within it computer programs
(s.10(1)). Amendments were made to s.10(1) adding new definitions or modifying
existing definitions designed to ensure that there
was a comprehensive set of
provisions having the effect of protecting computer programs as literary works.
These amendments are discussed
in detail in Chapter 6.
4.04 Part III of the
Act, which deals with works (literary, dramatic,
musical and artistic) and so much of Part IV of the Act as deals with films,
with some other provisions of the Act, give effect to Australia’s
obligations as a member of the Berne Convention for the Protection
of Literary
and Artistic Works (Paris Act, 1971) (Berne Convention), to earlier Acts of
which Australia has been a party in its own
right since 1928. In its Draft
Report the Committee noted that if computer programs were literary works within
the Berne Convention,
Australia had an obligation to protect them as such and to
ensure that that protection was in accordance with the requirements of
Convention. The Draft Report further noted that if computer programs were not in
truth literary works but were simply treated
as if they were (in other words
deemed to be literary works), then there was no obligation to give them the
protection for which
the Berne Convention provided. An analysis of the decisions
of the Australian courts and a consideration of the relevant technology
suggested to the Committee that, whilst some computer programs were in truth
literary works, some might not be. More specifically,
the majority of the
Committee concluded that computer programs were literary works in the
conventional sense when they were expressed
in some forms but might not be
literary works when they were expressed in others. The Draft Report then set out
(paragraphs 4.05–4.20)
the Committee’s analysis of the applicability
of the Berne Convention to computer programs in their various forms.
TRIPS Agreement
4.05 As noted in Chapter 3, since the release of the Draft Report, the TRIPS
Agreement has been concluded as part of the Final Act
of the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade negotiations. The Final Act was agreed on in December 1993 by
more than 115 countries,
including Australia, and signed by ministers of these
governments in April 1994. The Committee understands that Australia will ratify
the Uruguay Round Final Act, of which the Agreement Establishing the World Trade
Organisation will, on entering into force, trigger
the commencement of the
period (of 1 year in the case of Australia and other developed countries) within
which the obligations under
the TRIPS Agreement will have to be implemented.
Article 10(1) of TRIPS, as noted in paragraph 3.14, provides:
Computer programs, whether in source or object code, shall be protected as
literary works under the Berne Convention (1971).
It seems to the Committee that, whatever might have been the extent of the
applicability of the Berne Convention as a result of its
analysis in the Draft
Report, the obligations being undertaken by Australia under the TRIPS Agreement
put an end to all argument
by emphatically requiring all forms of computer
programs to be protected as literary works. With very few notable exceptions the
industrialised and very many of the developing countries of the world will take
on the same obligations (the Committee understands
that China, Russia and
Taiwan, being 3 conspicuous non-members of the GATT, are actively negotiating
admission to the GATT with a
view to becoming original adherents to the Uruguay
Round and, thus, TRIPS).
4.06 In its discussion in the Draft Report (paragraphs 4.21–4.27) of
alternative forms of protection of computer programs to
treatment as a literary
work, the Committee expressed a preference for introduction of
went on to conclude that such a change would risk contravention
of existing
obligations under the Berne Convention, inconsistency with the approach of
Australia's major trading partners and possible
damage to trading relationships
that the change might cause. Comments made on the Draft Report characterised the
Committee’s
conclusion as "an unfortunate failure of conviction". The
matter is foreclosed by the subsequent conclusion of the TRIPS Agreement.
Nevertheless, in deference to those who made submissions querying the
suitability of copyright as the most appropriate form of protection,
Committee has retained in this report, in the paragraphs immediately following,
the analysis that it made and the conclusions
it reached regarding the case for
patent protection as well as for a
sui generis
form of protection for
computer programs.
POSSIBLE FORMS OF PROTECTION OTHER THAN
4.07 In earlier years it was not uncommon to find support for a regime of
protection which, if not pure patent protection, was a patent-type
protection.
So far as the Committee was able to ascertain there was in the submissions made
to it very little, if any, support for
such an approach. If one were to
contemplate it, it would seem that protection would be afforded only where there
was an invention.
For a program to be protected in this way, it, or at least
some substantial features of it, would need to amount to an invention.
particular it would be necessary to show that it was novel, not obvious and
involved an inventive step (
Patents Act 1990
Most computer
programs would not meet these criteria, and yet much skill and effort may go
into the writing of programs with the
consequence that they will reflect a high
degree of originality. Patent-type protection would have the important public
of requiring disclosure in return for the monopoly which would be
granted, but it would have a number of disadvantages not the least
would be the time taken to prepare and lodge for registration an appropriate
specification and to have it examined by the
Patent Office. Copyright or
There is not the uncertainty
which prevails in relation to patents particularly
between the date of the invention and the date when the application is lodged
Report of the Office of Technology Assessment of the United States
(1992), pp. 30–31).
4.08 The Committee did not therefore regard as adequate, or support, the
development of patent or patent-type protection. It should,
however, be
mentioned in passing that patent protection is available in Australia in some
cases. In the Draft Report the Committee
noted that patent offices both here and
overseas have approved specifications in which the invention is a concept or an
idea. Indeed
the Committee notes a recent review of software protection in the
US that states that between 1972–1992 over 23 000 patents
for software
were issued (
Computer Law and Practice
, Vol 10, No. 4, 1994, p.133). In
Australia the present position is that copyright protection is available to
protect original forms
of expression and patent protection to protect an idea or
concept which has been found to be sufficiently inventive. An example is
provided by the decision of Burchett J of the Federal Court in
International
Business Machines Corporation
Commissioner of Patents
[1991] FCA 625
(1991) 33 FCR
). An appeal against the decision was
4.09 A review of the history of possible patent protection for computer
programs was recently made by the full Federal Court in

Jiejing Pty Ltd & Ors (

court referred to the position in the UK and in Australia as a result of the
decision in the
, referred to in paragraph 4.08. The significant
aspect of this later decision is the statement by the Court that computer
are not expressly excluded from patent protection by the
Patents Act
(or the 1952 Act) and that computer programs can be patentable
inventions if they disclose “a manner of manufacture” as
required by
Patents Act 1990
. In the course of their joint
judgement, Spender, Gummow and Heerey JJ noted that, unlike s.1(2)(c) of the UK
Patents Act 1977
, which expressly states that a program for a computer is
not an invention and therefore not patentable, the Australian
Patents Act
does not expressly exclude computer programs from qualifying for
protection. In the particular case before them, concerning a word
program that assembled text in Chinese language characters, the Court found that
it should not have been denied patent
protection on the ground that it was not a
“manner of manufacture”.
Sui generis
4.10 In 1977 the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), evidently
concluding that copyright protection was inappropriate
for computer software,
Model Provisions on the Protection of Computer Software
Industrial Property
265) which proposed a
sui generis
of protection. The model provisions contained definitions of “computer
program”, “program description”,
“supporting
material”, “computer software” and “proprietor”.
“Computer program” was
defined to mean:
a set of instructions capable, when incorporated in a machine-readable
medium, of causing a machine having information-processing
capabilities to
indicate, perform or achieve a particular function, task or result.
“Computer software” was defined to mean any or several of the
items “computer program”, “program description”
“supporting material”.
Section 2(1)
provided that the rights which
were conferred in respect of computer software should belong to the person who
created it except where
it was created by an employee in the course of his
employment, in which case the rights, subject to a contrary agreement, were to
belong to the employer.
provided for originality and s.4 said that the
rights conferred should not extend to the concepts on which the software was
dealt with the rights of the proprietor,
with infringement
with the duration of the rights which would be conferred.
provided that, subject to paragraph (b), the rights should expire at the
end of a period of 20 years calculated from the earlier
of two dates, namely,
the date when the program was first used and the date when the software was
first sold, leased or licensed.
Section 7(2)(b)
provided that the rights
conferred should in no case extend beyond 25 years from the time that the
software was created. Section
8 dealt with relief—injunction and
damages—and
dealt with the application of other laws. The purpose of
was to make it clear that it would be permissible for members of the Union
to confer additional protection on computer programs by
the application of the
general principles of law or of any other law such as patent law, copyright law
or the law on unfair competition.
4.11 The Model Provisions failed to gain acceptance as countries increasingly
turned to copyright as the preferred form of protection
for software. It is
clear that, if they had been adopted, it would have been possible for there to
be much more flexibility in the
protection of computer programs than is
presently the case. Laws could have been made with special regard to the nature
of computer
programs. They would not have been lumped in with other literary
works and thus governed by general provisions which, in many respects,
appropriate.
4.12 The foregoing discussion would suggest that, if one were to devise a
sui generis
regime of protection, a copyright-type approach would seem to
be the preferable option. Copyright protects forms of expression, but
It is clear that the essence of a computer program in whatever code it is
expressed is its form. That is where its originality
is to be found. It may
be—indeed it will usually be the case—that the form of expression
will have been devised in order
to give effect to an original idea or concept,
perhaps an algorithm, which the author had. But it is the form of expression
will enable that idea or concept to be realised. However, it is not the
idea or concept which ought to be the subject of protection
unless it meets the
criteria which must be present for the grant of letters patent for an invention.
To protect an idea or concept
which does not meet these criteria would amount to
conferring on the author a monopoly, which would prevent others having a similar
idea or concept from developing a program to achieve it. It would be manifestly
contrary to the public interest to confer such wide
protection. An
author’s creativity will be sufficiently protected and rewarded by
ensuring that the form of expression which
has been used is not infringed by
another program which is in whole or in substantial measure a reproduction of
that of the author.
PREFERENCE FOR COPYRIGHT PROTECTION FOR COMPUTER
4.13 Treating computer programs as literary works under copyright law does
not appear to the Committee to give rise to any matter
of serious contention, at
least in the industry. That approach found broad agreement and support in the
various submissions which
the Committee received. In summary those submissions
completion of formalities or a high degree of novelty or originality (obtaining
protection is therefore inexpensive);
there is a substantial body of case law relating to works
which can appropriately be applied to resolve issues relating to computer
is expressed. Accordingly, copyright protection does not prevent the
independent
development of other forms of expression of the same idea; and
programs overseas. It is important that Australia, from a trade perspective,
a protection regime for programs which is compatible with those of its major
trading partners.
The entry into force of the TRIPS Agreement, with more than
115 adherents, will put this beyond debate.
The bulk of submissions received by the Committee advocated or assumed that
the protection afforded computer programs would be a copyright
protection. But they were not, at least in most cases, concerned whether
programs were to be protected as literary works
or as some other form of subject
matter. What most, but not all, contended was that the form of protection should
be a copyright
form of protection rather than a patent-like form of protection
or some other and new form of protection. The industry has become
would be likely to create a good deal of uncertainty
when, despite difficulties
here and there, there is a common understanding and approach not only in
Australia but in other countries
as well. All these considerations led the
Committee to conclude, in its Draft Report, that the optimum form of protection
was copyright
and, further, the removal of computer programs from
and their placement in
as a separate category of
subject matter. Because of the imperative of art.10 of TRIPS, the last mentioned
conclusion preferring
sui generis
literary works is no longer sustainable.
4.14 In its Draft Report, even though it was before TRIPS had been finalised,
the Committee concluded that it should not recommend
sui generis
protection, despite its evident advantages compared with literary work
protection. Because of the comments made suggesting that
sui generis
protection should not have been rejected, the Committee thinks that it should
recall the reasons given in the Draft Report for doing
so. First and foremost,
for reasons given in paragraphs 4.05–4.20 in the Draft Report, adoption of
sui generis
protection would place Australia in breach of its obligations
under the Berne Convention. Equally importantly it would involve
Australia’s
form of protection being out of step with that conferred in a
number of major countries which include those with whom Australia has
substantial trading links. There were (and still are) very strong views held in
the United States and the European Union that protection
of computer programs as
literary works is the appropriate form of protection. It seemed to the Committee
that this view was entrenched
and, at least in the medium term, was unlikely to
change. The conclusion of TRIPS seems to have reinforced that prediction. The
thought that adoption of its preferred option would not have been
welcomed in a number of other countries important to Australia’s
and trading interests and might, however erroneously, have caused some to have
misgivings about Australia’s commitment
to the proper protection of
computer programs. Australia has a computer program industry of its own but it
is still developing and
it is not particularly substantial, notwithstanding the
promise which it has. Australia is a net importer of computers and computer
programs. That situation will continue for the foreseeable future. What needs to
be stressed is that Australia needs technology of
all kinds for its continuing
development. It must have access to overseas sources for this, not only for the
purposes of its own
computer industry, but also for a vast number of other
purposes, many of them far more important than the support and development
that industry. Governments, government agencies, educational institutions and
the broad range of commercial and industrial undertakings
all require access to
the latest computer technology for their efficient operation and development.
These considerations suggested
to the Committee that Australia should retain,
although with some amendments, the form of protection which it adopted in 1984.
Committee remains of this view and recommends that computer programs
continue to be protected by the Act as literary works (Recommendation
4.15 While the Committee has now concluded that there is an unambiguous
requirement under art.10 of TRIPS to protect computer programs
as literary works
under the Berne Convention, that does not dispose of the need to consider the
most appropriate way of implementing
this obligation in legislation, as is
evident from the discussion in succeeding chapters. On the one hand, the US, so
the Committee
understands, strongly favours leaving the application of literary
work protection to computer programs to the courts, ie. only minimal
legislative
adaptation of literary work protection to the unique features of computer
programs. On the other hand, art.1(1) of the
Directive on the Legal
Protection of Computer Programs
, which requires their protection as literary
works within the meaning of the Berne Convention, includes a number of
provisions specifying
the manner of protection and exceptions to such
protection. The application of the Berne Convention itself to computer programs
currently one of the items on the agenda of the Committee of Experts
considering a possible protocol to the Convention. So while
the conclusion of
the TRIPS Agreement and its intended adoption by Australia may have determined
the issue of the basic form of protection
of computer programs in favour of
resolution of
many issues—of which some have considerable commercial
implications—attributable to the distinctive nature of computer
compared with what may be called conventional literary works.
PROTECTION OF “LOOK AND FEEL” OF
COMPUTER PROGRAMS
4.16 It remains to mention two questions which relate to the subsistence of
in the computer
jargon “look and feel” of a program. Both these matters will be
dealt with in Chapters 14 and 6 respectively,
but in relation to “look and
feel” the following points may be noted. “Look and feel”
involves two matters
which may relate to each other or overlap. First there is
the user interface. This will usually, but not always, concern screen displays.
There is a view that some screen displays or some parts of them may be
registrable as an industrial design. An objection to this
is that what appears
on the screen is transitory or ephemeral so that it does not take a permanent
form. Such an objection was upheld
by a delegate of the Registrar of Designs in
Re Applications by Comshare Inc.
[1991] ADO 2
(1991) 23 IPR 145.
Secondly, there is
what has become described as the “sequence, structure and
organisation” of a program. This relates
to the way in which a program is
organised and structured. The question is whether the author of a program should
have an exclusive
right in relation to its organisation and structure. This may
involve more extensive protection than would be conferred by protecting
form in which a program is expressed. The competing views which are in play are
well discussed in two decisions of the United
States Court of Appeals, namely,
the decision of the Third Circuit in
Whelan Associates
Jaslow Dental
[1986] USCA3 976
797 F.2d 1222
(3rd Cir. 1986) and the decision of the Second
Computer Associates International Inc.
23 IPR 385.
4.17 The United States decisions were given in the context of a statute which
confers conventional copyright protection in respect
of computer programs. The
Committee needs to make recommendations, firstly on the question of what
protection ought to be conferred
in relation to screen displays and the
sequence, structure and organisation of programs, and then whether the measure
of protection
which it recommends needs to be conferred by special provisions of
the legislation additional to those which will protect the form
of the language
or code in which programs are expressed.
Recent History of Australian Law
5.01 Computer programs are currently protected in Australia as literary works
(the Act). In 1984 the Act was amended to
make express provision for the protection of computer programs. The
Amendment Act 1984
amended the definitions in s.10(1) of “literary
work” and “adaptation” and added new definitions for
program” and “material form” as follows:
literary work
” includes:
(a) a table, or compilation, expressed in words, figures or symbols (whether
or not in a visible form); and
(b) a computer program or compilation of computer programs.
(ba) in relation to a literary work being a computer program—a version
of the work (whether or not in the language, code or
notation in which the work
was originally expressed) not being a reproduction of the work.
computer program
” means an expression, in
any language, code or notation, of a set of instructions (whether with or
without related information)
intended, either directly or after either or both
of the following:
(a) conversion to another language, code or notation;
(b) reproduction in a different material form,
to cause a device having digital information processing capabilities to
perform a particular function.
material form
”, in relation to a work or
an adaptation of a work, includes any form (whether visible or not) of storage
from which the work
or adaptation, or a substantial part of the work or
adaptation, can be reproduced.
THE POSITION BEFORE THE 1984 AMENDMENTS
The Apple case
5.02 The 1984 amendments, set out above, were enacted following the first
instance decision in the Federal Court in
Apple Computer Inc
Computer Edge Pty Ltd
(1983) 50 ALR 581
The intent of the
legislature in passing the amendments was to make it clear that computer
programs, whether in source or object
code, are literary works within the
meaning of the Act. The case went on appeal to the full Federal Court and
subsequently to the
High Court. Although the High Court handed down its decision
Computer Edge Pty Ltd
Apple Computer Inc
[1986] HCA 19
(1986) 161 CLR 171
) after the amendments, it interpreted the Act in
its form prior to the 1984 amendments. The substance of the High Court’s
summarised in the Committee’s Issues Paper (April 1990), is as
5.03 The US company, Apple, marketed computers in Australia. Their computers
were operated by an object code program stored in a ROM.
The program was a
systems program which, when the computer was switched on, caused it to take the
action that the program was designed
to achieve. The systems program was derived
from a program in source code. However, before the source program could be used
computer it had to be converted into a program in object code by another
5.04. The defendant, an Australian company, imported Wombat computers. These
contained a program in object code, stored in a ROM,
which had been copied from
the Apple programs in object code. The making of these object code programs did
not necessarily involve
converting the Apple object code back to its source code
5.05 The majority of the High Court, in ruling in favour of the defendant,
(a) programs written in source code were literary works for the purposes of
(b) programs in object code, in that they consisted of electrical impulses
which could not be perceived by the senses and were not
intended to convey any
message to a human being and did not represent words, letters, figures or
symbols, were not literary works;
(c) programs in object code were not translations or other adaptations of the
programs in source code for the following differing
an adaptation must be a “work” and the object code
programs were not;
• object code programs were not a reproduction or a
“translation” of the source codes within paragraph (c)(i) of
definition of “adaptation” in s.10(1), but rather the outcome of the
action taken in compliance with information
conveyed by the source programs;
• “translation” in that definition meant the action or
process of turning from one language into another and not
the expression or
rendering of something in another medium or form;
• reproduction requires two elements:
(i) the infringing work must sufficiently resemble the copyright
work—this element requires a degree of objective similarity
between the
two works; and
(ii) the infringing work must be produced by the use of the copyright work;
The Committee notes that the majority (3:2) decision of the High Court,
namely, that copyright did not protect an operating system
program in object
code stored in ROM chip, is limited in its practical application to programs
copied prior to the 1984 amendments.
provides, in effect, that where, by virtue of amendments made by that
Act, copyright subsists in a computer program made before its
commencement,
nothing done before its commencement in relation to the computer program shall
be taken to be an infringement of that
the amendments made by the
applying to acts
done in relation to computer programs before its commencement that were not
infringements before that date.
THE POSITION SINCE THE 1984 AMENDMENTS
The Autodesk case
5.06 The scope of copyright protection for computer programs since the 1984
amendments has received extensive judicial consideration
in the case of
Autodesk Inc
Martin Dyason and others
. The decision at first
instance ((1989)
[1989] FCA 295
went on appeal to the full Federal Court ((1990)
[1990] FCA 469
18 IPR 109)
and subsequently to the High Court. The High Court’s
decision was handed down on 12 February 1992 ((No 1)
[1992] HCA 2
(1992) 173 CLR 330
Autodesk case
). An application to the High Court to review its
decision was refused (
Autodesk Inc
Martin Dyason and others
[1993] HCA 6
(1993) 176 CLR 300
25 IPR 33).
5.07 The facts of the
Autodesk case
can be briefly stated as follows.
Autodesk produced and marketed a computer package called AutoCAD, designed to
assist in architectural
and engineering drafting. Supplied to purchasers with
each copy of the program was a hardware lock. Purchasers of the program were
permitted by Autodesk to make additional copies of the program if they wished to
do so. However, a sub-program in the program called
would, while the program was running, send a series of impulses to the lock. If
no response was received to
these impulses the program would cease to run.
Widget C operated by comparing the responses it received from the AutoCAD lock
a table of 127 responses stored in memory (termed a “look-up
table”). This meant that the AutoCAD program could only
run on machines
fitted with the AutoCAD lock.
5.08 Mr Kelly, an electronics designer, studied the operation of the AutoCAD
lock using an oscilloscope and, with the other defendants,
produced and marketed
a device called the Autokey lock. The Autokey lock enabled a purchaser to use
the AutoCAD program or a copy
of it on a computer without an AutoCAD lock.
Autodesk sought to restrain the defendants from producing and marketing the
locks by alleging, amongst other things, that the Autokey lock infringed
their copyright in the AutoCAD program and the AutoCAD lock.
5.09 At first instance the Federal Court (Northrop J) found that both the
AutoCAD lock and the Autokey lock were computer programs
within the meaning of
the Act. His Honour also found that both locks performed the same function.
Having regard to the word “function”
in the definition of computer
program, his Honour concluded that, in determining whether there was a
reproduction of the AutoCAD
lock by the Autokey lock, the function of the locks
should be taken into consideration. Accordingly, his Honour held that the
lock reproduced the AutoCAD lock.
5.10 On appeal, the full Federal Court found that the combination of the
Widget C program and the AutoCAD lock could together be regarded
as a computer
program. The Court also noted that the only similarity between the Autokey lock
and the Widget C–AutoCAD lock
was their function. However, the Court
rejected the approach adopted by Northrop J, in determining whether there had
been a reproduction
of the Widget C–AutoCAD lock. The functional
similarity between Widget C–AutoCAD and the Autokey lock was achieved by
using two completely different algorithms. Accordingly, the Court held that the
Autokey lock was neither a reproduction nor an adaptation
of the Widget
C–AutoCAD lock program, reversing Northrop J’s decision.
5.11 The decision of the full Federal Court was overturned by the High Court.
The High Court held that the AutoCAD program was a compilation
of computer
programs which included Widget C. The “look-up table” of 127
responses stored in the Widget C program was
regarded by the High Court as a
substantial part of the Widget C program. The Court held that Mr Kelly had
indirectly copied the
look-up table, and therefore that the 127 responses stored
in the Autokey lock infringed copyright in the Widget C program.
5.12 Following the High Court’s decision in the
Autodesk case
the respondent, Dyason, sought to have the judgment vacated on the basis that he
had not been heard on the following issues:
(a) whether the 127-bit series embedded in the EPROM in the Autokey lock
constituted a reproduction of a substantial part of Widget
C, namely, the
look-up table stored in Widget C;
(b) whether the third respondent indirectly copied the look-up table in
Widget C by copying the sequence of numbers generated by the
AutoCAD lock;
(c) whether copying data contained in a computer program can constitute a
reproduction of a substantial part of that computer program.
In essence the court was being asked to decide whether they had heard
arguments to the effect that the look-up table in Widget C did
not amount to a
set of instructions (ie, a computer program) but was simply data and that the
look-up table was not a substantial
part of the Widget C program. A majority of
the court (Brennan, Dawson and Gaudron JJ; Mason CJ and Deane J dissenting)
no rehearing should be allowed because they were satisfied that
arguments on these matters had been made. Both the judgements of
Gaudron JJ refer to the arguments made in the lower courts and in the High Court
which support this conclusion.
5.13 The High Court’s decision in the
since been applied by the Federal Court in
Accounting Systems 2000
(Developments) Pty Ltd
CCH Australia Ltd
(1993) 114 ALR 355
relation to the fundamental issues of copyright protection for computer
programs. The
remains the leading case in Australia
in relation to copyright protection of computer programs and some of the issues
raised by the
decisions of the High Court and the Federal Court are discussed
The scope of protection of computer
5.14 The issue of whether the AutoCAD program in source code or object code
was a computer program under the Act and protected by
contested before the High Court. However, Mason CJ, Brennan and Dean JJ did
discuss the scope of protection afforded
to computer programs by the definition
of “computer program” introduced by the 1984 amendments. They
referred to the
possibility that a narrow literal construction could be given to
the definition of computer program, with the result that copyright
protect a computer program unless it was in some form of written expression.
They rejected that construction however, stating
[1992] HCA 2
(173 CLR 330
[1992] HCA 2
That narrow literal construction would, however, partly frustrate the obvious
legislative intent to confer real protection upon the
actual set of instructions
regardless of whether they be actually expressed in written form or merely
embedded or stored in a non-sensate
form such as electrical impulses on a disk,
ROM or EPROM.
Their Honours continued
[1992] HCA 2
(173 CLR 330
[1992] HCA 2
. . . the reference to “an expression, in any language, code or
notation” should not be understood as referring only to
an actual written
expression or representation of a set of instructions with the result that
such a written expression actually exists
or has existed . . .
Their Honours indicated that the protection afforded to the set of
instructions under the s.10(1) definition is done in a way that
is adapted to
the nature of copyright. Accordingly, they held that
[1992] HCA 2
(173 CLR 330
[1992] HCA 2
. . . the stored set of instructions in a non-sensate form such as electrical
impulses is itself protected on the basis that copyright
actually subsists in
any expression or description of it which can theoretically be made in language,
code or notation.
It is clear from this discussion that a majority of the Court was of the view
that the definition of computer program in s.10(1) itself
extends protection to
computer programs in both source and object code.
5.15 In the
Autodesk case
(No 2) Mason CJ referred to the two
fundamental principles which the
Autodesk case
(No 1) had confirmed. The
first of those being that the definition of “computer program”
confers protection on the set
of instructions itself, the program, and not just
the method of storage of those instructions chosen by the author.
The definition of “computer
5.16 The full Federal Court in the
Autodesk case
considered the
meaning of the definition of computer program in s.10(1) of the Act.
Sheppard J, with whose reasoning Lockhart J agreed,
expressed the view that
the governing word in the definition of computer program is the word
“expression”. His Honour
noted that the definition includes a
reference to “reproduction in a different material form” and that
form” is defined in s.10(1) of the Act as including:
any form (whether visible or not) of storage from which the work or
adaptation can be reproduced.
Having regard to this definition Sheppard J considered that a set of
instructions would be a computer program within the meaning of
the Act if:
the set of instructions is reproduced in a form of storage in
a device having digital information processing capabilities; and
it causes the device to perform a particular function.
This reasoning was applied by Davies J in
Star Micronics Pty Ltd
Five Star Computers Pty Ltd
(1990) 18 IPR 225
, in which he held that a
computer program embodied in a ROM was a computer program for the purposes of
5.17 In the High Court’s decision in the
Autodesk case
indicated there was no need for the Court to suggest a particular test for
determining what is a computer program within
the meaning of the definition.
The meaning of “reproduction”
5.18 The meaning of reproduction is not defined in the Act. As discussed in
paragraphs 5.10 to 5.11, Northrop J’s findings in
Autodesk case
that both the AutoCAD lock and the Autokey lock were computer programs and
that the Autokey lock reproduced the AutoCAD lock were
rejected by the full
Federal Court and the High Court.
5.19 In the decision of the full Federal Court, Lockhart J, when considering
whether the Autokey lock reproduced the Widget C–AutoCAD
lock program, had
regard to the essential ingredients of reproduction identified by the High Court
the High Court held that the
Wombat object programs were not reproductions of the Apple source programs.
Gibbs CJ and Brennan in
their judgements referred to the requirement that
the infringing work sufficiently resemble the copyright work. Brennan J stated
[1986] HCA 19
(161 CLR 171
[1986] HCA 19
The notion of reproduction still connotes a resemblance between the work in
which copyright subsists and the work which is copied
from. The material form to
which the respective works are reduced need not be the same, but if the forms
are so dissimilar as to
deny resemblance between the works, one cannot be said
to be a reproduction of the other.
5.20 Applying the
Apple case,
Lockhart J concluded that there was a
fundamental difficulty in finding reproduction on the facts of the case. His
Honour held that,
in the absence of a sufficient degree of objective similarity
between the copyright work and the infringing work, the conclusion
had been a reproduction could not be sustained.
5.21 Sheppard J considered the significance of the words “to perform a
particular function” in the definition in s.10(1)
and whether, as Northrop
J had concluded, function should be taken into consideration in determining if
there was a sufficient degree
of similarly between the two locks. His Honour
concluded that the drafter of the definition of “computer program”
concerned to make it clear that the initial words “expression... of a
set of instructions” meant that there had to be
the expression of a set of
instructions which caused a device having digital information processing
capabilities to perform a particular
function. The reference in the definition
to causing a device having digital information processing capabilities to
perform a particular
function was intended to qualify only the words, “set
of instructions”, and did no more than set the limits of what it
the set of instructions applied to. For this reason his Honour declined to
follow the approach adopted by Northrop J.
5.22 In the High Court, Dawson J (with whom the other Judges agreed) held
that the fact both locks produced the same output in response
to a challenge
(from the Widget C program) and performed the same function did not mean that
there was any similarity between the
two sets of instructions. His Honour also
held that placing such significance on the function of the two locks, as
Northrop J had,
disregarded the traditional dichotomy in the law of copyright
between an idea and the expression of an idea.
5.23 In determining whether or not there had been a reproduction of the
AutoCAD lock, Dawson J made the following observation
[1992] HCA 2
(173 CLR 330
[1992] HCA 2
In the present case there can be no doubt about the originality of authorship
of the look-up table expressed as it is in Widget C.
But no reliance was placed
upon it as a literary work in itself. It is enough that it forms a substantial
part of a computer program
which is a literary work in itself . . .
This was one of the reasons given by Dawson J for concluding that the
production of the Autokey lock constituted an infringement of
the copyright in
the AutoCAD program, in particular Widget C.
5.24 If the reasoning applied by Dawson J is of general application and not
confined to the facts of the
Autodesk case
(the Committee is not aware of
any reason why it should be so confined), it follows that other things which may
not qualify for separate
protection under the Act as computer programs may
nonetheless be protected if they can properly be characterised as a substantial
part of a computer program. For example a screen display that is the user
interface of an otherwise original program, but which has
been designed to
resemble the screen display of another program, may infringe copyright in that
other computer program even though
the actual instructions of the
“look-alike” program that generate the particular display are
5.25 The conclusion that the look-up table was a substantial part of the
Widget C program, with the result that copying of the look-up
table constituted
copying of that program, causes the Committee some concern. Further, the
conclusion that the creation of the look-up
table in Autokey from observation of
the operation of Widget C and the AutoCAD lock was a copying of the look-up
table in Widget
C, even though the maker of Autokey (Mr Kelly) never saw that
table, is also viewed by the Committee as a far-reaching and questionable
extension of copyright. The Committee notes that Mason CJ as part of the
minority in the
Autodesk case
(No 2) was prepared to reopen judgement,
because he thought that it was arguable that the look-up table may have been
simply data
and not a substantial part of the program, and that these issues had
not been raised in argument. As already noted (paragraphs 3.08
and 5.06), the
majority of the High Court rejected an application that the decision should be
reviewed. In framing its recommendations
that cover matters affected by the
Autodesk case
decision, the Committee has kept in view its mandate to
recommend what the law should be.
The meaning of “adaptation”
5.26 The issue of adaptation was not considered by the High Court. However,
the full Federal Court, in determining whether the Autokey
lock was an
adaptation of the AutoCAD lock, considered the definition of
“adaptation” in s.10(1). It concluded that an
adaptation was a
version of the work which embodies or preserves the original qualities of the
to the word “version” used in
the definition was its ordinary meaning, ie, “a special form or variant of
something”.
In this regard Lockhart J commented that there were indicia in
the definition of adaptation which demonstrated that a work may be
an adaptation
of another work notwithstanding considerable differences between them. However,
the Court’s conclusion was that,
as the only element that the Widget
C–AutoCAD lock program had in common with the Autokey lock was their
function, the Court
was precluded from finding that the Autokey lock was an
adaptation by reason of being a version of the AutoCAD lock within the
of adaptation.
The 1984 Amendments
6.01 The amendments made to the
(the Act) in 1984
to afford protection to computer programs were clearly skilfully conceived and
drafted and appear to have served
adequately the interests of the computer
industry for the past ten years. Since their introduction in 1984, the
amendments have given
rise to only two significant cases:
[1992] HCA 2
(1992) 173 CLR 330
Autodesk case)
Star Micronics Pty Ltd
Five Star Computers Pty Ltd
This fact in itself suggests that the amendments are working with a
good degree of success. In essence, the Committee acknowledges
that the 1984
amendments provide a fundamentally sound framework for the protection of
computer programs. Moreover, the type and
extent of protection for computer
programs adopted in Australia in 1984 have now been given international
endorsement by the TRIPS
agreement which states in article 10(1) that computer
programs are to be protected by copyright as literary works under the Berne
Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Berne
Convention). Viewed from this perspective, Australia stands
out as a leading
country in the protection of computer programs and has certainly not lagged
behind other countries in protecting
computer programs.
6.02 Nonetheless, the Committee notes that the Act has not been without its
critics, even though most of those critics have come from
within the legal
community and not those most affected by the operation of the
provisions—the computer industry. Additionally,
mostly as a result of this
reference, a number of suggestions have been made, both directly to the
Committee and more generally in
the community, to improve the 1984 amendments.
The Committee has formulated its recommendations taking account of both these
recommendations
and its terms of reference which required it to address the
issue of whether there was adequate protection of computer programs,
stored in computer memory and works created by or with the assistance of
computer programs. The short answer to the terms of
reference in relation to
computer programs is that “yes” the Act as drafted does adequately
protect computer programs.
However, the Committee adds this qualification to its
short answer—the Act should be amended to clarify some remaining
uncertainties
and to ensure more comprehensive protection for computer programs.
This is the underlying reason for, and the essence of, the Committee’s
recommendations.
SUMMARY OF RESPONSES TO THE DRAFT REPORT AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
6.03 The Committee received a number of submissions following the release of
its Draft Report which commented on aspects of this chapter
in that Draft. The
strongest criticisms made in relation to the Committee’s recommendations
in its Draft Report concerned the
definition of “computer program”
suggested by the Committee and the failure of the Committee to recommend the
of a definition of “computer”. The Committee’s
response to these submissions and an outline of the criticisms made
included at paragraph 6.18 and following. Other relevant comments have been
noted and discussed elsewhere in the chapter.
6.04 Some submitters also chose to express, once again, their opposition to
the protection of computer programs as “literary
works” and the
Committee’s recommendation that they be protected as such under the Act.
The Committee’s main discussion
of this issue is contained in Chapter 4.
It is sufficient to recall here that with the conclusion of the TRIPS agreement,
Draft Report was released, Australia is now bound to protect computer
programs as literary works under the Berne Convention.
6.05 In summary, the Committee’s recommendations have remained the same
since the Draft Report, except in relation to the definition
of reproduction.
Accordingly, the Committee’s recommendations are as follows:
(a) The words “whether or not in a visible form” be deleted from
the definition of “literary work” in s.10(1)
of the Act (paragraph
(b) A definition of “computer program” be retained in the Act
(paragraph 6.25).
(c) The current definition of “computer program” in s.10(1) of
the Act be deleted and the following definition substituted
“computer program” means a set of statements or instructions to
be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order
to bring about a certain
(d) No change be made to the Act to expressly provide that algorithms are not
protected by the Act (paragraph 6.36).
(e) A clarifying definition of “reproduction” with respect to
works stored electronically and in relation to computer
programs in source code
and object code be added to the Act. (paragraphs 6.55 and 6.76).
(f) The definition of “adaptation” in s.10(1) of the Act remain
unchanged (paragraph 6.77).
(g) No change be made to the definition of “material form” in
s.10(1) of the Act (paragraph 6.87).
DEFINITION OF “LITERARY WORK”
6.06 In 1984, s.10(1) of the Act was amended to provide that:
“literary work” includes:
(a) a table, or compilation, expressed in words, figures or symbols (whether
or not in a visible form); and
(b) a computer program or compilation of computer programs.
One of the features of this definition is that the words in brackets
“whether or not in a visible form” occurring in paragraph
relation to tables and compilations are not included in paragraph (b) which
deals with computer programs and compilations
of computer programs. It is in
relation to this aspect of the definition of computer program that the Committee
received comment
on the Draft Report from a number of submitters.
6.07 Prior to the Draft Report, the Committee received submissions from Apple
Computer Australia Pty Limited (Apple) and IBM Australia
Limited (IBM) that the
definition of “literary work” in s.10(1) of the
Act should be
amended. In its submission IBM suggested that the words in brackets were
superfluous. IBM was of the view that the definition
may be open to a
construction that a computer program must be in a visible form if it is to be
regarded as a literary work. Accordingly,
IBM recommended to the Committee that
the words in brackets in paragraph (a) of the definition should be added to
paragraph (b) of
the definition. The submission from Apple similarly queried the
effect of the words in brackets, but contrary to IBM, Apple suggested
words in brackets be removed from the definition altogether.
6.08 In response to these suggestions the Committee recommended that the
definition of “literary work” be amended and
the words in brackets
in paragraph (a) “whether or not in a visible form” be deleted
(Draft Report paragraph 6.04). The
Committee reached this view after considering
the submissions made by IBM and Apple and the other provisions of the Act which
with the subsistence of copyright in “works”, including
literary works.
6.09 Section 32(1) provides that copyright subsists in an original
unpublished work of which the author was a qualified person “at
when the work was made”. Section 22 provides that a reference to when a
work was “made” is to be read
as a reference to when the work
“was first reduced to writing or to some other material form”. Under
s.10(1) “material
form” is defined as including:
any form (whether visible or not) of storage from which the work
. . . can be reproduced.
Section 32(2) provides for the continuation of subsistence of copyright in
unpublished works after their publication, if criteria
concerning place of
publication and qualification of the author at the time of publication are
6.10 Having regard to s.22 of the Act and the definition of “material
form” the Committee was of the view that, since
the Act already provides
that copyright will subsist in works stored invisibly, there seemed no need for
the words in brackets in
paragraph (a) of the definition of “literary
work”. For this reason the Committee recommended that the words
or not in a visible form” in brackets in paragraph (a) of
the definition of “literary work” should be deleted.
6.11 The Committee received some comment from the Australian Copyright
Council (ACC) with respect to this recommendation. In its submission
stated that it was not certain whether it was necessary to remove the words from
the definition of “literary work”
as recommended by the Committee.
The Committee takes the ACC’s comments to mean, in effect, that the words
“whether or
not in a visible form” are not words of limitation, and
that it is possible that the current definition extends to literary
listed in the definition in (a)) or computer programs in a non-visible form.
Although the Committee has noted the ACC’s
comment, it is the
Committee’s view that given that both the ACC and IBM appear to be in
agreement that the additional words
“whether or not in a visible
form” do not really add anything to the definition of literary work, the
best course is
to remove them. Therefore the Committee abides by its previous
recommendation. (Recommendation 2.04(a)).
6.12 A related proposal was put forward by Mr. M Paterson of
Picton–Warlow & Co Solicitors who submitted that the definition
“work” should be amended so as to include the visible and the
invisible. Mr Paterson made this suggestion, in the
belief that it would
overcome any lingering doubts, as a result of the decision of Gibbs CJ and Deane
Computer Edge
Apple Computer
[1986] HCA 19
(1986) 161 CLR 171
), that works stored in a non-visible form are not
6.13 The Committee has considered this proposition, but notes as did Mr
Paterson that the decision of Pincus J of the Federal Court
Corporation
Lorenzo and Sons Pty Ltd
[1991] FCA 617
(1991) 22 IPR 245
), that a manual, a type of literary work, embodied in a computer disk
was a “work” eliminates some of this doubt. The
Committee also notes
that if the reasoning of the High Court in relation to computer programs in
Autodesk Inc
[1992] HCA 2
(1992) 173 CLR 330
Autodesk case
) was applied in relation to other types of
“works”, then all works would qualify for protection regardless of
of storage.
Protection of object code
6.14 In its submission Microsoft Pty Limited (Microsoft) suggested that a
provision should be inserted which deems a computer program
in object code to be
a literary work. The Committee notes that a majority of the High Court in the
were of the view that, prior to the 1984 amendments, copyright
protection as a literary work extended only to computer programs written
source code. In the
Autodesk case
the High Court was not asked to
consider whether a computer program in either source code or object code was a
literary work. However,
Mason CJ, Brennan and Deane JJ considered the effect of
the 1984 amendments on the definition of “computer program”.
Honours noted that to give the amendments a narrow, literal construction would
partly frustrate the obvious legislative intent
to confer real protection on
computer programs. In interpreting the definition of “computer
program”, their Honours said
that the definition should be understood as
conferring protection in a way that is adapted to copyright and found that it
to both visible and non-sensate (ie, invisible) forms of computer
programs. The storage of computer programs expressed in either
object or source
code in an electronic form will necessarily mean they are stored in a
non-sensate form. Accordingly, the Committee
takes their Honours to be
concluding that the definition applies to computer programs in both source or
object code, whether stored
electronically or not.
6.15 In the Draft Report, by way of preliminary discussion, the Committee
stated its understanding of the general classification of
computer programs
(paragraphs 6.06–6.09). This discussion now appears in Appendix N.
However, in the course of that discussion
the Committee did reach a number of
conclusions, set out below, which it confirms.
6.16 In relation to operating systems programs and applications programs the
Committee was of the view that as the distinctions between
them were no longer
clear cut, they should both be protected by copyright and in the same way.
6.17 The Committee also recommended that any definition of “computer
program” should clearly and unambiguously apply to
programs expressed in
source code, programs expressed in object code (compiled from source code) and
to microcode. The Committee
notes that this recommendation has received support
from those members of the Law Council of Australia (LCA) who agree that computer
programs should be protected by copyright as literary works (see further
discussion of this point at paragraph 6.19 and 6.21).
DEFINITION OF “COMPUTER
6.18 Following the 1984 amendments, “computer program” is defined
in the Act in s.10(1). The Act states that:
“computer program” means an expression, in any language, code or
notation, of a set of instructions (whether with or without
related information)
intended, either directly or after either or both of the following:
(a) conversion to another language, code or notation;
(b) reproduction in a different material form,
to cause a device having digital information processing capabilities to
perform a particular function.
The recent judicial interpretation of this definition is referred to in
paragraphs 5.16–5.17.
Comments received on the current definition in the
Protection of object code
6.19 The Committee received submissions from the Australian
Vice-Chancellors’ Committee (AVCC), Lotus Development Pty Ltd (Lotus),
Microsoft and the LCA which suggested that the current definition of
“computer program” does not clarify whether copyright
subsists in
computer programs written in object code. The Committee notes that these
concerns are wholly or partly based on the reasoning
of the High Court in the
(see paragraph 5.05). Having regard to the High Court’s
reasoning, Lotus and Microsoft submitted that the words in the definition,
“in any language, code or notation”, did not cover a sequence of
electrical impulses and could only be read as applying
to human readable source
code programs. Lotus suggested that the words in brackets in the definition
should be amended to read:
(whether with or without related information, whether visible or not and
whether in human or machine readable form).
In the Draft Report the Committee noted that the inclusion of the words
“in any language, code or notation” in the definition
“computer program” was intended to make it clear that copyright
protection extends to computer programs written (expressed)
in source or object
code (Copyright Amendment Bill 1984: Explanatory Memorandum, p.6). Having regard
to this and the High Court’s
decision in the
Autodesk case
paragraph 5.14 ), the Committee is of the view that it is now clear that
programs in object code fall within the definition
of “computer
program” and accordingly makes no recommendation in relation to this
Protection of programs written in declarative
6.20 The Draft Report also referred to other concerns raised by the AVCC
regarding the definition. The AVCC submitted that the words
instructions” may not apply to declarative programming languages, that is,
so-called fourth-generation languages,
which consist of a series of declarative
statements rather than instructions. The Committee recognises there is an
argument that
a strict interpretation of the definition might exclude programs
written in “non-procedural” languages. While the Committee
agree that such a restrictive interpretation would necessarily be adopted by the
courts, it does accept this as a reason
to consider changing the definition of
“computer program” in the Act.
6.21 The AVCC submission also suggested that the current definition may
exclude programs which are executed by interpretation as well
as those intended
to run on non-digital machines. In respect of the first point the Committee
notes that because a program written
in a high-level language cannot be executed
directly on a computer, two alternative techniques, namely compilation and
interpretation,
are used to execute a program written in a high level language,
(see Appendix N paragraph N.05 ). When a program is executed by interpretation
it is, in effect, treated as data by the interpreter program, which performs in
accordance with the instructions specified by the
program being interpreted. In
the Committee’s view, the way in which a program is executed (either by
compilation or interpretation)
is not relevant to the issue of determining
whether the set of instructions is a computer program. Accordingly, it does not
that programs executed by interpretation do not come within the definition
of “computer program” in the Act. The Committee
also considers that
the definition of “computer program” should, and does, cover
programs written in microcode, ie, microprograms
Use of the word “digital”
6.22 The final issue raised regarding the definition of “computer
program” concerns the word “digital”. In
its Issues Paper, the
Committee asked whether the reference to digital should remain in the definition
of computer program as it
precludes programs written for non-digital (analogue)
computers from coming within the definition. The observation by the AVCC that
the current definition may exclude programs written in code to run on
non-digital computers is the only substantial comment the Committee
received on
this issue. The Committee is uncertain as to the practical significance that
such an interpretation may have. However,
the Committee believes that the
definition of a computer program should have as broad an application as
possible. Accordingly, it
recommended in the Draft Report that the reference to
digital should be removed from the definition (Draft recommendation 2.03(3)).
This recommendation was supported in submissions from the CSIRO Institute of
Information Science and Engineering, Oracle Systems
(Australia) Pty Limited
(Oracle) and the LCA.
International approaches to defining
“computer program”
6.23 The Committee notes that, internationally, different approaches have
been adopted on the question whether to define the expression
program” or not. The approach taken by the European Union, including the
United Kingdom, is different from
that adopted by the United States and Japan.
Directive on the Legal Protection of Computer Programs
art.1(1) (Appendix G) (EC Directive on Computer Programs) the European Union has
not defined “computer program” but
expressly states that computer
programs are to be protected as “literary works”. The benefits of
this approach are that
any legislation implementing this Directive will be
sufficiently flexible to accommodate new developments in technology,
particularly
in this rapidly changing field, and many of the pitfalls of
interpretation, including some of the problems outlined above, are avoided.
6.24 The approach adopted in the United States and Japan has been, like that
in Australia, to define “computer program.”
Section 101 of the US
(US Act) defines a “computer program”
. . . a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly
in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.
The Japanese
(Law No. 48) provides in art.2(1)(x
) that “program” means:
an expression of combined instructions given to a computer so as to make it
function and obtain a certain result.
The principal benefit of defining “computer program” is that it
as the technology
and concepts involved in computer programs become increasingly familiar, the
need for such definitions decreases.
6.25 The Committee acknowledges that the approach of the European Union,
including the United Kingdom (
s.3(1)(b)) is attractive in that it allows for greater flexibility. However, the
Committee is of the view that to remove the definition
of “computer
program” from the Act may create uncertainty. The Committee therefore
recommends that a definition of “computer
program” be retained in
the Act (Recommendation 2.04(b)).
6.26 In the Draft Report the Committee recommended that the US definition of
“computer program” be substituted for the
definition—this recommendation attracted most comment from submitters. The
LCA did not support the adoption of the
definition, but did not elaborate on its
reasons for this view. The Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA)
the recommendation of the Committee. So did Dr Christie (Senior
Lecturer in Law, University of Melbourne) in a paper presented at
jointly organised by the Centre for International Research on Communication and
Information Technologies (CIRCIT) and the
University of Melbourne Law School in
September 1993, subject to his view that the approach adopted by the European
Union is preferable.
The ACC suggested that the effect of the adoption of the US
definition may be that American case law may become more relevant in
In a similar vein Mr Muratore (Partner, Freehill, Hollingdale and Page
Solicitors) expressed the cautionary view that
Australia should not borrow too
heavily from American precedents. It would be a matter for courts to determine
what weight will be
given American authorities. It is not to be assumed that
they will necessarily be given preemptive weight just because the Australian
definition of computer program is the same as the US definition. There are many
provisions in the Act governing the protection of
literary works that are not
the same as corresponding provisions in the US law. The American authorities
will be relevant for courts
to consider, as they are now. It does not follow
that they will be decisive of the outcome of any given case.
6.27 Messrs Houghton and Reid–Smith of CIRCIT submitted that the
reference to “a set of statements or instructions”
in the proposed
definition did not offer any certainty in determining the bounds of a relevant
computer program. The consequence
that they envisaged was that it would be
difficult, if not impossible, to determine if there had been a substantial
reproduction
of a computer program if there was no way of knowing how many
instructions or statements make up a set and especially if there were
criteria for establishing the “in-the-set” to the
“out-of-the-set” boundaries. Their submission suggests
a resolution
of this problem by focusing on the function of a particular statement or
instruction. In their view the appropriate
test would be whether a statement or
instruction “contributes to, and is an elemental part of the process of
performing a specific
function” in which case it would be part of the
“in-the-set” statements.
6.28 In the Committee’s view this “test” does not
necessarily need to form part of the definition of “computer
program” in the Act, especially as it relates to the issue of reproduction
more than to the issue of what is being protected.
It is a test that the courts
could apply when dealing with cases of alleged reproduction and which in any
event they must already
apply in determining the subject matter in question.
There are two other reasons for leaving to the courts the determination of what
is and what is not part of a computer program. The definition of “literary
work” gives no guidance such as is proposed
on what forms part of or does
not form part of works other than computer programs. This could be an issue in
relation to, eg, unpublished
notes for a draft of a novel. Second, that
definition refers to “a computer program or compilation of computer
acknowledging, so it seems, that what is under consideration
may constitute a single program or two or more programs. The facts of
Autodesk case
illustrate that possibility.
6.29 The Supporters of Interoperable Systems in Australia (SISA) submitted
that in addition to recommending the adoption of the definition
of computer
program in s.101 of the US Act the Committee should also recommend the adoption
of a form of exclusion such as occurs
in s.102(b) of the US Act. SISA’s
view was that this should be done in order to set more precise boundaries on
what elements
of computer programs are protected. SISA indicated that this
approach has been adopted by Japan in its Copyright Act (art.10(3) and
Directive on Computer Programs (art.1(2)). Section 102(b) of the US Act
In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship
extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of
operation, concept,
principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described,
explained, illustrated, or embodied
in such work.
6.30 The question of whether algorithms are protected as a result of
in this chapter at
paragraph 6.33. The Committee is of the view that its conclusions in regard to
algorithms apply equally to the
other items listed in s.10(2)(b). As the
Committee notes, with respect to algorithms, the fundamental nature of copyright
it does not protect ideas as such. For this reason, the Committee is of
the opinion that there is no need for an explicit statement
to this effect to be
included the Act. In reaching this conclusion the Committee has also taken note
of the views of the Computer
and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association
(CBEMA) who agreed that principles of copyright should apply to determine
specific elements of a computer program are copyrightable and the strong
opposition of IBM to SISA’s submission.
6.31 One final concern with the US definition, raised by the ACC, was that it
may not extend to include a defective computer program
which failed to
“bring about a certain result”. The Committee notes that this
concern could be addressed by inserting
the words “that is intended”
in place of the words “in order” in the US definition. However, the
considers that this would also have the undesirable effect of
protecting fragments of computer programs. The Committee also notes
present many computer programs are written with “bugs” or errors and
need to be corrected in order to operate
correctly. Makers of computer programs
such as the major software houses employ teams of people for this purpose.
Programs are continually
modified and updated with errors being corrected as
they are discovered. The Committee believes that the circumstances of the
and supply of a defective program would lead a court to determine
that protection should not be withheld because the defect prevented
performing as intended. The Committee is not aware that the US definition has
been shown to be deficient in ensuring protection
for these programs. For these
reasons the Committee is of the view that the definition, adopted in the US
legislation, is both adequate
and appropriate to describe the subject matter for
protection.
Conclusion and recommendation
6.32 The Committee is of the view that any definition of “computer
program” should not be unduly restrictive of future
developments in
programming languages and should be clearly comprehensive in its coverage. The
Committee is mindful that the position
adopted in Australia in relation to the
extent of the protection afforded to computer programs should, as far as
possible, be consistent
with that adopted by our major trading partners. The
Committee believes that the US definition, by using the words “to be used
directly or indirectly in a computer”, covers programs written in source
code, object code and microcode. Accordingly, it disposes
of any uncertainty
whether protection is limited to when the program code is visible. Also, the
inclusion of the word “statements”
clearly extends the scope of the
definition to cover programs written in declarative programming languages. The
definition omits
any requirement that the computer be digital. Finally, while
the definition does not include a reference to “expression of”
preceding “a set of statements or instructions”, the Committee
believes that the requirement of originality for copyright
to subsist in a work
in s.32(1)of the Act, would result in the expression–idea dichotomy being
applied to computer programs
thus defined, as it is to any other work.
Furthermore, the Committee notes that the definitions of other items
constituting works,
eg, “drawing” which is a form of artistic work
and which includes “diagram, map, chart or plan” does not
“expression of”. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the
definition of “computer program”
in the Act be replaced by the
definition used in the US Act which provides in s.101 (Recommendation
A “computer program” is a set of statements or instructions to be
used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to
bring about a certain
Should algorithms be protected ?
6.33 In their supplementary submission to the Committee, Gilbert & Tobin
Solicitors raised concerns whether copyright protection
under the Act extends to
the algorithms employed in a program. The Committee has adopted the following
definition of an algorithm
for the purposes of this report (
Processing-Vocabulary, ISO Standards Handbook 10
, 1982, p.16):
An algorithm is a finite set of well defined rules for the solution of a
problem in a finite number of steps.
Gilbert & Tobin Solicitors argued that if protection is extended to
algorithms, then the line between protecting the expression
of an idea and the
idea itself becomes almost impossible to draw. The Committee acknowledges this
to be a real concern.
6.34 The Explanatory Memorandum to the
stated in relation to the definition of “computer program” that
(p.6, paragraph 16):
The phrase “expression . . . of a set of instructions” is
intended to make it clear that it is not an abstract idea, algorithm
mathematical principle which is protected but rather a particular expression of
that abstraction.
This is consistent with the position taken in the EC Directive
Preamble to the Directive, Appendix G), the Japanese Copyright Act and with
directives from the US Copyright Office which state
that copyright protection
does not extend to algorithms. (US Copyright Office Circular R61:
Protection for Computer Programs
—quoted in 30 October 1990 submission
from Gilbert and Tobin Solicitors, p.4, fn.13).

Autodesk case
, Dawson J, with whom the rest of the Court
agreed, reiterated and reaffirmed the fundamental nature of copyright
protection. His

As Lindley LJ said in

“Copyright does not extend to ideas, or schemes, or systems or methods; it
is confined to their expression; and if their
expression is not copied the
true that it is often
difficult to separate an idea from its expression but it
is nevertheless fundamental that copyright protection is given only to the
in which ideas are expressed, not to the ideas themselves.
6.36 Having regard to the statement contained in the Explanatory Memorandum
and the decision of the High Court in the
Autodesk case
, the Committee
does not recommend any amendment to the Act expressly stating that copyright
protection does not extend to algorithms
(Recommendation 2.04(d)). It should be
noted that in its submission to the Committee in response to the Draft Report,
the US Government
supported the decision of the Committee on this issue.
Interestingly, this submission did not refer to s.102(b) of the US Act.
DEFINITION OF “COMPUTER”
6.37 In response to the Draft Report, Dr Christie indicated his support for
the decision of the Committee to recommend that the US
definition of
“computer program” be adopted subject to one reservation—that
the word “computer” should
be defined in the Act as well. Messrs
Houghton and Reid–Smith raised a similar point, submitting that if the
Committee was
assuming that a “computer” was “a device having
information processing capabilities” (which forms part of
the current
definition of “computer program”) then this may include (p.4):
. . . class[es] of devices with information processing capabilities . . . far
larger than the class of devices we usually call computers”.
6.38 The Committee recognises that Dr Christie and Messrs Houghton and
Reid–Smith are raising an important issue and the Committee
has considered
their suggestions. However, the Committee does not propose to recommend that a
definition of “computer”
be included in the Act. The Committee is
conscious that in recommending the replacement of the existing definition of
program” with the US definition, it is effectively
recommending removing a definition of “computer”. It has made
recommendation recognising the need for a technology neutral definition which is
not tied to the concept of digital computers
unlike the existing definition of
computer program. However, the Committee is not aware of a satisfactory
“technology-neutral”
definition of “computer” and
therefore prefers to leave it to the courts to apply a normal understanding of
what constitutes
a “computer”, in cases as they come to be decided.
The Committee has chosen to recommend the retention of the definition
“computer program” for the reasons already discussed in this
chapter, in particular, to create a greater degree of
certainty over what is
being protected and in order to grant limited exceptions to the rights of
THE MEANING OF “REPRODUCTION IN A MATERIAL
Reproduction in relation to works in
6.39 One of the rights of the copyright owner of a work is the right to
“reproduce the work in a material form” (s.31(1)(a)(i)).
“Material form” is the subject of an inclusive definition inserted
in the Act by the 1984 amendments. Section 10(1) provides:
“material form”, in relation to a work or an adaptation of a
work, includes any form (whether visible or not) of storage
from which the work
or adaptation, or a substantial part of the work or adaptation, can be
reproduced.
As to the meaning of “reproduction”, it is not exhaustively
defined in the Act. Apart from s.21, which deems sound recordings
and films of
literary, dramatic and musical works to be reproductions of the works recorded
or filmed, it has been left to the courts
to ascertain what constitutes a
reproduction. Reproduction has been held by the courts to encompass more than
literal copying of
a work; there must be objective similarity between the
original work and the alleged copy and there must be a causal connection between
the two (ie, there must be some evidence of copying)
Francis Day and Hunter

Hill (Football) Ltd
[1964] 1 WLR 273.
The requirement for objective
similarity between a work and a copy, in order to establish reproduction, poses
some difficulties where
the works are stored electronically. This difficulty is
discussed below from paragraph 6.46
6.40 The Committee received comments on the meaning of reproduction in a
material form from Apple, IBM and the LCA. In their submissions,
Apple and the
LCA took the view that the definition of material form does not answer the
argument put by the High Court in the
that programs in object
code are not a “reproduction” of the source code but, rather, the
result of action taken in compliance
with directions in the source code. (Put
another way, the source code program is the recipe and the object code program
ROM is the “rabbit pie” made in accordance with the
recipe). The Committee acknowledges that the LCA has raised legitimate
in relation to the consequences of the High Court’s decision in the
. The Committee’s following recommendations are made
having regard to the High Court’s reasoning and the various submissions
just referred to. However, the Committee feels it should make it clear that it
does not consider the High Court’s analysis
of the relationship between
source code and object code to be correct. Object code is created by the
translation of source code into
a machine readable form and not as a result of
action taken in compliance with directions in the source code. The source code
instructions
are translated into lower level object code instructions. The LCA
also submitted that the definition did not overcome the High Court’s
finding in that case that for there to be a reproduction of source code it must
be in a human readable form.
6.41 Concerns by Apple and Microsoft about the possible effect of the High
Court’s decision in the
regarding the meaning of
“reproduction” led them to suggest that a number of clarifying
definitions be added to the Act.
Apple submitted that a definition of
reproduction should be added to s.10(1) as follows:
“Reproduction” means: a material object in which a work is fixed
by any means from which the work can be perceived, produced,
or otherwise
communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.
6.42 Microsoft also submitted that reproduction should be defined. It
suggested that reproduction should include:
The copying or duplication of a work howsoever recorded, stored, or embodied
and whether visible or invisible and whether in human
or machine readable
Microsoft further suggested the recording, storage or embodiment of a work
should be deemed to include any media from which the work
can be retrieved by
electronic or other means.
6.43 As a consequence of the definition of reproduction it proposed, Apple
suggested further amendments to s.21 and to s.22 (which
determines when a work
or other subject-matter is made). Apple suggested adding the following
sub-section to s.21:
(5) For the purposes of the Act, a literary work shall be deemed not to have
been reproduced where a copy of the whole or any part
thereof is made in the
course of use on a computer in accordance with conditions (if any) imposed by
the copyright owner. The conditions
of any licence or other document
accompanying the work at the time of its original acquisition or of which the
acquirer was aware
prior to such acquisition shall be deemed to be conditions
imposed by the copyright owner.
6.44 Apple also suggested that the term “copy” should be defined
to include:
The material object in which the work is first fixed and that
“reproduce” should mean:
The making of a reproduction including storage of the work in any medium by
electronic means, or producing the work from such medium
of storage and that
s.22(1) should provide:
until it is recorded, in writing or otherwise, including
storage of the work in
any medium by electronic means; and references in this Act to the time at which
such a work is made are to
the time at which it is so recorded.
6.45 In its Draft Report the Committee stated that it was not persuaded that
there was a need for a general definition of “reproduction”
Act. The Committee’s exact words were (paragraph 6.27):
The Committee has given careful consideration to these suggestions. It notes
that the proposed definitions of the term “reproduction”
would apply
to all works protected under the Act. It could be expected that if the absence
of a definition of “reproduction”
caused copyright owners
difficulties in enforcing their rights, representations would be made by the
various organisations representing
their interests to the Government seeking
statutory clarification of the meaning of the term. The Committee understands
has not been the case. Accordingly, the Committee is not persuaded
that there is a need for a general definition of “reproduction”
6.46 Since the Committee made its recommendation in the Draft Report it has
had further opportunity to consider whether there is a
need for a definition of
reproduction in relation to works, and in particular in relation to works stored
in computer memory after
their initial creation in some other format. The
Committee is concerned that at present the concept of reproduction may not
electronically stored or “digitised” works. To be more
precise, the Committee is uncertain whether once a work in a more
traditional
form of expression is stored electronically (usually in a digital format) it can
then be said to be “objectively
similar” to the original work. It
should be noted that the Committee’s following comments will apply in
relation to its
discussion of databases in Chapter 14. It should also be noted
that the Committee is here concerned with the question whether digital
of a work in a printed form is a reproduction of that work and not whether the
conversion of a computer program in source
code and in printed form to object
code in digital form is a reproduction of the source code. That last mentioned
issue will be addressed
later in this chapter (paragraph 6.58
following).
Objective similarity
6.47 As indicated above at paragraph 6.39 the requirement for objective
similarity is one of the factors in determining a “reproduction”
a work. If the digitisation of a work is not regarded as an act of reproduction,
then the rights of copyright owners are, in the
Committee’s view, clearly
deficient. The possibility of this deficiency has been noted and debated by
various commentators
and was addressed, although briefly, in a number of
submissions made to the Committee following the Draft Report. The following
represent the Committee’s attempt to summarise and present this
6.48 In 1990 Professor Ricketson said (
Essays on Computer Law
‘Copyright and Databases’, 1990, 91 at 98):
. . . the storage of a written literary work in machine-readable form will
not be a reproduction of that work as there will be no
objective resemblance
between them . . . A similar conclusion would also be likely where the work
which is stored is not embodied
in writing but exists in some other material
form, such as a sound recording or a cinematograph film.
Professor Ricketson was discussing the law as it stood after the
and prior to the High Court decision in the
Autodesk case.
6.49 More recently Ms Ann Monotti has argued that the
Autodesk case
can be interpreted to overcome this problem in relation to computer programs
and other types of works, such as electronic databases
(Ann Monotti,
‘Copyright Protection of Computerised Databases’, AIPJ, (1992) 3,
135). In Ms Monotti’s view the
judgement of Mason CJ, Brennan and Deane JJ
Autodesk case
suggests that it is permissible in determining
whether there is objective similarity, and hence a “reproduction”,
an intangible reproduction (such as a scanned work) to a written
expression in order to make a valid comparison. In a commentary
on this aspect
of the judgement, Ms Ann Monotti says (at 146):
. . . the comparison for the purposes of reproduction would be between the
alleged reproduction and some form of written expression
of the set of
instructions, rather than with the electrical impulses. In fact, this is the
comparison which was made.
She then quotes from the
Autodesk case
The 127-bit series embedded in the EPROM in the Auto Key lock constituted a
reproduction in a material form . . . of a substantial
part of any actual or
theoretical “expression” in binary “notation” of the
“set of instructions“
constituting Widget C.
Ms Monotti’s discussion continues, with reference to the passage just
quoted from the
Autodesk case
(at 146–147):
This is a comparison between electrical impulses and written binary notation.
As the requirement for objective similarity is not mentioned,
their approach [ie
the High Court’s] could either result in removal of the need for objective
similarity in works of this kind
or in the acceptance that objective similarity
between works may be analysed by comparing the electrical impulses in the EPROM
expressed in binary notation with the work expressed in that form . . . One
could therefore argue that reproduction is not limited
to duplication of a work
in the same material form . . . Technical means, . . . could be used to
establish that the invisible works
are objectively similar . . . Objective
similarity could also be determined after “reading out” the data in
a human readable
works which are expressed in different material
forms, one of which is not visible to the human eye, may also be considered to
objectively similar if that resemblance could be assessed by converting the
invisible work into the same material form
(emphasis added).
6.50 Mr David Lindsay has also recently commented on the meaning of
reproduction and suggested the addition of a deeming provision
to s.21 of the
Journal of Law and Information Science,
Vol 4(2), 1993, 287) (His
article is based on a paper presented to the CIRCIT–University of
Melbourne seminar referred to at
paragraph 6.25). Mr Lindsay says
I do not think that anyone could disagree with the fact that there remain
important uncertainties about the application of the current
exclusive rights to
works incorporated in a computer database. There is, at the outset, considerable
uncertainty over the application
of the reproduction right. On the one hand,
even given some of the comments in the Autodesk decision, the status of the
requirement
of “objective similarity” between a work and a copy,
before there can be infringement, remains unclear. At a very basic
therefore, it is unclear whether a work stored in electronic form can be a
reproduction of a work in a written form . . .
While there are obvious dangers
involved in attempting to clarify something as basic to copyright protection as
the reproduction
right, I feel that the addition of some new deeming provision
in Section 21 of the Act, which deals with reproduction in different
dimensions,
should be looked at again; at least as a means for clarifying the conditions
under which the electronic storage, or downloading,
will constitute a
reproduction.
6.51 The Committee is of the view that the reasoning of the Federal Court in
Roland case
, already referred to at paragraph 6.13, lends support to
the views of Ms Monotti that a comparison to determine objective similarity
transforming a work stored in a particular form of storage to another can be
justified in order to make a visual comparison. In
that case Pincus J held that
the copying of a print-out of the contents of a disk reproduced the contents of
the disk. In reaching
this decision Pincus J recognised that the words and
symbols in the print-out and as stored in the disk were dissimilar, but he said
Reading s 31(1)(a)(i) with the definition of “material form”, one
gets the result that copyright in the content of the
disk includes the right to
reproduce the content of the disk in any form of storage from which the work
reproduced . . . Even if one regards the expression “the
work” as to be identified with the particular embodiment of
it on the disk
— rather than the words or other symbols so embodied — no doubt one
can, by typing the verbal and symbolic
content back onto an appropriate word
processor, reproduce the contents of the disk. Further, I think that to read the
“form . . . of storage” as excluding ordinary language
would be too narrow. The intention of the definition appears to
be to focus
attention upon the content of that which is copyright, rather than the
particular form in which it is embodied. A mere
change in form (for example from
digital to alphabetic expression) without any change in content gives a
reproduction, not an original
6.52 Comparable comments have been made in the United Kingdom. In
Richardson Computers Ltd
Flanders and Anor
[1993] FSR 497
, Ferris J referred to the earlier case of
Thrustcode Ltd
W W Computing Ltd
[1983] FSR 502
(which concerned a motion to obain an
interlocutory injunction to restrain alleged infringement of copyright in a
computer program)
in which Sir Robert Megarry V-C said (at 505–506):
In the normal case in which an infringement of literary copyright is alleged,
it is possible to put side by side the written, typed
or printed words in which
the plaintiff claims copyright and the corresponding words which are said to
infringe that copyright. The
words can be seen and compared and discussed. . .
For computers [and for works stored in computer memory] . . . what must be
are the things said to have been copied and the thing said to be an
infringing copy. If these two things are invisible, then normally
they must be
reproduced in visible form, or in a form that is in some way perceptible, before
it can be determined whether one infringes
6.53 Nonetheless, submissions to the Committee following the Draft Report
have highlighted the difficulty with the notion of reproduction
application to works stored electronically. Oracle posed a series of questions
concerning the conversion of works from non-digital
storage to digital storage
and vice versa and sought appropriate amendments to the Act to recognise such
changes in form. Also submissions
from the CBEMA, De Data and the ACC urged the
Committee to reconsider its recommendation. Both the ACC and Oracle raised an
concerning the digitisation of a work and then its alteration. According
to their submissions, the altered work may bear little resemblance
original work and so it would be hard to establish that there had been a
reproduction at any point, either in scanning the
works to digital storage or in
any alteration of the stored work.
Proposed deeming of digitisation to be
reproduction
6.54 Having reconsidered this issue, the Committee accepts the reasoning of
Ms Monotti that the Act as it stands may in fact offer
protection to copyright
owners whose works are being reproduced in different material forms.
Nonetheless, the Committee acknowledges
that proving reproduction by relying on
the “Monotti interpretation” is likely to be a difficult
interpretational task
of uncertain outcome. The Committee has had regard to the
concerns of those making submissions to it that the present legal situation
uncertain and would benefit from clarification. In accordance with the
Committee‘s terms of reference the Committee has
considered whether the
Act adequately and appropriately protects works stored in computer memory, and
has now formed the view that
the Act does not necessarily achieve this with
clarity with respect to the reproduction right. The Committee notes that the
Convergence Group, which was required by its terms of reference to
consider the adequacy of current copyright protection for broadcasts
transmissions) and underlying materials used in those transmissions, in its
Highways to Change—Copyright in the New Communications
Environment
, indicated that concern had been expressed to it about the
definition of “copy” in relation to subject matter other than
and that this may need to be addressed at a future time (p.64, paragraph 7.6).
6.55 Therefore the Committee recommends that a clarifying definition of
reproduction with respect to works stored electronically should
be added to the
Act (Recommendation 2.04(e)(i)). It may be appropriate to add such a provision
to s.21 of the Act which deems certain
dealings with works to be reproductions.
Such an amendment should be drafted so as to deem the mere act of conversion of
an adaptation of a work from its hard copy human readable form to an
electronic form of storage, such as digital, which is machine
readable and
which, when printed out is unintelligible by reason of consisting of machine
readable symbols to be a reproduction of
the work or the adaptation. Such
definition, or more accurately, interpretive provision would be non-exhaustive,
like for example
the existing definition of “literary work” which
only defines a fraction of the full possible range of such works. Similarly
instance of converting a work or an adaptation from an electronic form to a hard
copy, such as making a print out of a work stored
electronically should, in the
Committee’s opinion, be encompassed in the deeming definition.
6.56 Any new deeming provision should not extend to cover instances where a
work is converted from one visible material form to another
or from one
non-visible material form to another. In these instances it is the
Committee’s understanding that the issue of
objective similarity will not
arise and, in any event, the Committee wishes to ensure that the ordinary tests
of reproduction are
still applied where works are reproduced in such a way that
a comparison is possible based on objective similarity. It is also the
Committee’s intention that its recommendation not apply to screen
displays, which the Committee has recommended should not
be regarded as
constituting a reproduction in a material form ( See recommendation 2.52).
As far as published edition copyright is concerned, the Committee
considers that the definition of reproduction proposed in relation
should not apply to published editions. As the Committee’s discussion in
Chapter 15 indicates, the extent of the reproduction
right in relation to
published editions is necessarily confined to facsimile reproduction and the
bare act of scanning onto a database
would not constitute such a reproduction
(see paragraphs 15.11 and 15.13). The exclusion of the proposed definition of
“reproduction”
would be accomplished simply by the limiting of the
published edition right to facsimile reproduction.
Reproduction in relation to computer
6.58 The Committee’s recommendation that a new deeming provision in
relation to the reproduction of works and adaptations by
the acts of electronic
storage and retrieval be adopted will only have a limited impact in relation to
computer programs. It will
ensure that source code that is first written and
then stored electronically or created electronically and subsequently printed
will be protected by copyright against such storage and printing out without
authority, as each version will be a reproduction of
the other. Similarly a
print-out of the object code will be a reproduction.
6.59 In the Draft Report the Committee examined the lingering concerns as a
result of the High Court’s conclusion that, under
the Act before the 1984
amendments, a program in object code would not be considered to be a
reproduction of the source code of that
program. The Committee’s
discussion was as follows:
6.29 In the
Autodesk case
, the High Court clearly indicated that the
protection afforded under the Act to computer programs extended beyond programs
in source code to those which existed in a non-sensate form such as
electrical impulses (ie, programs in object code). Because of
their importance
to this issue, the comments of Mason CJ, Brennan and Deane JJ that have already
been discussed at paragraph 5.13
are recalled:
It is arguable that the effect of the 1984 amendments is merely to recognise
or description of
the relevant “set of instructions” in some “language code or
notation”. That narrow literal
construction would, however, partly
frustrate the obvious legislative intent to confer real protection upon the
actual set of instructions
regardless of whether they be actually expressed in
written form ... or stored in a non-sensate form such as electrical impulses
a disk, ROM or EPROM....
[T]he stored set of instructions in a non-sensate form such as electrical
impulses is itself protected on the basis that copyright
actually subsists in
any expression or description of it which can theoretically be made in language,
code or notation. On that basis,
the test of originality is satisfied by the
originality of the set of instructions
and any unauthorised expression
of it in language, code or notation will infringe the copyright in the computer
(emphasis added)
6.30 The judgment quoted in the last paragraph does not discuss why an
unauthorised object code version of a program would infringe
source code version of the program (or vice versa). However, given the nature of
the protection afforded to computer
programs, namely copyright, the reason can
only be that an object code version of a program is either a reproduction or an
of the program in source code.
6.31 In the decision of the Full Federal court in the
Autodesk case
Lockhart J considered the meaning of reproduction. His Honour commented:
The element which was held in the
Apple Computer case
essential ingredient of the notion of reproduction is that there should be
“a sufficient degree of objective similarity
between the two works”
Francis Day & Hunter Ltd
) or to use the language of
Gibbs CJ: “The notion of reproduction still connotes a resemblance between
the work in which copyright
subsists and the work which is copied from it. The
material form to which the respective works are reduced need not be the same,
but if the forms are so dissimilar as to deny resemblance between the works, one
cannot be said to be a reproduction of the other”.
In the light of these comments, the Committee thinks that it must remain
doubtful whether a computer program in object code is a reproduction
of the same
program written in source code.
The Committee does not, however, believe
that this question is of great consequence, now that the High Court has affirmed
that protection
extends to programs in object code. It understands that in the
usual case of alleged infringement of a program, the program allegedly
will have existed in object code. However, there may be the occasional case of
alleged infringement of a source code, eg,
where the source code allegedly
developed to object code by the defendant was not so developed by the plaintiff.
The Committee concludes
that if an unauthorised object code version made of a
program in source code infringes copyright in the source code and yet is not
reproduction of the source code, the basis of infringement must necessarily be
that it is an adaptation of the source code (emphasis
added — Final
6.60 In paragraph 6.31 of the Draft Report the Committee summarised the issue
of concern—that it is not clear whether it is
a reproduction of a computer
program in source code to render that same program in object code (see sentence
with emphasis added).
The Committee examined the amendment to the adaptation
right that was introduced in 1984 and said:
6.32 The meaning of adaptation was considered by Sheppard J in the
Autodesk case
His Honour noted that the word “version” which
appears in the paragraphs (a), (b), (ba) and (c) of the definition of
is not defined in the Act. His Honour concluded that the word version should
bear its ordinary meaning as “a special
form or variant of
something”. Lockhart J noted that paragraph (c)(ii) of the definition of
“adaptation” deemed
it to include a version of a literary work in
which the story or action is conveyed solely or principally by means of
pictures. He
took this to illustrate the “wide connotation to be
attributed to the word “version”” in the definition.
to paragraph (ba), which defines adaptations of computer programs and which he
said was “designed to cover many possibilities”,
and added that:
A clear case is where an adaptation is made from one code to another; for
example, from source code to object code.
6.33 On the basis of the High Court’s interpretation of copyright
protection for computer programs against unauthorised copying
augmentation of that protection that appears available via the adaptation right,
the Committee is of the view that a definition
of reproduction in respect of
computer programs is not required. Accordingly, it recommends that no change be
made to the Act in
this regard.
6.61 Having regard to the preceding discussion, the High Court’s
comments in the
Autodesk case
Committee’s discussion in Appendix N (concerning the relationship between
programs in source code and object code)
the Committee is of the view that a
computer program in object code is properly characterised as an adaptation of
the source code
program. For this reason, the need for a definition of
reproduction is considered together with the Committee’s discussion
scope of the adaptation right in paragraphs 6.63 and following.
6.62 It remains to be noted that the issue of reproduction also raises the
question whether a program that replicates the “look
and feel” of
another program, even though it may not be a reproduction of the code of that
other program, nevertheless infringes
that program. The protection of the
“look and feel” of computer programs which was adverted to in
paragraph 4.16, is
considered in detail in chapter 9, from paragraph 9.23
DEFINITION OF “ADAPTATION” AND
“REPRODUCTION”
6.63 The Committee received submissions from the AVCC, Apple, IBM, the LCA,
Lotus and Microsoft concerning the definition of “adaptation”
amended in 1984. IBM submitted that traditionally an “adaptation”
was regarded as a reproduction of the original work.
However, IBM noted that the
1984 amendments provided that, in relation to computer programs, an
“adaptation” is a version
“not being a reproduction of the
work” (emphasis added). IBM queried the need for this distinction in the
definition,
as in its view an “adaptation” of a computer program was
something “not altogether different from a reproduction”.
6.64 The Committee notes that, prior to the 1984 amendments, the adaptation
right in respect of literary works included the right
“dramatisations, novelisations, translations and picturisations” of
such works; these provisions were not altered
by those amendments, which added
paragraph (ba) defining “adaptation” in relation to computer
programs. Each of these
treatments of such works can be regarded as a type of
reproduction in a material form (Ricketson,
The Law of Intellectual
, 1984, paragraph 9.39). This accords with IBM’s contention
that traditionally an adaptation was regarded as a reproduction
of the original
6.65 Apple in its submission also regarded the words “not being a
reproduction of the work” as adding an unnecessary complication
definition. In Apple’s view, the words preclude the possibility (19 May
1989, p.16, paragraph 1.2.4.9):
. . . that object code is an adaptation of the source code, since it can also
be a reproduction of the source code.
Apple agreed with IBM’s submission to the extent that there is no
reason why an adaptation should not be a reproduction of the
original work
translated. By excluding reproductions from the definition Apple took the view
that only “look and feel”
versions of programs fell within the
definition. Accordingly, Apple suggested that the definition of
“adaptation” should
be worded as follows (19 May 1989, p.55,
paragraph 3.12.1.1):
(ba) in relation to a literary work being a computer program – a
version of the work in which it is converted into or out of
a computer language
or code into a different computer language or code, or any other form in which
the work may be recast, transferred
or adapted, otherwise than incidentally in
the course of running the program.
6.66 Submissions from the AVCC, the LCA and Lotus all queried the effect of
the definition in light of the High Court’s decision
. In its submission the AVCC noted that the majority of the High Court
held there was no relationship between source code and object
code. As mentioned
in paragraph 5.05, the High Court found that object code is the result of
following instructions inherent in the
source code and in no way expresses or
renders the object code an adaptation or reproduction. As already indicated in
paragraph 6.40
the Committee does not agree with the High Court’s analysis
of the relationship between source code and object code. The LCA
also expressed
doubt that object code is an adaptation of source code because the High Court
did not regard a program in object code
as being a literary work. Lotus
suggested that object code embodied in ROM may not be a version of the source
code because Deane
J took the view that object code in ROM is not a version but
a functional article made according to a description or specification.
6.67 The submissions from Lotus and Microsoft also argued that object code
should be protected whether or not it is capable of being
regarded as a work in
its own right. Accordingly, Lotus suggested that s.31(1)(a)(vii) which deals
with the rights subsisting in
an adaptation should be amended to read as
(vii) to do, in relation to an adaptation of the work any of the acts
specified in relation to the work in subparagraphs (i) to (v),
Microsoft submitted that, consistent with its view, the definition of
adaptation should be amended by adding the words:
and whether or not the version, translation, arrangement or transcription as
the case may be is itself a work.
Microsoft also suggested that the definition of an adaptation should be
expanded to include derivative works by adding the words “a
program which is a derivative of the first mentioned computer program”. In
its first submission in response to the
Draft Report Oracle supported
Microsoft’s view that adaptation should be defined to include derivative
6.68 The Committee understands that the concern of computer program
manufacturers is that the unauthorised rendering of a program
in another code,
and in particular the rendering of a source code in object code, may not be
indisputably subject to the control
of the program copyright owner. This concern
is prompted by lingering concerns that object code may not be a reproduction of
source code (see paragraph 6.60), and doubts that a program in object code
is a work and, as such, able to be regarded as an adaptation
of the source code.
As to the eligibility of a program in object code for protection, the joint
judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan and
Deane JJ in the
Autodesk case
to the Committee to have removed those doubts, as noted in paragraph 6.29 of the
Draft Report (see paragraph 6.59).
6.69 In its consideration of the definition of “adaptation” the
Committee has also had regard to the reasons for granting
the owners of
regards it as essential that the copyright
owner should have the exclusive right
to make versions of his or her programs which embody or preserve the original
qualities of
the program. Of course, the scope of this right should not extend
to the protection of underlying ideas. The types of acts recognised
Committee as coming within the term “adaptation” include any form of
translation or compilation of a computer
program, including the conversion or
translation of a program in source code from one language to another language
and compilation
of a program in source code into object code. The definition of
“adaptation” contemplates such conversions by the inclusion
words “whether or not in the language, code or notation in which the work
was originally expressed”.
6.70 In his second reading speech on the
the then Attorney-General (Senator Gareth Evans) said:
One of the important rights in literary works is the right of adaptation,
which includes translation. Although computer scientists
speak of translation of
a program from one computer language to another, this may not presently be taken
by the courts to be translation
in the sense in which it appears in the present
definition of adaptation in relation to a computer program is intended to
make clear that it covers translation between computer
languages of different
levels such as happens when a program is being compiled or assembled.
The Explanatory Memorandum to the Act included the following comment on the
amendment to the definition of “adaptation”
(paragraph 14):
It is also possible for a program to be converted from object code into
source code, or between different languages of similar level.
circumstances this process will result largely in substantial reproduction of
the original program. In other cases, however,
such as compilation followed by
decompilation, the differences may be so substantial that one cannot speak of a
reproduction although
the final product is clearly derived from the original.
The new definition of adaptation is intended to cover such situations.
6.71 These quotations make it clear that the amendment was intended to cover
the case where rendering a program in source code in
object code or vice versa
would not normally be considered a reproduction. Accordingly, it appears to the
Committee that the intended
scope of paragraph (ba) of the definition of
“adaptation” as conveyed by the extrinsic materials quoted in
6.70, is based on the understanding by the draftsman that a computer
program in object code (created by the compilation of a source
code program) is
not a reproduction of the source code but an adaptation. This accords with the
Committee’s view expressed
in paragraph 6.61.
6.72 A result of an object code version of a program being characterised as
an “adaptation”, of the source code instead
“reproduction” of the source code program would be that the owner of
lose control over adaptations made
from the adaptation (object code program). This is because under s.31(1)(a)(vii)
the rights of
the owner of copyright in a work in relation to adaptations of the
work do not include the right to control adaptations
adaptations—
that is, where that owner is not also the owner of
limitations
of the adaptation right is contained in Chapter 9 from paragraph
9.51 onwards.
6.73 The Committee believes that it is particularly important that the right
of owners of copyright in computer programs to control
whatever may properly be
regarded as reproduction should not be curtailed by the intrusion of the
adaptation right with its limitation
just referred to. The Committee also
understands that in most cases object code programs will be derived from source
code by compilation
and that for practical purposes the industry regards the
object code version of a program as a mechanical derivative of the source
version, in other words as effectively a reproduction of the source code.
6.74 Despite this understanding in the computer industry, it is evident from
the preceding discussion that the law does not presently
interpret the
relationship between the two forms of code in this way. Because of the
requirement for objective similarity between
original works and reproductions,
the law views the relationship between source code and object code as analogous
to that of a musical
work and a sound recording, a book and a film based on it
or a plan and a building constructed from it. In all of these instances,
physical form of the sound recording, the film and the building could not be
viewed as being objectively similar to the originating
works, even though by
playing the sound recording or viewing the film or examining the building the
derivation from the original
work may be ascertainable. For this reason the Act
deems these representations of the works and other subject matter to be
reproductions.
6.75 Section 21(1) of the Act, which gives effect to articles 9(3) and 14(1)
of the Berne Convention, provides that a sound recording
or a cinematograph film
of a literary, dramatic or musical work is deemed to be a reproduction. Artistic
works are dealt with in
s.21(3). It provides that the conversion of an artistic
work from two-dimensional form to three-dimensional form and vice versa is
to be regarded as a reproduction. In the Committee’s view these provisions
serve the function of clarifying the scope
of the reproduction right where the
test of objective similarity cannot be easily satisfied.
6.76 For the same reason and given the close relationship between source code
and object code versions of a program the Act should
be amended by the addition
of a deeming provision which provides that, in relation to a computer program, a
reproduction includes
(but is not limited to) (Recommendation 2.04(e)(ii)):
(a) an object code version of the program that has been derived from the
program in source code by compilation; and
(b) a source code version of the program that has been derived from the
program in object code by decompilation.
Such an amendment will provide effective protection of copyright
owners’ property. The impact of this recommendation on the
scope of the
exclusive right of authors of computer programs to reproduce them is discussed
in Chapter 9, from paragraph 9.05 and
6.77 If this recommendation is adopted the Committee notes that there will be
no need to alter the wording of the definition of an
adaptation in s.10(1) and
accordingly recommends that no change be made to the definition of adaptation in
the Act (Recommendation
2.04(f)). A consequence of deeming both object compiled
from source code and source code decompiled from object code to be a
reproduction
would be that the scope of the definition of adaptation will in
effect be narrowed to cover only different source code versions of
written in source code, ie, translations other than compilations or
decompilations, eg new versions of a program obtained
after porting or error
correction. Chapter 9 discusses the scope of the adaptation right in the light
of this recommended change
in paragraph 9.51 and following.
6.78 The Chairman has misgivings about the recommendation in paragraph 6.76.
On balance, he would prefer that no definition of “reproduction”
recommended so that it will be for the courts to give the word content upon the
basis of the facts and circumstances of each particular
case and the
developments in technology current at the time of the particular decision. That
is the present position. It is to be
observed that there is no definition of
“reproduction” in any of the more recent legislation of the common
law countries.
6.79 The concern of those who recommend a definition appears to be based on
the fact that s.31 of the Act does not confer upon the
owner of copyright in
works the exclusive right to make an adaptation of an adaptation of a work.
Section 31(1)(a)(vii) provides
that copyright, in relation to a work, is the
exclusive right to do, in relation to a work that is an adaptation of another
any of the acts specified in relation to the first-mentioned work in
subsections (i) to (v) inclusive. Subsection (1)(a)(vi), which
confers the
exclusive right to make an adaptation of a work, is omitted from subsection
(vii). The reason for this would seem to
be that the making of an adaptation of
anything will usually involve both an element of copying and an element of
original work.
An adaptation may be distinguished from a reproduction which is
the literal copying of something and thus involves no original work
6.80 The present problem stems from the likelihood that all or part of the
source code of a program which is expressed in object code
or which is in
machine readable form may be retrieved without the authority of the copyright
owner. This may amount to an adaptation
of something which is itself already an
adaptation. That will not universally be the case, but it may be true in some
6.81 There is no problem about the unauthorised conversion of source code to
object code. That will either be a reproduction of the
source code or an
adaptation of it; see subsection (ba) of the definition of
“adaptation” in s.10(1) which is to be retained.
6.82 For present purposes the relevant part of the proposed definition of
“reproduction” in paragraph 6.76 is paragraph
(b). It provides that
a reproduction includes (but is not limited to) a source code version of the
program that has been derived
from the program in object code by decompilation.
It is the words “by decompilation” which concern the Chairman. This
is because, in his view, they are too restrictive. It is likely that, in the
future, even if not now, source code may be retrieved
from object code by a
means other than decompilation. The Chairman appreciates that the definition is
not exhaustive but his fear
is that there will be unauthorised retrievals of
source code from object code which will not be unlawful because the retrieval
not been achieved by decompilation. The fact that the definition is not
comprehensive may not overcome the problem. A court may well
say that the
legislature has expressly indicated its intention in relation to the
circumstances in which unauthorised retrieval from
object code will be
6.83 An earlier draft of paragraph (b) of the definition of
“reproduction” circulated to members of the Committee used
“by any means including decompilation”. The Chairman, despite his
preference for no definition at all, was
prepared to accept this because the
words covered the field. The reason for the change stems from a concern that the
retention of
the words “by any means” would produce an inconsistency
or unevenness between the recommendations in Chapter 10 concerning
exceptions to
exclusive rights and the definition of “reproduction” in this
chapter. Some of the recommendations in Chapter
10 recommend allowing
decompilation for certain specified purposes. In no case, however, is there to
be a general right of decompilation
nor is there to be a right to engage in
reverse engineering which extends beyond endeavouring to understand the way in
which a program
works and the underlying idea of it by operating the program,
studying its operation and studying any published literature about
Chairman fails to understand why these matters give rise to any problem
concerning the meaning of reproduction. In numerous
situations, the law, whether
statutory or judge-made, provides for a general rule and specified exceptions to
that rule. The situation
is common. The general rule will be stated widely; the
exception will be stated narrowly and precisely. Here the definition of
“reproduction”
needs to be expressed in wide terms; otherwise
activity which ought to be unlawful will not be caught. The exceptions provided
in Chapter 10 can be stated specifically and precisely. The terms in which
they are expressed will show quite plainly what is excepted.
All else will be
within the general rule and thus unlawful if unauthorised.
6.84 It follows that, in the Chairman’s opinion, if there is to be a
definition of “reproduction” it should contain
some such words as
“by any means” which were originally included. An alternative course
would be to amend s.10(1)(ba)
of the Act so as to apply it expressly to the case
of the retrieval of source codes from other forms of expression of computer
This has two advantages. It leaves the problem to be dealt with as one
concerning adaptation and not reproduction, something which
the industry, the
legal profession and the courts have been used to since the 1984 amendments.
Secondly, it avoids the danger that
defining “reproduction”, albeit
inclusively rather than exhaustively, will tend to restrict or limit the reach
of “adaptation”
in this area. Indeed, the insertion of the
definition of “reproduction” may turn an area which has been certain
which people are used to working into one that is quite unclear and
needs recharting. There is no reason for an excursion into unchartered
6.85 Finally, the problem raised by these various considerations should be
recognised for what it is. It is a drafting problem. The
Committee is not
attempting to draft legislation. Its task is to consider and make
recommendations about matters of substance. In
the Chairman’s opinion, the
legislation should ensure that computer programs in whatever form they are
expressed are safe from
piracy. At the same time certain specific situations in
which a person is allowed to reproduce or adapt a program without the consent
the owner of the copyright need to be provided for. Perhaps that is all that
needs to be said about this whole problem.
The definition of “material
6.86 In relation to the exclusive right to reproduce a literary work
(computer program) “in a material form” (s.31(1)(a)(i)),
submitted that the definition of “material form” in s.10(1) is
circular, because (1989, p.13):
. . . whether a particular form is a material form in the expanded sense is
determined by its having the quality that “the work”
can therefrom
be reproduced in a form of the same type [ie, any form from which a reproduction
can be made in a similar form to the
original work]. However, what type of form
that is, is not resolved.
The Committee considers that this analysis of the definition of
“material form”, which is set out in paragraph 5.01, pays
insufficient attention to the words “of storage” immediately
following “(whether visible or not)” in the
definition. It is
apparent from these words that the intention of the definition is to cover any
way now known or hereafter devised
for capturing a work so that it can be
reproduced. As noted earlier in the chapter, “reproduced” could
cover substantial
similarity as well as an identical copy.
6.87 The Committee also notes that the definition of material form is an
inclusive, not exhaustive, definition. The sense described
in an inclusive
definition serves to extend the normal meaning not to overtake it (cf
Local Board of Barton–Eccles
(1883) 8 App Cas
Lord Selborne LC at 801. This sense identifies a distinct test against which a
form can be measured and any further
resolution (suggested by IBM) would
sacrifice the generality to this test. Accordingly, in the Committee’s
view, “material
form” should be construed as meaning not only
something of corporeal form, composed of matter, but as including those forms
storage where a work or an adaptation of a work exists in a form that would not
normally be regarded as material, such as electronic
and magnetic forms of
storage, but which are amenable to reproduction. For this reason it does not
agree with IBM’s conclusion
that the definition is necessarily circular.
The Committee therefore recommends that no change be made to the definition of
form in s.10(1) of the Act (Recommendation 2.04(g)).
Ownership of Copyright in Computer Programs
Section 35(2)
(the Act) provides that,
subject to the section, the author of a literary work is the owner of any
Subject to what is later to be mentioned in
relation to employees and some other classes of persons, it follows that at the
time the owner of the copyright in a computer program is the author.
JOINT AUTHORS
7.02 Very often more than one author will be involved, with the consequence
that the provisions dealing with works of joint authorship
will apply. In this
respect s.78 of the Act provides that a reference in the Act to the author of a
work shall, unless otherwise
expressly provided by the Act, be read, in relation
to a work of joint authorship, as a reference to all the authors of the work.
Section 79 provides that references in s.32 (original works in which copyright
subsists) and in s.34(2) (ascertainment of authors
of anonymous and pseudonymous
works) to the author of a work shall, in relation to a work of joint authorship,
be read as references
to any one or more of the authors of the work.
7.03 On the basis that all computer programs in whatever form they are
expressed are required to be protected as literary works (see
Chapter 4), the
Committee is of the opinion that these general provisions should continue to
apply to computer programs. Many computer
programs will be written or compiled,
not by one person, but by many. This circumstance may not infrequently give rise
to difficulty
in ascertaining the persons, or the totality of the persons, who
are joint authors. The position is likely to be more difficult than
is in relation to conventional works because the authors of computer programs
are likely to be substantially more numerous
than is the case in respect of
other works.
7.04 A further problem may arise in relation to programs which are the
subject of the work of numerous authors but where the authors
are not joint
authors. Such a situation could occur where a program is the result of the
putting together of several separate and
distinct sections each written or
compiled separately from the others. In such cases the reality may be that there
are a number of
separate and distinct works which have been joined together to
constitute one program. The entire program may not be a work of joint
authorship. Each separate section will be itself a work in which copyright will
subsist and there may be a separate copyright in
the compilation of those
7.05 Despite these various problems, the Committee sees no alternative to
leaving the present provisions in place. If disputes occur,
courts may need to
determine complex questions of fact and law which may arise in a given case. But
it is not a matter which is appropriate
for legislation. It would be undesirable
and impractical to endeavour to provide comprehensively for the numerous
possibilities which
there might be as a consequence of these difficulties.
Individual treatment is necessary and this can only be afforded by the
determination
of disputes by courts (See Recommendation 2.05 at paragraph 7.09).
EMPLOYED OR COMMISSIONED AUTHORS
7.06 The present position is ameliorated to a degree by the provisions of
s.35(6) which provides that where a literary work, to which
neither of the last
two preceding subsections (subsections (4) and (5)) applies, is made by the
author in pursuance of the terms
of his employment by another person under a
contract of service or apprenticeship, that other person, ie, the employer, is
of any copyright subsisting in the work. Reference will be made to
s.35(4) and (5) a little later. The present position then is that
author of a program is an employee and it is made in pursuance of the terms of
his/her employment, it will be the employer
who is the owner of the copyright
and not the employee. The Committee is of the opinion that this provision should
be retained in
relation to computer programs.
7.07 In its Draft Report the Committee advanced the view that, so far as
computer programs were concerned, it would take the position
somewhat further.
It took the view that no distinction should be made between employees and
persons (not employees) who were retained,
for example as consultants or
independent contractors, to create a program. The Committee saw this as avoiding
unnecessary inquiries
into whether particular relationships were employment
relationships or contractual relationships of a different kind. More
importantly,
it seemed to the Committee to be more sensible and more equitable
to confer ownership on the person who had commissioned the writing
of a program
rather than upon those, whether employees or not, who were the authors of it. In
so saying, the Committee noted that
it would, of course, be possible for the
parties to any arrangement to reach an agreement providing expressly for the
ownership of
the copyright. It would be open to them to agree that,
notwithstanding the provisions of the legislation, the copyright was to be
by one or more specified persons, whether the authors, the commissioner or some
other person or persons or by persons falling
into all or some of these
categories. It seemed to the Committee that, if the present s.35(6), insofar as
it applies to computer
programs, were amended along the lines favoured, a great
many of the potential problems which may exist in relation to works of joint
authorship would tend to disappear. In the Committee’s view, there would
be more certainty and a fairer regime.
7.08 At least eight submissions commented on the view of the Committee, in
its Draft Report, that ownership of copyright in commissioned
computer programs
should reside with the commissioning party. All of the comments opposed that
view. However, reports of public discussion
include comments supporting the
Committee’s view, as did at least one journal article ([1994]
European Intellectual Property Review
Also, the Committee did not
attach a lot of weight to one of the criticisms of its view, namely, that
adoption of original copyright
ownership by commissioning parties would set us
apart from, and complicate cross-border transactions with parties in, other
Recommendation regarding all authors
7.09 The Committee has the impression that there is already a variety of
approaches around the world to ownership of copyright in
works by employed and
commissioned authors. Nevertheless, after reviewing the various comments on its
Draft Report, the Committee
accepted that the task of identifying the author(s)
of computer program was not so much more difficult—if indeed more
at all—than in the case of some other types of copyright works
as to justify a different allocation of copyright ownership
from that applying
to other works. Accordingly the Committee now recommends against any change to
the provisions of s.35(6) in its
application to computer programs
(Recommendation 2.05).
EMPLOYEES OF NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES AND SIMILAR
PERIODICALS
7.10 Reference needs now to be made to ss.35(4) and (5). Section 35(5) is of
no relevance to the present problem because it applies
to artistic works.
Section 35(4) has special application in relation to persons employed by the
proprietors of newspapers, magazines
or similar periodicals under contracts of
service or apprenticeship. If works are made by employees for the purpose of
publication
in newspapers, magazines or similar periodicals, the relevant
proprietor is the owner of any copyright subsisting in the work insofar
periodical, broadcasting the work, or reproduction
of the work for the purpose
of its being so published or broadcast, but not otherwise. This provision is
unlikely to be of any relevance
in relation to the making of computer programs.
They will not be published in newspapers, and journalists will be unlikely to
computer programs at least in the ordinary course of their employment as
journalists. Insofar as the section does have relevance
in relation to
subject of a separate reference to
the Committee, which presented its
conclusions and recommendations in its
Report on Journalists’
published in June 1994. For present purposes it is enough to say
that neither s.35(4) nor s.35(5) has relevance to the ownership
of computer
COMPUTER PROGRAMS PRODUCED IN EDUCATIONAL
INSTITUTIONS
7.11 It remains to say something of computer programs produced by students of
educational institutions. In submissions made to the
Committee by the Australian
Vice-Chancellors’ Committee and Australian Committee of Directors and
Principals Limited (AVCC–ACDP)
it is said that there is an issue as to who
should own computer programs produced by staff and/or students, particularly
are produced by the use of equipment and other resources provided by
the institution. Reference was made to s.35(6) of the Act and
acknowledged that, in relation to a staff member, ownership of copyright would
depend upon whether or not the work was created
in pursuance of the terms of
his/her employment. In the case of students it was acknowledged that ownership
resided with the student.
Paragraph 29 of the submission (July 1989) was as
Whilst the existing scheme may or may not be particularly clear or desirable,
it would seem that it may not be something that is best
dealt with in the
probably best left for agreement between
higher education institutions, and
staff and students by way of contractual provision in employment contracts and
institutional rules
and statutes.
In the light of that submission, the Committee does not recommend the making
of any special provision for the ownership of copyright
in computer programs
produced by either staff or students of educational institutions.
COMPUTER PROGRAMS PRODUCED BY OR FOR
GOVERNMENTS
7.12 In its very well considered and detailed comments on the Committee's
Draft Report, the Australian Copyright Council (ACC) invited
the Committee to
comment on the appropriateness of ss.176–178 in their application to
computer programs. Sections 176 and 178
vest in the Commonwealth or a State or
Territory the copyright in original works, sound recordings and films made by or
direction or control, where that would not result under other
provisions of the Act. Section 177 vests in the Commonwealth or a State
Territory the copyright in works first published in Australia under its
direction or control. The ACC expressed doubt about the
justification for the
provisions, which are based on provisions in the UK
that were not carried over into the
. The ACC questioned the justification for ss.176–178 particularly
in relation to material that it referred to as not "governmental"
by nature. The
ACC envisaged—but without providing recorded instances of—cases
where copyright would vest in a government
under those sections but would not do
so otherwise. In inviting the Committee to appraise the justification for these
sections, the
ACC noted that the Committee had made a recommendation for
amendment to s.183 which provides for a general licence to governments
the copyrights of others, subject to notifying such use and terms for the use
(Draft Report—paragraph 10.83, Final Report—paragraph
Recommendation 2.33).
7.13 As to the last mentioned comment by the ACC, the Committee addressed the
merits of s.183 in relation to government use of computer
programs because the
issue had been raised in submissions received prior to preparation of the
Committee's Draft Report. Also, it
was made aware of allegations of the
widespread unauthorised use by government agencies of computer programs.
However, while not
denying that there may be a good case for reviewing
ss.176–178, the Committee does not feel able to embark on that exercise
the context and circumstances of this reference. As already noted, the Committee
has not been provided with instances of the oppressive
consequences of
ss.176–178, although this is not to deny the possibility that instances
have occurred. If the Committee had
been persuaded that changes to the
provisions might be desirable, it would have preferred to give governments the
opportunity to
respond to such a conclusion, as it did in the case of s.183 by
including its recommendation in its Draft Report. The Committee understands
governments are substantial creators of computer programs, and would have a
clear interest in considering any suggested changes
to the provisions concerning
government ownership of copyright. For these reasons, the Committee concludes
that it should not make
any recommendation regarding ss.176–178, and
simply draws attention to the ACC’s concern for whatever further
consideration
the Government may care to give to it.
Duration of Protection of Computer Programs
8.01 The duration of protection of computer programs is a difficult area.
Article 7 of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic
Works (Berne Convention) provides that the period of protection for literary and
artistic works is the life
of the author and a further period of 50 years. That
provision is given effect to in Australia by
(the Act). Article 7(6) of the Berne Convention provides that member
countries may grant a longer term of protection. As noted in
Chapter 3, the
TRIPS Agreement adopted as part of Final Act of the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade negotiations concluded in
December 1993, ie, after release of
the Committee’s Draft Report, requires member countries to comply with
art.7 of the Berne
Convention, amongst others, and to protect computer programs
as literary works under the Berne Convention. Article 12 of TRIPS further
Whenever the term of protection of a work, other than a photographic work or
a work of applied art, is calculated on a basis other
than the life of a natural
person, such term shall be no less than 50 years from the end of the calendar
year of authorised publication,
or, failing such authorised publication within
50 years from the making of the work, 50 years from the end of the calendar year
COMMITTEE’S
VIEW IN DRAFT
Term of protection
8.02 In its Draft Report, the Committee expressed the view that, in relation
to computer programs, the period of life of the author
plus 50 years was not
only too long but also likely to be productive of substantial uncertainty and
difficulty. The Committee’s
view was that the desirable period of
protection should be no more than 50 years from the end of the year in which the
program was
made. Some members of the Committee considered that a period of 25
years would be sufficient. It would be a matter for the court
in each case to
determine the date or year of making. This was something which it was accustomed
to doing in relation to all types
of works, by reason of s.22 of the Act. That
section provides, inter alia, that a reference to the time when a work was made
be read as a reference to the time when the work was first reduced to
writing or some other material form. It will be recalled that
the definition of
“material form” was inserted in 1984. It includes any form (whether
visible or not) of storage from
which a work or adaptation can be produced.
Published and unpublished works
8.03 The Act presently draws a distinction between the rights conferred in
respect of an unpublished work and those conferred in respect
of a work that has
been published. In its Draft Report, the Committee also expressed the view that
no distinction should be drawn
in relation to the length of the period of
protection in respect of unpublished and published computer programs. Presently
of the Act provides that if, before the death of the author of a work,
the work was not published (or publicly performed, broadcast
or released on
record) copyright in the work continues to subsist until 50 years after the
expiration of the year in which the work
is first published, etc. If the work is
never published (or publicly performed, broadcast or released on record),
indefinitely. Many programs will be published in the sense
that they are sold or licensed on wholesale or retail markets, but many
not. However the Committee saw no reason to distinguish between the two. There
may be good reason for allowing copyright to
subsist in conventional literary
works for however long they remain unpublished, performed, etc; for example,
private letters not
intended for publication when written. However, all computer
programs have a utilitarian purpose and, whether published or not, will
limited useful life because of constant development of computer technology.
Accordingly, the Committee affirms its draft recommendation
that the existing
term of protection consisting of life of the author plus 50 years should apply
to all computer programs, whether
published or unpublished (Recommendation
8.04 Although the Committee considered, in its Draft Report, that the period
of protection should be reduced to not more than 50 years
from the year of
making, it concluded that there were reasons stemming from Australia’s
membership of the Berne Convention
which made it difficult for the provisions of
s.33 of the Act to be amended to give effect to the Committee’s
preference.
REASONS FOR COMMITTEE’S VIEW IN DRAFT
8.05 In its Draft Report, ie, before the conclusion of TRIPS, the Committee
alluded to what it understood was a possibility that
the protocol being
considered to the Berne Convention might include specific and more appropriate
protection for computer programs,
which might be of shorter duration than that
for literary works. On that basis, the Committee felt that it was worthwhile
the reasons why the Committee was of the view that protection for the
life of the author plus a further period of 50 years was too
long. Among those
who made comments on the issue, Professor Cornish, Professor-Elect of Law,
Magdalene College, University of Cambridge
(UK) urged the Committee to recommend
its preferred term of protection, ie, 50 years, on the basis that it was more
appropriate than
life of the author plus 50 years and that Berne was of doubtful
application to computer programs. Of the others to comment on this
part of the
Draft Report, most favoured the existing term of protection for literary works.
8.06 The Committee’s reasons for its view that a shorter term of
• A period of life plus 50 years is intrinsically too long a period of
protection for computer programs. By their very nature
they do not require
protection for so long. This view is widely held both in Australia and overseas.
It was reflected in many, but
by no means all, of the submissions received by
the Committee before release of its Draft Report and half of those received on
Draft Report that commented on this issue . Overseas examples of it are to
be found in the 1977 World Intellectual Property Organisation
Provisions on the Protection of
Computer Software
and in the law of
France. The Committee has considered carefully those submissions which advocate
the retention of the conventional
period of life of the author plus 50 years but
remains of the opinion that this is not only too long in an intrinsic sense but
impractical. A majority of the Committee was persuaded, notwithstanding
submissions to the contrary, that a period of 25 years from
making might be too
short and concluded that a period of 50 years from the end of the year of making
would have been a satisfactory
compromise.
• There is a particular difficulty in the area of computer programs in
defining the period of protection by reference to the
life of the author. This
arises because programs will very often be written or compiled by numerous
authors. The Act, like its overseas
counterparts, makes provision for the period
of protection of works of joint authorship; see ss.78, 79 and 80. The period is
after the death of the last surviving author; s.80. These provisions
were enacted without the problems associated with computers
and computer
programs in mind. They have usually been applied in relation to conventional
literary, musical or dramatic works. In
relation to these, they occasion little
difficulty. But many computer programs have a multiplicity of authors whose
numbers may be
measured in tens or even scores. The exercise of writing a
particular program may be spread over many months and sometimes longer.
of programmers may not remain the same throughout the entirety of the period.
Members who commenced may leave; others may
come in part way through and remain
either for the balance of the period or for part of it. Some may be employed or
retained only
to help with certain parts of the work; yet their contribution may
be of substantial importance. A joint author must have taken a
substantial part
in the creation of the work; see
Copinger and Skone James on Copyright
(12th ed., London, Sweet and Maxwell,
1980, Ch. 10
, pp.141 et seq). In some
cases a program which has been written by a number of people may not be a work
of joint authorship. Rather,
the position may be that each author (or group of
authors) has contributed a distinct part of the whole. In such a case there will
be more than one work making up the composite. Each case will depend on its own
circumstances. For present purposes it is enough
to make the point that the fact
that a work may be one of joint authorship or a composite of two or more
separate and distinct works,
demonstrates how complex the task may be of
identifying the author or authors of a program. These various considerations
that the life of the author is not a useful or an apposite guide to the
desirable period of protection. No doubt those who were responsible
earlier copyright legislation were concerned that termination of the copyright
owner’s rights on death (which was the
original law) might operate most
unjustly. That led to the addition of the 50 year period. But the technology
with which this reference
is concerned is so vastly different from what is
involved in relation to conventional works that it is essential that protection
be for a finite period not related to the lifetime of any person.
• There is a reason, stemming from the public interest, why the same
finite period of protection should be conferred in respect
of all computer
programs. The market for computer programs is a most competitive one. It is not
in the public interest that computer
programs be protected for longer than is
reasonably necessary. And it is certainly not in the public interest that
periods of protection
for different programs, perhaps competing programs, differ
according to the length of the lives of the respective authors.
• Furthermore, it is important that competitors be able to ascertain
with as much certainty as possible what the actual period
of protection in a
given case is. This is one of the benefits of the patent law in relation to
patents. There is no system of registration
of copyright either in Australia or
in most other countries. The system of registration in the United States is now
optional unless
the American owner of the copyright wishes to enforce its
rights. It will not always be an easy task to ascertain when a program
But it will be more difficult for a competitor, assuming it can identify the
author or authors of a program (itself an
almost insuperable task in this area)
to set about the task of finding out whether some or all of the authors are
alive and then,
as the decades go by, of finding out when the death of the last
survivor occurred so that the beginning of the 50 year period can
Those engaged in this task would of course come from later generations of people
than those who wrote the program. In practical
terms protection for the life of
the last surviving author plus a further period of 50 years is protection, in
the area of computer
programs, in perpetuity. In every conceivable case the
period will continue long after the program has been superseded and has become
valueless and irrelevant.
• In commenting on the Draft Report the Australian Copyright Council
(ACC) stated that they were (p.13, paragraph 62):
. . . not convinced that the existing periods (sic) of protection necessarily
inhibit the development of computer programs.
The ACC further noted that:
The Committee's remarks seem to be premised on an assumption that the
inability to copy another person's program creates an impediment
to the creation
of new programs.
The Committee acknowledges that to be the case, but points out that the
purpose of copying may be, as it is given to understand,
to study the code of
the program with a view to developing a competing product, such as can be done
with other copyright works without
fear of infringement. As will be seen in
Chapter 10, the Committee's recommendation regarding permitted decompilation of
in copyright may not extend to all possible cases of decompilation for
that purpose. If a program is out of copyright, decompilation
can be undertaken
without any possibility of infringement.
• The need to ascertain the identity of the author or authors of the
program and the date of the death of the last surviving
author may also provide
problems for copyright owners seeking to enforce their rights. If a person
claiming to be the copyright owner
of a computer program sues for infringement,
the defendant may put the plaintiff to proof of his or her title. In many cases
onus which the copyright owner has may be discharged by showing that one or
more of the authors of the program is alive. It will
not be relevant to know any
more because the period of 50 years will not have commenced to run and the
period of protection will
not have expired. But as the years go by and members
of staff leave their employment and consultants who may have taken part in the
writing of programs change their occupations and addresses, the difficulty for
some plaintiffs will increase. In an area as dynamic
as computer programs, this
may not often create a problem but it may do so in some cases and it seems to
the Committee to be very
much in the interests of copyright owners to have a
situation in which all they need prove is that the program was made in a
year and that a period of 50 years has not elapsed since that
United States—term of protection for
”works for hire”
8.07 In the course of its deliberations, the Committee also considered the
“work for hire” provisions of the United States
legislation. Section
(US) provides that, in general, copyright
in a work created on or after 1 January 1978 subsists from its creation and,
the later provisions of the section, endures for a term consisting of
the life of the author and 50 years after the author’s
death. In the case
of a joint work by authors who “did not work for hire”, the
of the life of the last surviving author
and 50 years after such last surviving author’s death. Section 302(c)
deals with anonymous
works, pseudonymous works, and works made “for
hire”. It is unnecessary to refer to the provisions concerning anonymous
and pseudonymous works but the provisions in relation to those are in many
respects similar to those which affect works “for
hire”. In relation
to such works, the copyright endures for a term of 75 years from the year of its
first publication, or a
term of 100 years from the year of its creation,
whichever expires first. Works made “for hire” are dealt with in
It provides that, in the case of a work made “for hire”,
the employer or other person for whom the work was prepared
is considered the
author and, unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise in writing signed
by them, owns all of the rights
comprised in the copyright. A work made
“for hire” is defined in s.101 of the Act. It is to be noted that
not all commissioned
works are considered to be works made “for
Nimmer On Copyright
(1992, pp.5.13 to 5.30, paragraph
5.03[B]); but it would seem from the analysis which appears there that most
commissioned programs
would be works made “for hire”.
8.08 The United States position is interesting but is not an example which it
is helpful to follow. The fixed term is applied only
in relation to “works
for hire”. Computer programs will very often be “works for
hire” but that will not
always be so. Furthermore, even if a program is a
work for hire, the periods of protection of 75 and 100 years which may then be
applicable, may not always accord with the Berne Convention. Many of the most
successful program writers have been extremely young.
Many have been in their
early twenties when the work was created. If one assumes a life expectancy of,
say, 50 years and adds a further
period of 50 years, the result substantially
exceeds the period of 75 years provided for in the legislation. 100 years may be
the mark but even it may be exceeded in some cases.
8.09 The very mention of periods of 75 and 100 years in this context lends
emphasis to the Committee’s view that a period of
the life of the author
and a further period of 50 years are just too long. Even the 50 years from the
year of making favoured by
the Committee is at the upper limit of what is
reasonable. As noted earlier, once one contemplates periods of this length for
protection of a right in property which is so dynamic, one is,
realistically, talking in terms of a period which lacks any relevant
ending. It is truly protection in perpetuity. A minority of the Committee have a
similar view about the period of protection
of 50 years. In the minority
opinion, that also is a very long time. It may not amount to protection in
perpetuity but, from a practical
point of view, it will in most cases amount to
the same thing.
8.10 Whilst all these considerations are relevant and important, the
Committee cannot put forward a recommendation that the conventional
protection for computer programs be shortened. Adherence by Australia to the
TRIPS agreement, as is the Government’s
stated intention, would prevent
the implementation of any such recommendation. For reasons already alluded to in
paragraph 8.01 and
fully elaborated in Chapter 4, the obligations to be taken on
by Australia under TRIPS will preclude the further contemplation of
of protection of anything short of life/lives of the author/s plus 50 years.
Accordingly, the Committee has reluctantly
concluded that the provisions of s.33
of the Act, subject to what has been said about unpublished works, must remain
as they are
(Recommendation 2.06(b)).
8.11 In its Draft Report, the Committee expressed the hope that within Berne
and at other international meetings and conventions,
Australia would seek to
achieve agreement on a much shorter period of protection than that which is
presently provided for, and agreement
with the submission dated 14 July 1992 by
the Australian Government to WIPO on the possible protocol to Berne in so far as
it included
the proposal of a 50 years’ fixed term of protection for
computer programs. However with the conclusion of TRIPS, that seems
a vain hope,
however compelling the Committee believes the case to be.
Exclusive Rights
ECONOMIC RIGHTS
9.01 The exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in a literary work are
(the Act). In the case of
a literary work, those rights are the exclusive right to:
(a) reproduce the work in a material form;
(b) publish the work;
(c) perform the work in public;
(d) broadcast the work;
(e) cause the work to be transmitted to subscribers to a diffusion
(f) make an adaptation of the work; and
(g) do any of acts (a) to (e) in relation to an adaptation of the work.
Section 31(2) provides that the generality of the right of reproduction is
not affected by the express right to make an adaptation.
9.02 Submissions to the Committee made prior to the Draft Report did not
specify the appropriate bundle of rights that should be afforded
to the owner of
accepted that the owner of copyright
in a computer program should enjoy all the
rights that subsist in literary works. Submissions made following the Draft
Report mostly
endorsed the recommendations of the Committee in relation to the
exclusive rights of copyright owners of computer programs. A number
submissions did suggest that the owner of copyright in a computer program should
also have the additional right to control the
rental of his or her computer
programs. The requirement of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPS) embodied in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that a rental right be introduced is discussed at
9.77–9.85 (See Chapter 3 for full discussion of the TRIPS
Agreement).
9.03 As noted in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.04), the Committee reached the
conclusion in the Draft Report that computer programs in source
not also in object code—were required to be protected as literary works
under the Berne Convention for the Protection
of Literary and Artistic Works
(Berne Convention). As made clear by the discussion in Chapter 4, the
finalisation of the TRIPS Agreement
now puts an end to all speculation on this
matter by “emphatically requiring all forms of computer programs to be
as literary works under the Berne Convention” by virtue of
art.10(1) (paragraph 4.05).
9.04 The Berne Convention prescribes certain minimum standards of protection
as well as the various exclusive rights authors enjoy
in respect of their works.
The need to have regard to the requirements of the Berne Convention and now the
TRIPS Agreement in relation
to, in particular, the exclusive rights, has
precluded the Committee from recommending against certain of those rights in
of computer programs.
9.05 The Committee also notes that the unique nature of computer programs as
perform certain functions,
means that not all aspects of computer programs will readily come within the
scope of copyright protection.
In particular, this is evident when consideration
is given to the scope of the reproduction right and its application in respect
of the “look and feel”, “user interface”,
“non-literal elements” and the “structure sequence
organisation” of computer programs. It is clear from a consideration of
these aspects of computer programs that some may
be regarded as commercially
valuable and deserving of protection. However, it can be argued that some of
them fall outside the proper
scope of copyright protection. The Committee does
not regard this fact as a consideration which necessarily warrants amendments to
the Act. It notes that the scope of protection afforded under each of the
various statutory intellectual and industrial property
regimes has its own
limitations. This simply reflects the nature of that protection.
THE RIGHT TO REPRODUCE A COMPUTER PROGRAM IN A
MATERIAL FORM
9.06 The right to reproduce a work in a material form is fundamental to the
protection of authors. Without this right authors would
be unable to effectively
exploit their works. The Committee received the clear impression from all that
it heard and read that the
right to control reproduction was the pre-eminent
concern—indeed almost the only concern—of computer program
However, the determination of whether a program has been copied by
another program is often a highly technical and more complex exercise
determining whether a book or song has been plagiarised. This is not to suggest
that copyright infringement concerning traditional
forms of works is not
difficult; the Committee simply wishes to emphasise just how difficult the issue
of copyright infringement
concerning computer programs can be by any standards.
This is inevitable given the extremely technical and complex nature of programs.
The facts of
Autodesk Inc
Martin Dyason and others
(High Court decision: (No 1)
[1992] HCA 2
(1992) 173 CLR
22 IPR 163)
already discussed from paragraph 5.06 are by no means
exceptional amongst computer program cases in their complexity; they are fairly
9.07 The Committee notes that the intense focus of industry and users on the
reproduction right arises from several considerations.
First and most obvious is
that the ubiquity of and investment in computers mean that the scale of
investment in development and marketing
of programs is vast, with the result
that the proprietors of successful programs stand to suffer great loss if not
protected from
competition from unauthorised copies. More importantly, from a
social perspective, large scale unauthorised copying will stifle development
new programs because program writers will be unable to reap just rewards for
their labours. Next, the technology of computers
means that, in most cases,
copying of programs can be accomplished effortlessly and instantaneously.
Indeed, copying is part of the
normal use of most, if not all, programs. The
competition amongst program producers is vigorous: whenever that is the case
producers of intellectual property, the field of competitors is bound to
include imitators and copyists. Because of the functional
purpose of computer
programs, once a particular feature becomes standardised by popularity amongst
users, eg, the graphic user interface,
the competition to win market share will
inevitably mean a convergence between rival products and a consequent increase
in the incentive
for copying. Finally, because of the nature of computer
programs—the Committee has in mind the evolution from source code to
finished product, and the fact that many programs in fact comprise collections
of modules which are themselves programs—the
possibilities of copying,
inadvertent or deliberate, by a competitor seem to be very great.
9.08 Having regard to the negative effects uncontrolled copying of computer
programs would have on the incentive to develop new and
improved versions, and
the losses that would be sustained by authors, the Committee recommends that the
author of a computer program
should have the exclusive right to control the
reproduction of his or her work (Recommendation 2.08). The Committee believes
its recommendation in relation to the definition of reproduction, set out
in Chapter 6 in paragraphs 6.55 and 6.76 will considerably
strengthen the rights
of the owners of copyright in computer programs, as well as authors and owners
of copyright in other types
of works. However, that is not the end, but only the
beginning, of consideration of this right as it applies to computer programs.
The following discussion sets out, in simple terms, the Committee’s
understanding of the nature of computer programs. It is
the unique nature of
computer programs, amongst other works protected by copyright, that gives rise
to particular difficulties in
determining the appropriate scope of the
reproduction right for programs.
The nature of computer programs
9.09 In March 1991 the Committee’s Secretary attended a World
Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) symposium in San Francisco
examined intellectual property issues raised by artificial intelligence. At that
symposium Professor Randall Davis, of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology,
delivered a paper entitled “Intellectual Property and Software: the
assumptions are broken”
(WIPO Worldwide Symposium on the Intellectual
Property Aspects of Artificial Intelligence
, WIPO, Geneva, 1991). In his
paper Professor Davis makes the point that not only are computer programs text
(embodied in code) but
that they also behave (p.110):
. . . [the] text-like aspects [of the program] can be accommodated by
traditional copyright concepts and vocabulary. [But] a second,
important, thing about a program is its behaviour: a program exists in order to
get the computer to
something (‘bring about a certain
result’). A word processing program can for instance, insert text, delete
it, move it, align the margins, etc.
9.10 Professor Davis noted that both the “literal” (ie, textual)
elements of a program and its behavioural elements possess
their own structure,
sequence and organisation, and that each class of elements is, to the user,
independent of the other. He illustrated
this fact by using the example of a
word processing program. Two of the behaviours (or functions) of a typical word
processing program
are deleting words and deleting paragraphs. If the text of
such a program were written out in source code one might find that the
the “delete word” function precedes the code for the “delete
paragraph” function. However, the sequence
of those two routines, ie, the
order in which they appear in the source code, can be altered without changing
the behaviour of the
program in any way. Accordingly, a user of two such
programs would be unable to tell which of the two programs he or she was using
because, although the structure, sequence and organisation of the
differed, the structure, sequence, and organisation of the
would remain the same.
9.11 To further illustrate the degree of independence of these two aspects of
computer programs, Professor Davis made the following
observation. A user may
become very familiar with the structure, sequence and organisation of a
program’s behaviour to the
extent that he or she might claim to know very
well what the program can do. However, this in itself will not give the user any
of what the program code looks like. In other words the program’s
behaviour tells a user nothing about the text of the program.
9.12 The Committee accepts Professor Davis’ analysis of computer
programs. From that analysis it is clear that computer programs
features in common with traditional literary works, and others that are not.
Those features of a computer program that
comprise its text or code (whether
source or object code) lend themselves to comparison with elements of
traditional literary works,
while those features that can be described as its
behaviour do not.
The meaning of “look and feel”,
“user interface”, “non-literal elements” and
”structure,
sequence and organisation”
9.13 From submissions made to the Committee and from the reasoning adopted in
several judicial decisions overseas, there appears to
be some confusion as to
what features of a computer program can be considered for the purpose of
establishing whether or not it has
been infringed by the creation of another
computer program. The owners of copyright in computer programs have sought to
protect such
things as the “look and feel”, “user
interface”, “non-literal elements” and “structure,
sequence and organisation” of computer programs from being copied. In its
1990 submission Sun Microsystems Australia Pty Ltd
(Sun Microsystems) noted that
It is not clear if the concept of ‘look and feel’ of software is
the idea or the expression of the idea.
Before considering whether copyright protection should extend to any of these
features of a computer program, the Committee will express
its understanding of
each of them for the purposes of this report.
“Look and feel” and the “user
9.14 The concepts of “look and feel” and the “user
interface” are peculiar to computer software. The “look
feel” or “user interface” of a traditional literary work is
not, so far as the Committee is aware, normally
a matter for consideration in
actions for infringement of copyright in such works. However, it has been made
very clear to the Committee
that the “look and feel” or “user
interface” of a computer program is the distinguishing feature as far as
most, if not all, users are concerned. This reflects the functional nature of
computer programs.
9.15 Unlike even the most utilitarian traditional literary work, eg, an
instruction manual for an electrical appliance, a computer
program is not bought
to be read, but to drive a machine or, more precisely, to cause it to perform
specified functions. Indeed,
if one viewed in hardcopy or on the screen the
object code of a computer program, it would necessarily be a low level
representation
of the electrical impulses comprising the program and, as such,
would be meaningless to the average computer user. It would be a
representation
of “on” and “off” commands, comparable to the
“long” and “short” signals
of morse code transmission,
except that the latter when decoded comprises words conveying a message
comprehensible to and intended
for humans, whereas the former does not. This
serves to emphasise that programs are normally acquired for what they can make a
do, and not for any information they contain (the Committee here
distinguishes the program itself from any data accompanying it).
So, as between
competing programs that cause a computer to perform similar functions, selection
is often made according to how easy,
or “user friendly”, each one
looks and feels to use.
9.16 In some submissions to the Committee, the terms “look and
feel” and the “user interface” were both used
to describe what
were referred to as the “non-literal elements” of a computer
program, which the Committee took to be
a reference to elements other than the
words, digits or symbols comprising the text or code of the program. In its
submission to
the Committee, Lotus submitted that the “look and
feel” of a program includes such things as the menu, command structure,
including the choice of command terms, the structure and order of those terms,
their presentation on the screen and the long prompts
(these features seem to
encompass aspects of the structure, sequence and organisation of the behaviour
of a program but not the code
itself). However, Lotus Development Pty Ltd
(Lotus) suggested that the term “look and feel” was not entirely
appropriate
to describe the “non-literal elements” of computer
programs and that they were better described by the term “user
interface”.
9.17 The meaning of “user interface” is defined, in simple terms,
in a position paper prepared by the League for Programming
Freedom (LPF) and
submitted to the Committee by Associate Professor G Doherty of the Department of
Computing Science of the University
of Wollongong. However, the Committee has
adopted the definition used in the IEEE Standard Glossary of Software
Engineering Terminology
(Std 610.12–1990), now Australian Standard
3611—Glossary of Software Engineering 1993) which provides that a
interface” is (AS 3611–p. 78):
An interface that enables information to be passed between a human user and
hardware or software components of a computer system.
“Structure, sequence and organisation of
computer programs” and “non-literal elements”
9.18 The Committee notes that American cases concerning the copying of
computer programs that discuss the issue of “look and
often referred to the “structure, sequence and organisation” of
programs. It is clear that the text
(code) and the behaviour (function) of a
computer program will each have their own separate “structure, sequence
and organisation”.
In relation to the code, the Committee understands that
“structure, sequence and organisation” can be roughly equated
organisation and layout of chapters, sections, index and accompanying
illustrations, maps and diagrams in a book of a technical
nature. In this
regard, the Committee notes the view of Mr Daniel Hunter in his article
“‘Look and feel’ Computer
Australian Intellectual Property Journal
at 76 that:
Creating the structure, interaction of modules, and organisation of the
program forms one of the most time-consuming and expensive
components of
programming. By adopting structured programming methods, actual coding is almost
trivial since the structure determines
which instructions to use and where they
should be placed.
The submission of IBM Australia Limited (IBM) referred to at paragraph 9.34
also argues this point.
9.19 On the other hand, the “structure sequence and organisation”
of the behaviour of the program are those features which
give it its user appeal
or “friendliness” and are most easily identified with its
“look and feel”. As noted
above in paragraph 9.16 this includes such
things as individual screen icons, screen displays and the sequence of screen
a user accesses when using the computer. The Committee regards these
behavioural aspects of a computer program as its non-code or
non-textual
(“non-literal”) elements.
9.20 As mentioned in paragraph 9.16 Lotus submitted that the term “look
and feel” was not entirely appropriate to describe
“non-literal” aspects of a computer program. The non-literal
elements of a computer program are understood by the
Committee to be those
elements of a program that are independent of, or exist at a higher level of
abstraction than, the actual program
code (either source or object). As such,
the “non-literal elements” of a program will include both the
structure, sequence
and organisation of a program’s behaviour and the
structure, sequence and organisation of its underlying code as separate
To the extent that the term “non-literal elements”
includes aspects of a program’s behavioural structure, sequence
organisation, it is clear that it overlaps with the concepts of “look and
feel” and the “user interface”.
On the other hand those
aspects such as the “structure sequence and organisation” of the
program’s code do not.
9.21 Some comment was made in submissions on the Committee’s discussion
and use of the expression “structure, sequence
and organisation” in
the Draft Report. Of these Mr Hunter asserted that the Committee “seemed
unable to make a clear
distinction between program structure and look and
feel” (p.5) and the Supporters of Interoperable Systems in Australia
recommended that the Committee should avoid the use of the expression
“structure, sequence and organisation” in reference
program’s code or behaviour and should instead refer to “non-literal
elements” which they asserted encompassed
the internal structure of a
program, its interface specifications and the non-literal aspects of a
program’s user interface
(paragraph 2.20, p. 5). SISA did however also
refer to paragraph 9.19 of the Draft Report in which the Committee recognised
very point. Despite the concerns expressed in these submissions,
submissions from De Data Pty Ltd, the Australian Copyright Council
Alcatel Australia Ltd and the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers
Association (CBEMA) supported the Committee’s
recommendation in the Draft
Report that “look and feel” not be given express copyright
protection.
Definition and interpretation of terms
9.22 The Committee notes that at the date of this report the courts in
Australia have not had occasion to consider the meaning of
any of these terms.
Indeed, having regard to the wide range of applications each of the terms has in
common usage, the task of defining
each term is particularly difficult and any
definitions are likely to be of only limited utility. The Committee notes that
the terms encompasses the “behavioural manifestations” of a
computer program. It appears to the Committee that it is
the protection of these
“behavioural manifestations” of a computer program that has been the
main concern of copyright
owners who have sought to protect the “look and
feel”, “user interface”, “non-literal elements”
“structure sequence and organisation” of their programs.
Protection beyond the code
9.23 Applying the analysis of computer programs set out in paragraphs
9.09–9.12 to what is encompassed by “look and feel”
clearer picture of those aspects of computer programs which are currently
protected and those features that are not. It also
raises the question whether
those features not protected by copyright might nonetheless require protection.
The Committee notes that
the “non-literal elements” of computer
programs comprising the “structure sequence and organisation” of the
program code (see paragraph 9.20) as distinguished from the structure, sequence
and organisation of the program’s behaviour
lend themselves to protection
by copyright in the same manner and to the same extent as the structure,
sequence and organisation
of traditional literary works. For this reason it does
not consider it necessary to recommend any change to the Act in this respect.
already noted, computer programs provide particular challenges to courts seeking
to determining questions of infringement. However,
the Committee is of the view
that it is undesirable and unnecessary to include specific provisions in the Act
codifying either tests
or standards for courts to apply in determining whether
Protection of “look and feel”
Protection of “look and feel”
internationally
9.24 The Committee is aware of recent developments in the USA concerning the
protection of “look and feel” and the “non-literal”
copying of computer programs. A useful summary and analysis of most of the
recent cases is contained in the two-part article by Mr
Hunter, already referred
to at paragraph 9.18. The Committee does not propose to analyse in detail the
particular lines of cases
that have been decided in the US. It makes reference
to some of them here only to note those decisions that have been helpful and
instructive in its consideration of the issues of “look and feel”
and the protection of “non-literal elements”
of computer
9.25 The scope of copyright protection of the “structure sequence and
organisation” of the code of a computer program
(its “non-literal
elements”) was considered in the US by the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit in the case of
Computer Associates
International, Inc
982 F. 2d 693
1992); 23 IPR 385
Associates case)
9.26 In its decision, the Second Circuit propounded a three-step
abstraction–filtration–comparison test for determining
substantial similarity existed between the original and the allegedly infringing
programs. This test can be summarised
as follows:
Abstraction.
The program is broken down into various levels
of abstraction or layers. At the lowest level is the actual program code; higher
include submodules and modules up to components, and finally higher level
functional design. The higher one goes up through the level
of abstraction, the
more ideas are found and the less expression of ideas.
Filtration.
The second stage of the process is to remove the
non-protectable material from protectable expression. In its decision the court
various unprotectable elements. These included:
(a) elements dictated by external factors, such as the mechanical
specifications of the computer on which the program was to run,
compatibility
requirements with other programs, design standards and industry demands; and
(b) elements dictated by efficiency. In this regard the court found that
some elements, not constrained by external considerations,
were dictated by
efficiency considerations. These included the design choices available to
programmers notwithstanding the fact that
hypothetically there might be a myriad
of ways in which a certain set of functions could be given effect within a
program. In other
words, where a particular implementation is driven by
efficiency concerns that narrow the range of choice so as to make only one
two forms of expression workable options, the doctrine of merger
applied—the idea has merged with its expression.
Comparison.
The final step of the test is to compare what remains
at each level of abstraction to determine what, if any, of the protectable
has been copied.
9.27 The Committee has considered the approach adopted by the Court in the
Computer Associates case
. It regards the test set out by the court in
that case as a very practical and useful guide for determining infringement of
programs and supports the approach it adopted. The Committee also notes
that the analysis undertaken by the court at first instance
relied heavily on
expert assistance provided by Professor Randall Davis whose ideas the Committee
has referred to in paragraphs 9.09–9.12.
Computer Associates case
has been applied in subsequent cases
in the US, UK and Canada. SISA listed some of these in its 1993 submission to
the Committee
following the Draft Report. Decisions of the US Circuit Court of

plaintiff’s computer program. O’Leary

abstraction–filtration test in the
Computer Associates case
while not expressly adopting the test, did endorse its underlying principle.
9.31 Arguments for and against the protection of non-literal aspects of
computer programs were not fully developed in submissions
to the Committee.
Possibly the main reason for this was that the concept was not clearly defined
or well understood within the industry.
However, one relevant decision, namely
the case of
Lotus Development Corporation
Paperback Software
International and Stephenson Software Ltd
740 F. Supp 37 (D.
[1990] FCA 5
) was referred to the Committee (by the representative
for Lotus). It was also referred to by Dawson J in the
Autodesk case
CLR at 345;
[1992] HCA 2
at 172. In that case Lotus sued Paperback Software which
had independently created a version of the Lotus 1–2–3 spreadsheet
program without copying any code. The Court found infringement on the basis that
the menu structure as a whole—viz, the structure
and order of the terms,
the presentation of the menu on the screen, the choice of commands and the text
in the long prompts of the
menu—was copyright expression and the
defendants had admitted copying these features of the program.
9.32 The Committee notes that the facts of the
are similar
to those in the case of
Digital Communications Associates, Inc
Softklone Distributing Corporation
659 F. Supp 449 (N.
D. Ga. 1987);
). In that case Softklone developed a functional
equivalent of a program marketed by Digital Communications Associates (DCA)
Crosstalk XVI. Softklone’s program was called Mirror. The court
found, amongst other things, that copyright in the Crosstalk
XVI program was not
infringed by the screen display generated by the Mirror program because it was
not a direct copy or reproduction
of Crosstalk’s literary or substantive
content. The screen display was not a copy because it could be generated by a
of different computer programs.
9.33 The Committee is of the view that from a copyright policy perspective
the approach of the court in the
, which distinguishes the
protection of screen displays from the protection of the computer
program’s code, is to be preferred
to that of the court in the
. The Committee now proceeds to consider arguments for and against the
protection of the “look and feel” of computer programs.
Arguments in favour of protecting “look and
9.34 In their submissions, both Lotus and IBM indicated their support for the
protection of the “user interface”. Lotus
argued that the
intellectual creativity involved in developing a computer program is not
adequately protected unless it is recognised
that copyright extends to the
“non-literal elements” of the computer program. Lotus also submitted
that (1990, p. 3):
. . . it is widely recognised that the design of the user interface is a task
which often requires greater creativity, originality
and insight than the actual
writing of the code.
This claim was echoed by an argument presented by IBM that, in developing
computer programs (1989, p. 15):
The final step in the process—and the only one that software developers
routinely entrust to junior programmers—is the
coding step. ... [T]he
coding is a form of authorship least difficult to master.
IBM submitted that the “structure, sequence and organisation” of
computer programs should be protected under copyright
law. IBM also stated that
the position in Australia does not seem to be certain on the question whether
the reproduction right might
extend to non-literal copying of a type not
specifically provided for in the Act. Consequently IBM invited the Committee to
that if the existing law does not provide this protection, then
“consideration should be given to expressly legislating in
regard” (1989, p. 22). The view was expressed by IBM that the
“adaptation” right was the most likely vehicle
to afford this
protection provided that there was sufficient indication in paragraph (ba) of
the definition in s.10 (1) of the Act
that this was the intention of
Parliament.
Arguments against protecting “look and
Standardisation.
The LPF Position Paper provided to the
Committee by Associate Professor Doherty states that copyright protection for
user interfaces
will promote diversity but makes the point that this is not
necessarily a desirable result. The position paper notes that (p. 3):
Computer users want consistency in user interfaces as this promotes ease of
Similarly, Fujitsu Australia Ltd note in their submission of 4 October 1990
that (p. 13):
. . . users expect and demand basic similarities in the sequence of displays
and in the syntax or meaning of commands, (eg, “scroll
“close–icons”) when invoking similar functions.
Retarding development in the industry.
In their supplementary
submission dated 30 October 1990, Gilbert and Tobin Lawyers, acknowledge the
remarks of Keeton DJ in the
that “. . . the clever
arrangement of the user interface can be the key to higher user
acceptance” but note that there
are “persuasive arguments against
allowing it copyright protection” namely (p. 10–11):
Protecting software structure, sequencing, commands and language could
rapidly exhaust those alternatives [and lead] . . . to more
convoluted and
inefficient structures. . .
The Committee assumes that this reference includes not only the structure of
the text of the program but also the “dynamic structure”
behaviour of the program. The LPF submits that (p. 5):
Due to the evolutionary nature of interface development, interface copyright
will actually retard progress.
The position paper states (p. 6):
. . . the Macintosh interface was based on ideas tried previously by Xerox
and SRI, and before that by the Stanford Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory.
Protection of “look and feel”:
consideration of the arguments
9.37 Regarding IBM’s contention that the adaptation right may afford
this protection, it is the Committee’s opinion that
a program code that
produces a similar “look and feel” or “user interface”
to that generated by another program
code cannot be regarded as an adaptation of
the original code, where the later code is original, ie, has not copied or
the earlier code. If the non-code elements of a program are truly to
be characterised as behaviour, the Committee has strong reservations
desirability of seeking to use the adaptation right as a means of protecting the
behaviour of a computer program. In the
Committee’s view there is an
insufficient nexus between the source code or object code on the one hand and
the program’s
behaviour on the other to justify protection of the former
extending to the latter. As stated earlier, observing the behaviour or
of a computer program does not reveal anything about either the object code or
the source code.
9.38 Copyright protection should be confined to the expression of ideas in a
material form and not extend to protection of behavioural
aspects of programs.
This is not to deny that any case can be made out for the protection of the
behavioural aspect of computer programs—protection
of screen displays is
further considered below (paragraph 9.43). However, it seems to the Committee
that the true goal of those seeking
to protect “non-code”
behavioural aspects of computer programs is to prevent the development of
competitive functional
equivalents. The making of functional equivalents by
cloning or reproducing substantial parts of the source or object code of a
can be properly prevented by the copyright owner using his or her
exclusive right to reproduce or make an adaptation of the program.
However, the
Committee questions whether the author of a computer program should be able to
prevent the development of functional
equivalents which are independently
created in circumstances where neither the source or object code has been
copied. The protection
of function is not and should not be an object of
9.39 The Committee is also persuaded of the desirability for standard
“look and feel” or “user interface”
features to promote
consistency and ease of use in a rapidly developing area. In particular, the
Committee notes the dangers to the
industry as a whole in encouraging diversity
for diversity’s sake, where the resulting variations do not result in the
efficient and acceptable “user interface” features being used
or developed, simply because the most efficient and user
friendly features have
determining protection of
other categories of works, that it is in the case of
computer programs serves to mark these out on account of their functional
9.40 Determining the scope of rights that should be afforded to copyright
owners is a question of balancing the competing interests
of the copyright owner
with those of society as a whole. As regards balancing the needs of the public
against those of the software
industry and other author interests, the
Committee, while acknowledging the creativity that can be devoted to developing
new standards
in user interfaces, notes the behavioural nature of “look
and feel” and considers that it is inappropriate for copyright
to extend beyond expression of an idea to the behavioural aspects of computer
programs. If a book that taught a method
of doing something, such as
constructing a particular piece of furniture, enabled the reader to achieve the
same effective result
as an earlier book that taught a different method of
construction, the fact that use of the later book enabled the same finished
product to be built would not (and should not) make it an infringement of the
earlier one. Further, where such protection, if it
did extend to behaviour,
would impede or cause a developing industry to become less efficient,
consideration must also be given to
the underlying goals and fundamental
principles of copyright. As noted by the US Court of Appeals in the
Associates case
982 F. 2d 693
The interest of the copyright law is not in simply conferring a monopoly on
industrious persons, but in advancing the public welfare
through rewarding
artistic creativity, in a manner that permits the free use and development of
non-protectable ideas and processes.
Thus, where copyright protection would not advance the overriding
“public welfare” it should not be granted.
9.41 If a new method or device for improving the ease of using a programmed
computer is introduced, eg, the mouse for facilitating
the movement of the
cursor on the screen, then the Committee believes that the law of patents is the
appropriate recourse for protection
of such inventive effort. This does not
conflict with the view just expressed because the term of a patent is much
shorter than that
for copyright, reflecting the policy that the term of the
monopoly conferred on the inventor by a patent should not deprive others
chance of manufacturing a competing product, or the public from benefiting from
such competition, for an unduly long period—
certainly nothing like the
period of copyright protection for literary works.
Recommendation: protection of “look and
9.42 In the Committee’s view the need for standardisation and the need
for efficient user interfaces to be used and developed
outweighs the need to
grant authors express copyright protection in the “look and feel” of
their programs’ behaviour.
For the reasons given above the Committee is of
the view that no amendments should be made to the Act to establish additional
for the “look and feel” of computer programs
(Recommendation 2.09).
Protection of screen displays
9.43 The Committee’s conclusion that the “look and feel” of
computer programs amounts to behaviour and as such should
not be protected by
the “look and feel”,
does not dispose of the question of what
protection, if any, should be afforded to screen displays.
9.44 Submissions received by the Committee prior to the Draft Report
concerning look and feel did not canvass the issue of the protection
displays in any detail. Nor did they propose any special form of protection. In
the Draft Report the Committee commented
that it understood that most screen
displays are not stored in computer memory. Screen displays may be generated
either by retrieving
data stored in some form of machine memory or generated
using a computer program. (The Committee has noted the subsequent submission
IBM that screen displays are stored in computer memory). Which of either of
these two categories a particular screen display falls
into will depend on the
nature of what is being displayed, and in some cases, the nature of the program
being used. Screen displays
generated by a computer program can be characterised
as part of the program’s behaviour. The question which arises in this
context is whether this particular form of program behaviour should be
protected. The issues concerning the protection of these types
displays are different to those that apply where the screen display is generated
by the retrieval of a work that is stored
in computer memory. In respect of such
displays the issue of protection is relatively straight forward. Where copyright
in the work that is being displayed, the unauthorised copying of the
screen display of the work will infringe copyright in the work.
9.45 However, the protection of screen displays that are generated by
computer programs is less certain. There is some doubt as to
whether screen
displays generated by a computer program would fall within the definition of an
artistic work in s.10(1) of the Act.
It is arguable that they do not come within
the ordinary meaning of the words “painting” or
“drawing” used
in the definition. There must also be doubt that
artistic copyright could subsist in such display alone, for it to do so the
must have been “made” (s.32) and making requires reduction
to a material form (s.22(1)). As has already been noted, the
definition of
“material form” in s.10(1) which is inclusive not exhaustive,
requires a form of storage, and the ephemeral
nature of computer-generated
screen displays would appear to fail to satisfy this requirement. Furthermore,
it is unlikely that such
screen displays are protected as cinematograph films
because the definition of a cinematograph film in s.10(1) provides, in part,
“cinematograph film” means the aggregate of the visual images
embodied in an article or thing . . .
Accordingly, where the visual images that make up the screen display are not
stored in computer memory, the requirement under the
definition that visual
in an article or thing would not appear to be met.
9.46 The Committee notes that in the US, under its
limited recognition of the special nature of screen displays appears to have
been afforded by their treatment as “audio–visual
works” which
are entitled to copyright protection (s.102(a)(6)). Nonetheless, protection of
screen displays in the US is not
automatic and as IBM indicated in its October
1993 submission, the courts in the US have not been unanimous in their response
whether screen displays are a separate work entitled to protection. IBM noted
that the US Register of Copyright’s view in his
June 1988 decision was
that a computer program together, with its screen display, was a single work and
should therefore be given
a single registration (Registration and Deposit of
Computer Screen Displays, 53 Fed. Reg. 21 817, 21 819 (1988)). This decision is
reflected in the US Copyright Office’s Circular No 61 (last revised in
November 1993) which sets out the requirements for registration
of computer
programs and indicates that a single registration application for a computer
program will “cover any copyrightable
authorship contained in the computer
program and screen displays”.
9.47 In the Draft Report the Committee invited submissions on the need for a
similar form of protection for screen displays in Australia.
The Committee
received 12 submissions that addressed this issue but the views were divided in
their response on this issue, though
those in favour of some form of protection
were in the majority. However, Oracle Systems (Australia) Pty Ltd (Oracle) and
Council of Australia (LCA) were clearly opposed to a form of protection
arising independently of protection for the computer program.
The LCA submitted
that copyright protection of a screen display would give de facto protection to
“look and feel”. This
coincides with the Committee’s view that
some displays are an aspect of the program’s behaviour. Two concerns
in other submissions were that any independent protection for a screen
display not be greater than for the underlying program (SISA)
and that new areas
of artistic expression not be excluded arbitrarily from copyright protection,
such as multimedia screen displays
(ACC and Australian Pay TV Pty Limited
9.48 Having considered these submissions and in light of the discussion in
paragraphs 9.44–9.45 the Committee has decided not
to recommend any
additional form of protection for screen displays (Recommendation 2.10).
Design protection for screen displays
9.49 It remains to be noted that Sun Microsystems suggested that, to avoid
blatant copying, protection should be afforded under the
law of registered
designs to the screen displays generated by programs. However, as mentioned in
paragraph 4.16, a recent application
for the registration of an icon as a design
was rejected by the Registrar of Designs, on the grounds that the icon was not
of distinguishing the computer screen because the image was transitory
Re Applications by Comshare Inc.
[1991] ADO 2
(1991) 23 IPR 145).
A majority of the
Committee shares the view that it is reasonable to reject such an application
because an icon or small picture
on the screen does not distinguish a physical
object like a computer screen as it is not always displayed on the computer
However, a majority of the Committee notes that such an icon or even a
complete screen display can adequately distinguish a computer
program because
the program can be so written that the icon is always on the screen when the
program is in use. A majority of the
Committee assumes that insofar as an icon
produced by a program is a registered trade mark, appropriate protection as such
be provided for under the
Trade Marks Act 1955
9.50 The Committee notes that the decision of the Registrar of Designs brings
into question whether computer generated screen displays
can ever qualify for
registration under the
Designs Act 1906
. In the Draft Report the
Committee also noted that the
Designs Act 1906
is under wholesale review
by the Law Reform Commission. Since the Committee released its Draft Report, the
Law Reform Commission
has released a Discussion Paper on Designs which proposes
some changes to the existing legislation, including the definition of
(Discussion Paper 58, August 1994). The issue of possible
design protection for screen displays is not mentioned in the Discussion
However, the Discussion Paper proposes a new definition of “design”
which removes the reference to “applicable
to an article” and is
instead more broadly defined as:
The appearance of a product [being any manufactured thing], as perceived
visually, constitutes a design and a new definition of manufactured
A thing is a manufactured thing whether it has been made wholly by the use of
machinery, partly by the use of machinery and partly
by hand, or wholly by
It would appear from the above definitions that a computer program would fall
within the broad definition of a manufactured thing.
However, it is questionable
whether a screen display would correctly be regarded as the appearance of the
computer program. As stated
above it is a manifestation of the program’s
behaviour. (If a computer program has any appearance it would seem to be the
code and that is already protected by copyright.) Regardless of how the
above definitions may be interpreted the Committee is of
the view that designs
protection is an inappropriate way to protect screen displays.
THE RIGHT TO MAKE AN ADAPTATION OF A COMPUTER
9.51 The scope of the adaptation right under the Act and its application to
computer programs has already been discussed in Chapter
6 in relation to the
1984 amendment to the definition of adaptation (See paragraphs 6.63–6.85).
It is sufficient to note here
that, since releasing the Draft Report, the
Committee has reconsidered the question whether any change should be made to the
definitions of “reproduction” and “adaptation”
in the Act. In Chapter 6 the Committee has recommended (Recommendation
2.04(e)(ii)) that the Act be amended by the addition of a deeming provision to
provide that, in relation to a computer program, a
reproduction includes (but is
not limited to) (paragraph 6.76):
(a) an object code version of the program that has been derived from the
program in source code by compilation; and
(b) a source code version of the program that has been derived from the
program in object code by decompilation.
9.52 The consequence of introducing this provision is, as noted in paragraph
6.77, that the scope of the adaptation right in relation
to computer programs
will be narrowed and apply only in specific instances to certain translations of
computer programs, eg, from
one source code language to another and new versions
of a program obtained after porting or error correction.
9.53 The Committee recommends that copyright owners should have the right to
control the adaptation of their computer programs (Recommendation
2.11(a)). The
Committee recognises that computer programs can be “translated”
relatively easily from one language to
another (in either source or object
code), and that to the extent that they are not reproductions, such translations
constitute adaptations
of the original program. The unauthorised appropriation
of the skill and labour of the author of the original program in this manner
should be an activity which the author can control. To the extent that such
activity does not amount to reproducing the programs,
the Committee regards an
adaptation right as an important supplement to the reproduction right. The
Committee’s recommendation
for preservation of the existing definition of
“adaptation” and to add a definition of “reproduction”
intended to clarify those activities which come within these exclusive rights
of the copyright owner (See recommendations 2.04(e)
and 2.04(f)).
Rights in respect of an adaptation
9.54 It remains to be recalled that, as noted in paragraph 6.72, under
s.31(1)(a)(vii) of the Act the adaptation right is limited
to the right to make
an adaptation of the original work. The adaptation right does not extend to
preventing the making of adaptations
of adaptations. In other words the author
of a book in English may exercise his or her exclusive right to make an
adaptation by translating
the book into another language. If the author permits
another person to translate his book into German, and a third person translates
the German version into Spanish, or writes a play in German based on the German
translation, the author would be unable to prevent
these acts.
9.55 The Committee notes that s.31(2) of the Act provides that the adaptation
right is not intended to reduce the scope of the reproduction
Accordingly, in the example given above where the third person mentioned makes
an English translation of the German translation
(of the original English book),
that translation may amount to a reproduction of the original work
notwithstanding the fact that
it is also an adaptation of the German
translation. In such circumstances the question whether the English translation
of the German
translation amounted to an infringing copy of the original English
book would depend upon the author of the original work being able
to establish
that unauthorised copying (direct or indirect) occurred in the making of the
English translation. The Committee queries
whether, in the absence of any
evidence of actual copying, indirect copying should be inferred.
9.56 It was suggested to the Committee by the ACC in their response to the
Draft Report that (p.15, paragraph 72):
. . . it would be open to argue that copyright is infringed by an indirect
adaptation — that is, an adaptation made from an
intermediate item. The
proposition is that an infringing adaptation may be made without direct access
to the work, in a similar way
that an infringing reproduction may be made
without direct access to the work provided a causal connection can be shown.
If the Committee’s recommendation regarding the definition of
“reproduction” in relation to computer programs were
adopted, the
owner of copyright in a computer program would have clear control over the
making of adaptations of either the source
code or object code version of their
programs and it would be unnecessary to argue infringement based on the making
of an indirect
adaptation, as suggested by the ACC.
9.57 In the Draft Report, the Committee considered how the analogy of
translation in paragraphs 9.54–9.55 reproduced above might
computer programs. The Committee then referred to the operation of s.31(2) of
the Act which provides, in effect, that the
generality of the reproduction right
is not affected by the adaptation right. Applying this section the Committee
concluded in the
Draft Report (paragraph 9.48):
Accordingly, all versions of a program in object code which reproduce or
substantially reproduce that object code version (adaptation)
of the source code
will amount to reproduction of the adaptation (as distinguished from an
adaptation of the adaptation) the making
of which if unauthorised will infringe
the exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in the source code.
While the Committee still regards this analysis as correct, it notes that the
suggested additions to the definition of reproduction
will clarify the
protection of computer programs in either source or object code.
THE RIGHT TO PUBLISH A COMPUTER PROGRAM
9.58 Like the reproduction right, the right of authors to control the
publication of their works, ie, supply of reproductions of their
works to the
public (s.31(1)(a)(ii) of the Act) is essential for the commercial exploitation
of their works. In this regard the Committee
notes that the meaning of
‘publish’ was considered by the High Court in
Avel Pty Ltd
Multicoin Amusements Pty Ltd
[1990] HCA 58
(1990) 171 CLR 88
18 IPR 443.
case the court held that the right to publish should be read as meaning a right
to make public that which has not been previously
made public in a copyright
territory. The Committee is of the view that the copyright subsisting in
computer programs should continue
to include a publication right. Accordingly,
the Committee recommends that the owner of copyright in a computer program
should have
the exclusive right to publish the program (Recommendation
9.59 In so recommending, the Committee draws attention to a consequence for
computer programs of s.29(1)(a), insofar as it deems a
literary work to have
been published:
. . . if, but only if,
reproductions
of the work . . . have been
supplied . . . to the public (emphasis added).
The Committee understands that the most common or usual modes of supply to
the public of computer programs are in object code either
in the form of a
floppy disc or loaded directly onto the hard disc of a computer. As discussed in
paragraph 6.68, the object code
version of a computer program may not be a
reproduction, but rather an adaptation, of the source code version. A
consequence of this
is that supply of a program in the ways mentioned above
would, under s.29(1)(a), constitute publication of the object code, but not
the source code. In noting this, the Committee does not understand that this
would cause problems for program copyright owners,
who may indeed desire just
that result. If the Committee’s recommendation that a deeming provision
regarding reproduction of
computer programs is adopted this issue should not
arise (See paragraphs 6.63–6.85).
9.60 Microsoft Pty Limited suggested that the definition of publication
should include rental and lending and that the right of publication
extend beyond the right of first publication. It argued that this was necessary
because of the ready availability of technology
which enables the copying of
rented or loaned computer programs. The need for a separate right to enable
computer copyright owners
to control rental and lending of their programs is
discussed in paragraph 9.77 and following. The Australian Copyright Council
suggested, in response to the Draft Report, that a right of distribution
be created under the Act which would encompass the right
of publication. This
issue affects all copyright owners, not just the creators of computer programs,
and any decision regarding the
desirability of such a broad right needs to be
considered in this wider context. The Committee notes that this issue remains
discussion at the international level (WIPO Committee of Experts on the
Possible Protocol to the Berne Convention). For these reasons
the Committee
considers it would be premature for Australia to introduce such a right at this
stage, especially as it appears to
the Committee that at present the publication
right serves the needs of authors of computer programs adequately. Accordingly,
makes no recommendation on this issue other than that it be pursued in the
relevant international fora. The Committee does note,
however, that in its
recent Cultural Policy Statement,
Creative Nation
(18 October 1994), the
Government gave its in principle support to a “broad-based distribution
right” which, it noted,
was being refined by WIPO’s discussions. The
Government also indicated that this Committee would be given a new reference to
conduct a review of the Act to simplify it and would be asked specifically to
examine the implementation of a distribution right
for tangible copyright
THE RIGHT TO PERFORM A COMPUTER PROGRAM IN
9.61 What constitutes a “performance” under the Act is defined in
s.27(1)(a) as including:
. . . any mode of visual or aural presentation, whether the presentation is
by the operation of wireless telegraphy apparatus, by
the exhibition of a
cinematograph film, by the use of a record or by any other means . . . and a
reference . . . to performing a
work or an adaptation of a work has a
corresponding meaning.
The relevant exclusive right in works is, under s.31(1)(a)(iii), to perform
the work concerned “in public”. Public is
not defined in the Act,
but has been construed in a number of cases as involving the presence of persons
in other than domestic circumstances.
This has been most recently considered in
the decision of Gummow J of the Federal Court of Australia in
Commonwealth Bank of Australia
[1992] FCA 609
(1992) 40 FCR 59
25 IPR 157.
Computer Edge Pty Ltd
Apple Computer Inc and Anor
[1986] HCA 19
(1986) 161 CLR 171
the High Court observed that computer programs
are not literary in the sense that they are written to inform or entertain. As
already been noted more than once, computer programs, even in source code,
are intended not to entertain or inform humans but to
be acted on by machines
when rendered in machine code. On that basis the Committee thinks it most
unlikely that a source code program
would be performed in public in the same
ways that other literary works, such as stories and poems, or musical and
dramatic works,
are performed. About the only way in which the Committee can
conceive that a source code might be “performed” is if the
projected, eg, via an overhead slide, for viewing by participants in a seminar
(such a use would be a performance within
the meaning of s.27 of the Act).
9.63 The concept of a performance may have even less relevance in the running
of an object code program on a computer. The object
code which causes the
computer to function is invisible and imperceptible to the human senses. For
this reason, unlike source code
and traditional literary works, it cannot be
performed. However, representations of the object code could be generated and
on a computer screen. Those representations on a computer screen would
appear to be a performance of the program under s.27(1) (if
a substantial amount
is displayed). If the screen display was projected to persons other than in a
domestic situation, the Committee
understands that this would be a public
performance of the materials displayed. As an example of what is possible, at
the demonstration
to the Committee by IBM Australia Limited, referred to in
paragraph 3.02, the screen display of a computer program in assembler code
projected onto a large screen for all members to see.
9.64 To the extent that it is relevant, the performance right in works
should, in the Committee’s view, extend to computer programs
does to other literary works and other types of works such as musical and
dramatic works (Recommendation 2.11(c)).
9.65 The Committee received two comments on its recommendation in relation to
the performance right. The Australian Information Industry
Association Limited
(AIAA) endorsed the Committee’s position, while the Copyright Agency
Limited submitted that screen displays
should be considered to be a public
performance and noted that a screen display right may become more relevant to
multimedia material.
Given the insubstantial comments made on this issue the
Committee has decided not to amend its recommendation. Other comments received
by the Committee that pertain to public performance of material stored in
THE RIGHT TO BROADCAST A COMPUTER PROGRAM
9.66 The Committee did not receive any submissions regarding the broadcasting
of computer programs prior to the Draft Report, but
did receive a number of
submissions following its release. These are discussed below. In s.10(1) of the
Act “broadcasting”
is defined as meaning to “transmit by
wireless telegraphy to the public”. Wireless telegraphy is defined in
s.10(1) as:
the emitting or receiving, otherwise than over a path that is provided by a
material substance, of electromagnetic energy.
9.67 While literary, musical or dramatic works may be broadcast to inform or
entertain, if one has regard to the functional nature
of computer programs it
appears unlikely that they would be broadcast for those purposes. The Committee
acknowledges that in some
instances users may wish to transmit computer programs
from one location to another and in circumstances where the transmission could
not be received by persons other than the person to whom it was transmitted.
This can be done by wire (telephone), optical cable,
microwave or satellite
link. However, none of these acts is likely to be directed to the public such as
to attract the operation
of “broadcast” as defined. The control of
these activities by the copyright owner could be exercised through the
reproduction
9.68 As far as the Committee is aware there is no technology currently being
used commercially for the broadcasting and reception
of computer programs in
object code in Australia. However, the Committee is aware that digital
broadcasting is being developed in
the United States, Japan, the European Union
and elsewhere. While lacking in submissions on the matter, the Committee accepts
possibility that there might be some interest in being able to include
program code in, for example, educational broadcasts. Accordingly,
the Committee
recommends that the owners of copyright in computer programs should retain the
right to control the broadcast of their
programs (Recommendation 2.11(d)).
9.69 As mentioned above, the Committee received a number of submissions
following the release of the Draft Report. The submission
from APTV indicated a
number of present difficulties with the definition of “broadcast”.
In its submission, Oracle stated
that the definition of “broadcast”
would need to be flexible given new technology, and in a later submission (23
1994), submitted that an exclusive “transmission right” to
cover transmission of a work (or other subject matter) by
any means to any
person should be introduced. The ACC, in a similar vein, suggested that the
present “broadcast right”
and the “diffusion right”
should be replaced with a single right “to communicate the work to the
The ACC cited, in support of its argument, articles of the Berne
Convention which refer to this right (Articles 11(1)(i) and (ii)
(1)(ii)) and the model proposed by WIPO at the second meeting on the
Possible Protocol to the Berne Convention in 1992.
9.70 Since the Committee released its Draft Report and received these
submissions the Copyright Convergence Group (CCG) has given
consideration to the
specific issues arising for copyright as a result of new methods of
communication and has released its report,
Highways to
Change—Copyright in the New Communications Environment
1994). The CCG’s terms of reference required it to consider the position
of both “works” and “subject
matter other than works”
and the operation of the existing broadcast and diffusion rights. Its
recommendations in relation
to the “broadcast” right were as follows
(pp. 25–28):
(a) a new right to authorise transmissions to the public be introduced into
the Act which would cover the transmission of copyright
material in intangible
form to the public by any means or combination of means which is capable of
being made perceivable or used
by a receiving device
(b) the right to broadcast should be retained in the Act but as a sub-set of
the new transmission right and should be redefined to
complement the meaning of
broadcast as used in the
Broadcasting Services Act 1992
so that broadcast
could be defined as the transmission of television or radio programmes by any
means or combination of means whatsoever
to persons having the equipment
appropriate for receiving such transmissions. A “broadcast” would
not include a service
which provides no more than data or text, makes copyright
material available on demand on a point-to-point basis or is outside the
of broadcast in the
Broadcasting Services Act
. (However, these activities
would be included in the new transmission right).
9.71 Although the Committee has noted here briefly the recommendations of the
CCG, it has not had the opportunity to consider the
impact of the CCG’s
recommendations on computer programs or databases, given that the report of the
CCG was not released until
30 August 1994, ie, after the Committee had concluded
its deliberations on this issue. The Committee notes that in the
Government’s
recent Cultural Policy Statement (already referred to at
paragraph 9.60) the Government announced that it would implement the
recommendations
of the CCG to remove the anomalies identified in the Act.
THE RIGHT TO TRANSMIT A COMPUTER PROGRAM TO
SUBSCRIBERS TO A DIFFUSION SERVICE
9.72 Owners of copyright in literary and other works enjoy a right to control
transmission of their works by wire to the premises
of “subscribers to a
diffusion service”(s.31(1)(a)(v)). This is typically understood to refer
to transmission by subscription
cable radio or television services, although
under s.26 it could apparently include telephonic or telegraphic diffusion of
The Committee notes that, under s.31(1)(b)(iv), the diffusion right in
artistic works is more limited than for literary, musical
and dramatic
9.73 As already noted (paragraph 9.67), transmission of computer programs
from one location to another has been possible for some
time using the existing
telephone network. Similarly, other literary works may be transmitted over the
telephone network using facsimile
transmission machines. The Committee notes
that such uses would usually not come within the meaning of a diffusion service
of the Act because they are not provided to subscribers to a particular
service; rather they tend to be used by organisations and
individuals for their
own purposes or the distribution of the material would not be regarded as a
“service” as required
by s.26(1) (See
Australasian Performing
Right Association
Telstra Corporation Ltd
[1993] FCA 542
(1993) 27 IPR 357).
However, assuming the purpose of transmission is to provide the recipient with a
copy of the program transmitted, the copyright owner
can assert control by the
reproduction right, as was noted in paragraph 9.67.
9.74 However, the Committee is also aware that services, such as AARNET
connected to Internet, and AppleLink, are available which
have a wide and
growing public subscription. Such services may come within the meaning of
diffusion service in s.26 of the Act. Having
regard to this and the increasing
introduction of optical fibre and cable technology in Australia, the Committee
recommended in its
Draft Report that the owners of copyright in computer
programs should retain the right currently enjoyed to control the transmission
of their programs to subscribers to a diffusion service. The Committee sees no
reason to change this recommendation (Recommendations
9.75 Since the Committee considered this issue and made its recommendation,
the CCG has, as indicated above, specifically examined
both the broadcast and
diffusion rights and made recommendations in relation to each. The CCG
recommended that, as regards the existing
diffusion right (p.28, paragraph
(a) the right to transmit to subscribers to a diffusion service should be
removed from the Act and this right should be encompassed
within the new
transmission right (outlined in paragraph 9.71 above) and s.26 of the Act should
be repealed.
In making this recommendation the CCG noted that some activities which would
previously have been regarded as transmissions to subscribers
to a diffusion
service would now qualify as broadcasts or fall into the proposed transmission
right. The Committee notes that the
CCG’s report addressed the question of
what transmissions should be regarded as being “to the public” and
subject to that right, and has specifically adverted to diffusion via
in-house communications systems operated by businesses. The
CCG thought that
reliance could be placed on the reproduction right to control this type of use
of copyright materials which accords
with the Committee’s own view stated
a paragraphs 9.67 and 9.73. But bearing in mind the extensive scope of the right
of “public”
performance as interpreted in
Australasian Performing
Right Association v
Commonwealth Bank of Australia
[1992] FCA 609
(1992) 25 IPR 157
the Committee suggests that careful consideration will have to be given to
determining the application of the proposed new transmission
right to situations
such as in-house communications networks.
9.76 As mentioned at paragraph 9.71, the Committee has not fully considered
the CCG’s recommendations in any detail. However,
the submissions made to
the Committee in relation to this right indirectly queried its usefulness, given
its technological limitations
and hence its limited application. The content of
these submissions have already been referred to at paragraph 9.69 in relation to
the broadcast right, but the concerns raised in relation to the scope of the
broadcast right apply generally to the diffusion right
as well. Having regard to
the submissions made to the Committee and the CCG’s recent inquiry, the
Committee supports in principle
the CCG’s recommendation outlined above,
if those acts encompassed by the present diffusion right would become subject to
broadcast/transmission right.
A RIGHT TO CONTROL RENTAL OF COMPUTER
Submissions
9.77 The need for a rental right was raised in submissions to the Committee
prior to the Draft Report from the Australian Copyright
Council (ACC), the
Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA), the Australian Software
Distributors Association Inc (ASDA),
Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd, Curtin
University of Technology (WA) (Mr John Newman), Dataflow Computer Services Pty
Ltd, Gilbert and
Tobin Solicitors, ICL Australia Pty Limited, Lotus Development
Pty Limited, Microsoft Pty Limited, Mindscape International Pty Limited
Micronics Pty Ltd. Following the Draft Report a further seven submissions were
received, six of which supported the Committee’
recommendation to
introduce a rental right (Oracle, US Government, CBEMA, ACC, AIAA and
Hydrographic Service, Royal Australian Navy).
9.78 The main reason put forward for giving copyright owners a right to
control rental was that it was necessary if copyright owners
were to have any
chance of acting effectively against the unauthorised copying of their computer
programs. In their submission, Gilbert
and Tobin Solicitors noted that it was
unlikely that a computer program would be rented to perform a specific task.
They were usually
required on an ongoing basis to perform a continuing task.
Obvious examples of this are word processing and spread sheet programs
required by businesses on a day-to-day basis, not on a one-off basis. So rental
for use of the rented copy would appear
to be far less likely than rental for
making an own-use copy. Nevertheless, there may be some circumstances in which
the rental of
a program may be more desirable than its purchase—computer
games are one example.
9.79 The Committee also received two submissions prior to the Draft Report
and one in response to the Draft Report, from Mr Michael
Barnes, which did not
support the introduction of a rental right. In its submission, the LCA commented
that it was not persuaded
that there was a demonstrated need to include a rental
right among the exclusive rights of the owner of copyright in computer programs.
It observed that this was not the only form of subject matter that may form the
subject of a profitable rental business. The LCA
concluded that at this stage
neither the need for, nor the consequences of, a rental right had been
established. In its submission
the Department of State Services (WA) (WADSS)
noted that a rental right in itself would not prevent illegal copying. It urged
if a rental right were introduced, it should not apply to rental for study
or research purposes and that “rental” for
non-profit purposes, ie,
loans by libraries and educational institutions, should be allowed. The
Committee notes that this use of
“public lending” and is discussed later from paragraph 9.86.
The GATT TRIPS Agreement
9.80 As mentioned in paragraph 9.02, the finalisation of the Uruguay Round of
the GATT means that Australia must now grant authors
a rental right in respect
of computer programs. Article 11 of TRIPS provides, in relation to computer
In respect of at least computer programs . . . a member shall provide authors
and their successors in title the right to authorise
or to prohibit the
commercial rental to the public of originals or copies of their copyright works
. . . In respect of computer programs,
this obligation does not apply to rentals
where the program itself is not the essential object of the rental.
Implementation of TRIPS
9.81 The Committee notes that the Government has moved to introduce
legislation that will enable Australia to meet its international
obligations as
a result of TRIPS. The
was introduced into Parliament on 21 September 1994 and was debated in October
1994. This Bill proposes, among other things, amendments
to the Act to introduce
a rental right for copyright owners of computer programs. The Explanatory
Memorandum to the Bill explains
the scope of the new right being introduced
The new rental rights will apply only to a commercial rental arrangements
(sic). Public lending and other non-commercial lending arrangements
explicitly excluded. Also excluded from the right is rental of computer programs
where the rental of the program is not the essential
object of the rental. This
includes where it is not possible to copy the program in the normal use of the
rented object provided
the object is something other than a mere carrier, such
as a CD or circuit chip.
Page 5 of the Explanatory Memorandum further states:
. . . the copyright owner does not have the right to control rental of a copy
of a computer program embodied in a machine or device
if the program is not able
to be copied in the course of the ordinary use of the machine or device. This
would mean, for instance,
that the copyright owner could not control the rental
of a motor vehicle where a computer program is embodied in its engine control
Blank disc levy
9.82 The Committee notes that the main reason, or one of the main reasons,
why copyright owners of works and other subject matter
have been seeking a right
to control the rental of their works and other materials is to prevent
unauthorised copying. This was also
recognised by the European Commission in its
Explanatory Memorandum for its draft directive on rental and lending rights.
from rental, and the capacity to prohibit it outright are two ways of
enabling copyright owners to take action against loss of sales
unauthorised copying.
9.83 It has been argued that copyright owners could be compensated for this
copying by the introduction of a levy on blank recording
or storage media and
hardware. However, the Committee is of the view that computer programs are
different from, for example, musical
works and sound recordings for which a
blank tape royalty was introduced in Part VC of the Act. (The Committee notes
that this scheme
was held to be invalid by the High Court in
Australian Blank
Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd
Commonwealth of Australia
[1993] HCA 10
Like sound recordings computer programs vary enormously in their
production costs but, unlike sound recordings, their market price
also varies in
a manner which reflects, not so much the development or production cost, but the
function or purpose of the program.
It is the functional nature of computer
programs which distinguishes them from other copyright works and subject matter
such as books
and CDs whose function is to inform or entertain. While some
computer programs are the main component of computer games and, as such,
bought to entertain, a large portion of the market is for business computer
programs and programs with industrial applications.
The price of these reflects
the nature of the task they perform. The result is, not surprisingly, a huge
range in prices. For this
reason it would be difficult, if not impossible, to
set a blanket royalty rate on blank storage media that would adequately and
compensate all computer program copyright owners. Even if it were
possible, the range of prices of programs, as disclosed for example
interim report of the PSA on computer software prices (October 1992), would be
likely to argue in favour of a level of royalty
that was so high in relation to
the price of discs that it would be unacceptable to buyers and resisted by disc
manufacturers and
Recommendation
9.84 In the Draft Report the Committee said (paragraph 9.73):
The Committee accepts the view that uncontrolled rental of computer programs
is likely to lead to an increase in unauthorised copying.
For this reason
their computer programs. Accordingly,
the Committee recommends the introduction
of a rental right for computer programs. That right should be subject to the
that it does not extend to copies of computer programs incorporated
in utilitarian articles or other articles in which the computer
embodied and cannot be copied during the ordinary operation or use of that
article. In making this recommendation the
Committee is conscious that this
would be the first extension of the copyright owner’s right in Australia
to the control of
rental. The Committee is of the view that the particular
circumstances of rental of computer programs are such that this recommendation
should not automatically carry over to other categories of copyright works or
subject matter and that the case for a similar right
in respect of those other
works or subject matter would have to be separately made out.
9.85 The Committee reaffirms this recommendation noting that it has now been
fully endorsed by the TRIPS Agreement and that a rental
right will be introduced
not only for authors of computer programs but also for producers of phonograms
(articles 11 and 14(4) TRIPS)
(Recommendation 2.12).
A RIGHT TO CONTROL PUBLIC LENDING OF COMPUTER
9.86 Like rental, lending of works and other subject matter is not, under the
Act, among the exclusive rights of owners of copyright
in those materials.
However, the need to clarify the law in respect of the lending of computer
programs was raised by the Australian
Vice-Chancellors’ Committee (AVCC).
The AVCC submitted that university libraries, in particular, needed clear
guidelines on
the lending of computer programs to staff and students (including
external students).
International position
European Union
9.87 The EC Directive on
Rental and lending rights and on certain rights
relating to copyright
provides that Member States shall afford authors a
right to authorise or prohibit the lending of originals and copies of copyright
works and other subject matter (art.1). Article 1(3) of the Directive defines
lending as:
making available for use, for a limited period of time and not for direct or
indirect economic or commercial advantage, when it is
made through
establishments which are accessible to the public.
Article 2(1) of the Directive provides that (in the case of works) the right
to authorise or prohibit lending shall belong to the
author in respect of the
original or copies of his or her work.
9.88 Under the heading, “Rental of computer programs”, art.3 of
the Directive provides in effect that the Directive as
a whole is intended to be
without prejudice to art.4(c) of the EC Directive on Computer Programs (Appendix
G). While art.4(c) deals
with rental of computer programs, the Committee also
notes that the preamble to the Directive on Computer Programs includes the
“Rental” means the making available for use, for a limited period
of time and for profit-making purposes, of a computer
program or a copy
thereof;. . . this term does not include public lending, which, accordingly,
remains outside the scope of this
Accordingly, the EC Directive on Rental
alone appears to apply to the
lending of computer programs.
9.89 Article 5(1) of the Directive allows Members States to:
derogate from the exclusive right provided for in Article 1 in respect of
public lending provided that at least authors obtain remuneration
lending and to exempt certain categories of establishments from the payment of
such remuneration.
Possible Protocol to the Berne Convention
9.90 The Committee also notes that the provisional documents,
Concerning a Possible Protocol to the Berne Convention,
dated 29 April 1994,
prepared by the International Bureau of WIPO notes that there is little support
for the inclusion of a public
lending right in the Possible Protocol to the
Berne Convention. Accordingly, the proposal for a public lending right has been
from the Berne Protocol agenda and will not be discussed at the
forthcoming Committee of Experts meeting on the Berne Protocol in
December 1994.
Submissions
9.91 As noted in the Draft Report, the need for a public lending right was
not discussed in any detail in submissions to the Committee
and so the Committee
invited further submissions on the need for, and the scope of, (or any
exceptions to) a public lending right
for computer programs (paragraphs
9.78–9.79). Five submissions were received following the Draft Report. The
submissions were
divided in the views expressed about a public lending right.
The Australian Council of Libraries and Information Services (ACLIS)
CBEMA both agreed with the Committee’s recommendation in the Draft Report
not to introduce a public lending right.
On the other hand the AIAA and Oracle
did not agree with the recommendation. It should be noted that none of the
submissions provided
any substantial reasons for the views expressed. Mr Barnes
who was proposing to establish a club or society-run lending scheme was
opposed to the introduction of a public lending right and/or a rental right. The
Committee notes that if such a club or society
was not operated for profit, then
it would be unlikely to affected by the introduction of a rental right and if
the Committee’s
recommendation on public lending is accepted then such
clubs would similarly not be affected.
Recommendation
9.92 The Committee has considered these submissions and has decided to
confirm its draft recommendation. As the Committee stated in
the Draft Report,
the rationale for the introduction of a lending right in respect of computer
programs is similar to that for a
rental right. However, the Committee notes
that, unlike rental, there is no obligation under TRIPS for a public lending
be introduced and that internationally there is little support for such
a right. In the Draft Report the Committee also referred
to the public benefit
in allowing lending by educational institutions and institutions assisting the
handicapped, which it could
be argued outweighs the interests of copyright
owners. Although the Committee acknowledges that the potential exists for
owners to suffer some detriment as the result of the public lending of
computer programs, it is not persuaded by the submissions
it received that such
a right should be introduced at this time. In other words, the owner of
not have the exclusive right to authorise
or prohibit the public lending of his or her computer program (Recommendation
2.13). However,
the Committee considers that this issue could be reviewed at a
future date as part of the Committee’s inquiry into simplification
MORAL RIGHTS
9.93 The moral rights of authors are set out in art.6
of the Berne
Convention. It provides:
(1) Independently of the author’s economic rights, and even after the
transfer of the said rights, the author shall have the
right to claim authorship
of the work and to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification
of, or other derogatory action
in relation to, the said work, which would be
prejudicial to his honour or reputation.
(2) The rights granted to the author in accordance with the preceding
paragraph shall, after his death, be maintained, at least until
the expiry of
the economic rights, and shall be exercisable by the persons or institutions
authorised by the legislation of the country
where protection is claimed.
However, those countries whose legislation, at the moment of their ratification
of or accession to this
Act, does not provide for the protection after the death
of the author of all the rights set out in the preceding paragraph may provide
that some of these rights may, after his death, cease to be maintained.
(3) The means of redress for safeguarding the rights granted by this Article
shall be governed by the legislation of the country where
protection is
9.94 Part IX of the Act which deals with false attribution of authorship can
be considered as implementing some of the obligations
under art.6
Other provisions in the Act supporting attribution of authorship of works are
enforceable by the copyright owner rather than the
author as such. To the extent
that the Act does not provide comprehensively for the rights established by
, it is in line with what the WIPO
Guide to the Berne
or the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
Geneva, 1978) refers to as (p.44):
. . . the practice of member countries with an Anglo–Saxon legal
tradition, according to which the protection of the moral right
is mainly a
matter for the common law, and, in particular, the law of defamation.
9.95 The Committee is of the view that the authors of computer programs are
not in a different position to that of authors of other
particular, programs that have been produced by large teams of what would be
regarded as joint authors are not
essentially different to works comprising
substantial compilations, such as encyclopedias, directories and like
publications. In
those cases, the problem of dealing with a large number of
joint authors for the purposes of attributing authorship or securing consent
alteration of the work would be the same, so it seems to the Committee. While
the Committee has elsewhere in this report stressed
the functional nature of
programs, the Committee believes that some traditional literary works, such as
information directories,
timetables and the like are not greatly distinguishable
from computer programs in that regard. Accordingly, the Committee is of the
that the authors of computer programs should not be in a worse position than
authors of other literary works.
9.96 There were only five submissions following the Draft Report that
commented on the issue of moral rights and none of these was
particularly
critical of the Committee’s recommendation. Of the submitters, the CBEMA
and Oracle, while not vehemently opposed
to moral rights, did not see the need
for specific moral rights legislation for computer programs. Oracle’s 1994
did however appear to take a contrary position by raising concerns
submitted that it was not necessarily inappropriate that moral rights apply to
authors of computer programs.
Discussion Paper: Proposed Moral Rights Legislation
for Copyright Creators
9.97 The Committee notes that since the release of the Draft Report, the
Government has released a Discussion Paper on
Proposed Moral Rights
Legislation for Copyright Creators
(June 1994). Comment on the proposed
scheme was invited by 1 September 1994. The Introduction to the Discussion Paper
outlines the
history of the moral rights debate in Australia and the relevant
reports and inquiries in relation to this issue, including the Committee’s
Report on Moral Rights
. The introduction provides a summary of the
proposed scheme which is reproduced here (p.3):
In summary, the proposed scheme would involve an amendment to the Copyright
Act to accord relevant copyright creators the right of
attribution and the right
of integrity.
The right of attribution would involve the positive right to be made known to
the public as the creator of the work where reasonable
in all the circumstances,
the right to prevent others from wrongfully claiming authorship of a work and
the right to prevent others
from wrongfully attributing works to a creator.
The right of integrity would include the right to object to any material
alteration, distortion or other derogatory treatment of a
work. The right would
be limited by requiring that the action taken prejudicially affect the
author’s honour or reputation.
The legislation would provide that these rights apply to all works of
creators where reasonable in all the circumstances rather than
specific exceptions. The legislation would list a series of factors that would
be used as modifiers or guidelines for creators,
industries and organisations
that use copyright materials, and for the courts to follow in determining
whether the rights are applicable
in the circumstances. The intention is for the
legislation to strike a workable balance between the rights of copyright
the rights of users and producers of copyright material and the
community generally.
9.98 The proposed scheme is discussed in more detail in Part 3 of the
Discussion Paper. The proposed rights for authors, which the
understands are not intended to apply to authors of computer programs, are those
of attribution and integrity. The factors
to be taken into account to determine
whether exercising either of these rights is reasonable in all the circumstances
as follows (paragraphs 3.26 and 3.50):
(a) the nature of the work;
(b) the purpose or character of the use of the work;
(c) the context in which the work appears;
(d) any industry practice relevant to the work or the use of the work;
(e) any difficulty or expense to be incurred as a result of identifying the
(f) whether the work has been created in the course of employment; and
(g) whether the work of the author is identifiable or is part of a collective
9.99 As mentioned above, the Committee presented a
Report on Moral Rights
to the Government which was published in January 1988. In that report a
majority of the Committee expressed the view that it was inappropriate
introduce legislation to protect moral rights at that time. While the Committee
remains of the view that there is no need for
the enactment of specific new
legislation for the protection of the moral rights of the authors of computer
programs, it endorses
the approach proposed in the Discussion Paper as a general
test to determine whether exercising a moral right is reasonable in any
particular case (Recommendation 2.14).
Exceptions to Exclusive Rights
(the Act) provides for a number of
exceptions to the exclusive rights of copyright owners. These exceptions fall
into three broad
categories:
Nature of the use
: special characteristics of the use of the work
may render it in the public interest to allow such treatment. Current examples
the fair dealing provisions in ss.40–43 of the Act;
Nature of the user
: users who fall in to a particular class may be
given rights beyond those of other users. Examples of such users include Crown
educational
institutions, institutions assisting the handicapped and the Crown.
Copying of computer programs by the Crown under s.183 of the
Act is an area of
particular concern to producers of computer programs; and
Nature of the subject matter
: some subject matter which, although
aspects of it may come within the scope of copyright protection, is excluded
from copyright
protection because of its otherwise distinctive nature. Examples
include industrial designs and circuit layouts. Because of their
features care must be taken to ensure that any potential overlap between these
independently protected categories of subject
matter does not have unintended
Circuit Layouts Act 1989
(CL Act) is an
example of one such overlap with the Act.
The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Berne
Convention)
specifies in articles 9(2), 10 and 10
a number of
circumstances in which limitations are imposed upon the author’s exclusive
right to exploit his or her work in
recognition of the competing public need for
information. The provisions of the Act referred to at (A)
effect, allow free use of a copyright work by way of a fair dealing for research
or study, criticism or review, reporting
the news and judicial proceedings or
professional advice. Unlike dealings in category (A), those identified in
category (B) are permitted
under statutory licences which ensure that the
10.02 The breadth of the considerations with respect to educational use of
computer programs is such that a separate chapter has been
necessary to discuss
these matters (Chapter 12), but the remaining exceptions identified in (A) to
(C) are discussed in this chapter.
A. NATURE OF THE USE
INTRODUCTION
10.03 What is normally important to the purchaser or licensee of a computer
program is the right to use, ie, to execute or run the
program. The most common
form of commercial exploitation of copyright in a computer program is for the
or install a copy of the object code (a program which
can be loaded into a computer and run directly) and to grant a license to use
execute that program. The terms for use of the program are usually specified in
an agreement between the purchaser and the computer
program manufacturer or may
be implied. Where source code is distributed there are invariably complex
licensing arrangements.
10.04 Several submissions to the Committee contained assertions to the effect
that computer programs are often or mostly “licensed”
rather than
sold. When a copy of a copyright work published by or with the consent of the
the copyright passes with the copy. In
other words, what the purchaser of a book pursuant to a normal retail
transaction acquires
is ownership of the physical medium comprising a copy of
the work, but not of any copyright subsisting in the work. Thus the purchaser,
although owning the book, is not free to reproduce, perform or broadcast the
work, because these are the exclusive rights comprised
in the copyright, which
he or she has not acquired. To underline this analysis, the Committee notes that
the Act raises a contrary
presumption in the particular case of the disposition
by will of the manuscript of an unpublished work. Section 198 provides that
disposition is presumed to convey the copyright in the work unless there is a
contrary intention in the will.
10.05 Applying this analysis to computer programs as literary works, the
Committee does not believe that the owners of copyright in
published programs
intend, any more than owners of copyright in books, to part with their copyright
in selling or arranging to sell
copies of their programs. The distinction that
can be drawn between traditional literary works, such as books, and computer
is the nature of their use. Whereas books are purchased to be read, and
reading to oneself (or one’s family or friends) does
not involve the
exercise of any exclusive right, computer programs are bought to be used and use
necessitates reproduction which
is an exercise of an exclusive right of the
the normal use of the program. Thus in all circumstances in which copyright
is not conveyed to the purchaser of a copy of a program
and copying is required
for the normal use, the marketing of copies for normal use by the purchaser
necessarily involves “licensing”,
although such a licence might be
implied in the very act of marketing the program in the knowledge that its
normal use necessitates
copying. The licensing of computer programs seeks to
control that use typically by specifying the circumstances in which a computer
program can be reproduced for use by the purchaser (licensee).
The Committee also understands that copyright owners often seek
to impose restrictions on the use of copies of their programs over
and above the
restrictions flowing from their exclusive rights as owners of copyright in the
programs, and that they seek to do so
through the establishment of an effective
contract between the owner and the purchaser of the copy of the program binding
to observe those restrictions. For instance, as rental of copies of
owners, the
only way in which a copyright owner may restrain that use will be if there is a
contractual provision that empowers him
or her to do so. The Committee
understands that some copyright owners seek to impose restrictions of this
nature by so-called “shrink-wrap
licences”, viz, documents that are
enclosed in transparent wrapping around discs containing programs, and which
contain advice,
visible to the purchaser through the wrapping, that if he or she
opens the wrapping he or she thereby agrees to be bound by the additional
restrictions contained in the document. The Committee offers no comment on the
efficacy of the “shrink-wrap licence”
as a binding contract; this
depends on the application of the law of contract in each case. The purpose in
setting out the foregoing
analysis is to express the Committee’s concern
to distinguish between the licensing of a purchaser of a copy of a program to
copy it in the course of normal use, and restraining the purchaser from dealing
with the copy in ways that do not involve the copyright
owner’s exclusive
rights, eg, lending.
COPYING FOR NORMAL USE
10.07 As noted above, because most computer programs operate by reproduction
in whole or in part in the random access memory (RAM)
of the computer, each time
the purchaser of a copy of a computer program uses the program he or she
arguably exercises the copyright
owner’s right to reproduce the program in
material form. Unless the user has the permission of the copyright owner, this
constitute an infringement of copyright and, although permission may be
implied by the very act of marketing the program, the lack
of express statutory
sanction has been commented on.
10.08 Prior to the Draft Report the Australian Vice-Chancellors’
Committee and Australian Committee of Directors and Principals
(AVCC–ACDP) submitted
that the Act is silent about this and
other operations which may be necessary for the effective use of a program by
the purchaser.
The AVCC–ACDP commented that use of the program may require
(1990, pp. 1–2):
(a) copying the program into memory in order to execute it;
(b) copying the program onto a different floppy disk in order to use it on a
machine the floppy disk drives of which are incompatible
with the floppy disk on
which the software was supplied;
(c) copying the program onto a hard disk to permit efficient and convenient
(d) copying the program onto a different floppy disk or onto a hard disk to
enable it to be used in conjunction with other programs
supplied by a different
packages, grammar checkers, spreadsheets
etc. in conjunction with a word
(e) copying an application program (eg, a word processor) onto a new disk to
enable it to be used in conjunction with a later release
of operating system
software. The original operating system software may not support subsequent
upgrades to the computer or to other
(f) allowing a copy of a program resident on hard disk to be copied to
archival media (tapes or floppy disks etc.) as part of normal
system back-up
procedures. In a time-sharing or network environment, it is virtually universal
that the entire contents of all hard
disks, including copyright software, are
copied to a series of back-up tapes on a regular basis (daily or weekly). The
back-up tapes
are kept for the purpose of quickly restoring system operation in
the event of a disk failure.
10.09 The Committee has given careful consideration to the various examples
of uses mentioned in the AVCC–ACDP submission. In
the Draft Report
the Committee also noted that copyright owners often produce programs for
different computer formats in recognition of the potential
extent of use and
number of uses possible with a particular configuration. As the disc
configuration (allowing faster or wider access)
and the operating system program
(allowing network or increased multi-user access) can have some impact on these
factors, the Committee
approaches paragraphs (b) and (e) with caution but the
remaining examples are considered by the Committee to represent normal uses
the sense that they are uses a copyright owner or licensor would ordinarily
expect to be made of his or her computer program.
10.10 In the Draft Report the Committee expressed the view that (excluding
examples (b) and (e) outlined above) such reproductions
of computer programs
should not constitute infringements of copyright when undertaken with a
legitimate copy, ie, one made with the
licence of the copyright owner. In other
words, copying of a computer program that is incidental to its normal use should
not require
the licence, express or implied, of the copyright owner.
Accordingly, the Committee recommended that the Act be amended to expressly
provide that the copyright in a computer program is not infringed by a person
who copies that program where the making of that copy
is reasonable or necessary
for the normal use of a copy of the program made with the licence of the
draft recommendation was supported in
submissions from Alcatel Australia Limited (Alcatel) and the Law Council of
Australia (LCA).
10.11 In its submission commenting on the Draft Report De Data Pty Ltd (De
Data) suggested that the Committee should reconsider its
position regarding
paragraph (b). De Data commented that the Act should allow copying of a computer
program by either the supplier
or the consumer of a computer program from an
incompatible format where the required format is out of stock. However, the
is not persuaded that the non-availability of a computer program in a
particular format is sufficient reason in itself for derogating
from a copyright
owner’s right to control the reproduction of his or her property. There
may, in many cases, be sound commercial
reasons why a program is unavailable in
a particular format. Accordingly, the Committee reaffirms the comments made in
10.12 The Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA) and Computer
Sciences of Australia Pty Ltd (CSA) both commented that
the Committee’s
choice of the words “reasonable”, “necessary”, and the
term “normal use”
lacked certainty. Both suggested that the
Committee should clarify its intentions in respect of this recommendation. While
the Committee
acknowledges the desirability of certainty it notes that the word
“reasonable” is used in various provisions in the Act
and that its
use does not appear to have given rise to any particular difficulties. Also the
Committee does not favour defining what
is “necessary” nor the
meaning of “normal use” as this will depend upon the circumstances
in each case. Following
the Committee’s consideration of these
submissions, the Committee affirms its draft recommendation (Recommendation
BACK-UP COPYING
10.13 Section 43A of the Act as currently drafted allows the owner of a copy
of a computer program to make a back-up copy in certain
circumstances. The
section provides:
(1) Subject to subsection (2), the copyright in a literary work being a
computer program is not infringed by the making of a reproduction
of the work,
or of a computer program being an adaptation of the work, if:
(a) the reproduction is made by, or on behalf of, the owner of the copy (in
this section referred to as the “original copy”)
from which the
reproduction is made; and
(b) the reproduction is made for the purpose only of being used, by or on
behalf of the owner of the original copy, in lieu of the
original copy in the
event that the original copy is lost, destroyed or rendered unusable.
(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to the making of a reproduction of a
computer program, or of an adaptation of a computer program:
(a) from an infringing copy of the computer program; or
(b) contrary to an express direction by or on behalf of the owner of the
original copy not
later than the time when the owner of the original copy acquired the original
(3) For the purposes of this section:
(a) a reference to a copy of a computer program or of an adaptation of a
computer program is a reference to any article in which the
computer program or
adaptation is reproduced in a material form; and
(b) a reference to an express direction, in relation to a copy of a computer
program or of an adaptation of a computer program, includes
a reference to a
clearly legible direction printed on the copy or on a package in which the copy
is supplied.”
10.14 Submissions from the AIIA, Lotus Development Pty Ltd
Microsoft Pty Limited (Microsoft)
indicated that current industry
practice is to “license” most computer programs (discussed in
paragraphs 10.04–10.06).
Having regard to s.43A(2)(b) the purchaser of a
computer program who makes a back-up copy of the program will infringe copyright
if the licence forbids the making of back-up copies. Lotus submitted that
s.43A(1)(b) should be amended to enable a licensee to make
a back-up copy unless
expressly prohibited (because in many cases a copyright owner does not sell the
copy of the program to the
purchaser but merely licenses the copy). The
Committee accepts this proposal and accordingly recommends that s.43A(1)(b) be
to apply to licensees (Recommendation 2.16). Lotus also suggested that
s.43A(2)(b) should be amended so that it applies to the licensor
of a computer
program. However, the Committee understands that in most cases the licensor in
Australia will be the owner of copyright
in the program. If this is the case the
Committee queries the need to amend s.43A(2)(b) to apply to licensees.
10.15 It was also submitted that s.43A is at variance with the normal
practice of users of computer programs who make a back-up copy
to use and store
the original copy to protect it against damage. Therefore, it was suggested, the
section should be amended to allow
the back-up copy to be used instead of the
original. In the Draft Report the Committee recommended that the Act should
amended to allow a back-up copy to be used instead of the original
copy. It also recommended the Act
provide that where an original copy or
back-up copy is destroyed or damaged the surviving original, or back-up, as the
case may be,
may be used to make another back-up copy. There should be no
limitation on the number of times this can be done. The Committee also
acknowledged that this last mentioned recommendation may be opposed by some
effect, to a perpetual
copy. However, a majority of the Committee remains of the view that the
recommendation is essential having
regard to the particular characteristics of
computer programs. In this regard it noted the utilitarian nature of programs
in most cases they are required to perform their functions over a long
period of time. Secondly, their medium of storage is such
that they are easily
corrupted or destroyed. Accordingly the Committee affirms its prior
recommendations (Recommendations 2.17(a),
2.17(b) and 2.17(c)).
10.16 Also in the Draft Report the Committee recommended that a purchaser or
licensee of a copy of a computer program should only
be allowed to make a
back-up copy of the program subject to the positive negation of that right in
accordance with s. 43A(2)(b). This
comment was supported by the AIIA, the LCA
and the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association (CBEMA). The
Council of Libraries and Information Services (ACLIS) also supported
this recommendation. However, it noted that there might be an
increase in the
number of express prohibitions by software providers. Only Alcatel in its
submission indicated that it did not favour
the retention of s.43A(2)(b). The
Committee discussed this issue at its meetings in December 1993 and March 1994.
It agreed that
s.43A(2)(b) should be repealed. The Committee’s reason for
so recommending, notwithstanding the submissions it received supporting
earlier recommendation, is based on a policy consideration. As noted in
paragraph 10.15 computer programs are easily corrupted
and are utilitarian in
nature. These two factors mitigate in favour of purchasers having the
unqualified right to copy the program
for the limited purpose of making a
back-up. For this reason the Committee now recommends that s.43A(2)(b) be
deleted (Recommendation
2.18 ). The issue of contracting out is further
discussed at paragraph 10.106.
10.17 However, the Committee does accept the following limitation on the
right to make a back-up copy.
The right to make a back-up copy should not
extend to copies of computer programs that have been “locked” by the
owner against the making of copies (Recommendation 2.19). The locking
of computer programs is one way in which the copyright owner
can signal a desire
to prevent the making of copies for other than normal use.
EPHEMERAL BACK-UP COPYING BY BUSINESSES
10.18 There is one other form of back-up copying of computer programs which
the Committee believes deserves special mention, namely
ephemeral back-up
copying by businesses. The Committee understands that it is common practice for
many businesses to back up their
work each day. This usually means that
everything stored on the business’ computer, including data and programs,
is down loaded
onto another form of storage such as magnetic tape or floppy
disc. This copy is then stored in a safe place as a precaution against
unforeseen disasters such as fire, earthquake or even terrorist attack. Such
back-up copies are usually retained only for a limited
period as their
usefulness is short lived. Nonetheless, it is likely that businesses may keep
copies for a number of days before
reusing the tape or disc on which the
material is stored. Such back-up copying, insofar as it includes computer
programs together
with business data, ought not be an infringement of the
making of an ephemeral back-up copy of a computer program that is incidental to
the normal back-up copying of business data for security
purposes should not be
an infringement of copyright (Recommendation 2.20).
Third party maintainers
10.19 In a submission received from Bull HN Information Systems Australia Pty
Ltd (Bull HN) the Committee was asked to consider whether
the scope of the
back-up copy provision should be broadened to include the services provided by
third party maintainers. As the Committee
understands the proposal, persons who
service computer equipment are often required to replace integrated circuits
which contain
computer programs. This can be done by copying the program from an
identical integrated circuit and storing it on another. Bull HN
currently this activity is outside the scope of s.43A because the copy is not
made by the purchaser nor is it made from
the copy of the program owned by the
purchaser. The copy would be made for the purchaser by the third party
maintainer to replace
the defective copy.
10.20 The Committee has considered this proposal but it does not support
extension of s.43A as suggested by Bull HN. In the Committee’s
position of third party maintainers is quite different from that of purchasers
of computer programs. A purchaser is free
to choose whomever he or she wishes to
maintain his or her equipment. If the carrying out of maintenance work involves
an infringement
of copyright because part of what is being maintained needs to
be replaced the maintenance work may not be able to be carried out.
regard to the commercial nature of their operations a right such as that
suggested by Bull HN would amount to a licence to
freely copy computer programs
for the purpose of providing spare parts for computer hardware. The Committee
can see no justification
for providing what would be, in effect, a statutory
licence to copy programs for a commercial purpose. In the Committee’s
the copying of computer programs for such purposes should remain a
matter for negotiation between the copyright owner and the third
maintainer (Recommendation 2.21).
REVERSE ENGINEERING AND DECOMPILATION
Definitions
10.21 At the Committee’s public hearings held in Sydney in
July 1990 and in subsequent submissions to the Committee there were
number of different definitions put forward to explain the meaning of the terms
“reverse engineering”, “decompilation”
“disassembly”. For the sake of clarity, before commencing an
examination of the issues arising in this area, the
Committee has set out below
the definitions it
has adopted for each of those terms, as well as the
terms “porting”, “interoperability”, and
specifications” which are used in the succeeding
paragraphs. Following the release of the Draft Report the Committee received
submissions from Professor W R Cornish and the Supporters of Interoperable
Systems in Australia (SISA) regarding the Committee’s
definition of
interoperability. SISA suggested the definition of interoperability adopted by
the Committee should be replaced with
the following (p.11, paragraph 3.21):
Interoperability is the functional interaction between hardware, computer
programs, and users which gives the ability to exchange
information and to
mutually use the information which has been exchanged.
10.22 The Committee has reconsidered and revised its definition of
interoperability having regard to those comments it has also revised
definitions of decompilation and disassembly:
Decompilation
: the working back from the object code of a computer
program to a version of the source code. This process may involve a substantial
recreation or reproduction of the source code of the original program.
Decompilation is achieved using a computer program called
a decompiler.
Disassembly
: the working back from object code to assembler code ie, a
special case of decompilation. Disassembly is achieved using a computer
called a disassembler.
Interface specifications
the description of the logical and
physical interconnection and interaction which allows a hardware or computer
program product to
interact as intended with other hardware, computer program(s)
Interoperability
: the ability of computer systems to exchange
information and mutually to use the information which has been exchanged.
making the arrangements necessary so that a computer
program that runs on one computer is able to run on a differently configured
computer. This generally involves modification of the original program.
Reverse engineering
: the study or analysis of a computer product
(including a computer program) in order to reveal the underlying idea or
principle on
which it operates. This analysis may include an examination of
relevant published documentation, study of the operation of the product
the case of computer programs, their decompilation. Studying of the operation of
a program would involve reproduction of
the program in the same way as normal
use (see paragraphs 10.07–10.12).
Introduction
10.23 It has long been a practice in the area of engineered products that
techniques are developed to examine a product in order to
create a new product
which performs a similar function. Those techniques are known as “reverse
engineering”. In the area
of patented inventions, usually it will be the
product developed using this practice, rather than the act of reverse
engineering,
that may (or may not) infringe the patent. In most cases reverse
engineering would not usually involve the making of a copy of a
patented product
as to do so would infringe the patent. With traditional literary works, eg, a
book, an author may decide to write
a definitive work on a subject and, to do
so, the author may study (read) a number of books. Such reading will not
infringe copyright
(although if the author’s work is found to reproduce
substantial parts of the books read, the reading of those books will be
that the reader had an opportunity to copy; without more, however, it will not
establish copying).
10.24 Computer programs are rarely distributed in a form that lends itself to
the ready ascertainment of the underlying ideas and
principles upon which the
program is based. Most programs are published in object code which is not
perceivable by human senses.
Accordingly, to determine the underlying codes and
principles of the program for whatever purpose — either to create a
product, an interoperable product or simply to correct an error, some
form of reverse engineering of the object code version of the
program will be
necessary. As recognised by the Committee’s definition of reverse
engineering in paragraph 10.22, that process
may involve not only the study of
relevant published documentation and the operation of the program (which may
include measuring
the various electrical signals that are generated while it is
operating, including those signals which pass between the computer
on which it
is running and other computers or devices), but also, decompilation of the
object code. Studying the operation of the
program and decompilation will
involve its reproduction. The need to decompile the object code of a program in
the course of reverse
engineering will depend upon whether or not sufficient
information can be obtained to understand the underlying ideas and principle,
from a study of the operation of the program and any published
documentation.
10.25 The Committee understands that a major concern of the owners of
to be undertaken
in the course of reverse engineering provides an opportunity for competitors to
clone their programs with relative
ease (this is discussed in more detail in
paragraphs 10.38—10.39). Once decompiled the source code can be
manipulated relatively
easily to hide any visual similarity while retaining the
same functionality. In other words decompilation can be used in this way
competitors to free ride on the efforts of the original creator. The Committee
accepts this as a real concern. Accordingly, it
recommends that reverse
engineering including decompilation should be prohibited except for the limited
circumstances required for
interoperability and error correction discussed later
in this chapter (Recommendation 2.22).
10.26 The Committee also notes that reproducing a computer program in the
course of running it for the purpose of reverse engineering
may not be a
licensed “normal use”(it is also an activity that cannot in practise
be controlled by the copyright owner).
Reverse engineering of a program
that extends to decompiling it is also an activity that is
unlikely to be
licensed by the copyright owner. Further, construction of a version of a program
that approximates its source code
may, in the light of the
Autodesk Inc
Martin Dyason and others (
[1992] HCA 2
(1992) 173 CLR 330
) also amount to a reproduction of the source code.
Accordingly, unless
reverse engineering and limited decompilation come
within the fair dealing exception in the Act if it is to be sanctioned it will
have to be made an exception to the exclusive reproduction right of the
5(3) and 6 of
Directive on the Legal Protection of Computer Programs
Directive on Computer Programs)
(Appendix G).
FAIR DEALING UNDER THE ACT
10.27 In the draft report the Committee considered whether the fair dealing
exception to copyright infringement under s.40 of the
Act offered substantial
scope for what might be regarded as justifiable reverse engineering. Section
40(1) provides that:
A fair dealing with a literary. . . work, or with an adaptation of a . . .
work, for the purposes of research or study does not constitute
an infringement
of the copyright in the work.
Section 40(2) provides that:
. . . the matters to which regard shall be had, in determining whether a
dealing with a . . . work or with an adaptation . . . being
a dealing by way of
copying the whole or a part of the work or adaptation, constitutes a fair
dealing . . . for the purpose of research
or study include:
(a) the purpose and character of the dealing;
(b) the nature of the work or adaptation;
(c) the possibility of obtaining the work or adaptation within a reasonable
time at an ordinary commercial price;
(d) the effect of the dealing upon the potential market for, or value of, the
work or adaptation . . .
10.28 In the Draft Report the Committee referred to a case in the USA,
the Court of Appeals (9th Circuit) held that reverse engineering,
including the
decompilation of a program to determine its unprotected
ideas and functional concepts was permissible as a “fair use”
s.107 of the US
Sega Enterprises Ltd
[1993] USCA9 19
977 F. 2d 1510
(9th Cir. 1992) (
That decision, to which further reference will be made hereafter, has attracted
considerable attention. However, the Committee
attaches importance to the
decision as a guide to what might be done by way of amendment to Australian law
to address the matter
of reverse engineering, rather than as a guide to the
interpretation of “fair dealing” under s.40. While the Committee
understands that the list of matters in s.40(2) quoted in the last paragraph was
drawn from a comparable list to the one used
in s.107 of the US
there are differences. Notably, and relevantly
for present purposes, s.40(2)(c) has no counterpart in the US provision.
the requirement in s.40 that a fair dealing must be for the purposes of
“research or study” is narrower than the US provision
which has an
inclusive, not exhaustive, list of purposes for which “fair use”
will not be an infringement. Thus in two
very relevant respects, “fair
use” under the US Act appears to be different to and broader than
“fair dealing”
under s.40.
10.29 The requirement that a fair dealing under s.40 be for the purposes of
“research or study” has been considered by
Denis Rose QC, Chief
General Counsel of the Attorney-General’s Department. Although Mr
Rose’s opinion was sought in relation
to a different activity to that of
reverse engineering, his conclusion nevertheless seems to be applicable to the
latter. It is,
in Mr Rose’s view:
likely that the courts would hold that ‘study’ is confined to
study by individuals for their own purposes, whether in
private or in some
institutional course or otherwise. Moreover, the courts could well confine
‘research’ to research
activities such as those in universities and
the CSIRO, for the purpose of increasing knowledge in the community as a
contrast for instance, with research in a Government Department
for the purpose of advising Ministers on proposed legislation, or
research by a
manufacturing company for the purpose of improving its products.
Should the courts adopt such an interpretation it would limit considerably
the extent to which commercial computer program producers
could rely on s.40 in
defence of reverse engineering undertaken by them in the course of their
commercial developmental activities.
10.30 There is a second matter to be addressed in invoking s.40 to justify
reverse engineering, namely, s.40(2)(c), which as already
noted has no
counterpart in the US “fair use” provision and which was included as
part of the implementation of the Franki
report on photocopying (
the Copyright Law Committee on Reprographic Reproduction
, AGPS, Canberra,
1976). The Committee understands that a typical commercial research and
development operation is where a commercial
program producer reverse engineers a
successful and therefore readily available program of a competitor. A normal
reading of s.40(2)(c)
would weigh against a conclusion that all types of copying
in the course of reverse engineering including that done during
decompilation,
could be justified as a fair dealing. The Committee notes
that s.40(2)(c) would apply only to, say, making a copy in the course of
the program preparatory to decompiling it. Section 40(2)(c) would presumably
have no application to the version produced
as a result of decompilation, which
would clearly not be commercially available.
10.31 In the light of these considerations, the Committee doubts that s.40 is
a satisfactory existing means of marking out the extent
of permissible reverse
engineering.
REVERSE ENGINEERING: COMPATIBILITY WITH THE BERNE
10.32 Allowing decompilation in the course of reverse engineering was alleged
by IBM Australia Limited (IBM)
to be “problematic” in view of
the international ramifications of such a right being granted. In its submission
1990 IBM stated that sanctioning
decompilation as part of reverse
engineering would, among other things (p. 8):
• place Australian developers at an advantage relative to competing
developers in other countries where such an exception does
conflict with the provision under the Berne Convention,
Article 9(2), since allowing some copying and adaptation
of a copyright work for commercial purposes—frequently to obtain an
advantage over the copyright owner of the subject program—would
‘conflict with the normal exploitation of the work’
‘unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author’;
— Article 10, which permits the utilisation of literary works for
teaching provided such utilisation is ‘compatible with
In the Draft Report the Committee considered the applicability of the Berne
Convention to the decompilation of computer programs in
object code (see
Chapter 4 of the Draft Report), and there the Committee (with one exception)
concluded that the Berne Convention does not require
the protection of programs
in object code. However, the Committee also noted that a consequence of the
Autodesk case
decision may be that the decompiled version of a program in
object code may reproduce a substantial part of the source code program
notwithstanding that the person doing the decompilation has, self-evidently, not
seen the source code (see paragraph 5.25). For this
reason the Committee decided
to treat the Berne Convention as applying to decompilation to create an
approximation of the
source code. Since the Draft Report was completed
negotiations in the Uruguay Round of the GATT were concluded. When that
comes into force Australia will be bound under art.10 of the TRIPS
text to protect computer programs, whether in source or object
code, as literary
works under the Berne Convention. This will remove any uncertainty as to the
applicability of the Berne Convention
to computer programs.
10.33 The Committee notes that art.9(2) of the Berne Convention provides:
(2) It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to
permit the reproduction of such works in certain special
cases, provided that
such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and
does not unreasonably prejudice
the legitimate interests of the author.
The provision contains two conditions which apply cumulatively, ie, permitted
reproduction must satisfy both conditions to be compatible
with art.9(2). In
relation to the first condition, viz, “provided that such reproduction
does not conflict with a normal exploitation
of the work” the
the Berne Convention
or the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
(WIPO, Geneva, 1978) (WIPO Guide) states (p. 55, paragraph 9.7):
If the contemplated reproduction would be such as to conflict with the normal
exploitation of the work it is not permitted at all.
Novels, school books, etc.,
are normally exploited by being printed and sold to the public. This Article
does not permit member countries
to allow this eg., under compulsory licences,
even if payment is made to the copyright owners.
If the information gained from decompilation in the course of reverse
engineering
were used to make and market a similar program which amounted
to a copy and which failed to come within the permitted exception in
it would be the making of that copy, and not the reproduction for decompilation
undertaken in the course of reverse engineering
that would be the prohibited
10.34 If the first condition is met, so that the reproduction does not
conflict with the normal exploitation of the work, it is still
necessary to see
if there is unreasonable prejudice to the legitimate interests of the author. In
paragraph 9.8 of the WIPO Guide
the question of what is unreasonable
prejudice is examined in terms of lost sales. The making of a single copy of a
journal may result
in the loss of one sale but it is unlikely to unreasonably
prejudice the interests of the author. However, the making of many copies
limited edition publication and its subsequent distribution would. Again, in the
context of reverse engineering a computer program
by running it and observing
its behaviour to determine its underlying idea and
to enable the
independent creation of a similar program using that idea (or the development of
a program that will operate in conjunction
with the first), it is difficult to
see how reproduction for the purpose of these activities will unreasonably
prejudice the interests
of the author. On the other hand, a broadly expressed
right to reproduce for decompilation might not come within art.9(2) on the
that it facilitated unauthorised copying to such an extent as to conflict with
the normal sales of the work to the prejudice
of the interests of the owner of
10.35 IBM also asserted that allowing decompilation as part of the reverse
engineering process
would conflict with art.10 of the Berne Convention
or, more precisely, art.10(2)(use of works by way of illustration for teaching).
The Committee understands that in most cases decompilation is not used for
teaching purposes. Decompilation is used in the course
of reverse engineering by
competitors to make interoperable and competing products. The provisions of
art.10(2) do not appear to
be relevant in that context. The sanctioning
of decompilation in such cases
would fall to be considered under
art.9(2) already discussed.
10.36 Where a program is reverse engineered and decompiled for teaching
purposes, for example in a university course, the Committee
notes that the
article provides that such utilisation of the works must be “compatible
with fair practice”. In the WIPO
Guide at paragraph 10.4 the concept
of compatible with fair practice is discussed. According to the Guide (p.
It implies an objective appreciation of what is normally considered
admissible. The fairness or otherwise of what is done is ultimately
a matter for
the courts, who will no doubt consider such questions as the size of the extract
in proportion both to the work from
which it was taken and that in which it is
used, and, particularly the extent to which, if any, the new work, by competing
old, cuts in upon its sale and circulation, etc.
Having regard to these comments the Committee concludes that reverse
engineering including limited decompilation could be allowed
for teaching
purposes consistently with the provisions of art.10(2).
REASONS FOR REVERSE ENGINEERING
10.37 Reverse engineering of computer programs may be undertaken for a number
of reasons including the purposes of:
(a) creating clones (programs that look and perform like the program thus
(b) modification for interoperability and to determine interface
specifications;
(c) facilitating porting;
(d) facilitating error correction (debugging); and
(e) understanding techniques used in the program by its creators.
Creating clones
10.38 In its submission to the Committee, Lotus claimed that the main purpose
of reverse engineering is to create a clone of the original
program. IBM claimed
in its presentation to the Committee that computer programs are available which
decompile other programs very
rapidly making the task of cloning programs
relatively easy. IBM submitted that to allow decompilation as part of the
reverse engineering
would (July 1990, p.8):
benefit software copiers only—by providing an opportunity to create
successive adaptations of computer programs without liability
to the copyright
According to IBM
once a program is available in a high level language
(which is not limited to a particular machine), a competitor intent on cloning
the program can manipulate the code thus derived to hide any similarity to the
original program. IBM’s demonstration to the
Committee was held on 22
November 1990. At that presentation, only a simple form of decompilation was
demonstrated, namely the disassembly
of a relatively small program. No evidence
of generalised decompilation to high level computer languages was provided.
The Committee shares IBM’s concern that any new exception
to existing rights should not expand the opportunities for computer
copiers to create and market programs which are simply copies or adaptations of
the original program. However, it notes that
any new program that is produced by
reverse engineering an existing program and which is a copy or adaptation of the
latter program
is no less an infringement. Nevertheless, it accepts that any
such new exception to exclusive rights must be limited to particular
purposes. The Committee does not agree with IBM that only computer program
copiers will benefit from such a right. Submissions
from a number of interests,
including hardware vendors, indicated a need for such an exception for other
purposes, which have been
identified in paragraph 10.37 and which will be
examined in detail. The Committee also notes that the large number of ways and
number of steps that can be involved in the compilation of source code to
object code mean that it is highly unlikely that decompilation
will lead back to
a complete version of the original source code.
Rights in relation to modification
Interoperability and interface
specifications
10.40 The owner or user of a purchased computer program may wish to modify
that program to allow interoperability with:
(a) other programs on the same computer including those written by the user
(including modules added to extend the functionality of
the program);
(b) other hardware attached to the same computer;
(c) new operating system programs on the same computer;
(d) other computers accessed via a network;
10.41 There are two major ways in which programs can be made to interact with
each other and with hardware:
(a) existing programs can be modified to communicate directly with other
programs or newly acquired hardware; and
(b) additional programs may be written to provide a link between existing
programs or between an existing program and hardware.
There is no copyright basis for preventing creation of additional original
programs. Under the approach outlined in (b), the user
could either write the
linking program which provides the interoperability or obtain a linking program
from a third party. The creation
of programs capable of operating in conjunction
with existing programs and hardware is a common need of the vast majority of
of computer programs. Those who have the resources will wish to create
their own programs to allow existing hardware and computer
program products to
be used together and to pass information easily between multiple products.
Others will wish to purchase such
products written by third parties.
The process of writing a program to facilitate interoperability
involves examining the interfaces of existing products. Knowledge
of interfaces
to hardware may also be required. Often interface specifications will be
published or can be determined from observation
of the existing system in
operation. Sometimes an examination of the program with which the new program is
interoperating or of a
related program, is necessary to fully determine the
interface. Where a program is distributed as source code, this can simply be
examined. Where it is distributed in machine-readable form, some sort of reverse
engineering process may be necessary. That process
may include decompilation of
the object code. The Act does not currently prevent the independent creation of
new programs which interact
with an existing program and the Committee can see
no reason for changing this position. The only issue that remains is what
can be used to determine the interface specifications.
10.43 At present, modifying programs without licence would, in many cases,
constitute an infringement of copyright, as the process
of modification would
frequently include creating an unauthorised reproduction or adaptation of the
original program. Achieving interoperability
by modifying the existing program
would therefore require the user in such cases to negotiate a licence with the
to modify the program. Further exploitation of that adaptation,
or substantial reproduction,
such as making copies of, or publishing the
modified program would also be subject to the permission of the owner of
the original program.
10.44 In its submission to the Committee, Fujitsu Australia Ltd (Fujitsu)
stated that (p. 18):
The only way to make interoperable products is to determine the interfacing
rules that must be followed to allow product-to-product
communication or data
exchange. While many interface requirements are published, they usually are
described incompletely, inaccurately
or belatedly, necessitating the application
of other research techniques.
Fujitsu further submitted that reverse engineering for interoperability is
essentially reverse engineering to determine interface
specifications to
facilitate interoperability. This view is affirmed by submissions from SISA and
the EC Directive on Computer Programs.
10.45 Fujitsu identified two main situations where reverse engineering is
required. These were, first, in the development of interoperable
products, the
determination of interface specifications was said to be essential because the
. . . interfacing rules . . . must be followed to allow product-to-product
communication or data exchange
and second, where different programs are required to run on the same system.
In such cases it may be necessary to discover the interfaces
of each of the
programs, to each other and to the operating system, to determine (p. 17):
. . . how products from several vendors will best work together, with or
without additional software.
Both of these situations demonstrate that interoperability and interfaces are
inextricably linked.
10.46 Bull HN submitted that only in the most basic situations can reverse
engineering be effectively conducted by monitoring the
external behaviour of a
system. In most cases access to the code of the program is necessary. The
submission further described a
procedure used in the US and Japan, similar to
the “clean room” technique, to make interoperable products. The
program is decompiled and analysed by a team of programmers which
supplies details of those elements of the program necessary for
interoperability. A second team, without reference to the program thus analysed,
creates another program using only the information
supplied and its own
creativity. Having regard to this procedure, Bull HN submitted that reverse
engineering is not a short cut,
the analysis of the decompiled program is
time-consuming and this time must be added to the time taken to create the
compatible program.
10.47 The Committee notes that in the circumstances outlined by Bull HN, the
“reverse engineer” is seeking to create an
interoperable product
without copying the original program. One team of programmers determines the
underlying ideas of the program,
the other team uses that information to
independently create an interoperable program. Those programmers do not copy or
original program; they independently write an interoperable program.
However, where the process of
decompilation and disassembly of the
original program involves adaptation of that program, the general use of these
techniques is
at present prohibited without the licence of the copyright
10.48 In its submission made prior to the Draft Report
IBM rejected
the argument that determination of interfaces should be the basis for a reverse
engineering exception to facilitate and
thus to encourage interoperability. In
that submission IBM stated (July 1990, p. 9):
To a certain extent, the international software market has witnessed
significant industry initiatives to standardise interconnections
facilitate this, copyright owners have taken steps to make their
‘interface’ information available. Some of these
initiatives include:
Open Systems Interconnection (‘OSI’), a set of
standards for transaction processing, electronic data interchange, remote
Organisation for Standardisation, the ‘ISO’).
In telecommunications, recommendations by CCITT, a committee
of the International Telecommunications Union (‘ITU’), a
organisation, for interconnection to the Integrated Services Digital Network
Several industry organisations have been formed recently to
promote greater availability of information about interfaces, including
X–OPEN and the Open Software Foundation (‘OSF’), INIX
International and the Extended Industry Standard Architecture
(‘EISA’) consortium.
In the United States, primarily in response to consumer demand, software and
hardware suppliers are already voluntarily moving towards
open systems, and we
would argue, that without strong copyright protection, this trend which is
proceeding satisfactorily throughout
the world, is unlikely to have
publish, interfaces to encourage others to write applications
programs for their
systems. IBM, for example, has published 300–400 interfaces (described in
many volumes) specifically to
allow users to write programs to run with the IBM
System 370 operating system MVS/XA.
10.49 The Committee acknowledges the extensive work being done
internationally to encourage open systems and the publication of standard
interface specifications to promote interoperability between products from
different vendors. The Committee also notes that the product
which IBM cites as
an example of the extensive publication of interfaces is an operating system and
an operating system is rarely
marketable unless a number of manufacturers are
creating programs for it, hence the need to extensively publish the interfaces.
products are rarely as extensively documented, and the Committee is not
convinced that the makers would always be willing to make
the information
available if users had to rely on them, ie, if decompilation was not permitted
for the purpose. The Committee also
notes that reverse engineering is usually a
time-consuming and costly exercise and if reliable interface specifications were
users would be less likely to go to the trouble of decompiling the
product in question. If users had a right to decompile a product
and vendors
wished to discourage users from doing so, they would be likely to publish
detailed and accurate interface specifications.
Therefore, the Committee
contends that the move towards open systems will be promoted rather than
retarded by allowing users to decompile
products to determine the interfaces,
particularly if this right is confined to situations where the information is
otherwise not
available. In the draft report the Committee recommended that the
decompilation of computer programs for the limited purposes of
interoperability with other computer programs should not constitute an
infringement of copyright where the information
necessary to achieve this is
otherwise not available.
For interoperability with other programs
10.50 The Committee received nine submissions commenting on its draft
recommendation regarding decompilation for interoperability.
The AIIA advised
the Committee that as there was no consensus within its membership it was unable
to offer a specific recommendation
on this issue. The submissions from IBM, the
CBEMA and CSC/CSA made the following points, which the Committee notes largely
comments received prior to the Draft Report:
• an exception for decompilation was not supported by any legitimate
need in the market place;
• a consequence of the introduction of a decompilation right will be an
increased risk of piracy;
• the decompilation provisions were unjustified given customer demand
for interoperable systems, new standards and the increasing
move to “open
• the relevant information is usually available free or subject to a
licence; and
• the “fair dealing” provisions of the Act should apply in
these circumstances (this point was also supported by
Mr Muratore).
However, IBM also submitted that if the Committee remained inclined towards
recommending an exception for decompilation it should
recommend that any
Australian legislation follow the precise wording of the EC Directive on
Computer Programs.
10.51 The Committee received a submission from the American Committee for
Interoperable Systems (ACIS) whose members support the introduction
of a limited
right to allow decompilation for interoperability. ACIS submitted that:
• market forces alone would not solve the “imperative of
interoperability”;
• decompilation is a technical necessity to an adequate understanding
of the ideas and principles embodied in a computer program;
• decompilation is not a tool for pirates. At most it reveals a
“distant shadow” of the high level source code in
which the program
was written.
The ACIS submission also noted that the industry is divided on this
10.52 In his submission Mr Muratore observed that allowing decompilation for
interoperability has consequences for the scope of copyright
protection in the
original program. In the case of applications programs he noted there are at
least two possibilities. One is that
small parts of the original program may
have to be embodied in the other to make it functional. The other is that the
interoperable
program may operate only if it can be attached
“Siamese-like” to the original. In both cases he noted that there
a derogation of the original program owner’s rights. The Committee is
divided on the question of whether allowing decompilation
in such circumstances
derogates from the copyright owner’s rights. However, the Committee is of
the view that the public interest
is better served by allowing the developers of
interoperable products to develop interoperable products in this way. It also
that the development and marketing of an interoperable program that
attaches “Siamese-like” to another would likely advantage
of copyright in the original program.
10.53 Alcatel, SISA, and the LCA all supported the Committee’s draft
recommendation. The LCA commented that the exception should
not be limited to
decompilation as defined by the Committee. It proposed that it should extend to
(p. 4, paragraph 4.7):
reproduction or adaptation of the program necessary to
achieve interoperability, not just reproduction in the course of working back
from object code to a higher level language
so long as that reproduction or adaptation was confined to the parts of the
computer program necessary to achieve interoperability
and was only for the
purpose of achieving that interoperability. The LCA noted that art.6 of the EC
Directive on Computer Programs
includes reproduction or translation of program
code. (The Committee has adopted this suggestion—see paragraph 10.58).
The LCA commented that if its proposal was adopted it would permit
incorporation of protected program code in a new computer program
(or device)
where otherwise the incorporation (reproduction) of a small piece of code may be
an infringement (in light of the High
Court’s decision in the
). The LCA’s comments were echoed in the submission from SISA.
10.54 Alcatel queried the application of paragraph (c) of draft
recommendation 2.22, which provides that decompilation for interoperability
should be allowed where the acts are confined to the parts of the program
necessary to achieve interoperability, on the basis that
it is impossible to
know beforehand how much of a program needs to be decompiled. SISA also
commented that the use of the phrase
“parts of the program” in
paragraph (c) of the draft recommendation is based on the assumption that a
developer can identify
in advance those parts of the program that relate to
interoperability. SISA submitted that this will rarely be the case and suggested
that paragraph (c) should read:
(c) the acts are confined to those necessary to achieve interoperability
to ensure that the intention of the provision is not defeated. The Committee
has considered these comments. It agrees, having regard
to the limitations that
apply ie. the decompilation should only be used to achieve interoperability; and
the information obtained
should only be given to others when necessary for the
interoperability of the independently created program, that the scope of
(c) should be amended as suggested by SISA. Accordingly, the Committee
has decided that the draft recommendation should be amended
decompilation for interoperability provided, any acts of decompilation are
confined to those necessary to achieve interoperability
(see paragraph
10.55 SISA also made the following comments in addition to those referred to
above (p. 11, paragraph 3.11)
the use of the phrase “has not previously been readily available”
in paragraph (b) of the draft recommendation may require
developers to request
interface information first thereby disclosing their development plans. It may
also encourage some copyright
owners to place onerous pricing or licensing
regimes on interface specifications.
To avoid this SISA suggested paragraph (b) of draft recommendation 2.22
should be modified to read:
(b) the information to achieve interoperability has not previously been
published and is not at the time of decompilation readily
available on
reasonable terms.
10.56 The Committee notes these concerns but does not consider that they
justify an amendment to paragraph (b) such as suggested by
SISA. SISA also
suggested that there may be some doubt whether the words “owner” and
“or another person having
a right to use the copy” used by the
Committee in paragraph (a) of the draft recommendation would include a licensee.
suggested that the term “lawful possessor” should be
substituted in place of the word “owner”. The Committee
share SISA’s concerns. A purchaser will in most cases own the physical
copy although he or she may only have a licence
to use the program. Furthermore,
in its view a licensee would clearly be a person having a right to use the
For interoperability with hardware
10.57 The LCA also submitted that the exception should not be limited to
decompilation to achieve interoperability of an independently
created program
other programs
. The exception should be extended to include
decompilation to achieve the interoperability of an independently created
program with
(ie. a hardware item). Similarly, in its submission
SISA stated (p.10, paragraph 3.5):
There are occasions where the developer of new hardware, particularly a CPU,
may be required to decompile another company’s
computer program, usually
an operating system program, to ensure that new hardware will interoperate
successfully with the computer
SISA submitted that there was (p.10, paragraph 3.6):
. . . no justifiable copyright law, technology or public policy reason not to
extend . . .
the Committee’s recommendation to the creation of interoperable
hardware. In the submission the Committee received from SISA’s
equivalent, the European Committee for Interoperable Systems (ECIS), ECIS stated
that although controversy exists about
the permissibility of decompilation for
the purpose of achieving hardware interoperability nothing in the EC Directive
on Computer
Programs explicitly states that decompilation is not permitted for
that purpose. ECIS drew to the Committee’s attention Recital
Directive which states that an objective of art.6 is:
to make it possible to connect all components of a computer system, including
those of different manufacturers, so they can work together.
ECIS also pointed to Recital 10 which states that:
interconnection and interaction is required to permit all elements of
software and hardware to work with other software and hardware.
10.58 The Committee has considered these submissions. It notes that to the
extent that hardware devices embody computer programs and
those programs provide
the means by which interoperability is achieved the Committee’s draft
recommendation would appear to
already apply to those cases. However, the
Committee acknowledges that there may be cases where the interoperability of
and hardware devices may not depend on the interaction of two programs.
The Committee’s recommendation concerning decompilation
interoperability recognises the need to encourage competition as well as the
fact that in some circumstances decompilation may
be the only means available to
readily determine the underlying ideas and principles to enable the development
of an interoperable
program. These same considerations apply in respect of the
development of interoperable hardware. For these reasons the Committee
with the suggestion made by SISA. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that
decompilation of a computer program should be
allowed where it is necessary to
achieve the interoperability of an independently created computer program or
hardware device with
other programs or hardware devices provided (Recommendation
(a) decompilation is performed by the owner of a lawfully acquired copy of
the program or another person having a right to use the
copy or on their behalf
by a person authorised to do so; and
(b) the information necessary to achieve interoperability has not previously
been readily available; and
(c) the acts are confined to those necessary to achieve interoperability.
The following limitations should apply:
(i) the decompilation should only be used to achieve interoperability;
(ii) the information obtained should only be given to others when necessary
for the interoperability of the independently created
computer program or
hardware device.
For enhanced performance
10.59 Alcatel submitted that industrial programs are regarded by industry as
an essential tool. For this reason it is essential that
the purchasers have the
right to modify a program to meet their specific needs. Examples identified
included modifying a program
in circumstances where new equipment with different
operating parameters was installed. Alcatel also submitted this right should
be left to be determined by contract. In this regard the Committee recognises
that in certain circumstances timing may be an
important consideration and that
the need to modify or adapt a computer program may arise in a very tight
However, the Committee does not recommend any further
broadening of the limited circumstances in which decompilation should be allowed
beyond those discussed above in paragraphs 10.50 to 10.58. The Committee
considers that such needs should be covered by an agreement
between the
purchaser and the copyright owner (Recommendation 2.24).
For networking
10.60 Submissions to the Committee suggested that both the educational and
industrial fields may wish to modify computer programs
in order to facilitate
their use. Many of the examples amounted to modification to create interoperable
systems. One such example
is the suggestion by both the Australian Education
Council, Department of School Education (NSW)
and the Department of
Education, Queensland that users of programs which are not able to run on
networks be allowed to modify them
to do so. Such a modification would be a
modification to make the subject program interoperable with the network protocol
(ie, those programs controlling the exchange of information between
entities in a computer network) and the hardware connecting the
10.61 In respect of educational institutions, Microsoft submitted that the
adaptation of computer programs should not be allowed.
However if it were to
become permissible, adaptation should only be allowed along the lines of the
fair dealing exceptions that apply
in respect of other literary works. The
Committee notes that fair dealing would have little or no application to
networking.
10.62 In the Draft Report the Committee commented
that modification of
a program, so far as it amounts to making an adaptation of the program, would
involve the exercise of the adaptation
right—in addition to the exercise
of the reproduction right—if that was necessary to enable the adaptation
to be made.
While in the case of determining interface specifications there may
be wider developmental benefits to the industry and users generally,
particular user’s desire to modify a program for his or her particular
needs does not seem to justify an exception to the
rights. Both educational institutions and computer program manufacturers have
expressed the wish that they
should continue to negotiate licence fees for
educational copying of computer programs. The Committee concluded that the right
modify computer programs should be left to negotiation between the user and
the copyright owner or licensee. In their submissions
both Oracle Systems
(Australia) Pty Ltd (Oracle) and the LCA agreed with the Committee’s
recommendation that this matter should
be left to negotiation. Accordingly, the
Committee reaffirms the recommendation it made in the Draft Report
(Recommendation 2.25).
10.63 The use of reverse engineering to facilitate porting was partly raised
by IBM in their submission on cloning. A computer program
is said to be
“portable” if it can be readily transferred from one computer to
other computers. There are many reasons
why a user would want to take a computer
program written to run on one type of computer (type A) and modify it so it can
run on another
machine B include:
(a) type B is available to the user and type A is not;
(b) the program is required on a system which contains other programs
available only in a version for type B;
(c) type B is cheaper than type A;
(d) type B is faster than type A;
(e) type B allows more users to access its files either because it supports
more users than type A or because it has greater networking
capabilities.
Decompilation to a high level language which is substantially machine
independent (ie, to a language that can be compiled, with little
modification,
to operate on a number of different types of computers) would make porting for
these purposes considerably easier for
those users who only have access to
object code. Although there is no evidence that this is possible, disassembly
and other methods
of analysis may still be of some use in this regard.
10.64 The two major circumstances where the user might choose to modify the
program distributed for computer A are that a version
for B has not yet been
published, or that the version for A is much cheaper than that for B. Such price
differences are reasonable
as they may reflect the difference in cost associated
with development of programs on different machines, the different size of the
market for different machines, and also the number of users who might be able to
use the program simultaneously. A version for machine
A which only allows a
single user might be considerably cheaper than a version for machine B which
allows 40 users to access the
program either on one machine or through a network
connecting machines.
10.65 In some respects porting is analogous to the translation of traditional
literary works from one language to another. The publisher
in this situation is
permitted to consider the cost of translation together with the size of the new
market. The publisher can then
price versions in different languages
accordingly. Likewise, if a translation of a copyrighted literary work is
unavailable, one
must negotiate with the owner of the right to obtain a licence
to translate the work. The Committee can see no reason for distinguishing
computer programs from other literary works in this respect.
10.66 Subject to the Committee’s recommendation in chapter 6 and its
discussion of the reproduction and adaptation rights in
modification of a computer program to enable it to operate on different
computers may involve either reproducing the program or making
an adaptation of
the program. Modification of the source code to meet functional requirements of
another computer’s operating
system will involve reproduction of a
substantial part of the original program. Where the modifications are extensive
or a new version
(not being a reproduction of the program) has been written,
possibly in another language, that new version may be an adaptation of
original program. Compilation of a program in source code to object code will at
the very least amount to the making of an adaptation.
Similarly, where porting
is achieved by modifications made to the object code, it could be expected that
in most cases the modified
program will reproduce a substantial part of the
original program’s object code.
10.67 Where a computer program is published in source code (in particular in
a high level language) rather than as machine-specific
object code, the user,
without any great difficulty, can often make a running version of the program
that will operate a different
computer. This may sometimes be done by simply
compiling the source code for the other computer but more frequently by doing so
a few minor alterations to the source code. Whether the user has an
implied licence allowing them to compile the program for a wider
computers will depend on the terms of the agreement between the user and the
things, the licence agreement or,
in the absence of such an agreement, the particular facts and circumstances in
each case which
are the basis for any implied agreement. As porting a program
will involve exercising either the reproduction or adaptation right,
source code by contract. In the Draft Report
the Committee stated that it
did not see the need to recommend any changes to the Act to allow porting.
10.68The Committee received three submissions commenting on this
recommendation. Both the LCA and Oracle agreed with the position
adopted by the
Committee. In a submission from the CSIRO’s Institute of Information
Science and Engineering (CSIRO) it was
suggested that the copyright owner should
not have the right to prevent the making of changes to enable porting if the
owner was unable or unwilling to supply a suitably modified version
within a reasonable time. This submission in effect calls for
the establishment
of a statutory licence to allow the modification of computer programs in certain
circumstances. While the Committee
recognises the needs of users who require
versions of a program to run on a different type of computer to that for which
the program
was originally written the Committee considers that the right to
modify computer programs to allow them to run on other machines
should remain
the subject of negotiation with the copyright owner. The Committee also
recommends that to decompile for such purposes
should continue to be negotiated
with the copyright holder (Recommendation 2.26(a)). The Committee can see no
justification for a
scheme such as that suggested by the CSIRO (apart from the
convenience of the user). Nor does the Committee consider that such an
of the rights of the copyright owner is justified. Accordingly, it reaffirms its
draft recommendation that no change be made
to the Act to allow porting
(Recommendation 2.26(b)).
Error correction
10.69 Computer programs, even for quite small computers, are becoming
increasingly large and complex. Because they have to interact
with a wide
variety of configurations of hardware, large numbers of other programs and many
different versions of operating systems,
errors and unexpected behaviour can
occur. Debugging is a term applied to the process of identifying the source of
such errors and
rectifying them. The origins of the term go back to an era when
computers were large machines that consisted substantially of valves.
were attracted to the warmth of the valves and dead insects often came in
characteristics. Hence to
fix unexpected behaviour in such a machine, the operator had to remove all of
the dead bugs, ie, to debug
the machine. The term has since been generalised,
applying now to any source of unexpected behaviour. In its submission to the
Fujitsu suggested that a right to reverse engineer and decompile a
computer program is important (p. 17):
To ‘debug’ or solve problems in a program distributed in a
machine-readable format, an end-user or third-party maintenance
provider must be
able to disassemble portions of the program and examine the computer’s
memory values to find where the problem
10.70 The ways in which such bugs or errors
are rectified are many and
varied. Ideally the error is reported to the manufacturer, who often has
exclusive access to the source
code and hence is better equipped than most to
isolate and rectify the error. The source code is then appropriately modified
a number of consequential changes are included in the next release of the
object code.
10.71 Where the computer program is on a complex network or multi-user system
with many other interacting programs, the manufacturer
may not be able to
eliminate the error. Usually the users in such cases will have sufficient
expertise to isolate and correct the
errors themselves. The necessary action may
comprise any combination of direct modification of the source code, if the user
to it, direct modification of the object code or the creation of an
extra program or programs which are used in conjunction with
the original
program to avoid the situation which causes the behaviour. The modifications and
additional programs are often brought
together in a program which can be applied
to the original code to produce a modified version without the error. Such
programs are
appropriately labelled “patches”.
10.72 In most cases, application of the patches or the modification of source
code will amount to an adaptation or reproduction of
the program, which is an
exclusive right of the copyright owner. If these patches are supplied by the
owner, there will be an express
or implied licence to modify the program. Where
such patches are created by the user or supplied by a third party, some problems
arise. Licences which expressly grant a right to correct errors in programs are
usually limited to a small number of clients (usually
universities or research
institutions). Users of computer programs require them to operate on an ongoing
basis and where an error
is located, a solution is often required in a very
tight time frame. This means that it is often impractical to wait for the
manufacturer
to correct the error, either in their own patch or in a new
release, or to negotiate a
licence to modify the program at the time the
error becomes apparent.
10.73 Where there is an undertaking to maintain a system under a contractual
maintenance agreement, the maintenance provider may wish
to prevent the user
from modifying the code as such modifications may complicate and frustrate its
ability to ensure the system is
functional. Allowing users to modify code for
the purposes of error correction will not interfere with such agreements as they
and the Committee understands usually do, have explicit clauses excluding
liability of the manufacturer or third party maintenance
contractor if the
program is modified by the user. The rights and obligations of the praties will
depend upon the terms of the licence
or contract and the conduct of the user. It
may be that the user will lose rights because of a breach of contract.
10.74 Having regard to the functional nature of computer programs, the
Committee considers it essential that users should have the
right to correct
errors in programs where a corrected version of the program is unavailable. It
notes that in order to fix any errors
in a program it may be necessary for the
user to modify the source code or object code of the program. Such acts will
involve either
reproducing or adapting the computer program and, if not fully
within the terms of the licensed use of the program, will infringe
However, users of computer programs require them to operate on an ongoing basis.
Given the impracticality of fixing errors
in object code without making use of
decompilation, the Committee recommended in the Draft Report that reverse
engineering including
decompilation be permitted for the purposes of fixing
errors in computer programs.
Accordingly, the making by a lawful user of a computer
of a reproduction or adaptation of the program to restore its
intended functionality should not infringe copyright where a correctly
functioning version of the program is not available within a reasonable time at
a normal commercial price. The Committee notes that
what constitutes a
“reasonable time” and “normal commercial price” will
depend on the circumstances in each
case. The Committee further notes that this
recommendation, if implemented, would not prejudice any right that the purchaser
copy of the program might have against the supplier and/or producer for
damage suffered by the purchaser as a result of the error
(Recommendation
Decompilation for error correction
Consistently with the view expressed above the Committee
recommended in the Draft Report
that decompilation of a computer program
should be allowed where it is necessary to correct errors in the operation of
the program
provided (paragraph 10.72):
(a) decompilation is performed by the owner of a lawfully acquired copy of
the program or another person having a right to use the
copy or on their behalf
by a person authorised to do so;
(b) a version of the computer program free of the error has not previously
been readily available;
(c) the acts are confined to parts of the program necessary to correct the
(d) a correctly functioning version of the program is not available within a
reasonable time at a normal commercial price [and]
The following limitations should apply:
(i) the decompilation should only be used to achieve error correction;
(ii) the information obtained should only be given to others for the purpose
of correcting errors.
10.77 In relation to the making of “patches” the Committee
concluded that no special provisions were required in respect
of such programs.
However, insofar as it may be necessary to reproduce or adapt the source or
object code to ensure interoperability
of the patch program with the original
program the Committee recommended that the same limitations would apply as set
out in paragraph
10.72 of the Draft Report.
10.78 The Committee received seven submissions commenting on the draft
recommendation concerning decompilation for error correction.
Only the LCA
supported the Committee’s recommendation. It also suggested that the
exception should extend to “any reproduction
or adaptation of the program
necessary to correct the error.” In the submission received from the
United States Government
concern was expressed that the Committee’s
recommendation was too broad in that it may go too far in permitting the
dissemination
of the results of the decompilation to others for unrestricted
use. The Committee does not agree that this would be a consequence
of the draft
recommendation. It notes the relevant limitation in the recommendation is that
the information should only be “given
to others for the purpose of
correcting errors”. The US government further suggested that (p. 2):
Any information gained through reverse engineering/decompilation for the
purpose of error correction should be treated as the confidential
information of
the owner of the copyright in the program, and may not be released or otherwise
disseminated without the consent of
such owner.
The Committee does not accept that there is a justifiable need for a
limitation of the nature suggested by the US Government. Furthermore
it does not
consider it appropriate or consistent with the underlying principles of
in the manner suggested as to do
so would in effect provide defacto protection for ideas.
10.79 The CBEMA suggested that the Committee’s recommendation was
unnecessary on the grounds that it is highly unlikely that
the vendor of a
computer program would not take all steps necessary to correct the error, and
the developer of the product is in
a better place to cure flaws in the product
than any consumer. Similar comments were also made by IBM in its submission. In
regard the Committee notes that its recommendation was intended to operate
in those circumstances where the user of the program did
not have the time or
the supplier could not reasonably have been expected to be able to fix the bug
within the required time frame,
and the user has the necessary expertise. The
CBEMA also submitted that there should be a limitation on the dissemination of
products of the decompilation for use by others. The Committee notes that
the recommendation as worded in the Draft Report does not
contemplate permitting
any subsequent exploitation of either the corrected program or any information
obtained through the decompilation
10.80 IBM commented that the Committee’s recommendations regarding
decompilation in general (p. 9):
. . . unnecessarily increase the risks of piracy of the original program,
while providing users with benefits of questionable value.
In addition to its general concerns regarding piracy of software, IBM
submitted that any problems relating to the correction of errors
should be left
to the terms of the licence agreement between the supplier and the user. It also
cautioned that unauthorised attempts
to correct errors were likely to generate
their own problems.
10.81 In its submission Oracle stated that it would prefer existing copyright
principles to apply. However, it suggested that if a
limited right of
decompilation for error correction were to be permitted then the wording of the
Committee’s recommendation
should provide in sub-paragraph (b) that:
a version of the computer program free of the error has not been made
available within a reasonable time at a normal commercial price.
This in Oracle’s view would avoid what it saw as a suggestion in the
wording of the draft recommendation that the supplier had
an obligation to have
available a version of the program that did not include the error prior to the
date on which the error was
discovered by the user. Oracle also suggested that
the second limitation should be deleted as it implies that there is a right to
disclose programs to persons who are not lawful users of the particular copy of
software licensed. For the reasons given in paragraph
the Committee
does not agree with this suggestion.
10.82 SISA suggested that the Committee’s recommendation should be
expanded in scope to allow for error correction in a program
so that it will
function properly with a hardware device. The Committee can see no reason not to
allow decompilation for error correction
in these circumstances. Accordingly,
(and consistently with its recommendation concerning decompilation for
interoperability) it
recommends that decompilation for error correction be
allowed in these additional circumstances (see paragraph 10.84).
10.83 SISA noted that, as is the case where decompilation is undertaken for
interoperability, as a technical matter it would rarely
be the case that a
person trying to debug a program would be able to identify in advance the
relevant part of the programs object
code. Accordingly, SISA submitted that the
words “parts of the program” in the draft recommendation could be
thwart the intention of the recommendation. The Committee acknowledges
that in some cases this concern may be justified therefore,
it considers that
the draft recommendation should be amended to allow decompilation of those parts
of a computer program that are
reasonably necessary to identify and correct any
error (see paragraph 10.84).
10.84 The Committee has considered the submissions discussed above. It
recommends that decompilation for error correction be allowed
to ensure the
correct operation of a program with another program(s) or hardware device(s)
provided (Recommendation 2.27(b)):
(i) decompilation is performed by the owner of a lawfully acquired copy of
the program or another person having a right to use the
copy or on their behalf
by a person authorised to do so;
(ii) a version of the computer program free of the error has not previously
been readily available;
(iii) the acts are confined to those necessary to correct the error; and
(iv) a version of the program free of the error is not available within a
reasonable time at a normal commercial price.
The following limitations should apply:
(i) the decompilation should only be used to achieve error correction;
(ii) the information obtained should only be given to others for the purpose
of correcting errors.
10.85 The Committee also reaffirms that decompilation for error correction
should not be an infringement of copyright where an error
free version of the
program cannot be obtained within a reasonable time at a normal commercial price
(Recommendation 2.27(a)—see
previously paragraph 10.75). This would allow
the user of the program the opportunity to approach the copyright owner or his
agent to correct the error in accordance with any warranty agreement.
Where the manufacturer of the program is not given the opportunity
the error the onus should lie on the decompiler to show that the decompilation
was reasonably necessary to correct the
error and that it was not possible to
rely on the warranty in the time available to correct the error. Insofar as the
error correction
does not change the program, the user should be able to
continue to rely on his or her warranty.
Decompilation to understand techniques
10.86 Fujitsu’s submission to the Committee suggested that reverse
engineering and particularly decompilation of a computer
program might be needed
. . . simply to understand the ideas that underlie the current state of the
art and to improve upon them. Future generations of developers
must continue to
be able to stand on the shoulders of their predecessors.
10.87 As already noted (paragraph 10.27
above), s.40 of the Act allows
fair dealing with literary (and other) works for the purposes of research and
study and extends to
computer programs. In paragraph 10.29
the Committee
noted legal advice on what might be the scope of “research” as used
in s.40, which would appear to cover
reverse engineering and decompilation for
the purpose of, to use Fujitsu’s words, “simply understanding the
underlie the current state of the art.” In the Draft Report the
Committee commented that it saw
no need for an amendment to the Act to
address that concern. However, it also noted, research by a company for the
purpose of its
development aspirations, as distinct from that of general
community benefit, may not be within "research" as used in s.40.
10.88 The Committee received four submissions on this issue in response to
the Draft Report. Alcatel and the LCA both disagreed with
the Committee’s
recommendation that such activities remain governed by the fair dealing
provisions of the Act. Both submissions
commented that the fair dealing
provisions were too narrow in their scope as they arguably do not permit
decompilation to understand
techniques where that is done for a commercial
purpose. The LCA stated that the protection provided by copyright should not
the effect of restricting the development of knowledge (including the
understanding of the concepts and principles which underlie,
or are comprised in
a work). Given the nature of computer programs the LCA submitted that often a
general understanding of their
underlying principles will only be obtainable by
decompilation. In his submission Mr Muratore suggested that if decompilation
to be allowed then one option would be that it should (p. 9):
. . . be given upon [a] limited basis within the fair dealing provisions
thereby providing the copyright owner with the opportunity
of applying to the
Courts in appropriate cases.
10.89 Both the LCA and Mr Dan Hunter expressed the view that copyright law
should make the same concession in respect of understanding
techniques as is
made by s.23 of the CL Act for integrated circuits. Section 23 provides:
The EL rights in an eligible layout are not infringed:
(a) by making a copy or copies of the layout for the purpose of evaluating
the layout;
(b) by making an original circuit layout based on an evaluation or analysis
carried out with the use of a copy or copies referred
to in paragraph (a);
(c) by making an integrated circuit in accordance with an original circuit
layout referred to in paragraph (b); or
(d) by copying or commercially exploiting in Australia an original circuit
layout referred to in paragraph (b).”
The Committee has considered this provision of the CL Act
and decided
not to recommend the introduction of an analogous provision for computer
programs. Further it has decided that the wording
of its recommendation
regarding decompilation to understand techniques should state that the fair
dealing provisions would only apply
in respect of “non-commercial”
activities (Recommendation 2.28). In reaching this view the Committee has had
the inherently different nature of the subject-matter protected under
the CL Act. It does not accept that similar treatment of computer
programs is
appropriate in this case.
Decompilation to defeat program
10.90 Many products distributed for the personal computer market have some
form of protection to prevent copying of the program or,
, to prevent unauthorised use of the program. This may take the form of
a program lock (eg, a password) or a hardware lock (eg, the
AutoCAD lock). This
no doubt reflects the concern of the manufacturer that, while copying other than
in accordance with an express
or implied licence is an infringement, it is
impractical either to detect or to take infringement action in respect of such
Users often find these locks inconvenient and overcome them by
modifying the code to bypass the lock.
10.91 In the Draft Report the Committee said (paragraph 10.63):
Subject to the Committee’s recommendation concerning copying for
“normal use” (paragraph 10.10) and in the course
of debugging
(paragraph 10.58), the Committee is of the opinion that the modification of a
locked computer program for the purpose
of circumventing the lock should not be
permitted, nor should the subsequent copying of such modified computer programs.
Modification
of a computer program to defeat a copy protection lock will in most
cases involve either reproducing a substantial part of the original
making an adaptation of the program. These acts should continue to be prohibited
unless done with the licence of the copyright
owner. Any future amendments to
the Act should avoid eroding this protection for the copyright owner.
10.92 The Committee received five submissions on this issue. Alcatel
disagreed with the Committee’s recommendation on the ground
that (p. 5):
The ‘locking’ of programs is a form of protecting ideas and is
not within the scope of copyright. Any provision preventing
access to ideas
should be strictly limited to a period of less than five years.
The Committee accepts that the recommendation as worded in the Draft Report
would not permit decompilation for interoperability of
locked programs. The
submission from the CSIRO supported the Committee’s recommendation
provided “the locking is limited
to prevention of copying only”. The
Committee understands this to mean that it should be permissible to defeat locks
limited circumstances where a copy needs to be made for the purpose of
interoperability and error correction.
10.93 In its submission SISA, whose views were endorsed by the Computer and
Communications Industry Association (CCIA), commented
that any provision
relating to program locks should be carefully confined to ensure that such locks
could not be used to circumvent
exceptions to the rights of copyright owners. Mr
Muratore in his submission referred to the computer games market and noted that
some manufacturers included programs with their games that were recognised by
the game console. Unless a competing game contains
that program it will not be
recognised by the console and will not run. Mr Muratore commented that the
Committee’s recommendation
in the Draft Report would perpetuate this type
of monopoly by the computer game manufacturer. The Committee notes that an
allowing the decompilation of locked programs for the purpose of
interoperability would go some of the way to addressing this concern.
also submitted that copying or modification of a locked computer program should
be excepted from infringement where copying
is for the purposes of
interoperability, error correction or understanding techniques. The Committee
agrees with the thrust of these
10.94 Accordingly, the Committee now recommends, subject to the
Committee’s recommendations concerning copying for back-up copying,
interoperability, and error correction that the modification of a locked
computer program for the purpose of circumventing the lock
should be prohibited
as should subsequent copying of such modified programs (Recommendation 2.29).
Reproduction in the course of studying the
operation of a program: Article 5(3) of the EC Directive on Computer Programs
10.95 SISA submitted that so called “black box” reverse
engineering should be expressly provided for. The Committee understands
mean the study of the operation of a computer program without resorting to
decompilation of the object code. SISA claimed
that this is the most common form
of reverse engineering used in the computer industry. It further submitted that
techniques such
as line traces and memory dumps may involve a reproduction of
the program. Having regard to the
decision in the
Autodesk case
SISA commented that the need for such a provision was greater in Australia than
in the EU because the High Court in the
Autodesk case
held that the black
box reverse engineering engaged in by Mr Kelly was an infringing act.
Accordingly, it suggested the following
provision based on art.5(3) of the EC
Directive on Computer Programs be adopted.
A person having the right to use a computer program may, in the course of
that use and without the authorisation of the owner, observe,
study and test the
program to determine the underlying ideas and the other elements excluded from
protection pursuant to the definition
of computer program in s.10.
(The wording used in SISA’s definition assumes that the definition of
computer program is amended to expressly exclude “non-literal”
elements from protection.)
10.96 The Committee agrees that an exception of this nature is required. For
the reasons given in Chapter 6 the Committee has not
made any specific
recommendation in relation to the definition of a computer program expressly
excluding its behavioural aspects
from protection. However, the Committee has
argued in Chapter 9 that these non-literal elements are not presently protected
the Act. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the Act be amended to
allow the reproduction and study of computer programs in
the circumstances
contemplated in art.5(3) of the EC Directive on Computer Programs
(Recommendation 2.30).
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
10.97 The issue of reverse engineering and decompilation was the topic of
intensive debate in the European Community for some time.
That debate was
concerned mainly with the issue of interoperability of computer products, in
particular the extent to which reverse
engineering should be permitted to
determine interface specifications. The EC Directive on Computer Programs as
drafted reflects
the outcome of that debate. ECIS, composed of systems
manufacturers including Unisys, Sun Microsystems, Amdahl, Bull, Olivetti and
Fujitsu, lobbied for the inclusion in the EC Directive of specific authority to
sanction reverse engineering of computer programs.
This was strongly opposed by
the Software Action Group for Europe (SAGE) which includes IBM, Digital,
Microsoft and Lotus.
10.98 The relevant article of the EC Directive on Computer Programs is art.6
(Decompilation). It provides that, in certain circumstances,
the exclusive
rights of the owner of copyright in a computer program are not infringed by a
licensee or other person entitled to
use the program who reproduces or adapts it
to obtain information necessary
to create or operate interoperable
programs. The conditions under which this may be done are:
(a) the acts are performed by the licensee or by another person having a
right to use a copy of the program;
(b) the information necessary to achieve interoperability has not been
readily available to the person;
(c) the acts are confined to the parts of the original program necessary to
achieve interoperability.
10.99 Further, the provision does not permit the information obtained:
(a) to be used otherwise than to achieve the interoperability of the
independently created computer program;
(b) to be given to others except where necessary to achieve interoperability;
(c) to be used for the development, production or marketing of a computer
program substantially similar in its expression or for any
other act which
infringes copyright.
The position in Japan and the United
10.100 From what it has read and heard at the various hearings and meetings
it conducted, the Committee understands that there appears
to be a general
consensus that reverse engineering of computer programs is carried out routinely
in the industry around the world.
Apart from the European Union, two of the most
important markets in the world for computer programs are the United States and
The Committee does not propose to analyse the various provisions of the
respective copyright laws in those two countries. However,
it notes that in
Japan the law, if literally interpreted, would prohibit the reproduction and
adaptation of computer programs for
the purpose of reverse engineering.
Similarly, in the United States reproduction and adaptation of
computer programs for the purpose of reverse engineering are prohibited
such acts come within the “fair use” exception under the US
. As already discussed (paragraph 10.28 above), the
sanctioning of reverse engineering as a fair use where it was undertaken to
interoperability has been endorsed in the decision of the US Court of
Appeals (9th Circuit)—the
The Court found that
Accolade’s disassembly of Sega’s computer code was a fair use
because it was the only way that Accolade
could gain access to the unprotected
aspects of Sega’s games, and that Accolade’s purpose was
[1993] USCA9 19
. . . simply to study the functional requirements for Genesis compatibility
so that it could modify existing games and make them useable
with the Genesis
The Committee also notes that care is needed in balancing any
rights given in respect of reverse engineering. Too narrow a right could
development and too broad a right could grant an unfair advantage to some
developers. A right to reproduce for reverse engineering
expressed in broad
terms, and not strictly circumscribed as in, eg, the EC Directive on Computer
Programs, could be open to abuse
and hamper legitimate efforts by copyright
owners to discourage wide scale own-use unauthorised reproduction.
REVERSE ENGINEERING: COMPATIBILITY WITH
10.103 With the conclusion of the GATT negotiations the Committee has also
considered how its recommendations concerning reverse engineering
decompilation sit with Australia’s obligations under TRIPS. Article 13 of
the TRIPS Agreement deals with limitations and
exceptions to exclusive rights.
It provides:
Members shall confine limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights to
certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation
work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right
The Committee considered whether reverse engineering including
decompilation in the circumstances and for the purposes discussed above
conflict with the “normal exploitation” of the
work. None of the
Committee’s recommendations authorise activities that enable others to
“free ride” on the work
of the copyright owner. For this reason, a
majority of the Committee is of the view that the position adopted in the EC
on Computer Programs, and the Committee’s own recommendations do
not conflict with the copyright owner’s normal exploitation
of his or her
10.104 The underlying argument in support of allowing reverse engineering is
that it encourages the free flow of non-protected ideas
and stimulates the
creation of new forms of expression of those ideas for the public benefit.
Sanctioning of reverse engineering
per se, as distinct from any unauthorised
commercial or own-use reproduction or adaptation resulting from that process,
make such infringing copying of programs any more difficult to prove.
Indeed if the maker of an allegedly infringing program acknowledged
reverse engineered a competitor’s program, it would make it impossible for
the maker to deny having had the opportunity
to copy if the court was disposed
to find that the reverse engineered program sufficiently resembled the
firstmentioned program to
amount to a copy. There are plenty of cases of actions
for infringement of traditional literary works where the defendant admittedly
based the alleged copy on a study of and the ideas in the plaintiff’s
work, and where the critical issue was whether the defendant’s
copied the plaintiff’s work or only the unprotectable ideas in that work.
So where a program was developed after reverse
engineering an earlier work,
proof of infringement of that earlier work would depend on determination that it
was copied by the later
work, not that the maker reverse engineered the earlier
work. Also if it is suggested that reverse engineering might be done secretly
for the purpose of making a disguised clone of the work, it is hard to see how
confirming reverse engineering to be an infringement
of copyright will prevent
such secret activity; indeed, to do so might serve only to encourage such
10.105 While reverse engineering to produce a clone program may involve
decompilation, reproduction of the “look and feel”
of a program can
also be achieved simply by consulting documentation or by running the program
and observing its behaviour. Whether
the replication in a program of the
“look and feel” of a pre-existing program amounts to reproduction of
the earlier
program is a contentious issue (see discussion in Chapter 9). To the
extent that the “look and feel” of a program is
unprotected, reverse engineering undertaken for the purpose of replicating such
features of a program cannot be simply
condemned as unacceptable.
OTHER ISSUES
Contracting out
10.106 The Committee notes that its recommendations in this chapter regarding
interoperability, back-up copying and decompilation
of locked programs would be
of little practical effect if parties could rely on contractual provisions to
prevent these acts. The
Draft Report did not deal with this issue. At its
meeting in December 1994 the Committee considered art.9 of the EC Directive on
Computer Programs (Appendix G). Article 9(1) provides, in part, that:
Any contractual provisions contrary to Article 6 [
decompilation
the exceptions provided in Article 5(2) [
back-up copying)
observation and study
] shall be null and void.
The Committee recommends that the Act be amended to ensure that the
Committee’s recommendations concerning decompilation, back-up
copying, and
reproduction in the course of studying the operation of a program cannot be
avoided by contractual means (Recommendation
The onus of proof
10.107 In the Draft Report the Committee commented that
the suggested
additional exceptions to the copyright owner’s exclusive reproduction
right, discussed above, are of the same
nature as the fair dealing and other
exceptions in the Act, Part III, Division 3, headed “Acts not constituting
infringements
of copyright in works”, and should be provided for in that
Division. As such, the onus of showing that one of those proposed
applied would lie on the person invoking it (

(1990) 37 FCR 99
18 IPR 292).
10.108 The Committee indicated that it
believed it appropriate that a
person who copies another’s program without a licence and who seeks to
justify it under an exception
requiring the copier to have had a certain purpose
in copying should have the onus of satisfying the court that he or she had that
purpose. In their submissions responding to the Draft Report, Oracle, the LCA
and the ACC all agreed with the Committee’s recommendation.
Accordingly
the Committee affirms that recommendation. By way of further qualification the
Committee also believes that a person
should have to show that it was not
possible to rely on any warranty in the time available or required to fix the
software (Recommendation
B. NATURE OF THE USER
CROWN USE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS
10.109 Part VII of the Act deals generally with copyright and the Crown. It
contains provisions dealing with, among other things,
the use of literary works
by the Commonwealth and the States. Accordingly, the provisions of Part VII
apply to computer programs.
The provision of Part VII dealing with Crown use of
non-Crown copyright materials is s.183. Like the other provisions of Part VII,
s.183 applies to the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories. Section 183
of the Act provides a statutory licence for the Crown
to do acts in relation to
a range of copyright materials. This means that the Crown can do acts which
would otherwise infringe copyright
(such as copying) in relation to those
materials without infringing copyright. Section 7 of the Act further provides
. . . nothing in this Act renders the Crown liable to be prosecuted for an
10.110 The most important features of s.183 may be summarised as follows:
where the Crown does an act comprised in the copyright of
another person, or authorises the doing of such an act, and the act is
“for the services of” the Crown, it will not infringe that copyright
(s.183(1));
where the act is done, the Crown must as soon as possible
(unless contrary to the public interest) inform the owner of the copyright,
prescribed, of the doing of the act and furnish the owner with information which
the owner may reasonably require (s.183(4)) (It
is implicit in this subsection
that the Crown may carry out this obligation before or after the doing of the
the terms for the doing of the act are, whether before or
after the act is done, to be agreed between the Crown and the copyright
or, in default of agreement, fixed by the Copyright Tribunal (s.183(5)).
10.111 Prior to the Draft Report the Committee received submissions from
Lotus and Microsoft concerning the operation of s.183. In
its submission Lotus
argued that there was no reason why the Crown should be entitled to infringe
of an amount determined by the Copyright
Tribunal. It submitted that s.183 derived ultimately from provisions of 19th
century patents
legislation where the justification then was that the Crown
should not be hampered in the performance of its duties by the existence
intellectual property rights. Lotus claimed this justification can no longer be
sustained in view of the greatly expanded functions
of government in the present
10.112 Lotus also submitted that the
(UK) no longer contains a provision relating to the Crown use of
there should
be a substantial reduction in its scope. In this regard the Committee notes that
s.48 of the UK Act deals with material
communicated to the Crown. It applies to
literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works. Where that material is
communicated to the
Crown in the course of public business and with the licence
of the copyright owner, the Crown may under the following conditions
issue copies to the public. The conditions are:
(a) the copying or publication must be for the purpose for which the work was
communicated to the Crown or any related purpose which
could reasonably have
been anticipated by the copyright owner;
(b) the work may not be one which has previously been published except by
reason of s.48.
In its submission Lotus noted that the Crown use provisions in s.240 of
are limited in application to the Crown use of designs.
Those provisions restrict the Crown use of designs to defence purposes (defence
of the realm and foreign defence) and health service purposes.
10.113 Microsoft’s submission sought to distinguish computer programs
from other works on the grounds that they may be continually
copied or recopied
with each copy being as good as the original. Like Lotus, Microsoft expressed
concern at the potential for large
scale copying of computer programs by Crown
bodies. Microsoft noted that it had never received a notice under s.183 of the
suggested that this meant it was not required for the normal business
operation of Crown bodies. Lotus indicated it understood that
Departments had a policy not to use or rely on s.183 with respect to computer
programs. However, both Lotus and Microsoft
submitted that they had evidence of
unauthorised copying of computer programs by various government agencies.
10.114 Microsoft raised a number of other concerns in relation to the
operation of s.183 which can be summarised as follows:
s.183 limits the capacity of copyright owners to take legal
action against the Crown; injunctions are not available, redress must
before the Copyright Tribunal;
the Copyright Tribunal cannot award damages or costs (The
Committee notes s.174 of the Act provides that the Tribunal can order
the meaning of “the Commonwealth” and “a
State” is unclear. Accordingly, it is difficult for copyright owners
determine which bodies are amenable to civil actions for infringement and those
which are not;
s.183 conflicts with the “normal exploitation of the
work” and unreasonably prejudices the legitimate interests of the
Accordingly, s.183 is contrary to Article 9 of the Berne Convention.
Microsoft also noted that support for an amendment of s.183 could be gained
from noting that s.183(11) excludes from the application
of the section the
copying of works for educational purposes by Commonwealth and State educational
institutions, and that s. 135ZE
provides that nothing in Part VB of the Act
(copying of works under statutory licence by educational and other institutions)
in relation to a literary work being a computer program or a compilation
of computer programs. Accordingly, Microsoft submitted that
s.183 should be
amended by the addition of a subclause to subsection 12 worded as follows (1991,
nothing in this section applies in relation to a literary work, being a
computer program or a compilation of computer programs.
10.115 The Committee has considered the submissions by Lotus and Microsoft.
It does not accept Microsoft’s submission that computer
programs are
distinguishable from other works on the grounds that they may be continually
copied or recopied with each copy being
as good as the original. In this regard
it notes that digital storage of musical, artistic and other literary works is
quite commonplace.
All forms of digital storage lend themselves to high quality
copying. Further the Committee is not persuaded that much significance
attached to the fact that computer programs are usually digital. It notes that
high quality analogue copying of musical,
literary and artistic works is
available both commercially and domestically. Almost endless high quality
analogue copies can also
be made from a single analogue or digital original.
10.116 The Crown is an extremely large user of copyright materials. The
extensive range of functions discharged by various Government
departments at the
State and Federal levels means that there is a wide scope for the Crown to copy
a variety of materials in the
performance of these functions. From a
consideration of the provisions of s.183 it is apparent to the Committee that
the scheme established
the section, on the one hand, recognises the
needs of the Crown to make extensive use of copyright materials but, on the
other hand,
also seeks to strike a balance by ensuring that the exception does
not lead to abuse. This is evidenced by the notice requirements
some difficulties may be faced by copyright
owners under s.183 in determining
whether or not a body or organisation is the Crown. These problems are not faced
by the owners
of copyright in computer programs alone. They apply in relation to
all works and subject matter.
10.117 The Committee notes the allegations by both Microsoft and Lotus that
there appears to be some copying of computer programs
by the Crown and that, as
far as those two copyright owners are concerned, there is little if any
reporting of that copying in compliance
with the requirements of s.183. The
Committee understands that, at the federal level, the Attorney-General’s
Department has
adopted a policy of not copying programs and has advised this
approach to other departments that have consulted it. From the submissions
not possible for the Committee to gauge the size or seriousness for the owners
of copyright in computer programs of government
copying that has not been
notified as required. However, the Committee accepts that copyright owners have
a real basis for concern
if it can be shown that Government departments and
other bodies that are “the Commonwealth” and “a
are abusing the statutory licence provided under s.183. In
the Draft Report the Committee noted the finding of the Victorian
Auditor-General
that one in four software products in use in the Victorian
public sector were unlicensed.
10.118 In the case of, for instance, readily available packaged computer
programs, the substantial function for which they would be
put to normal use and
the substantial cost (compared with, say, newspapers, magazines and books) would
suggest that governments would
not have the same case for having the present
right under s.183 as they might in the case of newspapers, magazines and
Against this the Committee accepts that there may be circumstances
where the government should be able to copy computer programs.
In the Draft Report
the Committee recommended that s.183
be amended to provide that copying for the services of the Commonwealth and
States of computer
programs should be restricted to those cases where a copy of
the program cannot be obtained within a reasonable time at an ordinary
commercial price. In making this recommendation the Committee acknowledged that
the demands of government are such that the
proposed curtailment of the
operation of s.183 in relation to computer programs should not be presumed to be
adaptable to other works
or other subject matter without consideration of all
relevant circumstances.
10.120 In response to the Draft Report the Committee received five
submissions concerning Crown use of computer programs and the electronic
of works by the crown. Both the ACC and Copyright Agency Limited urged the
Committee to address the question of the entry
of works onto data bases by
government departments. As this issue relates to that aspect of the
Committee’s terms of reference
concerning the storage of works in computer
memory these submissions are dealt with in Chapter 14 of the report.
10.121 The LCA, ACC, AIIA, Oracle and De Data all supported the
Committee’s recommendation in the Draft Report. In its comments
suggested that the wording adopted by the Committee should be made “less
vague”. The Committee understands this
comment to be a reference to the
words “reasonable time” and “ordinary commercial price”.
The reason those
words were chosen is that they are used elsewhere in the Act,
in particular in the fair dealing provisions (see s.40). The Committee
aware that the use of those words in that context has given rise to any
particular difficulties in the application of those
provisions. In light of this
the Committee is disinclined to suggest a different test. De Data commented that
in addition to the
Committee’s recommendation, s.183 (p. 6):
. . . should be further amended to include, at least in the case of time
being a factor, that the copyright owner will be granted
appropriate
compensation before or after the act of copying the computer program(s).
The Committee notes here that s.183(5) provides a mechanism whereby copyright
owners are assured of receiving compensation.
10.122 The final additional comment the Committee received was from Oracle
suggesting that the Committee’s recommendation should
be further tightened
by requiring that notification be given within thirty days if the Crown sought
to rely on the statutory licence.
The Committee understands that the
notification provisions of s.183 are currently being reviewed. For this reason
it does not amend
its earlier recommendation in respect of these proposals (see
paragraph 10.119) (Recommendation 2.33).
10.123 The Committee did not receive a large number of submissions on this
particular issue (no submissions were received commenting
Committee’s draft recommendation). Those that it did receive were uniform
in their opposition to the introduction of
a scheme (analogous to the Blank Tape
Royalty Scheme in the now invalid Part VC of the Act) to impose a levy upon
floppy discs as
a means of compensating computer program manufacturers for home
copying of their programs. Perhaps surprisingly, this view was endorsed
by computer program manufacturers but also the Australian Federation of
Consumers Organisations and the PC Users Group.
10.124 The main reasons why such a scheme was regarded by these interests as
inappropriate were:
(a) the value of the levy would in no way represent the value of program
copied. (Unlike sound recordings the prices of which are
very similar, computer
program packages can vary in price from tens to thousands of dollars);
(b) the purchase of programs by organisations would not necessarily give an
accurate indication of the amount of copying of particular
(c) computer programs, unlike sound recordings, often require the provision
of support from suppliers. This needs to be financed through
(d) allowing copying for the payment of a fee would further encourage copying
and promote a view within the community that copying
was acceptable when in fact
it equates to stealing the intellectual property; and
(e) collecting societies are a costly and unsatisfactory mechanism for
recouping income lost to copying.
10.125 In the Draft Report the Committee noted that voluntary licensing of
copying of computer programs by individual copyright owners
or their licensees
may be a practical option
In contrast with other copyright works or
subject matter such as sound recordings
there is a relatively smaller
number of makers of computer programs and usually only one copyright to deal
with (compared with sound
recordings, for which there are copyrights in not only
the recording but also both the music and the words to consider as well as
enormous range of composers). The Committee also acknowledged arguments that
computer programs can be distinguished from sound
recordings on the basis of
price and the need for support service. Having regard to this and the fact that
both consumer organisations
and computer program manufacturers oppose the
introduction of such a levy or royalty scheme, the Committee reaffirms its draft
recommendation
that no change be made to the Act in respect of unauthorised home
copying of computer program
(Recommendation 2.34).
C. NATURE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER
SHAREWARE AND PUBLIC DOMAIN COMPUTER
10.126 At the public hearings and in a submission received following the
hearings, the concepts of “public domain” computer
programs and
“shareware” were discussed. From the submissions, the Committee
understands that those concepts are as follows:
(a) Public domain computer programs—programs which the copyright owner
has granted the world at large a licence to reproduce.
While copyright subsists
in such programs the copyright owner is, however, precluded from claiming
damages from anyone who reproduces
the program.
(b) Shareware—programs which have been made available for users to
reproduce and use free of charge subject to certain conditions.
conditions that apply to shareware are that it is freely transferable to other
users provided that after a specified period
the user(s) cease to use it or make
a payment to the copyright owner.
10.127 Discussion of these two terms at the public hearings indicated that
there was some confusion as to their meaning. There was
also concern expressed
by some users that in some cases it was not clear whether a program was in the
public domain. In the Draft
Report the Committee expressed
the view that
although there may be some public uncertainty as to the meaning of the terms and
into which category a particular program
may fall, these considerations alone
are not sufficient to necessitate legislative clarification of the terms. In the
any further submissions on this issue the Committee reaffirms its
recommendation in the Draft Report that no amendments be made to
define these terms (Recommendation 2.35).
OVERLAP OF THE COPYRIGHT ACT 1968 AND THE CIRCUIT
LAYOUTS ACT 1989
10.128 In the Draft Report the Committee referred to submissions it had
from Apple, Avel Pty Ltd (Avel) and Microsoft concerning the
operation of s.24(2) of the CL Act, which provides for the protection
intellectual property in the designs of integrated circuits, ie, computer chips.
Section 24 of the CL Act
concerns the commercial exploitation of original
designs for integrated circuits, called in the CL
Act “eligible
layouts”. Commercial exploitation is defined in s.8 of that Act to include
sale and other distribution by
way of trade and the importation for various
commercial purposes. In effect, if an eligible layout is commercially exploited
in Australia
or elsewhere by, or with the permission of, the owner of
intellectual property in the layout, s.24 provides that it is not an
infringement
of those rights if a person acquires a copy of the layout, or an
integrated circuit made from the layout, and commercially exploits
Australia. As can be seen, that would include importing the layout, or chips
lawfully made according to the layout, into Australia
10.129 Section 24(2) of the CL Act
In spite of
that Act to the extent that section 38 applies to imported articles, where the
commercial exploitation of an integrated circuit
containing a copy or adaptation
of a work (being an integrated circuit made in accordance with an eligible
layout) is not, under
this section, an infringement of the EL rights in the
layout, that commercial exploitation is not an infringement of the copyright
that work unless the making of that copy or adaptation was an infringement of
that copyright.
In its submission Microsoft noted that the explanatory memorandum and the
placement of this provision indicated that the intent of
the sub-section was to
prevent the owner of EL rights in a layout from including a trivial computer
program in an integrated circuit
made according to the layout and thus take
advantage of the
to prevent parallel importation of the
integrated circuit.
10.130 The Committee understands that the CL Act
was enacted to ensure
that Australian circuit layouts would be protected in the US under the US
Semiconductor Chip Protection Act 1984
(US SCP Act) and to enable
Australia to become a party to any future multilateral convention for the
protection of circuit layouts.
While, as noted by the Committee in Chapter 3
(paragraph 3.18), the Washington Treaty has not yet entered into force, s.24 of
nevertheless gives effect to art.6.5 of the Treaty, which
deals with the exhaustion of rights. Article 6.5 provides:
(5) [Exhaustion of Rights] Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(a)(ii), any
Contracting Party may consider lawful the performance, without
the authorisation
of the holder of the right, of any of the acts referred to in that paragraph
where the act is performed in respect
of a protected layout-design (topography)
or in respect of an integrated circuit in which such a layout design
(topography) is incorporated,
that has been put on the market by, or with the
consent of, the holder of the right.
Paragraph (1)(a) provides:
(1) [Acts Requiring the Authorisation of the Holder of the Right] (a) Any
Contracting Party shall consider unlawful the following
acts if performed
without the authorisation of the holder of the right:
(i) the act of reproducing, whether by incorporation in an integrated circuit
or otherwise, a protected layout-design (topography)
in its entirety or any part
thereof, except the act of reproducing any part that does not comply with the
requirement of originality
referred to in Article 3(2),
(ii) the act of importing, selling or otherwise distributing for commercial
purposes a protected layout-design (topography) or an
integrated circuit in
which a protected layout-design (topography) is incorporated.
10.131 A similar provision to art.6.5 is found in the US SCP Act. Section
906(b) of the US SCP Act provides:
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 905(2), [Exclusive rights in mask
works] the owner of a particular semiconductor chip product
made by the owner of
the mask work or by any person authorised by the owner of the mask work, may
import, distribute, or otherwise
dispose of or use, but not reproduce, the
particular semiconductor chip product without the authority of the owner of the
In the explanatory memorandum for the US SCP Act the paragraph dealing with
s.906(b) provides in part:
. . . section 906(b) . . . relates to application of the first sale doctrine
to mask works. It is made clear that a customer is free
to use a semiconductor
chip product unit as he chooses, after becoming its owner or buying it from the
mask work owner or its licensee.
However, the customer’s permissible use
does not include reproducing the semiconductor chip . . .
10.132 The Explanatory Memorandum for the CL Act
provides, in relation
to s.24(2) (p. 18, paragraph 51):
The intended effect of sub-clause (2) is that sub-clause (1) is not defeated
by the application of
sections 37
imported copies or adaptations of a work, made with the authority of the
10.133 When considering the issues raised by Apple, Avel and Microsoft, the
Committee noted that the US SCP Act does not have an equivalent
provision to
s.24(2). When preparing the Draft Report the Committee sought clarification of
the US position, in particular whether
any problems had arisen under the US SCP
Act in relation to the importation of semi-conductor chips, through the
Attorney-General’s
Department’s Counsellor (Legal) in Washington. In
his reply the Counsellor (Legal) advised that the US Administration, including
the US Customs Service, were not aware of any particular problems with the
operation of s.906(b). Nor were they aware of any case
where an attempt had been
made to prevent the importation of a computer product containing an integrated
circuit. The Committee notes
that the US SCP Act is expressed not to derogate
from the protection available under the US
Accordingly, it appears that “back door” copyright protection for
circuit layouts may be possible in the US by the inclusion
of copyright works in
integrated circuits.
10.134 The Committee is of the view that, having regard to art.6.5 of the
Washington Convention, s.906(b) of the US SCP Act and s.24(1)
of the CL Act, it
is clear that the policy underlying these provisions is that the owner of the
rights in a circuit layout should
not enjoy the right to control the parallel
importation of circuit layouts once they have been legitimately placed on the
It is also clear from the explanatory memorandum to the CL Act
that the purpose of s.24(2) is to ensure that the owners of rights in
circuit layouts are not able to achieve copyright protection
by the inclusion of
10.135 Apple, Avel and Microsoft all expressed concern that the effect of
s.24(2) is to deny parallel importation protection under
ss.37 and 38 of the Act
to all works stored in ROM. The submission from Avel noted that, in the case of
products sold by it, namely
printed circuit boards for video games, the programs
which operate the games are all encoded in integrated circuits. Two types of
integrated circuits are commonly used, the first type are EPROMs which are
purchased “off the shelf” and the programs
are loaded directly by
the games manufacturer (who also incorporates the programmed EPROM into the
printed circuit board). The second
Mask ROM. These are specially designed integrated circuits, where the computer
is incorporated by the circuit
manufacturer. Avel noted that
s.24(2) applied to both of these cases. It submitted that simply because the
author of a computer program
chose to store the program in an EPROM, he or she
should not lose copyright protection. Avel also noted that if the same program
were stored on a floppy disc, it would not attract the operation of s.24(2) and,
accordingly, the copyright owner would still be
able to exercise his or her
rights to control the importation of the program under the
In other words the effect of s.24(2) is that it discriminates against programs
embodied in integrated circuits.
10.136 The Committee notes that the application of s.24(2) to the products
sold by Avel was considered by the Full Court of the Federal
[1992] FCA 308
(1992) 36 FCR 340
[1992] FCA 308
23 IPR 353.
In so doing,
the Full Court referred extensively to the Second Reading speech by the then
Attorney-General, when introducing the
Circuit Layouts Bill into Parliament in
1988, as an indication of the purpose in enacting the legislation. Avel had
contended that
s.24(2) did not apply to programs consisting of games when stored
in EPROMs by someone other than the manufacturer of the EPROMs.
Avel contended
that s.24(2) was directed only to programs stored in integrated circuits by the
circuit manufacturer, with whom the
Act was concerned. In holding that s.24(2),
properly construed, did apply to programs stored in blank EPROMs by a purchaser
the manufacturer, the Full Court said that
[1992] FCA 308
(36 FCR 340
[1992] FCA 308
Nor does this conclusion fit uneasily within the purpose of the legislation .
. . A person importing a chip into Australia, having
purchased it as a result of
commercial exploitation abroad, does not obtain, as a result of s. 24 or
any other section in the Layouts
Act, the right to reproduce the computer
program [stored in the chip]. So to do would remain an infringement of the
All s. 24(2) ensures is that the commercial exploitation of the
chip in Australia will not be hindered in such a case, provided that
of the copy or adaptation of the work stored in the chip and otherwise the
subject of copyright protection did not constitute
a copyright infringement.
To expand on that point, the Committee noted in the Draft Report that
computer programs stored on integrated circuits abroad are not
totally deprived
by s.24(2) of protection accorded to works under s.37 of the
, but only when imported in integrated circuits made in accordance with
an eligible layout. Thus copyright protection of copies of
a program on disc or
tape, or indeed stored in a circuit made according to a layout for which
protection has run out (remembering
that it lasts for a maximum of 20 years)
would not be cut down by s.24(2).
10.137 The Committee also noted, by way of contrast, that in the earlier case
Star Micronics Pty Ltd
Five Star Computers Pty Ltd
(a decision handed down prior to the commencement of the relevant
provisions of the
CL Act on 1 October 1990), the Federal Court held that
a copy of a computer program embodied in an integrated circuit contained in
printer was protected by copyright. It held that the importation, by the
respondent in that case, of the printers into Australia,
without the licence of
the owner of copyright in the program infringed the copyright in the program.
Accordingly, the plaintiff was
able to control the importation of a
non-copyright article by relying on the copyright subsisting in computer
programs stored in
integrated circuits used in the printer.
10.138 The Committee stated in the Draft Report that it believed that the use
of copyright in the packaging and labelling of non-copyright
articles was an
appropriate analogy. The packaging and labelling of non-copyright articles was
considered in the Committee’s
1988 report on
The Importation Provisions
(pp. 223–226). The Committee there
recommended that the Act should be amended so that the copyright in packaging
and labelling
could not be used to control the importation and subsequent
commercial dealing with non-copyright articles. The Committee notes that
December 1992, the
was introduced into Parliament
to amend the
, inter alia, to prevent the copyright in
product packaging being used by distributors to create exclusive markets for
non-copyright
goods. However, when a Federal election was called in March 1993,
this Bill lapsed. Similar provisions have not as yet been reintroduced.
10.139 In the Draft Report the Committee stated that in its view the intended
effect of s.24(2) of the CL Act was clearly to prevent
a similar control over
importation of integrated circuits by storage on them of copyright computer
programs or other articles. The
Committee concluded that the policy behind the
drafting of s.24(2) could be stated as follows (paragraph 10.100):
Circuit layouts and integrated circuits are non-copyright utilitarian
articles. The nature of the intellectual property rights in
such articles does
not include the right to control the importation of legitimate copies of the
article. Furthermore the rights owner
should be prevented from obtaining
them. The Committee
is not persuaded that the apparent policy behind s.24(2)
should be altered.
Accordingly, the Committee recommended that no change
should be made
to s.24(2) of the
CL Act (paragraph 10.100).
10.140 The Committee received five submissions concerning this
recommendation. Only the submission from the CSIRO unreservedly supported
position adopted by the Committee. In a paper forwarded to the Committee by Mr
Yves Hazan, of Michell Sillar Australian and International
Attorneys, Mr Hazan
commented that the Committee’s recommendation had implications for the use
of copyright works in multimedia
products many of which would be stored on
integrated circuits. In its submission Oracle made a similar comment and
suggested that
it should be possible to maintain the purpose of s.24(2) while
not affecting the rights in works stored in integrated circuits. The
submissions
from Mr Hazan and Avel also commented that the scope of copyright protection for
works should not in this case depend
upon the nature of the media in which they
are stored. Mr Hazan cautioned that such an approach had the potential to (p.
. . . result in suppliers of technology not providing the best possible or
most desirable technology for a particular solution in
order to ensure
protection of their copyright.
10.141 The final submission on this issue came in a paper delivered by Mr Dan
Hunter of the Centre for International Research on Communication
and Information
Technologies (CIRCIT). In his paper Mr Hunter was critical of the Committee for
describing integrated circuits as
“utilitarian and somehow different from
between integrated circuits and copyright materials is recognised
internationally in the TRIPS Agreement and by the Berne and Washington
The distinction put simply is that the CL Act protects the designs for
integrated circuits and their embodiment in a chip
while copyright protects
works which may be stored in integrated circuits. The Committee acknowledges
that both may perform the same
function. However, it is not the function of the
computer program or the circuit layout that is the object of the protection. The
fact that these two distinct subject matters can be embodied in the one physical
object is precisely what gives rise to the difficulties
under s.24(2).
10.142 The Committee has considered the comments made in these submissions.
It agrees with the comment by Oracle that it should be
possible to give effect
to the intention of s.24(2) while not affecting the rights in works stored in
integrated circuits. Accordingly,
the Committee now recommends that where the
purpose of importing an integrated circuit is to import a copyright work
embodied in
that integrated circuit the owner of copyright in the embodied work
should be able to control that importation (ie the
apply) (Recommendation 2.36(a)). Where the purpose of the importation is to
import an article that is not the copyright work
then the CL Act should apply
(Recommendation 2.36(b)). In other words, where the work embodied in a chip is
the only or principal
reason of the importation, s.24(2) of the CL Act should
10.143 Apple and Microsoft also expressed concern at the operation of s.24(3)
of the CL Act which provides:
Expressions used in subsection (2) that are used and defined in the
have the same respective meanings in that subsection
as they have in that Act.
Both Apple and Microsoft argued that because of s.24(3), s.24(2) must be
interpreted as not applying to works made outside Australia.
In their view,
“copyright” under the
means copyright
subsisting by reason of that Act. The making of any article outside Australia
cannot be an infringement of copyright
under the Australian
and therefore
does not apply to works made outside Australia. To avoid
this problem in respect of computer programs, Apple submitted that
should be amended by the addition of the words “not being a computer
program” after the word “work” where

Committee therefore does not agree with the suggestion

including the provision in the CL
Act. The Committee did not receive any
further comments on this issue following the release of the Draft Report.
Parallel Importation
INTRODUCTION
11.01 In the Draft Report the Committee indicated that it was split fairly
evenly on the issue of whether to allow the parallel importation
of computer
programs, computer manuals and second-hand computer programs. The Draft Report
referred to a “bare” majority
being in favour of lifting the current
restriction on parallel importation. The members of the Committee who formed the
recommended that the parallel importation of computer programs,
computer manuals, whether or not sold together with computer programs,
second-hand computer programs should be allowed from those countries which
represent the main source of such goods currently
used in Australia (Draft
recommendations 2.31 and 2.33). A minority of the Committee remained opposed to
permitting the parallel
importation of computer programs.
11.02 The Committee has moved from the position it took in the Draft Report.
The Committee’s reasons and major recommendations
regarding parallel
importation are set out in paragraphs 11.93–11.96 following the discussion
below of the issues and submissions
it received.
TERMINOLOGY
11.03 In the Draft Report, the majority of the Committee in making its
recommendation regarding parallel importation referred to “computer
On the other hand, in the PSA’s final report its
recommendations were made in relation to “computer software”
Neither of these terms were defined or their use clarified either by the
Committee or the PSA. The implication of the Committee’s
use of the term
“computer program” is that if only “computer programs”
may be imported, the copyright owner
may nevertheless retain control over
parallel importation in relation to any other copyright material stored with the
program. Similarly,
in the Committee’s view, the use of the term
“computer software” leads to some uncertainty if undefined. It is
not clear, for example, whether the PSA intended “software” to mean
computer programs and ancillary data stored on the
same device, or whether the
PSA intended “software” to have a wider meaning (for example, to
include things such as databases
on CD–ROM, where the computer program is
arguably ancillary to the data.
11.04 The Committee has assumed, for the purposes of the discussion in this
chapter, that references to “software” in
the PSA report, responses
to it, and submissions to the Committee, are intended to refer to computer
programs and ancillary data
stored on the same carrier. The use of the term
“computer program” by the Committee should also be understood as
to a computer program and ancillary data but not including associated
1988—REPORT ON THE IMPORTATION PROVISIONS OF
THE COPYRIGHT ACT 1968
11.05 The Committee considered and reported on the importation provisions of
the Act in September 1988 as they affected a range of
industries, including the
book publishing, sound and record and computer software industries (
Importation Provisions of the
, AGPS, Canberra, 1988)
(1988 Report). The matters then considered by the Committee regarding computer
programs were the:
• possible repeal of ss.37 and 38 of the Act to meet concerns regarding
the price and availability of computer programs;
• extension of the scope of s.135 of the Act, that provides for customs
seizure of infringing imported (ie, unlicensed) copies
of print materials, to
include computer programs;
•possible decriminalisation of parallel importation; and
• the importation of non-copyright articles containing computer
Recommendations made in the 1988 Report
11.06 In its 1988 Report the Committee recommended that the parallel
importation provisions should continue to apply in relation to
computer software
and other copyright materials but that their application to such imports should
be relaxed in a number of respects
(paragraphs 2 and 198). In particular, the
Committee recommended that unlicensed importation by a person engaged in trade
or commerce
should be allowed either where a specific order for an article is
made by a customer or where the article sought to be imported is
unavailable in
Australia for longer than a reasonable period (see paragraphs 3(1) and 3(2)).The
Committee’s 1988 recommendations
in relation to the issue of availability
of copyright materials are referred to again in paragraphs 11.64 and 11.65.
11.07 The Committee also recommended that s.135 of the Act, which provides a
mechanism for copyright owners to restrict the importation
of printed copies of
works, should be amended to cover all works and subject matter other than works,
including computer programs
and to apply to exclusive licensees of copyright
material as well as to owners thereof (1988 Report—paragraph 3(6)). The
implementation
of this recommendation in the
Amendments) Bill 1994
is discussed later at paragraphs 11.89 and 11.90.
11.08 Further recommendations of the Committee concerned the
decriminalisation of parallel importation and the knowledge requirements
parallel importation provisions. First, in relation to the issue of
decriminalisation the Committee considered that a person
who imported a
non-pirated article ought not to be subject to criminal proceedings and
sanctions, provided that the onus, in civil
proceedings, was placed on the
importer to show that the imported articles were not pirate copies (1988
Report—paragraphs 3(5)
and 200). The Committee’s current view in
relation to this issue in the light of its recommendation in this report is
at paragraph 11.13. Second, in relation to the knowledge requirement
in the importation provisions the Committee recommended that
ss. 37, 38, 102 and
103 be amended to bring them into line with s.132 which only requires a
“knew or ought reasonably to
have known” that the imported article would have constituted an
infringement of copyright
if made by him/her in Australia (in their existing
form the parallel importation provisions required proof of actual knowledge on
the part of the importer). This recommendation was implemented by the
. In 1992 the Government introduced the
which proposed that the knowledge requirement be
removed altogether from ss. 37 and 102 of the Act. However, with the calling of
the March 1993 Federal election this bill lapsed and the Committee notes the
Bill has not yet been reintroduced.
11.09 Finally, the Committee noted in its 1988 Report that there was a
potential for abuse of the importation provisions of the Act,
by allowing
to be used to control importation of
those articles. However, it did not make a
specific recommendation on this issue. This issue is discussed in Chapter 10
(paragraphs
10.128–10.142).
Response to 1988 recommendations
11.10 In the Draft Report in Chapter 11 the Committee noted that it had
received a number of submissions concerning its 1988 recommendations
favour and not in favour of the recommendations (paragraphs 11.05–11.08).
The submissions were clearly split between
those with an interest in the
computer industry and those advocating consumer interests. Those submissions not
in favour of the recommendations
came from the major computer industry
associations, the Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA) and the
Australian Software
Distributors Association Limited (ASDA) and a number of
individual companies including Apple Computer Inc and Apple Computer Australia
Pty Limited (Apple), Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd (Autodesk), Dataflow Computer
Services Pty Ltd (Dataflow), Infomagic Australia Pty
Limited (Infomagic), Lotus
Development Pty Ltd (Lotus), Microsoft Pty Limited (Microsoft), Mindscape
International Pty Limited (Mindscape),
Roland DG Australia Pty Ltd (Roland),
Star Micronics Pty Ltd (Star Micronics), and Sun Microsystems Australia Pty Ltd
(Sun Microsystems).
The position taken by the computer industry was supported by
the Australian Copyright Council (ACC) and the Software and Services
Federation of Australia Limited (SSIFA).
11.11 Submissions received from the Australian Consumers’ Association
(ACA), Comprepair, Computermate Products (Australia) Pty
Ltd (Computermate), the
Curtin University of Technology (WA), the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs
(FBCA), Halldale Technologies
Pty Ltd, and the Western Australian Department of
State Services all urged various degrees of change to the importation
provisions.
The FBCA argued that difficulties for distributors should not
outweigh the greater choice for consumers or competition likely to
parallel importation was allowed. The ACA claimed that the options provided by
parallel importation would reveal plainly
to consumers the costs of after-sales
service. Where the value of services provided was commensurate with their costs,
agents would
prosper and industry performance would benefit.
11.12 Paragraph 11.06 of the Draft Report also noted the summary by the Law
Council of Australia (LCA) of the arguments before the
. . . on the one hand, that the current law has the effect of increasing the
prices and decreasing the availability of copyright articles
in Australia. On
the other hand, these claims were denied and it was further claimed that the
international copyright system is based
on a territorial framework and that if
the current importation provisions are repealed or drastically altered this may
well result
in many producer industries not providing for the Australian market
and also not subsidising the Australian publishing and manufacturing
which are reliant on such subsidies.
and the view of the LCA that given the submissions made to the Committee (p.
. . . no changes to the existing law in relation to the parallel importation
of copyright material should take place until investigations
into the merits of
conflicting claims submitted to the CLRC are carried out.
DECRIMINALISATION OF PARALLEL IMPORTATION
11.13 As mentioned in paragraph 11.08 the Committee recommended in its 1988
Report that parallel importation should be decriminalised
provided that the
onus, in civil proceedings, was placed on the importer to show that the imported
articles were not pirate copies.
The Committee did not receive any further
comments on this recommendation in the submissions it received concerning this
The Committee’s 1988 recommendation was made in the context of
a limited right to allow parallel importation to meet specific
orders where a
product was not available. However, as the Committee is of the view that the
parallel importation provisions, as they
apply to computer programs should be
maintained and that availability of computer programs is not a pressing problem,
the Committee
recommends that criminal sanctions in respect of parallel
importation should remain. (Recommendation 2.38).
IMPORTATION OF NON-COPYRIGHT ARTICLES CONTAINING
COMPUTER PROGRAMS
11.14 In the Draft Report the Committee noted the concerns of Apple in
relation to the wording of the Committee’s 1988 recommendations
may facilitate avoidance of the importation provisions (paragraph 11.19). The
Committee invited submissions on the issue
raised, but expressed the initial
view that as a matter of policy, the sale and distribution of functional, or
non-copyright, utilitarian
articles should not be made subject to copyright
control by the inclusion of copyright materials in those articles. The Committee
has now addressed this issue fully in Chapter 10 and accordingly refers readers
to the relevant part of that chapter (from paragraph
1990—ISSUES PAPER ON COMPUTER SOFTWARE
11.15 Submissions received by the Committee in response to its Issues Paper
of April 1990 raised the following additional matters
for consideration:
• the overlap between the Act and the
Circuit Layouts Act 1989
(CL Act), in particular, s.24(2) of the CL Act;
•the importation of computer manuals; and
•the importation of second hand computer programs.
The first issue is discussed in Chapter 10, paragraphs 10.128–10.144
while the second two issues are discussed in paragraphs
11.97 –11.198 and
11.104–11.105 respectively.
1992—PSA’S REPORT ON ITS INQUIRY INTO
PRICES OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE
11.16 As mentioned in paragraph 3.07, the PSA completed its inquiry into the
prices of computer software and presented its final report
on 15 December 1992.
It recommended that:
• ss.37 and 38 of the Act be repealed in relation to parallel imports
of computer programs and associated manuals from countries
signatory to the
Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention;
• s.135 of the Act be amended to cover pirate and counterfeit computer
• s.135(2) and 135(3) that require the copyright owner to give notice
in writing to the Comptroller-General of the Australian
Customs Service be
repealed as they apply to computer programs; and
• the PSA be asked to monitor the impact on prices of the repeal of the
importation provisions as they apply to non-pirate computer
programs after an
appropriate period of time.
These recommendations are discussed in paragraphs 11.81–11.91 with the
exception of the last mentioned recommendation on which
the Committee makes no
CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES
11.17 The benefits and possible adverse effects of the provisions which allow
owners of copyright to control parallel importation
have been the subject of
wide debate in Australia and in international arenas such as the World
Intellectual Property Organisation
(WIPO) and as part of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations. Despite the high level of debate, the
of whether to allow parallel importation remains contentious, largely
because the economic effects of allowing or restricting parallel
importation are
difficult, if not impossible, to measure. Those in favour of allowing parallel
importation point to other areas in
which the Government has recently
implemented policies designed to increase competition, such as telephone
services and air travel.
In the Committee’s view, it is questionable
whether these comparisons provide useful assistance. Set out below is a
of the reasons for the Committee’s view that parallel
importation in relation to computer programs should not be allowed
PURPOSE OF PARALLEL IMPORT PROVISIONS
11.18 Before considering the arguments in favour of restricting parallel
importation, the Committee thinks it is useful to acknowledge
the fundamental
purpose of parallel importation provisions. In the Committee’s opinion the
right to control parallel importation
of copyright materials serves the same
purpose as copyright laws in general—to encourage and reward investment
and creative
endeavour. The parallel importation provisions recognise that
result of various international treaties, vary from territory to territory. They
also recognise, as pointed out by the Law Council
of Australia (LCA), that there
is not a “single world market”. The parallel importation provisions
provide an incentive
for copyright owners in one territory to market (and
exclusively license others to market) their copyright, and articles
incorporating
their copyright, in other territories. This incentive is negated
if others may import those articles from other territories without
incurring the
marketing and other costs incurred by the owner of copyright.
11.19 As pointed out by the LCA in its submission, the exercise of copyright
rights necessarily has an effect on prices and short
term availability of
articles to the extent that it allows copyright owners to recoup their
investment and prevent others from free-riding
on that investment. The LCA
refers to the following comment by Professor Cornish in his text I
ntellectual
Property: Patents, Copyright, Trade Marks and Allied Rights
(2nd. ed, Sweet
and Maxwell, London, 1989, p.259, paragraph 9-024) which explains the impact of
the market:
That such practices [such as publishing hardback editions before paperbacks,
or releasing a film for cinema exhibition before showing
it on television]
should follow from the conferring of copyright is not of itself a ground for
criticism. The very purpose of the
protection is to allow recoupment for the
initiative of creating the material and the investment risked in producing and
it. In most instances a copyist could produce a directly competing
product at a much lower cost if copyright did not restrain him.
11.20 In the Committee’s opinion, it is essential to bear in mind the
underlying purpose and effect of parallel importation
controls (and copyright
generally) in considering the local Australian market and its operation and
impact on consumers. It should
also be remembered that the parallel importation
provisions complement the general bundle of rights which copyright owners are
and, as pointed out by the Australian Copyright Council (ACC), parallel
importation controls are intended to “ensure the effective
of the rights of copyright owners. The Committee is of the opinion that parallel
importation provisions must be maintained
if copyright owners are to have
effective control over their copyright materials.
ARGUMENTS CONCERNING PRICE AND COMPETITION
11.21 The principal criticism made about control of parallel importation of
computer programs is that such controls allegedly allow
unfairly, to charge higher prices in Australia than in other territories
(principally the United States). In a
broader sense, it is also argued that,
irrespective of demonstrated price differentials, the provisions are
anti-competitive, and
that this has an adverse effect in the long term on
employment and the economy generally. These criticisms are discussed in turn
below. In preparing the final report the Committee has had the opportunity to
consider papers prepared by the Department of Industry
Technology and Regional
Development (DITARD) and Treasury which commented on the Prices Surveillance
Authority’s (PSA) report
into prices of computer software and which were
made available to the Committee.
Price of computer programs
11.22 Those in favour of allowing parallel importation argue that parallel
importation will lead to lower prices in Australia for
computer programs. In the
Committee’s opinion this argument relies on the premise that prices of
software are presently unacceptably
high in Australia.
The PSA’s consideration of prices
11.23 In its interim report the PSA noted that at the commencement of its
inquiry the major industry associations conceded a price
differential “of
around 30 percent with USA software”. However, because of the numerous
price comparisons presented throughout
its inquiry, the PSA conducted its own
more comprehensive comparison of advertised prices. For this study it examined
of 33 of the highest selling PC business computer program packages
over a 37 month period from July 1989 to July 1992. The result
of this survey
was a finding that Australian prices of computer programs were consistently
higher than those in the USA. The average
price differential for that period was
11.24 In preparing its final report, the PSA gave the computer industry an
opportunity to respond to its findings in its interim report
and to comment on
its methodology. In response to disagreement over its methodology, the PSA
concluded that the principal conclusion
that Australian computer program prices
have been persistently and substantially higher than in the USA was not
dependent on the
methodology used to analyse the raw data. The PSA’s
report also addressed concerns expressed by the industry regarding the
variability of data, the value of spot or long term comparisons, the veracity of
its survey results, relative movements in nominal
prices and whether taxes
should be included in the surveyed prices.
Submissions to the Committee
11.25 As acknowledged by the Committee in the Draft Report, the evidence
presented to the Committee in relation to prices varied (paragraph
Dataflow maintained that computer program prices in Australia are lower than in
other countries but submissions from Apple,
Autodesk, Lotus, Microsoft and
Roland expressly or implicitly acknowledged that prices are higher in Australia
than in the United
11.26 In fact, Microsoft and Lotus presented reasons why prices were higher
in Australia. Microsoft identified the following factors
as contributing to
higher prices (p. 16, paragraph 5.6.8):
• freight and other charges represent a ten percent (10%) add on cost
to all three levels of the distributing channel in Australia—ie,
suppliers, distributors and outlets;
• cost of support per copy in Australia is higher than in the
USA—due to the greater geographic area of support to be provided;
• cost of hardware in Australia is more expensive than in the US;
• telephone charges and costs in Australia are again higher than in the
• the essential mobility of the industry necessitates the use of
company cars for sales representatives and executives in both
Australia. However again the costs of cars in general and on-road and running
costs is higher in Australia just as salary
and ‘salary-on’ costs
are lower in the US;
• office rent is higher in Australia;
• the size of the market is substantially smaller in Australia than in
the USA leading to an absence of economies of scale in
Australia; and
• warehousing is necessary in Australia to ensure continued
availability of stock with minimum delays.
11.27 The submission by Lotus attached a background paper prepared by the
Business Software Association of Australia (BSAA) entitled
Software Pricing
in Australia and Copyright Protection for Exclusive Importation
out many similar reasons to those given by Microsoft for higher computer program
prices in Australia, such as:
• Product adaptation and localisation, eg, modifications to spelling
check dictionaries, and changing US date/time systems to
• Add–Ins and specific changes—additional program utilities
or options which are included in the product for the
Australian market but not
in the product sold on the US market;
• The cost of doing business in Australia—costs of hardware,
airline tickets, phone calls and company cars are higher in
• Economies of scale—the US market is 250 million with 50 million
users of PCs, compared with the Australian market of
17 million with 2 million
•Supporting local distributors and dealers. Costs here include:
– Establishing local Australian offices with trained technical and
management staff;
– Production and distribution of “course ware” for training
– Distribution of free pre-launch copies for familiarisation and
–Employing specialist staff to support dealers; and
–Training trainers who train users.
•Indirect support is also provided by:
–demonstrating products at exhibitions;
–producing and distributing information brochures;
–publishing newsletters and technical bulletins;
–advertising and publicity campaigns;
–supporting user training; and
–supporting local user groups.
In addition, the BSAA submitted that comparisons between the recommended
retail price of computer programs in Australia and heavily
discounted prices in
the US are invalid, especially given that many of the low prices in the US are
of the “loss leader”
term, even in the US market. The comparison in the paper between Australian and
recommended retail prices suggests that while in some cases computer programs
may be marginally cheaper in Australia typically the
price differential is
between 20% and 30% (Australian prices being higher).
11.28 The BSAA paper concluded that computer program prices in Australia are
not substantially or inordinately higher than in other
countries, in particular
the US, when fair comparisons are made and that any price differentials that do
exist can be accounted for
in differences in product specifications including
adaptation to Australian conditions, add–ins (or additional features) and
differences in the market.
11.29 It is apparent to the Committee that even if it is accepted that prices
are higher in Australia than the US, this is a situation
which is not peculiar
to Australia alone. Prices are in fact higher outside the US in a number of
other countries, such as the UK.
Moreover, the submission from the AIAA to the
Committee following the Draft Report and the paper prepared by DITARD both
that prices of legitimately produced software are lower in Australia
than in many, or all, territories outside North America.
11.30 In addition, submissions following the Draft Report, from Dataflow and
the AIAA and the DITARD paper asserted that software
prices are subject to a
downward trend. According to DITARD and the AIIA, this trend was in train before
the PSA began its inquiry,
and is indicated by the PSA’s own data. A study
conducted by Factotum (May 1993) which was commissioned by the AIIA and which
aimed to replicate, for the March 1993 quarter, the methodology adopted by the
PSA for the 1992 March quarter found that (p. 2):
For the constant set of nineteen products tracked by the PSA over 37 months,
the street price differential in Australia at current
exchange rates is just 3.7
per cent above the US price for the same bundle; the UK price is 9.7 per cent
higher than the US.
— Removing the effect of the exchange rate movements means the
Australian differential is now 14.8 per cent higher than the
US; the UK price is
33 per cent higher than the US.
Factotum reached the conclusion that (p. 7):
. . . there is ample evidence that prices of computer software in Australia
have fallen dramatically over the past twelve months [ie.
1992–1993].
Heightened competition between suppliers means there are a wide variety of ways
in which consumers can acquire
software at prices substantially lower than those
which prevailed at the time the PSA conducted the bulk of its research.
short, through a variety of means, consumers are able to purchase a wide range
of software applications at prices that are at least
40 per cent
the current best street price
. Moreover, this trend is worldwide and, in the
absence of a dramatic change in industry concentration, seems likely to
Dataflow stated in their submission that the price of their three leading
software packages had fallen in price over 1991–August
1993 by 25%.
11.31 Of perhaps even more significance is that a fall in prices since the
PSA’s report seems to have been acknowledged by the
PSA itself. In
Treasury’s comments on the PSA’s final report reference is made to
the PSA’s “Price Probe”
Issue No. 16 of June 1993 (p. 11),
where the PSA stated that the price differential had narrowed and was currently
somewhere in the
order of 20%.
11.32 From the information available to the Committee, it seems that software
prices have been, and perhaps still are, subject to
a downward trend. Some of
the reasons given for this trend include that it has resulted from the
PSA’s inquiry, that the market
is becoming more competitive, that the
distribution mechanism has become more efficient which has led to lower prices
and that software
is now more widely available through large retail outlets such
as K–Mart, Myers, Harvey Norman and newsagents. The Committee
is not able
to weigh up the validity of these reasons but, whether or not they are valid, it
is clear to the Committee that the prices
of computer programs in Australia are
not in its view
unacceptably
high, even if they are higher than in the
11.33 A prediction that allowing parallel importation would necessarily
result in further lowering of prices of legitimate software
in Australia than in
other countries remains doubtful, given the existence of numerous other factors
which may affect prices such
as changing industry structures. This point was
made by the AIAA. A prediction about the extent to which prices would fall if
importation was allowed remains speculative, as acknowledged by the
then majority of the Committee in its Draft Report (paragraph
11.34 However, there are
other aspects of this trend in prices
which need to be considered. First, whether the trend indicates a competitive
environment despite
the existence of the parallel importation provisions and
second whether it affects the PSA’s predictions about the benefits
would arise if parallel importation were allowed.
Competition
11.35 Some of those in favour of allowing parallel importation (such as
Treasury) argue that the real issue is not whether a fall
in prices will result,
but whether allowing parallel importation will result in a more competitive
market environment. Those who
believe that a more competitive environment would
result assume that this would lead in turn to benefits for employment and the
generally. Again, such arguments rest on assumption—in this case
that the market is presently anti-competitive. In Treasury’s
The recent history of microeconomic reform in Australia clearly shows that
opening up the domestic market to increased competition,
particularly from
overseas, provides tangible and early benefits to consumers in terms of lower
prices and better quality and services
eg. telephone charges and air fares.
There is no reason to assume the computer software industry is so unique that
similar benefits
would not flow to the economy and consumers if the current
importation provisions were removed.
In the Committee’s opinion, Treasury’s assumption that the
deregulation of other areas such as telephone and airline services
useful guide for what may occur if parallel importation of computer programs was
allowed is questionable. It is interesting
to note that the PSA conducted
separate inquiries into the effect of parallel importation restrictions industry
by industry and reached
separate conclusions in respect of each industry The PSA
stressed this aspect of its inquiries in its final report commenting (p.
Some issues and related explanatory hypotheses may have been canvassed in
previous inquiries, [ie. inquiries into books and sound
recordings] but each is
considered in the context of the particular industry or market that is the
subject of the inquiry.
It appears to be recognised that the effects of such controls on each
industry are different and that common assumptions and conclusions
11.36 Treasury’s view that allowing parallel importation would result
in a more competitive environment and consequential benefits
for the economy has
also been questioned by others. DITARD argued that there is already a trend
towards a more competitive market,
which has occurred without allowing parallel
importation. In its paper DITARD states as follows (pp. 7–8):
Close sectoral examination reveals that the Australian distribution channels
for software are undergoing structural change, moving
towards a highly
competitive sector . . . Briefly, the . . . restructuring reflects the
availability of software via direct mail,
the availability of pre loaded
software/hardware through local retail outlets and established local computer
ware vendors, and the
availability of bulk software packages that provide
significant discounts to consumers compared to single unit purchasing.
Other submissions in response to the Draft Report, such as those from AIIA
and Oracle, similarly argued that the industry is already
very competitive.
11.37 To address the argument that the local industry is already competitive,
Treasury contended that if this is already the case
then parallel importation
would not be a significant threat and should be allowed anyway. While, the
Committee acknowledges that
in a competitive market allowing parallel
importation might not threaten the computer industry, it is apparent to the
Committee that
this view ignores the potential impact on copyright owners that
the importation of pirate copies would have. The view of the Committee
on balance this risk is not justifiable where the result would only confer a
minimum benefit on the consumer.
Direct mail order—importation for personal
11.38 The practice identified by DITARD where US mail order companies have
advertised in Australian and UK computer magazines the
availability of computer
software by direct mail not only indicates possible competition in the market,
but a trend of circumvention
of the parallel importation provisions. The current
operation of the Act allows private individuals to purchase software (ie
or manuals) directly through the mail without infringing ss.37 or 38
because such individuals could not be regarded as “importers”
persons dealing commercially in such articles). Equally, foreign mail order
companies would not appear to be caught by the operation
of s.38 which
contemplates an identifiable “importer”. The Draft Report (paragraph
11.10) noted Apple’s concern
that the provisions in enabling orders for
personal use could be abused by unscrupulous traders and that certain traders
might endorse
all their documentation in such a way so as to circumvent the
provisions. Apple argued that the likelihood of such practices being
pursued was
higher because of the higher unit price for most computer programs than for
books. The PSA noted the existence of such
operations in its interim report and
the Committee noted in the Draft Report the various submissions which urged
changes to the Act
to make such advertising illegal (paragraph 11.11). In its
submission Infomagic suggested a further extension to the operation of
(i) so that it becomes an offence to advertise the direct mail order of
products from overseas in magazines and newspapers published
in Australia;
(ii) so that a person cannot knowingly take delivery of imported software
packages which he or she does not intend either to use themselves
or deliver to
the authorised distributor.
Microsoft suggested that s.133A should be amended so that Australian
publications are forbidden to carry advertisements for direct
services for computer program sales by overseas companies. Microsoft also
provided the Committee, on an “in-confidence”
basis, with an outline
of a number of schemes and business practices which could be adopted to avoid
the operation of the parallel
importation provisions.
11.39 In the Draft Report the Committee noted these suggestions and indicated
they had previously been considered in the preparation
of the Committee’s
1988 report and recommendations. Since the Draft Report the Committee has also
considered the impact of
technology in the area of direct mail ordering. It
notes that increasingly consumers will have access to international electronic
means of communication, including electronic mail. Users of these services will
have access to both national and international electronic
bulletin board
services which may well carry advertisements for the sale of computer programs.
Domestic legislation to ban such advertising
in foreign services would be
ineffective.
11.40 It is conceivable that these electronic services could increasingly
become the preferred means for advertising and supplying
at least some types of
computer programs. Provided such purchases are for personal use and not for a
commercial purpose so as to
conflict with the importation provisions the
Committee sees no reason why the Act should be amended to make it more difficult
consumers to learn about and purchase new computer programs from any
legitimate source, wherever it may be located. However, the
acknowledges that if this form of “electronic shopping” does become
a significant way in which consumers obtain
their computer programs it could
have a considerable impact on the effectiveness of the importation provisions as
a means by which
computer programs. Nonetheless, having regard to the foregoing discussion
the views expressed in the submissions referred to above, the Committee is of
the view that it should not recommend any changes
to the Act to regulate the
advertising (electronic or otherwise) of direct mail order services.
Regulation of prices and competition by other
legislation
11.41 The Committee acknowledges that there may be circumstances in which
control over parallel importation could be exercised in
an anti-competitive
manner and which may breach the provisions of the
Trade Practices Act
. Indeed, the Trade Practices Commission’s background paper
Application of the
Trade Practices Act
to Intellectual Property
1991) states that there are many examples from Europe and the US which indicate
that the potential for anti-competitive conduct
in relation to intellectual
property exists (p. 3, paragraph 1.3). However, no evidence of this sort
has been presented to the Committee
in relation to computer software. In any
event, the Committee does not think that such a possibility would justify the
the control over parallel importation, which provides the basis of
international marketing of copyright-based goods. If there are
instances in
which this control is exercised anti-competitively, the remedies should be those
available in legislation which implements
competition policy.
11.42 One member of the Committee (previously a member of the majority in the
Draft Report) does not agree with the views contained
in paragraph 11.41 above.
That member believes that there are insufficient remedies available to prohibit
anti-competitive behaviour
by the exclusive licensee of copyright licences.
While parallel importation sanctions remain, the issue of addressing
anti-competitive
behaviour must be raised in the
Trade Practices Act
that protection of the exclusive licence granted in Australia does not have the
effect of granting that licensee any economic
rights over and above market based
performance criteria. The grant of an exclusive licence effectively prohibits
competition, therefore
incentives must apply to require that licensee to perform
adequately by way of service, availability of product, correction of faults
tailoring product to the needs of the local market.
11.43 The Committee considers that the mere existence of the control over
parallel importation, or any other property rights such
as those over real
property, does not of itself contravene competition policy. As pointed out by
the AIIA, abuse of market power
in relation to other property rights is dealt
with by deterrents such as fines, rather than by expropriation or forfeiture of
property. In relation to the control over parallel importation, the PSA has
proposed forfeiture of this control for
evidence of abuse of market power by any one of them.
11.44 There may also be other avenues of response to potentially
anti-competitive conduct, such as consumer/user demands. One example
cited by Treasury, was the decision by Microsoft after pressure from the PSA and
users, to unbundle the cost of technical
support and reduce the recommended
retail price of products to a level commensurate with the loss of technical
support. As reported
by Treasury, initially Microsoft was proposing to unbundle
technical support but maintain recommended retail prices at existing levels.
the Committee’s opinion, even if the PSA’s “pressure”
was enhanced by threat of repeal of the importation
provisions, the response by
Microsoft to pressure from users would seem to indicate a competitive
11.45 It should also be noted that procedures exist for the declaration of
companies under the
Prices Surveillance Act 1983
. Once a company is
declared by the Minister responsible,
has the effect that the company must
notify the PSA where it proposes to increase the price of goods or services
it provides. A penalty of $10 000 may be incurred for failure to comply with
this requirement. If the PSA is notified of such a proposal
it can make
recommendations agreeing or not agreeing with the proposal to increase price or
it can propose some variation of the
price increase proposed. However, the PSA
has no power to enforce its recommendations, though the Committee understands
is generally a 100% compliance rate with the PSA‘s
recommendations.
11.46 As the Committee was finalising this report, the Assistant Treasurer,
the Hon George Gear MP, announced on 8 November 1994,
that in 1995 the Prices
Surveillance Authority would be merged with the Trade Practices Commission to
form a new body, the Australian
Competition Commission (ACC). The Assistant
Treasurer’s press statement referred to the introduction of a new prices
regime to be administered by the ACC. This is a three-tiered approach
to prices surveillance including price surveillance, similar
to the existing
declaration system, formal price monitoring (where the Minister will have the
power to direct the ACC to declare
a firm for formal price monitoring and the
declared firm will then be required to provide the ACC with cost and price data
intervals) and informal price monitoring. As regards informal price
monitoring the Assistant Treasurer’s announcement indicated
that this may
apply to CDs and computer software. In the Committee’s view the
availability of such price monitoring mechanisms
will represent a viable
alternative option to use of the parallel importation provisions to control
competition and prices.
ARGUMENTS CONCERNING THE ECONOMY, EMPLOYMENT AND
LOCAL INDUSTRY
11.47 Those in favour of allowing parallel importation argue that greater
competition and/or lower software prices will result in
long term benefits to
employment and the economy. Treasury stated (pp. 1 and 3):
If the price of local software fell . . . the overall demand for computer
software is likely to grow, with consequent expansion of
production and
employment opportunities in local manufacturing and distribution . . . there is
likely to also be a change in the
structure of this sector, with new
distributors parallel importing and thereby expanding employment and
11.48 In its Draft Report, the then majority of the Committee said that it
regarded the effect of prices on both employment and Australia’s
international competitiveness as the two most important considerations to be
weighed against the copyright owners’ rights in
respect of parallel
importation (paragraph 11.40). The then majority of the Committee attached
“considerable importance”
to the findings of the National Institute
of Economics and Industry Research (NIEIR) engaged by the PSA to determine the
macro-economic
consequences of current pricing practices engaged in by the
computer industry and regarded the NIEIR finding that “current
impact negatively on Australia’s macro-economic performance” as
highly significant.
11.49 The predictions of the NIEIR report have been the subject of criticism,
and their accuracy and persuasiveness should be assessed
in the light of those
criticisms. The Committee think there is force in the arguments by the AIIA and
DITARD that the NIEIR findings
are flawed because they are based on unrealistic
assumptions, such as a one-off 20% reduction in the price of imported software,
and because they do not take into account factors outside the model (such as
business investment and employment and border control
costs associated with
parallel importation). The AIAA commissioned a report from Dr Larry Cook who
reviewed the NIEIR report and
analysed its results. Dr Cook examined the
calculations and modelling used in that report and indicated difficulty in using
adopted, concluding that (p. 5):
The IMP model [the model used by NIEIR] raises more questions than it
answers. . . Until better documentation and explanation is available
for the IMP
model, results and reports based on that model should be treated with extreme
11.50 In its most recent submission the AIAA repeated its criticism of the
NIEIR report and the PSA’s reliance on it which it
had made to the PSA
after the release of its interim report. The Committee is in agreement with the
AIAA’s view that (p. 7):
. . . [the] one thing that is clear from the PSA inquiry is the absence of
reliable data on the software industry, especially about
such factors such as
price and income elasticities of demand, and the significance of software as an
input to other industries.
It is these inadequacies which have led the Committee to doubt the validity
of the PSA’s findings and its recommendations and
not to rely on the NIEIR
report as a justification for allowing parallel importation.
11.51 As mentioned, DITARD and Treasury also indicated a common reservation
with the NIEIR report to the PSA on the basis that in
general economic models
used to estimate outcomes cannot be regarded as intrinsically reliable. DITARD
referred to (p. 2)
. . . common reservations about the ability of macro-economic models to match
estimates with actual outcomes . . .
11.52 Treasury, who supported removal of parallel importation controls, also
accepted that the NIEIR model may overstate the possible
benefits of parallel
importation and that (p. 3):
The initial fall in the price of packaged software may not be of the
magnitude modelled.
Treasury acknowledged that it is difficult to forecast the net employment
gain due to the two offsetting patterns in employment predicted
by the NIEIR,
and also acknowledged that initial employment losses would be likely if parallel
importation was allowed, but argued
that (p. 3):
. . . on a priori grounds, a positive longer term effect on employment is
likely to occur through productivity improvements.
DITARD, on the other hand, argued that net employment losses in the
distribution sector resulting from parallel importation would
substantial.
11.53 Treasury’s predictions appear to be based on the results of
implementing policies to increase competition in other areas
such as telephone
services and airfares. The Committee does not share Treasury’s confidence
that such comparisons are sound,
and that there are no relevant differences
between deregulation of other industries and allowing parallel importation of
11.54 Finally, the Committee notes that the LCA also expressed reservations
them. The LCA along with
Dr Cook noted the limited amount of detail published by the PSA about the NIEIR
report and that the findings
of the NIEIR were predicated on the PSA’s
conclusion that higher prices of software in Australia result, to a substantial
from the control on parallel importation.
11.55 While the Committee does not presume to have economic expertise in
relation to the possible effects of parallel importation
and relies on the
opinion of those more qualified in these matters, the Committee is concerned
that the evidence concerning prices
and effect on the economy if parallel
importation was allowed is not conclusive and that the principal report
commissioned by the
PSA has been subject to widespread criticism. These concerns
convince the Committee that the PSA’s findings, first released
interim report which is now over two years old, cannot be accepted and that
parallel importation should not be allowed on
the basis of that report.
11.56 As regards possible effects on employment, it is clear to the Committee
that even those in favour of allowing parallel importation
acknowledge that
there would be employment losses in the short term. Opinions differ as to the
extent and duration of these employment
losses, and the extent (if any) to which
they would be off-set by employment gains in the longer term. Given this. the
has decided not to recommend a change in the law which most
commentators seem to acknowledge would result in employment losses, with
compensating gains being speculative and disputed.
11.57 In considering a range of possible effects on the economy of allowing
parallel importation, the Committee’s attention
was also drawn to the
effect on the local industry. In the Draft Report the Committee referred to this
issue in paragraphs 11.14–11.15.
The Committee is of the view that as with
employment, it is difficult to predict the consequences for local industry.
Certainly unreserved
reliance cannot be placed on the PSA’s views that
local producers will face little direct competition from imported software.
Committee notes that the LCA took issue with the PSA’s description of the
local industry as a “niche market”
and questioned the ability of the
local industry to withstand parallel imports (where prices would be falling as
predicted by the
PSA). It was also suggested that if parallel importation were
allowed then many of the major suppliers of computer programs would
uneconomical to introduce and support the range of products that they presently
provide. This in turn would have an adverse
effect on those Australian
businesses that create interoperable programs. While the Committee accepts that
this is a possible effect
of allowing parallel importation it notes that in this
regard it is important to distinguish the market for the programs, particularly
in terms of the personal and small business market, mini and medium business
market, and large scale part of the market.
11.58 Finally, mention should be made of the effect allowing parallel
importation may have in discouraging new overseas producers
from establishing a
presence in Australia. Disincentive to invest in research and development in
Australia was a concern raised in
a number of submissions received by the
Committee following the Draft Report, including those from the AIIA, CBEMA and
the LCA. DITARD’s
paper also referred to this issue indicating that the
intellectual property regime of Australia (including controls on parallel
importation)
was a major factor in decisions taken by multinational companies to
locate software development projects in Australia. While the
recognises that Australia’s intellectual property regime is extremely
effective in protecting Australia’s creators
and investors and would
continue to offer protection even if controls over parallel importation were
relaxed, the Committee considers
that loss of control over parallel importation
would be a disincentive to investment by overseas producers in establishing a
in Australia. This would have flow-on effects on the local industry,
including less investment in research and development.
AVAILABILITY
11.59 The availability of software has been a peripheral issue in the debate
Draft Report were the
submissions from Autodesk, Dataflow, Lotus, Microsoft and Mindscape in which all
companies indicated that they
carried a full range of computer programs and that
availability was not a problem. Such delays as did occur from time to time, in
relation to new product coming on to the market, were attributed to the need to
test programs for bugs and to build up sufficient
stocks. The Committee was also
told that old computer programs were sometimes removed from the market in
anticipation of the arrival
of upgraded versions.
11.60 Microsoft’s submission made the Committee aware that many
computer companies market their computer programs on the basis
that, from time
to time, certain programs are unavailable. This not being due to a lack of
commitment to the Australian market, but
by a desire to provide the latest
versions to the market as soon as possible following their release overseas.
Accordingly, superseded
versions are removed from the market prior to the
release of the latest enhancement.
11.61 The Draft Report also referred to the PSA’s findings with respect
to availability in its interim and final reports. In
the interim report the PSA
noted that the initial complaints it received suggested there were availability
problems in respect of
both existing products and new releases of computer
programs. However, it concluded that the evidence presented to the inquiry
demonstrated
that overall availability was not a problem, although isolated
instances did arise. In response to the PSA’s observation concerning
availability, the AIIA submitted that repeal of the importation provisions would
threaten the viability of the industry with the
result that end users would
ultimately be worse off because of higher prices and reduced availability.
11.62 In Chapter 9 of its final report the PSA considered the effect of
repeal of the importation provisions on the domestic computer
program industry
and made reference to the issue of availability of software. The PSA stated (p.
During the preparation of the Interim Report the Authority believed that
availability of software was not generally a problem. However,
this view was
formed on the basis of evidence regarding the availability of PC software.
Subsequent evidence presented by the Australian
Share/Guide Ltd suggests that
product availability may be restricted for mid-range and mainframe software
The PSA concluded that unless Australian developers and business in general
had timely access to a wide range of new products and
releases, their cost
efficiency and hence Australia’s international competitiveness would fall.
The PSA believed that repeal
of the importation provisions should overcome this
11.63 As stated by the PSA, the evidence from the Australian Share/Guide Ltd
was suggestive only and, as far as the Committee is aware,
it was the only
evidence presented to the PSA on this issue following the interim report. For
these two reasons, the evidence concerning
availability seems of limited value
and tends to indicate more that availability is not a problem rather than the
reverse. By contrast,
the Committee views the argument, made by CBEMA in its
submission on the Draft Report, that allowing parallel importation may lead
diminished availability of products because of less incentive to create a market
for a new product in an environment where others
can free-ride on that
investment, as a far more weighty concern.
11.64 As already mentioned at the beginning of this Chapter at paragraph
11.08, the Committee considered the question of availability
of copyright
materials in 1988 and in order to address concerns voiced by software users
software products in Australia,
recommended that where such products were not available they be able to be
imported to without contravening
the parallel importation provisions. The
Committee noted the views of the PC Users Group Inc that products may be
unavailable in
Australia because for instance, the exclusive agent does not want
to market a new product released overseas in Australia and instead
stocks in Australia (1988 Report—paragraph 171(3)). In commenting on its
recommendation the Committee said (paragraph
. . . the Committee’s recommendations that importation be allowed where
there is either a specific order or where the article
sought to be imported is
unavailable in Australia . . . do offer solutions to the major problems raised
by the software users. The
range an quantity of imported software products
available to the Australian consumer will increase. On the other hand, the
and marketing activities of the licensed importers will not be
substantially affected because the demand for imported software products
need to be altered to meet Australian conditions will remain unaffected . . .
11.65 The Committee has recalled its discussion in the 1988 Report concerning
availability as it regards the comments it made then
as still being pertinent.
The Committee has not made any recommendation in this report to relax the
operation of the importation
provisions to allow limited instances of parallel
importation of computer programs to meet consumer demands, but it is of the view
that further consideration could be given to such an option. It notes that
following its 1988 Report and the PSA’s inquiry
into the prices of books
in 1989 the Government amended the importation provisions as they apply to books
(s.44A). The Committee understands
that these provisions are working well.
TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.66 There were differing views in the submissions and papers presented to
the Committee about the desirability of bundling the cost
of technical support
with the cost of software. The Committee also received submissions concerning
the quality of existing customer
service from both exclusive licensees and
parallel importers. These submissions and views were outlined in the Draft
Report at paragraphs
11.45–11.53.
11.67 In their submissions to the Committee prior to the Draft Report,
Autodesk and Lotus both distinguished computer programs from
other copyright
materials, such as books and records, on the basis that additional expenditure
was required on an ongoing basis in
relation to computer programs to enable the
provision of training and support and educational services. In its submission to
Committee, Microsoft argued that the importation provisions were necessary
to enable distributors to provide users with essential
support and upgrade
paths. Sun Microsystems commented that the existing provisions helped prevent
the importation of pirate copies
of computer programs, ensured customers were
provided with a product support system, enabled the continuing provision of
avoided virus infection by computer programs from unauthorised sources
and enabled the provision of support for local organisations.
submitted that the provisions enabled it to provide user training, support,
distribution of its computer programs and
advertising.
11.68 While acknowledging that in some cases computer program prices would
fall in the short term, Microsoft submitted that if computer
programs were able
to be freely imported directly from the United States, in the long term support
for imported products would be
reduced. Microsoft also claimed that there would
be no opportunities for computer programs to be tailored in response to the
of the Australian consumer, there would be no technology transfer between
the USA and Australia and more directly the removal of
the provisions would
affect revenue generated in Australia as well as the employment and skill
development of Australians.
Australian Consumers’ Association
11.69 The submission from the ACA focused on the requirements of users of
computer programs.
The ACA’s submission classed consumers of
computer programs into two main categories—non-sophisticated beginners and
computer-literate
users. In respect of computer-literate users it argued that
these consumers did not benefit from the level of support currently
available. However, consumers in the non-sophisticated beginner category
depended to a large degree on the provision of back-up services
by experts.
11.70 The ACA noted that back-up service for computer programs could be
divided into two different categories; repair or debugging
and enhancements
(up-grading). The ACA submitted that repair or debugging service gave rise to
the same sorts of issues for consumers
of computer programs as those facing
purchasers of other consumer goods such as cars and electrical appliances and
that consumers
of computer programs are similarly protected as other consumers
Trade Practices Act
and other consumer legislation. On
this analysis the ACA submitted the issue unique to computer programs concerned
“enhancements”.
It claimed that in effect importers were using the
Act to enforce a built-in prepayment for after-sales services. The question for
consumers was what was the value of such a service.
11.71 The ACA’s submission identified the following inadequacies in the
service provided:
•suppliers’ lack of knowledge;
•lack of interest in providing assistance;
•inadequate demonstration at point of sale; and
•unhelpful manuals.
It also claimed that correspondence that it received indicated that rather
than sophisticated users subsidising entry level consumers,
consumers of varying
levels of sophistication were subsidising the Australian licensees.
11.72 Having regard to these considerations the ACA suggested that ideally
consumers should be able to tailor their level of support
to meet their needs
and their capacity to pay. Furthermore, consumers should have the option of
trading off lower purchase prices
by foregoing upgrading processes. Accordingly,
the ACA recommended that changes should be implemented to make after-sales
involvement
optional (p. 5):
. . . along lines already in place in other industries, such as extended
warranties. Risking expensive repairs could thus become a
regular decision with
renewable warranties being analogous to insurance.
On this approach enhancements would be provided on the basis of the
consumer’s needs.
11.73 The ACA commented that it was uncertain how many consumers benefit
from, or wish to stay at, the leading edge of available technology.
noted that such choices (computer programs at different prices with and without
support) were available in the US market.
This did not appear to have any side
effects in innovation and development. Accordingly, the ACA argued that the most
appropriate
structure of protection in the computer program industry was a
mixture of open competition between distributors and direct subsidies
computer program manufacturers and developers.
PSA’s consideration of the issue
11.74 In its interim report the PSA expressed concern at the efficiency
implications of including technical support as a component
of the purchase price
of packaged computer programs for personal computers. It noted that those users
who require technical support
infrequently or not at all are subsidising those
who frequently use technical support facilities. The efficiency effects
by the PSA were:
• there may be excess demand for technical support because it is
perceived to be free; and
•supply is likely to be excessive in response to excessive demands.
In its final report the PSA stated that, while it believed that
“bundling” (ie, the practice of the joint provision of
program with an offer of technical support) was undesirable, it also accepted
the AIIA’s contention that a decision
by a supplier to unbundle is a
commercial one based on the product, the experience of users and competitive
forces, rather than regulatory
mandate. For this reason it expressed a
preference that this should be encouraged by exposing the market to greater
competitive pressure
such as would occur by repealing the importation
provisions.
Product support by parallel importers
11.75 A number of advocates favouring the retention of ss.37 and 38 claimed
that parallel importers do not provide any support on
the products that they
sell. Computermate disputed this claim. Computermate noted that a seller’s
obligations to the buyer
are clearly defined in the
Trade Practices Act 1974
which was endorsed by the comments of the ACA. Computermate also submitted
that it was unaware of any complaints concerning warranty
matters as all
products sold by it are covered by a warranty from the overseas supplier through
Computermate. It was also claimed
that in some circumstances the warranty period
provided by the parallel importer was longer than that offered by the exclusive
Some of the views expressed by Computermate were echoed in a letter to
the Prime Minister from Comprepair which was referred to the
Comprepair claimed that the back-up service it had received from parallel
importers was superior to that provided by the
major companies.
Impact of “unbundling” support
11.76 The Committee has not formed any firm view on the merits or demerits of
bundling technical support with software sales. The
Committee notes that the PSA
found that the bundling of support with the purchase price was not a
“universal practice”
and that moves to unbundling were occurring.
Having a possible negative consequence was Dataflow’s assertion, in its
submission to the Committee after the Draft Report, that some software
publishers and distributors were (p. 2):
. . . imposing very significant charges on providing service to the consumer
as a result of unbundling service and software costs.
The Committee is not certain upon which consumers such costs are being
imposed, but the Committee is aware that licensed distributors
do charge for
service where a client had not made their initial purchase from them. This
situation should be contrasted with that
of a purchasing client. In any event,
it is the Committee’s view that the question of technical support is not a
matter which
is properly dealt with by the removal of parallel importation
provisions. If forms of marketing are occurring which contravene competition
policy, then the proper area of recourse is competition law.
11.77 One member of the Committee (previously a member of the majority in the
Draft Report) believes that the provision of technical
support, service and
backup should be a fundamental obligation of the vendor if the vendor has the
protection of an exclusive licence
protected by parallel importation sanctions.
Competition law in Australia has not, in this member’s opinion, yet proved
to address the requirements of such behaviour in the computer market
and as such, such issues should be addressed in competition
law to ensure full
service and technical support is available with the sale of the product.
Terminology
11.78 The issue of piracy was examined by the Committee in the Draft Report
in paragraphs 11.61–11.65. At the outset the Committee
clarified its use
of the term “piracy” by stating (paragraph 11.61):
Put simply, piracy is the copying of copyright materials for commercial
purposes knowing the copying to be an infringement, or the
commercial dealing
with such copies knowing them to be such. These are criminal offences.
Unauthorised copying by private individuals
or organisations for their own use
that amounts to an infringement is not, however, a criminal offence and cannot
be considered as
“piracy” in the sense of the offences just referred
to. That is, piracy does not extend to copying for internal use by
businesses or
copying by individuals for themselves, where there is no commercial element in
the activity in the sense that copies
are not sold or otherwise dealt with
commercially or otherwise distributed widely. Whether own-use copying is
authorised or, alternatively,
infringes copyright will of course depend on the
licence agreement between the user and the copyright owner or his or her
licensee. In this regard the Committee notes that its use of the term
“piracy” is somewhat different to that used by
the PSA in its
(The term piracy as used by the PSA was not limited to copying for commercial
purposes but included “user copying”—Interim
Report, p.29,
paragraph 2.12).
11.79 The Committee also defined “counterfeiting” stating
(paragraph 11.62):
The Committee understands that counterfeiting is the unauthorised manufacture
of copies of copyright materials which are made to look
like the originals as
far as is technically possible. This includes all aspects of presentation of the
product, manuals, packaging
etc. It is to be expected that counterfeiting
activities would be undertaken for commercial gain and, as such, would come
the concept of piracy as defined above. It is also conceivable that
individuals may make own-use counterfeit copies.
11.80 The use of these terms by the Committee in this final report has not
changed. However, it is worth noting, as did the PSA in
its interim and final
reports, that the sort of “piracy” that the Committee’s
discussion concerns is the sort that
can be controlled by the importation
provisions in ss.37, 38 or 135 of the Act. Obviously, unauthorised copies of
computer programs
made in Australia, even if dealt with commercially within
Australia, will not be affected by the importation provisions. It should
noted that the Committee’s discussion focuses on the importation for
commercial dealing of copies of computer programs
that have been reproduced
without the consent of the copyright owner in the country of origin. Copies of
computer programs made with
the consent of the copyright owner in the country of
manufacture and subsequently imported into Australia without the consent of
nominated local distributor do not fall within the accepted meaning of
“pirate goods” and are not the focus of the
Committee’s
discussion in this part of the chapter. The latter type of imported goods are
“parallel imports”, not
“pirate import goods”.
Importation of pirate products
11.81 It appears to the Committee that it is commonly accepted that the
repeal of the importation provisions, even if limited to certain
would increase the chance that some imported material would be pirated product.
It also appears to be agreed that detection
of this pirate product by customs
authorities and copyright owners and their distributors is already difficult and
could be exacerbated
if the parallel importation provisions were repealed.
Indeed the majority of the Committee in the Draft Report referred to piracy
“real threat” in paragraph 11.60. The PSA also identified piracy as
one of the major issues of its inquiry.
11.82 While the PSA’s discussion of piracy appeared to be primarily
concerned with the issue of copying of computer programs
by users in Australia
referred to as own-use copying (see discussion in Interim Report at p.29 and
p.103) and its impact on prices,
the PSA also identified the concern that
allowing the importation of computer programs, even legitimate product, may lead
to increased
problems with pirate imported product. In the Committee’s
view the PSA correctly identified the two key issues of concern with
imported pirate product—first, that “ . . . the sale of pirated
software directly correlates with lost revenue
and reduced economic
welfare” and second, that “. . . without protection from legitimate
parallel imports, detection
of pirate imports would be more difficult”
(Interim Report, p.155, paragraph 8.2.2). While noting these possible outcomes,
the PSA went on to conclude in its Interim Report that (p.156, paragraph
There seems little reason to expect that repeal of the importation provisions
will alter significantly the difficulty in detecting
individual pirated
Final Report
the PSA said, after acknowledging that
there were no direct remedies available to prevent the entry of pirated software
into Australia,
The Authority does not believe that repeal of the importation provisions will
lead to a flood of pirated or counterfeit products .
11.83 In contradiction to the PSA’s conclusion, the Committee’s
Draft Report referred to a number of submissions which
submitted that the repeal
of the parallel importation provisions would lead to an escalation of piracy in
Australia. Mindscape submitted
that the computer program industry is
particularly vulnerable to piracy. It noted that most of the copyright
“pirate havens”
are located in South-East Asia. Mindscape also
suggested that amendment of the importation provisions would increase the
of pirate product reaching the Australian market through mixed
shipments from overseas suppliers, thereby adding to the difficulty
of detecting
pirate product. Under the importation provisions as they presently stand, a
Australia need only show that a
particular article was not placed on the market with his or her permission to
establish that the
article is infringing. Commenting on the changes recommended
by the Committee in 1988 Mindscape said that proof would be required
imported articles were unauthorised copies. This, Mindscape submitted, may be
virtually impossible to establish in many cases.
Accordingly, Mindscape
submitted that any relaxation of the provisions would greatly increase the
likelihood of high quality pirate
products being imported into Australia.
11.84 Submissions in response to the Draft Report voiced similar concerns.
Dataflow submitted that (p. 2):
The removal of the parallel importation provisions of the
without doubt, decrease the fear that a potential pirate may have of
prosecution. Copyright owners based overseas, who look
to their exclusive
licensee to act on their behalf, will now have no-one who will be interested in
doing so if the parallel importation
provisions of the
are removed
. . . There is considerable fear of Australia being placed in the same category
as Thailand, Hong Kong and Indonesia,
in relation to the seriousness of piracy
in the eyes of an overseas publishers [sic].
11.85 A recent report in the
Australian Financial Review
(7 November
1994) echoes the fears of piracy referred to by Dataflow in its submission. The
article notes the views of Mr Ron Eckstrom
(Vice-President of the Business
Software Alliance) that (p.49):
. . . the biggest counterfeiting operations are centred in Taiwan and
mainland China, which arrange worldwide distribution for copied
manuals in packages almost identical to software companies’ own
11.86 The Committee recognises that one of the principal differences of
opinion between those in favour and those against allowing
parallel importation
is in their assessment of the level of piracy. In the Committee’s opinion
piracy should not be treated
dismissively and all possible measures should be
taken to reduce its incidence and discourage its growth. Submissions such as
from Dataflow lend considerable weight to the Committee’s view that
the threat of piracy is a principal reason why parallel
importation of computer
programs and associated manuals should not be allowed.
Border control provisions—section
11.87 Section 135 of the Act presently contains provisions that allow a
of copies of a work
where if the work had been made in Australia by the person importing it, it
would have constituted an infringement
of copyright in the work. The section
only applies to printed copies of a published literary, dramatic or musical
work. As discussed
in the Draft Report (paragraphs 11.16, 11.61–11.69) and
as mentioned above (paragraph 11.07), s.135 has been the subject of
inquiry and
recommendation by both this Committee and the PSA. The Committee recommended in
(i) section 135 be amended to cover copies, whether printed or not, of all
works and subject matter; and
(ii) section 135 be amended to empower the exclusive licensee, as well as the
owner of copyright to give a notice
11.88 Proposed amendments to s.135 have been included in the
Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994
, as a result of the conclusion of the
GATT TRIPS Agreement. These amendments are outlined in paragraphs
11.89–11.90. The Committee
is of the view that these amendments, if
passed, would not of themselves provide sufficient protection for copyright
owners against
the threat from imported pirate copies of their software.
Proposed amendments to section 135
implements the requirements of the TRIPS agreement in relation to border
enforcement provisions. Accordingly, as explained by the
Explanatory Memorandum,
this Bill will amend the Act to extend copyright-owner initiated Customs seizure
under s.135 of the Act from
application only to printed works to the
interception of unauthorised imports of all copyright materials including
artistic works,
sound recordings, computer disks, audio tapes, videotapes,
disks, films, CD ROMs and other forms of storage of copies of works, films
sound recordings. The Bill also makes it clear that the “owner” of
the copyright in copyright material includes an
exclusive licensee of the
possible for an exclusive
licensee to initiate seizure of copyright materials by
giving a notice to the customs authorities. The Committee notes that the Bill
effectively implements both of the Committee’s 1988 recommendations. The
Bill also introduces new provisions relating to seizure
11.90 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill explains the proposed changes as
follows (p. 7, paragraphs 28–30):
Article 51 of the TRIPS Agreement provides that Members shall extend border
enforcement measures to the full range of copyright material
covered by TRIPS.
There is no limitation in the TRIPS Agreement that the copyright material
referred to in Article 51 of TRIPS is
to be printed and published.
In accordance with the TRIPS provisions the amendments under clause 8 of the
Bill extend the border seizure provisions to all copyright
works whether
published or not but do so within the context of a new scheme which places the
onus on copyright owners to commence
proceedings in court for infringement of
By contrast with the existing provision under which seizure is determinative,
and which is understood to have never been utilised,
customs seizure under
amended s.135 will operate as merely a means of holding the copies pending a
decision of a court. If no proceedings
are instituted and there is no other
reason to hold the copies they will be released after the seizure period.
11.91 Although the Committee appreciates that the proposed amendments will
extend the border enforcement provisions to computer programs,
the Committee
believes that these provisions will not alter the fundamental difficulty for
product from legitimate product as it
enters Australia and notifying ACS accordingly. Reliance on s.135 if controls
over parallel
importation were to be removed would not offer a reasonable
alternative for copyright owners of computer programs. Identification
and counterfeit articles remains a very difficult practical problem which is
exacerbated if articles other than those
manufactured on behalf of Australian
were able to gather
reliable information concerning alleged importation of
pirate goods, s.135 will remain of little assistance to them. The
Committee’s
view is supported by DITARD’s paper which states (p.
The nature of the current importation provisions gives the software copyright
owners and their distribution channels control over
the delivery of their
intellectual property to the end-user. The distribution industry can verify
whether software is a legitimate
copy with relative ease . . . Parallel
importation has the potential to alter this situation significantly, as software
imported outside this informational network. Information on the
legitimacy of the imported product will no longer be contained within
distribution chain. Consequently, the commercial opportunities to sell pirated
product will expand as the risk of detection declines.
11.92 Finally the Committee notes, as did Dataflow in its submission (see
paragraph 11.84), that the removal of the parallel importation
provisions would
remove the incentive for an overseas copyright owner to appoint an exclusive
licensee in Australia. Without a local
presence such copyright owners may face
greater difficulties in detecting the importation of pirate copies of their
software and
enforcing their rights.
Conclusion and recommendations
11.93 As the preceding discussion in this chapter indicates, there are a
number of competing factors to be evaluated in any decision
concerning controls
over parallel importation. The Committee has been required to weigh up the
interests of and anticipate the future
effects on consumers of computer goods,
local producers of computer software and multinational producers of software and
their locally
appointed licensees/distributors. The broader issues of piracy of
computer software and the relationship between competition and
price within the
computer industry have also been key elements to be taken account of by the
Committee. One of the greatest difficulties
facing the Committee has been
anticipating what the future effects of allowing or not allowing parallel
importation may be and of
judging the merits of the arguments made to the
Committee as to possible consequences of adopting either course. In deciding
the restrictions on parallel importation should remain (thereby reversing
its recommendation in the Draft Report), the Committee
has taken most account of
the threat of an increase in the distribution of pirated software if parallel
importation was allowed and
the doubt cast by recent advice prepared by the
Attorney-General’s Department
on the compatibility of the
majority’s recommendation in the Draft Report (that parallel importation
be allowed from those countries
which are the main source of computer programs
used in Australia) with Australia’s obligations under the TRIPS Agreement.
downward trend in prices of computer software, which the Committee
understands had started before the PSA’s inquiry in 1992
and which is
continuing, is also a major factor that has led to the change in the
Committee’s recommendation.
11.94 On the whole the Committee does not think the justifications for
allowing parallel importation have been demonstrated with any
certainty. The claim by the PSA that prices of computer software are higher in
Australia than in the United States because
of control over parallel importation
is open to doubt, particularly given the evidence of a downward trend in prices
which has occurred
despite the provisions. Furthermore the economic predictions
in the PSA’s report have received no support in the submissions
to the Committee following the Draft Report; on the contrary its predictions
have been the subject of considerable criticism.
The Committee acknowledges that
parallel importation provisions may potentially be exercised in an
anti-competitive manner, but does
not think that this alone justifies their
repeal, particularly given the absence of evidence of instances of
anti-competitive exercise.
If there were such instances, it would be preferable
to deal with them under legislation which implements competition policy, such
Trade Practices Act 1974
. The Committee also recognises that the
benefits of allowing parallel importation may be impossible to measure in
economic terms
(and therefore are unable to be demonstrated in any conclusive
way) the Committee still holds the view that the possible detrimental
the computer software industry (ie, piracy) and the wider community (ie,
employment) of allowing parallel importation
are reason enough to retain
controls over parallel importation.
11.95 As regards the broad issue of the price of computer programs and
competition within the computer industry, one member of the
Committee is of the
view that pricing is not the major issue. That member is concerned that the
tension between competition policy
and the exclusive rights of the licensee must
be addressed so as to avoid anti-competitive conduct by the licensee, which in
view of that member of the Committee is not addressed sufficiently by the
existing provisions of the
Trade Practices Act 1974
and the various State
anti-competition laws. While agreeing that parallel importation remain
prohibited, that member of the Committee
believes that other mechanisms should
be put in place to ensure competitive performance within the market and to
ensure that licensees
adequately serve the interests of consumers by attending
to or providing, among other matters, the availability of product, a range
product, sufficient backup support, appropriate adjustments to programs to suit
the needs of the local market, regular updating
of product, reporting as to
availability and generally providing comprehensive service to customers. The
matters just listed are
indicative only of possible consumer demands and
concerns and in no way are intended to be an exhaustive list of matters that may
need to be addressed.
11.96 All members of the Committee now recommend that the restriction on
parallel importation of computer programs remain unchanged
(Recommendation
2.39(a)). The Committee also gave consideration to whether it should recommend a
further review of the parallel importation
provisions, bearing in mind any
changes in the local computer software market. Some members of the Committee
recommend such a review
in three years time, while one member (who was part of
the majority in the Draft Report ie. in favour of lifting the restrictions
parallel importation) recommends that the position be reviewed in two years
time. (Recommendation 2.39(b)).
Other issues
Computer manuals
11.97 In February and March 1990 Microsoft and Infomagic wrote to the
Attorney-General concerning possible implications of the then
Amendment Bill 1990
(the Books Bill) on the importation of computer manuals.
Copies of those letters were referred to the Committee. The Committee notes
the provisions of the Books Bill were given effect by the
which came into effect
on 23 December 1991.
11.98 It was submitted by Microsoft and Infomagic that most computer programs
are provided to users as part of a package which includes
a detailed manual
which explains to users how to get the most out of their programs and to help
them recover from errors. The manuals
are not usually sold separately from the
computer programs. Infomagic commented that one of the factors which prevents
the widespread
use of illegal copies of computer programs within Australia is
the fact that a user of an illegal copy will in most cases not have
access to a
11.99 The amendments to the Act introduced by the
provide in s.44A, among other things, that a copyright owner’s
control over importation is removed where:
(a) a book is first published outside Australia and not published in
Australia within 30 days;
(b) a book first published in Australia or published in Australia within 30
days of first publication overseas is not obtainable
from the copyright owner
for 90 days; and
(c)where a retailer receives a specific order for a single copy.
11.100 Infomagic and Microsoft submitted that:
(a) as it is the practice of some computer program distributors and
publishers not to sell manuals separately from the licence of
computer programs
it is arguable that they have never been supplied in Australia and therefore
suppliers would lose their rights
to control the importation of those
(b) the industry produces different versions of products for different
markets. Unless manuals were excluded from the amendments
various versions would
never be published in Australia, and could therefore be imported at any time;
(c) it is not possible to publish computer programs simultaneously around the
world. The publication of computer programs involves
the progressive testing of
programs in different markets until any errors are found and removed.
Simultaneous publication could result
in the delivery of product to the
Australian market that was not entirely ready.
Accordingly, Microsoft and Infomagic urged in 1990 that manuals normally
provided as part of a computer program package be excluded
from the operation of
the proposals contained in the Books Bill.
11.101 The Committee notes that the amendments to the Act introduced by the
exclude computer manuals (see s.44A(9) of
the Act). The concerns expressed above are based on the assumption that there is
in the US and other markets that manuals for computer programs may be
purchased there separately from the computer program itself.
The submissions do
not make it clear whether this is the case or not and the Committee was not
otherwise informed in the matter.
(The Committee did not receive any specific
comments on its recommendation in the Draft Report regarding computer manuals or
other comments in relation to manuals). However, on the basis that such
manuals are available on the US market the question arises
why they are not
available for separate sale in Australia. Manuals are used by computer program
developers for the purpose of reverse
engineering and the development of
interoperable products. Accordingly, the Committee recognises that the
Australian computer program
industry needs access to up-to-date manuals so that
developers can react to trends in computer program design. The Committee does
not accept that manuals are used only by consumers who want to use them in
conjunction with unauthorised copies of computer programs.
11.102 In its interim report, the PSA noted that instruction manuals are
invariably included in the purchase price of packaged computer
(p. 153). Such manuals are essential to explain the installation and
operation of the computer program. As mentioned in
paragraph 11.101, the
relaxation of the importation provisions of the Act as they apply to books does
not extend to computer manuals.
In its final report the PSA recommended that
s.44A(9) of the Act be amended to include a manual sold with a computer program,
use in connection with that program in the definition of ‘book’
(p. 81). The Committee notes that such an amendment would
prevent the owner of
effect of the PSA’s recommendation
by prohibiting importation of computer
program packages that contain computer manuals by relying on his or her
manuals. A corresponding amendment would also have to be made
in respect to the published edition copyright in s.112A(9).
11.103 Having reconsidered the its position in relation to parallel
importation generally, the Committee still adheres to the view
it expressed in
the Draft Report and as stated above in paragraph 11.101 that the use made of
manuals is not just by consumers in
conjunction with unauthorised copies of
computer programs but rather by the industry for development reasons.
Accordingly, the Committee
recommends that computer manuals that are available
separately from computer programs, should be able to be imported in the same
as other books (Recommendation 2.39(c)).
Second-hand computer programs
11.104 The issue of the importation of second-hand computer programs was only
raised in a limited context to the Committee, namely,
coin-operated amusement
machines. The Committee received a number of submissions on this issue from the
coin-operated amusement machine
industry. Coin-operated amusement machines
provide games which are based on often highly sophisticated computer programs.
submitted that the local industry is totally dependent on overseas
manufacturers for product. Games often have only a short term
novelty value,
sometimes lasting no more than a few weeks. Following this period the games are
made available on the overseas market
second-hand. Often only the printed
circuit board with the necessary electronics is sold and prices are reduced to
reflect the lowered
earning potential of the game. In response to this practice,
a number of Australian importers of those products have established
distribution agreements with overseas manufacturers and have begun asserting
their exclusive distribution rights. This
has prevented other importers from
bringing into Australia second-hand games programs (incorporated in the printed
circuit boards)
in competition with the games controlled under the exclusive
distribution agreements.
11.105 These submissions raise two issues. First, should second-hand programs
be excluded from the operation of the importation provisions?
On this point, as
a matter of policy, the Committee is not aware of any reason for treating
second-hand computer programs any differently
to “new” computer
programs. Accordingly, the Committee contemplates that its recommendation
concerning the importation
provisions should apply equally to second-hand
computer programs (Recommendation 2.39(d)). The second issue is that of the
of the CL Act and the
. This arises because, as understood
by the Committee, most computer games are stored in integrated circuits which in
turn are attached
to printed circuit boards. Having regard to this the Committee
is of the view that in such cases second-hand computer programs should
with in accordance with its recommendation concerning the overlap of the CL Act
in Chapter 10 Importation of computer manuals
11.106 The PSA Report also raised the issue of penalties (p. 83). It
suggested that different penalties could be prescribed in respect
copying and piracy. The Committee has already noted that the Act distinguishes
between own-use copying, which is a civil
infringement of copyright, and piracy
which is a criminal offence (paragraph 11.78). In civil proceedings plaintiffs
are awarded
damages determined by the courts having regard to the damage done to
their intellectual property. In piracy prosecutions criminal
sanctions will
apply. In this sense different penalties already apply in respect of these
activities and no change to the present
situation appears to be needed.
Educational Use of Computer Programs
12.01 The Committee noted in its Issues Paper that the value of computer
programs in education is widely recognised (p. 21). This
in turn has led to an
increasing demand by educational institutions for more ready access to programs
suitable for their education
12.02 Submissions to the Committee in response to the Issues Paper, and some
of those following the public hearings, identified a
number of issues of
particular concern to both educational institutions, as users of computer
programs, and those computer program
manufacturers who supply educational
institutions. A number of submissions drew to the Committee’s attention
the fact that
in most cases schools use computer programs on personal computers
and do not rely on large mainframe systems for teaching purposes.
In this regard
school use of computer programs can be distinguished from some of the
applications in tertiary institutions. There
is also an increasing tendency for
tertiary institutions to write their own materials. As authors, they are keen to
ensure a balance
between reasonable access to information and fair remuneration
for the provision of it.
12.03 The requirements of schools, both primary and secondary, in respect of
the use of computer programs were concisely set out in
the Australian Education
Council’s (AEC) submission to the Committee (pp. 6–7). Those
requirements are:
(a) Education departments at system or local level need to be able to use
software at different locations for preview, evaluation,
trial and demonstration
(b) Education centres, which provide continuing education for teachers, and
consultants need to be able to use software to instruct
in-service teachers on
the range and use of software in schools.
(c) Schools do not always need multiple copies of software but they need to
be able to buy a program with a right to make a backup
copy or to be able to
make a backup for archival purposes in case of disk failure.
(d) Schools lend a variety of educational resources to each other and obtain
other resources from departmental libraries and education/resource
supplement their own resources. They need to be able to borrow computer software
in the same way. This is of crucial importance
to small schools who do not have
the financial resources to buy the large number of software packages needed and
often only require
them for one or two weeks a year.
(e) Teachers often need to preview software before purchasing it for a school
in order to see if it fits into the curriculum needs
of that school.
(f) Teachers need to preview/learn software before use in the classroom. This
sometimes necessitates using the package at home —
on a home computer.
(g) Primary schools frequently need multiple copies of curriculum software,
dependent upon the number of computers in a school, and
the size of the school.
Teachers may choose to use the software across the same year level or in the
case of word processing and
utility software across a number of year levels.
Even if only a single copy of software is required, it will almost certainly
to be used on different computers at different locations within the
(h) Secondary schools operate within a different environment. The computers
are often sited in a lab situation where there are a large
number of computers.
Teachers have classes for a limited time, and it would be an advantage to have
multiple copies available.
(i) There is a need on occasions to use software on a network where a number
of users at different computers can access, via the system,
the one piece of
software at the same time.
(j) Students need to copy software for research and study purposes.
12.04 The use of computer programs by higher education institutions was set
out in the submission to the Committee from the Australian
Vice-Chancellor’s Committee and the Australian Committee of Directors and
Principals Ltd (AVCC–ACDP) which made the following
comments (p. 1,
The use of computer software by higher education institutions has grown
markedly over the past few years. Courses involving computer-related
now extend to virtually all disciplines. Like most large organisations,
computer-based systems are heavily relied upon
for administration. Libraries in
higher education institutions use computer-based systems for library and
information storage and
retrieval and for computer assisted learning (CAL).
Library systems are generally very complex. Searching of remote and CD ROM
is now commonplace in most higher education institution libraries.
Many institutions have CAL networks with internally produced and
computer-assisted learning programs running from a hard disc. The role played by
computer software in the research activities
of higher education institutions
has also increased. Apart from providing a basis for software development
itself, commercial computer
programs are used for such tasks as the correlation
and analysis of data, simulation and modelling, and computer-aided design.
THE PRICE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS
12.05 One of the issues raised before the Committee was that schools should
have access to computer programs for a “realistic”
fee which would
enable the school to run the computer programs on multiple computers. In
response to this claim Microsoft Pty Ltd
noted that no other copyright subject
matter supplied to schools is subject to a test of whether the price is fair.
Nor are other
essential services and materials supplied to educational
institutions at a special price. It was also submitted that all major computer
program suppliers already have arrangements whereby educational institutions,
including students and members of staff, are able to
obtain computer programs
more cheaply than others. In effect, access to computer programs should continue
to be determined by competitive
forces only.
12.06 One criticism that was levelled at schools in respect of the purchase
of computer programs was that in many instances they failed
appropriately for their computer program requirements. It was claimed that in
some cases schools purchased expensive hardware
only to find they had
insufficient funds to purchase the necessary computer programs to utilise the
initial purchase properly. One
submission to the Committee commented that it was
really a matter for the responsible State governments to ensure there was a
level of funding available for the purchase of computer programs by
12.07 The Committee notes the concerns of some schools and the computer
program producers on this issue. The Committee is not satisfied
that providing
computer programs at a cheaper rate for schools is justified. Given that no
other copyright subject matter is subject
to a “fair price” test, it
would be unfair to impose such a direction on computer program producers.
12.08 In the Draft Report, at paragraph 12.07, reference was made to the
decision of the majority of the Committee with respect to
parallel importation.
The Committee said:
The Committee’s majority recommendation concerning parallel importation
has regard to the PSA’s report on the prices of
computer programs.
Implementation of that recommendation, which accords with the PSA’s
recommendation, is expected by the majority
of the Committee to bring down the
price of computer programs.
12.09 The Committee has now formed the view that parallel importation should
not be allowed (see the discussion in Chapter 11). Whether
or not this
recommendation is followed, the Committee notes that submissions made to the
Committee following the Draft Report indicate
that the price of computer
programs has fallen (Submissions of AIAA and Discussion Papers of DITARD and
Treasury). As such, the Committee
recommends no change to the current
arrangements. The Committee hopes that this trend in the software industry will
continue so that
educational institutions are able to benefit from lower prices
of computer programs.
12.10 Submissions to the Committee concerning the terms of licensing
agreements concluded with computer program suppliers were generally
critical of
the scope and flexibility of the agreements and the willingness of suppliers to
meet the needs of the educational institutions.
In particular it was claimed
that the terms of licences for the use of computer programs were poorly defined.
The Committee notes,
however, that this may not be a universal problem. One
computer program supplier, Lotus Development Pty Ltd, commented that at least
relation to the terms of its licence agreements, it had not been made aware of
any particular difficulties encountered by educational
institutions.
12.11 It was also submitted that licences failed to address issues such as
the storage and loan of computer software by school libraries
and resource
centres. It was submitted by the Minister for Education (WA) that the use of
computer programs by libraries and resource
centres should be clarified in
legislation, so that standard rules applied to educational institutions to
provide both protection
and to ensure compliance on the part of users. It was
also suggested that specific provisions allow educational institutions to make
back-up and multiple copies of programs, including libraries and resource
centres. Autodesk Australia commented that if there were
to be legislative
provision made for the loan of computer programs, it should ensure that the
The basis of such a calculation
should have regard to the period of use of a particular program.
12.12 At a more general level, the comments received from educational
institutions by the Committee on the terms of existing licence
agreements were
critical of the uncertainty of the meaning of terms such as “site
licence” between individual agreements.
Particular problems perceived by
educational institutions, including tertiary institutions, relate to site
licences for the use of
computer software on network systems which in most cases
requires the making of ephemeral
multiple copies of computer programs
where the software is downloaded to a work station. It was also noted that the
concept of a site
licence was not particularly amenable to application where an
institution serviced external students. It was suggested by the Computers
Education Project (Ministry of Education, WA) that there is a need to develop
standard licences, which should be issued to State
or central educational
authorities. In this regard the Committee notes the comments in the submission
from the AEC that it intends
to negotiate a standard educational site licence
that would be acceptable to computer program suppliers across the country.
12.13 In its Issues Paper the Committee commented that the problems faced by
educational institutions could be approached in either
of these two ways
(pp. 22–23):
• by leaving the situation as it is and allowing educational
institutions and computer program manufacturers to negotiate a system
voluntary licences which cater for the specific needs of particular
institutions; or
• by introducing a statutory licence as has been done in respect of
works and broadcast audio–visual copyright materials.
12.14 These two options were canvassed at the public hearings held in Sydney
in 1990 and addressed in some of the submissions received
by the Committee
following those hearings. The majority of educational interests and computer
program suppliers expressed the view
strongly that a statutory licence scheme
was not the appropriate way of dealing with the issue of educational use of
computer programs.
The Australian Copyright Council submitted that a statutory
licence scheme is not an appropriate response to complaints about the
such a scheme is to meet circumstances where
the copyright owners are too
numerous and voluntary licences are impossible to negotiate, as indicated to the
Committee by the AVCC–ACDP,
in the case of computer programs, the relevant
12.15 The Committee also notes that, unlike other literary works, which may
be copied by educational institutions under the statutory
licence scheme
established in Part VB of the
(the Act), it would only
be in unusual circumstances that an educational institution would seek to copy
only part of a program. Usually
the whole program would be required. Special
circumstances would include those where part of a program may need to be copied
the purpose of teaching students about the function of the program rather
than using the program for the purpose for which it was
12.16 Having regard to the above considerations the Committee recommends, in
accordance with the expressed preference of most educational
institutions and
makers of computer programs, that a statutory licence scheme for the educational
use of computer programs should
not be established (Recommendation 2.40(a).
However, the Committee notes the past experiences of educational institutions in
to negotiate with copyright owners, and the efforts of both sides to
conclude mutually acceptable agreements. It therefore expresses
some doubt as to
the likelihood of both parties reaching agreement in the absence of a statutory
regime to fall back upon and recommends
that the Government should review the
situation in three years time to determine whether an optional statutory licence
scheme should
be introduced to encourage voluntary licensing (Recommendation
12.17 Educational institutions also raised three other issues namely backup
copying, liability for infringement and electrocopying
(in submissions following
the Draft Report). The issue of backup copying is discussed more fully at
paragraphs 10.13–10.17.
The issue of electrocopying is discussed more
fully from paragraph 14.09.
LIABILITY FOR
INFRINGEMENT—AUTHORISATION
12.18 Educational institutions raised a concern that they may be held liable
for authorising copyright infringement by making computing
facilities available
to staff and students and for failing to prevent copying by the use of those
facilities. Discussions at the
public hearings and submissions to the Committee
focussed on the need for a provision analogous to s.39A of the Act which
infringing copies of works made on machines installed in libraries and
12.19 Section 39A provides:
(a) a person makes an infringing copy of, or of part of, a work on a machine
for the making, by reprographic reproduction, of copies
of documents, being a
machine installed by or with the approval of the body administering a library or
archives, on the premises
of the library or archives or outside those premises
for the convenience of persons using the library or archives; and
(b) there is affixed to, or in close proximity to, the machine, in a place
readily visible to persons using the machine, a notice
of the prescribed
dimensions and in accordance with the prescribed form;
neither the body administering the library or archives nor the officer in
charge of the library or archives shall be taken to have
authorised the making
of the infringing copy by reason only that the copy was made on that
12.20 The Department of State Services (WA) submitted that the owner of a
computer program package should not be responsible for infringements
by other users of that package. The AVCC–ACDP also commented in its
submission that at many higher education institutions
there is multiple public
access to micro computer laboratories. It expressed concern that institutions
would be open to the possibility
of authorisation actions flowing from students
and staff copying programs using institutional equipment. Accordingly, it
recommended
an amendment of s.39A to include reference to the making of machine
readable copies by use of machines in libraries and higher education
institutions.
12.21 The Committee notes the view expressed in submissions that in some
cases educational institutions may have insufficient resources
to allocate to
the supervision of students to ensure that they do not infringe copyright in
computer programs. Nonetheless, it is
of the view that this in itself is not
sufficient justification to remove a copyright owners’ right to seek
redress for the
copying of computer programs. Accordingly, the Committee
recommends that no change be made to the Act in this respect (Recommendation
12.22 The Committee also notes the concerns expressed by educational
institutions about the uncertainty in the minds of educators
and administrators
of educational institutions as to what the law provides with respect to computer
programs. The Committee encourages
the various State Education Departments and
the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee to embark upon and maintain a regular
of providing general advice to educational institutions as to their
rights and obligations under the Act. Given the complex nature
of the Act it
would be prudent for those bodies to seek appropriate legal advice in relation
to any matter that requires clarification.
Works Made with the Assistance of Computer Programs and
Computer-Generated Materials
13.01 In its Draft Report the Committee noted that the use of computers to
produce various materials is becoming more and more commonplace
and that the
technology involved is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Computer programs
are used to manipulate databases to create
valuable output often without the
expenditure of much identifiable human skill or effort. Examples of these
include programs for
desk top publishing, programs which facilitate the
presentation of financial, statistical, meteorological and seismic geological
information, computer aided design packages and expert systems which are
increasingly being used to solve problems in a wide range
of areas including:
the diagnosis of medical conditions, legal advice and problems with
13.02 With respect to the examples given above it is clear that some of the
materials are created only with the assistance of computer
programs. For example
a literary work written using a personal computer and a word processing program
is clearly created using the
computer program as a tool. However, while this
example is clear cut the Committee recognises that in some cases, because of the
interactive nature of the technology used to create materials or because
computer programs are operating equipment automatically,
it will be more
difficult to separate the contribution of the user (if any) from that of the
computer/computer program. Furthermore,
the contributions of each to the final
product are likely to be of varying degrees in different circumstances. It can
also be argued
that in many cases materials generated by a programmed computer
would constitute an original literary, musical or artistic work if
they had been
created solely by a human author.
13.03 In the light of submissions made to the Committee since the Draft
Report the Committee has come to the view that a distinction
can and should be
drawn between those materials created with the assistance of computer programs
and those created by computer programs
in circumstances where there is no
identifiable human author (so called “computer-generated works”). To
determine how
such materials should be protected requires a consideration of
first, whether what is created is in fact an original copyright work,
secondly, if it is, who should be regarded as the author or alternatively, the
first owner of copyright. The following discussion
examines these issues in
respect of each of these types of materials.
MATERIALS CREATED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF COMPUTER
13.04 Materials created with the assistance of computer programs include, as
in the example already given, literary works written
on a computer using a word
processing package, musical scores composed using musical software, and artistic
works such as engineering
design drawings, logos and images used in
advertisements. In cases such as these the computer and the relevant software
used by the creator of the work as a tool which facilitates the
creation of the work. In its submission dated 31 August 1993, Oracle
(Australia) Pty Limited (Oracle) raised the issue of the use of CASE (computer
aided software engineering) programs and the
need for both clients and
consultants who use such programs to be sure of the ownership of resulting code.
The Committee takes the
view that this is another example of materials created
with the assistance of a computer program. The ownership and protection of
materials should be determined in each case having regard to the principles
discussed below.
13.05 The issue of who should be the author of materials produced with the
aid of a computer was considered in the UK by the Whitford
Committee in 1977
(Cmnd 6732). In its report the Whitford Committee stated (paragraphs
In this matter we feel the correct approach is to look on the computer as a
mere tool in much the same way as a slide rule or even,
in a simple sense, a
paint brush. A very sophisticated tool it may be, with considerable powers to
extend man’s capabilities
to create new works, but a tool
nevertheless.
On that basis it is clear that the author of the output can be none other
than the person or persons who devised the instructions
and originated the data
used to control and condition the computer to produce the particular result. In
many cases it will be a matter
of joint authorship. We realise that this in
itself can cause problems but no more than in some other fields, and we are not
there is a need for special treatment.
13.06 The issue of authorship of materials created with the assistance of a
computer program was also considered by the Commission
of the European
Communities. In its
Green Paper on Copyright and the Challenge of
Technology—Copyright Issues Requiring Immediate Action,
1988 (COM (88)
172–final ) the Commission took the view that (paragraph 5.6.26):
. . . it is those who use the programmed computer, which is essentially a
tool, who should be regarded as entitled to protection.
The view taken by the Commission appears to acknowledge that the more
appropriate analogy is to regard the programmed computer, rather
than a computer
by itself, as a tool.
13.07 In the Committee’s view the copyright protection of materials
created with the assistance of computer programs should
be based on the same
principles as apply to works created using traditional means. In other words, if
the materials produced with
the assistance of a computer program amount to an
original form of expression of an idea, and that expression comes within one of
the recognised categories of works protected under the
(the Act) the materials should also be protected as such, protection being
granted regardless of how much easier the author’s
task may have been made
by the use of the computer program.
Who should be the author of a work created with the
assistance of a computer program?
13.08 It follows from the discussion in paragraphs 13.05-13.07 that the
person who uses the programmed computer as a tool in order
to create a new
13.09 Under the Act “author” is not defined, except in relation
to photographs (s.10(1)). Section 32 provides, in effect,
that copyright
subsists in a work of which the author is a qualified person. Section 32(4)
defines “qualified person”
as meaning:
. . . an Australian citizen, an Australian protected person or a person
resident in Australia.
Accordingly, the author of a copyright work created with the assistance of a
computer program must be a natural person. Of course,
the copyright owner may be
a natural or legal person (s.35).
13.10 Matters such as the ownership and duration of copyright in such works
created with the assistance of a computer program should
be determined according
to the existing provisions of the Act.
MATERIALS CREATED BY COMPUTER PROGRAMS
(“COMPUTER-GENERATED WORKS”)
13.11 In contrast to the situation described already, where a work is clearly
the product of the labour of a human author and the
computer program is a mere
aid, is the circumstance where it is difficult, or not possible, to say that the
computer output is the
result of the labour of an individual or individuals.
Perhaps the simplest example to consider is that of satellite images of things
such as weather patterns, vegetation, and geological formations. In many cases
the data that makes up these images is collected automatically
by remote sensors
on satellites. The information is automatically processed by specialised
computer programs and the final image
down loaded or printed out in hard copy
form either automatically or at the press of a button.
13.12 Another example would be the report generated by an expert system.
There are two components to an expert system, a so called
knowledge base, and an
inference engine. The knowledge base is in effect a data base that contains the
knowledge of one or more experts
in a particular field. The inference engine
contains the problem solving knowledge that enables the expert system to decide
apply the specialist knowledge to the facts the user supplies in order to
solve the problem posed by the user. It is a computer program
that applies the
knowledge to the problems. The solution suggested, or the report produced,
depends on the data entered by the user.
In most cases the data entered will be
determined by the circumstances in which the expert system is being used rather
result of any selection on the part of the user.
The nature of computer-generated material
13.13 A number of submissions received by the Committee following the release
of the Draft Report did not support the Committee’s
classification of
“computer-generated works” as “works” under the Act. The
Australian Copyright Council (ACC)
was opposed to the notion that an
“author” could be something other than a human and therefore had
difficulty with the
Committee’s recommendation that
“computer-generated works” with no identifiable author could be
protected as “works”
under the Act, especially as the requirement
for originality in “works” may not be satisfied. The ACC appeared to
suggesting that “computer-generated works” should be protected by
the Act as subject matter other than works.
13.14 The Committee has considered the submission of the ACC to the effect
that “computer-generated works” are not properly
a category of
“works”, lacking as they do a human author. The Committee agrees
with the ACC’s submission. It notes
that while there are a variety of ways
in which copyright systems around the world provide protection to the various
subject matters
they encompass, those materials which are protected as
“works” have a human author. This would appear to be consistent
the principles embodied in the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary
and Artistic Works. The other requirement for
of authorship must satisfy some notion of originality ie. be the product of some
skill and labour
on the part of the author.
13.15 As already noted, one of the features of computer-generated material is
that it has no identifiable human author. The examples
given in paragraphs 13.11
and 13.12 are, in the Committee’s view, clear examples of
computer-generated materials that, but
for the lack of a human author, could be
classified as original copyright works. A satellite image is not the product of
of any one author—in this respect it differs from a
photograph—nor can it, in the Committee’s view, be properly
considered to be the result of the combined efforts of a number of joint
authors. A report generated by an expert system is also,
on closer examination,
one that lacks a human author. The compiler of the knowledge base, and the
author of the inference engine
computer program cannot be regarded as authors of
the output of the expert system as that output will be determined in each case
by the data that is entered. It is also difficult to attribute authorship to the
person entering the data (the user) as the data
entered will necessarily be
determined by the circumstances that have given rise to the need to use the
expert system rather than
any process of selection involving the exercise of
skill and judgment by the user.
13.16 In so far as these types of computer-generated materials are deserving
of protection it seems to the Committee that the protection
that they should
attract is more akin to that extended to neighbouring rights. In other words the
protection that is extended to
performers, producers of phonograms and
broadcasting organisations. That protection emerged in response to the
development of new
techniques of disseminating cultural materials, and the
development of technology that enabled the making of accurate and cheap copies.
One of the characteristics of this type of protection is that there is not the
same need for originality. The term of protection
is also shorter which, as is
the case with industrial property protection, reflects the fact that the object
of protection is investment,
rather than creativity.
13.17 Under the Act the neighbouring rights of producers of phonograms (sound
recordings) and broadcasters are protected as subject
matter other than works.
Having regard to this and the reasons given above, the Committee considers that
it is appropriate to afford
protection, as subject matter other than works, to a
new class of subject matter to be described as “computer-generated
(Recommendation 2.42(a)).
13.18 In the Draft Report the Committee recommended the adoption of a
definition of “computer-generated work” along the
lines of the one
used in s.178 of the UK
(paragraph 13.08). Since the Committee has reconsidered its recommendation
regarding computer-generated material it now
recommends that the following
definition be added to the Act (Recommendation 2.42(b)):
“computer-generated”, in relation to computer-generated material,
means that the material is generated by computer in
circumstances such that
there is no human author of the material.
Ownership of copyright in computer-generated
13.19 In the Draft Report the Committee also considered the question of
identifying the author of a “computer-generated work”.
It observed
that the author could be one of the following four parties (paragraph
(a) the programmer or owner of the copyright in the programs that assisted in
creation of the work;
(b)the provider of the data;
(c)the user of the computer/computer program; or
(d)the investor or owner of the computer/computer program.
13.20 In light of the Committee’s recommendation above, regarding the
classification of computer-generated material, it is no
longer necessary to
consider these parties in relation to the question of authorship. However, this
division of interests is helpful
in determining who should be the first owner of
of computer-generated material as subject matter other than works it is the
investor or owner of the computer/computer program who
should be the owner of
the copyright in any material generated by its use. It will be that person who
makes the necessary arrangements
for the creation of the material.
13.21 In the Draft Report the Committee also referred to s.9(3) of the UK CDP
Act which defines who the author of a “computer-generated
and recommended that a similar definition be adopted by the Act. The Committee
noted that the treatment of authorship
in relation to “computer-generated
works” equated with that for films and sound recordings. As a result of
in its recommendation above, namely, that computer-generated material
be protected by the Act as subject matter other than works,
the Committee now
recommends that the Act be amended to provide with respect to authorship of
computer-generated material that (Recommendation
In the case of computer-generated material, the author shall be taken to be
the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the
creation of the material
are undertaken.
13.22 In its submission the Australian Information Industry Association
Limited (AIIA) did not believe that “computer-generated
material) should receive special protection. It identified a number of practical
difficulties if such “works”
were protected, such as, defining if
and when a “work” is computer-generated; defining who
“arranges” for
the creation of the work; distinguishing which parts
of the expression in an application are computer-generated, which are generic
industry standards and which are uniquely “authored” by humans. The
Committee notes these concerns but takes the view
that the drawing of a
distinction between materials created with the assistance of a computer program
and those that are computer-generated
is one that will be able to be determined
in each case having regard to the circumstances. Similarly the determination of
of who is the person that arranges for the creation of the
work/materials should not be any more difficult than determining the identity
the maker of a cinematograph film for the purposes of the Act.
Duration of protection of computer-generated
13.23 The Committee has also considered the issue of the appropriate period
for the duration of copyright in computer-generated material.
Having regard to
its recommendation that computer-generated material be protected as subject
matter other than works the Committee
is of the view that copyright should
subsist in such material for 25 years from the end of the year in which the
computer-generated
material is made (Recommendation 2.42(d)).
Works Stored in Computer Memory: Databases
INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS
14.01 Storage of works in computer memory is now a commonplace occurrence.
Scanning equipment has made it possible for private individuals
to transfer
printed works to computer storage almost as easily as making a photocopy. Data
can be “downloaded” from a
and freely manipulated to suit the user’s wishes. Commercial interests
make works available
either through connection to a remote database or through
the supply of a copy in various machine readable formats. Multi-media works
produced containing text, sound and graphics. Interactive multi-media works
permit the user to move about freely within the work
and create new combinations
of sounds and images to match the user’s requirements. Word processing
programs are so pervasive,
being found in computers down to the cheapest and
simplest home computer, that a substantial and rapidly increasing proportion of
all words in print have reached that state via a word processor. Every word
processor has a computer memory, however rudimentary
or sophisticated, and
printing businesses of any size print from manuscript in electronic form or
otherwise employ computerised typesetting
or formatting. The Committee is under
no illusion about the universality of use of storage on computer memory in the
production of
the printed word.
14.02 Where works are stored in computer memory for commercial purposes,
access to those works and their use are in most cases covered
agreements. The Committee does not propose to consider the adequacy or
appropriateness of these contractual agreements
for the protection of the
authors of works stored in computer memory insofar as they control use by the
contracted user. Whether
use by others is legitimate will be determined by the
terms of the licence and the circumstances of that use.
14.03 In its Draft Report, the Committee commented that the facilities for
and printing material
stored in computer memory were still new enough to dazzle the average person.
The Committee noted, however,
that the electronically stored databases
themselves were not fundamentally different from databases that have been
compiled through
vastly slower, non-electronic means in times past. There was no
shortage of examples of large non-electronic databases which raised
issues in relation to authorship, ownership and duration of copyright
protection. Such databases, comprising cards or files,
might be constantly
updated, be created by numerous people and be accessible to many others who were
jointly working on them. The
information that they contained might be selected
and combined in new, previously unthought of ways. The Committee said that it
to draw attention to this at the outset of its discussion of databases to
indicate what had guided its approach in seeking to isolate
the fundamental
differences between storage and manipulation of material in computer memory and
such treatment of material in non-electronic
form. The Committee did not regard
electronic storage as necessarily raising a whole set of unprecedented copyright
14.04 In his comments on the Draft Report, Mr David Lindsay, Research
Associate at the Centre for Media and Telecommunications Law
and Policy, Law
School, University of Melbourne (who presented his paper at the CIRCIT seminar
on the Draft Report in September 1993)
felt that the capacity of the user to
select information from a computerised database was so powerful, that making
protection of
such databases depend on their originality by reason of the
selection and arrangement of the data ignored the reality that the user,
needs. All the operator had to do was to ensure
that the database was
comprehensive and up to date. Similar views were expressed in the submission by
Messrs John Houghton and Robert
Reid–Smith from the Centre for
International Research on Communication and Information Technologies (CIRCIT).
14.05 The Committee acknowledges that the power put in the hands of computer
data should not be
understated. However, in so saying, it does not think that this should
overshadow the creativity of conceiving
the idea of the contents of a
contents—and, for that matter,
choosing (or even creating) the software by
which users may search it for their individual needs. On the other hand, the
acknowledges that some computer databases, if easily established or
comprising a certain kind of data, may lack sufficient originality
entitled to copyright protection. The Committee has, later in this chapter,
drawn attention to the EC
Amended Proposal for a Council Directive on the
legal Protection of Databases
(COM(93) 464 final—SYN 393, October
1993) (Directive on Databases) which proposes a form of
sui generis
protection for non-original databases (see paragraph 14.75 below).
14.06 From a copyright perspective the protection of works stored in computer
memory raises several issues:
whether the scope of the rights afforded to authors of works
aggregated in databases is adequate, having regard to any new uses available
works stored on computer;
whether the authors of computerised databases, ie, collections
of works and other materials stored in computer memory, need protection
additional to that afforded by present legislation;
whether the authors of interactive multi-media materials
need protection additional to that afforded by present legislation; and
whether there are now new kinds of works not covered by
present copyright legislation.
14.07 Submissions received by the Committee also raised questions concerning
the need for a statutory licence to govern the input
and retrieval of works into
and from computer memory (see paragraphs 14.09–14.11), the rights of
authors whose works are stored
in computer memory (discussed from paragraph
14.09), as well as the need for rights in respect of screen displays (paragraph
Submissions from the Australian Copyright Council (ACC), the Australian
Information Industry Association (AIIA), the Copyright Agency
Limited (CAL), IBM
Australia Limited, the Western Australian Government Department of Computing and
Information Technology (WADCIT)
and the Western Australian Government Department
of State Services (WADSS) all supported the principle of protection for
CURRENT PROTECTION OF WORKS STORED IN COMPUTER
(the Act) currently extends protection to
all forms of original works stored in computer memory. An original work created
use of a computer and therefore first fixed in storage in its memory
will be protected under the Act. Section 22 provides that a
work is made when it
is first reduced to writing or to some other material form and, as a result of
the 1984 amendments, s.10(1)
provides that material form:
. . . includes any form (whether visible or not) of storage from which the
work or adaptation . . . can be reproduced.
As discussed in Chapters 5 and 6, it is clear that these provisions extend
stored in a
form which is not perceptible to the human senses.
RIGHTS IN WORKS STORED IN COMPUTER MEMORY
A USE RIGHT
14.09 In its submission to the Committee CAL noted that the use of analogue
and optical character recognition (OCR) scanners enable
users to “capture,
store, view, print and modify documents”. CAL referred to the use of this
technology as “electrocopying”.
Electrocopying enables users to
transfer copyright and other material from hard copy form to machine-readable
form, from one machine-readable
form to another and from machine-readable form
to hard-copy form. The Committee understands that scanning technology is
rapidly and, indeed, that the latest generation of photocopying
machine in fact scans the material and stores it on a database prior
to printing
the required copy, with the obvious capacity thereby to retain what is scanned
in electronic memory.
14.10 The Draft Report noted (paragraph 14.08) CAL’s submission that,
to control these activities, copyright owners should be
granted a “use
right” which would entitle them to regulate the input and retrieval of
works into and from computer memory.
In the Draft Report, the Committee
commented that, having regard to the scope of the copyright owner’s right
under the Act
to reproduce his or her works in a material form, the Committee
was not persuaded that a “use right” such as that proposed
was justified or necessary. The Committee’s view was that both the acts of
storage and retrieval in hard-copy would
result in the work being reproduced in
a material form within the meaning of the Act. The Committee’s
recommendation in paragraph
6.55 and its comments in 6.56 that an inclusive
definition of “reproduction” be added to the Act puts it beyond
that digitisation of a work and hard-copy reproduction of a work existing
only in digital form would both be regarded as reproductions.
14.11 In commenting on the Draft Report, the Australian Council of Libraries
and Information Services (ACLIS) supported the Committee's
opposition to a new
use right, while in their submission Messrs Houghton and Reid–Smith
submitted that the fundamental difference
that they considered existed between
electronic databases and traditional hard-copy databases (see paragraph 14.04
above) justified
a use right for the former. CAL asked the Committee (p.1):
. . . to clarify the extent to which, under the existing provisions of the
for free use and remunerable statutory licences, works can be
stored, supplied or manipulated electronically.
CAL challenged the notion, which it attributed to the Committee, that
photocopying and electrocopying were “functionally equivalent”.
Committee is of the opinion that, having regard to its conclusions and
recommendations, made later in this chapter, regarding
rights of owners of
need to further consider an
additional right to use a work stored
electronically, such as has been proposed (see from paragraph 14.31)
(Recommendation 2.43).
THE REPRODUCTION RIGHT
Electrocopying
14.12 In the Draft Report, the Committee noted that CAL had submitted that
the reproduction of works by electrocopying should be the
subject of a statutory
licence to ensure that copyright owners received appropriate compensation for
the reproduction of their works.
In their submissions to the Committee the WADSS
and the WADCIT had suggested that the storage, retrieval of and access to works
computer memory should be left to contract and not controlled by legislation.
The Committee was of the view that the case for a statutory
licence had not been
made out in CAL’s submission. The
which responded to the rapid spread of photocopying, did not introduce any
general statutory licence for photocopying, although
it did introduce guidelines
on what copying would be a fair dealing, which is a provision of general
application. The Committee said
that it had seen nothing to suggest that the
nature or use of electrocopying was such as to warrant subjecting it to a
general licence
by virtue of its being an act of reproduction. It noted that it
was always open to copyright owners to enter into voluntary licensing
with people or organisations seeking to copy their material and it is therefore
with interest that the Committee notes
a press report late in 1994 that CAL has
concluded an agreement with the BHP Company voluntarily licensing it to
photocopy works
in the course of business. In commenting on the Draft Report, Mr
Lindsay thought that in view of the rapid growth in databases the
should reconsider its opposition to a statutory licence. Without more detailed
supporting argument, the Committee is not
convinced that it should do so. It is
also mindful that a general licence such as proposed by CAL might contravene
Australia’s
international obligations under the Berne Convention for the
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Berne Convention) (Recommendation
14.13 The Committee agrees with Mr Lindsay and Messrs Houghton and
Reid–Smith (paragraph 14.04 above) that the distinguishing
feature of a
computer database is the facility whereby it can be connected to a network of
terminals from any of which the database
can be accessed using computer program
(whether screen
display is a reproduction or a public performance is dealt with
below). This assessment was strongly endorsed by the Hydrographic
Service, Royal
Australian Navy (RAN). In the Draft Report, the Committee made comments to the
effect that the inclusion of a work
in an electronic database increased the
value of that work to both the database operator and the author because of the
viewing facilities of electronic databases, which conventional hard
copies of works lacked. The Committee also said that the increased
work in that form would give cause to a copyright owner to seek from the
reflected the value of the work
once included in the database. The Committee endorses the comments it made in
the Draft Report noting
that the RAN submitted that the value of the database in
its entirety would give cause to the maker of the database (or other person
might be the owner of copyright in the database) to seek protection against
unauthorised access to the database.
14.14 In its Draft Report (paragraph 14.10), the Committee commented that
networking of a database was akin to broadcasting or, more
precisely, cable
diffusion, where the copyright owner sought a licence fee calculated in
accordance with the expected audience that
would receive the broadcast or
diffusion. In both cases, the copyright owner had to collect whatever licence
fee could be successfully
negotiated “up front” from the broadcaster
or operator of the diffusion service, as the act of receiving the broadcast
diffusion was not a use of copyright for which the copyright owner could seek
remuneration, let alone do so practically. Since
the Draft Report, the
increasing focus on the “convergence” of means of transmission of
information and entertainment—over-the-air
broadcasting, cable
transmission of program material, telephony and data transmission—in the
“information superhighway”
has served to confirm the aptness of the
Committee’s comparison in the Draft Report.
14.15 Returning to computer database networking, if screen display is not an
exercise of the copyright owner’s rights or, if
it is, assuming that it
would be practically impossible for individual copyright owners to seek
remuneration from individual network
users, it is all the more important for the
operator, given that a network user can repeatedly access the database
(cf broadcasting and cable diffusion which are at present
non-“interactive”—although interactive opportunities for
receivers are said to be on the way). In commenting on
the Draft Report, Oracle
(Systems) Australia Pty Ltd (Oracle) referred to the practical difficulties of
monitoring access to databases
linked to a worldwide network, and recommended
consultation with copyright owners on the technical possibilities for effective
of remuneration.
14.16 The Committee acknowledges that with the increasing growth in numbers,
and ongoing development, of databases consisting of large
collections of
become ever more concerned at the
likelihood of unauthorised, and
non-remunerated, uses of their materials. It is also quite likely that this
concern will lead to
the establishment of a collecting society to administer the
rights of those copyright owners. It could be expected that in Australia
role might be taken over by an existing collecting society, such as the
society. Such a
development would have clear advantages for both database makers and copyright
owners. It would simplify the process
of establishing databases by providing a
single body to authorise the use of copyright materials and negotiate licence
fees on behalf
of copyright owners. In the absence of such a collecting society,
the law, be
required to negotiate permission to use materials separately with each copyright
owner. Recognising that such a collecting
society would have a virtual monopoly
over the use of many copyright materials the Committee said in its Draft Report
that it saw
considerable merit in any such society being brought under
of the Act by appropriate amendment to the Act, thereby extending the
confined in its
reaffirms that view, which it notes
is supported by comments received on the
Draft Report from CAL and the ACC (Recommendation 2.45 ).
Liability of database operators
14.17 In the Draft Report, the Committee considered the possibility that, in
the absence of a licence from the owner of copyright
in a work included in a
computer database, the database operator might, by networking it to subscribers,
be liable for authorising
infringement constituted by the printing of a
hard-copy of the work by a subscriber without the copyright owner’s
permission.
In other words, the database operator might be found to be in the
same position as was the library of the University of New South
Wales, which was
University of New South Wales
(1975) 133 CLR 1
to have authorised the copying of a work by an individual from a library book on
the photocopying machine provided by the library
for library users (which led to
the inclusion of s.39A in the Act).
14.18 In the Draft Report the Committee indicated that it was of the view
that the Act should include a provision to the effect that
where the licence to
the database operator did not extend to the making of hard-copies by database
users, the networking of the database
to subscribers would not, of itself,
amount to authorisation of the making of any hard-copies by users if accessing
the database
caused a message to appear on the screen containing relevant
information about copyright in the works in the database. This recommendation
was supported by ACLIS but thought to be unnecessary by the ACC.
14.19 The Committee considers that, particularly if a database operator will,
under the proposed new right of transmission to the
public accepted in principle
by the Government, be liable for acts of subscribers of calling up a work on
screen from the database
(see paragraph 14.40), it should reaffirm its
recommendation that the operator be able to avoid liability for hard-copy
reproduction
of the work by the subscriber if the operator arranges for a
message to advise subscribers of their copyright liability for such
reproduction
(Recommendation 2.46). The Committee has also considered whether the Act should
provide that the operator of a database
might avoid liability for copyright
infringement if he or she employed some technical means to prevent or control
downloading of
that while such technical means might be developed their implementation
not be easy and their effectiveness uncertain.
14.20 Finally, it should be noted that the Committee has discussed in Chapter
16 bulletin board systems and the activities of bulletin
board operators and
users, without reaching any conclusions on the level of liability that should be
attributed to bulletin board
operators for the activities of users of such
systems. In the Committee’s opinion the position of bulletin board
and database operators with respect to reproduction of copyright
material by users is somewhat different and for this reason the
Committee does
not consider that its recommendations in relation to database operators should
necessarily apply to bulletin board
operators. Without giving complete
consideration to the extent of the differences between such operators and
without having received
any submissions in relation to this issue, it is readily
apparent to the Committee that bulletin board operators are not in the primary
business of providing copyright materials to their users as are database
operators. Rather bulletin board operators provide the means
by which users may
choose to deposit and access copyright materials and for this reason, unlike
in a position to have negotiated with copyright
owners for the use of their materials. As the Committee has recommended in
16, the issues raised by bulletin board systems should be further
considered.
Copying by libraries and educational
institutions
14.21 In the Draft report, the Committee expressed the view that the
provisions of the Act concerning fair dealing, and the copying
of works in
libraries, would of course, apply to copying of works as stored on computer
more traditional formats. The
Committee also believed that, in the public interest, the provisions concerning
copying by libraries
and educational institutions should apply to storage of
works in computer memory. In particular, the Committee expressed the view
Part VB of the Act should allow educational institutions to make copies onto
computer memory for use by students, within the
same limits and subject to
payment of royalties under licensing agreements made with the appropriate
collecting society or as set
by the Copyright Tribunal. (As there is no similar
provision for subject matter other than works, any arrangements for copying of
such materials would remain subject to private licensing). The Committee
considered that it was doubtful that the licence under Part
VB to educational
institutions to make “one or more copies of . . . [a] work”
(s.135ZL) applied to scanning a work onto
a database, and considered that an
amendment to the Act should be made to confirm that the licence did so apply.
14.22 In commenting on the Draft Report, ACLIS supported the Committee's view
that the library copying provisions should extend to
electrocopying. In its
submission, CAL asked whether the Committee intended by its proposal regarding
library copying to allow libraries
to establish databases; if so, CAL suggested
that a “remuneratory statutory licence” to libraries for that
recommended. The ACC appeared to support CAL. CAL also challenged the
view of the Committee, which it inferred from the Draft Report,
electrocopying should be possible by way of fair dealing under s.40 to the same
extent as photocopying. Each of these proposals
is discussed in turn below.
Sections 49 and 50—copying by
14.23 In the Draft Report (paragraph 14.12), the Committee, albeit very
broadly and briefly, intended to convey the view that the
existing provisions
for libraries to make copies for library users (found in s.49) applied to the
making of electronic copies. The
Committee acknowledges that, in expressing this
view, it did not make it clear whether it also had in mind the provisions in
for inter-library copying. With regard to CAL's query, the Committee did
not intend that its proposal for extension of s.49 to supplying
copies could be used by libraries as a means of digitising their holdings, which
activity it agrees should be a matter
for negotiation with copyright owners or,
preferably and more practically, with an authorised collecting agency.
14.24 Section 49 has elaborate conditions to be satisfied before a copy can
be made and supplied by a library to a user, including
the requirement that the
user have the purpose of research or study in requesting a copy and that where a
request is made for more
than a reasonable portion of a work the relevant
library officer be satisfied that a copy of the work cannot be obtained within a
reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price (s.49(5)(b)). While the
Committee does not necessarily endorse the elaborate nature
of these conditions,
the Committee believes that they would prevent libraries—if indeed they
were so minded—from using
s.49, if amended as proposed, to systematically
digitise their collections.
14.25 In addition, the Committee does not consider that s.49, would apply so
as to enable works to be placed onto a database simply
for the purpose of
enabling a library user to browse through the works in the database on screen.
Section 49 is directed to the supply
of a copy, subject to the conditions
prescribed, and the Committee is proposing simply that that act include
electronic transmission
of a copy stored in digital form or the lending of an
electronic copy on a carrier such as a floppy disc. With more hesitation,
noting that the restriction on supply of a copy of more than a
reasonable portion of a work also applies to inter-library copying,
Committee extends its proposal to s.50 and affirms its recommendation in
relation to s.49 made in the Draft Report (Recommendation
14.26 In response to CAL’s other suggestion, that the licence to
libraries be subject to remuneration, the Committee considers
that given the
restricted circumstances in which copying can be undertaken by libraries under
ss.49 and 50, this suggestion cannot
be supported. As to CAL's further
suggestion that a separate review of library copying be recommended, the
Committee considers that
a review of the complexity of ss.49 and 50 could be
included in the Government's proposed examination of the whole Act. The
notes that the Government recently reaffirmed its intention to refer
such an examination to the Committee in its statement released
in October 1994
on cultural policy, entitled
Creative Nation
Section 39A—copying by users on library
facilities.
14.27 The Committee notes that s.39A protects libraries and archives from
liability for the making by users of infringing copies on
photocopying machines
provided for the convenience of users, if a prescribed notice is put up by the
library near the machine warning
of the limits of the fair dealing defence to
reproduction, especially
in the form of electrocopying as already noted, the
Committee believes that the section should be amended to better recognise the
access by users to libraries and archives holdings on databases. The Committee
accordingly recommends that the reference to making
“reprographic” copies should be removed from the section
(Recommendation 2.48(a)). In addition a requirement should
be added that, in the
case of accessing a work stored on a library or archives database via a computer
terminal made available to
users, a notice be incorporated with the display of
the work that advises users of the database of the copyright obligations
by printing out the work (Recommendation 2.48(b)). The Committee
considers that such amendments, which would be in line with its
recommendation
in paragraph 14.19 in regard to database operators in general, and would be
consistent with the operation of ss.49
and 50 it has proposed in paragraphs
14.23–14.26.
Part VB—copying by educational
institutions
14.28 The Committee's recommendation in the Draft Report that the educational
copying licence be extended to electrocopying was supported
by CAL, and
apparently by the AVCC which noted that the remuneration payable might be
different to that for hard copies. The ACC,
supporting CAL, noted that extension
of the existing licence to electrocopying would have to be assessed for
compliance with art.9(2)
of the Berne Convention. The Committee draws attention
to a suggestion by CAL that attribution of the copyright owner be required;
Committee regards this a matter of detail which should be considered in the
context of arrangements for sampling or, alternatively,
record-keeping
prescribed by the licence. The Committee commends for consideration another
suggestion by CAL, that the educational
licence include the proposal in
paragraph 14.27, namely, that a notice be incorporated with the display of a
work stored on a networked
the copyright obligations incurred by printing out the work (Recommendation
The Committee does so on the understanding that implementation would not
be a problem, and subject to the qualification that there
was no opportunity for
the Committee to test the idea with education interests.
Section 40—fair dealing
14.29 The Committee acknowledges that, as noted in the Draft Report and as
already mentioned at paragraph 14.13, a copy of a work
held in an electronic
“copying”, deemed to be a fair
dealing under s.40(2) and (3),
extends to acts of storage on computer database, the Committee draws attention
to the threshold requirement
of any fair dealing under s.40(2) and (3), namely,
that it be “for the purpose of research or study”. The Committee has
noted in Chapter 10 (from paragraph 10.29) the effect of legal opinion on the
limits of “research or study”. The Committee
also refers further to
the interpretation of s.40 by the full Federal Court in
(1982) 42 ALR 549
Haines case)
in which the Court held
that s.40 could not be relied on to exempt from infringement an activity for
which another provision (in the
particular circumstances, the statutory
educational copying licence) was evidently enacted. Further, in the
determination of whether
the copying of the whole or substantial part of a work
under s.40(2) is a fair dealing, the Committee notes that regard is required
be had to, amongst other things, “the purpose and character of the
dealing”. The Committee believes that given this
requirement, the greater
value of a copy in a database compared to a hard copy could be raised as a
consideration weighing against
regarding the making of the former as being a
fair dealing. In that context, the Committee imagines that other relevant
considerations
might be whether the database in which the work was stored was a
stand-alone PC or a photocopier or one accessible to a network of
Given the foregoing, the Committee is not satisfied that there is a strong
enough case for recommending explicit exclusion
of electrocopying from
“copying” as referred to in s.40 and accordingly does not recommend
any change to the section
(Recommendation 2.50).
14.30 In the event that the Committee declined to recommend exclusion of
electrocopying from the scope of s.40, CAL invited the Committee
to recommend
that attribution of the copyright owner be a condition of the availability of
the fair dealing defence. The Committee
sees no reason for singling out
electrocopies for such an additional requirement, and none was given by CAL. CAL
also invited the
Committee to consider recommending an addition to s.40, to the
effect that the subsequent commercial dealing with a copy made by
way of fair
dealing would retrospectively disentitle the maker of the copy to the fair
dealing defence. As to the second suggestion,
the Committee doubts the need for
the amendments suggested by CAL. The determination of whether a particular
dealing in copyright
material is fair within the meaning of the Act should be
determined based on the existing provisions in the Act and in light of the
particular circumstances of each case.
A DISPLAY RIGHT
14.31 It was submitted to the Committee that owners of copyright in works
stored in computer memory should have a right to control
the visual display of
those works. The Draft Report referred to the concern of CAL that access to
works stored in computer memory
on many occasions substituted for the purchase
of those works. For example, database users were able to read articles without
the journals from which they are extracted. Later comments on the
Draft Report from the Hydrographic Service RAN gave other examples
the contention that screen display alone might often be the limit of the use
that users might want to make of a database
and that copyright owners should be
remunerated for that use.
14.32 While the Committee adheres to the view it expressed in the Draft
Report, that the concerns expressed by CAL and the Hydrographic
Service RAN can
be addressed by contractual means, it nonetheless proceeds to consider the
recommendations of the Copyright Convergence
Group (CCG) in relation to a new
transmission right and whether the display of a work, or a substantial portion
of a work, stored
in computer memory amounts to a reproduction of the work, a
public performance of a work or a diffusion service within the meaning
Act (in which case the owners of copyright in the works comprising the database
would have an exclusive right to control the
transmission of their works to
“subscribers” to the database).
A right of transmission to the public
14.33 The Committee notes that the concerns raised by copyright owners of
works included in databases are addressed by at least two
recent reports,
namely, the Copyright Convergence Group’s (CCG) report,
Highways to
Change—Copyright in the New Communications Environment
and the US Green Paper (Draft Report) entitled
Intellectual
Property and the National Information Infrastructure
by the US Assistant
Secretary of Commerce (July 1994). These reports suggest a plurality of ways in
which screen display might be
made subject to the control of the owner of
14.34 The CCG says in its report (paragraph 1.3.4, p.29) that:
There is a need to ensure that certain uses of copyright material which are
provided on a point-to-point basis and which may therefore
not be “to the
public”, such as on-demand services, are nevertheless licensable by
to artificially extend the concept of
the public by means of a definition, the CCG considers that the unauthorised
transmissions
made for a commercial purpose should also infringe a copyright
owner's rights. It therefore recommends that a provision be inserted
Act which deems transmissions of copyright material which are made for a
commercial purpose to be transmissions to the public.
The Government committed itself to implementing the new right of transmission
to the public recommended by the CCG in its cultural
policy statement,
Creative Nation
. The ACC also supported the introduction of such a right,
in its submission on the Draft Report.
14.35 The US Green Paper suggests that the distribution right that copyright
owners have under the US
should be modified to cover
“electronic distribution” of works on database to users of terminals
linked to the database.
There is no right of distribution amongst the rights
presently accorded copyright owners under the Australian Act, although the right
of publication that is among the rights comprising copyright in works, and the
right of owners of copyright in works and other subject
matter to prevent
importation of copies of their materials, which was the subject of an earlier
report by the Committee, effectively
amount to a measure of control over
distribution. In its
Creative Nation
statement, the Government has also
committed itself to consideration of a distribution right at the international
level, and to asking
the Committee, as part of the proposed reference on
simplification of the Act, to consider such a right. In its submission, the ACC
also expressed support for such a right.
14.36 From the foregoing it can be seen that there are at least three ways in
which control by copyright owners can possibly be extended
to screen displays of
a copy of their work stored on database, namely, the public performance right,
the proposed new right of transmission
to the public and a right of distribution
to the public. The Committee notes that each possibility would have different
implications
for the operator of the database and the person causing the screen
display of works stored in the database, if they are two different
14.37 For instance, if screen display were to be made subject to the
distribution right, it would seem to be more appropriate to regard
the database
operator as having exercised that right in allowing the terminal user access to
the database, rather than regard the
latter as having engaged in an act of
distribution. Likewise, if screen display is to be regarded as an act of
transmission, it would
seem more logical to regard the database operator as
responsible, by reason of having put in place the arrangements for screen
by database subscribers, rather than the terminal user having
transmitted the work to himself or herself.
14.38 A modified or expanded performance right may have a different
operation. As noted later by the Committee at paragraph 14.45,
under the present
law, the user of a terminal on which he or she causes a work to be displayed may
be performing the work in public,
depending on who is present at the time. The
possibility of fixing the database operator with liability for publicly
performing a
work which is displayed on a user's terminal by action of the user
is more problematical, particularly if the users of the database
regarded as subscribers to a diffusion service and s.27(2) of the Act applied.
(Section 27(2) deems that causing a work
to be transmitted to subscribers to a
diffusion service is not a performance).
14.39 The Committee has not had the opportunity to give proper consideration
to either the CCG report or the US Government report,
in the time left to it to
finalise and present this report. However, to the limited extent that it has
been able to consider them,
it is reinforced in its view (discussed in full from
paragraph 14.44) that the act of displaying a work on a screen from computer
notes that this view appears to be shared by the ACC.
14.40 As the Government has provisionally committed itself to implementing
the right of transmission to the public recommended by
the CCG, this may offer
the appropriate avenue for enabling owners of copyright in works stored on
over, or at least obtain remuneration for, screen
displays of the works from the databases. Assuming that the database operator,
rather than the individual terminal user, would, by virtue of such a right, be
fixed with responsibility for screen displays by users,
this would appear to be
consistent with the view of the Committee that the practical way for copyright
owners to effectively secure
remuneration for use of their work when stored on
the Committee makes no recommendation regarding a transmission right, it
supports, in principle, its introduction and application
to screen displays.
(Recommendation 2.51).
Is a display on screen a reproduction in a material
14.41 The Committee has considered whether or not a screen display is a
reproduction in a material form of the work or other material
displayed. In this
regard it notes that the definition of material form in s.10(1) provides that
material form:
any form (whether visible or not) of storage from which
the work . . . or a substantial part of the work can be reproduced (emphasis
In its Draft Report, the Committee commented that screen displays were
ephemeral in nature and, for this reason, the Committee did
not regard them as a
form of storage. However, the Committee added that because the definition of
material form is an inclusive and
not an exhaustive one its conclusion in
relation to the definition could not be regarded as conclusive. The Committee
received two
submissions (one from Mr Russell K Evans and the other from Oracle)
commenting on whether or not works displayed on screen would
have first been
stored in computer memory. However, the Committee is concerned here with whether
the display itself on the screen
is a reproduction of the work stored in
computer memory, not whether the work is in a “form of storage”.
14.42 It is clear to the Committee that there remains some doubt whether any
or all screen displays involve a reproduction in material
form. In the Draft
Report the Committee said that while it was arguable that a screen display could
be a reproduction in a material
form of a work stored in computer memory, the
better view, from a policy perspective, was that it should not be regarded as
The AVCC fully supported the Committee in its view. The Committee remains
of this view and affirms the recommendation it made in
the Draft Report that the
Act be amended to make it clear that screen displays do not constitute a
reproduction in a material form
of works stored in computer memory
(Recommendation 2.52). The Committee believes that this recommendation
recognises that the “electronic
browsing” through works stored in an
electronic database is part of the normal use of a such a database and should be
as such, just as the reader of a book in hardcopy is able to browse the
pages without exercising any of the copyright owners’
rights. The
Committee also is of the view that the concerns of copyright owners will be
adequately addressed with the introduction
of a transmission right to the public
which the Government is committed to introducing (see paragraph 14.40).
14.43 In the Draft Report, the Committee also expressed the view that it
should not recommend the introduction of a “display
right” for works
stored in computer memory. ACLIS strongly supported this view and the Committee
sees no reason to change its
view (Recommendation 2.53). The Committee further
recommended that, if its recommendation to extend the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal to licenses for the inclusion of materials on databases was
accepted, then an amendment to the Act should be made requiring
the Copyright
Tribunal to take into account a proposal by a database operator to grant users
screen display access when arbitrating
a dispute under Part VI of the Act. The
Committee reaffirms this recommendation (Recommendation 2.54).
Is a display on screen a public
performance?
14.44 The Committee has also considered the question whether the screen
display of materials contained in a database, or of a work
stored in computer
memory, can be regarded as a public performance of that material. Section
31(1)(a) of the Act provides that, in
the case of literary, dramatic or musical
works, the rights of the copyright owner include the right to perform the work
The owners of copyright in artistic works, however, do not have a
performance right (s.31(1)(b)).
14.45 Section 27(1) of the Act has the effect that a performance includes any
mode of visual or aural presentation, whether by the
operation of wireless
telegraphy apparatus or by any other means, but does not include broadcasting or
cable transmission. The Act
is silent as to the meaning of “in
public”. The Courts have, however, interpreted “public” by
reference to
whether the persons present at the performance were there in a
private, domestic capacity or whether the performance formed part
public, “external” lives. Recently, in
Australasian Performing
Right Association
Commonwealth Bank of Australia
[1992] FCA 609
(1992) 40 FCR 59
Gummow J said
[1992] FCA 609
[1992] FCA 609
The occasion of the performance was the imparting of information by the
employer to its employees and the musical work was used to
facilitate that
process. The audience was brought together by the commercial purpose of the
respondent and their public lives as
employees. These are the most significant
facts which, consistently with the pre 1968 case law, support the
characterisation of the
performance of the work as one ‘in public’
within the meaning of paragraph 31(1)(a)(iii) of the 1968 Act.
By applying the definition of performance and the meaning given to
“public” by the courts, it appears that the screen
materials stored in computer memory can be considered to constitute a public
performance where such display takes place
in a non-domestic context such as at
14.46 Section 27(3) provides that where visual images or sounds are displayed
or emitted by any receiving apparatus to which they
are conveyed (whether or not
by a path made of a material substance) the performance is deemed to be effected
by the operation of
the receiving apparatus (in other words the visual display
unit or monitor). It follows from this that in certain circumstances the
of works stored in computer memory may constitute a public performance by the
person operating the terminal by which the
works accessed in the database are
14.47 In the Draft Report, the Committee recommended that the Act be amended
(paragraph 14.22):
. . . to make it clear that the screen display of work stored in computer
memory does not per se constitute a public performance of
that work. By reason
of the definition of a literary work in the Act this would also apply to
This recommendation was strongly supported by ACLIS, but was queried as being
unnecessary by the ACC and opposed by Mr Lindsay, who
had the impression that
the Committee was recommending that screen displays of works should
amount to a public performance. It was also opposed by CAL, which was
. . . strongly of the opinion that as a matter of policy, screen displays
should be considered to be a public performance”.
CAL argued that (p.7):
With the advent of multi-media works the public performance right may become
most relevant in assisting copyright owners to control
the use of their works.
This view was essentially supported by the Hydrographic Service RAN.
14.48 The Committee acknowledges that there may have been ambiguity in the
way the recommendation was expressed. What was intended—and
what is now
affirmed by the Committee—is that the mere act of calling up onto a
computer terminal screen a work, or portion
of it, from a computer database
should not,
, constitute a public performance of the work and
the Act should be amended to reflect this (Recommendation 2.55). What should
whether that act is a public performance is whether or not it is
carried out “in public”. This is consistent with—indeed
reflects the operation of—s.27, as already noted in paragraph 14.45. The
Committee recognises the seriousness of the possibility
that displays on screen
will become an increasingly frequent form of use of works. However it does not
believe that the existing
right of public performance can be adapted to give a
right to control all acts of displays on screen without distorting the notion
public performance as presently existing and understood in the Act. At most,
some acts of displays on screen of a work, by reason
of the presence of persons
when the act is carried out, will be a public performance of the work and should
be treated in this way
by the Act.
Is a subscription database a diffusion
14.49 Transmission to subscribers to a diffusion service is the exclusive
right of owners of copyright in literary, artistic and musical
cinematograph films, broadcasts and, to a limited extent, artistic works.
Section 26(1) defines such transmission as a transmission
of those copyright
materials, “. . . over wires, or over other paths provided by a material
substance. . .” (which would
appear to include fibre optic cable) “.
. . in the course of a service of distributing broadcast or other matter . . .
premises of subscribers to the service”. While the references to
“broadcast matter” and “premises of subscribers”
suggest that diffusion services contemplate typically cable TV and radio
networks, it may be that some databases serving
subscribers at their offices
would come within the definition. In its Draft Report, the Committee expressed
the view that as many
diffusion service, eg, those in libraries or confined to one business or other
organisation, it would not be appropriate to extend “diffusion
service” beyond its evident focus, ie, cable TV and radio
services. The
Committee notes that the decision of the Federal Court in
[1993] FCA 542
(1993) 27 IPR 357
, referred to the limits on the scope of the
diffusion right. The Committee understands that the decision is being
14.50 In comments on the Draft Report, ACLIS supported the Committee's view
that the diffusion right not be extended beyond its present
effective focus on
cable TV and cable radio services, while CAL and the ACC opposed the Committee's
view. In its report the CCG recommended
that the diffusion right be omitted from
the Act, as a corollary to introduction of a right of transmission to the public
which would
enable copyright owners to control whatever constitutes a diffusion.
The ACC and Mr Lindsay made similar suggestions to those of
the CCG to the
Committee, the ACC adding that artistic works should have the full benefit of
such a right instead of the limited,
indirect right currently enjoyed over
diffusion. In the light of the commitment of the Government to implement the
proposed right
of transmission to the public and the CCG's intention that it
cover “transmissions of copyright material which are made for
a commercial
purpose”, the Committee sees no purpose in considering whether it would be
appropriate, in order to address CAL's
concerns, to review its opposition to
extension of the diffusion right, and it accordingly makes no change to its
recommendation,
while recognising that the CCG’s recommendations, when
implemented, will impact on the diffusion right. (Recommendation 2.56).
THE PUBLICATION RIGHT
14.51 In its comments on the Draft Report, the AVCC suggested that
unpublished works stored on a database that is accessible to a
wide range of
subscribers, such as a bulletin board, might thereby be considered published.
The Committee has elsewhere noted that
what constitutes publication, such as to
amount to an exercise of the publication right comprised in the copyright in
considered by the High Court in
[1990] HCA 58
, in which the Court interpreted s.29 as fixing the time
of publication, rather than defining publication. In its report the CCG
similar expressions of concern, and recommended careful consideration
of the consequences of extending publication to cover transmission
public, in addition to making available copies to the public.
14.52 Given the Government commitment to the principle of a broadly based
right of transmission to the public, this would seem a more
appropriate vehicle
for copyright control over networking of a work from a database, rather than an
extension of the publication
right. However, the Committee agrees with the CCG's
suggestion insofar as the status of a work or other subject matter as either
published or unpublished has significance for the purposes of determining
duration of protection and, in the case of, eg, sound recordings
made in some
overseas countries, the extent of protection.
A RENTAL RIGHT
14.53 In its comments on the Draft Report, RAN submitted that a rental right
should be extended to owners of copyright in all works—not
just computer
programs—and cited an instance of a yacht club purchasing a limited number
of copies of charts in electronic
format and renting them to members. This it
submitted was a valuable exploitation of the database. In recommending in its
Draft Report
that a rental right should be introduced for owners of copyright in
computer programs, the Committee said that its recommendation
. . . should not automatically carry over to other categories of copyright
works or subject matter and that the case for a similar
right in respect of
those other works or subject matter would have to be separately made out.
While the submission just referred to raises the issue, and gives a practical
illustration in support of the case for a rental right
for works, the Committee
feels that in the absence of other submissions this is too narrow a basis for
reaching any firm conclusion.
Accordingly, it draws attention to the matter
without making a recommendation.
THE MEANING OF THE TERM
14.54 The protection of databases was among the issues considered at the
first meeting of the Committee of Experts on a Possible Protocol
to the Berne
Convention held in Geneva from 4 to 8 November 1991. In the memorandum prepared
by the World Intellectual Property Organisation
(WIPO) for that meeting,
consideration was given to the meaning of the term “database”. The
memorandum, at paragraph
40, noted that the term was first used in a narrower
sense, to mean only an “electronic database”. In other words an
aggregate of information systematically arranged and stored in a computer
system. The memorandum commented that it was now clear
that the term should no
longer be connected solely to the element of computer storage. It suggested that
all compilations of information
should be considered databases irrespective of
whether they exist in print, in computer storage, or in some other form.
14.55 Since the publication of the Committee’s Draft Report, the TRIPS
Agreement has been concluded. Article 10(2) of TRIPS
provides that:
Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or other
form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement
of their contents
constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such. Such protection,
which shall not extend to the data
or material itself, shall be without
prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or material itself.
The Committee notes that the scope of application of art.10(2) is wider than
art.2(5) of the Berne Convention, which is directed to
“collections of
literary or artistic works”. It has been pointed out, however, that it is
arguable that the databases
covered by TRIPS art.10(2) may instead be covered by
art.2(1) of the Berne Convention insofar as it refers to “literary and
artistic works” as including:
. . . every production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,
whatever may be the mode or form of its expression, such as
books, pamphlets and
(emphasis added).
14.56 The Committee also notes that on 29 January 1992 the EC Commission (as
it then was) announced its proposal for a directive to
harmonise database
protection throughout the European Union—the EC Directive on Databases. An
amended proposal was submitted
on 4 October 1993. The preamble to the current
amended Directive on Databases provides that the term “database”
be understood to include (paragraph 16):
. . . collections of works, whether literary, artistic, musical or other, or
of other material such as texts, sounds, images, numbers,
facts, data or
combinations of any of these.
However, the scope of protection under the amended Directive is limited to
collections of materials that are arranged, stored and
accessed by electronic
means. The definition of “database” in art.1 includes the materials
necessary for the operation
of the database but excludes any computer program
used in the making or operation of the database. The amended Directive is
to operate without prejudice to the rights subsisting in such
collections as compilations within the meaning of art.2(5) of the Berne
Convention.
14.57 In the light of, particularly, art.10(2) of TRIPS, the
Committee’s view is that the meaning of the term “database”
should not be confined to collections of works and materials stored
electronically. There is no definition of the term in the Act
and the Committee
has not received any submissions on the scope of the term. However, it does not
consider that there is any reason
why, from a copyright perspective, different
principles should apply to either the materials collected or the collection of
as a whole, merely because of the particular material form in which
those materials are stored. Accordingly, for the purpose of the
discussion in
this report the Committee has not drawn any distinction between different types
of databases. The Committee acknowledges
this means its conclusions will apply
to traditional hard-copy databases, databases stored in computer memory and
in other forms of storage such as floppy discs, tape streams
and CD–ROM which may not be considered to be true forms of computer
CURRENT PROTECTION OF DATABASES STORED IN COMPUTER
Act protects compilations as literary
14.58 As mentioned in paragraph 14.06, one of the issues for consideration is
the protection of collections of works stored in computer
memory (databases).
The definition of a literary work in s.10(1) of the Act provides, in part, that
the term literary work includes:
(a) a table or compilation, expressed in words, figures or symbols (whether
or not in a visible form).
Prior to the
, the definition read
“literary work” includes a written table or compilation.
The explanatory memorandum for the 1984 amendments to the Act makes it clear
that the definition was amended to ensure that tables
or compilations should not
be denied protection simply because they were stored in an invisible form in
computer memory.
14.59 In its submission CAL suggested that the definition of a literary work
should be amended to include a specific reference to
computer databases. The
AIIA also suggested that the definition should be clarified to specify the
elements necessary for a database
to be a literary work. It submitted that the
definition of a compilation in the US
could be used.
That definition provides that a compilation is:
a work formed by the collection and assembling of pre-existing materials or
of data that are selected, co-ordinated or arranged in
such a way that the
resultant work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.
14.60 The Committee considers that the meaning of the word compilation in the
Australian Act, as used in paragraph (a) of the definition
of literary work,
would ordinarily include a literary work constructed of materials collected from
different sources. In his book
The Law of Intellectual Property
Law Book Company, Sydney) Professor Ricketson notes that the term compilation is
very broad and might include (p.98, paragraph
. . . a dictionary, an almanac, a gazette, an anthology or selection of other
non-copyright works or factual information, a catalogue
or a news report.
Accordingly, the Committee is of the opinion that the ordinary meaning of
compilation is broad enough to include databases which are
collections of works or other materials gathered from different sources. The
Committee notes that the Copyright (World
Trade Organisation Amendments) Bill
1994, which was introduced in Parliament in late 1994 to implement
Australia’s obligations
under the TRIPS Agreement, does not include any
amendment to implement art.10(2) (referred to at paragraph 14.55), inferring
the Government has taken the view that the obligations under art.10(2) are
already effected by the Act as it stands.
14.61 The scope of copyright protection for compilations was considered in
the US by the Supreme Court in the case of
Feist Publications Inc
Rural Telephone Service Co Inc
(1991) 20 IPR 129
Feist case)
that case Rural Telephone (Rural), a public utility, provided telephone services
to north–west Kansas. Each year, as required
under State regulations,
Rural issued an updated telephone directory to its subscribers. Feist
Publications (Feist) did not provide
telephone services. It published a
telephone directory for a geographical area which included some of the area
serviced by Rural.
To compile its directory, Feist’s practice was to
obtain a licence from the telephone companies operating in the area covered
its directory. Rural refused to grant Feist a licence, so Feist used
Rural’s listing without its consent. (Of the 46,878
listings in
Feist’s directory 1309 were identical to those in Rural’s
directory).
14.62 Feist conceded that Rural’s directory was subject to copyright.
However, it denied infringement, contending that it did
not copy anything that
was original to Rural but only copied facts reported by Rural. These it
submitted existed regardless of their
being recorded in Rural’s directory.
The Court considered only whether Rural had selected, co-ordinated or arranged
the uncopyrightable
facts in an original way. The Court held (p.142):
This is “selection” of a sort, but it lacks the modicum of
creativity necessary to transform mere selection into copyrightable
expression.
In other words, the Court found that Rural had not satisfied the test for the
minimum standard for originality. Accordingly, copyright
protection was denied
to its directory.
14.63 In order to be protected in Australia under the Act, a work must have
entailed expenditure of a sufficient degree of labour
and skill in the selection
and arrangement of the material comprising the work before it will be considered
to be an original work.
It is the combination of the labour and skill expended
in compiling the database that is protected, not the underlying material or
information which, depending on its nature, may or may not attract copyright
protection. The Committee notes that the standard for
originality appears to be
quite low under Australian law. This was also noted by Mr Lindsay. For example,
with lists and tables of
factual material there can often be little if any
element of original composition by the compiler in setting out the information.
What originality may subsist in the work will be the skill and labour found
solely in the way the compiler has presented and arranged
the information. The
test is whether the compiler has imposed some sort of order upon the material,
ie, whether an element of coherence
has been introduced which is not otherwise
found in the mass of materials collected.
14.64 In its submission, IBM commented that the present Act provides adequate
protection for databases and that the protection to
be afforded in each case
should be determined on general principles. In its Draft Report the Committee
expressed the opinion that
the definition of a literary work, as amended in
1984, was broad enough to include computer databases, ie, tables or compilations
of works or information stored in computer memory. For the reasons given above,
the Committee agreed with IBM and was not persuaded
that there was any need to
amend the definition of literary work to specifically include a reference to
computer databases or to
define compilations ACLIS and the ACC agreed with that
conclusion. Accordingly the Committee adheres to the opinion it expressed
Draft Report that no amendment is necessary to the definition of literary work
to include a reference to computer databases
or to define compilation
(Recommendation 2.57).
OTHER ISSUES CONCERNING DATABASES
Term of protection
14.65 The Committee is of the view that databases should be protected for the
same period as other literary works. As art.2(5) of
the Berne Convention
specifically extends protection, as literary and artistic works, to at least
some compilations coming within
the definition in the Australian Act, it is not
consistent with its international obligations for Australia to consider varying
term of protection from life of the author plus fifty years. The Committee
notes that TRIPS art.10(2) does not require databases,
to which it applies, to
be protected as literary works—as art 10(1) requires in the case of
computer programs—and art.12
prescribes a minimum term of fifty years for
protection of a work (other than a photograph or work of applied art) for which
life of the author is not the prescribed duration. While it might be
possible to prescribe a fifty year term for some databases and
compliance with the Berne Convention and the TRIPS Agreement, the Committee is
certainly not persuaded that it should seriously
entertain the idea of reducing
the existing duration of protection of any class of databases already protected
under the Act and
does not recommend any change to the Act with respect to the
term of protection (Recommendation 2.58).
Dynamic databases
14.66 It has been suggested that the duration of copyright protection for
electronic databases which are being constantly updated
is potentially eternal.
The Committee notes that for any published database there will be a time when
the first edition of the database
is made. This will be the time from which the
period of copyright protection will commence. Determining that time will be a
of fact which can only be answered having regard to the circumstances
in each case. The addition of information to a database would
not, in the
Committee’s view, automatically give rise to the creation of a new edition
of the database unless there was a sufficiently
substantial change to the
protection should subsist. Insubstantial
additions would not give rise to a new
edition. In order to determine whether or not a new work has been created,
consideration must
be given to the quality and quantity of the material added to
the database and how the author of the database has incorporated that
The Committee notes that in some cases the material added to a database may
itself qualify for separate copyright protection.
14.67 In its Draft Report, the Committee was of the view that the questions
when copyright in a database commenced and the identification
of the period for
which it subsisted in a database were questions to be determined on the basis of
the evidence in individual cases
and that, accordingly, no legislative action
was required. In his comments on the Draft Report, Mr Lindsay expressed concern
difficulty of determining the duration of protection of a
“dynamic” database that is being constantly updated, and asked
producer “is to be penalised for supplying a database that is continually
being upgraded”.
14.68 The Committee acknowledges the potential difficulty in determining the
term of protection of a “dynamic database”,
but believes that, as
noted in paragraph 14.66 above, at some stage the cumulative effect of the
constant updating will result in
the view being taken that a new edition, ie, a
new work, had come into being at that stage, with duration being calculated
accordingly.
This problem is not confined to databases, although it may manifest
itself more in their case. The Committee notes that a new play
being performed
for the first time may be repeatedly adjusted as rehearsals progress—not
just lines, but whole scenes may be
written in or out—with the result that
it may be difficult to determine when the work was completed and, thus, from
when duration
of protection commences.
14.69 The Committee notes that the Federal Court addressed this issue in
relation to the copyright in working drawings for toy building
Interlego AG
Croner Trading Pty Limited
[1992] FCA 624
(1992) 39 FCR 348
A number of amendments were made to drawings in which copyright
subsisted. The court held that a new copyright in the altered drawings
with the effect that a new copyright was conferred on the drawings, from the
period commencing on the date the new drawings
came into existence ie, were
altered. The court disagreed with the decision of the Privy Council in
Tyco Industries Inc
[1988] UKPC 3
[1989] AC 217
where the Privy
Council had, on precisely the same facts, reached the opposite conclusion.
14.70 The duration of copyright in databases has always depended on their
authorship. Accordingly, the need to determine their authorship
is not new. In
this context there are two main issues. First, where the database is a
compilation of works, is there sufficient originality
in the compilation to
found authorship in it as a work, independently of the copyright in the works
comprising the compilation? Or,
where the database is a collection of facts or
figures, such as a directory or timetable, is there sufficient originality to
authorship in it as an original literary work—or would originality
be denied as in the
? Secondly, whatever the nature of the
compilation, is the work of a person who has contributed to the compilation such
as to entitle
that person to be treated as the author or a joint author of the
compilation?
14.71 The spectrum of compilations from encyclopedias at one extreme to
directories of factual information at the other has long existed
form. Where the component parts are of sufficient import for recognition as
independent literary works, compilations will
usually have required a contract
between the authors and the person organising the compilation. At the other
extreme, individuals
will be employed to gather and organise factual information
which requires no originality. Large databases may be compiled by a number
individuals. As already mentioned, a sufficient degree of labour and skill must
have been expended in the selection and arrangement
of the materials that make
up a database before it will be considered to be an original work. It follows
that the person or persons
who contribute this skill and labour should be
regarded as the author or authors of the database. In the Committee’s view
mere contribution of labour to the creation of a database should not be
sufficient to entitle a person to claim authorship, just
as the work of a
stenographer in typing dictation of a novel does not entitle the stenographer to
co-authorship of the novel. If
this principle is applied, people who merely
enter data collected by others into computer memory would not be regarded as
14.72 The determination of the authorship of large databases stored on
computer memory, difficult or practically impossible as it
may be, is not a
problem peculiar to computer databases or other large works stored in that
medium to which many have contributed
in varying degrees. Indeed, in Chapter 8,
paragraph 8.06, the Committee noted that the same problem occurred with the
of computer programs. That being so, and as the reference to the
Committee does not extend to a general review of the law governing
authorship, the Committee does not feel that it should recommend a change in the
law regarding the authorship of works because
they happen to be created and
stored in computer memory (Recommendation 2.59). In addition, because the Berne
Convention requires
protection to extend to all those who are joint authors of
literary and artistic works, there may be limits on seeking to vary the
law, if that were thought desirable.
14.73 The Committee notes that determining ownership of copyright in a work
of many joint authors also has the potential to be difficult
to the point of
being practically impossible. However, the Committee did not receive any
submissions concerning the ownership of
because the Act provides the opportunity for a person controlling or
coordinating the preparation
or maintenance of a database to secure ownership of
and further provides that, in the absence of contractual arrangements to the
contrary, such person has copyright in all inputs by
his or her employees. Given
the confines of the Committee’s reference to computerised databases, and
in the absence of submissions
critical of the present law, the Committee
reaffirms its view that the mere fact of the storage on computer memory of a
does not, of itself, warrant or require any change to provisions
regarding copyright ownership (Recommendation 2.60).
PROTECTION OF NON-ORIGINAL DATABASES
14.74 As the Committee mentioned in paragraph 14.04, there may be situations
where a considerable amount of time, money and effort
has been expended in
creating a comprehensive database which, under the present copyright regime, may
not be protectable because
the selection or arrangement of its contents are
insufficiently original. Nonetheless, in such cases those who created the
will have an understandably strong desire to protect the considerable
economic investment expended in creating and maintaining the
also be concerned to protect the database from unauthorised copying and
manipulation of the material contained
in it. Ensuring such protection would be
considerably more difficult if the database were not protected as an original
literary work.
If the decision in the
(paragraphs
14.61–14.62) were followed by Australian courts there would be some cases
in which it would be difficult to maintain
that publicly available facts as
stored in computer databases would have sufficient originality to attract
This could be expected to have significant implications
for businesses providing information stored in computer memory.
The EC Amended Directive on Databases
14.75 As mentioned in paragraph 14.56 the EC Commission announced its
proposal for a directive on database protection in January 1992
and released an
amended proposal for the Directive in October 1993. In essence the amended
Directive on Databases created a new right
of “unfair extraction” in
both non-original databases (ie, those not protected by copyright) and databases
by copyright. The amended Directive did not affect copyright
protection for original databases. Under the amended Directive the maker
from that database, of its contents, in whole
or in substantial part, for
commercial purposes irrespective of the eligibility of the database for
protection under copyright. The
right to prevent “unfair extraction”
runs from the date of creation and expires 10 years from the date when the
is first lawfully made available to the public. It proposed that
insubstantial changes to the contents of a database would not extend
original period of protection of the database.
14.76 The need for a right to prevent unfair extraction from a database was
not raised in the Committee’s Issues Paper and the
Committee had not
received any submissions on it prior to releasing its Draft Report. This being
so, and given the Committee’s
conclusion as to the wide scope of existing
protection under the Act for databases the Committee did not, in its Draft
Report, make
a recommendation regarding possible adoption of the approach in the
EC Directive on Databases, stating that it would consider this
issue further in
the light of any comments it received in response to the Draft Report.
14.77 The Committee received several submissions commenting on the possible
adoption of an unfair extraction right applicable to non-original
Evans supported adoption of such a right, if it was stated not to attract the
exemption provided for in
Trade Practices Act 1974
Believing that the “effort involved in converting a non-original database
into electronic form is worth protecting”,
the Law Council thought that
electronic non-original databases should be protected against electronic, but
not hardcopy, reproduction,
for a considerably shorter duration than protection
for literary works. Mr Lindsay, while commending a
sui generis
protection because it could be made to fit the circumstances of such databases,
noted constitutional difficulties with such
an approach and suggested that, as
the EC Directive on Databases had not been finalised, an amendment to the Act in
Australia might
be premature at this stage. The ACC queried whether the
extension of protection of published editions recommended in Chapter 15 might
protect non-original databases. Messrs Houghton and Reid–Smith favoured
consideration of following the EC model.
14.78 The Committee believes that there is merit in Mr Evans’
suggestion, both as to adoption of an unfair extraction right
and as to the
application of Part IV of the
Trade Practices Act
, since what would be
protected under such a right is a mass of data, not a form of expression. The
Committee queries the limitation
proposed by the Law Council. It seems to the
Committee that extraction from the database whether in hardcopy or in electronic
would be equally injurious to the creator of the database. The Committee
endorses Mr Lindsay's concerns regarding the constitutional
powers available to
make provision for non-original databases, while noting that the
Layouts Act 1989
was enacted, notwithstanding that Australia had not adhered
to the Washington Treaty, which the Act was intended to implement. Of
most of that Treaty plus some additional obligations have now been incorporated
in the TRIPS Agreement.
14.79 Lastly in relation to published edition copyright, the Committee
believes that while the published edition copyright, amended
as recommended in
Chapter 15, would effectively protect published databases, it would not do so
where the database had not been published.
While not having been informed on the
subject, the Committee is prepared to accept that many commercially valuable
not be “published” in the copyright sense or, if
intended to be published, would not have the protection of the published
14.80 Notwithstanding the support evident in the submissions for the
introduction of an unfair extraction right, the Committee is
of the view that a
decision on adoption of such a right should be deferred until consideration has
been given to the final form of
the EC Directive on Databases and accordingly it
recommends further review of this issue bearing in mind developments in relation
to this Directive (Recommendation 2.61).
NEW KINDS OF COMPUTERISED WORKS
14.81 In its Draft Report, the Committee referred to a United States Office
of Technology Assessment 1992 publication entitled
Finding a balance:
computer software, intellectual property and the challenge of intellectual
. The Committee noted several new issues: that the report raised for
consideration:
• First, given that the law recognised several different kinds of works
and some multi-media “subject matter other than
works”, eg, films,
could computer-based multi-media productions be accommodated in any of the
existing definitions, or was
there a need for a new “subject matter other
than a work”?;
• Next, was a new licensing regime required to enable makers of
multi-media productions to use, for example, small parts of hundreds
• Additionally, was the definition of “public performance”
clear in relation to the use of a multi-media production
in a public place?;
• Finally, were hypertexts, consisting of objects—words,
paragraphs, pictures, sounds—interconnected by “links”
protected by copyright? If another person created a different set of links using
the same objects, was this a new work, or a work
which infringed copyright in
the previous hypertext?
14.82 The Committee did not receive any submissions prior to the Draft Report
concerning new kinds of works, and therefore invited
comments on these and other
issues relating to new forms of works. In response to this invitation the Law
Council opposed any additional
protection for hypertexts and, in the absence of
any other submissions, the Committee makes no recommendation on additional or
protection for hypertexts (Recommendation 2.62).
Multi-media
14.83 In its submission on the Draft Report, Australian Pay TV Pty Ltd (APTV)
so defined the nature of multi-media as to leave the
Committee with the strong
impression that a multi-media production is essentially a collective production
combining a number of items
of copyright material comprising literary and
artistic works, sound recordings and cinematographic films, in a way comparable
books comprising both literary and artistic works. (Perhaps the novelty
musical greeting cards comprising artistic and literary works
and a sound
recording are a form of multi-media that preceded the CD–ROM, silent films
that included text interposed between
sequences of moving pictures are an even
earlier example, and of course films and videos combining moving pictures and
the most familiar form.) However, following its definition of
multi-media, APTV proceeded to list examples of multi-media that included
“interactive broadcast”, “on-line video libraries” and
“electronic publishing of newspapers”,
which the Committee
understands might not contain all the elements included in the suggested
definition.
14.84 Moving pictures were in the course of time accorded protection as a new
form of copyright subject matter distinct from the individual
photographic works
and, in the case of sound films, the sound track of the film. Is a multi-media
production of such a distinctive
nature that it warrants being given the status
of a new form of copyright subject matter? Insofar as a multi-media production
of moving pictures and accompanying recorded sounds, it seems to come
within the definition, in s.10(1) of the Act, of cinematograph
film which is
defined as:
. . . the aggregate of the visual images embodied in an article or thing so
as to be capable by the use of the article or thing:
(a) of being shown as a moving picture; or
(b) of being embodied in another article or thing by the use of which it can
and includes the aggregate of sounds embodied in a sound-track associated
with such visual images, bearing in mind that “sound-track”
turn defined, in part, as:
in relation to visual images forming part of a cinematograph film, means:
(a) the part of any article or thing, being an article or thing in which
those visual images are embodied, in which sounds are embodied
It does not seem to the Committee that the inclusion of text and still images
in a multi-media production serves to deprive it of
protection, as a
cinematograph film, any more than does the inclusion of credits or other
narrative, text or still images sometimes
seen in movies.
14.85 It seems to the Committee that what might be regarded as setting
multi-media productions apart from traditional cinematograph
film are two
features. First, there is the much talked-of facility, via the computer program
with which the moving pictures, text,
sound and images are associated on the
CD–ROM or other medium, for the user to manipulate these works and subject
interact with them. Second, there is the collective nature of the
multi-media production—the very combining of moving and still
text and sound—in the one composite production.
14.86 As to the interactive nature of multi-media, does this give rise to an
unprecedented copyright issue? The possibility and practice
of editing and
dubbing films is as old as silent and sound cinematography, and it does not seem
that interacting with a multi-media
production is different in essence from
editing a celluloid film, so much as making it infinitely more possible to
modify the multi-media
production in an infinite variety of ways. The question
whether a new work or other subject matter has been created by the modifier
the consequences of adapting the production modified are not new issues. As to
the collective nature of multi-media, the Committee
recalls that there are
plenty of examples of films and TV programs that have consisted of collages of
moving and still pictures with
accompanying sound (a well-known recent example
is the TV series on the US Civil War based substantially on contemporary
photographs,
supplemented by moving picture sequences shot for the series or
otherwise in recent times).
14.87 The APTV’s submission also described the technique for creating
multi-media which uses a computer to assemble the component
elements comprising
a multi-media production. The Committee does not believe—if indeed it was
suggested—that the use
of a computer as described to assemble a
multi-media production is a reason for treating the result as a new form of work
subject matter, any more than the use of a word processor to write a
novel or a computer to compose a musical piece is a cause for
regarding the
result as other than a literary or musical work, as the case may be. In general,
the foregoing analysis leads the Committee
to the conclusion that the case for
new or additional protection of multi-media as a new form of copyright material
has not been
made out. In its submission on the Draft Report, the Law Council
came to the same conclusion. The Committee also notes that the CCG
briefly considered the position of multi-media expressed the opinion that it was
not immediately apparent why a new category
of subject matter other than works
was necessary to extend copyright protection to such materials. Having also
considered this matter,
the Committee does not recommend the creation of a new
category of protection for multi-media (Recommendation 2.63(a)). That said,
Committee does accept that it is stretching the generally understood meaning of
“cinematograph film” to apply that
term to a multi-media production,
and recommends consideration as did the CCG of the adoption of a more
appropriate alternative,
such as “audiovisual work” which could
encompass cinematograph films and multi-media materials (Recommendation
14.88 The APTV submission noted, without criticism, that the computer program
by which a multi-media production is used is protected
as a literary work. Nor
did it appear to have a problem with the protection of component elements as
films, sound recordings and
works, as the case may be. However, APTV felt that
was uncertain, giving the impression that the multi-media production consisted
of the very act of displaying or transmitting the
component parts to receivers.
The Committee believes that there is some confusion here between the multi-media
production as a “film”,
and the use of that production. There seems
no reason to depart from the consistent policy of the Act of withholding
protection from
works that are not reduced to a material form. As to display on
a TV receiver of a broadcast of a multi-media production, the Committee
that just as a prerecorded TV broadcast is a film, although made purely for
putting to air, rather than cinema release,
so the assembly of film, text,
pictures and sounds prior to their transmission as a composite entity would
constitute the creation
of a film. If the act of transmission amounted to a
broadcast, that would give rise to broadcast copyright, and the multi-media
production,
as a copyright film, would be protected against unauthorised
broadcasting. As to transmission of multi-media that does not amount
broadcast and other screen displays, these are covered by the discussion of
screen display (see paragraph 14.31 above).
SECTION 35(4)—OWNERSHIP OF COPYRIGHT IN THE
PRINT MEDIA
14.89 In its Draft Report, the Committee summarised the submissions it had
received concerning the operation of s.35(4) as it applies
to the use of
journalists’ articles in computerised databases and by media monitoring
organisations. It also noted that the
then Attorney-General had made a separate
reference to the Committee in 1992 asking it to inquire into and report on
whether or not
s.35(4) should be modified or repealed. The Committee left
resolution of whether there should be any change in s.35(4) in relation
electronic news databases to its consideration of the Attorney-General’s
separate reference on s.35(4). On 22 April 1994
the Committee presented tits
report on that reference entitled
Journalists' Copyright
to the Minister for Justice, the Hon. Duncan Kerr. As that report deals fully
with the views of the Committee on s.35(4) in relation
to news databases, the
Committee refers readers to that report, rather than repeating its views
SECTION 183—GOVERNMENT USE OF COPYRIGHT
MATERIALS HELD ON DATABASE
14.90 In its submission on the Draft Report, CAL advocated the placing of
“quantitative limits on the proportion of a work that
can be included in a
report (paragraphs 10.119 and
10.122), the Committee has recommended limiting
the circumstances in which computer programs can be copied under s.183. The
feels that a distinction can be drawn between computer programs and
other works in this regard. As the Committee has noted several
times, computer
programs are a utilitarian item, used to run machines and not to be read for
information or entertainment. Because
custom software is a readily obtainable
tool, the Committee thought that the right of governments to copy programs under
s.183 should
be limited to circumstances in which the particular program needed
is not readily available. The variety of other copyright materials
governments might want to make use of—in particular, to scan onto database
for diffusion to those who need to know or
to assemble with other
materials—is almost infinite.
14.91 The Committee does not feel that the context of this reference is the
one in which it should make what would amount to a broad
recommendation for
cutting down the scope of s.183. Having acknowledged the greater value to the
user of holding a copy of a work
on database compared to holding a hard copy,
the Committee feels that this can be taken into account in the discharge of the
that s.183 imposes on governments to agree on payment for use of
the rate of
payment. CAL also suggested reform of the method of payment for use under s.183.
The Committee understands that the Government
has made a decision to enact
reforms to s.183, which are currently being drafted for presentation to
Parliament. Accordingly it is
unnecessary for the Committee to make any
recommendation in relation to s.183 as it applies to government use of copyright
held on database (Recommendation 2.64).
Published Edition Copyright
15.01 As mentioned in paragraph 1.03, the Committee was given an additional
term of reference in January 1991 to inquire whether there
is any need to amend
(the Act) to take account of electronic
and mechanical means of entering print material onto a database with capacity to
copies of that material.
15.02 Section 88 of the Act provides:
For the purposes of this Act, unless the contrary intention appears,
dramatic, musical
or artistic work or of two or more literary, dramatic, musical or artistic
works, is the exclusive right to make,
by a means that includes a photographic
process, a reproduction of the edition.
“Photograph” is defined in s.10(1)as:
. . . a product of photography or of a process similar to photography, other
than an article or thing in which visual images forming
part of a cinematograph
film have been embodied, and includes a product of xerography, and
“photographic” has a corresponding
15.03 The need for a published edition copyright was considered in the UK in
Report of the Departmental Committee on International Copyright
and also in the 1952
Report of the Copyright Committee
(Gregory Report,
Cmnd. 8662). In Australia the matter was considered by the Copyright Law Review
Committee in 1959 (the Spicer Committee).
The case for the enactment of a
provision protecting published edition copyright is set out in the 1952 Gregory
Report (UK) which
states that the reason for seeking protection for
typographical arrangements was (paragraph 3.06 ):
. . . so that a particular edition of a literary or musical work printed by
or for a publisher could not be directly and exactly copied
by an unscrupulous
competitor by photo–lithography or similar means. . . once a book or an
orchestral score has been printed,
it is now possible by photographic processes
to produce reprints quickly and, compared with the costs involved in
cheaply. If the literary or musical work printed is in
owner, and this would also be the case if the edition includes original artistic
works in copyright. But if the work printed is itself
out of copyright, there is
nothing to prevent the unscrupulous competitor from copying the work
photographically and so benefiting
unfairly from the work of the original
15.04 The report goes on to note, in paragraph 3.07, that the work done by a
publisher in bringing out an edition of a literary or
musical work is analogous
to the work which is done by the manufacturers of sound recordings. Both spend
time and effort making the
original work available in a convenient and
attractive form to the public irrespective of whether the underlying work is in
or not. The 1959 Report of the Spicer Committee (
Report of the
Committee appointed by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth to Consider What
Alterations Are Desirable In The Copyright
Law Of The Commonwealth
Commonwealth Government Printer, Canberra, 1959) recommended that a copyright in
typographical arrangements should be enacted. Section
88 of the Act gives effect
to this recommendation.
15.05 The Committee received three submissions in relation to this issue, one
from Apple Computer Australia Pty Limited (Apple), another
from the Australian
Book Publishers Association (ABPA) and the third from Davies Ryan De Boos
Solicitors (DRD). The Apple submission
(6 June 1989) outlined some of the
processes made available by technological advances that could impact on
published edition copyright.
15.06 Apple’s submission distinguished two processes by which text and
images can be transferred to computer memory. One such
process identified was
that of scanning, referred to in paragraph 14.09, in connection with computer
similar to conventional photocopying, whereby
digital information is created and stored by means of reflected and absorbed
from the printed page that is scanned. The result is that a pictorial
image of the scanned page (like a digital photograph) can be
reproduced from the
stored information but the information/data itself cannot be used, for example,
in word processing. The other
more advanced process is known as “optical
character recognition” (OCR). OCR uses a similar process to that of
but a computer program analyses the scanned information from the page,
converts the letters to digital form and stores them in computer
memory from
which they can be displayed on a screen or printed out in hard copy form.
15.07 The ABPA submitted that there is some ambiguity whether s.88 only
applies where the reproduction involves a photographic process
or whether a
photographic process is but one of the processes by which the edition may be
reproduced. The ABPA submitted that the
section should be amended to clarify
that it is not limited to reproductions by photographic processes and suggested
that this would
most simply be achieved by deleting the words “by a means
that includes a photographic process” from the section.
15.08 It is not clear to the Committee whether either scanning or OCR include
a “photographic process”. Both appear to
rely on information being
created through the reflection and absorption of light which, at a basic level
of abstraction, is a process
similar to photography. However, the information
gained by scanning, for example, a page of a book, is stored in digital form. It
is only when this digital information is converted and printed out in hard copy
that a reproduction of the published edition can
be considered to have been
made, and then only if the material has not been reformatted, eg, by using a
different type face. The
storing of the information gained by scanning and OCR
and the display of that information on a screen would not, it appears, amount
a reproduction of the published edition.
15.09 In considering the implications for published edition copyright of the
possibilities offered by scanning onto a computer memory
and printing out from
that memory, the Committee believes that there are two issues to be addressed.
First, what is encompassed by
the word ”reproduce” in s.88 and,
second, whether the immediately succeeding words “by a means that includes
photographic process” limit the means of reproduction covered by the
published edition copyright to such process.
THE MEANING OF “REPRODUCE” IN SECTION
15.10 “Reproduction” has a broad meaning under the Act in
relation to works. For example, s.21(1) deems a literary, dramatic
work to have been “reproduced” in a material form if a record or
film is made of the work. The Committee notes,
by way of contrast, that where
“copy” is used in the Act it has a more specific meaning of a
duplicate. For example one
of the exclusive rights of owners of copyright in
sound recordings, films and broadcasts in ss.85–87 is to make
of their materials.
15.11 However, when applying “reproduction” to a published
edition, which is a subject matter other than a work, regard
must be had to its
different nature from that of “works”. Since a literary work
consists of a form of expression of ideas
and can be reduced to a material form
in a variety of ways —in manuscript, print, sound recording and computer
is understandable that under the Act it can be
“reproduced” in a variety of ways. On the other hand an edition of a
or works seems necessarily confined to one format. Under s.29, an edition
becomes a published edition when “reproductions”
of the edition have
been supplied to the public. This seems to lend weight to the inference that
“reproduction” such
as is the exclusive right comprising published
edition copyright is intended to be confined to exact copies (Professor
The Law of Intellectual Property
, 1984 at paragraph 9.151
suggests as well that the right is to make “near exact” copies. The
Committee also notes that
the Gregory Report (UK) at paragraph 3.08 stated that
the protection they recommended should relate only to exact copying by
photo–lithographic
or similar means).
“BY A MEANS THAT INCLUDES A PHOTOGRAPHIC
15.12 As regards the second issue, the Committee indicated in the Draft
Report that it is inclined to the view that the words “by
a means that
includes a photographic process” are words of limitation on the manner of
making a reproduction of an edition.
If the intention of s.88 was to stop unfair
competition with a published edition occasioned by free-riding on the labour and
outlaid by the publisher in typesetting the edition, the Committee
presumes that published edition copyright was not intended to
production of an exact copy of a published edition (a “reproduction”
of it) ie, by applying the same labour
and skill as that employed by the
publisher of the original edition thus reproduced. The second publisher would
have incurred similar
production costs to the first, and there would be fair
competition between two versions of the same work. (Of course, if the later
edition extended to copying all aspects of the original edition, including the
original publisher’s imprint, that would give
rise to actions against the
publisher of the later edition for passing off and/or misleading and deceptive
conduct). If a contrary
view were taken, that is, that the words mean in effect
“by any means, including a photographic process”, the Committee
questions why the words were included at all.
15.13 Proceeding on that basis, the bare act of scanning onto database, while
it may include a photographic process as defined in
the Act, ought not of itself
constitute a reproduction of the published edition. The work and edition as
captured on the database
look nothing like the published edition. However, if
scanning onto a database is but an intermediate step to printing hard copy from
the database which reproduces, ie, identical to or closely resembles, the
edition scanned, then that seems to achieve the same result
as the copying of an
edition by a means that includes a photographic process, and would appear to be
the sort of activity intended
to be made the subject of control by the owner of
the published edition copyright.
15.14 Having regard to the limited nature of the published edition right ie.
the protection of the published arrangement or layout
of the work the Committee
can see no reason for constraining the copyright owners’ right in the
manner the interpretation of
s.88 in paragraph 15.12 would suggest. Copyright
owners should have the right to protect the published arrangement of the work
unauthorised copying regardless of the process used to make the copy.
Therefore s.88 should unambiguously provide that the copyright
in a published
edition is the exclusive right to make a facsimile copy of that arrangement.
Accordingly, the Committee recommends
that the words “by a means that
includes a photographic process, a reproduction” in s.88 be deleted and
replaced with
the words “a facsimile copy” (Recommendation 2.65(a))
OTHER ISSUES
Reformatted editions
15.15 A further question which arises is whether the printing of a hard copy
of the scanned edition from the database should be subject
to the control of the
edition copyright owner if the edition was reformatted before being printed out
from the database? If a different
adopted, so that the print-out of the scanned edition did not look the same as
original edition should this be regarded as a reproduction? The Committee
takes the view that if the resulting edition is not a
“reproduction”,
ie, is not an exact or near exact copy, of the
original edition then it should not be subject to the copyright in the original
To have so altered the original edition that the new edition is not a
“reproduction” in the sense just used, the publisher
edition would have exercised labour and skill to effect those alterations. While
this might not be a very demanding task,
because of the capacity of facilities
for manipulating databases, the Committee is mindful that such technology is
available to all
publishers now. Thus it is open to any publisher of an original
edition to use computer technology to scan an old edition of, eg,
that s.92(2) denies copyright to an edition
that “reproduces a previous
edition”. So if another publisher did the same to the edition thus
created, that second publisher
would likely expend no less skill and labour and
effort making his edition sufficiently different from the firstmentioned edition
as did the publisher of that edition in deriving it from the old edition.
Possible repeal or amendment of published edition
15.16 The submission by DRD was made on behalf of one of its clients who
operates a media monitoring service which provides copies
of clippings from
newspapers, magazines and other periodicals to its customers. That service
operates pursuant to a licence it has
negotiated with the Copyright Agency
Limited (CAL). DRD claimed that its client was experiencing difficulties
continuing its service
because of the overlap of the published edition copyright
with that subsisting in the underlying works it copies. Certain publishers
threatening to assert their published edition copyright against the service
notwithstanding the licence to reproduce given by
15.17 Accordingly, DRD asked, on behalf of its client, that the Committee
• whether the grant of published edition copyright can now be justified
given the passage of time and the technological developments
since the 1952
Gregory Report (UK) recommended the grant of such protection;
• whether published edition copyright should be limited to the case
where the work or works comprised in such edition do not
enjoy copyright
protection; and
• whether provision should be made for the grant to media monitoring
services of compulsory licences to reproduce published editions
on payment of
equitable remuneration
DRD also suggested as an alternative that a statutory licence scheme could be
introduced for the reproduction of literary, dramatic
and artistic works for the
purpose of dissemination through a media monitoring service.
15.18 The Committee does not feel that its terms of reference in relation to
the issue of published edition copyright are sufficiently
broad to justify its
consideration of the desirability or otherwise of retaining s.88 in the Act.
Indeed the terms of reference of
the Committee in relation to s.88 are premised
on the need to ensure the continuing adequacy of the provision. For this reason
Committee does not make any specific recommendation concerning the retention
15.19 In relation to the second point that is raised in the DRD submission
the Committee has some sympathy for the position that the
media monitoring
service finds itself in and understands the reasoning behind the suggestion.
However, it seems to the Committee
that the rationale for the granting of a
published edition copyright applies equally whether or not the works comprising
the edition
are in copyright. The aim of the provision is to protect the
investment of the publisher in the typeset and layout of the publication.
will be the same regardless of whether or not copyright subsists in the
materials used. The Committee also notes that in the
case of media monitoring
services there must be a real question to be determined of whether or not the
reproduction of a single article
would constitute a reproduction of the
published edition or a substantial part of that edition.
15.20 The Committee does not consider that the issue of compulsory or
statutory licences to enable the use of published news materials
monitoring organisations comes within its terms of reference and accordingly
makes no recommendation on this issue.
15.21 However, there is another, separate issue, that the Committee feels is
raised by the reference to it concerning s.88, namely,
whether the
“editions” which are protected by s.88 are confined to printed
editions or whether they do, or should, extend
to editions of works in machine
readable database format. The Committee understands that a recent development in
publishing has been
the publication of works on CD ROM, ie, on compact disc
which, when inserted in a CD ROM reader linked to a computer, can afford
to search the material and read on screen or print out in hard copy all or
selected parts of the material. Given that a published
CD ROM consisting of
public domain works could not depend on copyright in the underlying material for
protection against unauthorised
copying, the question that has been raised in
the Committee is: should original publication in that format be protected
against copying?
15.22 The Committee believes that because of the usefulness of database
facilities to search large works there may well be an increase
in publication in
this format by publishers other than the publishers of the print editions.
Unauthorised copying may in some cases
also include unauthorised copying of the
computer program for operating the database. That issue aside, the Committee
does not see
why the person who prepared the CD ROM publication should not be
able to take action on their own behalf to prevent copying of the
publication in
that format. On the other hand, a non-print format that is another form of
book, which is a sound recording, does
not need such additional protection. Accordingly, the Committee (with one
exception) recommends
that the Act be amended to provide that published edition
(Recommendation 2.65(b)). It notes that the right would be subject to the same
limitations that apply in respect of the published
edition copyright of
traditional literary works. In other words it would be confined to facsimile
copying of the original edition
machine readable format.
15.23 To sum up, the Committee is of the view that the published edition
exclusive right to make
a reproduction of the edition, with “reproduction” being understood
to be an exact copy of the
edition. The Committee (with one exception)
recommends that the means of manufacture of the reproductions that is the
the exclusive right should include scanning onto computer memory and
printing out from the database thus created. Finally, the types
of editions that
can benefit from the protection of copyright under s.88 should not be confined
to printed editions and, specifically,
should extend to editions in computer or
machine readable format.
EXPANSION OF PUBLISHERS’ COPYRIGHT
15.24 During the course of the Committee’s deliberations with respect
to published edition copyright the Committee discussed,
among other matters,
whether published edition copyright was appropriate given changes in technology
directly affecting the publishing
industry and whether the existing
“publishers’ copyright” should be supplemented by any
additional rights. The
Committee has recently become aware that various
publishers’ associations in the European Union have been advocating that
should enjoy a right of exclusive ownership of copyright in the
electronic products they produce. Though the rights comprised in
publishers’ copyright have not been clearly defined by those advocating
their introduction, the Committee assumes that
the rights of publishers would be
similar to those enjoyed by copyright owners of sound recordings, ie. to control
reproduction and
broadcast. Such rights would be clearly “neighbouring
rights”, rewarding the effort and investment of the publisher in
work into a published form.
15.25 Although the Committee considered these matters, it did not seek or
receive any submissions concerning the extension of the
right presently enjoyed
by publishers and it did not reach any conclusions on the future of
publisher’s copyright. However,
the Committee is of the view that further
thought should be given to this issue and in particular any relevant
developments internationally.
The Committee expects that a review of
publishers’ rights could be conducted as part of the Committee’s
future inquiry
into simplification of the Act.
Other Issues
DELIVERY OF MATERIAL TO THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF
16.01 The Committee sought the views of the National Library of Australia
(NLA) on a submission from the Department of State Services
(WA) (WADSS) that
s.201 of the
(the Act), reproduced in Appendix H,
should be amended to require the deposit of computer programs with the NLA and
should also make
special provision for programs which can only be run on
particular computers.
16.02 In its response to the Committee, the NLA indicated that the means of
ensuring the development and preservation of collections
of electronic materials
in libraries has received extensive consideration both in Australia and
overseas. Consideration of these
issues has extended to materials such as
CD–ROM discs, optical discs, electronic databases and electronically
published journals.
16.03 The NLA drew to the Committee’s attention developments in Norway,
where an attempt has been made to ensure that the requirements
legal deposit legislation will facilitate collections of library materials
that truly represent the country’s recorded documentary
heritage by
covering all or most formats in which material is published. Implementation of
the Norwegian scheme is being achieved
through subordinate legislation. Among
the problems identified when considering the form of that legislation have been
(a) for electronic material to be deposited in a standard internal format
(preferred physical formats to ensure accessibility and
long term preservation);
(b) to ensure that there is a regular deposit of material from dynamic
The NLA also advised the Committee that in Norway and Germany (which is
considering legal deposit legislation for electronic publications),
the focus of
the national deposit legislation was not on computer programs but on electronic
publications generally. Accordingly,
there is nothing in their schemes to
suggest that computer programs would necessarily be collected.
16.04 The NLA submitted that for resource reasons it would prefer to have the
power to claim certain categories (or even all categories)
of material on a
selective rather than comprehensive basis. The NLA expressly indicated that
electronic materials, with the possible
inclusion of some types of computer
programs, would be among the formats in respect of which it would like such a
discretionary power.
16.05 The Committee notes that as it presently stands, the definition of
“library material” in s.201(5) of the Act does
not include computer
programs or other materials in machine readable form. The most convenient way to
ensure that the NLA had access
to any machine readable materials (including
computer programs), that it thought appropriate for its purposes, would be to
the scope of that definition.
16.06 In its submission the Australian Copyright Council (ACC) stated that
the initial justification for s.201 was to facilitate the
establishment of a
complete collection of Australian literature. The ACC noted, however, that s.201
is drafted to apply to all library
material published in Australia, and is not
limited to material that is Australian in character. The ACC submitted that it
is difficult
to justify the continued existence of s.201, let alone provide for
its expansion.
16.07 The policy behind the introduction of s.201 is not a matter which needs
to be considered by the Committee given its terms of
reference. For this reason
no recommendation is made with respect to this aspect of the section’s
operation. Nonetheless, the
Committee is concerned to ensure that while a
general provision such as s.201 is considered desirable, it should operate in a
that is up to date.
16.08 Oracle Systems (Australia) Pty Limited (Oracle) was not in favour of a
requirement that computer programs and other materials
in machine readable form
be provided to the NLA. However, it suggested that if the scope of s.201 were to
be broadened the following
restrictions should be imposed:
(a) programs should be deposited in object form only;
(b) mandatory updates should only be provided annually;
(c) programs deposited with the NLA should only be used for fair dealing
(d) programs should only be provided on one port in one language.
16.09 The Committee notes Oracle’s concerns and the comments by the NLA
considered it unlikely that it would be given the considerable
resources which would need to be available if it were to acquire, preserve
continue to make available all materials in all electronic formats. For this
reason the Committee accepts that the NLA should
have a discretionary power in
this area. This would ensure that those classes of material that need to be
available in the long term,
and therefore justify preservation, would be
16.10 The Committee (with one exception) recommends that the definition in
s.201 of the Act be amended to include computer programs
and works stored in
computer memory. It also recommends that in relation to these classes of
materials, the NLA should be given a
discretion to determine the particular
materials for inclusion in its collection. The operation of the scheme should be
by the NLA in consultation with copyright owners (Recommendation
ARCHIVAL COPYING OF MATERIALS INTO MACHINE READABLE
16.11 The Australian Council of Archives (ACA) submitted that the Act does
not make adequate provision for the preservation of material
in machine readable
form. In its submission the ACA noted that both databases and other records in
machine readable form are already
held in archival custody and that a proportion
of such holdings can be expected to require regular copying onto new or
physical media. In some cases this will not be possible without the
use of associated computer programs. Also, unless the associated
or necessary
computer program is available, access to deposited material may be impaired or
impossible. The ACA suggested that, in
circumstances where archives do not have
a copy of the appropriate operating program, depositors should be allowed to
provide a copy
of the operating program to the archives. Where a copy of the
program is provided in such circumstances, the archives should have
the right to
use, and make a back-up copy of, that program without infringing copyright.
16.12 In its submission the Australian Council of Libraries and Information
Services (ACLIS) supported the ACA’s suggestion.
ACLIS also submitted that
any copying should only be allowed for the limited purposes of preserving and
accessing archival material
deposited in machine readable form.
16.13 The Committee has given
consideration to the ACA’s and
submission. It also notes that the protection of
computer programs as literary works under the Berne Convention for the
of Literary and Artistic Works (Berne Convention) is required by
Article 10(1) of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
Rights (TRIPS) (See explanation of TRIPS in Chapter 3). Accordingly, Article
9(2) of the Berne Convention will apply. Article
9(2) allows member countries to
provide for the reproduction of works in special cases, where that reproduction
does not conflict
with the normal exploitation of the work and does not
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.
16.14 In the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
Guide to the
Berne Convention
for the protection of Literary and Artistic Works
(Geneva, 1978) (the WIPO Guide) the issue of photocopying and its impact on
authors is discussed (p. 57, paragraph 9.12). The WIPO
Guide notes that on the
one hand, large scale photocopying can seriously damage the interests of
hand, it greatly facilitates the diffusion of
knowledge. It goes on to state that the interests of copyright owners must be
with the needs of users, and that it rests with each country to take
appropriate measures best adapted to its educational, cultural,
social, and
economic development. The Committee notes that the Berne Convention should not
be treated as a statute, and that it is
entitled to be given a broader
interpretation to ensure full effect is given to its intention. In this regard
the Committee notes
that this approach appears to have been adopted by the
Australian Government when it first introduced a statutory licence in respect
photocopying for educational purposes.
16.15 In its Draft Report the Committee sought further submissions on this
issue (paragraph 16.10). In preparing the final report
the Committee has noted
the views of ACLIS and the fact that there were no submissions which opposed the
recommendation formulated
in the Draft Report. Accordingly, the Committee
reaffirms the position it adopted in the Draft Report—that to ensure the
presentation and availability of archival material, archives should be
allowed to make copies of computer programs for the limited
purposes of
preserving and accessing archival material deposited in machine readable form
(Recommendation 2.67).
PROOF OF OWNERSHIP OF COPYRIGHT IN COMPUTER
16.16 Lotus Development Pty Ltd (Lotus) and the Business Software Association
of Australia Limited (BSAA) submitted that proving ownership
of copyright in a
computer program, particularly where it was written by a number of people over a
period of time, can be a difficult
task. Lotus noted that proof of ownership
required the copyright owner to show that each programmer was an employee of the
owner at the time he or she wrote the program or that an assignment of
the copyright was executed in favour of the owner. Lotus added
that where a
program was written overseas the problem is compounded.
16.17 Lotus and the BSAA also noted that both US and UK copyright legislation
assists copyright owners. In the US there is a registration
system—even
though it is no longer compulsory to register for copyright protection as a
consequence of the US becoming a party
to the Berne Convention. In the UK s.104
and s.105 of the UK
contain provisions to the effect that where works or sound recordings and
films are issued to the public bearing a statement that
a named person is the
owner of copyright in the work that fact is presumed to be correct unless the
contrary is proved by the defendant.
16.18 Microsoft Pty Ltd (Microsoft) suggested that the issues of subsistence
and proof of ownership of copyright in computer programs
should be addressed by
the insertion of a new s.130A into the Act drafted in similar terms to the
current s.130, which allows subsistence
and ownership of copyright in sound
recordings to be presumed by reference to labels or marks on such recordings.
The Committee notes
that s.130 provides a rebuttable presumption in relation to
sound recordings similar to that provided under s.105 of the UK
(see Appendix M). The Committee also notes the submission by Lotus
seeking to justify such a provision is on the basis that ownership
disputed by a defendant as a means of discouraging a plaintiff to pursue
proceedings (because of the difficulty and cost).
Microsoft claimed that any
costs that a defendant incurs by doing so are not a sufficient deterrent because
a plaintiff only recovers
a portion of his costs.
16.19 Microsoft submitted that, in addition to, or as an alternative to its
proposal, a registration system recording details of the
ownership of copyright
should be established. It suggested that a register could be established under
the auspices of what is now
the Department of Industry, Science and Technology.
The register would constitute:
(a) a rebuttable presumption of the existence and ownership of copyright in a
computer program; and
(b) imputed knowledge of any importer or pirate of the existence and
ownership of copyright for the purpose of sections 37 and 38
of the Act.
Microsoft acknowledged that the register could not be the basis upon which
because of the
prohibition in Article 5(2) of the Berne Convention on making any formal
registration procedure a precondition to
recognition of copyright .
16.20 The Committee is not persuaded that a registration system such as that
proposed by Microsoft is warranted. It is not clear what
public benefit would
accrue from the expenditure of public moneys to establish a system that would
only serve to facilitate the copyright
owner’s capacity to assert his or
her rights. The Committee is also not convinced that a voluntary registration
system would
be of much practical value, given the likely limits on its
reliability. It would not be comprehensive and, where ownership of copyright
a particular program or other work changed hands, either the new or old owner
might fail to register the change.
16.21 As an alternative to its proposal concerning the proof of ownership of
to require a defendant
to give security for costs or pay the plaintiff’s costs on an indemnity
basis, where he or she seeks
to challenge ownership of copyright without having
any reasonable grounds for believing that the plaintiff is not the owner of the
Patents Act 1952,
the Court should have power to make a
solicitor–client costs order in favour of the plaintiff where the
defendant has put the
plaintiff to proof of ownership and/or subsistence of
determination and a declaration of ownership and/or subsistence has been made.
The Committee notes that the
Patents Act 1952
has been repealed and
replaced by the
Patents Act 1990
of that Act now provides for
the issue of a certificate of validity on the same basis as previously provided
16.22 The Committee favours an amendment to the Act to facilitate the proof
of the subsistence and ownership of copyright in computer
programs. In this
regard the Committee notes that the
(which lapsed following the dissolution of the House of Representatives prior to
the March 1993 Federal election) provided
for the reform of the presumptions
contained in s.126 of the Act, in so far as they apply to the subsistence and
ownership of copyright
in sound recordings. The explanatory memorandum to the
Bill states (p. 20, paragraph 76):
. . . the introduction of a new section 126A is designed to facilitate the
enforcement of a copyright owner’s rights in civil
sound recording piracy
proceedings where a claim of subsistence and ownership of copyright by the
plaintiff is established with appropriate
16.23 The Explanatory Memorandum continues its explanation of the proposed
reforms further as follows (p. 21, paragraphs 77–80):
Clause 11 inserts the new s.126A into the Act which will provide, in an
action brought under Part V of the Act in relation to a sound
recording, that if
the plaintiff files an affidavit stating that the date and place of first
publication are specified on the sound
recording label or container and
specifying that date and that place of first publication, copyright is presumed
to subsist in the
sound recording (s.126A(1)).
New s.126A(2) will provide that, if the subsistence of copyright is presumed
under subsection (1), the plaintiff is presumed to be
entitled to bring the
action under Part V in relation to the sound recording if the affidavit filed by
the plaintiff asserts that
the plaintiff is the maker of the sound recording and
is specified as such on the sound recording label or container and that he
she has not assigned the copyright in the recording.
New s.126A(3) provides that, if the plaintiff is not the maker of the sound
recording, the plaintiff is presumed to be entitled to
bring the action under
Part V in relation to the sound recording if the affidavit filed by the
plaintiff asserts that the plaintiff
is entitled to bring the action as the
assignee or exclusive licensee of the copyright in the sound recording:
(i)from the maker; or
(ii)from a person other than the maker,
and lists all the persons through whom the plaintiff claims to have the
assignment or licence of the copyright in the sound recording.
New s.126A(4) provides that the presumptions under subsections (1), (2) and
(3) apply unless the contrary is established . . .
In effect s.126 of the Act was to be read subject to the proposed s.126A. The
Committee notes that the Bill has not as yet been reintroduced.
16.24 In its Draft Report, the Committee recommended that a provision like
the proposed s.126A of the Bill be introduced in respect
of computer programs.
The view of the Committee in respect of this matter has been widely supported
and remains unchanged (Recommendation
2.68). The ACC suggested a further
extension to the Committee’s recommendation—that it should apply not
only to computer
programs, but to all material in computer readable form. The
Committee notes the ACC’s suggestion. However, having regard to
absence of detailed submissions on this issue it considers it would not be
appropriate to make a further recommendation as suggested
by the ACC. The
Committee recommends that this issue should be further considered as part of any
reference to consider simplification
(Recommendation
PRIVILEGE AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION
Lotus’s submission
16.25 In its 1990 submission to the Committee Lotus raised as a concern for
self-incrimination,
submitting that its operation may “severely hamper” the prosecution
of an infringement action. At
common law, a person is not obliged to answer
questions or to produce documents where the giving of answers or the production
documents would tend to expose him or her to a criminal charge. Lotus
envisaged a situation where the privilege may be used to withhold
containing evidence about the number of infringing copies of a computer program
made and sold or the state of knowledge
of an infringer. Lotus referred to the
decision of Waddell CJ in
BPA Industries Limited
where his Honour expressed the view that the privilege could be used
to defeat an Anton Piller order and that a similar provision
to that of s.72 of
Supreme Court Act 1981
(UK) should be adopted in NSW. Lotus also
submitted that such a provision should be adopted. It should be noted that the
has held that the privilege does not to apply to corporations
Environment Protection Authority
Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd
[1993] HCA 74
(1993) 118 ALR 392)
and the Full Court of the Federal Court has held
similarly, in a majority decision, that the privilege against self-exposure to a
penalty does not apply to corporations (
Trade Practices Commission
Abbco Ice Works Pty Ltd and Others
[1994] FCA 1279
(1994) 123 ALR 503.
Court’s decision is now reflected in the Commonwealth
Evidence Bill 1993
(discussed further below from paragraph 16.28).
Position in the UK
16.26 The privilege against self-incrimination was considered in the UK in
the early 1980s and led to the inclusion of s.72 in the
Supreme Court Act
(see Appendix K). The effect of the provision is to remove the
privilege against self-incrimination in proceedings relating to the
infringement
of intellectual property rights. However, s.72 also provides that no statement
or admission made by a person in answering
a question or otherwise complying
with an order in such proceedings is to be admissible evidence against that
person in criminal
proceedings. Lotus submitted that such a provision should be
adopted in New South Wales.
Review of Commonwealth and States evidence
16.27 Reform of the law of evidence was considered by the Standing Committee
of Attorneys-General (SCAG) and on 25 October 1991 SCAG
agreed to support, in
principle, the adoption of substantially uniform evidence laws based on
Commonwealth and New South Wales Evidence
Bills introduced in that year
(Evidence Bill 1991 (Cth), Evidence Bill (NSW) introduced into Legislative
Assembly on 23 March 1993).
A common text for New South Wales and Commonwealth
Evidence Bills was then
prepared. The Commonwealth’s Evidence Bill
1993 (the Bill) was passed by the House of Representatives on 19 October 1994.
Committee understands that the Bill is likely to be debated in the Winter
1995 sittings of Parliament.
16.28 The Bill includes a provision similar to clause 120 of the Commonwealth
Evidence Bill 1991
, concerning the privilege in respect of self-incrimination.
The Explanatory Memorandum to the
Evidence Bill 1993
explains the operation of
clause 128 (pp. 36–37):
This clause provides a general rule that a court must not require a witness
to give particular evidence if the witness objects that
the evidence may tend to
prove he or she has committed an offence or is liable to a civil penalty, and
the court is satisfied there
are reasonable grounds for the objection.
The court may require the witness to give the evidence . . . if the interest
of justice require the witness to give the evidence.
The certificate has the effect that evidence given by the witness to which it
relates, and evidence of any information or document
or thing obtained as a
direct or indirect consequence of the person having given evidence, is not
admissible in any Australian proceeding,
except a criminal proceeding in respect
of the falsity of the evidence.
16.29 As mentioned in paragraph 16.25 the privilege against self
incrimination has been abolished as it applies to corporations and
representatives. Clause 187 of the
Evidence Bill 1993
has the effect that if a
body corporate is required to answer questions or give information, produce
documents or other thing or
do any other act it is not entitled to refuse or
fail to comply with the requirement on the grounds that complying with the
might tend to incriminate the body or make the body liable to a penalty.
The Committee understands that where an individual is representing
a corporation
clause 187 will apply. Additionally an individual representing a corporation
would be bound by clause 187 even where
in the process of complying with a
request to a body corporate that individual may be incriminated.
16.30 The Committee agrees with Lotus’s submission that the privilege
against self-incrimination should be removed in respect
of civil proceedings
relating to the infringement of copyright, provided that an indemnity is also
given in relation to other proceedings.
Submissions to the Committee following
the Draft Report indicated that there is broad based support for this
proposal.The Committee
understands that the provisions of the
Evidence Bill
apply to civil proceedings relating to copyright infringement and will have the
effect that the privilege will not be available
to a witness where that witness
has no reasonable grounds for not giving particular evidence or where the
interests of justice require
that the witness give evidence. The Committee
expects that in most cases these qualifications on the privilege and the fact
the privilege does not apply to corporations will assist litigants in
makes no further
recommendation in relation to the privilege against self-incrimination
(Recommendation 2.70).
POSSESSION IN THE COURSE OF A BUSINESS
16.31 Lotus submitted that an additional infringing act of “possession
in the course of a business” should be added to
s.38 of the Act. Currently
s.38 prohibits certain commercial dealings in infringing copies or in copies
which have been imported
without the consent of the copyright owner. Lotus
suggested that s.38 should be extended to include possession by a person in the
course of business of an article which he or she knows or has reason to believe
is an infringing copy of a work. In this regard Lotus
pointed out that s.23 of
the UK CDP Act (see Appendix L) provides, in part:
The copyright in a work is infringed by a person who, without the licence of
the copyright owner—
(a) possesses in the course of a business . . .
an article which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe is an
infringing copy of the work.
16.32 Lotus submitted that a provision of this sort would assist copyright
owners in situations where infringing copies of a computer
program were found at
the premises of a commercial organisation, but it could not be proved that the
organisation had made the copies
or was using them. The Committee notes that
s.132(2A) of the Act in effect makes it an offence for a person to have in his
possession an article for various commercial purposes:
. . . or for any other purpose to an extent that will affect prejudicially
the owner of the copyright in the work . . .
if the person knows or ought reasonably to know the article is an infringing
copy. This provision applies to both works and subject
matter other than works
(s.132(4)). Section 132(2A) was introduced into the Act by the
Amendment Act 1986
. In his second reading speech the then Attorney-General,
Lionel Bowen MP, commented (House of Representatives 1986,
vol. HR149, p. 3668):
The Government has been concerned that the
offences do not
afford owners protection at each point at which they are vulnerable to
commercial piracy. The new offence of possession
of an infringing copy for
commercial purposes, and the new and restructured offences of causing infringing
public performance of
(emphasis added)
16.33 The Committee received numerous responses to its draft proposal in
respect of this matter. Oracle was in support of the adoption
of legislation
similar to that of the UK CDP Act
relating to the infringing activity of
“possession in the course of business”. Oracle’s submission
suggested that
corporate overuse of software by individuals fell into two broad
categories:
(a) overuse by those who were indifferent about copyright protection; and
(b) overuse by those who mistakenly make copies.
16.34 Oracle submitted that the instances of copyright abuse would be
significantly reduced by the enactment of appropriate legislation
making it an
offence to illegally possess copyright material in the course of business. The
ACC also supported the enactment of a
provision similar to the UK Act, whereby
the possession of infringing copies in the course of business would infringe
16.35 In its submission the Law Council of Australia (LCA) recommended the
implementation of provisions like those in the UK but emphasised
the need for
the law to be drafted so that it would not lead to harsh results. The example
given was that in certain situations,
over zealous employees illegally copy
programs to help them with their work outside of hours. The LCA submission
warned of the dangers
in enforcing vicarious liability on employers in such
circumstances. The LCA’s submission suggested that the only basis for
liability for employers in any such legislation should be if the employer had
actual, rather than imputed, notice that illegal copying
had occurred.
16.36 The Committee notes that s.132(2A) is narrower in scope than s.23 of
the UK CDP Act in that an element of the offence is having
a purpose, viz, trade
or other prejudicial distribution, whereas the UK provision refers merely to
possession in the course of business
without requiring proof of any purpose. In
the Committee’s view it would be consistent with the policy behind the
introduction
of s.132(2A) if copyright owners were to be granted a counterpart
right to bring civil actions under Parts III and IV of the Act
for possession,
for commercial purposes, of infringing copies known to be such.
16.37 The Committee believes that the best way to ensure that copyright
breaches are kept to a minimum is by imposing higher standards
of care on all
Committee, therefore, recommends that the
Act be amended so that an employer
will be guilty of an offence where he or she is found in possession of an
article which he or
she knew, or ought to have reasonably known, is an
infringing copy of a work (Recommendation 2.71(a)). Also consistently with the
Committee’s recommendation that software penalties be brought into line
with those applying in respect of unauthorised commercial
cinematographic films, it recommends that (Recommendation 2.71(b)):
(a) a first offence be punishable with a fine not exceeding $1,500 for the
article, or for each article, to which the offence relates
or imprisonment for a
period not exceeding 2 years, or both; or if the person is a body
corporate—a fine not exceeding $7,500
for the article, or for each
article, to which the offence relates; and
(b) for any subsequent offence a penalty not exceeding $50,000 for an
individual, or 5 years imprisonment, or both; or if the person
corporate—a fine not exceeding $250,000 .
ANTON PILLER ORDERS
16.38 Microsoft submitted that the common law relating to Anton Piller orders
should be codified such that subject to:
(a) an arguable case of infringement by a pirate or grey marketeer being
produced to the Court by the plaintiff;
(b) an arguable case of ownership being produced, ie, by reliance on the
proposed s.130A (see paragraph 16.18) or a declaration of
the court (see
paragraph 16.21);
(c) the usual undertakings being given by the plaintiff to the Court as to
(d) payment into court of a bond by the plaintiff in respect of such damages;
(e) the imposition of special penalties for misleading or withholding
relevant evidence from the Court by the plaintiff
then the plaintiff should be entitled to an Anton Piller order.
16.39 The Committee is of the view that the proposal by Microsoft merits
serious consideration, concerning as it does a procedural
issue that is very
important to the enforcement of copyright. However, for the very reason that it
affects copyright generally the
Committee feels that it falls outside the
Committee’s terms of reference, which are limited to computer programs,
and published editions. Accordingly, the Committee feels unable to
make a specific recommendation in respect of it, other than to
suggest serious
consideration of this proposal for the codification of the law on Anton Piller
orders (see paragraph 2.72).
PROGRAM LOCKS
16.40 The Committee received a number of submissions concerning the use of
locking devices on computer programs (already discussed
in paragraphs
10.90–10.94). Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd and Gilbert and Tobin Solicitors
noted that Article 6 of the draft EC
Directive on the legal protection of
computer programs (as it stood in 1990) provided that it would be an
infringement to:
. . . make, import, possess or deal with articles intended specifically to
facilitate the removal or circumvention of any technical
means which may have
been applied to protect a program.
Article 7(1)(c) of the Directive, as adopted, provides that Member States
shall provide appropriate remedies against a person committing:
any act of putting into circulation, or the possession for commercial
purposes of, any means the sole intended purpose of which is
to facilitate the
unauthorised removal or circumvention of any technical device which may have
been applied to protect a computer
Sun Microsystems Australia Pty Ltd also submitted that the elimination,
deletion or by-passing of copyright protection devices should
be an offence
punishable by a fine. The WADSS submitted that copy protection should be limited
to computer programs licensed for
use in a commercial environment.
Interestingly, in its submission the Queensland Department of Education urged
that the production
of locked computer programs should be prohibited by
legislation.
16.41 At the Public Hearings held in July 1990, IBM Australia Ltd drew to the
Committee’s attention s.296 of the UK CDP Act.
Section 296 deals with
devices designed to circumvent copy protection. The section applies to works
issued in electronic form that
are copy protected. It provides that the person
issuing copies to the public has the same rights against a person who:
(a) makes, imports, sells or lets for hire, offers or exposes for sale or
hire, or advertises for sale or hire, any device or means
specifically designed
or adapted to circumvent the form of copy-protection employed, or
(b) publishes information intended to enable or assist persons to circumvent
that form of copy-protection,
as a copyright owner has in respect of an infringement of copyright.
A person will be caught by the section if that person knows, or has reason to
believe, that the device will be used to make infringing
copies. The section
also extends to such devices the rights under that Act to delivery up or seizure
of certain articles.
16.42 The Committee is of the view that the unauthorised circumvention of
locking devices should be actionable at the suit of copyright
owners and their
exclusive licensees. In other words the use of any device which enables the
unauthorised use of a program should
be prohibited. Accordingly, the Committee
recommends that the Act be ammended to provide that copyright owners and their
licensees should have the right to prevent the commercial manufacture,
importation, distribution and possession for commercial purposes
which are designed to facilitate the unauthorised circumvention of locks or
other devices applied to protect computer
programs from unauthorised copying
(Recommendation 2.73).
16.43 The Committee would like to emphasise that there will be instances
where the users of copyright material will have cause to
legitimately circumvent
locking devices, such as for the purpose of decompilation for error correction
or to create a new interoperable
program. The Committee is of the view that the
onus should lie with users of computer programs to clearly understand the
circumstances
in which the circumvention of a program locking device will be
permissible.
PENALTIES FOR CRIMINAL OFFENCES UNDER THE ACT
16.44The BSAA submitted that
29 January 1993, p.4):
. . . the penalties for software piracy should be substantially greater and
not less than those for films and videos.
16.45 In its Draft Report the Committee noted that the
had the effect that the penalties for piracy of sound recording
offences under the Act would be brought into line with those for
cinematograph
films. The Committee also recommended in the Draft Report that, having regard to
the size and importance of the computer
program industry and the potential
damage that unauthorised commercial copying of programs would cause to copyright
owners (as well
as the ease with which it can be accomplished,) and in order to
discourage computer software piracy, the criminal penalties in relation
computer programs should be brought into line with those currently applying to
films and proposed for sound recordings (Draft
Recommendation 2.54).
16.46 In a supplementary submission to the Committee in response to the Draft
Report, the BSAA supported the recommendation made by
the Committee in the Draft
Report. The BSAA also emphasised that increased penalties for software copyright
infringement could only
be effective if:
(a) the Australian Federal Police are given the resources and show a
commitment to bringing criminal prosecutions for software copyright
infringement; and
(b) the courts actually impose substantial penalties for offences of
software copyright infringement.
16.47 As part of its submission the BSAA referred to the current criminal
sanctions for software copyright breaches in the United
Kingdom, Taiwan and the
United States. The Committee notes that the penalties in each of these countries
are higher than those currently
provided for in the Act. For instance, the UK
CDP Act provides in s.107(4), in relation to criminal liability for the making
with infringing articles, that where a person is found liable on
summary conviction, the penalty can be up to six months imprisonment
up to £5,000 (s.107(4)(a)). Alternatively, where a person is convicted on
indictment, they may face a fine or imprisonment
for up to two years or both
(s.107(4)(b)). The Committee understands that the amount of a fine that can be
imposed is not specifically
limited by any statute.
16.48 In addition, unlike the current provisions in the Australian Act, the
UK CDP Act does not distinguish between first and subsequent
offences and it is
therefore possible in the UK, for a person found liable of an offence for the
first time to be imprisoned. It
should be noted that the penalties stated in the
UK CDP Act are maximum penalties and that courts in the UK, as in Australia,
discretion in imposing penalties. Consequently, not all offences would
attract prison sentences or the highest fine. The Committee
understands that the
Government’s current policy in relation to Commonwealth offences is to set
down maximum penalties for
offences, not to distinguish between first and
subsequent offences and, as mentioned above, to allow discretion to courts to
up to the maximum penalty as they see fit in the circumstances. Future
amendments to the Act may therefore result in a change to
the present
distinction between first and subsequent offences.
16.49 If the Committee’s recommendation in relation to computer
programs is implemented, the maximum penalties that could be
imposed for a first
offence for commercial dealing or possession of infringing copies would be
$1,500 or two years imprisonment or
both. For a subsequent offence a five year
prison term could be imposed. The Committee believes that an amendment to this
would be an effective deterrent to address the issue of unauthorised
dealings in computer programs and therefore endorses its previous
recommendation
(Recommendation 2.74).
DISTRIBUTION OF COPYRIGHT MATERIALS VIA COMPUTER
BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEMS
16.50 At a meeting in March 1994 the Committee considered the issue of the
unauthorised copying and distribution of copyright materials
via computer
bulletin board systems (BBS). However, it should be noted that the Committee
received no submissions regarding copyright
infringement through use of BBS and
was not in a position to seek submissions on this issue during 1994.
Accordingly, the Committee
has not made any recommendations on the most
appropriate way in which to respond to the copyright issues raised by BBS (and
the international
network, Internet).
16.51 The technology of computer bulletin boards systems (BBS) can be
described as follows (Bulletin Board Task Force,
Regulation of Computer
Bulletin Board Systems
(August 1994),Appendix C, p.54):
Generally speaking, a ‘computer bulletin board’ is a computer
program that simulates the functions of the physical bulletin
boards found in
supermarkets, universities and other public gathering places.
To create a BBS, an individual needs a computer, the necessary software
(i.e., the computer program), and the means to communicate
with other computers,
usually through a modem (a device that enables the user to send and receive
digital data over a telephone line).
BBS can be configured to be accessible to
select groups or the public at large, freely or on a charged basis. Little
specialist knowledge,
equipment or capital outlay is needed to establish a
simple BBS. The computer hardware required and the software necessary to create
a BBS are affordable, with the latter often being freely available.
BBS are typically accessed via modems and the public telephone network. Users
simply dial the number of the board through their computer
in order to gain
access to a central or ‘host’ computer system. They generally
register their name and other details
to gain BBS access rights. They are then
given a password and often charged annual access fees.
16.52 The Committee understands that BBS not only allow callers to send
messages to the BBS, read and delete existing messages but
also copy information
already on the BBS into their own computer. It is the ability to copy
information, such as computer programs
and other copyright materials, by
downloading them from the BBS that is a concern for copyright owners. The
anonymity with which
users can access BBS and post messages makes detection of
such practices extremely difficult. Equally importantly, BBS operators
participate in the exchange of information between users, nor do they usually
know who the users actually are as most use
code names. The fact that the
posting of messages can involve no positive act by the operator together with
the large volume of messages
that may be on a board at any one time, means that
no single operator could be aware of everything being posted on to and taken off
the board at any particular time. Determining who should be held responsible for
a BBS is an issue that requires
further consideration and without the benefit of submissions on this issue the
Committee has not
made any recommendations on who should be held responsible.
This issue is discussed further in paragraphs 16.62 to 16.65.
Bulletin Board Task Force
16.53 In February 1994 the Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, and the
Minister for Communications and the Arts, Michael Lee, jointly
established a
Task Force to consider options for the regulation of bulletin boards. The focus
of the Task Force’s inquiry was
censorship and content issues. However, it
was also required to examine the adequacy of existing laws to deal with the
technology. In its August 1994 report the Task Force has made
recommendations with respect to the regulation of the content of material
available on BBS, especially “adult” material, whether it be
pornographic, violent or sexually explicit material. While
the placing and use
of such material may involve copyright issues, these are not addressed in the
Task Force’s report. The
Task Force recommended, as its preferred option,
that the BBS community be self-regulating ie. that BBS operators and users
and adopt guidelines for their industry. However, the question which
arises is whether such self-regulation is appropriate with respect
to the use of
US legal developments
16.54 Actions for copyright infringement relating to the distribution of
of cases in the
US. These cases highlight how the use of BBS may result in infringement of
the issue of who should be held
responsible for such infringements. In
Playboy Enterprises Inc. v
George Frena d/b/a Techs Warehouse BBS Systems and Consulting, and Mark
839 F. Supp. 1552 (M.
D. Fla. 1993) (
Playboy case
) the Florida
District Court considered a copyright infringement suit brought by the magazine,
Playboy, against the operator of a
subscription computer bulletin board for
unauthorised distribution of its copyrighted photographs. Schlesinger J held
that two copyrights
of the plaintiff had been infringed, namely the right to
distribute copies of a work to the public and the right to display pictorial
works publicly.
16.55 In another unreported case 140 music publishers sued CompuServe
(database operators) for copyright infringement of 500 musical
works which had
been uploaded onto one of CompuServe’s bulletin boards, MIDI/Music Forum.
The Committee is aware that in the
Intellectual Property Law Bulletin
(Vol 7, No. 6, July 1994, p.80) it was reported that subscribers to this
particular CompuServe bulletin board could download to their
own personal
computers, musical material placed there by other subscribers. The music
publishers charged CompuServe with wilful acts
of copyright infringement by

filed 29 Nov 1993)
16.56 In a more recent decision
Sega Enterprises
(No. C93–4262 CW, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5266 (N. D. Cal.
Mar. 28. 1994) (
) the court granted a preliminary injunction
finding that facilitating unauthorised copying by providing facilities,
direction, knowledge
and encouragement amounted to contributory infringement on
the part of the BBS operator. With the knowledge of the defendant, users
bulletin board, Maphia, were uploading and downloading unauthorised copies of
Sega’s video games through use of devices
provided by the defendant.
16.57 Finally, the Committee is aware of further copyright infringement
actions being taken against bulletin board operators. In the
(Vol 2, No. 9, p.11) it is reported that David LaMacchia is charged
with criminal fraud for making $1 million worth of computer software
on the Internet. Similarly the
Wall Street Journal
reported on 27
September 1994 that an operator of an internationally used bulletin board was
charged with criminal violation of copyright
for the unauthorised copying of
computer software. The newspaper article reported that Lotus Development
Corporation’s Lotus
1–2–3 and Symantec Corp.’s Norton
Utilities were available to subscribers to the service for US$99 per year.
US Green Paper on Intellectual Property and the
National Information Infrastructure
16.58 In July 1994 the US Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights,
released a preliminary draft Green Paper that considers the
intellectual
property implications of the National Information Infrastructure. The Green
Paper discusses the range of rights presently
enjoyed by copyright owners of
works and how these may be adapted to address technological advancements such as
distribution of works
electronically, for instance by BBS. To address possible
deficiencies in the US
, not only arising from BBS, the
Working Group recommended that the distribution right be amended to include
transmission of copies
Legal position in Australia
16.59 The relevant provision of the Act is s.132 which is concerned with
offences arising from the making of and dealing in articles
that are infringing
copies of copyright works. The making of articles for sale or hire, their sale,
hire or exposition for trade
and the importation, distribution and possession of
them are all activities which are prohibited by this section. By virtue of
s.132 applies to both copyright “works” and “subject
matter other than works”.
16.60 The Committee notes that s.132 of the Act may not apply where
electronic reproductions of works are made, even where they may
be infringing
copies and/or where this was facilitated by the use of a BBS. This view is based
on two related issues of interpretation
of the section. These are as
(i) As the Act refers to dealing in “
infringing copies of works, for electronic copies or reproductions of works to
be covered by s.132 they would have
to fall within the meaning of
“article”. It is arguable that “article” means a
physical or tangible article
and does not extend to electronic infringing copies
of copyright materials.
(ii) Although, s.132(5A) of the Act, introduced by the
provides as follows:
For the purposes of this section, a
transmission
by a person of
a computer program that is received and recorded so as to result in the creation
of an infringing copy of the computer
program shall be deemed to be a
distribution
by the person of that infringing copy (emphasis added).
and would appear to apply to cases where works are distributed by electronic
methods, the Committee notes that the use of bulletin
boards may not involve any
transmission
distribution
by either the BBS operator or
any users with the result that the use of this technology to provide access to
not be caught by the offence provisions in s.132. For
• The person who places a copyright work or film onto a BBS would not
appear to be distributing it, since this act would not
appear to involve
delivery to known persons or known subscribers and could not therefore be
construed as an act of distribution.
For example, it is possible that a BBS
message may not be accessed and therefore the chain of distribution from
distributor to distributee
would be broken.
• Those having access to a BBS can if they choose retrieve a work or
film from the BBS and copy it onto their hard disc. This
act can occur without
the involvement of the operator of the BBS and so there will not be a
“transmission by a person”
as required by the section.
• In addition, the person who receives and records any copyright
material accessed from the BBS would not be guilty of an offence
of distribution
(or transmission), unless the meaning of distribution was made wide enough to
encompass an act of acquiring a copy
for oneself. It should be noted that the
section does not create an offence of receiving and recording the transmission
for the act of transmission.
In reaching this conclusion in respect to s. 132(5A), the Committee notes
that the Explanatory Memorandum (EM) regarding the s.132(5A)
amendment says
This provision will thus extend the existing prohibition on commercial
distribution of ‘pirate’ copies of programs to
cover the situation
where the program is supplied to the purchaser not as a physical copy but by way
of a transmission which he can
It appears to the Committee that although the intention expressed in the EM
was to expand the concept of distribution in s.132(2)
to include distribution by
electronic means, the amendment does not address the issue discussed in (i) and
also, does not go far
enough to cover the special case of
“transmission” by BBS.
16.61 The Committee also notes that the Copyright Convergence Group has
recommended the introduction of a new transmission right for
and that the Government has announced its intention to adopt the CCG’s
recommendations. The Committee recommends
that when such a right is introduced
consideration should be given to the amendment of s.132 and more specifically
s.132(5A) which
also concerns offences arising from the transmission of computer
programs (Recommendation 2..75).
16.62 Although there is doubt as to whether the offence provisions in the Act
apply to BBS, copyright will be infringed by the unauthorised
distribution of
materials will result in their reproduction.
The difficulty for copyright owners
is that the individuals concerned may be hard to trace. This raises the question
of whether the
bulletin board operator should be deemed to be responsible for
such infringements, (this appears to be the approach that US courts
are taking).
The Committee notes that the position of copyright owners is made even more
difficult by the fact that some BBS are
international in their operation. Thus
it is quite possible that copyright materials may be loaded into the BBS by a
user in a different
country to the operator of the BBS and that another user in
a third country might download that material. Any or all of the parties
a case may be in a different country to the copyright owner.
16.63 In relation to the liability of BBS operators in Australia, mention
should be made of s.13(2) of the Act which provides:
For the purposes of this Act, the exclusive right to do an act in relation to
a work, an adaptation of a work or any other subject-matter
includes the
exclusive right to authorize a person to do that act in relation to that work,
adaptation or other subject-matter.
The effect of this section, as far as copyright infringement is concerned, is
that a person may be liable for indirect, as distinct
from direct, infringement,
by in some way authorising another person to commit an infringement. Australian
courts, as well as UK
courts, have held that authorise should be understood in
its ordinary dictionary sense of “sanction, approve and
countenance”.
The leading Australian decision in this area,
of New South Wales
(1975) 133 CLR 1
endorsed this view
and also discussed what types of actions or inactions may constitute
authorisation. In his text,
The Law of Intellectual Property
Company, Sydney, 1984, pp. 228–234), Professor Ricketson provides a guide
to what may be elucidated from the cases
in this area and gives some general
propositions on authorisation. First, he suggests that before a person can be
held to have authorised
an infringement of copyright he/she must have had some
power to prevent it or had some control over the person committing the
act. Next, there must be a specific act/s of infringement linked to
the actions of the alleged authoriser; it is not sufficient to
infringement was encouraged, there must actually be infringement. Finally, there
is no requirement that the alleged authoriser
have knowledge that a specific
infringement has occurred. Professor Ricketson concludes his discussion by
noting that liability for
steps are taken to avoid infringing acts occurring, depending on the
circumstances
of the case.
16.64 In paragraph 14.20 the Committee acknowledged that the position of
operators of databases and bulletin board operators in respect
reproduction of copyright materials by the users of their services was somewhat
different. Although not offering any concluded
view on whether bulletin board
operators would generally be found to have authorised copyright infringements,
it appears to the Committee
that the issue of whether bulletin board operators
have effective control over the BBS they provide would be crucial to any
on this matter. As argued by defendants in the US, bulletin board
operators claim not to have knowledge of or control over the activities
subscribers. Though this argument has not been successful to date in the US, it
cannot be assumed that it would be equally
unsuccessful in Australia.
16.65 If bulletin board operators are not regarded as having authorised
is should they
nonetheless be deemed to be liable? Additionally, should such bulletin board
operators be able to avoid liability
by, for instance, posting warning notices
and their content may have a bearing on any avoidance of liability if,
for instance, they were not to be taken seriously and were
merely token
gestures. As these issues were not raised in submissions to the Committee, nor
mentioned in the Draft Report, the Committee
does not feel it has been able to
give these issues the consideration which they require. Accordingly, it makes no
specific recommendation
on any of the issues if has raised. The Committee does,
however, recommend that the issues raised by BBS be considered in the context
the proposed review of the Act (Recommendation 2.76).
solutions to the copyright problems raised by BBS will, in the Committee’s
view, have to acknowledge that the particular
form of distribution of copyright
materials using BBS, sometimes involving both piracy and own-use copying,
appears to be extremely
difficult to detect and potentially uncontrollable and
for this reason may have quite severe implications for all copyright owners,
just owners of computer programs.

Article 2(1) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and
Artistic Works
(1) The expression “literary and artistic works” shall include
every production in the literary, scientific and artistic
domain, whatever may
be the mode or form of its expression, such as books, pamphlets and other
writings; lectures, addresses, sermons
and other works of the same nature;
dramatic or dramatico-musical works; choreographic works and entertainments in
dumb show; musical
compositions with or without words; cinematographic works to
which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
works of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving and lithography;
photographic works to which are assimilated works
expressed by a process
analogous to photography, works of applied art; illustrations, maps, plans,

The Council of the European Communities Directive on the Legal
Protection of Computer Programs — 14 May 1991 (91/250/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and
in particular Article 100a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
In cooperation with the European Parliament,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee,
Whereas computer programs are at present not clearly protected in all Member
States by existing legislation and such protection, where
it exists, has
different attributes;
Whereas the development of computer programs requires the investment of
considerable human, technical and financial resources while
computer programs
can be copied at a fraction of the cost needed to develop them
independently;
Whereas computer programs are playing an increasingly important role in a
broad range of industries and computer program technology
can accordingly be
considered as being of fundamental importance for the Community’s
industrial development;
Whereas certain differences in the legal protection of computer programs
offered by the laws of the Member States have direct and
negative effects on the
functioning of the common market as regards computer programs and such
differences could well become greater
as Member States introduce new legislation
on this subject;
Whereas existing difference having such effects need to be removed and new
ones prevented from arising, while difference not adversely
affecting the
functioning of the common market to a substantial degree need not be removed or
prevented from arising;
Whereas the Community’s legal framework on the protection of computer
programs can accordingly in the first instance be limited
to establishing that
Member States should accord protection to computer program under copyright law
as literary works and, further,
to establishing who and what should be
protected, the exclusive rights on which protected persons should be able to
rely in order
to authorise or prohibit certain acts and for how long the
protection should apply;
Whereas, for the purpose of this Directive, the term “computer
program” shall include programs in any form, including
those which are
incorporated into hardware, whereas this term also includes preparatory design
work leading to the development of
a computer program provided that the nature
of the preparatory work is such that a computer program can result from it at a
Whereas, in respect of the criteria to be applied in determining whether or
not a computer program is an original work, no tests as
to the qualitative or
aesthetic merits or the program should be applied;
Whereas the Community is fully committed to the promotion of international
standardisation;
Whereas the function of a computer program is to communicate and work
together with other components of a computer system and with
users and, for this
purpose, a logical and, where appropriate, physical interconnection and
interaction is required to permit all
elements of software and hardware to work
with other software and hardware and with users in all the ways in which they
are intended
to function;
Whereas the parts of the program which provide for such interconnection and
interaction between elements of software and hardware
are generally known as
“interfaces”;
Whereas this functional interconnection and interaction is generally known as
“interoperability”; whereas such interoperability
can be defined as
the ability to exchange information and mutually to use the information which
has been exchanged;
Whereas, for the avoidance of doubt, it has to be made clear that only the
expression of a computer program is protected and that
ideas and principles
which underlie any element of a program, including those which underlie its
interfaces, are not protected by
Whereas, in accordance with principle of copyright, to the extent that logic,
algorithms and programming languages comprise ideas
and principles, those ideas
and principles are not protected under this Directive;
Whereas, in accordance with the legislation and jurisprudence of the Member
States and the international copyright conventions, the
expression of those
ideas and principles is to be protected by copyright;
Whereas, for the purposes of this Directive, the term “rental”
means the making available for use, for a limited period
of time and for
profit-making purposes, of a computer program or a copy thereof; whereas this
term does not include public lending,
which, accordingly, remains outside the
scope of this Directive;
Whereas the exclusive rights of the author to prevent the unauthorised
reproduction of his work have to be subject to a limited exception
in the case
of a computer program to allow the reproduction technically necessary for the
use of that program by the lawful acquirer;
Whereas this means that the acts of loading and running necessary for the use
of a copy of a program which has been lawfully acquired,
and the act of
correction of its errors, may not be prohibited by contract; whereas, in the
absence of specific contractual provisions,
including when a copy of the program
has been sold, any other act necessary for the use of the copy of a program may
be performed
in accordance with its intended purpose by a lawful acquirer of
Whereas a person having a right to use a computer program should not be
prevented from performing acts necessary to observe, study
or test the
functioning of the program, provided that these acts do not infringe the
Whereas the unauthorised reproduction, translation, adaptation or
transformation of the form of the code in which a copy of a computer
program has
been made available constitutes an infringement of the exclusive right of the
Whereas, nevertheless, circumstances may exist when such a reproduction of
the code and translation of its form within the meaning
of Article 4(a) and (b)
are indispensable to obtain the necessary information to achieve the
interoperability of an independently
created program with other programs;
Whereas it has therefore to be considered that in these limited circumstances
only, performance of the acts of reproduction and translation
by or on behalf of
a person having a right to use a copy of the program is legitimate and
compatible with fair practice and must
therefore be deemed not to require the
authorisation of the right holder;
Whereas an objective of this exception is to make it possible to connect all
components of a computer system, including those of different
manufacturers, so
that they can work together;
Whereas such an exception to the author’s exclusive rights may not be
used in a way which prejudices the legitimate interests
of the rightholder or
which conflicts with a normal exploitation of the program;
Whereas, in order to remain in accordance with the provisions of the Berne
Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
Works, the term of
protection should be the life of the author and fifty years from the first of
January of the year following the
year of his death or, in the case of an
anonymous or pseudonymous work, 50 years from the first of January of the year
the year in which the work is first published;
Whereas protection of computer programs under copyright laws should be

HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Object of protection
1. In accordance with the provisions of this Directive, Member States shall
protect computer programs, by copyright, as literary works
within the meaning of
the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. For the
purposes of this Directive,
the term “computer program” shall
include their preparatory design material.
2. Protection in accordance with this Directive shall apply to the expression
in any form of a computer program. Ideas and principles
which underlie any
element of a computer program, including those which underlie its interfaces,
are not protected by copyright under
this Directive.
3. A computer program shall be protected if it is original in the sense that
it is the author’s own intellectual creation.
No other criteria shall be
applied to determine its eligibility for protection.
Authorship of computer programs
1. The author of a computer program shall be the natural person or group of
natural persons who has created the program or, where
the legislation of the
Member State permits, the legal person designated as the rightholder by that
legislation. Where collective
works are recognised by the legislation of a
Member State, the person considered by the legislation of the Member State to
have created
the work shall be deemed to be its author.
2. In respect of a computer program created by a group of natural persons
jointly, the exclusive rights shall be owned jointly.
3. Where a computer program is created by an employee in the execution of his
duties or following the instructions given by his employer,
the employer
exclusively shall be entitled to exercise all economic rights in the program so
created, unless otherwise provided by
Beneficiaries of protection
Protection shall be granted to all natural or legal persons eligible under
national copyright legislation as applied to literary works.
Restricted Acts
Subject to the provisions of Articles 5 and 6, the exclusive rights of the
rightholder within the meaning of Article 2, shall include
the right to do or to
(a) the permanent or temporary reproduction of a computer program by any
means and in any form, in part or in whole. Insofar as loading,
displaying,
running, transmission or storage of the computer program necessitate such
reproduction, such acts shall be subject to
authorisation by the
rightholder;
(b) the translation, adaptation, arrangement and any other alteration of a
computer program and the reproduction of the results thereof,
without prejudice
to the rights of the person who alters the program;
(c) any form of distribution to the public, including the rental, of the
original computer program or of copies thereof. The first
sale in the Community
of a copy of a program by the rightholder or with his consent shall exhaust the
distribution right within the
Community of that copy, with the exception of the
right to control further rental of the program or a copy thereof.
Exceptions to the restricted acts
1. In the absence of specific contractual provisions, the acts referred to in
Article 4(a) and (b) shall not require authorisation
by the rightholder where
they are necessary for the use of the computer program by the lawful acquirer in
accordance with its intended
purpose, including for error correction.
2. The making of a back-up copy by a person having a right to use the
computer program may not be prevented by contract insofar as
it is necessary for
3. The person having a right to use a copy of a computer program shall be
entitled, without the authorisation of the rightholder,
to observe, study or
test the functioning of the program in order to determine the ideas and
principles which underlie any element
of the program if he does so while
performing any of the acts of loading, displaying, running, transmitting or
storing the program
which he is entitled to do.
Decompilation
1. The authorisation of the rightholder shall not be required where
reproduction of the code and translation of its form within the
Article 4(a) and (b) are indispensable to obtain the information necessary to
achieve the interoperability of an independently
created computer program with
other programs, provided that the following conditions are met:
(a) these acts are performed by the licensee or by another person having a
right to use a copy of a program, or on their behalf by
a person authorised to
(b) the information necessary to achieve interoperability has not previously
been readily available to the persons referred to in
subparagraph (a); and
(c) these acts are confined to the parts of the original program which are
necessary to achieve interoperability.
2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not permit the information obtained
through its application:
(a) to be used for goals other than to achieve the interoperability of the
independently created computer program;
(b) to be given to others, except when necessary for the interoperability of
the independently created computer program; or
(c) to be used for the development, production or marketing of a computer
program substantially similar in its expression, or for
any other act which
infringes copyright.
3. In accordance with the provisions of the Berne Convention for the
protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the provisions of
this Article may
not be interpreted in such a way as to allow its application to be used in a
manner which unreasonably prejudices
the right holder’s legitimate
interests or conflicts with a normal exploitation of the computer program.
Special measures of protection
1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 4, 5 and 6, Member States
shall provide, in accordance with their national legislation,
appropriate
remedies against a person committing any of the acts listed in subparagraphs
(a), (b), and (c) below:
(a) any act of putting into circulation a copy of a computer program knowing,
or having reason to believe, that it is an infringing
(b) the possession, for commercial purposes, of a copy of a computer program
knowing, or having reason to believe, that it is an infringing
(c) any act of putting into circulation, or the possession for commercial
purposes of, any means the sole intended purpose of which
is to facilitate the
unauthorised removal or circumvention of any technical device which may have
been applied to protect a computer
2. Any infringing copy of a computer program shall be liable to seizure in
accordance with the legislation of the Member State concerned.
3. Member States may provide for the seizure of any means referred to in
paragraph 1(c).
Term of protection
1. Protection shall be granted for the life of the author and for fifty years
after his death or after the death of the last surviving
author; where the
computer program is an anonymous or pseudonymous work, or where a legal person
is designated as the author by national
legislation in accordance with Article
2(1), the term of protection shall be fifty years from the time that the
computer program
is first lawfully made available to the public. The term of
protection shall be deemed to begin on the first of January of the year
following the abovementioned events.
2. Member States which already have a term of protection longer than that
provided for in paragraph 1 are allowed to maintain their
present term until
such time as the term of protection for copyright works is harmonised by
Community law in a more general way.
Continued application of other legal
1. The provisions of this Directive shall be without prejudice to any other
legal provisions such as those concerning patent rights,
trade-marks, unfair
competition, trade secrets, protection of semi-conductor products or the law of
contract. Any contractual provisions
contrary to Article 6 or to the exceptions
provided for in Article 5(2) and (3) shall be null and void.
2. The provisions of this Directive shall apply also to programs created
before 1 January 1993 without prejudice to any acts concluded
acquired before that date.
Final provisions
1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and
administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive
January 1993.
When Member States adopt these measures, the latter shall contain a reference
to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference
on the occasion of
their official publication. The methods of making such a reference shall be
laid down by the Member States.
2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the provisions of
national law which they adopt in the field governed by this
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

The classification of computer programs
N.01 In the Draft Report the content of this appendix was contained in
Chapter 6 in paragraphs 6.05–6.10. While this discussion
has now been
transferred to this appendix reference is made in Chapter 6 to the
recommendations of the Committee deriving from the
classification of computer
programs. As noted in the Draft Report the discussion that follows represents
the Committee’s understanding
of the general classification of computer
N.02 Computer programs can be classified, on the basis of function, into two
groups, namely, operating systems programs and applications

as C, Prolog, Ada or FORTRAN, into low level languages (machine

Applications programs
, on the other hand, are those programs which direct
the computer to perform a task in a particular way.
Machine code and object code
N.03 The Committee notes the potential for confusion caused by the
interchangeable use of the terms machine code and object code.
Machine code
describes the class of languages which can be interpreted directly by
machines without a translation process.
Object code
describes programs
expressed in machine code (and usually containing information in addition to the
machine code necessary to ensure
the correct loading of the program). Since the
preference for the use of the term object code is entrenched in High Court
the Committee has used object code in all situations other than those
where its use would be misleading.
Programming languages
N.04 Programs may be written in any of a large range of programming
languages. These languages may be either specific for a particular
computer or independent of the computer type. Program languages are classified
at different levels; they may be either “high
level” or “low
High level languages
are so called because they are closer
to English in appearance or because they consist of recognisable mathematical or
logical statements.
They are powerful tools in computer programming because they
lend themselves to the precise and unambiguous statement of complex
instructions
in a form readily understood by humans. On the other hand,
, eg, assembler code, are closer to the machine language used by
the computer. However, they still allow the programmer to work with
instructions
expressed in alphabetic characters and decimal numbers rather than binary or
hexadecimal numbers.
Compilation and interpretation
N.05 The two techniques used to run computer programs written in languages
other than machine code are compilation and interpretation.
compilation
the high level language is converted into equivalent
instructions in machine code – the object code. This can be done by a
compiler program (paragraph N.03). A special class of compiler, called an
, generates object code from assembler code. An alternative way
to run a computer program is by using an interpreter program. Assembler
compiler programs operate by converting the entire source code program to object
code before it can run on the computer. An
interpreter program
converts the source code program “on the fly” one instruction at a
time. It does not produce a complete object
code version of the source code
program. On some computers, the object code or machine code is interpreted by
the machine itself
directly. On microprogrammed machines, however, the object
code is interpreted by microprograms, written in a code called
which is at a lower level than conventional machine code.
Microprograms
consist of a series of steps which go to make up an instruction, defining
exactly what each machine instruction does, eg, moving
or examining data. In
other words, microcode programs interpret higher level machine code
instructions.

PART II: STANDARDS CONCERNING THE AVAILABILITY,
SCOPE AND USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Section I: Copyright and related rights
Article 9 Relation to Berne Convention
1. Members shall comply with Articles 1–21 and the Appendix of the
Berne Convention (1971). However, Members shall not have
rights or obligations
under this Agreement in respect of the rights conferred under Article
of that Convention or of the rights derived therefrom.
2. Copyright protection shall extend to expressions and not to ideas,
procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as
Article 10 Computer Programs and Compilations of
1. Computer programs, whether in source or object code, shall be protected as
literary works under the Berne Convention (1971).
2. Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or
other form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement
of their contents
constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such. Such protection,
which shall not extend to the data
or material itself, shall be without
prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or material itself.
Article 11 Rental Rights
In respect of at least computer programs and cinematographic works, a Member
shall provide authors and their successors in title
the right to authorize or to
prohibit the commercial rental to the public of originals or copies of their
shall be excepted from this obligation in respect of
cinematographic works unless such rental has led to widespread copying of such
works which is materially impairing the exclusive right of reproduction
conferred in that Member on authors and their successors
in title. In respect of
computer programs, this obligation does not apply to rentals where the program
itself is not the essential
object of the rental.
Article 13 Limitations and Exceptions
Members shall confine limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights to
certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal
exploitation of the
work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right
PART VI: TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
Article 65 Transitional Arrangements
1. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 below, no Member shall
be obliged to apply the provisions of this Agreement
before the expiry of a
general period of one year following the date of entry into force of the
Agreement Establishing the MTO.
2. Any developing country Member is entitled to delay for a further period of
four years the date of application, as defined in paragraph
1 above, of the
provisions of this Agreement other than Articles 3, 4 and 5 of Part I.
3. Any other Member which is in the process of transformation from a
centrally-planned into a market, free-enterprise economy and
undertaking structural reform of its intellectual property system and facing
special problems in the preparation and implementation
of intellectual property
laws, may also benefit from a period of delay as foreseen in paragraph 2
