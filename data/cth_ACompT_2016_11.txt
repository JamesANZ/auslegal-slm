INTRODUCTION
is an application by SA Power Networks (‘
’), pursuant to
s 71B(1) of the Schedule of the
National Electricity (South Australia)
’), for review of a reviewable
regulatory decision of the Australian Energy Regulator
’), filed with the Australian Competition Tribunal (the
’) on 19 November 2015.
decision under review is the final decision and distribution determination
published by the AER on 29 October 2015 pursuant to
cl 11.60.4(c) of the NER,
entitled ‘Final Decision: SA Power Networks Distribution Determination
2015-16 to 2019-20’
Final Decision
4 May 2016, SAPN was granted leave to apply for review of the Final Decision,
with respect to the designated grounds of review
referred to in an amended
application for review filed with the Tribunal on 3 May 2016 (‘
Application
’). The Tribunal’s reasons for granting leave are
discussed below.
Regulatory regime
is the operator of an electricity distribution network located in South
Australia (‘
South Australian distribution network
’). SAPN is
registered as a distribution network service provider
’) under cl 2.5.1 of the
National Electricity
’), and provides distribution network services
by means of the South Australian distribution network.
6 of the NESA Act applies the
National Electricity Law
’), set out in the Schedule of the Act, as a law of
South Australia. Section 9 of the NEL gives the NER the force of law in
7 of the NEL sets out the national electricity objective
’), which is to promote efficient investment in, and
efficient operation and use of, electricity services for the long-term
of consumers with respect to:
(1) price, quality, safety, reliability and security of
supply of electricity; and
(2) the reliability, safety and security of the national electricity
16(1)(a) of the NEL provides that in performing or exercising an AER economic
regulatory function or power, which includes
a function or power performed or
exercised by the AER relating to the making of a distribution determination, the
AER must perform
or exercise that function or power in a manner that will, or is
likely to, contribute to the achievement of the NEO.
16(1)(d) of the NEL provides that if the AER is making a reviewable regulatory
decision and there are two or more possible
reviewable regulatory decisions that
will, or are likely to, contribute to the achievement of the NEO, the AER
(1) make the decision that the AER is satisfied will, or
is likely to, contribute to the achievement of the NEO to the greatest degree
preferable reviewable regulatory decision
(2) specify reasons as to the basis on which the AER is satisfied that the
decision is the preferable reviewable regulatory
addition, s 16(2)(a) of the NEL requires the AER to take into account the
revenue and pricing principles (‘
’) when exercising a
discretion in making those parts of a distribution determination relating to
direct control network services.
7A of the NEL sets out the RPP, as follows:
(2) A regulated network service provider should be
provided with a reasonable opportunity to recover at least the efficient costs
the operator incurs in–
(a) providing direct control network
services; and
(b) complying with a regulatory obligation or requirement or making a
regulatory payment.
(3) A regulated network service provider should be
provided with effective incentives in order to promote economic efficiency with
respect to direct control network services the operator provides. The economic
efficiency that should be promoted includes–
(a) efficient investment in a
distribution system or transmission system with which the operator provides
direct control network services;
(b) the efficient provision of electricity network services; and
(c) the efficient use of the distribution system or transmission system with
which the operator provides direct control network
(4) Regard should be had to the regulatory asset base
with respect to a distribution system or transmission system
(a) in any previous–
(i) as the case requires,
distribution determination or transmission determination; or
(ii) determination or decision under the National Electricity Code or
earned, or prices
charged, by a person providing services by means of that distribution system or
transmission system; or
(5) A price or charge for the provision of a direct
control network service should allow for a return commensurate with the
and commercial risks involved in providing the direct control network
service to which that price or charge relates.
(6) Regard should be had to the economic costs and risks of the potential for
under and over investment by a regulated network service
provider in, as the
case requires, a distribution system or transmission system with which the
operator provides direct control network
(7) Regard should be had to the economic costs and risks of the potential for
under and over utilisation of a distribution system
or transmission system with
which a regulated network service provider provides direct control network
6.12.1 of the NER provides that a distribution determination is predicated on a
number of constituent decisions to be made
by the AER. These include:
(1) a decision on the DNSP’s building block
proposal in which the AER either approves or refuses to approve the annual
requirement for the DNSP, as set out in the building block proposal, for
each regulatory year of the regulatory control period;
(2) a decision in which the AER either:
(a) acting in accordance with cl 6.5.7(c),
accepts the total of the forecast capital expenditure
’) for the regulatory control period that is included
in the current building block proposal; or
(b) acting in accordance with cl 6.5.7(d), does not accept the total of the
forecast capex for the regulatory control period that
is included in the current
building block proposal, in which case the AER must set out its reasons for that
decision and an estimate
of the total of the DNSP’s required capex for the
regulatory control period that the AER is satisfied reasonably reflects the
capex criteria, taking into account the capex
(3) a decision on the allowed rate of return for each
regulatory year of the regulatory control period in accordance with cl
(4) a decision on the value of imputation credits as referred to in cl 6.5.3;
(5) any other amounts, values or inputs on which the building block
determination is based.
6.12.2 of the NER provides that the reasons given by the AER for a final
distribution determination under r 6.11 must set out
the basis and
rationale of the determination, including:
(1) details of the qualitative and quantitative methods
applied in any calculations and formulae made or used by the AER;
(2) the values adopted by the AER for each of the input variables in any
calculations and formulae, including:
(a) whether those values have been taken or
derived from the provider’s current building block proposal; and
(b) if not, the rationale for the adoption of those
(3) details of any assumptions made by the AER in
undertaking any material qualitative and quantitative analyses; and
(4) reasons for the making of any decisions, the giving or withholding of any
approvals, and the exercise of any discretion, as referred
to in Ch 6 of
the NER, for the purposes of the determination.
exercise of the AER’s discretion in making distribution determinations is
governed by cl 6.12.3 of the NER.
AER distribution determination process
Impact of the 2012 changes to the NER
15 of the NEL prescribes the functions and powers of the AER, which include the
making of distribution determinations under
provisions of the NER relating to distribution determinations were amended by
the Australian Energy Market Commission (‘
’), and were
published, and took effect from on 29 November 2012 (‘
number of revenue determination processes due to be completed in 2014 and 2015
were delayed through transitional provisions inserted
into the NER as part of
the 2012 rule changes (‘
transitional provisions
delay afforded the AER the time to develop ‘Better Regulation’
guidelines in response to the 2012 rule
changes (the ‘
Better Regulation
’). The Better Regulation Guidelines were published in late
aspects of the transitional provisions applying to SAPN’s distribution
determination process are as follows:
(1) the date for submission of SAPN’s regulatory
proposal was delayed by nine months, from 31 January 2014 to 31 October
(2) the AER was not required to publish a draft distribution determination in
relation to SAPN’s regulatory proposal, as it
would have been required to
do under cl 6.10.1 of the NER, in the absence of the transitional arrangements.
Rather, following appropriate
consultation on SAPN’s regulatory proposal,
the AER was able to proceed immediately to making a distribution determination
under cl 6.11.1 of the NER;
(3) at the same time as the AER published its distribution determination under
cl 6.11.1 of the NER (which it was required to by
30 April 2015), it was
required to also publish an invitation for written submissions on the revocation
and substitution of that
distribution determination;
(4) under cl 11.60.4(b) of the NER:
(a) any person was allowed to make a written
submission to the AER in relation to the revocation and substitution of the
distribution
determination within the time period specified by the AER, which
must not be earlier than 45 business days after the making of that
distribution
determination; and
(b) without otherwise limiting the manner in which SAPN’s may make such
submissions, SAPN was allowed to make a submission
in the form of revisions to
the regulatory proposal that it submitted to the AER in relation to the
distribution determination that
(5) by no later than 31 October 2015, the AER was
required to revoke its distribution determination for the 2015-2020 regulatory
period and make a new distribution determination in substitution for the
revoked determination which takes effect as at the date
it is made; and
(6) in making the new distribution determination, the AER was required to have
(a) the matters it would be required to have
regard to if it were making a final distribution determination under
“current Chapter
6” subsequent to it making a draft distribution
determination that is the same as the revoked determination including (except
where (c) below applies) the regulatory proposal that was submitted to the AER
in relation to the revoked determination;
(b) written submissions received in relation to the revocation and substitution
of the distribution determination;
(c) any revisions to the regulatory proposal that was submitted to the AER in
relation to the revoked determination and that are
given to the AER under
cl 11.60.4(b); and
(d) any analysis undertaken by or for the AER that is published prior to the
making of the distribution determination or as part
of the distribution
determination.
SAPN’s regulatory review process
to cl 6.8.2 of the NER (as modified by cl 11.60.3 of the transitional
provisions), SAPN was required to submit, and on 31
October 2014 did submit, a
regulatory proposal to the AER for consideration in accordance with the NER
Regulatory Proposal
30 April 2015, pursuant to cl 6.11.1 of the NER, the AER published a decision
and distribution determination entitled ‘Preliminary
Decision: SA Power
Networks Distribution Determination 2015-16 to 2019-20’
Preliminary Decision
3 July 2015, pursuant to cl 11.60.4(b) of the NER, SAPN submitted a revised
regulatory proposal to the AER for consideration in
accordance with the NER
Revised Proposal
29 October 2015, the AER published its Final Decision, pursuant to cl 11.60.4(c)
of the NER.
19 November 2015, SAPN filed an application for leave and review under
s 71B of the NEL.
LEAVE TO APPLY FOR REVIEW
71B of the NEL provides:
71B – Applications for review
(1) An affected or interested person or body, with the leave of the
Tribunal, may apply to the Tribunal for a review of a reviewable
(2) An application must—
(a) be made in the form and manner determined by the Tribunal; and
(b) specify the grounds for review being relied
Tribunal accepts that, for the purposes of s 71B(1) of the NEL:
(1) SAPN is an “affected or interested person or
body” (as that term is defined in s 71A of the NEL); and
(2) the Final Decision, the decision that is under review in the present
application, is a reviewable regulatory decision, as it
is a network revenue or
pricing determination that sets a regulatory period.
addition, it is accepted that there is no issue that SAPN’s application
for review was made within the 15 business-day time
limit prescribed by s 71D of
application for leave to apply for review was unopposed by the AER.
previously mentioned, on 4 May 2016, SAPN was given leave to apply for review of
the Final Decision on the grounds set out in its
Review Application.
is worth noting that the South Australian Council of Social Service
’) also applied for leave to review the Final
Decision, however the Tribunal dismissed SACOSS’ application for review
2 May 2016: see
Application by South Australian Council of Social Service
Incorporated
[2016] ACompT 8.
Requirements for the leave application
71C of the NEL sets out the following two relevant requirements for applications
made under s 71B of the NEL:
71C – Grounds for review
(1) An application under section 71B(1) may be made only on 1 or more of the
following grounds:
(a) the AER made an error of fact in its
findings of facts, and that error of fact was material to the making of the
(b) the AER made more than 1 error of fact in its findings of facts, and that
those errors of fact, in combination, were material
to the making of the
(c) the exercise of the AER’s discretion was incorrect, having regard
to all the circumstances;
(d) the AER’s decision was unreasonable, having regard to all the
circumstances.
(1a) An application under section 71B(1) must also
specify the manner in which a determination made by the Tribunal varying the
regulatory decision, or setting aside the reviewable regulatory
decision and a fresh decision being made by the AER following remission
matter to the AER by the Tribunal, on the basis of 1 or more grounds raised in
the application, either separately or collectively,
would, or would be likely
to, result in a materially preferable NEO
is worth repeating that, pursuant to s 7 of the NEL, the NEO is to promote
efficient investment in, and efficient operation and
use of, electricity
services for the long-term interests of consumers with respect to:
(1) price, quality, safety, reliability and security of
supply of electricity; and
(2) the reliability, safety and security of the national electricity
Tribunal accepts that SAPN’s Review Application was made only on the
grounds of review specified in s 71C of the NEL.
Tribunal has reached that conclusion having regard to the observations made in
recent Tribunal decisions relating to applications
for limited merits review by
DNSPs in NSW and ACT. For example, the Tribunal accepts that:
... the line between the several available grounds of
review is not necessarily always clear cut. Sometimes, it will be a clear line,
and sometimes it will not. Moreover, there is no prescription in s 71C that, in
particular facts and circumstances, there can be
only one ground of review made
There is also no clear line between factual error, opinion, and discretionary
judgment; one may feed into the other.
... error or errors – if accepted – may be a combination of error
or errors of fact, wrongful exercise of discretion,
and/or the outcome of an
unreasonable decision. Because the characterisation of error or errors, if made
out, will more clearly
emerge in the course of considering the review related
material and the submissions dealing with it, the Tribunal does not consider
appropriate or necessary to embark upon the careful textual analysis and
criticism of the
application at this point to describe the
combination or permutation of alternative expressions of reviewable error in
that application.

the Tribunal has had regard to the matters outlined in SAPN’s submissions
on its application for leave to review (‘
Leave Submissions
and paragraphs [22]-[26] and [200]-[210] of SAPN’s Review Application. In
considering these matters, the Tribunal
accepted, in granting leave to apply for
review, that SAPN had sufficiently addressed the manner in which a determination
Tribunal in accordance with s 71C(1a) of the NEL may result in a
materially preferable designated NEO decision.
Criteria for the grant of leave
to s 71E of the NEL, the Tribunal must not grant leave to apply for review
unless it appears to the Tribunal that:
(a) that there is a serious issue to be heard and
determined as to whether a ground for review set out in section 71C(1) exists;
(b) that the applicant has established a
prima facie
case that a
determination made by the Tribunal varying the reviewable regulatory decision,
or setting aside the reviewable regulatory
decision and a fresh decision being
made by the AER following remission of the matter to the AER by the Tribunal, on
the basis of
1 or more grounds raised in the application, either separately or
collectively, would, or would be likely to, result in a materially
NEO decision.
even where the Tribunal determines that the criteria in s 71E are satisfied,
leave to apply under s 71B must not be granted
“unless the amount that is
specified in or derived from the decision exceeds the lesser of $5,000,000 or 2%
of the average
annual regulated revenue of the regulated network service
provider”: s 71F(2) of the NEL.
Tribunal may also refuse to grant leave on the grounds set out in s 71H(2) of
the NEL, namely that:
(a) without reasonable excuse—
(i) failed to comply with a request (including a request for relevant
information), or a direction, of the AER made under this Law
or the Rules for
the purpose of making the decision; or
(ii) conducted itself in a manner that resulted in the making of the decision
of the AER being delayed; or
(b) misled, or attempted to mislead, the AER on a matter relevant to the
AER’s decision.
is no suggestion, however, by the AER or SAPN that any of the conditions
contained in that provision are present to enliven
the Tribunal’s
discretion to refuse the granting of leave.
of the relevant criteria for leave in s 71E and s 71F(2) of the NEL are
considered below.
Financial threshold (s 71F(2) of the NEL)
affidavit of Luke Woodward affirmed on 19 November 2015, and made in support of
SAPN’s Review Application sets out the 2%
of the average annual regulated
revenue of SAPN over the 2015-2020 regulatory control period specified in or
derived from the Final
Decision as approximately $15.9 million. As such the
relevant threshold pursuant to s 71F(2) is $5 million.

that are the subject of grounds for
review in SAPN’s Review Application. On the basis of these amounts, the
Tribunal considered
that the financial threshold was comfortably

, in relation to the legal
principles relevant to the meaning of “serious issue to be heard and
determined”. These submissions
were accepted in
the following principles were noted as being of
particular relevance:
(a) The phrase ‘serious issue to be heard and
determined’ has been correlated with the phrase ‘serious question
be tried’ in the context of the grant of interlocutory injunctions:
Application by ElectraNet Pty Limited
[2008] ACompT 1
(b) The relevant question is indeed whether an applicant has established that
there is a serious issue to be heard and determined
given the nature of the
rights asserted by the applicant and ‘the practical consequences likely to
flow’ from the grant
of leave. In particular, the Tribunal has previously
expressed the view that the threshold merely requires the applicant to
that there is a sufficient prospect of success to justify in the
circumstances it being given the opportunity’ to have the
Application by Envestra Ltd
[2011] ACompT 12
made extensive submissions on whether there was a serious issue to be tried in
respect of:
(2) allowed rate of return – return on debt
(3) forecast inflation;
(4) forecast bushfire safety capex;
(5) forecast labour cost escalation;
(6) operating expenditure (‘
’) for increased asset
inspections in bushfire risk areas; and
(7) opex for “no access” poles inspections.
SAPN ultimately decided not to apply for review of the final two topics above
relating to opex.
each of these topics, SAPN set out the background to the issue, summarised the
issue as arising in SAPN’s Regulatory Proposal
and in the AER’s
Final Decision, and identified the specific aspects of the relevant grounds of
review to demonstrate that
there was a serious issue to be heard and
determined.
will be apparent from the reasons in respect of each ground of review below,
there were serious issues to be heard and determined
on SAPN’s Review
Application.
Prima facie case on materially preferable NEO decision (s
71E(b) of the NEL)
each of the issues in dispute, SAPN made submissions on how rectification of an
error in the AER’s distribution determination
– if found to be an
error – could result in a materially preferable NEO decision. SAPN then
submitted in its Leave Submissions
The immediate consequence of these errors is that the
overall revenue allowance determined by the AER in its Final Decision is
below that which would be required by an efficient entity to recover
at least efficient costs and provide a commercial market return
to investors
across the 2015-20 regulatory control period. As noted in paragraphs 198 and
199 of the SA Power Networks Application,
these are individually material in
terms of the overall regulated revenue SA Power Networks is permitted to earn,
and in aggregate
are very significant – that is, approximately, a $285.6
million ($nominal) revenue reduction.
SAPN also submitted that if the Final Decision is left uncorrected:
(1) SAPN’s incentives and signals to undertake
investment in the network and operations would be distorted due to a significant
revenue shortfall;
(2) the shortfall in the allowances for the operating and capex may lead to an
inability to recover the efficient costs of meeting
regulatory (or otherwise
appropriate) safety obligations and requirements of the distribution system;
(3) perceptions of regulatory risk will significantly increase; and
(4) it will set a precedent (in the non-technical sense of that term) for
under-compensation of SAPN (and potentially other businesses)
now and in the
Tribunal considered SAPN’s submissions in this respect. The Tribunal was
satisfied that SAPN has made a prima facie case
in accordance with s 71E(b) of
the basis of the above considerations, and as will be apparent further from the
reasons in respect of each of the topics below,
the Tribunal considered it was

consultation process referred to in s 71R(1)(b) of the NEL is an additional
procedural step which the Tribunal must take and,
ideally, be accommodated
within the target time prescribed by s 71Q of the NEL.
Tribunal, having given leave to SAPN to apply for review in this matter on 4 May
2016, sought information from the AER as to groups
or persons who might have an
interest in the Tribunal’s review under s 71R(1)(b) of the NEL.
Tribunal then conducted an extensive communication process with each of those
groups or persons, to invite them to indicate:
(1) whether they wished to consult with the Tribunal in
relation to the Final Decision;
(2) the nature of their proposed participation; and
(3) how the consultation might best be carried out.
determined a protocol for the consultation, the Tribunal issued a Consultation
Agenda under which it provided for those who
wished to speak to the Tribunal on
that occasion either personally or on behalf of an organisation, to do so.
Tribunal conducted the consultation on 1 June 2016 at the Federal Court of
Australia in Adelaide. As there was time remaining
at the end of the
consultation, opportunity was also provided for those who had not registered to
participate, to make submissions
to the Tribunal.
transcript of that consultation process has been included by the Tribunal on its
website. The following is a list of the entities

submissions at the consultation were made on behalf of organisations. For ease
of reference, the contributions will be identified
according to the
organisation, rather than the organisation’s representative.
the AER and the South Australian Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy (the
’) as intervener did not participate in the
consultation process. That was appropriate, of course, because they each
participated
in the hearing before the Tribunal.
the course of the consultation, a number of issues of concern to consumers and
consumer interests were identified and the participants’
submissions fell
into several broad themes. It is, in the view of the Tribunal, helpful to
summarise the submissions made in relation
to the major themes, as identified by
the Tribunal. It is important to note that neither the entirety of the
submissions, nor every
topic raised will be captured, and the broad themes as
identified by the Tribunal will only be in summary form.
is useful to note the starting point from which the majority of the submissions
were made. It was generally submitted that, when
considered according to the
elements of the NEO – price, quality, safety, reliability and security of
supply of electricity
– the only element with which consumers were
dissatisfied was price. As the Bundaberg Regional Irrigators Council
’) submitted:
In terms of the elements of the NEO, BRIG believes
that price is the most important and has the greatest impact on consumers and
long term interests. Price has been neglected in favour of investment in
recent determinations.
in survey of businesses conducted by Business SA, 87% of responses ranked
reduction in electricity prices as most important,
with less than 1% ranking it
as either the lowest, or second lowest priority.
each of the topics for review were referred to at the consultation, those that
received most attention were gamma and taxation,
forecast bushfire safety capex,
and forecast labour cost escalation.
Impact on local industry, businesses and the local
majority of the participants drew connections between the cost of electricity
and its impact on the relevant industry and the
broader community. One of the
key messages of participants was the importance of agriculture in South
Australia, and therefore,
the region’s dependency on irrigation and
electrical energy to operate irrigation for agricultural purposes. Participants
impressed upon the Tribunal the centrality of the agricultural industry to the
region’s prosperity, and therefore the importance
of its protection into
the future. As was submitted by The Better Drinks Co Pty Ltd, the whole
Riverland region relies on what is
pumped out of the river and therefore it
affects all industries in the area. Participants also submitted that with other
local industries,
such as manufacturing, shrinking, more pressure was placed on
agricultural industries to keep the local economy healthy.
participants identified specific ways in which the cost of electricity impacted
not only on their own businesses but also more
broadly on the local industry
and, as a result, the local community. For example, Central Irrigation Trust
submitted that to absorb
the higher costs of electricity, the business were
required to either run down assets or reduce opex or capex. National
Irrigators’
Council submitted that, for many businesses, the only place
that increasing electricity prices could be “worn” was in
the number of employees of the business. This had the ripple effect on
households, already struggling with “some
of the world’s highest
energy prices”, which necessarily had to reduce their spending at local
shops and restaurants,
in turn harming the other local industries. Similarly,
BRIG submitted that:
The intentional optimization and deliberate gaming of
network profitability has resulted in a rate of price escalation that is
and is harming business and domestic consumers across the NEM with
standards of living suffering appreciably and less money available
reinvestment in our farms.
a number of participants outlined the measures they were taking to manage
increasing electricity prices, improve efficiency
and remain competitive,
several participants noted that electricity prices were something beyond the
consumers’ control. South
Australian Financial Counsellors Association
’) submitted that the steep increase in electricity
prices during the previous regulatory period had not been matched by the
community’s capacity to pay.
number of participants described the “Swiss cheese” effect of
increased electricity prices, being that higher electricity
prices were forcing
some consumers to seek alternative sources of energy “off the grid”.
In the long run however, this
would mean fewer consumers to pay for the network.
It was in this context that participants submitted that from a policy
perspective,
increasing electricity prices which drove consumers away from the
grid seemed an “absurd” strategy for SAPN itself.
Competition in international and domestic markets
participants addressed the Tribunal on how increasing electricity prices, and
energy costs in general, had, and would continue
to undermine the
competitiveness of South Australian businesses if something was not done to
address them. The high export rate
of produce from irrigated agriculture in
South Australia meant that the almond, wine and juice producers were competing
with producers
from Chile, Argentina, South Africa, North America and across
Europe. Therefore, to continue to be a significant wealth generator
Australia, agriculture producers would have to remain competitive both
domestically and internationally.
businesses such as The Better Drinks Co Pty Ltd, which operated in a highly
competitive market both domestically and internationally,
it was submitted that
there was a very limited ability to pass on increased costs to its customers,
and so the increase in costs
had to be absorbed by business itself. Central
Irrigation Trust submitted that Australia’s competitive advantage was
quickly squandered through rising energy costs. Business SA submitted
that the pending structural change on South Australia’s
economy with the
exit of the automotive manufacturing industry in 2017 provided further impetus
for energy costs to not contribute
to an already uncompetitive cost base,
compared with interstate and international competitors.
Long term interests of the consumer
notion of the “long term interests of consumers”
’), as the factor underpinning the NEO, was a focal
point of many of the submissions. In considering the factors relevant to
LTIC, UnitingCare Australia and Uniting Communities
UnitingCare
’) sought to juxtapose the
“supply-side” perspective of the LTIC contended for in SAPN’s
Review Application
with the “demand-side” perspective of network
users. Therefore, it was submitted that the elements of the LTIC, as specified
in the NEO, should be interpreted in the following way:
– end consumer pays no more than is necessary;
Reliability
– all consumers are able to afford to pay for the essential use of
electricity needed to participate in contemporary society,
and that people will
not be cut off from electricity supply for essential purposes because it is too
– prices as well as supply are stable with no supply-side or bill
a person’s house is not at risk of burning down because they
cannot use electricity for safe lighting, cooking or heating or
other unsafe
practises considered in the absence of supply.
Consumers Australia (‘
’) also directed some of their
submissions to considering the appropriate interpretation of LTIC. ECA
submitted that the question
for interpretation is whether
“efficiency” is the goal, and LTIC is just a signpost to balancing
items, or whether LTIC
is the goal, and efficiency is the means to achieve it.
In developing its interpretation, ECA submitted that the objective of the
regulatory regime is to deliver the outcomes that are equivalent to those that
would be delivered if there were competition achieved
in the electricity market.
ECA identified such outcomes as the consumer interests, price, quality, safety,
reliable and secure supply
services – in essence, the elements of the NEO,
through which the LTIC must be achieved.
Impact on SAPN
of the participants submitted that SAPN’s Regulatory Proposal would
ultimately work against SAPN’s interests as it
would force a significant
proportion of consumers off the grid through increased prices. This would
thereby reduce SAPN’s
customer base and impact on its ability to run its
business. A number of participants noted that they were investigating
alternative
energy sources to run their businesses such as through diesel
generation and solar energy.
Taxation and gamma
issue raised by a number of the participants at the consultation was the amount
of tax paid by SAPN. Many consumers called for
an explanation for why consumers
were paying for an income tax equivalent of “over $400 million”
when, as the participants
submitted, it did not appear to reflect the amount of
tax SAPN was actually paying. As UnitingCare submitted, the Consumer Challenge
Panel (established by the AER to assist with the AER’s regulatory
determinations) noted that SAPN has historically paid minimal
Australian government despite increases in the regulatory revenue allowance from
2011. UnitingCare emphasised that it
was not suggesting anything improper on
the part of SAPN. However, it raised the issue to ensure consumers were not
paying more
as a result of a “more-than-generous” credit arrangement
in favour of SAPN.
seeking clarity and transparency around the amount of tax paid by SAPN, the
participants also called for an indication of taxation
allowances for privately
owned distributors to determine whether this properly represented their actual
tax costs. In support of
this submission, National Irrigators’ Council
referred to the Minister’s criticism of SAPN for making “super
from its customers.
Utilities Advocacy Centre (‘
’) considered the
relationship between gamma and the LTIC in two respects. First, submitting that
the value for gamma proposed
by SAPN “relies on a single methodology that
produces statistically unstable results because it is highly sensitive to
assumptions”, CUAC urged the Tribunal to consider
whether it is in the best interests of consumers for
the regulator to rely on this single measure and methodology, rather than
considering
a wider range of evidence drawn from different methodologies to
produce a more robust value for gamma, as has been done by the AER
guideline paper.
CUAC noted the recent changes in the NEL, as stated in the second reading speech
of the Statues Amendment (National Electricity
and Gas Laws – Limited
Merits Review) Bill 2013, which sought to ensure
consumers do not pay more than necessary for the
quality, safety, reliability and security of supply of electricity and natural
under the national energy laws.
CUAC queried how this would be reflected and implemented if SAPN’s own
estimate of their proposed gamma value would
cost consumers $85.2 million over
the 2015-2020 period.
Irrigation Trust submitted that the effect of the AER’s determination in
the Final Decision in respect of gamma was
viewed to be a transfer of money from
their own business to SAPN. Renmark Irrigation highlighted that even small
changes in the
value of gamma would mean “big returns” for SAPN. It
was considered to be in the best interests of consumers for the
gamma methodology to be ratified by the Tribunal.
Energy Users (‘
’) considered gamma in the context of the
incentive nature of the regime. MEU submitted that not only have companies been
to invest in SAPN with a gamma of 0.5 or 0.4 over many years, but it was
also submitted that the current owner of SAPN was prepared
to invest in the
distributor with a gamma of 0.4. It followed, on MEU’s submission, that
there was no reason to change it
as a disincentive could not be
identified.
Capex and opex
raising issues about the specific topics for review, a number of participants
voiced concerns about capex and opex generally.
SA submitted that a broad concern was that substantial increases in the
AER’s determination both in relation to capex
and opex will lock in
significant additional electricity costs over the next five years and beyond, as
they would be incorporated
into the regulatory asset base and opex used in
future calculations. It was further submitted by Business SA that it considered
it to be “inconceivable” for capex and opex to be increasing as it
submitted that the demand on the electricity network
was static, if not in
decline. More fundamentally, SACOSS expressed concern that SAPN was attempting
to expand the meaning of its
regulatory obligations to justify additional
expenditure in relation to capex and opex.
a connection with the concern around consumers abandoning the network in favour
of alternative energy sources, Riverland Energy
Association posed the question
of who would be paying for existing and new assets proposed by SAPN if future
customers would be seeking
alternative energy sources and deserting the
traditional network supply base.
Forecast bushfire safety capex
of the main issues raised by participants at the consultation in relation to the
bushfire mitigation capex was the absence of
legislative changes by the South
Australian government to warrant or require SAPN’s increase in spending on
bushfire mitigation
over the relevant regulatory period. SACOSS submitted that
the AER was correct to conclude that the regulatory obligations imposed
Electricity Act 1996
Electricity Act
Work Health and Safety Act 2012
relation to the bushfire mitigation measures had not been expanded by the
outcome of the Victorian Bushfire Royal Commission
and Powerline Bushfire Safety
Taskforce, as had been suggested by SAPN. Further, SACOSS submitted that, in
any event, SAPN had failed
to demonstrate how the additional expenditure
proposed in their Regulatory Proposal was prudent and efficient. Similarly, MEU
that the amount allowed for bushfire mitigation capex should not
simply be the cost of service but what is efficient.
SA submitted that as SAPN’s proposal on bushfire mitigation capex had been
made independent of comprehensive policy
consideration, it did not represent
optimal public policy outcomes. Participants warned against allowing SAPN to
become an “arbiter”
on what constitutes good industry practice in
relation to bushfire mitigation, and disregarding the AER’s views on the
that is “merely” an economic regulator. MEU submitted that
such an approach would risk shifting from an incentive-based
regime, which was
specifically required by the legislation, to a regime driven by cost of service.
contrasting perspective was provided by the South Australian Chapter of the
Electricity Energy Society of Australia (‘
acknowledged that SAPN had been achieving good results in bushfire mitigation
controls. However, EESA submitted that
SAPN, with whom lay a large portion of
the responsibility for protecting the community during bushfires, had to
demonstrate continuous
improvement to its practices to address “reasonably
foreseeable” events causing bushfires. Otherwise, as EESA submitted,
organisations would become vulnerable to litigation, particularly in light of
the findings and changes brought about in this
sphere following the Victorian
Bushfires Royal Commission. It was submitted that the cost of litigation in
circumstances where negligence
and the “reasonable foreseeability”
test were made out, would be in excess of $12 million. In light of this, and
public expectation that EESA considered existed for such measures to be
implemented, EESA contended for the program of bushfire mitigation
proposed by
SAPN to be approved.
Forecast labour cost escalation
labour cost escalation received significant attention during the consultation.
Participants submitted that SAPN’s
proposal to increase the terms of the
enterprise bargaining agreement (‘
’) governing SAPN’s employees was at odds
commercially with other EAs across Australia, particularly in light of what
considered to be already favourable EA terms. A number of participants queried
why increases in allowances for labour costs
would be required where there had
been no indication of increases in productivity. As CUAC submitted:
It is questionable whether any increases in real
labour price growth are appropriate – and in the long term interests of
– without a corresponding increase in productivity growth. As
stated by in the
[Victorian Energy Consumer and User Alliance]
submission, “productivity and labour price increases are inextricably
linked”. This is particularly pertinent given that
the AER has accepted
the networks in both states have proposed zero productivity growth (with the
exception of Jemena in Victoria),
despite the significant capital expenditure
over the previous period. CUAC notes that SAPN proposed that the AER adopt
productivity growth forecasts in its alternative estimate of
SA submitted that while the shareholders in SAPN were free to remunerate their
labour force as they saw fit, electricity
consumers would not be willing to
absorb any costs considered above the efficient rate in relation to market
conditions in South
noted its support for the AER’s decision to use the wage price index to
escalate cost rather than basing the escalation
on SAPN’s EA. MEU
identified the risk with allowing SAPN to determine the escalation, rather than
using an external benchmark:
there would be no competitive pressure on SAPN to
negotiate an EA on terms most favourable to consumers. This is particularly the
case given that, as MEU submitted, without an external competitor, the unions,
with whom SAPN would be negotiating, could argue that
the business could just
pass on its costs to clients.
further submitted that, if an error in the AER’s decision were identified,
the Tribunal should still consider whether,
in any event, it would be a
materially preferable NEO decision to reverse the AER’s decision when the
reviewable regulatory
decision was considered as a whole.
Consumer engagement
2012 rules changes required DNSPs to improve their engagement with electricity
consumers to ensure that capex and opex forecasts
include expenditure to address
consumers’ concerns. The consumer engagement process
’) conducted by SAPN received some criticism from
participants. Riverland Energy Association contended that the
“cornerstone”
of SAPN’s Review Application was based on the
AER failing to giving significant weighting to the views of the consumer
in SAPN’s CEP. However, Riverland Energy Association identified
the methods adopted by SAPN for determining the consumers’
priorities to
be self-fulfilling “in the extreme”. SACOSS claimed, both at the
consultation and in written submissions
filed with the Tribunal subsequently,
that as the CEP undertaken by SAPN was conducted in respect of areas not the
subject of review
before the Tribunal, it should be not be relied upon by SAPN
to demonstrate the LTIC, nor be given any weight in the Tribunal’s
considerations in this review. SACOSS submitted that its only relevance was to
highlighting the consumer concern about potential
cost increases, and directed
the Tribunal’s attention to SAPN’s research findings relating to the
consumers’ willingness
to pay, namely that:
there is significant community concern about
potential cost increases. Half of the customers surveyed are very concerned
prospect of rising electricity costs.
also identified problems with consumer engagement in the regulated energy
distribution sphere more generally. For example, it
was claimed that there was
insufficient time to engage with consumers, consumers had inadequate knowledge
to be able to make an informed
contribution or recommendation, and the majority
of time spent engaging with consumers was explaining the role of a network
distributor,
and distinguishing it from a network retailer. MEU considered this
to be detracting from a discussion of the substantive issues.
Role of the Tribunal and the regulatory process
Participants
also addressed the Tribunal on their perceptions of the regulatory process and
what they considered to be the role of
the Tribunal in the process.
number of participants articulated that they saw the Tribunal as a “final
backstop for consumers.” One participant “challenged”
Tribunal to bring electricity prices in South Australia back to the bottom
quartile of prices amongst countries forming the Organisation
for Economic
Co-operation and Development (‘
’). SAFCA submitted that
for the Tribunal to achieve the materially preferable NEO decision, it is
required to take into account
real-life experiences of large numbers of low and
modest income households.
comments were made about the regulatory process more generally. Some
participants submitted that they felt let down by the regulatory
process given
the sharp rise in SAPN tariffs over the last regulatory period. UnitingCare
submitted that consumer behaviour over
recent years put paid to the notion that
regulation of network monopolies successfully functioned as a proxy for
competitive and
efficient markets. UnitingCare cited a number of statistics to
support this argument, including that:
31,666 South
Australian households had an electricity debt, with the average debt being
3,174 South
Australian small businesses had an electricity debt, with the average debt being
$1,559; and
South Australia
has highest rate of energy customers on hardship programs.
also expressed their dissatisfaction with the regulatory process:
The network price setting process is deeply flawed.
In BRIG’s experience, it has been a one sided process that has no regard
for impact on consumers or the wider economy. If the AER’s increased
powers are greatly reduced by the decisions of this Tribunal,
we fear this will
continue to be the case.
relation to the regulatory review process, participants submitted that they
considered it to be adversarial, intimidating and complex.
Others noted that as
it took significant time to understand the technical and complex concepts such
as theta, gamma, and regulatory
asset bases, the process itself became costly
and time consuming for businesses to participate in it effectively.
incentive-focus of the regulatory regime was also raised as an issue. MEU
contended that the AEMC “cleverly” characterised
the LTIC as being
achieved by ensuring there is incentive for investors to invest in the networks,
and disincentive when investment
is not required. MEU considered that this
emphasis on investment and investors took the focus away from the interests of
the consumers
who were required to pay for the network services and the impact
that electricity prices had on their daily lives.
devoted a significant portion of their submissions to the new limited merits
review process, addressing what they considered to
be intended from the
introduction of the process. For example, ECA submitted that while SAPN does
have a responsibility to meet
its regulatory and other obligations, the question
before the Tribunal is whether SAPN’s Regulatory Proposal represents the
most efficient way of meeting such responsibilities and obligations. In this
respect, ECA referred to the aim of the energy market
reforms, identified by the
(former) Standing Council on Energy and Resources (now COAG Energy Council), to
“restore the focus
of the electricity market on serving the long term
interests of consumers”.
also contrasted this case before the Tribunal with that of a NSW and ACT
proceeding with respect to the absence of a consumer
advocacy group as a party
to the proceeding, noting that in
Applications by Public Interest Advocacy
Centre Ltd and Ausgrid
[2016] ACompT 1
’), the Tribunal held at [64]:
Given the role of PIAC, and the relevance of its
submissions to the Tribunal’s functions and responsibilities under the
legislation,
the Tribunal has not needed in these matters to address separately
the matters which emerged in the course of the consultation process.
and submissions of PIAC have encompassed those matters.
ECA submitted that it was particularly important for the Tribunal
to carefully consider and place weight on the submissions of SACOSS
put forward
in the consultation.
Relevantly,
in its written submissions, SACOSS urged the Tribunal to continue to
consider its consultation obligations once the
parties have had an opportunity to respond to matters raised at the public
demonstrates in its reasons for decision on the review how the
submissions made through the consultation process have been considered
going to this issue, the Tribunal makes mention of the submissions of the
Minister. It was the Minister’s contention
that the Tribunal should
affirm the Final Decision. In the course of these reasons, the Tribunal
traverses the issues raised by
the Minister, although without specific
attribution to the Minister as intervenor. These issues were effectively argued
SAPN and the AER, and need no repetition. Nevertheless, one submission
of the Minister does require specific mention relevant to
the consultation
Minister submitted that the efforts of the consumers who took the time to
participate in the community consultation should be
recognised and their
submissions to the Tribunal must be considered as part of the review. The
Tribunal accepts this submission,
and acknowledges that the participants in the
consultation took time out of their own businesses and life to be part of the
representing various consumer interests.
light of the ultimate decision of the Tribunal, it is unnecessary to otherwise
comment on the Minister's helpful submissions.
should also be observed, as the following reasons indicate, the decision of the
Tribunal has been reached on the basis of the contentions
made by SAPN and the
AER, and not by direct reference to submissions made during the consultation
process. This is not because such
submissions are not relevant to the review,
but because in this review the decision to affirm the Final Decision has been
arrived at by focussing on the submission of the parties and in
determining whether any error had occurred on the part of the AER.
Nevertheless, the consultation process and the submissions of consumers (and the
Minister) may have become particularly significant
(if error had been found in
the Final Decision) in the consideration of the materially preferable NEO
decision. This has been unnecessary
in this review as no error has been found
GROUNDS OF REVIEW
has identified multiple grounds of review in respect of each of the topics for
Application by ATCO Gas Australia Pty Ltd
[2016] ACompT 10
’), the Tribunal outlined the nature and
scope of each of the relevant grounds of review: error or errors of fact,
exercise of discretion, and that the decision under review is
unreasonable: see
2016 at [36]-[48]. The Tribunal considers these
principles to be applicable in respect of the present application by SAPN.
Tribunal now turns to consider in detail each ground of review by reference to
the submissions of the parties. There was a substantial
degree of repetition
and overlap in the submissions dealing with each ground of review, and the
Tribunal has attempted to address
the significant and determinative issues to
arrive at its decision.
Cost of corporate income tax (gamma)
is one of the required parameter inputs into the post -tax revenue model
’) used under the NER for the determination of
allowable revenues for a DNSP. It represents the “value” of
(tax) credits arising from company tax payments which are distributed
with dividends to shareholders. These can be expected to reduce
the required
return on equity of shareholders (relative to receiving returns without such tax
credits attached).
in the PTRM, rather than applying an estimated value of gamma to adjust the
required rate of return on equity, the estimate
is instead applied to reducing
the revenue required to compensate the company for corporate tax paid.
Consequently the return on
equity incorporated into the allowed rate of return
is calculated ignoring the imputation credit component of returns to
shareholders.
This approach draws on a demonstration by Professor Bob Officer
(The Cost of Capital of a Company under an Imputation Tax System,
Accounting and
Finance, May 1994) of the equivalence of several such alternative approaches to
valuation of company cash flow streams.
gamma is unobservable, and also because of conflicting interpretations of the
word “value” in its definition,
there has been ongoing debate over
the appropriate numerical value to use in the PTRM. In its Final Decision, the
AER applied a
value for gamma of 0.4, whereas the applicant SAPN argued for a
value of 0.25. This difference has a significant negative impact
allowable revenue for SAPN over the regulatory control period which it estimates
to amount to $85.2 million. The AER argues
that the effect would be less than
this because of the need to adjust other parameters accordingly in the PTRM, as
discussed later.
SAPN argues that the AER made errors in determining to use a
value of 0.4 for gamma, and contends that it should have accepted the
value of 0.25.
same issue arose in the 2015 determinations by the AER for the NSW DNSPs, which
was also appealed to the Tribunal by the affected
parties (arguing for a gamma
value of 0.25 rather than the AER’s use of 0.4). That (differently
constituted) Tribunal ruled
on 26 February 2016 in the
decision in favour of the applicants, and remitted the matter back to the AER to
recalculate allowable revenues using a gamma value
of 0.25. The AER has, in
turn, appealed that decision to the Full Court of the Federal Court. No
determination has yet been made
by the Full Court.
Tribunal determined that despite the existence of that appeal, it was
appropriate for it to hear this review rather than leave
the matter to be
determined conditional on the outcome of the hearing of the Full Court of the
Federal Court. The Tribunal has a
legislative responsibility to hear and
determine the review (within a statutorily delineated period of time), and
should proceed
accordingly.
was also contended by SAPN that this Tribunal should follow the
decision, or alternatively, treat it as highly persuasive. Undoubtedly, each
differently constituted Tribunal should consider the
importance of consistency
between Tribunal decisions, but this is not the sole determinative factor nor is
consistency an unqualified
value. Consistency may lead to arbitrariness of
decision-making, and may not produce the correct legal and just result in the
case before the Tribunal. Each Tribunal, considering the application
before it, and dealing with the relevant parties, must in accordance
law, the issues before it, and the evidence, consider and determine the matters
raised before the Tribunal.
is to be recalled the Tribunal is an administrative decision-maker, not a court
of law. The Tribunal cannot conclusively decide
questions of law. The general
statements of principle the Tribunal articulates will not and cannot have the
same force as the development
of principles of general law determined by the
courts. The function of the Tribunal is a reviewer of decisions, and is not a
decision-maker. The Tribunal has a responsibility to determine
individual cases based upon the evidence and arguments put before
Tribunal proceeds accordingly.
The role of gamma in the PTRM
NER (r 6.3) specify that the DNSP’s revenue requirement is to be
calculated using the “building block” approach.
Rule 6.4 provides
detail on the building block components. Two components are relevant in this
matter. One is the allowed rate
of return on capital which is to be calculated
in accordance with cl 6.5.2. The NER (cl 6.5.2(d)(2)) specifies that the
rate of return “must be ... determined on a nominal vanilla basis
that is consistent with the estimate of the value of imputation
credits referred
to in clause 6.5.3.” The second component (cl 6.4.3(b)(4)) is that
“the estimated cost of corporate
income tax is determined in accordance
with clause 6.5.3”.
6.5.3 of the NER states that:
The estimated cost of corporate income tax of a
Distribution Network Service Provider for each regulatory year (ETC
must be estimated in accordance with the following formula:
is an estimate of the taxable income for that regulatory year
that would be earned by a benchmark efficient entity as a result of
provision of standard control services if such an entity, rather than the
Distribution Network Service Provider, operated the
business of the Distribution
Network Service Provider, such estimate being determined in accordance with the
post-tax revenue model;
is the expected statutory income tax rate for that regulatory
year as determined by the AER; and
γ is the value of imputation credits.
the value of imputation credits provided to shareholders is deducted from that
part of the allowed cash flows required to meet
tax obligations. Under the
“vanilla” WACC approach, those tax obligations are calculated after
allowing for the effect
of the tax deductibility of interest on debt.
Consistency of approach means that the allowed rate of return on the regulatory
base (another component of allowed cash flows) is calculated as a
“vanilla” WACC. This is a weighted average of a cost
of debt (pre
company tax – ie ignoring the tax deductibility of interest at the company
level) and the cost of equity (ignoring
returns to shareholders in the form of
imputation credits). This “vanilla” WACC is also used to convert
cash flows over,
and the regulatory asset base at the end of, the regulatory
control period to a present value to achieve a zero NPV condition for
set of revenues or prices over the regulatory control period.
“vanilla” WACC approach, for use under an imputation tax system, has
its genesis in the aforementioned paper by Professor
Officer, in which he
demonstrated the equivalence of a zero NPV condition for a set of future cash
flows under alternative approaches.
One was the “vanilla WACC”
approach in which net cash flows to be valued have company tax payments
(allowing for tax
deductibility of interest) deducted. This involved company
tax being defined as net of the value of imputation credits distributed
shareholders. For consistency, required rates of return (the discount rates)
ignore personal tax consequences, including the
effects of imputation. Among
the alternative approaches was a dividend imputation version of the standard
textbook approach. In
that, cash flows are calculated, after company tax,
“as if” the company were unlevered, such that there is no tax
for debt interest allowed. Rather, the required return on debt is the
after-company-tax cost of debt. Moreover, the company tax
figure ignores
imputation credit implications, and the required return on equity is lowered by
some amount related to the value of
imputation credits.
important considerations flow from this. One is whether the nature of the
Officer approach has explicit implications for the
interpretation of the term
“value of imputation credits” used in the PTRM and the NER. The
second is how a “value”
of imputation credits should be estimated
given the interpretation which is (or should be) adopted. These are the two

Regulatory background
dispute over gamma needs to be placed in the context of changes made to the NER
in November 2012 which changed the terminology
used to describe gamma. Prior to
that change, gamma was defined as “the assumed utilisation of franking
credits”. Subsequently
it has been defined (NER cl 6.5.3) as “the
value of imputation credits”. No specific definition of what that term
or how it is to be estimated, is given, other than that it needs to be
consistent with the “vanilla WACC” approach.
rule changes also gave increased flexibility to the regulator in determination
of the value to be chosen for gamma. “The
current prescription of the
gamma value of 0.5 in clause 6A.6.4 has also been removed to allow the regulator
the ability to estimate
an appropriate value that reflects the best available
evidence at the time of a decision and would therefore result in a rate of
return that meets the overall objective.” (AEMC, Rule Determination:

Providers) Rule 2012, p 68).

its initial proposal, SAPN proposed a value for gamma of 0.25, calculated as the
product of a distribution rate of 0.7 and a “theta”
(“the value of distributed imputation credits to investors who receive
them”: SAPN, Regulatory Proposal, p 320)
of 0.35. It noted that the
latter figure (0.35) was different to that contained in the AER Rate of Return
Guideline (‘
ROR Guideline
(where 0.7 is proposed)
and also argued that the interpretation adopted by the AER of the “value
of imputation credits”
in those guidelines was incorrect.
argued that the AER had inappropriately discarded a correct (in SAPN’s
view) prior approach which interpreted theta as the
imputation credits, and which led to emphasis being given in its estimation to
“market value studies”
(such as dividend drop-off studies). Instead
it had adopted an approach based on a “utilisation” rate. SAPN
that rather than seeking to estimate the value of distributed imputation
credits, the AER instead seeks to estimate what it refers
before-personal-tax reduction in company tax per one dollar of imputation
credits that the representative investor
receives”. Elsewhere in the
Explanatory Statement, the AER refers to its conceptual definition of theta as
“the expected
ability of equity holders to use the imputation credits they
receive to reduce their personal tax”. (The references are to
Explanatory Statement: Rate of Return Guideline, December 2013, pp 165 and 174
respectively). By incorrectly (in SAPN’s
view) adopting this approach,
the AER placed more weight on information from equity ownership and tax
statistics than market value
is worth referring back to the Explanatory Statement of the ROR Guideline (pp
166-7) from which those statements have been extracted,
since fuller reading of
the document makes clear both the AER’s approach and conceptualisation of
theta, and also its perspective
on earlier interpretations of gamma and theta by
the Tribunal and others:
We consider the relationship between the
representative investor in the market and the implied representative investor
from estimation
methods such as tax studies and dividend drop off studies). We
consider this relationship is critical in assessing what we are estimating
which estimation methods are fit for purpose.
To answer the question of the appropriate representative investor, we
considered afresh:
* the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM framework under
imputation as derived in Officer, Monkhouse, Lally and Van Zijl, and
* analysis of this conceptual framework by academic experts
* the construction of the corporate tax building block in the rules and how
this interacts with the Officer framework used within
the rate of
Our analysis of these issues is set out in section
9.3.1, and further in appendix H. Having undertaken this analysis, we conclude
that we did not fully adopt or address important aspects of this analysis during
the 2009 WACC review. As a result, the Tribunal
review focused only on the
particular suitability of tax value studies and dividend drop off studies. This
was with an incomplete
conceptual framework. The Tribunal acknowledged this
incomplete framework at several points in its reasons.
We conclude that the representative investor:
* Is the weighted average of investors
within the defined market, where the weightings reflect market participation
(equity ownership
value) and risk aversion.
* In this context, the defined market is investors in Australian equity,
either domestic or foreign.
* Is the representative investor at any hypothetical point during a trading
year – that is, it does not disproportionately reflect
an investor or set
of investors at a particular point in time. This is because investors may
invest at any point during the year.
If a benchmark parameter is set using data
from a short period in systematically different trading circumstances to the
the year, it produces an estimate that is only relevant to those
circumstances.
Having reached this view, we consider it has
important implications for the practical task of estimating the value of
imputation credits.
The most important implication of this relationship is that
the source of evidence the Tribunal adopted for the utilisation rate
(a dividend
drop off study) does not produce an estimate for the representative investor.
This is because dividend drop-off studies
give the value weighted
investor’s valuation of imputation credits:
* Based on the combined package of
imputation credits, dividends, and other entitlements (unless adjusted for).
That is, a value
for imputation credits is not available via simple observation
of the dividend drop off in these studies. The implied values for
the franking
credit and the cash component must be econometrically separated, which is
difficult to do reliably. We discuss this
further in appendix H.
* For trades around the time of dividend distribution – that is, these
studies only reflect trading around the cum-dividend
and ex-dividend
its preliminary decision, the AER rejected SAPN’s proposal and determined
that the value attributed to gamma should be 0.4,
which was a departure from its
ROR Guideline figure of 0.5. It explained that change as reflecting the
available current information,
and being based primarily on data from equity
ownership and taxation statistics. These indicate (respectively) potential and
utilisation of imputation credits. The AER argued that little weight
should be given to market value studies due to a range of factors
potentially
affecting the robustness and interpretation of their results. The AER also
departed from its ROR Guideline in dropping
from the list of alternative
approaches the “conceptual guidelines” approach. The preliminary
decision incorporated
an extensive evaluation of alternative approaches to
estimation of gamma and arguments provided by a range of experts and related
its response to the preliminary decision and revised proposal, SAPN maintained
its position that the value attributed to gamma
should be 0.25, and provided
additional expert reports in support of its position (and critical of the AER
preliminary decision).
It noted (SAPN, Revised Proposal, pp 370-1)
There are two fundamental differences of view that
explain how SA Power Networks’ approach differs so substantially from that
of the AER:
first fundamental difference of approach concerns what is meant by the term
‘value of imputation credits’ in rule
6.5.3. SA Power Networks and
its advisors have consistently contended that this term must mean the valuation
revealed in openly
traded equity markets. The reasons for this view are
explained at section (a) below. By contrast, in a range of regulatory documents
published over the past five years the AER and its consultants have advanced
one, two, three and even more formulations of argument
and explanation that seek
to bridge the gap between the reference in the Rules to a ‘value’,
on the one hand, and the
AER’s preferred measure of the redemption rate
second fundamental difference of approach concerns the set of comparator
businesses that should be used when establishing a benchmark
distribution rate.
There are two key differences. First, the AER takes the view that the data for
the distribution rate and the
data for the valuation of imputation credits need
to be drawn from the same set of firms. ... Secondly, even if it were
appropriate
to look at a limited group of ‘comparator firms’ the
AER’s approach to selecting that subset is inconsistent over
inconsistent with other aspects of its approach to rate of return regulation.
fundamental differences underpin the current dispute between SAPN and the AER
(as well as being those considered by a previous
Tribunal in the
its Final Decision, the AER maintained its position on the appropriate value of
gamma being 0.4. The AER (Final Decision, Attachment
4, pp 6-7) notes
“[t]here is no consensus among experts on the appropriate value or
estimation techniques to use. Further,
with each estimation technique there are
often a number of ways these may be applied resulting in different
outcomes.” The
AER also noted the commonality of proposals from a wide
range of service providers and that the value of gamma was one issue currently
(at that time) subject to appeal by other service providers to the Tribunal. It
concluded at p 18 that “[o]verall, the evidence
suggests that a reasonable
estimate of the value of imputation credits is within the range 0.3 to 0.5.
From within this range, we
choose a value of 0.4”, and justified that
choice by the greater weight it placed on data from equity ownership and
statistics than on market value studies (such as dividend drop-off
studies). The AER did not provide specific individual estimates
for the two
components of gamma (ie the distribution rate (F) and the value of imputation
credits (theta)).
reaching its decision, the AER adopted a clear position on the interpretation of
the term “value of imputation credits”.
The AER based its decision
on the view that “the value of imputation credits in NER cl 6.5.3 is the
value of imputation credits
to investors which, within the Officer framework, is
the proportion of company tax returned to investors through the utilisation
imputation credits” (AER’s Outline of Submissions, para 35).
implementing that approach, the AER adopted a method for calculating gamma which
involves multiplying the distribution rate (or
payout ratio, “F”) by
the utilisation rate (“θ” or theta). There is disagreement
over how best to calculate
these two numbers, and whether “θ”
should be interpreted as a utilisation rate or an implied market price of
credits. In its Outline of Submissions (at para 35), the
(c) defined the distribution rate as the proportion
of imputation credits generated by the benchmark efficient entity that is
distributed
to investors;
(d) defined the utilisation rate as the value to investors in the market per
dollar of imputation credits distributed, which reflects
the extent to which
investors can utilise the imputation credits they receive to reduce their tax or
obtain a refund ...
(e) estimated the distribution rate using the “cumulative payout ratio
approach”, which uses data from the ATO on the
accounts used by companies
to track their stocks of imputation credits (franking account balances);
(f) estimated the utilisation rate by giving varying degrees of weight to the
different available estimation methods identified in
the ROR Guidelines.
estimating the utilisation rate the AER gave significant weight to equity
ownership information, less weight to taxation statistics
and lesser weight to
market value studies (such as dividend drop-off studies).
Grounds of review
argues that the AER made multiple errors of fact, was unreasonable, or made an
incorrect exercise of its discretion in determining
that the appropriate value
for gamma is 0.4. These commence at paragraph 37 of its Amended Application for
leave, and run for several
pages. Since they are, in many cases duplicative,
interrelated, and overlapping, it is not helpful for the Tribunal to reproduce
them verbatim, but rather to summarize them in an order which facilitates a
logical approach to analysis.
SAPN contends that the AER erred in misconstruing the correct interpretation of
“value of imputation credits” through
focusing on utilisation rather
than implied market value.
this misconstruction led the AER to incorrectly give greater weight to
utilisation measures of imputation credit other than
market based studies and
particularly dividend drop-off studies.
SAPN contends that the AER erred in not recognising that investors would incur
personal costs in extracting value from receipt
of imputation credits which
would reduce the value ascribed to them.
in calculating the value of imputation credits from equity ownership and
taxation information, the AER used inappropriate
the AER in interpreting equity ownership and taxation figures failed to
recognise that these are maximum possible values.
the AER did not accord sufficient weight to the dividend drop-off study of SFG
Consulting (‘
’) due to misconceptions about the merits and
reliability of drop-off studies.
Tribunal notes that in relation to the concept of the “value of imputation
credits” referred to in the first of the
issues listed above, different
theoretical models, all of which are simplifications of reality, with different
strengths and weaknesses,
and with different degrees of support among experts,
may suggest differing approaches. Judgement about the weight to be given to
alternative approaches would then be required, with resulting consequences for
judgements about the subsequent issues.
Consistency of approach with the PTRM framework
this section, the Tribunal addresses the first of SAPN’s challenges
– that the AER erred in misconstruing the correct
interpretation of
“value of imputation credits” through focusing on utilisation rather
than implied market value.
Fundamental
to the dispute over gamma is the correct interpretation of the word
“value” in the NER which relates to one
of the two components of
gamma. It is accepted by all parties, and defined in the NER (cl 6.5.3) that
gamma is the product of two
components. Gamma is the value of franking credits
generated by the company tax paid by the entity. In turn gamma is defined as
the product of the “F” (the distribution rate) and
“θ” (theta – variously described as the utilisation
or the market value (price) of distributed credits).
AER places particular emphasis on the statement in cl 6.5.3 of the NER that the
estimated cost of corporate income tax is to be
“determined in accordance
with the post-tax revenue model”. That model (abbreviated as PTRM) is
based on the derivation
by Professor Officer of equivalence relationships
between various formulations of the calculation of the NPV of future cash flows
under an imputation tax system. In particular, Officer showed that the NPV=0
criterion could be described in a number of different
ways, each involving
different future cash flow concepts (with differences arising from different
treatment of taxation) and correspondingly
consistent interpretations of a
discount rate (WACC). Officer’s approach assumed a 100% distribution
rate, which has been
generalised in the common approach adopted by the AER and
regulated entities of defining gamma as the product of “F”
“θ” as described above. Consequently, debate over the value of
gamma involves debate over the values of both
“θ”, with the latter being the more contentious and fundamental
to the interpretation of the
PTRM model. Dispute over the value of
“F” relates more to the choice of empirical data for its estimation
rather than
fundamental theoretical issues.
observed (at page 4 of the aforementioned article) that:
A proportion (γ) of the tax collected from the
company will be rebated against personal tax and, therefore, is not really
tax but rather is a collection of personal tax at the company level.
Therefore, if we wish to define the effective company tax collection,
reduce T by the proportion γ. ...
Thus γ is the proportion of tax collected from the company which gives
rise to the tax credit associated with a franked dividend.
This franking credit
can be utilized as tax credit against the personal tax liabilities of the
shareholder. γ can be interpreted
as the value of a dollar of tax credit
to the shareholder.
also observed (p 4, fn 5) that:
Where there is a market for tax credits one could use
the market price to estimate the value of γ for the marginal shareholder.
i.e. the shareholder who implicitly sets the price of the shares and the price
of γ and the company’s cost of capital
at the margin, but where there
is only a covert market, estimates can only be made through dividend drop-off
are (at least) two possible interpretations of these comments, as has been
pointed out in submissions and expert evidence.
First, the derivation by
Officer places emphasis on gamma as the amount of tax credits which are utilised
to reduce personal tax
liabilities, and this is the interpretation used by the
AER. It also leads to an interpretation of “effective” company
payments as being T(1 – γ) where T is the amount of tax collected at
the company level. Secondly, Officer asserts
that the market value of gamma
will be set by the marginal investor, and that this can only be indirectly
estimated by dividend drop-off
rates. This, or at least the emphasis on
drop-off studies, is the interpretation focused upon by SAPN and other
Tribunal notes that the AER, in its reasoning in the ROR Guideline quoted
earlier, did not interpret the drop-off evidence as
relating to a marginal
investor, but rather to some average investor prevailing at that specific time.
The Tribunal also notes that
Officer’s interpretation of the role of a
“marginal investor” in price determination is one commonly found in
literature, as also is the notion of an average investor.
is also worth noting the emphasis given by Officer to the “marginal
shareholder” in the determination of share prices
and the implicit price
of γ. This underscores, and potentially calls into question, a
commonly-heard assertion which is also
made by SAPN. The marginal investor is
not the same as the average investor. The proportion of tax credits used in
aggregate (ie
the average utilisation) provides no information about the value
of tax credits to the marginal investor. Hence, contrary to the
advanced, the usage of tax credits is not an upper bound on the market value of
tax credits – if that is set by some
“marginal investor”.
Alternatively, if the market value is set by some “average”
investor, an estimate for
the average investor of the tax payment consequences
of imputation credits distributed has relevance. As argued by SAPN, the value
estimated in this way may be an upper bound due to a number of value-reducing
factors. This is considered later.
raises a fundamental consideration in the approach to the determination of a
market value for imputation credits and implications
for the cost of capital.
Officer’s approach, and consequent adoption of the “vanilla
WACC” approach in the PTRM
does not imply anything about the precise value
of γ nor how it is determined. Officer does argue that the required return
on equity will be lower than would otherwise be the case (in the absence of
imputation) by the value of franking credits (γ)
received with dividends.
And while he uses an “imputation adjusted CAPM” to illustrate, the
determination of the value
of γ involved in that is not specified.
noted above, there are, at least, two alternative theoretical approaches to
considering the determination of γ. One relies
on an average investor
perspective, the other on a marginal investor. On this matter, the AER (Final
Decision, Attachment 4, p 60)
quotes from a recent academic paper (A. Ainsworth,
G. Partington and G. Warren, Do Franking Credits Matter? Exploring the Financial
Implications of Dividend Imputation, May 2015):
Indeed, whether prices are set by a marginal
investor, or by aggregation across investors, is an open question
average investor perspective is reflected in versions of the CAPM which allow
for the imputation system such as those developed
by P. Monkhouse and by
Professors M. Lally and T. van Zijl, and considered by the AER. These
models give rise to a utilisation rate
which “in equilibrium is equal to
the weighted average, by wealth and risk aversion, of the individual utilisation
investors in the market” (Final Decision Attachment 4, p 52). In
those models, this utilisation rate is also the value of
distributed imputation
credits in the sense that the equilibrium required rate of return on equity
(ignoring the franking credit
component received) is reduced by that figure.
For example, if an investor required a 10% return on a stock offering returns in
a form involving no receipt of imputation credits, then if an otherwise
equivalent stock provided an imputation credit yield of 3%
which was valued at
50% of face value, the required return ignoring imputation credits would be
8.5%. This would imply that in the
PTRM where a vanilla WACC is used and the
effect of imputation incorporated into the required tax revenue component of
cash flows,
the utilisation rate is an appropriate estimate of theta (as an
input into gamma) which can be used.
challenges the validity of use of these tax adjusted CAPM models, and the
implication that the utilisation rate (estimated using
either shareholder
nationality or taxation statistics) can be used to estimate gamma. The
principal critique is one of the logical
consistency of using a
“domestic” CAPM model when an international perspective is required.
Interpreting utilisation
as reflecting the proportion of domestic investors, for
whom imputation credits are valuable, implies that the remaining investors
foreigners. But, in that case, it is argued, the CAPM market portfolio should
be the world portfolio, and those foreigner investors
would have a wealth many
multiples of the amount they have invested in the local market (and of domestic
investors). In the limit,
the role of domestic investors in domestic stock
valuation and implied value of imputation credits would be zero. The AER (Final
Report, Attachment 4 p 64) considers this critique and on the advice of its
expert (Associate Professor J. Handley) rejects it.
Underpinning that rejection
is the argument that the CAPM assumes only that there is specified group of
investors who hold the specified
set (market) of assets being considered. The
equilibrium individual asset prices and expected returns are derived by
reference to
their systematic risk relative to that specified market. In that
framework, which takes as given the wealth invested by foreigners
domestic market, the weights implied in the determination of gamma would reflect
relative wealth shares of the domestic market,
not total wealth.
a framework may, or may not be reasonable, but there is no one generally
accepted model for dealing with asset pricing in a domestic
market where
foreigners subject to different tax considerations participate. As the AER
notes (p 64), an “international”
CAPM (of which there are a number
of variants) could be adopted but, as well as not being advocated by SAPN, this
would require fundamental
re-estimation of betas and cost of equity, as well as
valuation of imputation credits.
this matter, the Tribunal recognises the fact that models are, at best,
simplifications of and approximations to reality. There
has been, and likely
always will be, debate over how to assess the relative merits of alternative
models. One perspective is that
models should be evaluated by explanatory
performance, rather than by the reality of their assumptions. On this
criterion, the possible
lack of realism of the Monkhouse and Lally and van Zijl
models, argued by SFG (Estimating Gamma for Regulatory Purposes, February
for SAPN, is not necessarily a reason for rejecting them, provided that their
predictions are not rejected empirically. Unfortunately,
in terms of resolving
the debate over these matters, the relevant empirical evidence is quite
alternative approach to considering the valuation of imputation credits is based
on assuming that it is the “marginal investor”
who determines
security prices and thus sets the value of imputation credits impounded into
that price. As in standard price theory,
investors may have different
valuations for a stock (reflecting different information or personal
considerations including tax),
and specific amounts they demand at various
market prices. Limits to arbitrage, risk, wealth constraints, or other factors
to their demands not being infinitely elastic at some price.
Aggregated, these investor demands generate a downward sloping total
curve for the stock. The market clearing price will be that at which the
marginal investor’s valuation equals that
price, with some infra-marginal
investors placing a valuation on their holding above that price. In theory, at
least, the marginal
investor is either a domestic investor for whom theta = 1 or
a foreign investor for whom theta = 0. In practice, determination of
prices (from which implied market value estimates of imputation credit value
might be derived) is more complex, reflecting
market and individual
characteristics (including limits to arbitrage).
is no guarantee (nor reason to necessarily expect) that the marginal,
price-setting investor will be the same type of investor
at all points in time.
For example, institutional features of the stock market mean that returns only
have an explicit dividend
(and franking credit) component (rather than
comprising only capital gains or losses) if stocks are held on the date of
Moreover, the franking component of dividends can only be useable if
holdings satisfy the 45-day holding requirement around the ex-div
date. There
are also constraints on franking credit usage if the stock holding is hedged
against price risk (such as by use of derivatives).
marginal investor perspective has several implications for assessing dividend
drop-off studies, which are based on prices being
determined by arbitrage by
marginal investors (or by average investors active in the market at that time).
First, if drop-off studies
are estimating valuation of a marginal investor, the
imputation credit usage figure, being an average, is not a relevant upper bound
for that valuation. It may be so, although not necessarily, for the alternative
approach where valuation is based on the average
investor. Secondly, for
reliable information to be extracted from drop-off studies, constancy of the
marginal investor pre and post
the dividend ex-date is required. Otherwise the
drop-off figures may reflect nothing more than a short-term change in the
composition
of investors, and not information about the role of imputation
credits in determining the required return of longer-term investors.
conclusion, the Tribunal is of the view, reflected in the diversity of expert
opinion, that there is no generally accepted theoretical
model for explaining
the valuation of imputation credits. There is broad agreement across experts
that the existence of the imputation
system lowers, to some degree, the cost of
equity capital to Australian, domestically operating, companies, relative to a
tax system. That is, required returns ignoring imputation credits (ie
expected cash dividends plus capital gains) will be lower
if imputation credits
are expected to be attached to cash dividends.
the framework of the PTRM and “vanilla WACC” requirement of the NER,
this translates into a reduction in the revenue
allowance for corporate tax
payments. Within the Officer framework underpinning that approach, that revenue
reduction could be interpreted
as reflecting that some part of company tax
payments is a pre-payment (withholding) of personal taxes. Alternatively, the
interpretation
could be that the revenue reduction is the value accorded by the
market to that pre-payment of personal taxes and reflected in the
(non-vanilla)
cost of equity capital. Under the “average investor” approach these
should, in theory, coincide. Under
the marginal investor approach, the
relationship is indeterminate – unless specific assumptions about the
identity (and constancy)
of the marginal investor are made.
Unfortunately,
the available empirical evidence is inadequate to enable confident
discrimination between these alternative perspectives.
There are a range of
studies, reviewed in the AER’s Final Decision, using market prices which
attempt to estimate the extent
to which imputation credits are capitalised into
stock prices and thus their market valuation. There are a range of results, and
experts are divided on the merits of the various approaches and techniques.
Consequently,
the Tribunal is of the view that the AER did not err, nor was unreasonable, in
giving most weight to the “utilisation”
approach. It considered the
range of alternative approaches, recognised the diversity of views of experts on
their merits (both
theoretical and empirical), and made a judgement call. In
doing so, it demonstrated responsiveness to the empirical evidence in
its estimate of gamma from 0.5 as proposed in its ROR Guidelines to a value of
0.4. The Tribunal recognises that this decision
is the converse of that made by
a differently constituted Tribunal in the
case. The reason for
this difference is twofold. First, submissions in this hearing gave greater
attention to the theoretical underpinnings
of the PTRM and “vanilla
WACC” framework. Secondly, and as discussed immediately below, this
Tribunal is of the view
that the dividend drop-off evidence should be viewed in
the context of the theoretical model underpinning it, and that there are
significant uncertainties associated with extracting reliable evidence about
tax-related parameters (such as gamma) from such studies.
Dividend drop-off evidence
Tribunal now considers the second and sixth issues noted above which both assert
that the AER should have given more (or complete)
weight to evidence from
dividend drop-off studies (and in particular the SFG study).
(and other DNSPs in other cases) argue that, in estimating the value of
distributed imputation credits, most if not complete
weight should be given to
results from dividend drop-off studies. In particular, it is argued that the
primary piece of evidence
should be the results from a 2013 study by SFG
commissioned by the Energy Networks Association. The latest version of this
updates an earlier 2011 study by SFG which had been undertaken in response
to directions from the Tribunal. In contrast the AER
argues that evidence from
this type of approach should be given least weight.
2011 study concluded that “the appropriate estimate of theta from the
dividend drop-off analysis that we have performed
is 0.35 and that this estimate
is paired with an estimate of the value of cash dividends in the range of 0.85
to 0.90.” The
2013 study which uses data from 2001 to October 2012
generates similar results.
Tribunal notes that the SFG study is very clear about the data used and
econometric techniques employed. Different specifications
(reflecting
statistical considerations required to achieve unbiased, efficient estimates) of
the basic relationship estimated generate
similar results. That basic
relationship links the fall in stock price on the ex-dividend date (the
drop-off) to the amount of the
cash dividend and the amount of the franking
(imputation) credit. Because the study includes dividend events which may
involve no,
partial, or full franking, it is able to estimate the sensitivity of
the drop-off to both the size of dividend and the size of the
franking credit in
a regression relationship.
the Tribunal also notes that interpreting the drop-off sensitivity as evidence
such as the “value” of a
franking credit (gamma) requires a number of further, quite strong, assumptions.
In its Final
Decision (Attachment 4, Section A.14) the AER gave explicit
attention to issues involved in estimation of gamma from dividend drop-off
studies. It considered the view of a number of experts including SFG (Professor
S. Gray), Associate Professor J. Handley, Associate
Professor M. Lally,
Professor M. McKenzie and Associate Professor G. Partington, and examined a
range of academic studies.
number of issues regarding reliability of dividend drop-off studies were
considered by the AER, but only one is substantive in this
context, given the
Tribunal’s view that the methodology and approach of the SFG study is
generally acceptable (or “state
of the art” as claimed by the
DNSPs). The Tribunal recognises that some researchers may prefer use of
alternative approaches
or choices of specific data in analysing drop-off rates,
but offers no comment on those empirical matters. That is the question
whether the sensitivities of the drop-off rate to dividend characteristics as
estimated in such a study can be reliably interpreted
as reflecting specific
tax-related factors (such as the value of gamma). On this there is marked
disagreement between the experts,
with SFG (Professor S. Gray) asserting that
the value of imputation credits can be reliably inferred, and the others
referred to
above, advancing a range of reasons in support of an opposing
its Final Decision (Attachment 4, p 48) the AER notes that:
There is no market for imputation credits and therefore
there is no directly observable market price. ...
The value of imputation credits as estimated through a dividend drop off
is not necessarily a correct post company
tax value before personal taxes and personal transaction costs (particularly
demonstrated
where the study estimates a value for cash dividends materially
below their face value as the SFG study does)
coming to this conclusion, the AER liberally quotes criticisms of dividend
drop-off studies from experts Associate Professor J.
Handley, Associate
Professor M. Lally, Professor M. McKenzie and Associate Professor G.
Partington, and other authors. There are
a range of criticisms, with the most
significant being that of whether dividend drop-off information can provide
information about
tax parameters, such as the value of imputation credits. In
this regard the AER quotes from a paper by K. Siau, S. Sault and G.
(2013) which references a range of other well-known published studies which have
identified the problem that drop-off rates
can reflect a range of other
influences other than taxation:
A key methodological issue is that price movements
around ex-dividend events encapsulate not only the tax differential effect, but
may also reflect the presence of traders seeking to arbitrage dividends and
noise associated with trading activity around ex-dividend
dates. Drop-off
ratios can be distorted by the need to compensate traders for transaction costs
(Eades, Hess, and Kim ,1984); Lakonishok
and Vermaelen, 1986; Karpoff and
Walkling, 1988, 1990; Bali and Francis, 2011); or the risk involved (Fedenia and
Grammatikos, 1993;
Grammatikos, 1989; Heath and Jarrow, 1988; Michaely and Vila,
1995). Transaction costs may be substantial, and can drive the drop-off
below one (Kalay 1982, 1984; Boyd and Jagannathan, 1994). Market microstructure
effects may also complicate estimation of
market value, as discrete tick sizes
can bias drop-off ratios downwards (Dubofsky, 1992; Bali and Hite, 1998).
A further key methodological issue is the difficulty in attributing the
observed drop-off value between cash dividends and imputation
Tribunal also notes that the typical argument used to motivate use of drop-off
studies is one of arbitrage based on differences
between the cum-div price (and
entitlement to dividend) and the ex-div price (with no entitlement to dividend).
The “marginal
investor(s)” would, in the absence of substantive
transactions costs and risk, adopt a trading strategy to capitalise upon
consequences. This behaviour would cause the price drop-off to reflect
characteristics of the tax code, such as differences
in capital gains tax rates
and dividend tax rates, possibly allowing inferences to be made about the tax
arrangements facing the
marginal investor(s). But as noted above, evidence of
the price drop-off differing systematically from the dividend amount could
reflect a number of other factors in addition to, or other than, tax
implications. These also include the “marginal investor(s)”
differing tax considerations) being different on the cum-div and ex-div dates,
or different to the marginal investor throughout
the rest of the year.
Tribunal also notes that such a rationale for drop-off studies appears to make
attempting to estimate the market value of franking
credits from such a study
highly problematic. The reason is that the operation of the 45-day rule impacts
upon the consequences
of such trading strategies. For example, purchase of a
stock cum-div and sale on the ex-div day (as implied by an arbitrage argument
where the marginal investor anticipates a sufficiently low drop-off) would
generally void the ability of the investor to use franking
credits attached to
the dividend due to the 45-day rule. This type of arbitrage strategy would thus
tend to imply an equilibrium
expected price drop-off (where no arbitrage gains
result) equal to the cash value of the dividend, regardless of how much
credits were valued by longer-term investors. The situation is
obviously more complex than this since equilibrium requires analysis
gain/loss tax consequences from trading strategies involving sales by existing
holders or short sales and associated stock
borrowing costs – including
requirements to compensate stock lenders for the equivalent of any franked
dividends received.
Tribunal is thus of the view that while dividend drop-off studies may convey
some information about tax parameters and valuation
of their consequences for
the set(s) of investors determining stock prices around the ex-div date, there
are too many other confounding
factors to place sole, or even, major weight on
such studies for the estimation of the value of franking credits in the context
AER makes a number of other criticisms of drop-off studies. A general one is
that there have been a range of results, sometimes
implausible, from different
drop-off studies. The Tribunal accepts those observations as a matter of fact,
but does not regard them
as a valid reason to reject the statistical results of
a particular study (such as that by SFG). However, as mentioned above, the
fundamental issue is whether valid tax related valuation parameters can be
reliably inferred from such statistical results. Because
of the weight of
expert evidence questioning that such inferences can be reliably drawn, and the
AER reliance on that evidence in
forming a judgement, the Tribunal does not
believe it needs to address those other criticisms. The uncertainty associated
with drawing
conclusions about the value of imputation credits from any existing
drop-off study (no matter how well specified and conducted) was
sufficient for
the AER to make a judgement to accord limited weight to this type of evidence.
Consequently, the Tribunal does not
agree that the AER erred or was unreasonable
in placing less weight on dividend drop-off studies in the estimation of the
The role of personal costs
this section the Tribunal considers SAPN’s third and fifth contentions.
SAPN argues that (a) there are a range of personal
costs faced by investors in
obtaining “value” from imputation credits which would reduce the
value below that implied
by their face value, and (b) this would reduce the
market valuation of imputation credits relative to estimates based on the
shareholder
nationality or taxation statistics. Thus, the required return on
equity would be higher (gamma would be lower) than implied by using
value based on the shareholder nationality or taxation statistics
argued that the delays investors experience
in receiving tax offsets or rebates
from using franking credits reduces their value relative to face value. A
second one is the
consequences of the 45-day rule, precluding investors from
using tax credits unless they have held the stock unhedged for that length
time around the ex-div date. Some Australian investors may have violated this
rule and thus the value obtained, in terms of tax
reduction or rebate, from
receipt of franking credits may be less than the face value received. The third
argument is that investors
who aim to maximise imputation credit receipts will
suffer from reduced portfolio diversification which imposes a cost, in the form
of increased risk, upon them.
can be little doubt that the investor-level (or personal) costs involved in
making and managing investments will affect the
price they are willing to pay
for (or sell) an asset. For some investors, certain of those costs might be
high and for others inconsequential.
How they impact upon market prices, and
the valuation of certain asset characteristics such as imputation credit yield,
is not something
well determined by theory. In practice, market prices might
incorporate the personal costs of a marginal investor for whom those
trivial (or otherwise), or reflect some average of such costs across investors.
Moreover, the effects of such costs on
asset demand will be intermingled with a
range of other asset price determinants such as differential views on
fundamental values
and liquidity needs. There would thus, it seems, need to be
a very strong case to identify some such general investor costs and
attribute to
them some systematic effect on asset prices (and valuation of imputation
credits). This is particularly so when the
argument advanced is that these
factors imply that predictions drawn from a theoretical model (in this case a
tax-adjusted CAPM implying
a price-setting role for some “average
investor”) which ignores such factors, will be biased in a particular
Such factors could, for example, already be reflected in the
composition of investors such that this group comprises those to whom
are of minor significance. It is not clear to the Tribunal that such a case has
been substantiated.
contends that the delay in accessing tax benefits from receipt of imputation
credits will reduce their present value to below
face value. That may be the
case for some investors, but would appear to imply logically that such investors
will also discount
the tax costs associated with any taxes yet to be paid on
dividends. The net effect is unclear, and introduces the confounding effect
investor discounting of future tax liabilities from actual (or as yet
unrealised) capital gains or losses which are otherwise
ignored. More
generally, it is not obvious that a fund manager who uses imputation credits to
offset other future known or expected
tax liabilities on their portfolio would
find merit in applying such discounting. As a practical matter, the relatively
lags and currently low discount rate which would likely be applied
suggest that this effect is likely to be small. Because there
may well be
investors important to price determination who do not discount such tax-benefit
delay consequences, the Tribunal is not
convinced of the materiality of this
contends that the 45-day rule will reduce the ability of domestic investors to
utilise all imputation credits received. Evidence
presented to the Tribunal
point is hard to judge.
More generally, while this effect may be relevant, its
effect on the valuation of imputation credits is far from clear. It is,
example, an institutional factor which is outside the formal structure of models
used for analysis, such that the consequences
with regard to results of such
models which ignore it in their determination of asset prices is unclear. As
noted earlier, the Tribunal
also questions whether the existence of the 45-day
rule (which voids imputation credits from short-term trading around the ex-div
date) impedes the ability of dividend drop-off studies to inform on the value of
imputation credits.
contends that domestic investors who structure their portfolios to acquire
imputation credits will incur costs due to loss of
diversification benefits, and
that this will reduce the implicit price they are willing to pay for imputation
credits to something
below face value. Given that there is a well-documented
“home-bias” in investor portfolios (found internationally generally
regardless of tax systems), implying incomplete diversification benefits, the
extent to which this is an additional factor of significant
materiality is
Tribunal is of the view that while some investors do experience investor level
(personal) costs in dealing in equities, these
can vary substantially across
investor groups. It is thus not clear what effect such costs will have on
equity market prices or
on the need to adjust estimates for implied values of
franking credits drawn from shareholder distribution or tax statistics.
Estimates using shareholder nationality, company type, and
tax statistics
contention that the AER erred in adopting a wrong conception of
“value” of imputation credits and consequently
placing more weight
on shareholder and tax statistics then on dividend drop-off results for
estimation purposes has been dealt with
earlier. The Tribunal determined that
there was no error involved.
leaves as a matter for further contention the appropriate statistics to be used
which forms the basis of the fourth contention
of SAPN. SAPN contend that the
AER erred in three ways in data choices in estimating gamma. However, because
the AER only gave
a range of figures for each of the inputs to the gamma
calculation and not explicit figures used in reaching its final estimate of
gamma, the issue before the Tribunal is whether the net result of its decision
based on these ranges for inputs is unreasonable or
in error. To assess that,
however, it is necessary to determine whether the ranges adopted were
reasonable.
following Table (extracted from Table 1 of SAPN’s Outline of Submissions)
provides a concise summary of the AER analysis
and decisions which are points of
contention.
ROR Guideline
Final decisions
Reason for change
Distribution rate
0.7 for all equity
0.77 for listed equity
AER takes into account the distribution rate for all equity and listed equity in
the Final Decision.
Theta estimate from equity ownership data
0.56-0.68 for all equity
0.38-0.55 for listed equity
Further analysis by the AER demonstrated that its previous estimate of 0.7-0.8
was too high.
Theta estimate from tax statistics
Further analysis by the AER demonstrated that the best estimate is
The distribution rate
the AER considered the possibility of a different value for the Distribution
Rate (F) to the figure of 0.7 based on all equity,
which was adopted in the ROR
Guideline. An alternative figure of 0.77 was considered based on listed equity
only. This raises the
question of whether the distribution rate of the
hypothetical benchmark efficient entity (‘
’) is better
proxied by the average of any company or listed companies only. SAPN asserts
that by having regard to the distribution
rate of listed companies the AER was
in error. The principal reason advanced is that the BEE is assumed to have only
domestic earnings,
whereas many large listed companies have foreign earnings
which do not generate imputation credits. Then, if the dividend payout
(dividends/earnings) is the same as for the BEE, the distribution rate of
imputation credits (credits distributed/credits generated)
will be higher. That
argument, does not, however, allow for the possibility that such companies with
foreign earnings have a lower
dividend payout ratio.
generally, dividend payout ratios and distribution rates can be expected to vary
between companies based on ownership characteristics
and need/preferences for
internally generated capital. Unlisted companies vary markedly. At one extreme
there are small companies
owned by individuals on high marginal tax rates who
may prefer earnings retention to generate concessionally-taxed long-term capital
gains or to defer the additional tax which would need to be paid on franked
dividends. At the other extreme, large foreign-owned
Australian registered
companies may also prefer retention and reinvestment of earnings rather than
distribution of dividends and
attached franking credits which would be
conclusion the Tribunal reaches is that there is no compelling reason which has
been advanced to believe that the “average”
unlisted company is any
better or worse than the “average” listed company as a proxy for the
BEE. Consequently the Tribunal
does not believe that the AER made an error or
was unreasonable or incorrectly exercised its discretion in considering
of distribution rates for listed entities.
Equity ownership data
AER placed most reliance on estimates of the domestic ownership rate for
estimating theta. This is consistent with its conceptual
interpretation of the
role of gamma in the PTRM and the NER as considered earlier in these reasons,
and with which this Tribunal
does not find error.
contends that the AER then erred in two regards in use of ownership statistics.
First, it argues that the AER did not take account
of the fact that the domestic
ownership percentage is at best an upper bound on the value of theta because of
the inability of some
investors to use imputation credits. As this Tribunal has
noted previously, that argument is incorrect if it is believed that stock
(and thus imputation credit value) are determined by some marginal investor.
Even if the average investor perspective is
taken, there may be other relevant
factors, not adequately captured in theoretical models, which preclude an
interpretation as an
upper bound.
SAPN contends that the actual equity ownership figures used by the AER are
essentially not fit for purpose. The principal
argument advanced here is that
the AER uses data since 2000 in determining the potential range of relevant
values for equity ownership.
Instead, SAPN argues, it should be the current
rate of domestic equity ownership which should be used. It points to the
own analysis (Final Decision, Attachment 4, p 96, Figure 4-3)
showing that the domestic ownership share at the end of 2014 was 0.6
equity and 0.45 for listed equity. These were both marginally below the
midpoint of the ranges of 0.56-0.68 and 0.38-0.55
respectively in post-2000 data
considered by the AER.
AER’s counterargument is that (a) there is considerable temporal
variability in ownership shares; (b) there is a degree
of uncertainty about the
precision of available information; and (c) the regulatory control period spans
five years such that it
is necessary to predict ownership rates over the whole
of that period (AER’s Outline of Submissions, para 96). The Tribunal
unable to see the validity of the last point in the context of estimating the
value of imputation credits as at the start of the
regulatory period. It
relates to an interpretation of theta as purely a utilisation rate over a
five-year period. While the Tribunal
recognises the need for analysis of
historical data to reduce uncertainty surrounding current figures, it would
expect that sound
reasons would be provided for using figures significantly
different from the current value given that this is close to the historical
average. As discussed below, the implied value for theta used by the AER in
adjusting the MRP is 0.6 which is not inconsistent with
the 2014 domestic
ownership share of total equity.
also asserts (Outline of Submissions, para 127) that the listed company,
domestic equity ownership, figure will provide a better
proxy (than the total
figure which includes unlisted companies) for that applicable to a BEE. This
argument appears at variance
with SAPN’s argument in the context of
distribution rates (discussed above) that unlisted equity would provide a better
than listed equity for the BEE. The Tribunal is however willing to accept
that there might be different proxies better suited to
estimation of different
characteristics of the hypothetical BEE. Nevertheless, the Tribunal has not
been presented with convincing
evidence that the listed equity data should not
have been considered by the AER.
Tribunal thus does not find that the AER erred or that its decision was
unreasonable in considering historical data on domestic
equity ownership shares
for both listed and all companies. The issue of whether it was unreasonable in
forming a judgement about
gamma, based on weighing a range of evidence,
including the implied choice of values from the ranges examined, is considered
The use of taxation statistics
contends that the AER erred, or made an incorrect exercise of discretion and was
unreasonable in its use of taxation statistics
by failing to recognise that the
credit redemption rate of 0.45 from such statistics (which number is not in
dispute) (a) did not
indicate the value of imputation credits to investors and
(b) and was an upper bound on the value of theta.
AER gave less weight to the taxation statistics than to equity ownership
information (and more weight than to market value (dividend
drop-off studies).
It argued for giving greater weight to equity ownership data on the grounds of
concerns about the reliability
of the tax statistics.
Tribunal was presented with a range of information which indicates that there is
a considerable degree of uncertainty about the
reliability of the tax statistics
regarding the redemption rate of imputation credits. That, of itself, implies
that the redemption
rate figure from tax statistics is not an upper bound for
the utilisation rate, but rather a noisy estimate. Whether, ignoring that
it would be an upper bound for the market valuation of distributed credits has
been considered earlier. As explained there,
the answer to that question
depends upon the unsettled issue, on which experts disagree, of how stock market
prices are determined.
In particular, if a marginal price-setting investor
perspective is taken, the average utilisation rate implies nothing about
by a marginal investor. If an average investor perspective is taken,
then the figure is potentially more relevant to being a noisy
upper bound on
Tribunal does note, however, that the arguments advance in the context of the
shareholder-nationality approach for a market value
less than implied by those
statistics do not all apply in this case. In particular, the argument relating
to the 45-day rule would
be irrelevant, since any effect of that would already
be reflected in the utilisation rate being less than 100%.
argument that the redemption rate does not reflect the value of imputation
credits to investors has also been considered earlier.
The Tribunal has noted
that experts are divided on this issue, and has found no reason to accept that
the interpretation by the
AER is incorrect.
the face of significant uncertainty, the approach by the AER of considering a
range of approaches to estimating gamma and applying
different weights to those
approaches is, the Tribunal believes, appropriate. It is clear that some
experts would apply different
weights to the alternative types of evidence, and
that some support the AER’s relative ranking while others disagree. In
particular,
some would accord much higher weight to results of dividend drop-off
studies. The Tribunal has noted the arguments about the problems
of deriving
reliable tax-related parameters such as investor valuation of imputation credits
from drop-off parameters, and is of
the view that the AER did not err in forming
the judgement it did regarding weight to give to different forms of
Tribunal also feels it worth commenting on the interrelation between the value
of gamma and the market risk premium (‘
’) estimate, since
this was raised in submissions. Specifically, the AER noted that in deriving a
value for the MRP based on
historical data from both pre and post imputation
periods, an adjustment incorporating gamma is required. It appears, from
submitted, that in doing so the AER has implicitly adopted a higher
gamma for that adjustment than used explicitly in the matters
considered here.
Doing so means that the MRP and allowed rate of return on equity is higher than
would be the case if a lower value
was used. The AER states (Final Decision,
Attachment 3, p 398) that “[o]ur adjustment is based on investors valuing
distributed
franking credits at 60 per cent of their face value”.
the risk of repetition of earlier remarks, but to elaborate, this arises because
the PTRM is a post-company tax model in which
company tax payments are measured
net of the implied value of personal tax pre-payments resulting from
distribution of imputation
credits. The “vanilla WACC” rate of
return on equity component is before investor tax consequences arising from, or
costs incurred in, deriving that return. It is the rate of return the company
would need to provide in the form of capital gains
and cash dividends to meet
shareholder requirements assuming that no imputation credits were distributed.
Consequently, the allowed
rate of return in the revenue determination is
increased, relative to that (capital gains and cash dividends return) observed
the market, by the value of imputation credits distributed. In adjusting
historical data on the MRP to reflect the introduction
of imputation in 1987,
the MRP data post that date is increased by an assumed value of imputation
credits received by investors.
This is offset (to some degree) by the
subtraction of the value of distributed imputation credits from the allowed
revenues for
meeting tax obligations. Thus, a lower assumed valuation of gamma
would have two partially offsetting effects on the allowed revenue.
The rate of
return on capital component would be reduced (since there would be a smaller
upward adjustment of the rate of return)
while the tax component would be
increased (due to reduced deduction of a lower value of distributed
theory, if not in practice, there are circumstances where these effects could be
exactly offsetting. One could be where the company
was fully equity financed,
had a CAPM beta of unity, distributed all cash flows, and the required return
involved grossing up the
observed market returns and MRP under imputation by a
gamma factor which was used also in determining the tax revenues. In that
it would appear that the actual value of gamma might be irrelevant to the
allowed revenue determination – it would simply
affect the allocation of
revenue between the rate of return and tax components. In practice, the effects
are less clear due to complications
such as (a) estimation of a market rate of
return using both historical pre-imputation and post-imputation observations;
code features such as differences in accounting and tax treatment of
depreciation; (c) use of debt financing; and (d) equity betas
from unity.
the current context, the possible use of a higher theta value in adjusting the
historical MRP than in determining the tax revenue
allowance (although the AER
does not provide information on the precise value used for this latter figure)
could involve some inconsistency
which would work in favour of SAPN.
Alternatively, if a theta value of 0.6 was also applied in the determination of
gamma, a result
for gamma of 0.4 suggests use of a distribution rate of slightly
below 0.7. That would make redundant the debate over whether AER’s
consideration of the distribution rate of 0.77 of listed companies is preferable
to a consideration of all companies (with a distribution
rate of 0.7).
Tribunal simply notes that (a) consistency in the adjustment of the MRP for the
value of franking credits distributed (theta)
and in the value assumed for
determining the net corporate tax revenue component is desirable; and (b)
assumption of a higher or
lower value for theta (and thus, ceteris paribus)
gamma will have partially offsetting effects on the rate of return and taxation
components of allowable cash flows.
grounds of review regarding the value of gamma are rejected.
Return on debt
issue regarding the return on debt is the choice of transition arrangements
between the previously used approach for determining
the cost of debt of a
benchmark efficient DNSP and a new approach to be fully implemented by the end
of a 10-year transition process.
The previous approach is referred to as an
“on-the-day” approach in which the cost of debt for each year of the
period was determined as that prevailing at the start of the
regulatory period. The new approach is referred to as an “historical
trailing average” approach and was facilitated by a change to the NER
described below. In that approach the cost of debt in
each year of the
regulatory period is calculated as the average cost of the debt portfolio of a
benchmark efficient DNSP at the start
of that year, resulting from assuming that
it had raised equal amounts of 10-year maturity debt over the past 10 years. It
vary in each year of the regulatory control period.
is no dispute on the decision to change to the new approach, nor on the benefits
of some form of gradual transition to the new
approach. The issue is purely
the transition of
only one of the two components of the cost of debt, namely the
debt risk premium (‘
’). Both parties are in agreement on
the merits of, and on the form of, a gradual transition arrangement for the
component of the cost of debt.
transition of the risk-free component involves a determination in the first year
of the regulatory period using the previous
“on-the-day” approach
– which takes the rate prevailing in the market at (or just prior to) the
start of the regulatory
control period. In each subsequent year the weight
given to the “on-the-day” figure (ie the rate at the start of the
regulatory control period) in calculating the return on debt for that year would
decline by 10% per year. The risk-free rate (calculated
as an average over some
previously agreed averaging period) just prior to the start of each subsequent
year would be given a weight
of 10% and would remain part of the calculation
with that same weight for 10 years. Thus, the on-the-day rate would have 90%
in the second year and the average rate determined for the start of that
second year would have 10% weight. In the third year, the
on-the-day weight
would decline to 80% with the rate determined for the start of that third year
being given a weight of 10% –
and the rate determined for the start of the
second year remaining in the calculation with a weight of 10%. After 10 years
process full adjustment to the new “historical trailing
average” approach will have occurred.
the Final Decision the AER considered four options for transitioning to the new
approach. The dispute relates to only two of those
options. One of the options
starts with an on-the-day rate for the first regulatory year of the regulatory
control period and then
transitions to the average approach over 10 years in the
manner described above (‘
’). Option 2 was the option
adopted by the AER in the Final Decision and it is the same transition
arrangement as outlined
by the AER in its ROR Guideline – although there
was no (nor needed to be no) separation of borrowing costs there into a
and DRP component made there. The other option uses a hybrid
approach. Under this approach the risk-free rate would transition
like Option
2, however the DRP would transition immediately (‘
Option 3 is the transition approach ultimately advanced by SAPN and rejected by
the AER. SAPN challenges the decision of
the AER that there should also be
gradual transition arrangements for the DRP component.
argues that the correct approach, which it proposed, should instead be an
immediate shift to Option 3.
DRP prevailing at the commencement of the regulatory control period was lower
(at 1.95% per annum) than its 10-year trailing average
which SAPN argued was
2.37% per annum at that date, giving a gap of 0.42% per annum for the first year
of the regulatory control
period (SAPN’s Submissions in Reply, Figure 1).
Because of the past history of the DRP (with much higher values than 1.95
occurring in the wake of the global financial crisis), SAPN argue that the gap
between the Option 2 and Option 3 allowed DRPs would
be significantly higher in
subsequent years of the regulatory control period. That is, the Option 3 DRP
would be more than 42 basis
points above the Option 2 DRP in later years of the
regulatory control period.
is possible to calculate the effect of the AER’s decision, compared to
SAPN’s preferred approach, on the allowed revenue
over the regulatory
period. Future values of the DRP prevailing at the start of each year (and thus
the allowable DRP) are, by definition,
unknown at the start of the regulatory
period. But the effect of a particular outcome on the allowed DRP is the same
Options 2 and 3. The reason is that the DRP prevailing at the start
of a future year enters into the calculation of the allowable
DRP for that year
(and each of the subsequent 10 years) with a weight of 0.1 in both cases. While
the difference in the allowed
DRP between the two options will change
year-by-year due to the “rolling off” of the DRP from 10 years prior
3, the newly included current year DRP will affect the average
calculated by both options equivalently.
argues that in comparing Options 2 and 3 there is a material reduction in
allowed revenue under the AER’s choice of Option
2, which would be in
excess of $40 million over the five-year period. The precise figure would
depend upon what numbers would be
used in Option 3 for past values of the DRP
for a BEE. In oral submission, the AER indicated that their calculations of the
would be $22 million over the five years: Transcript, p 157. There is
debate about how to determine the appropriate numbers, and
while this is
relevant to the AER’s stated reasons for its preference for Option 2, the
appropriate method of determining such
numbers is not a matter before this
asserts that the Final Decision of the AER involved error or errors of fact, an
incorrect exercise of discretion, or was unreasonable.
The errors asserted
relate to each of the AER’s considerations in choosing a transition
method. These were given in the Final
Decision (Attachment 3, pp 170-1) as:
the impact on
promoting efficient financing practices consistent with the principles of
incentive based regulation;
the impact on a
BEE’s opportunity to recover at least its efficient financing costs over
the life of its assets;
matching the
allowed rate of return with efficient financing cashflows over a single
regulatory period, and the potential conflict
between this consideration and
providing a BEE with a reasonable opportunity to recover efficient financing
costs over the life of
its assets;
potential bias in regulatory decision-making that can arise from choosing an
approach that uses historical data after the
results of that historical data is
already known;
avoiding the
practical difficulties in the use of historical data to calculate the allowed
return on debt, particularly during the
global financial crisis.
NER (cl 6.5.2) provide rules for how the return on debt, as one component of the
allowed rate of return, for a DNSP is to be determined
and requires it must
contribute to the allowed rate of return objective (‘
which is defined in NER (cl 6.5.2.(c)) as:
The allowed rate of return objective is that the rate
of return for a Distribution Network Service Provider is to be commensurate
the efficient financing costs of a benchmark efficient entity with a similar
degree of risk as that which applies to the Distribution
Network Service
Provider in respect of the provision of standard control services (the allowed
rate of return objective).
to rule changes in November 2012, the NER required that the return on debt must
be the same figure for each year of the regulatory
control period. In practice
this was implemented through use of the “on-the-day” approach in
which the return on debt
for all years was determined as the prevailing cost of
debt finance at the start of the regulatory control period (using an average
over some agreed, preceding, number of days).
rule changes allowed for the return on debt to be determined to be the same for
each year of a regulatory control period, or to
be different for each year (NER
cl 6.5.2(i)) and, subject to contributing to the ARORO, NER cl 6.5.2(j) allowed
for a methodology
which resulted in the return on debt reflecting:
(a) the return that would be required by
debt investors in a BEE if it raised debt at the time or shortly before the
making of the
distribution determination for the regulatory control period;
(b) the average return that would have been required by debt investors in a BEE
if it raised debt over an historical period prior
to the commencement of a
regulatory year in the regulatory control period; or
(c) some combination of the returns referred to in subparagraphs (a) and
2012 changes included NER cl 6.5.2(k)(4) which required the AER to take into
account any impacts on a BEE that could arise from
a change in the debt
estimation methodology. Clause 6.5.2(k) states that:
In estimating the return on debt under paragraph (h),
regard must be had to the following factors:
(1) the desirability of minimising any
difference between the return on debt and the return on debt of a benchmark
efficient entity
referred to in the allowed rate of return objective;
(2) the interrelationship between the return on equity and the return on
(3) the incentives that the return on debt may provide in relation to capital
expenditure over the regulatory control period, including
as to the timing of
any capital expenditure; and
(4) any impacts (including in relation to the costs of servicing debt across
regulatory control periods) on a benchmark efficient
entity referred to in the
allowed rate of return objective that could arise as a result of changing the
methodology that is used
to estimate the return on debt from one regulatory
control period to the next.
is noteworthy that while these requirements refer to a “benchmark
efficient entity” there is no precise guidance given
on the debt financing
policy assumed to be followed by such an entity. Indeed NER cl 6.5.2(j) quoted
above allows for virtually
any pattern of financing of such an entity. The
AEMC’s rule determination (AEMC, Rule Determination: National Electricity
Amendment (Economic Regulation of Network Service Providers) Rule 2012) noted at
7.4.1 (p 84) that “efficient benchmarking
service providers may have
different efficient debt management strategies”. Moreover, NER cl
6.5.2(k) implies that it in adopting
a change in methodology, consideration is
to be given to the effect on a hypothetical “benchmark efficient
entity”, not
the DNSP which is the subject of the determination. In
practice, of course, it is possible that the DNSP could be such an entity.
NER cl 6.5.2(k)(1) and (4) are not specific to the time periods to which regard
needs to be given. Thus, in subcl (k)(1), the
minimisation between allowed and
actual cost of debt (for a BEE) could refer to the regulatory control period, or
to the life of
the assets being (partially) financed by that debt. Similarly,
subcl (k)(4) could be interpreted as referring to only the two regulatory
control periods spanning the change in methodology, or to a longer period such
as the life of assets. One component of the dispute
between SAPN and the AER
effectively relates to different interpretations of these rules, with the AER
tending to focus on effects
over the life of the assets and SAPN focusing on the
current regulatory control period. In the Final Decision (Attachment 3, p 153)
the AER states that “[w]e discuss impacts that occur across regulatory
control periods, such as over the life of a benchmark
efficient entity’s
regulated assets. We consider the rules require us to do so.” It is the
view of this Tribunal that
the conclusion of whether the AER committed errors or
was unreasonable in making its decision on the transition process hinges upon
the validity of this interpretation of the rules.
noted above, the AER’s decision to adopt Option 2 is consistent with its
ROR Guideline published in December 2013, following
a draft document in August
2013. There, the AER stated that it would henceforth use a trailing average
portfolio approach for total
debt costs following completion of a transitional
period of 10 years (of the same form as that described for the risk-free
above). It argued that this approach would be adopted for all service
providers and that doing so would contribute to confidence
in the regulatory
process. DNSPs would therefore have been aware of the intended change some 18
months before it was due to come
into effect, enabling them to make some
adjustments to debt portfolio financing arrangements in anticipation.
its Explanatory Statement of the ROR Guideline (p 120) the AER referenced the
AEMC commentary regarding the motivation for the
2012 changes allowing for the
possibility of a transition period:
The purpose ... is for the regulator to have regard
to the impacts of changes in the methodology for estimating the return on debt
from one regulatory control period to another. Consideration should be given to
the potential for consumers and service providers
to face significant and
unexpected change in costs or prices that may have negative effects on
confidence in the predictability of
the regulatory arrangements. ...
Its purpose is to allow consideration of transitional strategies so that any
significant costs and practical difficulties in moving
from one approach to
another is taken into account.
the ROR Guideline at 6.1, it is stated that:
The allowed return on debt must be estimated such
that it contributes to the achievement of the allowed rate of return objective.
It should therefore provide compensation to a service provider for the debt
financing cost which is commensurate with the efficient
financing costs of a
benchmark efficient entity with a similar degree of
The regulatory decision process
provided its initial access proposal to the AER in October 2014, in which it
proposed transitioning to the new trailing average
approach for the cost of debt
(SAPN, Regulatory Proposal, pp 338-41). In that proposal the suggested approach
involved direct reference
to the cost of debt for a BBB rated entity rather than
separate examination of risk-free and DRP components. This was, in effect,
Option 2 approach chosen by the AER (although it did not separately identify the
risk-free and DRP components of borrowing costs),
and was consistent with the
AER’s ROR Guideline. On 6 February 2015, before the AER’s draft
decision in this case, SAPN
made a submission to the AER following the
AER’s November 2014 draft determinations for NSW DNSPs, which involved the
of Option 2. In this submission it recommended use of the hybrid
(Option 3) approach.
its Preliminary Decision in April 2015, the AER determined that Option 2,
consistent with SAPN’s original proposal, should
be adopted. It commented
that it was not clear that the NER allowed for SAPN to submit a changed proposal
such as via its 6 February
2015 submission (SAPN Preliminary Decision,
Attachment 3, p 129).
Subsequently in the Final Decision (Attachment 3, p 12) the AER noted:
In the preliminary decision we accepted SA Power
Networks’ initial proposal to adopt a transition applied to both the base
and debt risk premium components of the return on debt. Under the normal
decision making process, this means SA Power Networks could
not change its
position in the revised proposal. However, it appears the drafting of the
transitional arrangements in the NER leads
to an outcome which makes it possible
for service providers to depart from their proposal after the AER has accepted
it, and allows
them to introduce a new position after the preliminary decision
stage. Such an outcome raises concern on the relevance of the preliminary
decision process.
its Revised Proposal submitted in July 2015, SAPN explained at p 380 that the
significant fall in the DRP since submission of its
initial proposal, and the
implication of the high weight given to the “on-the-day” approach in
the Option 2 transition
process thus depressing the allowed rate of return was
one reason for its changed position. It also argued that the hybrid Option
approach was more consistent with the efficient financing processes of a
benchmark firm.
its Final Decision, the AER reaffirmed its decision to use Option 2 as the
transition method. Other issues where there were differences
in method for
determining the cost of debt between the AER decision and SAPN’s Revised
Proposal included adoption of a BBB+
rating rather than BBB rating for the BEE,
and sources of, and required adjustments to, data for determining the DRP for
debt of a BBB+ rated entity. These are not matters under review and
thus do not need consideration here.
Debt financing practices and regulation
is generally accepted that the debt financing practices of a regulated access
provider will be influenced by the specific features
of regulation. This is
because the regulatory approach will determine the allowed cost of debt, and
resulting revenue implications,
based on its assumed financing method. Risks to
the service provider of actual debt costs differing from the allowed cost (and
revenue allowed) will arise from differences between the financing pattern
adopted and that assumed in the regulatory process.
the previous “on-the-day” approach, an allowed return on debt was
determined at the start of the regulatory control
period and fixed for each of
the years in that period. Under the building block approach, the allowed
revenue over the period thus
included an amount sufficient to meet interest
payments on the debt financed component of the regulatory asset base in each
calculated using that specified cost of debt figure (and specified
leverage). If the entity had an actual cost of debt above or
below that figure
it would thus be, respectively, under-compensated or overcompensated for its
debt financing costs during that regulatory
control period.
avoid that risk, one option would be for the DNSP to arrange its debt finance
portfolio such that all debt would mature just prior
to the commencement of a
regulatory control period. It would then raise new debt at the same time
– when the allowed cost
of debt is determined. Doing so would, in
principle, mean that its actual cost of debt would match the allowed cost in the
new regulatory
control period (or differ only to the extent that its debt costs
were different to those of a BEE).
practice, a number of complications mean that such an approach is unlikely to be
consistent with efficient debt financing, and
possibly infeasible. Particularly
relevant to the current matter is the potential risks to the DNSP of attempting
to refinance its
entire debt portfolio at a specific point in time. It would
then be subject to risk of adverse movements in its borrowing costs
not compensated under the regulatory regime, which bases allowed cost of debt on
that applicable to a BEE. Such risks
could arise either from random shocks to
the DRP of the issuer, unwillingness of investors to absorb a large volume of
new debt from
the issuer, or opportunistic behaviour by lenders aware of the
issuer’s debt rollover requirements. While regulatory agreement
some private, pre-agreed, averaging period for calculating the cost of debt can
mitigate some of this risk, the concentration
of debt rollover within a
relatively short period is not generally accepted as good risk management
complication was that, in the on-the-day approach, the AER based the cost of
debt on an assumed 10-year maturity for debt,
even though the regulatory control
period was five years. Except in the highly unlikely event of five-year and
10-year debt having
the same cost at the start of the regulatory control period,
issuing five-year debt to match the five-year resetting of debt costs
occurs at the start of the next control, and thus hedge debt financing cost
risks, would lead to actual debt costs differing
from allowed debt costs. In
general, given an historical tendency for an upward sloping yield curve (10-year
rates greater than
five-year rates), the DNSP issuing five-year debt would tend
to have debt costs less than the corresponding allowable revenue, which
to some degree, compensate for the rollover risks in such a strategy.
generally, the DNSP’s allowed revenue over the regulatory control period
would also reflect debt (and equity) costs from
new funding to meet new capex,
but at the cost of debt allowed at the start of the regulatory control period.
The actual cost of
new debt funding during the period could be expected to
differ from the allowed cost existing at the start of the regulatory control
period creating risk for the DNSP. In principle, the DNSP could hedge that risk
by entering derivative contracts at the start of
the regulatory control period
to lock in the cost of a future debt-raising. However, depending on the slope
of the yield curve,
the resulting cost could be above or below the allowed cost
determined at the start of the regulatory control period, while uncertainties
for the DNSP.
than attempting to structure its debt portfolio to mature and be rolled over at
the start of the regulatory control period,
a BEE might adopt an alternative
approach to risk management. One such alternative approach for the DNSP is to
arrange to have a
maturity profile of debt which is relatively evenly spread
over some horizon such as 10 years, and use derivative contracts to attempt
hedge the interest rate risk associated with the “on-the-day”
determination of the allowable cost of debt. It might,
for example, issue some
amount of 10-year floating rate debt each year and enter interest rate swaps as
the fixed rate payer/floating
rate receiver at the start of each regulatory
control period. Then, for example, if it had floating rate debt on issue with 7
remaining maturity at the start of the regulatory control period, it could
enter a five-year swap at that date to fix the cost of
that debt for the next
five years. Then, at the start of the next regulatory control period it could
enter another five-year swap
which would fix the cost of that debt for the
remaining two years of its life as well as fixing the cost of new floating rate
to then be issued to replace it over the subsequent three years of the
regulatory control period.
because available derivative contracts are based on “risk-free”
benchmarks such as a bank bill swap rate or government
security rate, only the
risk-free component of the debt cost can be hedged in this way. The DRP
component of borrowing costs which
is determined at the time the debt financing
is taken out, and applies for the term of the financing, cannot generally be
Consequently, a DNSP which adopts a debt portfolio management strategy
involving a staggering of debt maturities will remain exposed
to the risk that
the DRP “on-the-day” of determination of allowable cost of debt will
differ from that applicable to
its existing debt portfolio (as well as future
rollovers of maturing debt during the regulatory control period).
decision to move towards an allowable cost of debt determination based on the
historical trailing average approach reflects recognition
that this is more
consistent with efficient debt management practices for a DNSP. With such a
regulatory approach in place, the
DNSP can minimize debt funding cost risks by
creating a debt maturity (or repricing) profile consistent with that assumed by
practice. Having 10% of its debt re-issued (or repriced) each year
as 10-year debt would remove exposure to movements in both the
component of debt costs and the DRP component applicable to a BEE. The DNSP
would still face the risk that the DRP they
were able to achieve was different
from that applicable to a BEE.
Implications of past financing practices and the transition
transition process for the risk-free component of debt costs is accepted by both
parties as appropriate. The reason is that an
immediate shift to the new
approach could involve potentially costly unwinding of hedging contracts put in
place to deal with the
risks of on-the-day determination of debt costs.
as noted above, issues associated with unwinding hedge contracts are only
relevant for the risk-free component of debt costs.
DNSPs are locked into the
DRP involved in their past funding decisions until those debt contracts mature.
AER transition approach means that differences between the historical average
DRP embedded in the debt portfolio of the DNSP as
at the start of this
regulatory control period are not reflected in the DRP included in allowable
cost of debt in the first year
(since the on-the-day approach applies there).
However, future DRP costs in rolling over existing debt and issuing additional
are, in principle, fully included. This is because the DRP in each
successive future year is included in the DRP component of allowable
with a 10% weight, with the weight of the on-the-day DRP reducing by 10 percent.
Maintaining
some weight for the on-the-day approach to the DRP component in the transition
process means that the DNSP incurs higher
or lower debt costs than allowed over
this regulatory control period if the on-the-day DRP differs from the trailing
historical average
DRP costs embedded in its debt portfolio at the start of the
regulatory control period. Consequently, if the historical trailing
average DRP
at the start of the regulatory control period exceeded the on-the-day figure (at
the start of the regulatory control
period) the allowable revenue in that
regulatory control period would be higher in each year from immediately shifting
3, and vice versa if it were lower. In the current case the
historical average exceeds the on-the-day figure implying higher revenue
Option 3 over the current regulatory control period, and in submissions SAPN
provided evidence that this would also apply over
the subsequent regulatory
control period.
Efficient investment and the regulatory approach to debt
cl 6.5.2.(k)(3) requires that in setting the cost of debt consideration be given
to “the incentives that the return on debt
may provide in relation to
capital expenditure over the regulatory control period, including as to the
timing of any capital expenditure”.
While the historical trailing average
approach is more compatible with actual debt management practices, it might be
be less consistent with determination of a cost of capital, and
allowable revenue and prices, required for efficient investment decisions.
using an on-the-day approach to determine cost of capital and thus allowable
revenues, the outcome – in theory at least –
is that the DNSP can
expect a revenue stream consistent with what a competitive market would
generate. Capital investment decisions
made at that date which meet a positive
NPV condition using the allowed rate of return would be efficient, based on
current conditions
in the market for funds. In contrast, if the DNSP assessed
capital investment options by reference to the rate of return incorporating
costs allowed from the trailing average approach, inefficient investment
decisions could result.
example, suppose allowable revenues for a very short-term project were based on
historical funding costs, and those were above
current market funding costs. By
undertaking that project abnormal profits could be made, because allowable
revenue implies a positive
NPV when evaluated at current market funding costs.
However, it is by no means clear that a sophisticated DNSP would make investment
decisions for the very long-lived assets required for its operations based on
past financing costs rather than current and expected
future financing costs.
It is the latter which determine, through the building block model, future
expected cash flows over the
long horizon involved. Nor should it be expected
that regulatory approval for capex plans would be based on an appraisal using
funding costs rather than current market conditions.
relevant in this context is the fact that the building block model using the
on-the-day approach implies a NPV=0 condition at
that date, in the sense that
expected cash flow streams from current assets or new capex are just sufficient
to match required returns
of investors. However, financial market conditions
can change substantially over the five-year horizon of a regulatory control
such that using the allowed cost of capital to assess potential
investments during the period could, again, lead to inefficient decisions.
However, to the extent that investments are very long-term (eg 80 years), and
future cash flows linked to future changes in cost
of capital (at the start of
each regulatory control period, or over a 10-year historical trailing average)
it is not obvious that
a sophisticated DNSP would act in this manner.
approach to debt costs also affects the risk facing the DNSP from investment
decisions, although there is no evidence provided
to the Tribunal that those
risks would be systematic and thus affect the cost of capital. Under the
on-the-day approach, a DNSP
which adopts a staggered-debt financing approach
experiences random differences between actual and allowed cost of debt (and thus
revenue) over the life of an investment. Arguably, these differences could be
expected to average out to zero over the long term,
and are not systematic risks
which would lead to a higher cost of equity capital than if a trailing
historical average approach were
the transition approach used will have implications for the extent to which past
differences in debt costs are locked in or
averaged out over the transition
period, and affect DNSP profitability over that period, that is not relevant to
forward looking
investment decisions. Because the choice between the trailing
historical average and on-the-day approaches to the costs of debt
affect long-term investment decisions, the form of transition should also have
no material implications for the efficiency
of future investment decisions.
Alleged errors in the Final Decision
argues that the AER decision to not adopt an immediate change to a trailing
average approach (Option 3), and instead deciding
on a gradual transition
approach (Option 2), for the DRP component of the allowable cost of debt was
wrong on each of the five considerations
involved. These were outlined at
Attachment 3, p 149 (and presented slightly differently in several cases at pp
170-1) of the Final
Decision. It is appropriate to adopt a different ordering
to that contained in the Final Decision reflecting the logic and approach
applied by the Tribunal in considering the arguments. It is noticeable that the
considerations on pp 170-1 make several references
to the consideration of
recovering efficient financing costs over the life of its assets, and this
permeated the AER discussion in
the Final Decision. This emphasis on
considerations relevant to “life of assets” rather than just the
current regulatory
control period is an important one raised by SAPN.
Promotion of efficient financing practices
consideration listed by the AER was “the impact on promoting efficient
financing practices consistent with the principles
of incentive based
regulation”. The AER accepts that both Option 2 and Option 3 are
consistent with this consideration (AER’s
Outline of Submissions, p 51).
SAPN focuses in its submission (Section C.4(a)) on the impact of the choice of
transition approach
on the consequences of past efficient financing practices
for the revenues of the BEE in the current (and future) regulatory control
periods. It is true that the consequences of past efficient financing practices
are affected by the choice of transition arrangement
(since the allowable cost
of debt in the forthcoming regulatory control period(s) differs) but this has no
consequences for choices
regarding future practices. But SAPN provides no
explanation as to how future financing arrangements would be affected in a
inconsistent with this consideration by the choice of transition
approach. Indeed, the arguments advanced by SAPN about inability
to hedge the
DRP component of existing debt costs suggests that these are akin to “sunk
costs” and, while relevant to
profitability impacts from the choice of
transition are not relevant to future debt financing decisions. The Tribunal is
view that the AER committed no error of fact, incorrect exercise of
discretion, or was unreasonable in reaching its conclusion that
both Options 2
and 3 were consistent with this first consideration.
Bias in regulatory decision-making
consideration of the AER was avoiding “a potential bias in regulatory
decision-making that can arise from choosing an
approach that uses historical
data after the results of that historical data is already known”. SAPN
argues in its Outline
of Submissions (at para 279) that the AER made an error of
discretion and was unreasonable in preferring Option 2 over Option 3 on
basis because:
(a) the AER was incorrect to find that it was a
desirable feature of the AER transition that it avoided a relevant bias in
decision making;
(b) the AER was incorrect to find that the hybrid transition gave rise to a
relevant bias in regulatory decision making; and
(c) concerns as to the nature of the bias raised by the AER were not relevant
to, and could not override, the requirement of cl 6.5.2,
to estimate the return
on debt for a regulatory year such that it contributes to the achievement of the
allowed rate of return objective.
is hardly surprising that in proposing a one-off transition arrangement in
moving from one procedure for choosing the cost of debt
to an alternative
procedure, a DNSP would prefer and recommend the option which, given the
information available, is to its advantage.
In this case, Option 3 is clearly
preferable to the DNSP because the immediate adoption of the historical trailing
average means
that the DRP component of debt costs over the regulatory control
period will reflect higher past values of the DRP. Chairmont Consulting
provided evidence to the AER that had the transition process started between
2011 and 2014, the historical pattern of the DRP would
have led to the opposite
outcome: Final Decision, Attachment 3, p 149. In contrast, the Option 2
transition does not incorporate
those historical values. Future values of the
DRP impact equivalently on the allowable DRP component of debt costs in future
under both Option 2 and Option 3.
answer to the contentions of SAPN is that the AER’s approach involved
“starting with an on-the-day rate and gradually
transitioning to the
trailing average approach (Option 2) [which] only uses averaging periods for
each year that are nominated in
advance” (Final Decision, Attachment 3, p
Tribunal is of the view that this approach is a valid one, involving the AER
considering alternative transition approaches to
the one proposed by SAPN, in
order to avoid a bias in regulatory decision-making. In determining which among
the alternative transition
options should be chosen, the AER was endeavouring to
reach a decision that contributes to the ARORO. This approach by the AER was
Historical data problems
consideration listed by the AER was avoiding “practical problems with the
use of historical data as estimating the return
on debt during the global
financial crisis is a difficult and contentious exercise” (Final Decision,
Attachment 3, p 149).
Use of Option 3 would require use of such data, whereas
Option 2 avoids the need to consider such historical data. The AER noted
this was a relatively minor issue compared to other considerations.
is the case that there are some difficulties in accurately determining what the
historical DRP on 10-year debt issued by a “BBB+”
rated BEE would
have been in each of the 10 years preceding the start of the current regulatory
control period. Two factors are
this period incorporates the global financial crisis which meant that the DRP on
outstanding bonds and new bond issues was
significantly elevated in the years
following 2007 when financial markets were disrupted. While the DRP on loans
from banks can
also be assumed to have increased at that time, there is no
readily available evidence on whether the increase was higher or lower
seen in bond markets. And it could be anticipated that the efficient financing
practice for a BEE would have involved
choosing to raise debt finance through
the cheaper of the two alternatives (debt issue or bank loan). This might
suggest that DRP
figures from the bond market might be an upper bound on the
achievable DRP unless there was significant use of the bond market by
entities at that time. On the other hand, given elevated borrowing costs,
efficient financial management may have involved
greater temporary use of equity
financing (such as via increased earnings retention) rather than use of debt
markets. Alternatively,
at times when the DRP was perceived to be unusually and
temporarily high, shorter-term debt might have been used to avoid locking
that high level of DRP.
considerations suggest that observable DRP figures from this period might be
noisy estimates of the DRP (both in terms of the
percentage cost and also actual
dollar cost if leverage changed temporarily) of a BEE. However, this is no
different in principle
to potentially similar problems in accuracy of DRP
estimation which may occur in future years. Moreover, such data was used in the
previous AER determination of cost of debt for the regulatory control period
2010-2014, suggesting that concerns about the validity
of the historical data
from that date onwards should not be paramount. Arguably, estimating
appropriate DRP figures for the preceding
several years (2007-2009) associated
with the financial crisis may be problematic and contentious. However, this is
not an argument
for not incorporating such data, particularly since it is
eventually phased out of the trailing historical average.
second issue is the robustness of the interest rate data available from
providers of such data for the use required here. Several
commercial providers
track returns on corporate debt of issuers of different credit ratings.
However, there are relatively few domestic
corporate bond issues in Australia,
and their remaining maturity is extremely unlikely to be exactly 10 years.
Consequently to estimate
the yield and DRP on a 10-year maturity of a BBB+ rated
entity requires a number of approximations, including interpolation or
extrapolation
of rates or DRPs available for different maturities. The
complexities are well outlined in the Final Decision, Attachment 3, pp
In response, SAPN notes (Outline of Submissions, C4(e)) that alternative
approaches involving averaging of various sources
do not involve major
differences in estimates when averaged over a number of years.
can be significant debate about the merits of alternative approaches. The
Tribunal notes that the issue of extracting reasonable
estimates of the
historical DRP from available, but non-robust, past data appear inherently no
more problematic than estimating many
other inputs into the PTRM such as the
current cost of equity or the valuation of imputation credits.
Tribunal is of the view that while there are undoubtedly problems with obtaining
accurate estimates of the DRP of a BEE over earlier
years of the decade prior to
the start of the regulatory control period, this is not a sufficient reason to
reject the use of the
Option 3 transition approach. The Tribunal does not
accept that the AER was in error or its decision was unreasonable in considering
the reliability of the historical information.
Impact of change on BEE and recovery of efficient financing
Tribunal’s analysis of the three preceding contentions does not
demonstrate the errors claimed by SAPN. Thus the matter
hinges on the final two
considerations.
final two considerations listed by the AER are somewhat interrelated, and
dependent upon a common item. That common item is the
question of whether the
application of the reference to “across regulatory control periods”
should refer solely to the
periods before and after the change in methodology,
or involve a longer horizon. This involves looking at the NER as a whole. Also
important is the question of whether the choice of transition approach creates
or enshrines “windfall gains or losses”
to either the DNSP or its
customers which are inconsistent with incentive based regulation.
relevant considerations in its approach listed by the AER affecting this issue
are having regard to (a) “the impact on a
benchmark efficient entity of
changing the method for estimating the return on debt in one regulatory control
period to the next”
and (b) that it “provides a benchmark efficient
entity with a reasonable opportunity to recover at least the efficient financing
costs it incurs in financing its assets. And as a result it: [p]romotes
efficient investment, and [p]romotes consumers not paying
more than necessary
for a safe and reliable network” (Final Decision, Attachment 3, p 149).
latter consideration is alternatively expressed by the AER as consideration of
“matching the allowed rate of return with
efficient financing cashflows
over a single regulatory period, and the potential conflict between this
consideration and providing
a benchmark efficient entity with a reasonable
opportunity to recover efficient financing costs over the life of its
(Final Decision, Attachment 3, pp 170-1).
assessing the arguments, it is useful to refer to the NER which states that in
determining the return on debt regard must be had
to “the desirability of
minimising any difference between the return on debt and the return on debt of a
benchmark efficient
entity referred to in the allowed rate of return
objective” (NER cl 6.5.2(k)(1)) and “any impacts (including in
to the costs of servicing debt across regulatory control periods) on a
benchmark efficient entity referred to in the allowed rate
of return objective
that could arise as a result of changing the methodology that is used to
estimate the return on debt from one
regulatory control period to the
next.” (NER cl 6.5.2(k)(4))
has been already noted that the AER, in deciding to move to a trailing
historical average approach, has adopted a perspective that
a characteristic of
a BEE is that it would (a) adopt a financing policy involving a staggered-debt
portfolio, and (b) hedge the risk-free
component of debt costs associated with
the on-the-day approach through use of swaps (Final Decision, Attachment 3, p
would leave that entity exposed to differences arising between the
average historical DRP embedded in its debt portfolio and the
on-the-day DRP.
If the embedded DRP exceeds the on-the-day figure the allowed revenue for debt
costs would not cover actual costs,
and vice versa. For such an entity, NER cl
6.5.2(k)(1), if considered in isolation and interpreted as referring to
minimizing year-by-year
differences, would imply that Option 3 would be the
appropriate choice.
(Outline of Submissions, paras 232 and 248) notes that:
The AER’s interpretation of the factor in
clause 6.5.2(k)(1) is not a matter in dispute, save that SA Power Networks
that it is properly applied on a forward-looking basis in each year of
the regulatory control period. That is, the factor is properly
understood as
requiring regard to be had to the desirability of minimising any difference
between the return on debt allowance the
AER sets for each year of the relevant
regulatory control period (the allowed return on debt) and the cost of debt a
benchmark efficient
entity would incur each year of that regulatory control
period, based on the AER’s assumptions of the efficient financing
of a benchmark efficient entity (the actual return on debt).
SA Power Networks contends that it is plain that rate of return objective
requires the return on debt to be estimated so that the
return on debt is
commensurate with the efficient financing costs that a benchmark efficient
entity would incur each year over the
relevant regulatory control
argues that (at para 247), in contrast:
the justification that appears to be proffered by the
AER in the Final Decision is that the NER only require compensation for
financing costs over a longer period referred to as “the life of
the relevant assets”.
this regard NER (cl 6.5.2(k)(4) also requires consideration of the impact on
cost of servicing debt across regulatory control periods.
The AER applies the
notion of “across regulatory control periods” as extending beyond
the two periods immediately before
and after the change in regulatory
methodology and referring to “the life of the relevant assets”.
Consequently, it
argues that in taking a longer perspective differences in the
allowed and actual cost of debt in individual years and over regulatory
periods under the on-the-day approach can be expected to balance out over time.
The historical trailing average approach
also achieves that balance of allowed
and actual cost of debt over the longer time horizon, but also on a year-by-year
its Final Decision (Attachment 3, p 167) the AER stated that “[w]e
consider the efficient debt financing costs of a benchmark
efficient entity as
those which are expected to minimise its debt financing costs over the life of
its assets, while managing refinancing
risk and interest rate risk”.
AER argues at pp 174-5 that this is equivalent to applying the NPV principle
which it defines as follows:
The NPV principle is that the expected present value
of a benchmark efficient entity’s regulated revenue should reflect the
expected present value of its expenditure, plus or minus any efficiency
incentive rewards or penalties. In other words, departures
from cost recovery
are acceptable and desirable, so long as they are the result of management
induced efficiencies or inefficiencies,
rather than windfall gains or losses.
Windfall gains or losses would result in a service provider being over- or
under-compensated
for its efficient costs. The building block model which the
NGR require us to use is based on this principle.
Tribunal is of the view that the AER has not erred in applying the provision of
NER cl 6.5.2(k)(4) in referring to a longer time
period, such as that
involved in recovery of efficient financing costs over the life of the asset.
The theoretical basis of the
PTRM and the NER are premised on such an approach
which involves determining allowable cash flows such that an NPV=0 condition is
met ex ante. It is true that this NPV=0 condition is implemented via the PTRM
so as to apply as at the start of each regulatory
period for that period.
However, the inclusion of the end of period regulatory asset base in that
calculation (such that the opening
regulatory asset base equals the present
values of cash flows plus end-of-period regulatory asset base) implies that this
one stage in a sequence of such decisions aimed at achieving NPV=0 over
the life of the assets.
BEE may adopt a different financing structure to that implied in the PTRM
calculation, such as using a staggered-debt portfolio
rather than an on-the-day
rollover approach. This could lead to it facing a non-zero NPV situation for
any regulatory period. But
it can be assumed that it would only do so if it
anticipated that over the longer term (life of the assets) such non-zero NPV
would tend to balance out.
interpretation of NER cl 6.5.2(k)(4) has two consequences. First, it means that
the argument of SAPN that Option 3 involves
smaller year-by-year differences
between the actual cost of debt and that allowable over the current regulatory
control period is
not, of itself, sufficient to prefer Option 3 over Option 2.
Second, it then requires identifying whether one of the two transition
is more consistent with recovery of efficient financing costs over the life of
assets, or involves impacts on the BEE which
are judged to be, in the context of
the NEL objectives, worse. Unfortunately, in this regard, the NER
cl 6.5.2(k)(4) provides no
guidance on how to assess such impacts. Nor is
such criteria explicitly specified in the NEL. Section 7A(2) of the NEL
A regulated network service provider should be
provided with a reasonable opportunity to recover at least the efficient costs
operator incurs in–
(a) providing direct control network services; and
(b) complying with a regulatory obligation or requirement or making a
regulatory payment.
s 7A(3) a further consideration relevant to this situation is specified
... The economic efficiency that should be promoted
(a) efficient investment in a distribution system or transmission system with
which the operator provides direct control network services;
(b) the efficient provision of electricity network services; and
(c) the efficient use of the distribution system or transmission system with
which the operator provides direct control network
7A(2) does not imply recovery of costs within a particular regulatory control
period such that the AER focus on “the
life of the asset” is not
inconsistent with the NEO. Section 7A(3)(c) indicates that in determining
allowable revenue and
prices, the AER should take into account the impact of its
decisions on demand for electricity network services. Thus it would be
appropriate for the AER to consider impacts both on consumers and DNSPs in
arriving at a decision on the choice of transition approach.
AER’s argument that Option 2 is better aligned with the NEO than is Option
3 is based on consideration of the effects of
the transition on a BEE which had
adopted a staggered-debt portfolio approach under the previous on-the-day
regime. There is no
dispute that this is a suitable characterisation of a BEE,
and that the BEE would be able to hedge the resulting risk on the risk-free
component of its debt, but would be subject to the risk that the DRP allowed for
any regulatory control period differed from its
actual embedded DRP for that
AER argues (in its Outline of Submissions at para 185) that regulatory decisions
which generate windfall gains or losses (to either
DNSPs or their customers) are
undesirable:
The AER observed that departures from cost recovery
are acceptable and desirable so long as they are the result of management
efficiencies or inefficiencies, rather than windfall gains or
the Final Decision, there is considerable discussion about whether allowed DRPs
differed from actual DRPs over past regulatory
control periods, and SAPN focuses
on this as the potential source of windfall gains or losses. It argues that
there is no authority
for subsequent “squaring up” which it
interprets the AER decision as involving. That argument implies that an allowed
DRP less than the actual (of a staggered-debt portfolio) in the current
regulatory period under Option 2 is offsetting the reverse
situation in previous
periods. SAPN stated in its Outline of Submissions (at para 264)
Even if it was permissible for the AER to have regard
to the motion of the balance of under and over recovery over time (which it
not, for the reasons discussed above), as the AER’s Final Decision would
result in a benchmark efficient entity in the position
of SA Power Networks
facing the costs of a trailing average DRP which is in excess of the prevailing
DRP, the AER can only reach
a conclusion that its transition provides a
benchmark efficient entity with a reasonable opportunity to recover at least
costs if it is satisfied that:
(a) a benchmark efficient entity in the position of SA Power Networks would,
at the beginning of the 2015-20 regulatory control period,
have an accumulated
gain comprising the difference between the DRP costs it had faced in the past
and the regulatory allowance provided
for this component of the return on debt;
(b) the AER transition will erode that accumulated gain to zero (and no more
or less) over the course of the AER’s
transition.
argued at para 252 that:
cl 6.5.2 of the NER must be interpreted as requiring
a return that is sufficient to recover efficient financing costs in each
year of the regulatory control period. Neither the NER or the Law
permit the AER to reduce the return on debt allowance below the
efficient financing costs in an attempt to “claw back” or square-up
differences between the allowed return on
debt and the return on debt faced by a
benchmark service provider in a previous regulatory
is some lack of clarity in the AER’s discussion of this issue. For
example, in the Final Decision (Attachment 3, pp 562-3)
the AER argues
a consistent application of either the on-the-day or
trailing average approach ... promotes revenue with an expected present value
equal to the present value of the entity’s efficient costs. This outcome
is consistent with the NPV principle which we discussed
further below. However,
when the method to estimate the return on debt changes during the life of
regulated assets; the NPV principle
is unlikely to hold automatically. Any
existing accumulated differences between the allowed and actual return on debt
of a benchmark
efficient entity would remain. As a result, the service provider
will receive a return on debt that is different from that of a
efficient entity, and consumers will pay prices that reflect this
difference.
is possible to interpret the above statement as referring to past gains or
losses as at the date of switching from an existing
regulatory approach to
another approach That would prompt a focus on how a particular transition
process would, or would not, involve
some “squaring up” element.
However, while the AER devoted considerable space to discussing the past
behaviour of the
DRP, this was not an apparent consideration in its preference
for Option 2. In its Final Decision (Attachment 3, p 569) the AER
states that,
despite examining the issue and available data “we have not relied on
analysis of whether our transitional approach
will erode past windfall gains or
losses in making our decision”.
the AER’s approach is premised on examining whether a particular
transition approach would itself create “windfall
gains or losses”
arising over the current (and subsequent) transition period. Its approach is
based on analysis of the NPV=0
principle underlying the PTRM, which implies that
for each component of costs (return on capital, return of capital, opex etc), a
corresponding component of the revenue stream with zero anticipated NPV is
allowed. It then considers the total debt portfolio of
a BEE as a set of annual
tranches of debt issued in each of the past 10 years and examines the
consequences of a transition approach
for each of those tranches.
previously outlined, under the previous “on-the-day approach” a BEE
which refinanced all debt at the start of the regulatory
control period would be
assured of allowed debt costs equal to actual during that period. In contrast,
a BEE which adopted a staggered-debt
portfolio (and hedged the risk-free
component) would accept risks of future deviations of actual embedded debt costs
from allowed
debt costs. Over the long-term (such as the life of assets) these
deviations might average out as debt raised in a particular year
matures and is
refinanced at prevailing rates.
a shift to the historical trailing average approach is completed there is no
annual divergence between allowed and actual debt
costs for each annual tranche
of debt issued by the BEE.
AER argues that, under the on-the-day approach, such a BEE would have
anticipated that each annual tranche of debt could have
experienced future
differences between the allowed and its actual debt cost. For example, a BEE
which issued 10-year debt seven
years prior to the start of the current
regulatory control period would have expected that the allowed DRP for the
remaining three
years to maturity of that debt would be set under the on-the-day
approach and could differ from its actual DRP.
if the allowed DRP on that tranche of debt is set according to a different rule
during the transition period, a different outcome
to that based on the
anticipated application of the existing rule when the debt was issued would
occur as a result of the regulatory
decision. In this sense, there would be
“windfall gains or losses” on that tranche of debt occurring during
the transition
period. Option 2 avoids this outcome for previously issued debt.
It also means that debt which is issued (either new debt to fund
rolling over of maturing debt) in the transition period would have no difference
between allowed and actual debt costs over
the term of that debt.
AER stated in its Final Decision (Attachment 3, p 158):
Our approach is designed such that service providers
will face the outcomes on their debt raising decisions consistent with the
expectations
when that debt was issued. That is, for debt issued under the
previous return on debt regime, outcomes will be consistent with those
would have arisen under the previous regime. For debt issued under the new
regime, outcomes will be as per the trailing average
portfolio. We are
satisfied this approach achieves the NPV=0 principle in expectation, and is
symmetrical and unbiased.
AER argues that this is consistent with principles of incentive regulation,
where a BEE adopting a staggered-debt portfolio approach
under the on-the-day
approach took financing risks from which it might gain or lose. It stated in
its Final Decision (Attachment
One of our reasons for this approach is so service
providers face the financial outcomes of their past financing decisions, whether
positive or negative, consistent with the principles of incentive regulation.
Accordingly, the impact on a benchmark efficient entity is not, in principle,
different to the impact on a benchmark efficient entity
if we had continued to
adopt the on-the-day approach. This means that there is a minimal impact on the
level of financial risk faced
by a benchmark efficient entity as a result of
changing the return on debt methodology from one regulatory control period to
Attachment 3, pp 181-2, the AER argued its preference for Option 2 as:
In these circumstances, departures from the NPV
principle do not result from efficiency gains or losses, but from changing the
regime. For this reason, we consider the resulting benefits or
detriments are windfall gains or losses that the change in methodology
estimating the return on debt should avoid. In other words, regardless of who
faces the benefit or detriment, an immediate change
from one return on debt
method to another could have undesirable consequences. This possibility should
concern both service providers
and consumers. This is because, prior to a
change in method occurring, neither could know whether they would face a benefit
or detriment.
AER had, in its ROR guidelines, flagged that a gradual transition (equivalent to
Option 2) was its intended approach because it
would reduce the potential for
“windfall gains or losses” arising from the change in regulatory
approach impacting adversely
on either consumers or the BEE (and to the benefit
of the other). The Tribunal accepts that this position, stated well before this
regulatory determination, is consistent with the NEO, and thus preferable to the
alternative (Option 3).
Tribunal is of the view that the AER has committed no error of fact or been
unreasonable in reaching the conclusion that Option
2 is preferable on grounds
of the “impact of change on benchmark efficient entity and recovery of
efficient financing costs”.
Its interpretation of “across
regulatory periods” as involving more than just the periods immediately
surrounding the
change in regulatory approach, and leading to consideration of
effects over the life of the asset, is consistent with the NER. That
the attention paid by the AER to the NPV=0 criterion, which in turn leads it to
consider whether one particular transition
approach is more consistent with that
criterion than the other. In that regard, it does not undertake a comparison
based on offsetting
historical excesses or deficiencies in the allowed DRP
relative to actual. Rather, it assesses which approach is more consistent
meeting expectations held of how future DRP values would be determined when
particular annual tranches of debt were issued.
It concludes, correctly in the
view of the Tribunal, that Option 2 is preferable in that regard because it does
not create windfall
gains or losses in the current regulatory period from the
regulatory change.
grounds of review on the cost of debt are rejected.

Application of the NER
is important to note that the AER’s decision in relation to the Bushfire
Mitigation Capex Program is only one component of
the AER’s overall
decision in relation to forecast capex.
cl 6.12.1(3) of the NER, the AER’s determination must include a decision
in which the AER either:
(i) acting in accordance with clause 6.5.7(c),
accepts the total of the forecast capital expenditure for the regulatory control
that is included in the current building block proposal; or
(ii) acting in accordance with clause 6.5.7(d), does not accept the total of
the forecast capital expenditure for the regulatory control
period that is
included in the current building block proposal, in which case the AER must set
out its reasons for that decision

Clause 6.5.7(a) addresses the capex objectives,

forecast capital expenditure for the relevant regulatory control period which
the Distribution Network Service Provider considers is required in order to
achieve each of the following (the capital expenditure
objectives):
(1) meet or manage the expected demand

(2) comply with all applicable regulatory obligations or requirements
associated with the provision of standard control services;
(3) to the extent that there is no applicable regulatory obligation or
requirement in relation to:
(i) the quality, reliability
or security of supply of standard control services; or

control services; and
(iv) maintain the reliability and security of the distribution system
through the supply of standard control services;
(4) maintain the safety of the

6.5.7(c) directs the AER to consider whether proposed capex meets the capex
criteria. It provides:
The AER must accept the forecast of required capital

reaching its decision the AER said (Final Decision, Attachment 6, pp
We are not satisfied that the additional capex for
the proposed bushfire mitigation program is efficient additional capex that the
prudent operator would require to maintain the reliability and safety of the
network, or to comply with regulatory obligations or
requirements. As such, we
do not accept SA Power Network’s capex proposal to spend $38.9 million on
its bushfire mitigation
program. We find that SA Power Network’s Revised
Regulatory Proposal, and our alternative estimate, already factor in a
level of capex related to its business-as-usual bushfire risk
management.
As we noted in the preliminary decision, the evidence before us indicates
that SA Power Networks is meeting its existing obligations,
and historically,
its bushfire risk management has been effective. The Office of the Technical
Regulator has confirmed that SA Power
Networks currently satisfies existing
regulations and standards relating to managing
AER provided a summary of its decision immediately following this conclusion (at
pp 82-3). It is helpful to reproduce that summary
as much of it is
specifically challenged by SAPN:
In summary we consider
The information before us does not satisfy us that
section 60 of the SA Electricity Industry Act requires SA Power Networks to
bushfire mitigation capex, in addition to capex that it may be required to
incur in order to comply with other, more specific requirements
under the SA
Electricity Industry Act.
contrary to SA Power Networks’ assertion, the information before us
does not demonstrate that the practices now adopted by Victorian
networks are
required to be adopted in order for a prudent South Australian network operator
to achieve the capex objectives. SA
Power Networks’ bushfire risk and
network construction is different from its Victorian counterparts.
SA Power Networks is in a position to manage an increase in bushfire risk if
it eventuates, given its legislated power to cut off
the power to specific parts
of the network in high bushfire risk situations.
SA Power Networks has improved its fire start performance to date with
business-as-usual expenditure, in compliance with its obligation
under the NER
to maintain the safety of the distribution system
SA Power Networks has maintained its compliance with its obligations under
Work Health and Safety Act
, and there is no indication that the Act will be
amended to increase SA Power Networks’ obligations.
contrary to SA Power Networks assertions that a cost/benefit analysis for
the bushfire mitigation program is not feasible, it could
have provided a cost
benefit analysis based on the ‘As Low As Reasonably Practical’ risk
mitigation principle.
while we accept that SA Power Networks proposed SCADA reclosers program may
mitigate fire start risks, we have provided funding for
the replacement of aging
reclosers in our repex allowance.
the proposed surge arrestors program is not efficient capex that a prudent
network operator would need to make to achieve the capex
objectives. Further,
SA Power Networks has been given additional repex that addresses increased asset
replacement needs.
the proposed metered mains project is not efficient capex that a prudent
network operator would incur .
these reasons the AER concluded that SAPN’s capex for the Bushfire
Mitigation Capex Program did not satisfy the capex criteria.
Areas of dispute
is undisputed that the AER assessed SAPN’s proposed Bushfire Mitigation
Capex Program in two steps. First it assessed SAPN’s
compliance with its
safety related obligations and its ability to manage bushfire risk. Secondly it
assessed the prudency and efficiency
of the bushfire mitigation projects,
relevantly the SCADA reclosers and surge arresters.
this approach, the AER provided nine reasons for its decision – reproduced
in the summary above. The first eight
of these reasons (the ninth – the
metered mains component – not being pressed here) are reproduced in
SAPN’s Amended
Application and dealt with extensively in the written
submissions of both parties.
argues that the relationship amongst these eight reasons does not clearly emerge
from the AER’s decision. That it is unclear,
among other things, whether
the AER considers that each of the reasons is individually sufficient to produce
the result that the
AER was not satisfied with the Bushfire Mitigation Capex
is also critical of the AER’s failure to identify how each of these
reasons relates to the matters to which the AER was
required to have regard,
namely the capex objectives and the capex criteria.
its Amended Application at para 142, SAPN contends that the Bushfire Mitigation
Capex decision of the AER was based on an incorrect
construction and application
of the NER. In particular:
(a) the AER erred in construing cl 6.5.7(a)(2) of the
NER as only giving rise to an altered standard of obligation by reference to
whether specific legislative provisions had been amended. It failed to have
regard to the objective content of such regulatory obligations
at the relevant
time. As a consequence, the AER failed to have proper regard to SA Power
Network’s actual regulatory obligations
and requirements;
(b) the AER erred in assessing the prudency and efficiency of the Bushfire
Mitigation Capex Program by reference to whether a sufficient
level of capex
related expenditure had already been provided for ‘business-as-usual
bushfire risk management’, in circumstances
in which there was no specific
business as usual bushfire risk management capex allowance; and
(c) the AER erred in determining that cl 5.2.1(a) of the NER is not a
regulatory obligation or requirement that imposes any augmentation
obligation on a network service provider; specifically the AER erred in
construing the provision as being limited to maintenance
opex and as precluding
capex designed to enhance the safety of the South Australian distribution
a consequence of this incorrect construction and application of the NER, SAPN
contends that the AER exercised its discretion incorrectly
and made a decision
that was unreasonable, having regard to all the circumstances.
AER is critical of SAPN’s Amended Application for alleging numerous errors
but failing to specify the category of error
being alleged. It suggests the
problem is compounded by SAPN’s written submissions which are said not to
be closely tied to
the grounds of review in the Amended Application, making it
difficult to discern whether the submissions are addressing grounds of
raised in the Amended Application, or raising new grounds of review.
AER considers that the difficulties are exemplified by SAPN’s overarching
argument that the AER should have assessed whether
the proposed Bushfire
Mitigation Capex Program:
was required to
comply with a regulatory obligation or requirement for the purposes of cl
6.5.7(a)(2) of the NER; or
alternatively,
was required to maintain the safety of the distribution system for the purposes
of cl 6.5.7(a)(4).
contends that had the AER determined that the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program
met the capex objectives it was then
to be satisfied
that the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program met the capex criteria and approve
the program; or
to substitute
the cost sought by SAPN for the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program with an
alternative amount that the AER was satisfied
would meet the capex
maintains that the AER failed to clearly address these steps.
AER’s criticism of the way SAPN presented its case also extends to aspects
of SAPN’s written submissions which address
matters of construction of the
NER and legislation in South Australia.
Tribunal does observe a change in emphasis between the Amended Application and
SAPN’s written submissions. This became
more pronounced during oral
argument where counsel for SAPN devoted a degree of attention – more than
might first appear to
have naturally emerged from the Amended Application
– to several points of construction of the NER and legislation in support
of the view that the capex objectives had been satisfied, contrary to the view
held by the AER.
the AER’s criticism of the “disconnect” between SAPN’s
Amended Application and its written submissions,
it nevertheless responded to
SAPN’s arguments in its written submissions.
Compliance with a regulatory obligation or requirement under
cl 6.5.7(a)(2) of the NER
argued that the correct approach is to first inquire whether the Bushfire
Mitigation Capex Program is necessary in order to comply
with a regulatory
obligation or requirement under cl 6.5.7(a)(2), as part of the capex
objectives.
expression “regulatory obligation or requirement” as used in the
capex objectives, is defined in s 2D of the NEL,
and includes:
a distribution
system safety duty in relation to the provision of an electricity network
service by a regulated network service provider;
an obligation or
requirement under the NEL or the NER.
expression “distribution system safety duty” is defined in s 2(1) of
the NEL as follows:
distribution system safety duty means a duty or
requirement under an Act of a participating jurisdiction, or any instrument made
issued under or for the purposes of that Act, relating
(a) the safe distribution of electricity
in that jurisdiction; or
(b) the safe operation of a distribution system in that
expression “participating jurisdiction” is defined in
relevantly as follows:
(1) The following jurisdictions are participating
(a) the State of South Australia;
(b) the Commonwealth, a Territory or a State (other than South Australia) if
there is in force, as part of the law of that jurisdiction,
corresponds to
National Electricity (South Australia) Act 1996
South Australia.
points to three regulatory obligations it considers trigger cl 6.5.7(a)(2),
through the combined operation of these definitions.
They are (collectively the
Obligations
the obligation
to take reasonable steps to ensure that infrastructure is safe and safely
operated under
Electricity Act
the obligation
to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, that the health and safety of
workers and other persons is not put at
risk: ss 5, 18 and 19 of the WHS Act;
the obligation
to maintain and operate all equipment that is part of their facilities in
accordance with good electricity practice
and Australian Standards, within the
meaning of cl 5.2.1(a) and Ch 10 of the NER.
Electricity Act
(1) A person who owns or operates electricity
infrastructure or an electrical installation must take reasonable steps to
ensure that–
(a) the infrastructure or installation
complies with, and is operated in accordance with, technical and safety
requirements imposed
under the regulations; and
(b) the infrastructure or installation is safe and safely
19(1) of the WHS Act provides:
(1) A person conducting a business or undertaking
must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety
(a) workers engaged, or caused to be
engaged by the person; and
(b) workers whose activities in carrying out work are influenced or directed
by the person,
while the workers are at work in the business or
undertaking.
18 of the WHS Act defines “reasonably practicable” as
reasonably practicable, in relation to a duty to
ensure health and safety, means that which is, or was at a particular time,
able to be done in relation to ensuring health and safety, taking
into account and weighing up all relevant matters
(a) the likelihood of the hazard or the
risk concerned occurring; and
(b) the degree of harm that might result from the hazard or the risk;
(c) what the person concerned knows, or ought reasonably to know,
(i) the hazard or the risk;
(ii) ways of eliminating or minimising the risk;
(d) the availability and suitability of
ways to eliminate or minimise the risk; and
(e) after assessing the extent of the risk and the available ways of
eliminating or minimising the risk, the cost associated with
available ways of
eliminating or minimising the risk, including whether the cost is grossly
disproportionate to the risk.
5.2.1(a) of the NER requires that:
(a) All Registered Participants must maintain and
operate (or ensure their authorised representatives maintain and operate) all
that is part of their facilities in accordance
(1) relevant laws;
(2) the requirements of the Rules; and
(3) good electricity industry practice and relevant Australian
expression “good electricity industry practice” is defined, in Ch 10
of the NER, as:
The exercise of that degree of skill, diligence,
prudence and foresight that reasonably would be expected from a significant
of operators of facilities forming part of the power system for the
generation, transmission or supply of electricity under conditions
comparable to
those applicable to the relevant facility consistent with applicable regulatory
instruments, reliability, safety and
environmental protection. The
determination of comparable conditions is to take into account factors such as
the relative size,
duty, age and technological status of the relevant facility
and the applicable regulatory instruments.
submits that these provisions are indeterminate in scope and therefore describe
categories of indeterminate reference which may
be satisfied by conduct of
various kinds. That is, they do not narrowly prescribe a series of specific
actions that SAPN must take.
AER agreed with this characterisation and was therefore surprised that SAPN
appeared to be suggesting in its written submissions
that its Bushfire
Mitigation Capex Program was of determinative scope and therefore within its
terms, a regulatory obligation or
requirement.
that indeed was the position held by SAPN, it had moved on by the time of the
hearing. Counsel for SAPN said (at Transcript, pp
Can I turn then to the first issue for consideration,
which is whether the Bushfire Mitigation Program was required to be undertaken
in order to comply with a regulatory obligation or requirement. Can I
interpolate and note that in our submissions at 425 and 452,
we use a shorthand
for this notion.
SAPN, of course, doesn’t contend that the bushfire
program is itself a regulatory obligation. It contends that effecting it
necessary to fulfil an obligation.
As the tribunal is aware by clause
6.5.7(a)(2) of the rules, compliance with all applicable regulatory obligations
or requirements
that are associated with standard control services is one of the
capex objectives. Standard control services are, through the combined
of chapter 10 of the rules and section 2B of the law, services regulated under a
distribution determination.
SAPN contends that three distinct but overlapping regulatory obligations
require it to undertake the program.
They are the obligation to take
reasonable steps to ensure that infrastructure is safe and safely operated under
Electricity Act
, the obligation to ensure, as far as is
reasonably practicable, that the health and safety of workers and other persons
at risk. That’s section 5, 18 and 19 of the
Work Health and
. And, finally, the obligation to maintain and operate all equipment
that’s part of their facilities in accordance with good
electricity
industry practice and Australian standards within the meaning of clause 5.2.1(a)
and chapter 10 of the rules. It will,
of course, suffice if but one of these
obligations is a regulatory obligation requirement within the meaning of the
capex objectives,
and the tribunal concludes that the steps contemplated by the
program are necessary are apt to achieve compliance with that obligation.
However, SAPN submits that they are overlapping and they are complimentary
sources of regulatory obligation.
(Emphasis added).
in response to the Tribunal’ s question whether there was only one means
of compliance with the Obligations, counsel
for SAPN replied (at Transcript, p
Absolutely not. I agree with that and I’m
indeterminate
reference. These obligations.
It’s not suggested that
there was only means to comply with them.
What is suggested, for reasons
I’ve indicated already and will return to, is that when you look at the
very modest aspects of
this program now pressed – when you look at key
findings of the VBRC, the PBST and the Jacobs report – these are
straightforwardly
linked to fire. They are aspects, in respect of which SAPN is
lagging behind good electricity industry practice. And they are standard
utterly non-gold plated pieces of infrastructure that will actually be used to
supply that defect.
(Emphasis added).
for the AER expressed surprise at that response (Transcript, pp
And the question was to the effect was there only one
method of compliance with the safety obligations. And I had understood my
friend to answer that to say it’s not being suggested that
there’s only one manner of compliance. That presents a difficulty,
seems to me, for the argument – I must say even replying to the argument
presents a difficulty – because we had been
proceeding on a certain
understanding of the argument and the error. And, certainly, the biggest error
being this is mandatory.
That was the matter put to the AER and the tribunal
will see in the reasons why that matter was addressed by the AER because of
way it was put. But there is a little bit of uncertainty there but I just flag
that at the beginning.
complete this dialogue, counsel for SAPN responded (Transcript, pp
My learned friend suggested that I had made a
concession that were many ways of complying with an obligation, and this was not
only way. My submission was, and it is SAPNs position that, the obligations
in question are obviously indeterminate in content.
There may be multiple ways
of complying with them. The Jacobs report identified multiple proposed steps to
comply with those obligations.
What we contend is that what is now before the
tribunal is the bare minimum necessary to comply with the obligations imposed by
and clause 5.2.1(a), and it’s important to recall
that those obligations in that order have cascading levels of specificity.
is very broad.
is slightly narrower. 5.2.1(a), in
speaking of good electricity industry practice, is directly addressing the kind
of topic that
is before the tribunal.
Tribunal has taken some time over this dialogue because it goes to the heart of
the approach in construing cl 6.5.7(a) and cl
6.5.7(c). It also again
highlights some of AER’s concerns in responding to SAPN’s
submissions, given its original pleading.
is uncontroversial that forecast capex must comply with both the capex
objectives and capex criteria. Here the focus of attention
on the capex
objectives is whether the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program is required to
comply with a regulatory obligation or requirement
or in the alternative is
required to maintain the safety of the distribution system.
the passage reproduced above, counsel for SAPN suggests that what is now before
the Tribunal (which we take to mean the capex sought
as part of the Bushfire
Mitigation Capex Program) is the minimum required to comply with the
Obligations. Of course at one level
that is incorrect. There is nothing in the
statutory provisions underpinning the Obligations that expressly mandate any
actions or any specific level of expenditure. Counsel for SAPN all but
acknowledged that. The expenditure proposed by SAPN is not
required to comply
with those statutory obligations, in the sense that those statutory provisions
mandate them.
as the other passages suggest, SAPN’s real contention is that the three
distinct but overlapping legislative obligations
require it to undertake the
expenditure. As already indicated those legislative obligations do not mandate
any particular actions
or any particular expenditure. As SAPN quite rightly
noted, those statutory obligations describe categories of indeterminate
which may be satisfied by conduct of various kinds. Therefore it is
unsurprising that counsel for SAPN agreed (in the passage quoted)
that there may
be many means of discharging them. This is because they impose what may for
convenience be referred to as reasonableness
obligations.
the heart of the issue then is the question of what should be the approach to
the capex objectives where (as here) the regulatory
obligation or requirement
does not import specific obligations but rather reasonableness obligations which
may be complied with in
its submissions the AER contrasted two types of regulatory obligation. One type
of regulatory obligation may be highly specific:
for example, a regulation may
require specific assets to be deployed in the electricity network. In those
circumstances, a DNSP
will not have any choice as to the assets to be deployed.
In those circumstances, the AER’s task under cl 6.5.7(c) is more
It must still assess any proposed capex by reference to the capex criteria, but
the assessment would start from the position
that the deployment of the assets
is necessary and the assessment is confined to the efficient and realistic costs
of deployment.
second is an obligation stated as a general principle, where there may be
various means of compliance with the obligation. The
Obligations that SAPN
relies on are said to be of that kind – they are, in substance,
reasonableness obligations. A DNSP may
choose or propose a particular means of
complying with such an obligation. The task of the AER is to assess the
DNSP’s proposal
in accordance with the capex criteria.
The nature of regulatory obligations
order to address SAPN’s arguments it is useful to make some observations
on the approach to assessing different types of
regulatory obligation under the
capex objectives and capex criteria.
the Tribunal’s view it is first necessary to clearly identify the
regulatory obligation or requirement associated with the
provision of standard
control service. There must be a real, direct and tangible connection –
one that is not remote.
it is necessary to determine the character of the regulatory obligation or
requirement to determine its scope, what it seeks
to address and what it
demands. There are likely to be at least three types of regulatory obligation,
each having different characteristics,
which the Tribunal discusses below.
it is necessary to examine whether the proposed capex has a direct connection in
responding to the regulatory obligation or
requirement, having regard to its
identified character, scope and requirements.
it is necessary to assess whether the forecast capex satisfies the capex
criteria in the discharge of the regulatory obligations
or requirements, as
those obligations or requirements have been characterised under the second and
third steps.
the Tribunal’s view there are arguably at least three types of regulatory
obligation or requirement to which this approach
may be applied. The first is
one that imposes an express and specific direction, such that there is only one
means of compliance,
with fixed and determined costs. A second type of
regulatory obligation is one that imposes a specific obligation, but does not
specify the means of compliance so that costs will vary with the method of
compliance employed. A third type is one that adopts
a principled approach
– specifying only overarching outcomes that must be achieved, leaving
considerable discretion as to the
approach adopted.
in the case of the first type of obligation, compliance with all the above steps
must still be demonstrated. The express nature
of the obligation does not of
itself exempt it from consideration under the capex criteria. However in
practice, satisfaction of
the capex criteria is likely to follow relatively
easily. This is because, for instance it would not be prudent to disregard an
express regulatory obligation risking breach of that obligation with the
consequences that may follow from that breach. Similar
considerations apply to
the assessment under the efficiency limb of the capex criteria.
the most part the approach to the second and third types can be taken together.
The Tribunal considers that the Obligations relied
on by SAPN are of the third
kind because the legislation underpinning them adopts a principled approach
– broadly to take reasonable
steps concerning safety.
Tribunal is not suggesting it is necessary to classify obligations in this way.
It employs that approach here merely as a convenient
analytical framework
against which to examine the competing arguments of the parties.
third type of principled obligation raises some obvious difficulties in applying
cl 6.5.7. First, if the regulatory obligation
does not specify what
specifically is to be done, then how does one determine that an action taken is
directly attributable to the
discharge of that obligation? Secondly, as there
are many means of compliance, what factors ought to be considered in determining
a suitable mix of measures that ensures compliance? That takes on some
importance because different measures will invariably involve
different costs.
Third, what are the “model” measures and corresponding costs against
which the capex criteria, particularly
prudency and efficiency, are to be
assessed when there is nothing expressly mandated?
is correct, if unhelpful in practice, simply to suggest that the answer to these
questions is to consider the capex objectives
and capex criteria within their
terms. Ultimately of course that is what must occur as it is necessary to
comply with both. However
it is difficult to arrive at an answer – at
least at the outset of one’s consideration – by simply employing
approach. This is because principled regulation carries with it the
difficulties to which we have alluded.
the case of principled regulation there is invariably some overlap between the
capex objectives and capex criteria. For instance,
whether the capex objectives
have been discharged raises considerations such as what steps have been taken by
other DNSP’s,
what is generally accepted in the industry, what
alternatives are available, what has occurred in other jurisdictions and the
These questions also go to the issue of what is prudent and efficient
under the capex criteria. There is some fluidity between
the capex objectives
on the one hand and the capex criteria on the other, even though they are
separate features of cl 6.5.7 of the
counsel for the AER said, the test for determining whether the capex objectives
have been satisfied have components of prudency
and efficiency built into them,
even though those expressions expressly appear only under the capex criteria
(Transcript, p 231):
On page 82, in the second full paragraph down
there’s a reference to the AER assessing the applicant’s revised
Mitigation Program in two steps: (1), we assessed SA Power
Network’s compliance with its safety related obligations and its
to manage bushfire risk. And (2), we assessed the prudency and efficiency of
the three projects.
It’s tempting to put a label on paragraphs 1 and 2, labelling paragraph
1, 6.5.7(a) decision, the regulatory obligation decision,
and labelling 6.5.7(c)
the capex criteria decision. And plainly those two points do go to some extent
can be divided in that way.
The point I wanted to emphasise to the tribunal and
the tribunal said, as it plays out in the reasons, one can’t completely
divorce those two steps, and I don’t want to completely divorce those two
steps. And one of the critical reasons one can’t
separate the two steps
is the regulatory obligations that we’re dealing with all have notions of
reasonableness and prudence
built into them.
So that when the AER comes to consider in what way or to what extent is this
asset replacement program required – is a regulatory
obligation or
required, it’s looking at a question of prudency and reasonableness. If
one is applying the same question under
the capex criteria, one is applying the
same sort of questions.
That’s not to say there aren’t still two
questions, but it is to say that some of the considerations that will take into
account in dealing with each aspect are very similar because of the nature of
the regulatory obligations that you’re dealing
So there can be
questions does this point, which we will come to in a moment, go to defining the
regulatory obligation or does it
go to the capex criteria? It may well go to
both, and quite appropriately go to both.
(Emphasis added).
the capex objectives and the capex criteria involve two separate and distinct
considerations, the Tribunal agrees with the
AER that in the case at least of
principled regulation (under consideration here) it is not possible in practice
to completely separate
those two steps for the reasons mentioned above. More
precisely, some of the features underpinning the capex criteria, particularly
prudency and efficiency, may also be relevant in determining whether the capex
objectives have been discharged because they emerge
naturally in considering
principled obligations.
is with these observations that the Tribunal now turns to consider SAPN’s
primary challenge.
indicated, it is undisputed that the AER approached the task in two steps. It
first assessed SAPN’s compliance with its
safety related obligations, and
its ability to manage bushfire risk. Secondly it assessed the prudency and
efficiency of the Bushfire
Mitigation Capex Program.
indicated, SAPN argued that that AER should have assessed whether the proposed
Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program was required to
comply with a regulatory
obligation or requirement or alternatively, was required to maintain the safety
of the distribution system.
Having done that, SAPN argues that the AER was then
required to be satisfied that the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program met the
capex criteria.
in SAPN’s submission is that the AER has failed to assess whether the
proposed Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program was
required to comply with a
regulatory obligation or requirement. That the AER’s assessment of
SAPN’s compliance with
its safety related obligations, and its ability to
manage bushfire risk is not a substitute for undertaking this assessment which
is required by cl 6.5.7(a)(2).
Tribunal agrees with SAPN that the AER is required by cl 6.5.7(a) to assess
whether the proposed capex is required to comply with
a regulatory obligation or
requirement. However it rejects SAPN’s argument that the AER failed to do
the AER’s summary of its findings and conclusions on capex (Final
Decision, Attachment 6, Table 6.2) there are a number of
references to
compliance with regulatory obligations and the capex criteria, including
prudency and efficiency. Immediately following
this summary the AER said (Final
Decision, Attachment 6, pp 6-11):
We consider that overall our capex forecast addresses
the revenue and pricing principles. In particular, we consider our overall
capex forecast provides SA Power Networks a reasonable opportunity to recover at
least the efficient costs it incurs in:
providing direct control network services, and
complying with
its regulatory obligations and
requirements
As set out in appendix B we are satisfied that our
overall capex forecast is consistent with the NEO. We consider our decision
efficient investment in, and efficient operation and use of,
electricity services for the long term interests of consumers of
electricity.
We also consider that overall our capex forecast addresses the capital
expenditure objectives. In making our final decision, we specifically
considered the impact our decision will have on the safety and reliability of SA
Power Networks’ network. We consider this
capex forecast should be
sufficient for a prudent and efficient service provider in SA Power
Networks’ circumstances to be
able to maintain the safety, service
quality, security and reliability of its network consistent with its current
obligations.
(Emphasis added).
in describing its approach, the AER also alludes to compliance with regulatory
obligations or requirements, in addition to
the capex criteria (Final Decision,
Attachment 6, pp 12-13).
Specifically
in considering the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program the AER also said (Final
Decision, Attachment 6, p 81):
We are not satisfied that the additional capex for
the proposed bushfire mitigation program is efficient additional capex that a
operator would require to maintain the reliability and safety of the
network, or to comply with
regulatory obligations or requirements
(Emphasis added).
passage suggests the AER was aware of the need to ensure the proposed capex was
necessary to comply with a regulatory obligation
or requirement. In the summary
which followed (at p 82) the AER referred to a number of obligations arising
Electricity Act
and the WHS Act. These provisions are considered in
some detail by the AER in the pages which followed under the heading “SA
Power Networks’ regulatory obligations and requirements”. Leaving
aside SAPN’s challenge to the AER’s construction
of these provisions
(discussed later in these Reasons for Determination), these are relevantly the
regulatory obligations contended
by SAPN. The fact that they have been
considered in this manner, suggests the AER was mindful of the need to assess
compliance with
a regulatory obligation or requirement.
is true that some of the passages quoted by the Tribunal and others that appear
in the Final Decision clearly show that the AER
was very much focused on the
safety related obligations as well as the tests of prudency and efficiency.
That is, in many respects
they appear to run together. To the extent that they
do, the Tribunal is satisfied from having considered the context, they arise
a natural consequence of considering principled regulation of this type as
explained in our earlier observations. Namely that
the issues of prudency and
efficiency arise naturally from this type of regulation. In the
Tribunals’ view that does not demonstrate
the errors contented by SAPN.
reaching this view the Tribunal is also mindful of the following comments of a
differently constituted Tribunal in
Application by EnergyAustralia and
[2009] ACompT 8
EnergyAustralia
The Tribunal is mindful that in considering the
reasons of the AER, it is important to recall that the reasons are there to
and are not to be scrutinised in a over-zealous way seeking to discern
error from the way in which the reasons are expressed: see
eg Minister for
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang
(1996) 185 CLR 259
, 272. It is
all a matter of degree, as an obvious inadequacy of the reasons may amount in
any given case to an error in the process
of fact finding or the exercise of a
discretion. The Tribunal refers to its comments in the Application by
EnergyAustralia
(2009) ACompT 7
Final Decision is a substantial document intended to explain the AER’s
reasons to a wide audience comprising many different
stakeholders. As the
Tribunal indicated in
EnergyAustralia
, the Final Decision should not be
approached in an overly rigid way.
Change in the nature of the regulatory obligations and
requirements over time
related challenge is that the AER was in error in construing cl 6.5.7(a)(2) of
the NER in such a way that it is enlivened only where
there is an express
amendment to the regulatory obligations or requirements applicable to SAPN.
That is, the AER failed to have
regard to whether the objective content of the
Obligations had changed, where there was no statutory amendment. Accordingly,
asserts that the AER failed to properly identify the regulatory obligations
and requirements that applied to SAPN and did not assess
the Bushfire Mitigation
Capex Program in accordance with the capex objectives.
particular, SAPN argues that the AER was in error by determining that the
content of the Obligations was not altered by, among
other things:
the findings of
the Victorian Bushfire Royal Commission (‘
Powerline Bushfire Safety Taskforce (‘
’) concerning the
ignition risks associated with the operation of reclosers and ageing
infrastructure assets in BFRAs and the
steps which can and should be taken to
minimise those ignition risks;
electricity industry practice” as defined Chapter 10 of the NER; and
improvements in
knowledge and technology and authoritative expert opinion.
AER disagrees that it approached its decision in that manner.
indicated, the AER agrees with SAPN’s submission that the Obligations are
indeterminate in scope and may be satisfied by
conduct of various kinds.
SAPN and the AER refer to the following passage in the Final Decision in support
of their respective positions (Attachment 6,
In the preliminary decision, we acknowledged SA Power
Networks’ initiatives to date in reviewing its current practices and
for bushfire risk management following the release of the
recommendations of the VBRC and the strategies proposed by the PBST. However
noted that there had not been a change to its regulatory obligations and safety
standards related to bushfire risk that would
justify additional expenditure.
We also noted that the evidence before us indicated that it was compliant with
its existing obligations.
SAPN, the reference to there being no “change” in the relevant
obligations and safety standards is evidence that the
AER only considered
whether there had been a change in the regulations, and not whether the content
of those obligations had been
influenced by other events. Conversely, the AER
relies on this passage to suggest that SAPN has mischaracterised its approach
including because the AER’s focus on there being no change to
regulatory obligations was to direct attention to whether the
expenditure was justified.
with the comments in
EnergyAustralia
above, the Tribunal does not
approach this task by reading the Final Decision in an overly rigid way. It is
also not prepared to
determine this question merely by construing this single
passage as if it were legislation. It is necessary to look at the Final
Decision in its totality.
substantive discussion of the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program commences at
paragraph B.5 of Attachment 6 of the Final Decision.
Shortly into this
paragraph the AER said (at pp 81-2):
We are not satisfied that the additional capex for
the proposed bushfire mitigation program is efficient additional capex that a
operator would require to maintain the reliability and safety of the
network, or to comply with regulatory obligations or requirements.
As such, we
do not accept SA Power Networks’ capex proposal to spend $38.9 million on
its bushfire mitigation program. We
find that SA Power Networks’ revised
regulatory proposal, and our alternative estimate, already factor in a
sufficient level
of capex related to its business-as-usual bushfire risk
management.
As we noted in the preliminary decision, the evidence before us indicates
that SA Power Networks is meeting its existing obligations,
and historically,
its bushfire risk management has been effective. The Office of the Technical
Regulator has confirmed that SA Power
Networks currently satisfies existing
regulations and standards relating to managing
reference in this passage to SAPN meeting “its existing obligations, and
historically, its bushfire risk management has
been effective” is
suggestive of two messages. One, as SAPN contends, is that the AER did not
consider how existing obligations
may have changed as a result of changing
circumstances, outside of any legislative change. However it is equally
consistent with
the AER’s view that the words import existing statutory
obligations as well as what those obligations require in light of any
circumstances or events.
the summary of its decision the AER refers to the legislative provisions which
underpin the Obligations and the practice of Victorian
networks, among other
things (Final Decision, Attachment 6, pp 82-3). The AER expressly acknowledged
SAPN’s initiatives in
reviewing its current practices for bushfire risk
management, following the release of the recommendations of the VBRC and the
proposed by the PBST. In the Preliminary Decision the AER also
considered a number of reports that bear on this topic and the actions
Victoria in response to the VBRC.
presenting its summary in the Final Decision, the AER then referred to the
Obligations and SAPN’s contention that the
Obligations are informed by
factors which include the findings of the VBRC and the PBST. Then in
considering SAPN’s express
legislative obligations the AER said (Final
Decision, Attachment 6, p 86):
On the information before us, we do not consider that
SA Power Network’ current bushfire mitigation practices or expenditures
are inadequate to meet its obligations under
Section 60(1)
Electricity
Rather, the evidence before us indicates that SA Power Networks is meeting
its existing regulatory and safety obligations.
As we have noted, the Office of the Technical Regulator in South Australia
has advised that SA Power Networks is meeting its current
obligations.
reference to SAPN meeting its “existing” regulatory obligations must
be viewed in the context that what was under
consideration here was the
regulatory obligations under the
Electricity Act
and other relevant obligations.
Although resorted to by SAPN in support of its position, it can equally be
viewed as a short form
reference to the fact that SAPN’s obligations were
being assessed in the timeframe in which the Final Decision was being made,
at another time. That is, currency in this context does not necessarily carry
with it the criticism advanced by SAPN that the
AER failed to consider how the
character of that obligation may change over time.
AER also separately considered the obligations under the WHS Act. In
considering the WHS Act the AER said (Final Decision, Attachment
We do not consider that SA Power Networks’
current obligations under the WHS Act justify the additional expenditure sought
the bushfire mitigation program. ...
The Energy Users Association of Australia (EUAA) submitted that, to its
knowledge, the WHS Act has not been amended recently and does
not contain any
new obligations in relation to SA Power Networks management of risk. We agree
with the EUAA. On the information
before us, we do not consider that SA Power
Networks is currently unable to meet its obligations under the WHS Act or that
its obligations
have changed such that additional capex is required to meet
passage also contains the expression “current” – presumably
carrying with it the same defect in construction
advanced by SAPN.
Additionally,
to the specific passages to which the Tribunal has referred, the AER also
undertook an extensive analysis of the level
of bushfire risks in South
Australia, Victoria and in other parts of the country, concluding (Final
Decision, Attachment 6, p 94):
As we noted above, the evidence before us indicates
that SA Power Networks is meeting its obligations under the
Electricity Act
Power Networks has explained that it has a comprehensive and mature Bushfire
Risk Management System (BRMS). This system has
been in place since the early
1980s after investigations into the impacts of the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires in
South Australia, and
has been progressively improved since.
In this section, we explain that we do not consider SA Power Networks has
provided sufficient evidence that demonstrates its fire
start risk has
AER compared for example the measures taken in Victoria following the VBRC and
the conditions in South Australia to determine
whether the same measures ought
to be employed in South Australia. Much as it did in the Preliminary Decision,
the AER examined
a number of reports as part of its analysis. The AER also
examined information on fire-starts and differences in network design.
so with the stated aim of determining whether the Bushfire Mitigation Capex
Program was consistent with good electricity
industry practice under cl 5.2.1(a)
of the NER but also with obligations flowing from the WHS Act.
nature and extent of the analysis undertaken by the AER is significant, not just
for the conclusions the AER draws from it (much
of it challenged by SAPN) but
also for what it reveals about the analysis which the AER considered it was
required to undertake.
In particular the degree of analysis undertaken on fire
conditions in Victoria and South Australia flows directly from the need
assess whether measures taken in Victoria after the VBRC ought to be applied in
South Australia. The AER addressed these issues
despite the fact that the Final
Report of the VBRC was delivered many years earlier in 2010 (and the report of
the PBST in 2011).
It is suggestive that the AER considered it was required to
assess not only whether there had been a regulatory change but also
events, outside of regulatory changes (like the outcomes of the VBRC) should be
approached in assessing SAPN’s Bushfire
Mitigation Capex Program. The
fact that the AER took this approach lends a deal of credibility to the
AER’s view that it was
mindful of the correct approach to construction of
the Obligations.
considered the Final Decision as a whole and for the reasons given above, the
Tribunal is satisfied that the AER did not disregard
the full impact of other
events and circumstances on SAPN’s obligations.
The VBRC, the PBST and the Jacobs report
also considers the AER was in error in failing to consider whether the
Obligations were altered by the findings of the VBRC and
the PBST or
alternatively gave insufficient weight to the evidence advanced by SAPN from the
VBRC and PBST. This is part of SAPN’s
overall criticism of the
AER’s approach in determining whether the capex was required by a
regulatory obligation or requirement.
Tribunal has effectively addressed the first part of this criticism in its
consideration of the overall construction point above.
The numerous passages
the Tribunal referred to in considering that point leaves no doubt that the AER
considered the findings of
the VBRC and PBST and dealt with them extensively.
It is unnecessary to address them again. That part of SAPN’s argument
second part of SAPN’s criticism is that the AER gave insufficient weight
to the findings of the VBRC and PBST.
Accompanying
its proposal to the AER, SAPN provided a report prepared by Jacobs: Recommended
Bushfire Risk Reduction Strategies for
SA Power Networks, Final Report October
2014. Jacobs considered current research, the VBRC and PBST reports, as well as
risk management initiatives undertaken by DNSPs in other Australian
considered it prudent for SAPN to implement additional risk mitigation
strategies for the following reasons (at p 33):
The VBRC found that the events of Black Saturday called
for “material reduction in the risk of bushfire caused by the failure
electrical assets”. A similar expectation is likely to apply within South
The subsequent PLBSTF identified a range of initiatives to reduce the
likelihood of powerlines starting bushfires. Some of these
are applicable to
the distribution network in South Australia and are likely to now be considered
as good industry practice within
Australia; and
General community expectation is that bushfire starts from electricity
network assets are preventable by the network owner. Litigation
against network
owners has arisen from numerous bushfire events in Victoria and Western
Australia in recent years.
then provided a detailed strategy analysis, recommending a number of measures
SAPN should implement and the costs attributable
to them (see pp 34-7).
argues that the AER should have accepted the findings of these reports, as they
strongly support a conclusion that the Bushfire
Mitigation Capex Program is a
regulatory obligation or requirement. Instead the AER sought to distinguish
between the requirements
of Victorian DNSPs and SAPN, by suggesting that the
findings made by the VBRC and PBST in relation to Victoria are not directly
to South Australia, because of greater overall areas of bushfire risk
in Victoria, differences in network construction, and the statutory
SAPN (not Victoria) to cut off power in high bushfire risk situations. In any
event, SAPN argues that the evidence does
not support the AER’s
also suggests that its proposal for the replacement of reclosers is more
targeted than that suggested by the PBST. Additionally
the fact it has adopted
a number of network construction approaches which minimise the ignition risks
associated with the operation
of a distribution system in a BFRA does not mean
it should ignore the demonstrated risks associated with the use of manual
RAGs and CLAHs in HBFRAs.
is critical of a number of subsidiary points relied on by the AER for
distinguishing between the position in Victoria and South
SAPN’s criticism that the AER did not give adequate weight to the findings
of the VBRC and PBST, is addressed below,
as part of the Tribunal’s
consideration of those subsidiary points. However before doing so it is
important to make a few
comments in response to SAPN’s primary submission
that these reports, particularly the Jacob’s recommendations, should
been adopted by the AER, almost as a matter of course.
VBRC was asked to inquire into and report on the causes and circumstances of the
fires that burned in January-February 2009, the
preparation and planning before
the fires, all aspects of the response to the fires, measures taken in relation
to utilities and
any other matters it considered appropriate. It made 67
recommendations for reform covering areas including emergency and incident
management, planning and building, land and fuel management and –
relevantly to this matter – eight recommendations applying
to electricity
caused fire.
is the nature of a Royal Commission, its task is to inquire, report and make
recommendations. Ultimately it is for government
to decide whether to adopt
those recommendations, to determine how they should be adopted and the timelines
by which that should
occur. The fact that a Royal Commission makes a
recommendation does not of itself mean that it will be adopted. Of course, its
recommendations also have no binding effect until they are implemented, usually
through legislative measures. No greater weight
can be placed on the
recommendations of a Royal Commission. The Tribunal is aware that some of the
recommendations of the VBRC have
been implemented while others are ongoing.
PBST was established to recommend to the Victorian Government how two
electricity-related recommendations of the VBRC –
recommendation 27
(progressive replacement of 22kV and SWER powerlines) and recommendation 32
(disabling or adjustment of powerline
reclose functions) should be implemented.
relation to recommendation 27, the PBST provided the following guidance (p
Electricity distributors implement the 2009 Victorian
Bushfires Royal Commission’s recommendation 27
(a) installing new generation protection
devices to instantaneously detect and turn off power at a fault on high fire

replacement should also be built with underground or insulated
PBST’s recommendation provides for several means of compliance with
implementation packages ranging in cost as indicated
recommendation.
relation to recommendation 32, the PBST recommended that Electricity
distributors adjust the protection systems for 22kV and SWER
powerlines based on
the severity of the day and the fire loss consequence of the area, as further
described in that recommendation.
The PBST made other recommendations to
support this proposal. The Victorian Government embarked on an implementation
response to the PBST recommendations.
indicated, the VBRC and PBST made several recommendations in relation to the
issues experienced in Victoria. As important as those
recommendations may be,
they have no force of themselves. It was the decision of the Victorian
Government to implement them in that
State in response to the VBRC which it
established. This is the context in which the recommendations came to have a
life in Victoria.
The Tribunal therefore rejects SAPN’s suggestion that
the AER ought to have adopted the findings and recommendations of the
PBST in the absence of them being given any express regulatory recognition in
South Australia.
criticism is that even if they did not apply as a matter of statutory force, the
AER was obliged to consider their application
in South Australia as bearing on
the Obligations. However as the Tribunal has already noted, the AER did
consider the VBRC and the
PBST extensively in its Final Decision.
Distinguishing the findings in Victoria
way in which the AER considered these reports is also challenged by SAPN.
Specifically the AER’s approach in distinguishing
the findings in Victoria
because of greater overall areas of bushfire risk in Victoria, differences in
network construction, and
the statutory ability of SAPN (not Victoria) to cut
off power in high bushfire risk situations.
maintains that the AER wrongly focused upon a comparison of the overall area of
bushfire risk throughout Victoria and South Australia,
when the only relevant
comparison should be between HBFRAs in South Australia and Victoria. That is
because SAPN’s Bushfire
Mitigation Capex Program recommends installation
of SCADA reclosers and surge arrestors specifically in HBFRAs within South
where SAPN’s distribution system operates. SAPN maintains that
where the VBRC and PBST made recommendations relating to HBFRAs
in Victoria,
those recommendations properly inform bushfire assessment in HBFRAs in South
argues it is not necessary that the underlying bushfire conditions or the
network infrastructure be identical for the recommendations
properly to inform a
bushfire mitigation program in South Australia. The AER’s conclusion that
overall there are more areas
of high bushfire risk in Victoria than South
Australia is said not to be on point.
is undisputed that the AER examined closely the difference in bushfire risk
levels in Victoria and South Australia and the differences
construction between Victoria and South Australia. Indeed it is that review of
which SAPN is critical.
AER asserts that the question whether certain recommendations made by the VBRC
and the PBST should be considered to now constitute
a mandatory safety
obligation in South Australia, or whether they have now become good electricity
industry practice, is a matter
that is informed by a comparison of the
geographic conditions, and consequential bushfire risk, as between the Victorian
rural network
areas and the rural parts of SAPN’s network area.
AER also maintains that local geographic and network conditions is relevant in
considering any interregional translation of “reasonable
under the following definition of good electricity industry practice under the
NER (Ch 10):
The exercise of that degree of skill, diligence,
prudence and foresight that reasonably would be expected from a significant
of operators of facilities forming part of the power system for the
generation, transmission or supply of electricity under conditions
comparable to
those applicable to the relevant facility consistent with applicable regulatory
instruments, reliability, safety and
environmental protection. The
determination of comparable conditions is to take into account factors such as
the relative size,
duty, age and technological status of the relevant facility
and the applicable regulatory instruments.
is said to be equally relevant to the application of
Electricity
and s 19 of the WHS Act.
the Final Decision the AER examined in detail a number of matters including
fire-start data and vegetation, fire intensity and
fire risk maps in concluding
that SAPN faced a lower bushfire risk than its Victorian counterparts. The AER
maintains that a comparison
of the fire risk areas reveal a clear difference of
degree in vegetation density, fire intensity and bushfire risk between the South
Australian HBFRAs and the highest-risk areas in Victoria. That comparison is
said to be relevant to any assessment of whether the
bushfire mitigation
measures recommended in Victoria should be adopted in South Australia and the
costs associated with their implementation
in South Australia.
the Tribunal’s view it was open to the AER to consider the geographical,
environmental and other differences in forming a
view whether the
recommendations of the VBRC applied in South Australia and how they might be
applied. Once the automatic application
in South Australia of the
recommendations of the VBRC and PBST is rejected – as the Tribunal has
indicated above ought to be
the position – the issue of whether those
measures constitute obligations or good electricity practice in South Australia
stand or fall on a full and proper consideration of the conditions and
circumstances in South Australia compared to those in Victoria.
Tribunal sees no objective reason why, in that circumstance, the AER ought to
have excluded from its consideration geographical,
environmental and other
factors that bear on the bushfire risk levels in South Australia. Indeed a full
and objective assessment
required it to do so. Having embarked on that course,
the AER undertook a comprehensive analysis spanning several pages of the Final
Decision and drawing on several reports and published data. There can be no
criticism that it gave insufficient attention to the
factors which the Tribunal
has indicated were open to it to consider. The Tribunal therefore rejects this
plank of SAPN’s
Additional matters supporting a regulatory obligation or
requirement
also argues that the AER was in error in relying on three additional matters in
support of its determination that the Obligations
did not require SAPN to
undertake the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program. Those matters are:
ability to turn-off power supply to appropriately manage bushfire risks;
the absence of
an increase in fire danger caused by electrical assets due to forecast climactic
conditions; and
historically improving fire-start performance.
three matters also go to the heart of the issue whether the Bushfire Mitigation
Capex Program satisfied the capex criteria. It
is convenient to deal with the
capex criteria later in these Reasons for Determination.
first of these factors (the ability to turn off the power supply) was also
relevant to the AER’s consideration of the application
of the VBRC and
PBST in South Australia.
the Tribunal has already indicated, it was open to the AER to consider all
relevant factors in determining whether those reports
applied on South
Australia. The ability to turn off the power supply was one such factor.
Accordingly there was no error in the
AER having considered it. That is
sufficient in itself to dispose of SAPN’s criticism of AER’s
reliance on this factor.
Nevertheless the Tribunal makes some brief comments on
it below as SAPN’s concerns extend also to the manner in which this
was taken into account by the AER.
The ability to turn off the power supply
Electricity Act
provides the capacity to switch off supply in the
following terms:
(1) An electricity entity may, without incurring any
liability, cut off the supply of electricity to any region, area, land or place
if it is, in the entity’s opinion, necessary to do so to avert danger to
person or property.
provides that if an electricity entity proposes to cut off a supply of
electricity in order to avert danger of a bush fire, the entity
practicable, consult with the Chief Officer of the South Australian Country Fire
Service before doing so.
AER determined that as SAPN is empowered to cut off the power on extreme fire
danger days, it does not necessarily follow that
the frequency of asset-caused
fires will increase correspondingly with the forecast increase in the frequency
of extreme fire danger
rejects this determination for three reasons. First, the ability to turn-off
power supply was considered in detail by the PBST,
which noted that similar
powers existed in Victoria. The fact that a similar power exists undermines any
distinction that the AER
sought to draw between SAPN and Victorian DNSPs.
Secondly, the requirement for consultation in
limits the speed within
which this could occur. Thirdly, disconnecting the power can result in a large
number of customers losing
power for approximately 7 hours, places risk on
people who rely on appliances for medical and other reasons and may undermine
reliability and security of the network in times of fire danger. These were
factors also identified by the PBST.
relied on references made by the PBST to the Electricity Distribution Code in
Victoria authorising power to be switched off.
It is unclear, at least from
that passage of the PBST, what is the source and scope of that power. In that
same passage the PBST
also referred to, but ultimately dismissed, comments made
by the Chief Fire Office that it had the power to switch off supply.
any case, the terms on which the power to switch off supply is cast is not the
only basis on which the AER relied. It was also
aware of the risks associated
with switching off power which SAPN identified. It is clear that the AER turned
its mind to some of
the consequences associated with switching off supply and
the measures in place by SAPN to manage these consequences (Final Decision,
Attachment 6, p 97):
Regarding the additional risks to the community of
turning off the power, we note that SA Power Networks has communicated to its
that they should be prepared and have plans in place to cope with a
power outage. It also advises the media and advertises regularly
warmer months. We consider SA Power Networks has taken appropriate steps to
ensure that community risks are minimised
in the event of a power
AER also noted advice from SAPN that it has an agreed set of criteria and
procedures for using its power, which has been discussed
with the Country Fire
Service and the South Australian Government.
Increase in fire danger days
argues that the AER was in error by determining that evidence provided by SAPN
did not support a conclusion that an increase
in extreme fire danger days will
lead to more fires caused by SAPN’s electricity assets.
points to evidence to the effect that over 90% of fire-starts occur in the
hottest five months of the year strongly suggests
a correlation between hotter
weather and an increased risk of fire-starts. Additionally SAPN relies on
evidence from the Bureau
of Meteorology (‘
’) and CSIRO
suggesting that the number of extreme fire danger days per year had increased by
1.7 to 2.5 times since 2000, with
that increase expected to continue. SAPN says
that the increase in hotter weather, combined with the increased potential for
fire-starts
during hotter weather, creates a clear inference that SAPN’s
infrastructure will cause more fires in future.
SAPN maintains it will be required to take additional steps to comply with the
Obligations and maintain the safety of the
distribution system. Accordingly the
AER was in error in not giving proper regard, or giving insufficient weight, to
that evidence.
should be noted that SAPN points only to a correlation between hotter weather
and an increased risk of fire-starts. Its stops
short of suggesting causality.
Similarly SAPN suggests the potential for fire-starts during hotter weather
merely creates an inference
that SAPN infrastructure will cause more fires in
future – there is no suggestion of a clear and direct correlation. Having
put its arguments no higher than that, relatively little would be required from
the AER to rebut it.
AER considered SAPN’s arguments. It noted that the overall decrease in
annual fire-starts occurred during a period when
the number of fire danger days
increased. The AER also pointed to the same data from the BoM of fire danger
days referred to by
SAPN. However the AER concluded that this evidence, in
addition to evidence of SAPN’s fire-start performance relative to
distributors indicates that SAPN is managing its current fire-start
risk appropriately (Final Decision, Attachment 6, p 98). The
Tribunal rejects
SAPN’s assertion that the issue was not considered or given insufficient
weight by the AER.
Fire-start performance
contends that the AER was in error by determining that SAPN’s historical
fire-start performance was relevant in assessing
whether the Bushfire Mitigation
Capex Program met the capex objectives and the capex criteria.
submits that the requirement to maintain the safety of the distribution system,
(particularly in the context of an increase in
extreme fire danger days and
fire-starts) requires continual improvement. It cannot be acceptable for SAPN
to determine that its
historical fire-start performance is good and therefore
that it need not take further precautionary steps.
if the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program is a regulatory obligation or
requirement, SAPN is required to undertake the Bushfire
Mitigation Capex Program
independently of any general change to SAPN’s historical fire-start
performance. In that circumstance,
SAPN’s historical fire-start
performance has no bearing on whether the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program
should have been approved
and the AER was in error by placing any weight on that
AER suggests that SAPN’s contentions are internally circular – if
SAPN’s fire-start performance has been shown
to be improving then the
regulatory obligation should not oblige SAPN to undertake the proposed capex in
the face of that improvement.
the Tribunal’s view, SAPN’s contention goes to the central feature
of its overall pleading, namely that the content
of obligations change over
time. To suggest that the requirement to maintain the safety of the
distribution system requires continuous
assessment embodies that central
concept. As the Tribunal has already noted above, it is satisfied that the AER
turned its mind
to this central contention. SAPN has not demonstrated why that
central contention should be viewed any differently in relation to
performance than any of the other factors the AER considered and why accordingly
the Tribunal should reach a different
conclusion.
Additionally
SAPN’s argument is that historical fire-start performance was relevant in
assessing whether the Bushfire Mitigation
Capex Program met both the capex
objectives and the capex criteria. Even if SAPN were able to demonstrate that
the Bushfire Mitigation
Capex Program was a regulatory obligation or requirement
that is not a complete answer to the inclusion of the proposed capex. The
proposed capex must still satisfy the capex criteria. The requirement for
“continual improvement” does not of itself
discharge that
requirement.
Construction of the
Electricity Act
and the NER
raised several arguments challenging the AER’s interpretation of
Electricity Act
and cl 5.2.1(a) of the NER.
Electricity Act
noted above,
Electricity Act
(1) A person who owns or operates electricity
infrastructure or an electrical installation must take reasonable steps to
ensure that–
(a) the infrastructure or installation
complies with, and is operated in accordance with, technical and safety
requirements imposed
under the regulations; and
(b) the infrastructure or installation is safe and safely
challenge stems from the following passage in the Final Decision where the AER
said (Final Decision, Attachment 6, p
Section 60(1)
Electricity Act
is a general
safety obligation, which we consider must be considered against the context of
other, more specific provisions of the
Electricity
contention is that the AER wrongly applied principles of statutory construction
to read down
by reference to the other specific provisions in
Electricity Act
. That is, the provisions referred to by the AER relate to
discrete aspects of bushfire safety and do not expressly address all of
matters which could fall within the broad scope of
s 60(1)(b).
Those other
specific provisions deal with insurance, compliance with the Safety,
Reliability, Maintenance and Technical Management
Plan, the capacity to turn off
power and vegetation management.
its Final Decision, the AER expressly addressed the specific provisions in the
Electricity Act
noted above (see Attachment 6, pp 85-6). It also relied on
advice it received from the Office of the Technical Regulator
’), discussed below.
consideration arose at that point in the Final Decision where the AER had noted
SAPN’s submissions in relation to its regulatory
obligations, including
the submission that
imports broad objective standards of safety (see
Attachment 6, p 84). The AER was therefore aware of SAPN’s construction.
Shortly after that – in the context of assessing whether the capex was
required by a regulatory obligation – the AER
turned to consider the
Electricity Act
provisions. It is hardly surprising that it would do
so because those provisions impose specific, identifiable obligations for
relating to insurance and licensing. The AER needed to assess whether
those specific obligations were being discharged.
considered the relevant parts of the Final Decision noted, the Tribunal
concludes that the AER did not read down the general
obligations imposed by
Electricity Act
as SAPN contends. The Tribunal is satisfied that the AER
Electricity Act
its full effect in its consideration of whether
the proposed capex was required to satisfy a regulatory obligation.
SAPN asserts that the AER erred by placing reliance on a discussion with an OTR
representative as a valid means of determining
the content of SAPN’s
obligations under the
Electricity Act
Final Decision notes advice from the OTR confirming that SAPN currently
satisfies existing regulations and standards relating
to managing bushfires.
The AER then concludes (Final Decision, Attachment 6, p 86):
As we have noted, the Office of the Technical
Regulator in South Australia has advised that SA Power Networks is meeting its
bushfire obligations. It is open for the technical regulator to review
the material provided by SA Power Networks and their consultant
determine whether formal changes to South Australian requirements are necessary.
We would consider expenditure required
to meet any new obligations either as
part of the next reset process or as part of a cost pass through application
from SA Power
conclusion follows several occasions in the Final Report where the AER relies on
its own assessment in determining the content
of SAPN’s obligations. The
Tribunal does not discern any suggestion that the AER effectively delegated the
task of assessing
the content of SAPN’s Electricity Act obligations to the
OTR. It is certainly the case (as the above passage shows) that the
consulted with and took into account advice provided by the OTR. SAPN has not
raised any argument as to why it would be improper
for the AER to do so, any
more than it would be for the AER to receive input from any other person in
making its decision.
Clause 5.2.1(a) of the NER
contends that the AER was in error by construing cl 5.2.1(a) of the NER as not
imposing any augex obligation on SAPN and in construing
the obligation as being
limited to maintenance opex and repex programs only. As noted, the provision
(a) All Registered Participants must maintain and
operate (or ensure their authorised representatives maintain and operate) all
that is part of their facilities in accordance
(1) relevant laws;
(2) the requirements of the Rules; and
(3) good electricity industry practice and relevant Australian
criticism is that the AER has placed too restrictive an interpretation on the
phrase “maintain and operate”
in this provision.
following passage in the Final Decision highlights the approach taken by the AER
(Attachment 6, pp 86-7):
We do not accept that the clause 5.2.1(a) good
electricity industry practice obligation is a regulatory obligation or
requirement
that imposes any augmentation capex obligation on a network
operator. Clause 5.2.1(a) relevantly requires that ...
That obligation specifies the standard to which a network operator must
maintain and operate the equipment that is part of its distribution
facilities. It does not impose any obligation on a network operator to augment
its existing facilities: at most, cl 5.2.1(a)
might be seen to impliedly require
a network operator to replace its existing equipment in the event that the
equipment can no longer
be maintained in accordance with good electricity
industry practice or applicable standards.
will be noted that in the above passage the AER considered that the obligation
under cl 5.2.1(a) does not extend to augmentation
of the network.
SAPN’s criticism is that the phrase “maintain and operate”,
naturally extends to replacing out-dated
infrastructure with more modern
infrastructure over time. This reading is said to be supported by the use of
the word maintain in
conjunction with “good electricity industry
practice”. SAPN maintains that the definition expressly refers to a need
for foresight in the operation of facilities, in the context of their
technological status. It also requires SAPN to consider what
would be expected
following the findings of the VBRC and the PBST that relate to bushfire safety.
is unnecessary for the Tribunal to determine the construction issue raised by
SAPN. As indicated above, the Tribunal is satisfied
that the AER did not apply
a “static” concept of safety and also adequately considered the
findings of the VBRC and PBST,
in regards to their application in South
Maintaining the safety of the distribution system under cl
6.5.7(a)(4) of the NER
the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program was not required to comply with a
regulatory obligation or requirement, SAPN’s alternative
contention is
that it is required to maintain the safety of the distribution system under cl
6.5.7(a)(4) of the NER.
says that the objective of maintaining safety is a separate and distinct
obligation to a regulatory obligation and should be
considered in light of
several matters, including AEMC’s Rule Determination: National Electricity
Amendment (Network Service
Provider Expenditure Objectives) Rule 2013
2013 Rule Determination
’) at (ii) and 19. SAPN’s
position is that whilst the AEMC considers matters of reliability and security
of supply should
be limited by relevant regulatory obligations and requirements,
safety should not. The Tribunal does not accept that construction.
AEMC’s determination arose in the context of an apparent lack of clarity
in how the NER applied to a regulatory obligation
relating for example to
safety, compared with a safety obligation arising under objectives 3 and 4. The
AEMC said in its 2013 Rule
Determination (at p 10):
The Commission considers that, under the previous
rules, it was not clear how the existing expenditure objectives worked together.
This was because expenditure objective 2 required an NSP, in developing its
regulatory proposal, to base its expenditure on complying
with regulatory
obligations or requirements for reliability, security, quality and safety. On
the other hand expenditure objectives
3 and 4 could be interpreted such that
they required this expenditure to be based on maintaining existing levels of
reliability,
security, quality and safety. This created a lack of clarity for
the NSP when putting together its regulatory proposal and for the
determining an NSP’s expenditure allowance in relation to these
In addition, the previous expenditure objectives could have been interpreted
to require the expenditure in an NSP’s regulatory
proposal to be based on
maintaining existing levels of reliability, security quality or safety, even
an NSP was performing above the required standards for
these measures, or where
the required standards for these measures were
The same issue arose when the AER determined the
expenditure allowance.
AEMC then commented that in light of this problem, complying with standards in
regulatory obligations or requirements is the appropriate
objective for these
measures. Nevertheless the AEMC did not consider it appropriate to amend the
expenditure objectives for safety.
This is because it considered that current
levels of safety may appropriately have been influenced by safety standards in
industry codes or Australian standards in addition to regulated
standards. The AEMC’s concern is that doing so could risk
inadvertently
reducing the level of safety delivered. Alternatively it could require those
existing non-regulated standards to be
moved to regulation to avoid any
unintended reduction in safety levels (2013 Rule Determination, pp 10-11).
AEMC said that where there are no regulatory obligations or requirements in
relation to reliability, security, quality or safety
then the issue of how the
existing objectives work together does not arise. That is, in the absence of
standards being set by the
previous performance (2013 Rule Determination, p 11). The Tribunal does not
the AEMC to be suggesting that expenditure on safety is in a sense
“open ended”.
also maintains that the safety obligation in cl 6.5.7(a)(4) is informed by the
VBRC, the PBS and the Jacobs report. The obligation
under cl 6.5.7(a)(4) is
nonetheless an obligation relating to safety of the distribution system and in
that sense has characteristics
in common with the safety requirements said to
arise under the Obligations.
Tribunal has already traversed the submissions of SAPN in relation the VBRC,
PBST and the Jacobs report in its consideration of
the safety issues arising as
a regulatory obligation or requirement. Therefore it is unnecessary to consider
them again here. The
Tribunal rejects SAPN’s argument.
Compliance with the capex criteria
is undisputed that the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program must also satisfy the
capex criteria.
contends that the AER was in error in concluding that the Bushfire Mitigation
Capex Program did not satisfy the capex criteria.
Specifically that the AER was
in error in finding that:
(a) a sufficient level of capex related
expenditure had already been provided for “business-as-usual bushfire risk
management”,
when there was no specific or identifiable
“business-as-usual bushfire risk management” capex allowance;
(b) SAPN was required to provide, but had not provided, a cost-benefit analysis
in respect of the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program;
(c) the driver for the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program was replacement based
on age and condition (repex) that could be addressed
using SAPN’s repex
Business as usual bushfire risk management
criticism is that the expression “business-as-usual bushfire risk
management” is not found in the NEL, the
NER, or the AER’s
guidelines. Further, the Final Decision did not specify or identify any
“business-as-usual bushfire
risk management” capex allowance.
is uncontroversial that the expression “business-as-usual bushfire risk
management” is not found in the NEL or the
expression “business-as-usual” appears in several places in the
Final Decision. One such passage on which SAPN relies
provides (Attachment 6,
We are not satisfied that the additional capex for
the proposed bushfire mitigation program is efficient additional capex that a
operator would require to maintain the reliability and safety of the
network, or to comply with regulatory obligations or requirements.
As such, we
do not accept SA Power Networks’ capex proposal to spend $38.9 million on
its bushfire mitigation program. We
find that SA Power Networks’ revised
regulatory proposal, and our alternative estimate, already factor in a
sufficient level
of capex related to its business-as-usual bushfire risk
management.
is useful to look at the other parts of the Final Decision to gain a better
understanding of what the AER intended to convey by
that expression.
addition to the passage noted above, the expression is used in several other
places. For example, it emerges in the AER’s
consideration of historic
fire-start performance. There the AER finds (Final Decision, Attachment 6, p
Evidence provided by SA Power Networks shows that it
has improved its fire-start performance to date using business-as-usual
expenditure,
and has done so during a period of increasing bushfire risk. The
evidence further supports the view that SA Power Networks does
not require
additional expenditure to meet the capex criteria.
AER also used that expression in determining whether the business-as-usual
approach to repex will provide SAPN with sufficient
capex to manage the
replacement of its assets and meet the capex objectives. Also in relation to
the installation of modern surge
arresters, the AER said that SAPN had been
given additional business-as-usual repex that addresses increased asset
replacement needs.
its context, the Tribunal finds that the expression was used by the AER to refer
to SAPN’s existing asset replacement practices
(particularly SCADA
reclosers and surge arrestors) addressed by the repex forecast. Clearly the AER
was using the expression as
a shorthand reference to this and was not suggesting
it is a requirement flowing from the NEL or NER.
this, SAPN also asserts that the AER did not specify or identify any
“business-as-usual bushfire risk management”
capex allowance. SAPN
says it has not installed SCADA reclosers and surge arrestors at end of life
using its repex budget. Only
part of the cost of replacing manual reclosers
with SCADA reclosers at end-of-life is funded through repex, namely that
of the cost equal to replacement with a modern equivalent. SAPN
therefore argues it is an error to suggest that it could fund SCADA
and surge arrestors through its repex allowance.
concern is not simply whether the repex was adequate to fund SCADA reclosers and
surge arresters. It is also that the
AER was not mindful that the Obligations
import changes in circumstances (including in relation to safety) and therefore
the “business-as-usual”
approach adopted by the AER is incapable of
responding to that construction.
Tribunal has already concluded that the AER was aware of and had regard to the
fact that the Obligations may change over time.
Once this is accepted,
business-as-usual bushfire risk management must be viewed for the shorthand
reference which we consider the
AER intended it to convey. In that context, the
AER appears to have proceeded on the basis that the business-as-usual approach
be sufficient for SAPN to meet its safety obligations (Final Decision,
Attachment 6, p 77):
We are satisfied that the business as usual approach
to repex will provide SA Power Networks with sufficient capex to manage the
replacement
of its assets and meet the capex objectives of maintaining safety,
reliability and security of the distribution system. The business
approach takes into account the service provider’s recent replacement
practices, together with information on the
age of its current stock of assets,
to estimate the replacement volumes and expenditure the service provider
business is likely to
require if it maintains its current asset replacement
practices over the next period. As noted in the Expenditure Forecast Assessment
Guideline, we consider that its replacement practices in the last period were
appropriate to allow the business to meet the capex
objectives. We consider
that adoption of the business as usual estimate approach means these asset
replacement practices will continue
to allow the businesses to meet the capex
objectives.
SAPN undoubtedly rejects the adequacy of the repex component of the total capex
forecast, the AER reached a position of satisfaction
having considered what was
necessary to discharge SAPN’s capex objectives, consistent with the
prudency and efficiency requirements
of the capex criteria. That involved the
exercise of some judgement. The Tribunal is not satisfied that the SAPN has
mounted any
arguments to suggest this judgement was not open to the
Cost-benefit analysis
contends that the AER was in error by determining that SAPN was required to
provide, and had not provided, a cost-benefit analysis
in respect of the
Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program. It is undisputed that the SAPN did not
provide a cost-benefit analysis, though
it says it provided sufficient
information to the AER to enable the AER to undertake a cost-benefit analysis.
The implication is
that if a cost-benefit analysis was indeed required, then the
AER had before it information to undertake that analysis, but failed
refers to the AER’s Explanatory Statement to the Expenditure Forecast
Assessment Guideline. The Better Regulation Guidelines
suggests a cost-benefit
analysis is typically required by the AER to demonstrate that forecast
expenditure meets the efficiency and
prudency criteria in the NER. SAPN
indicates that the Better Regulation Guidelines make clear that a cost-benefit
analysis allows
for a quantitative assessment of the overall monetary costs of
programs against their overall monetary benefits to consumers, to
which program provides the most net benefit.
position is that such a cost-benefit analysis is inappropriate where the program
relates to network safety. This is
because the cost to be considered is in
monetary terms and the benefit to be considered is not only economic, but
includes the prevention
of loss of life or serious injury. Monetary costs
cannot be quantitatively compared with loss of life and serious injury, and that
comparison necessarily requires a level of subjective or qualitative assessment.
In such a circumstance SAPN says that a strict comparison
of monetary costs and
benefits contemplated by the Guideline is not possible and should not be
Tribunal rejects that argument. It is common knowledge that courts are
regularly called on to ascribe a monetary value to life
and injury in the form
of compensation for personal injuries. As unfortunate as it may be, it is
possible to place a monetary value
on life and injury. In the context of this
matter, the capex criteria in the NER do not draw any distinction between costs
to safety or other capex costs. This suggests that safety related costs
must run exactly the same efficiency and prudency gauntlet
as any other claimed
capex. In that context the requirement for a cost-benefit analysis (such as
that specified in the Better Regulation
Guidelines) is apt.
related submission of SAPN is that the AER ought not to have required SAPN to
provide a cost-benefit analysis to demonstrate the
“as low as reasonably
practicable” risk mitigation principle. SAPN’s reasons are similar
to its objection to a
cost-benefit analysis for the Bushfire Mitigation Capex
Program in total – namely that qualitative not quantitative approaches
should be applied to loss of life and injury. The Tribunal does not accept that
argument for the same reasons given above.
Alternatively,
SAPN submits that the AER had before it evidence that allowed it to make a
qualitative assessment that the Bushfire
Mitigation Capex Program was not
grossly disproportionate to the benefit gained from the risk reduction, but
failed to consider that
AER maintains that the information SAPN provided did not endeavour to measure
the relative costs and benefits of all available
assuming the information SAPN provided the AER was sufficient to undertake a
cost-benefit analysis, SAPN has not identified any
provision of the NER or NEL
that obliges the AER to undertake such a task. It would be an unusual
regulatory regime that entitles
a DNSP to provide a “data dump” to
the regulator with the expectation that the regulator undertake its own
quantitative
analysis, as it sees fit.
Augmentation versus replacement
argues that the AER was in error by determining that the driver for the Bushfire
Mitigation Capex Program was replacement based
on age and condition (repex),
which could be addressed using SAPN’s repex allowance.
SAPN explained, the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program did not propose
replacement of assets with an “equivalent” device,
propose to replace assets which had deteriorated or reached the end of their
economic life. Rather SAPN had proposed
expenditure on newer types of assets
that it considered provided improved or safer functionality.
dealing with this issue in the Final Decision, the AER relevantly said
(Attachment 6, p 100):
In the sections above we have considered SA Power
Networks’ compliance with its regulatory obligations and its ability to
the existing and potential risks. As explained, we consider that SA
Power Networks’ proposed additional expenditure does not
reflect the capex criteria.
However, as an additional step, we have also considered whether the three
projects that form its revised bushfire mitigation program
reasonably reflect
the capex criteria at an individual project level. These proposed projects
include SCADA reclosers, surge arrestors
and metered mains. We consider these
projects below. ...
We recognise that the installation of SCADA reclosers may mitigate fire start
risks, however we consider the replacement of aging
reclosers funded through
augex does not reasonably reflect the capex criteria. We have provided funding
for the replacement of aging
reclosers in our repex allowance, and expect that
SA Power Networks will prioritise its repex program in accordance with its risk
management framework.
of SAPN’s objection emerges from the final paragraph of this passage and
the classification employed there by the AER in
dealing with SCADA reclosers.
However that paragraph must be understood in the context of the two paragraphs
which precede it.
It is clear from the first paragraph that the AER had already
considered and rejected the additional capex expenditure as not satisfying
capex criteria. The analysis which it then undertakes is what it describes as
“an additional step”.
AER had not made the determination claimed by SAPN. As the full passage
indicates, the AER took the approach of assessing whether
the proposed
expenditure met the capex criteria as required under the NER. As the Tribunal
has already found there was no error
in the AER’s approach to the capex
criteria, it is sufficient to dismiss SAPN’s submissions on this
the reasons given, the Tribunal concludes that the AER did not, in its decision
concerning the Bushfire Mitigation Capex Program,
make the errors of fact
pleaded by SAPN, incorrectly exercise its discretion or make a decision that was
unreasonable in all the
circumstances. SAPN fails on this aspect of its
application.
Forecast labour cost escalation
component of the AER’s decision concerning forecast opex under cl 6.5.6
and cl 6.12.1(4) of the NER is an annual escalator
to take account of likely
changes in prices (input costs), output and productivity during the regulatory
control period. A similar
approach is applied to forecast capex under cl 6.5.7
and cl 6.12.1(3) of the NER.
forecast price growth, the AER uses a weighted average of forecast labour price
growth and forecast non-labour price growth. The
weighting applied by the AER
in the Final Decision was 62% for labour and 38% for non-labour. The escalator
used for forecasting
non-labour price growth is CPI. This is undisputed. It is
only the labour price component that is in dispute.
its Regulatory Proposal, SAPN proposed that the AER should adopt real labour
cost escalators of:
+1.66% per annum
for 2015-16 and 2016-17, based on the nominal wage increase outcomes negotiated
by SAPN under its EA for 2014-16;
+1.77% per annum
for 2017-18 through 2019-20, being the forecasts based on the Frontier
Economics’ Wage Price Index (‘
’) for Electricity,
Gas, Water and Waste Services (‘
’) in South
indicated in its Revised Proposal that compliance with the EA is mandatory and
the EA is a “regulatory obligation or requirement”,
as described in
s 2D(b)(v) of the NEL.
its Final Decision, the AER rejected SAPN’s proposed increments, and
substituted real labour cost escalators of:
+0.45% for 2015-16 and 2016-17, respectively; and
increasing from +1.00% to +1.45% for the years 2017-18 through 2019-20 based on
the average of the EGWWS WPI forecasts provided
by Deloitte Access Economics and
BIS Shrapnel.
will be seen that the dispute relates only to the approach adopted by the AER in
relation to the first two years of the regulatory
control period.
submits that its EA is a “regulatory requirement or obligation” for
the following reasons:
the EA is an
instrument made or issued under or for the purposes of the
Fair Work Act
’), which in turn is an Act of a
participating jurisdiction (namely, the Commonwealth);
section 50 of
the FW Act requires SAPN to comply with its EA; and
materially affects the provision by SAPN of the electricity network services
that are the subject of the Final Decision.
SAPN, a consequence of this view is that:
incurred by it in complying with its EA are costs that meet the expenditure
objectives in cl 6.5.6(a)(2) and cl 6.5.7(a)(2);
proposed labour cost escalators reasonably reflect the prudent and efficient
cost of achieving the expenditure objectives;
the AER was
required to take into account the principle that SAPN should be provided with a
reasonable opportunity to recover at least
the efficient cost of complying with
the regulatory obligation created by or under the FW Act.
AER did not accept that the EA is a regulatory obligation or requirement. In
its Final Decision it said (Attachment 7, p 45):
We consider EA’s are not a ‘regulatory
obligation or requirement’ as defined in section 2D of the NEL.
The fact that the EA requires certification under the
Fair Work Act
does not make it an instrument “made or issued by or under”
that Act. Likewise, the fact that the
Fair Work Act 2009
contains provisions
regulating certain procedures by which an enterprise and its employees may make
an EA does not mean that EAs
are “made under” the Act.
Section 182
specifies than an EA is made when a majority of employees vote to approve the
agreement. It follows that an EA is made by agreement
between the enterprise
and its employees but regulated by an Act. The agreement made between parties
is not made or issued under
AER also concluded that the EA is not an instrument that “materially
affects the provision of electricity network services”
(Attachment
We also note an EA is not an instrument that
“materially affects the provision of electricity network services”
the meaning of section 2D. The EA itself has no effect on the provision
of network services. There is no necessary connection between
the terms of the
EA and the nature, quality or quantity of network services supplied by a DNSP.
An EA is not a requirement to provide
electricity network services and a DNSP
may arrange labour on many bases that do not involve an
Application of the NER
6.5.6(a) of the NER states the opex objectives in relation to DNSPs as
(a) A building block proposal must include the total
forecast operating expenditure for the relevant regulatory control period which
the Distribution Network Service Provider considers is required in order to
achieve each of the following (the operating expenditure
objectives):
(1) meet or manage the expected demand
for standard control services over that period;
(2) comply with all applicable regulatory obligations or requirements
associated with the provision of standard control services
(3) to the extent that there is no applicable regulatory obligation or
requirement in relation to:
(i) the quality, reliability
or security of supply of standard control services; or
(ii) the reliability or security of the distribution system through the
supply of standard control
to the relevant
(iii) maintain the quality,
reliability and security of supply of standard control services; and
(iv) maintain the reliability and security of the distribution system
through the supply of standard control services;
(4) maintain the safety of the
distribution system through the supply of standard control services.
(Emphasis added).
6.5.7(a) of the NER is in similar terms, in its application to capex.
6.5.6(c) prescribes the opex criteria as follows (‘
(c) The AER must accept the forecast of required
operating expenditure of a Distribution Network Service Provider that is
in a building block proposal if the AER is satisfied that the total of
the forecast operating expenditure for the regulatory control
period reasonably
reflects each of the following (the operating expenditure

operating expenditure objectives; and
(2) the costs that a prudent operator would require to achieve the operating
expenditure objectives; and
(3) a realistic expectation of the demand forecast and cost inputs required
to achieve the operating expenditure
objectives.
6.5.7(c) of the NER is in the similar terms, in its application to capex.
6.5.6(d) provides that if the AER is not satisfied as referred to in cl
6.5.6(c), it must not accept the DNSP forecast.
Areas of Dispute
contends that the AER wrongly concluded that SAPN’s EA was not a
regulatory obligation or requirement. Alternatively,
the AER wrongly concluded
that the FW Act which requires SAPN to comply with its EA, was not a regulatory
obligation or requirement
applicable to SAPN.
position is that had the AER correctly determined that compliance with
SAPN’s EA was a regulatory obligation or
requirement, it would have
followed that the escalation of SAPN’s labour costs in the first two years
of the 2015-20 regulatory
control period, in accordance with the EA, would
satisfy the expenditure criteria and therefore should have been accepted.
contention is that the AER made an error of fact or facts that was material to
the making of the decision, that the exercise
of the AER discretion was
incorrect and the decision unreasonable, having regard to all the circumstances.
its written submissions, SAPN argues in the alternative that if the EA is not a
regulatory obligation or requirement, it is required
to achieve the opex and
capex objectives, namely, the objective as articulated in cl 6.5.6(a)(4) and cl
6.5.7(a)(4) to “maintain
the safety of the distribution system through the
supply of standard control services”. Also, the EA reasonably reflects
opex and capex criteria in cl 6.5.6(c)(3) and cl 6.5.7(c)(3) as realistic
expectations of the demand forecast and costs inputs required
to achieve the
opex and capex objectives.
AER objected to SAPN raising these alternative grounds, claiming they were not
raised as a grounds of review in SAPN’s Amended
Application or in
submissions before the AER as required under s 71O(2)(a) of the NEL. The AER
maintained that objection during
oral argument. The Tribunal indicated that
ordinarily a fairly generous view is taken in cases where, as here, there is
some reference
to the grounds now advanced (albeit minimal), in submissions to
the AER during the making of its decision. SAPN did not apply to
pleading and the AER proceeded to also address these grounds.
Regulatory obligation or requirement
expression “regulatory obligation or requirement” is relevantly
defined in s 2D(1)(b)(v) of the NEL as follows:
an Act of a participating jurisdiction, or any
instrument made or issued under or for the purposes of that Act ... that
affects the provision, by a regulated network service provider, of
electricity network services that are the subject of a distribution
determination or transmission determination.
previously mentioned, a “participating jurisdiction” is a

submitted that the Commonwealth is a participating jurisdiction through the
following interrelated definitions.

a law that is in force in the Commonwealth and corresponds with Pt 2 of the NESA
Act, which provides for the operation
of the NEL and NER. Section 6 of the AEM
Act provides:

or having effect under that Law.
AER does not contest that the Commonwealth is a participating jurisdiction,
albeit that s 6 of the AEM Act appears to have been
enacted only to ensure
the application of the NEL to Australia’s offshore areas.
second limb of the definition of “regulatory obligation or
requirement” is whether the EA is an “instrument
made or issued
under or for the purposes of that Act”, relevantly the FW Act. As
noted the AER concluded that the EA is not
made under the FW Act but is rather
an agreement between the enterprise and its employees, though regulated by the
FW Act. The agreement
made between parties is not made or issued under an

will be felt also by those who did not agree to them. Someone, such as an

to share in the perception that an

must be a direct connection between the Act and instrument and the provision of
electricity network services. The direct connection
is the labour needed to
provide those services, not the mechanism (in this case the EA) that is employed
to deliver the labour.
It would equally have been open to SAPN to engage labour
through other means, for example a third party labour provider. Depending
the means chosen, the employment terms and conditions (and importantly the
accompanying costs) would be different, but with no
corresponding impact on the
provision of electricity network services. It would be an odd circumstance
where the definition is attracted
merely by the vehicle chosen to deliver that
Additionally,
the FW Act applies to all Australian companies. The EA model is open to
companies across many industries, not just
DNSPs. In that sense there is no
unique connection between the EA and the provision of electricity network
services, any more than
there is to any other industry.
other examples of regulatory obligation or requirement under s 2D also sheds
some light on the type of matters contemplated.
It is useful for this purpose
to reproduce s 2D(1):
2D – Meaning of regulatory obligation or
requirement
(1) A regulatory obligation or requirement
(a) in relation to the provision of an
electricity network service by a regulated network service
(i) a distribution system
safety duty or transmission system safety duty; or
(ii) a distribution reliability standard or transmission reliability
standard; or
(iii) a distribution service standard or transmission service standard;
(b) an obligation or requirement
(i) this Law or Rules;
(ia) the National Energy Retail Law or the National Energy Retail Rules;
(ii) an Act of a participating jurisdiction, or any instrument made or issued
under or for the purposes of that Act, that levies or
imposes a tax or other
levy that is payable by a regulated network service provider; or
(iii) an Act of a participating jurisdiction, or any instrument made or
issued under or for the purposes of that Act, that regulates
the use of land in
a participating jurisdiction by a regulated network service provider; or
(iv) an Act of a participating jurisdiction or any instrument made or issued
under or for the purposes of that Act that relates to
the protection of the
environment; or
(v) an Act of a participating jurisdiction, or any instrument made or issued
under or for the purposes of that Act (other than national
electricity
legislation or an Act of a participating jurisdiction or an Act or instrument
referred to in subparagraphs (ii) to (iv)),
that materially affects the
provision, by a regulated network service provider, of electricity network
services that are the subject
of a distribution determination or transmission
determination.
can be seen that subss 2D(1)(b)(ii)-(iv) deal with instruments which impose
levies or taxes or apply to the use of land or the
protection of the
environment. They are in the nature of instruments which the legislature has
prescribed. In contrast the EA (although
having a statutory character once
implemented as described by the Full Federal Court in
Toyota Motor
Corporation) is nevertheless within the choice of SAPN management. The decision
to pursue an EA was not “imposed” on
SAPN by s 2D in the same way
that taxes and levies for example are imposed on it under s 2D.
NEO provides:
The objective of this Law is to promote efficient
investment in, and efficient operation and use of, electricity services for the
long term interests of consumers of electricity with respect

and security of supply of electricity; and

NEO indicates that the overarching objective is to ensure the efficient
investment in and operation of electricity services for
the long-term interests
of end users. The NEO is supported, among other things, by the opex criteria
which directs attention to
whether opex costs are prudent and efficient. The
contents of an EA (at least at the point of its establishment) is something
is negotiated by SAPN management and the employees covered by the EA.
Despite the best efforts of a DNSP (like SAPN), there is the
capacity for an EA
to include terms (and corresponding costs) that are not conducive to meeting the
NEO, for example because a DNSP
needs to accede to employee demands. Ultimately
an EA is the product of negotiation and there is considerable discretion on SAPN
on the costs associated with complying with the terms of an EA. It is not
necessarily benchmarked to provide the necessary comfort
that EA costs are
efficient. The Tribunal does not accept SAPN’s submission that the
arms-length negotiation of its EA is
a substitute for benchmarking or other
appropriate means for testing its costs.
suggested that its EA is comparable to the EA considered by a separately
constituted Tribunal in
. There at [416]-[417] the Tribunal was
faced with the AER’s conclusion that the EA was not a regulatory
obligation or requirement
because it was not made under the law of a
participating jurisdiction (namely the Commonwealth). The Tribunal there was
consider whether the Minister’s intervention amounted to a
concession that the Commonwealth was a participating jurisdiction
(at [418]).
As the Tribunal made very clear, it was not necessary for it to delve further
into that question. The Tribunal did
not decide that an EA was a regulatory
obligation or requirement.
these reasons the Tribunal concluded that the FW Act and the EA made under that
Act is not a regulatory obligation or requirement
associated with the provision
of standard control services.
Maintaining the safety of the distribution
alternative argument is that even if its EA is not a regulatory obligation or
requirement, it is still necessary to maintain
the safety of the distribution
system, and falls within the opex and capex objectives in cl 6.5.6(a)(4) and cl
6.5.7(a)(4) of the

however, unnecessary to delve further into whether the Minister’s
intervention amounts to a concession on the part
of the AER.
That is because
the EBAs may be reasonably regarded as:
otherwise required to achieve an
opex objective, namely, the r 6.5.6(a)(4) objective to: “maintain the
safety of the distribution
system through the supply of standard control
services”; and

points in particular to the highlighted passage for the proposition that
decided that labour costs derived in accordance with an EA
reasonably reflects the opex and capex criteria. As explained above,
Tribunal there found it unnecessary to decide whether an EA was a regulatory
obligation. It is then that the highlighted passage
appears where the Tribunal
indicates that “the EBAs may be reasonably regarded as ... [required to
achieve the opex objective
and opex criteria]”. That conclusion is
reached from the following passage in which the Tribunal quotes from the
reasons, at [419]:

affect the Networks NSW DNSPs’ provision of standard control
We also disagree with the service
providers’ submissions that compliance with the terms of their own EBAs is
a ‘regulatory
obligation or requirement’. For example, service
providers have referred to redundancy costs ‘required to be paid as
regulatory obligation’.
... of the six possible (and exhaustive) categories of obligations or
requirements ... , EBAs could conceivably only fall with an
Act or instrument
made or issued that ‘materially affects a service provider’s
provision of electricity network services’.
This is because the terms of
an EBA could plausibly materially affect a service provider’s provision of
standard control services.
However, that Act or instrument must be made by a
‘participating jurisdiction’. Given a participating jurisdiction
must have passed a version of the NEL, an EBA made under the
Commonwealth’s Fair Work Act 2009 appears to be imposed by a law
than of a participating jurisdiction. Further, the terms of an EBA itself are
not contained in the
Fair Work Act
Tribunal’s conclusion that the EA may reasonably be regarded as satisfying
the capex objective and capex criterion, was
presumably drawn from the following
statement in the above passage:
This is because the terms of an EBA could plausibly
materially affect a service provider’s provision of standard control
that passage emerged only in the context of the AER attempting to find a
category of regulatory obligation or requirement
under s 2D to which an EA could
logically “fit”. It considered the most logical fit was with the
category dealing with
an Act or instrument that materially affects the provision
of electricity network services. The AER was not suggesting from the
passage that it had in fact concluded that an EA materially affects a service
provider’s provision of standard control
services. Rather that was the
only working category that could possibly fit within the requirements of s 2D.
Hence the AER’s
use of the expression “plausibly”.
also referred to the following passage from
in support of its
position at [436]:
It may be said that, in the view of the Tribunal,
it is the policy of the legislative arm of government that, to the extent that
EBA’s are (if they are) an inefficient imposition on the DNSPs,
nevertheless they are a cost to be borne by the consumers of
electricity.
... [H]aving regard to the regulatory prescriptions, the
Tribunal does not accept that [the AER] may, by the use of the EI model
[proposed by the AER], simply select the measurement of efficiency which it did
in this respect without regard to the obligations
under the EBAs as they
presently exist. Over time, and probably during the new current regulatory
period, any such inefficiencies
as the AER considers to exist may progressively
be reduced ... and any allowances under the EBAs (as they expire) which the AER
to be inefficient may also by the same elapse of time be reduced to an
efficient level.
(Emphasis added).
relies on the highlighted passage for the proposition that it is the policy of
the legislative arm of government to permit EAs,
almost without regard to their
cost impact.
is not what the Tribunal in
conveys by that passage. It is
important to understand the context in which it arose. The AER had relied on a
model prepared for
it by Economic Insights Pty Limited
’). What came to be known as the EI model was an
econometric benchmarking model which arose from two reports EI prepared for
AER. The model was relied on by the AER in determining the appropriate opex.
The relevant parties challenged the manner in
which the AER had applied that
model including the inputs it used.
the AER appears to have recognised that the terms of an EA can affect a
DNSP’s delivery of standard control services,
nevertheless, in applying
the EI model, the AER purportedly treated costs arising under the EAs as an
endogenous factor to be ignored
in the AER’s estimate of the total
required opex (see [421]-[423] of
). The Tribunal then said at
Thus, although the EBAs may lack either the
NEL’s s 2D jurisdictional foundation or the genus of a safety or
reliability standard
etc of a r 6.5.6(a)(3) “regulatory requirement or
obligation”, the Networks NSW DNSPs are bound by their EBAs as a matter
law. Unlike a contract, which according to its terms may be terminated, an EBA
continues in force until its nominal expiry date
after which it may, with the
approval of the Fair Work Commission, be terminated by agreement between an
employer and the employees
Fair Work Act 2009
(Cth)). Absent agreement, an application must be made to the Fair Work
Commission to terminate an EBA. Termination may only occur
if the Commission is
satisfied that to do so is not contrary to the public interest and is
appropriate in all the circumstances
Fair Work Act 2009
the opening part of this passage it said:
Thus, although the EBAs may lack either the
NEL’s s 2D jurisdictional foundation or the genus of a safety or
reliability standard
etc of a r 6.5.6(a)(3) “regulatory requirement or
obligation”, the Networks NSW DNSPs are bound by their EBAs as a matter
Tribunal is there suggesting that an EA does not attract the regulatory
obligation of s 2D or indeed the safety and reliability
standard of cl
6.5.6(a)(3). This of course also lends further support to our view that
SAPN’s EA is not a regulatory obligation.
It is then said “Networks
NSW DNSPs are bound by their EBAs as a matter of law”. Having already
rejected the application
of s 2D and cl 6.5.6(a)(3), the Tribunal must be
referring to the fact that a DNSP is bound by an EA only in the sense that a
to comply would constitute a breach and attract penalties under the FW
Act. That interpretation is supported by the remainder of
the passage where the
Tribunal discusses the limited rights to terminate an EA – reinforcing the
point that an EA is binding
on a DNSP as a matter of law.
is after this discussion that paragraph [436] of the Tribunal’s reasons
emerge on which SAPN relies. When the Tribunal refers
in that paragraph to
“the policy of the legislative arm of government that, to the extent that
the EBA’s are (if they
are) an inefficient imposition on the DNSPs,
nevertheless they are a cost to be borne by the consumers of electricity”,
is referring to the fact that an EA is binding in the sense in which they had
previously used it. That is, the Tribunal is suggesting
it could not have been
the policy intent of the legislature to permit the AER (relevantly when applying
the EI model) to ignore the
binding nature of an EA and to treat it wholly as an
endogenous factor which could be ignored by the AER. It is not suggesting that
the cost impacts of an EA should, as matter of policy expressed by the
legislature, be disregarded entirely or conversely, automatically
Accordingly
the Tribunal rejects SAPN’s reliance on this aspect of the
if our assessment of
is incorrect, SAPN’s argument that the
EA is necessary to maintain the safety of the distribution system and falls
opex and capex objectives of the NER should be rejected.
the provision still requires that SAPN demonstrate that the EA is necessary to
“maintain the safety of the distribution
system through the supply of
standard control services”. As explained in the earlier consideration of
cl 6.5.6(a)(2) and s
2D, there must be a direct connection between the EA and
the delivery of standard control services. That connection is the labour
employed to deliver those services, not the mechanism chosen to provide that
the capex and opex objectives apply to the total estimates for capex and opex.
The labour cost escalator is one such factor.
It cannot be assumed that any
error with respect to the labour cost escalator would completely undermine the
capex and opex objectives
applying to the safe delivery of standard control
Compliance with the capex criteria
SAPN’s contention that the EA is a regulatory obligation or is otherwise
necessary to maintain the safety of the distribution
system under the opex and
capex objectives is rejected, it is unnecessary to consider whether the EA
satisfies the capex criteria.
Were it necessary to do so, the Tribunal would
find that the capex criteria is not satisfied. The Tribunal sets out briefly
reasons for this view.
argues that its EA was negotiated at arm’s length in good faith and
represents current market conditions for electricity
workers in South Australia.
Its labour escalations cover almost 95% of its employees, and others (such as
contractors) are effectively
bound to the EA through a contractor parity clause
requiring the payment of EA rates of pay. SAPN also submits that the use of the
benchmark EAs is a preferable methodology than the EGWWS WPI suggested by the
AER and provides a more reasonable and transparent
forecast for the labour price
rate of change.
should be noted that the labour cost escalator is applied to a broader category
of costs than simply internal labour. To forecast
price growth, the AER uses a
weighted average of forecast labour price growth and forecast non-labour price
growth. The implications
therefore extend beyond SAPN’s EA issues
EA must satisfy the prudency and efficiency tests under the opex and capex
criteria. The mere negotiation of an EA, albeit in
good faith and at
arm’s length, is not itself an adequate foundation for discharging the
opex and capex criteria. As earlier
explained, the nature of an EA leaves
itself open to considerable management discretion on terms, even if they may
arise from employee
demands. It would be important, for example, to demonstrate
productivity and other improvements, consistent with wage conditions
SAPN has not mounted a compelling challenge in face of the considerable sectoral
wage growth data and wage growth trends relied
on by the AER.
the reasons given, the Tribunal concludes that the AER did not make an error of
fact or facts that was material to the making
of the decision, that the exercise
of the AER’s discretion was not incorrect or the decision unreasonable,
having regard to
all the circumstances.
Forecast inflation
cl 6.4.3(a) of the NER, the annual revenue requirement for a DNSP for each
regulatory year of a regulatory control period must
be determined using a
building block approach.
indexation of the regulatory asset base building block is in effect, a deduction
from the annual revenue requirement equal to
the amount that is referred to in
cl S6.2.3(c)(4) – that is, the amount necessary to maintain the real value
of the regulatory
asset base as at the beginning of the subsequent year by
adjusting that value for inflation.
deduction from the annual revenue requirement is needed to avoid “double
counting” of inflation. Under the NER, a
nominal rate of return is used
in combination with an inflation-adjusted regulatory asset base. Thus, without
any adjustment, service
providers would be compensated twice for the effects of
inflation – once through the rate of return and again through indexation
of the regulatory asset base. The way this is addressed in the NER is to
provide for a negative adjustment as described.
there is a mismatch between forecast and actual inflation, there will be an
inconsistency between the amount by which the regulatory
asset base is increased
over time to account for inflation and the corresponding deductions from the
revenue allowance.
AER is required to specify appropriate methods for the indexation of the
regulatory asset base and any other amounts, values or
inputs on which its
building block determination is based. It is therefore necessary for the AER to
determine an appropriate forecast
of inflation as part of each distribution
determination.
The AER’s Final Decision
its Regulatory Proposal, SAPN adopted an inflation forecast of 2.55%. This was
based on the method applied by the AER in its distribution
determination for the
prior regulatory control period, which is to take a geometric mean 10-year
forecast based on:
for the first
two years of the regulatory control period, the mid-point of the RBA forecast
range for CPI inflation; and
for subsequent
years, the mid-point of the RBA target range for CPI inflation.
submitted a Revised Proposal in light of what it says were concerns that the
method it adopted in its Regulatory Proposal was
no longer producing accurate
its Revised Proposal, SAPN adopted a different forecasting method which produced
an inflation forecast of 2.06% for the 2015-2020
period. The revised
forecasting method was based on a report by consultant Competition Economists
’) “Measuring expected inflation for the
PTRM” June 2015 and is referred to as the “breakeven”
forecasting method. Under the CEG “breakeven” method, an
estimate of expected inflation is derived from the difference
in yields on
nominal and inflation-indexed Commonwealth Government Security
’) of the same maturity.
concern and that of CEG was that due to changes in market conditions, it was no
longer reasonable to expect inflation
to revert to the middle of the RBA target
range over the medium term. The evidence presented by CEG indicated that over
term, inflation is likely to be below the mid-point of the RBA target
range. Therefore in current market conditions a methodology
that assumes
medium-term inflation would be at or around the mid-point of the RBA target
range is likely to overestimate forecast
alternative methodology presented in its Revised Proposal was said to overcome
this limitation by relying on market-based
measures of inflation expectations.
The “breakeven” inflation forecasting method does not involve any
assumption as
to medium-term inflation. Rather, the “breakeven”
method is a measure of market expectations of inflation, as indicated

the Final Decision, the AER adopted an inflation forecast of 2.5% for the
2015-2020 regulatory control period. This was based
on the methodology that had
been adopted by the AER in its prior determination, namely:
for the first
two years of the regulatory control period, taking the mid-point of the RBA
forecast range for CPI inflation. At the
time of the AER’s Final
Decision, the RBA had published a forecast range of 2-3% for these two years,
with a mid-point of 2.5%;
for subsequent
years, taking the mid-point of the RBA target range for CPI inflation, also
AER provided the following reasons for rejecting SAPN’s alternative
methodology (Final Decision, Attachment 3, pp 253-4):
We do not accept SA Power Networks’ new method
for the following reasons:
Changing the method after we accepted the original
proposal in the preliminary determination is inconsistent with the intent of the
regulatory process. Stakeholder submissions on our preliminary determination
were made on the basis that the inflation estimation
method is not under
consideration in the final decision.
The rules mandate a nominal vanilla WACC. Consequently, the inflation
estimate is not a direct input parameter for deriving the rate
of return that
contributes to the achievement of the allowed rate of return objective. This is
consistent with a broader reading
of the NER, and in particular the express
requirement for inflation and taxation to be addressed through the PTRM.
An amendment to the PTRM is a distinct and separate process to the
assessment of an NSP’s proposal. It must follow the specific
set out by the distribution consultation procedures. Moreover, good regulatory
practice requires a comprehensive consultation
process as a prerequisite before
changing the method for estimating a parameter that impacts all NSPs and users
across multiple building
blocks thereby affecting total revenue
AER then explored features of the model used by SAPN and considered that the
research, analysis and reasoning submitted to the
AER should be subject to
review through a comprehensive process allowing effective engagement with all
stakeholders. The AER then
pointed to the importance of the PTRM process in
determining forecast inflation (Final Decision, Attachment 3, p 255):
Under both the NER and NGR, an inflation forecast is
required for modelling revenue over the next regulatory control period. The
mandates the use of the AER’s Post tax revenue model (PTRM). The NGR does
not mandate the use of the PTRM, but requires
service providers to provide
financial information on a nominal basis or real basis or some other recognised
basis for dealing with
the effects of inflation. Under the NER, the AER’s
published PTRM must include a method the AER determines is likely to result
the best estimate of inflation. Under the NGR, a service provider must propose
an estimate on a reasonable basis which is the
best forecast or estimate
possible in the circumstances. United Energy stated that the appropriate
approach to address concerns
with our current method was to undertake an
amendment to the PTRM.
Any changes/amendments to the PTRM must be done in accordance with the
distribution consultation procedures.
AER indicated that under cl 6.5.2(d)(2) of the NER, subject to achieving the
rate of return objective, it is required to determine
a rate of return on a
nominal vanilla weighted average cost of capital basis. The AER said that under
the nominal vanilla approach
an inflation forecast is therefore not a direct
input in determining the allowed rate of return.
AER also expressed its satisfaction with its current approach as reflecting the
views of stakeholders (Final Decision, Attachment
In our recent rate of return guideline development
consultation process we raised the inflation method as an issue for potential
We noted that the indexed bond market had changed since we departed
from the Fisher equation, and asked for submissions on whether
we should change
the approach. We also noted different methods and what other regulators were
adopting. In response, stakeholders
endorsed the continuation of the current
approach. We therefore are satisfied that the current approach is the
appropriate approach
for this determination.
these reasons the AER did not consider the method for forecasting inflation as
part of its distribution determination for SAPN.
The AER did not rule out a
change to the method of inflation forecasting. However in its view this needed
to be undertaken in accordance
with the consultation processes mandated by the
NER. The next rate of return guideline review was considered a more suitable
for reviewing the inflation forecasting method.
Areas of dispute
contends that the AER incorrectly exercised its discretion in failing to
consider the merits of SAPN’s methodology and
in rejecting the proposed
methodology on the basis that it was different to that originally proposed by

opinion as to the existence of future inflation.
The AER rejects this as not an
issue of fact but rather a statement of opinion.

is unnecessary to go into more detail about the errors contended by SAPN. This
is because counsel for both parties acknowledged
that the dispute now had a
fairly narrow scope. It is whether the PTRM is binding such that the AER cannot
consider inflation outside
an amendment to the PTRM or whether, as SAPN
contends, although there is a reference to inflation in the PTRM, the AER in
to give separate consideration to that issue under the NER in making
its Final Decision.
dispute will therefore be resolved on the correct interpretation of the NER.
For this reason it is also unnecessary to consider
the suitability of
SAPN’s alternative methodology or indeed the inflation forecasts derived
under that methodology.
Arguments advanced by SAPN
accepts that the inflation estimate is not a direct input parameter for deriving
the nominal rate of return under cl 6.5.2.
However, SAPN argues that just
because it is not an input into the nominal rate of return does not mean that
the inflation forecasting
methodology cannot fall for consideration by the AER
as part of making a distribution determination.
argues that the NER does not require that the inflation forecast used to
calculate the indexation of the regulatory asset base
building block be
determined in accordance with the inflation forecasting method specified in the
the contrary, SAPN says that as part of each distribution determination the AER
is required to specify appropriate methods for
the indexation of the regulatory
asset base and any other amounts, values or inputs on which its building block
determination is
based. It is therefore necessary, as part of each distribution
determination, for the AER to determine an appropriate forecast of
consistency with their context and purpose, SAPN submits that the relevant
provisions of Ch 6 are to be read as requiring the
AER to determine an
appropriate forecast of inflation as part of each distribution determination.
In contrast, the AER’s approach
is said to be rigid and will produce an
inflation forecast that is too high resulting in a total revenue allowance (all
other things
being equal) that is less than what is required to promote
efficient investment in, and efficient operation and use of, electricity
services for the long-term interests of consumers.
also points out that under the AER’s approach, the inflation forecasting
method is one input that can be effectively locked
in by the AER, without any
opportunity for stakeholders to have that method reviewed. The AER recognises
that the methods used to
determine other inputs (eg gamma, rate of return inputs
and expenditure forecasting methods) must be considered as part of each
determination.
It is therefore unclear why the method for forecasting inflation
should be treated any differently.
Arguments advanced by the AER
to SAPN’s position, the AER submits that the NER requires the inflation
forecast used to calculate the indexation of
the regulatory asset base building
block to be determined in accordance with the inflation forecasting method
specified in the PTRM.
This is said to flow from cl 6.3.1 and cl 6.4.2 of the
6.3.1(c)(1) stipulates that a building block proposal must be prepared in
accordance with the PTRM and cl 6.4.2(b)(1) stipulates
that the PTRM must
include a method that the AER determines is likely to result in the best
estimates of expected inflation. The
PTRM published by the AER includes a
method for forecasting inflation and the AER applied that method in its building
block determination
under cl 6.12.1.
noted, SAPN relies on various clauses in the NER to argue that the inflation
method specified in the PTRM is not mandatory. The
AER submits that those other
clauses cannot be read in a manner that contradicts the plain meaning of cl
6.3.1(c)(1) and cl 6.4.2(b)(1).
For example, SAPN relies on cl 6.12.1(2)(i)
which provides that one of the constituent decisions of the overall distribution
determination
is a decision on the DNSP’s current building block proposal
in which the AER either approves or refuses to approve the annual
requirement for the DNSP as set out in the building block proposal. However the
AER says that the contents of the building
block proposal are governed by Pt C
of Ch 6, and cl 6.3.1(c) stipulates that the building block proposal must
be prepared in accordance
with the PTRM.
AER also points out that the PTRM provides certainty, consistency and continuity
to DNSPs in the regulation of required revenue.
Although the PTRM is not fixed,
nevertheless the NER establishes a consultation process for amendment which
involves all DNSPs as
all DNSPs are impacted by the PTRM. The AER’s
position is not that it could never consider a change to the PTRM at the same
time as a distribution determination. However it maintains it is required to
comply with the distribution consultation procedures,
which evidence an
intention on the part of the rule makers that broad consultation occur across
the industry before any change is
Tribunal’s consideration
AER concedes there is no express provision in the NER that prohibits it from
considering inflation forecasts outside the PTRM
process. Rather its position
follows from the overall construction of the NER. Equally SAPN did not point to
a provision of the
NER that expressly requires the AER to consider its inflation
forecast, other than as part of the usual considerations that should
AER’s decision-making, like other factors it considers in making its Final
the position of both parties ultimately turns on the overall construction of the
is useful at the outset to gain some understanding of the PTRM.
PTRM is defined in the NER Glossary as the model prepared and published by the
AER in accordance with cl 6.4.1.
AER must, in accordance with the distribution consultation procedures, prepare
and publish a PTRM: cl 6.4.1(a). The AER must
ensure that a PTRM is in force at
all times: cl 6.4.1(c).
PTRM must set out the manner in which the DNSP’s annual revenue
requirement for each regulatory year of a regulatory control
period is to be
calculated: cl 6.4.2(a).
contents of the PTRM must include (but are not limited to the following (NER
cl 6.4.2(b)):
(1) a method that the AER determines is likely to
result in the best estimates of expected inflation; and
(2) the timing assumptions and associated discount rates that are to apply
in relation to the calculation of the building blocks
referred to in clause
(3) the manner in which working capital is to be treated; and
(4) the manner in which the estimated cost of corporate income tax is to be
calculated.
AER may amend the PTRM from time to time, in accordance with the distribution
consultation procedures: cl 6.4.1(b). The distribution
consultation procedures
are those procedures set out in Pt G of Ch 6. Broadly, the distribution
consultation procedures specify
the consultation steps the AER must employ,
including the use of explanatory materials and the requirement to seek comments
interested parties before making a relevant decision.
practical terms, the PTRM is an excel spreadsheet. The Tribunal was taken to a
brief demonstration of its application. From the
illustration (and as counsel
explained) the PTRM is a excel file that contains various cells corresponding to
various parameters
required in arriving at a final decision on building blocks.
A DNSP is required to input numbers into various cells. As we understand,
aspects of the PTRM have been preset within the model, for example the inflation
forecast. When the model is run those preset
features apply to the remainder of
the inputs made by a DNSP.
that way the AER can assess the responses consistently across all DNSPs, with
the knowledge that the features of the model will
automatically have been
incorporated, including the preset parameters.
should be noted that although the Tribunal was provided with a brief
illustration of an extract of the PTRM, the full PTRM, the
process by which it
is determined and practically applied was not the subject of any significant
evidence. Given the way in which
the arguments were presented, presumably a
greater understanding of the PTRM is not required as ultimately the issue turns
proper place of the PTRM in the scheme of regulation under the NER.
PTRM is expressly employed in some parts of the NER. For example, the formula
specified in cl 6.5.3 in estimating the cost of
corporate income tax expressly
requires that the estimate of taxable income be determined using the PTRM. It
is also used to calculate
incremental revenue in circumstances where a DNSP has
applied under cl 6.6.2 to vary a determination where a trigger event for a
contingent project in relation to that determination has occurred.
immediate observation to make is that the rule makers sought to expressly
include a PTRM in the NER, specified the matters it
should contain and how the
PTRM should be amended. Having gone to those lengths, there is a strong
suggestion that the rule makers
intended the PTRM to occupy a particular place
in the scheme of regulation in the NER.
appears that the first PTRM was published in 2008, the second version in 2009
and the current version (version 3) was published
in January 2015.
The NER and the PTRM
indicated, cl 6.3.1(c)(1) directs that a building block be prepared in
accordance with the PTRM. For the AER this indicates that
a DNSP cannot depart
from a parameter preset in the PTRM. However SAPN places a different
construction on the clause having regard
to the practical workings of the PTRM
itself. For SAPN, what that clause requires is only that a DNSP submit numbers
in accordance
with that model so that the AER can coherently consider the data
at its end. That is, the direction given by cl 6.3.1(c)(1) is only
model, not that the preset parameters themselves are beyond challenge in
submitting a proposal to the AER.
reconcile the direction given by cl 6.3.1(c)(1) with a different inflation
forecast to the PTRM, SAPN distinguishes between two
phases of a proposal.
Under the first phase, the building block proposal must, as required by cl
6.3.1(c)(1), be submitted in terms
of the model that is the PTRM. But then
different considerations are said to apply in the second phase – the
making of the
determination.
6.3.2 in this second phase specifies the matters that must be considered in
making a building block determination. One of
those matters is in cl
6.3.2(a)(2) – the appropriate methods for the indexation of the regulatory
asset base. SAPN says that
provision stands alone and is not constrained by the
PTRM. Certainly there is no express reference there to the PTRM. Of course
AER’s response is that there is no need to mention it because if a DNSP
complies with cl 6.3.1(c)(1), then the PTRM will
have dealt with the issue
through the preset parameters in the PTRM.
6 does step through the process for the making of a building block determination
in fairly a sequential way. It starts as
both parties acknowledge, with a DNSP
submitting a building block proposal to the AER under cl 6.3.1(b). The
sequential nature of
the process is effectively described in that provision. It
also then notes that Pt E will apply to the making of the building block
determination.
noted, cl 6.3.1(c)(1) directs that the proposal “be prepared in accordance
with the post-tax revenue model”. It is
significant that cl 6.3.1(c)(1)
employs the word “prepared”. If all that were required is that a
DNSP simply submit
its proposal under the form of the PTRM, then the NER could
simply have directed that a proposal be submitted using the PTRM framework
some similar form of words. It does not do that. It suggests that the PTRM is
more than simply an excel template to be used
by each DNSP. The PTRM carries
substantive parameters that must be employed by a DNSP in submitting a proposal.
Immediately
following is r 6.4 which deals with the contents of the PTRM referred to above.
In one sense, having introduced the concept
of a PTRM in cl 6.3.1 it is
obviously sensible to describe what it should contain. However, it would have
been easy for the drafters
of the NER to deal with the PTRM in a schedule or
elsewhere in Ch 6. However they choose to interpose it between the contents of
a building block determination and the building block approach. This is also
because the PTRM is more than a mere tool in which
to submit a proposal.
drafting of r 6.4 also lends support to this view. First, cl 6.4.1(c) requires
the PTRM to be “in force” at all times.
It is not merely that the
PTRM be available for use. Secondly, the PTRM cannot be amended at a whim. It
can only be amended under
the distribution consultation procedures. There would
be little point in the rule makers establishing such a significant
“gatekeeping”
requirement if the PTRM were little more than a tool
in which to submit a proposal. Finally, the PTRM must establish a
that the AER determines is likely to result in the best
estimates of expected inflation (cl 6.4.2(b)(1)). The requirement to establish
a “method” is a far stronger and significant direction than simply
to establish a tool by which to submit a proposal.
this sequence, cl 6.4.3(a)(1) then specifies that one of the building blocks in
calculating the annual revenue requirement
is the indexation of the regulatory
asset base. For the purposes of indexing the regulatory asset base cl
6.4.3(b)(1) provides that
the regulatory asset base is to be calculated under cl
6.5.1 and Sch 6.2 and that the building block comprises a negative adjustment
equal to the amount referred to in cl S6.2.3(c)(4) for that year. This is the
source of the negative adjustment referred to earlier.
is in the context of the roll forward of the regulatory asset base that
S6.2.3(c)(4) provides:
(c) Method of adjustment of value of regulatory
The value of the regulatory asset base for a distribution system as at the
beginning of the second or a subsequent year (the later
year) in a regulatory
control period must be calculated by adjusting the value (the previous value) of
the regulatory asset base
for that distribution system as at the beginning of
the immediately preceding regulatory year (the previous year) in that regulatory
control period as follows:

amount necessary to maintain the real value of the regulatory
asset base as at

be adjusted for the effect of inflation.
6.5.1(b) requires that the AER in accordance with the distribution consultation
procedures, develop and publish a model (the
roll forward
’) for the roll forward of the regulatory asset base. The AER
may amend or replace the roll forward model from time to time
in accordance with
the distribution consultation procedures: cl 6.5.1(c). The purpose of the roll
forward model (as the name suggests)
is to deal with movements from one
regulatory control period to the next. Clause 6.5.1(e)(3) requires in
particular that the roll
forward model set out the method for determining the
roll forward of the regulatory asset base for distribution systems under
(3) the roll forward of the regulatory asset base
from the immediately preceding regulatory control period to the beginning of the
first regulatory year of a subsequent regulatory control period entails the
value of the first mentioned regulatory asset base being
adjusted for actual
inflation, consistently with the method used for the indexation of the control
mechanism (or control mechanisms)
for standard control services during the
preceding regulatory control period.
clause refers to adjustments for actual inflation in the case of the first roll
forward. Clause 6.5.1(f) provides that “[o]ther
provisions relating to
regulatory asset bases are set out in schedule 6.2”. In other words,
there is a reference to Sch 2
in both cl 6.4.3(b) dealing with the specification
of the building blocks and also through cl 6.5.1.
should be noted that neither cl S6.2.3(c)(4) nor cl 6.5.1(e)(3) expressly refer
to the adjustment for inflation or the roll forward
of the regulatory asset base
occurring consistently with the PTRM. SAPN argues that the AER should therefore
determine an appropriate
forecast for inflation without being constrained by the
PTRM. For if it were constrained by the PTRM that rigid approach would be
inconsistent with the framework of the NER that looks to a revenue allowance
that allows a DNSP to recover efficient costs. An inflation
forecast that is
too high or low (through slavish reliance on the PTRM) would be inconsistent
with that framework. The AER’s
response is that these provisions do not
deal with inflation because inflation is embedded in the PTRM from the first
moment a DNSP
is directed to submit its building block proposal.
understand the AER’s argument it is necessary to return to the next step
in the sequence in the making of a determination.
The remaining provisions in
Pt C then proceed to address features of the other building blocks such as the
return on capital and
depreciation. Having dealt with those building blocks, Pt
E then logically addresses the determination process. That starts with
submitting a regulatory proposal to the AER under cl 6.8.2. The regulatory
proposal must include a building block proposal:
cl 6.8.2(c)(2). Following
consultation the AER is required to publish a draft determination which also
includes a consultation process:
cl 6.10.1(a). A DNSP is required to respond to
a draft determination by submitting revisions “so as to incorporate the
of any changes required to address matters raised by the draft
distribution determination or the AER’s reasons for it”:
cl 6.10.3(b). A related criticism made by the AER is that this precludes
SAPN submitting a new inflation methodology as it is not
in truth a response to
the draft determination. In view of the Tribunal’s ultimate conclusion,
it is unnecessary to consider
the merits of that argument.
final stage in the sequence is the making by the AER of a final determination:
6.12.3 deals with the extent of the AER’s discretion in making a
distribution determination. Clause 6.12.3(a) provides:
Subject to this clause and other provisions of this
Chapter 6 explicitly negating or limiting the AER’s discretion, the AER
has a discretion to accept or approve, or to refuse to accept or approve, any
element of a regulatory proposal or proposed tariff
aspect of the AER’s discretion in approving the annual revenue requirement
is dealt with in cl 6.12.3(d):
The AER must approve the total revenue requirement
for a Distribution Network Service Provider for a regulatory control period, and
the annual revenue requirement for each regulatory year of the regulatory
control period, as set out in the Distribution Network
Service Provider’s
current building block proposal, if the AER is satisfied that those amounts have
been properly
calculated using the post-tax revenue model
on the basis of
amounts calculated, determined or forecast in accordance with the requirements
of Part C of this Chapter 6.
(Emphasis added).
effect of cl 6.12.3(d) is that the AER has no discretion but to approve the
total revenue requirements for a DNSP if it is satisfied
that it has been
calculated using the PTRM. It is significant that the clause requires the
amounts to have been “calculated”
using the PTRM. That expression
ascribes to the PTRM a status more than merely a device or tool in which a
proposal should be submitted.
Ultimately it plays a material part in the
determination of the total revenue requirement. It is also significant that
and the AER are bound by the PTRM through this clause. It is no more
open to the AER to substitute an alternative inflation forecast
through the
building blocks than it is for SAPN. This is because the AER has no discretion
but to approve a revenue requirement
that has been calculated using the
this journey reveals is that the PTRM features at the very beginning of the
determination process (when a DNSP is directed to
submit a building block
proposal that complies with the PTRM) and at the very end of the process when
the AER is obliged to approve
a revenue requirement (reflecting the building
blocks) calculated using the PTRM. The common link between the start and end of
process is the PTRM. Having given the PTRM such a central place the rule
makers did not see a need to expressly refer to it again
in any of the
intermediate stages or for example in dealing with the roll forward provisions.
this stage it is worth returning to SAPN’s fundamental criticism of
AER’s approach – that it is too rigid and
will produce and inflation
forecast that is too high resulting in a total revenue allowance (all other
things being equal) that is
less than what is required to promote efficient
investment in, and efficient operation and use of, electricity services for the
interests of consumers. There are several difficulties with this
argument. First it assumes that SAPN’s methodology and the
forecast it derives is correct. That has not been established. Indeed the
distribution consultation procedures ensure
that these arguments can be fully
ventilated and debated before a new PTRM is established. SAPN has the
opportunity to put forward
the model and have it “tested” as part of
that process.
the rule makers have determined to give the PTRM an express role within the NER
as we have explained – presumably
to ensure consistency between
DNSP’s and regulatory decisions. Having done so, the AER must comply.
That is no more rigid
an approach than the requirement to comply with other
directives in the NER.
cl 6.4.1(b) permits the AER to amend or replace the PTRM from time to time.
There are no limits on how many times it may
do so. Further the distribution
consultation procedures do not appear to preclude a review of the PTRM occurring
during the distribution
determination process, if there is adequate time within
the consultation procedures in which to do so. In that way a DNSP need not
prejudiced should it wish to advance an alternative model as SAPN sought to do.
the reasons given, the Tribunal concludes that the PTRM is binding on SAPN and
the AER such that AER cannot consider inflation
outside the PTRM, as proposed by
SAPN. Accordingly the Tribunal concludes that the AER did not make any error.
no error has been found in the Final Decision, it is unnecessary to consider the
operation of s 71P(2a)(c) of the NEL.
view of the above reasons, the determination of the Tribunal is that the Final
Decision is affirmed.
