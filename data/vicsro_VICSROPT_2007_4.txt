Contractors - What constitutes a day's work? (PT-131) [2007] VICSROPT 4 (1 May 2007)
Revenue Rulings
Pay-roll Tax Act 1971
deems a person (whether incorporated or not) who
entered into a `relevant contract' with a business (the
principal) to be an employee of the principal, and
payments made to such persons to be wages for the
purposes of the Act. Deemed wages under
of the Act are subject to pay-roll tax.
While most contracts for the provision for services
come within the meaning of `relevant contracts'
of the Act, there are certain types
of contracts that are specifically excluded from the
definition of `relevant contracts'. One of the exclusions
is a contract for services of a kind ordinarily required
by the principal for less than 180 days in a financial
(section 3C(1)(e)(ii)
of the Act and Revenue
Ruling PT.127). Another one is a contract for services
by a person providing the same or similar services to a
principal under the contract for no more than 90 days
in a financial year
(section 3C(1)(e)(iii)
of the Act and
Revenue Ruling PT.119).
The purpose of this Revenue Ruling is to clarify what
constitutes a day's work for the purposes of sections
3C(1)(e)(ii) and 3C(1)(e)(iii) of the Act.
A calendar day on which work is performed under
a contract is counted as a `day' in determining the
number of days on which work is performed by a
contractor, regardless of the amount of time worked
on that day.
Contractor A
Contractor B
Wednesday 4 10
Thursday 2 9
Saturday 2 5
For the purposes of determining whether the exclusions
provided by
sections 3C(1)(e)(ii)
(1)(e)(iii) of
the Act apply, both Contractor A and Contractor B are
considered to have worked for six days even though
Contractor A has worked for only 18 hours for that
period and Contractor B has worked for 52 hours
during the same period.
Please note that rulings do not have the force of
law. Each decision made by the State Revenue
Office is made on the merits of each individual
case having regard to any relevant ruling. All
rulings must be read subject to Revenue Ruling
