APC UPDATE | 16 December 2014
Summary of latest adjudication
Complainant / The Sydney Morning Herald
The Press Council has concluded that its Standards of Practice were breached
in relation to an online article in The Sydney Morning
Herald on 22 January 2014
headed “Bidding war for Schapelle Corby’s first post-jail
interview”. The article said
the Corby family was negotiating about the
first TV interview with Ms Corby after her release from jail and that her
mother, Rosleigh
Rose, “even allowed the (Seven) network to fly her to
The Council could not be sure whether the Seven network paid or arranged for
Ms Rose’s flight and whether the publication took
reasonable steps to
check the assertion before the article appeared. However, the Council concluded
that in the particular circumstances
of the case the publication did not make
sufficient attempts to contact Ms Rose after the article appeared so she could
have a reasonable
opportunity for a balancing response. This constituted a
breach of the Council’s Standards of Practice.
