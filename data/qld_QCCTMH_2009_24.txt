REASONS FOR DECISION
is an application for legal representation filed by homeowners who are
respondents to an application made under the
Manufactured Homes (Residential
Parks) Act 2003
(“the MHRPA”) for orders to terminate the
respondents’ site agreements. The respondents own respectively three
manufactured homes positioned in the Alex Beach Top Tourist Park situated at
21-23 Okinya Road, Alexandra Headland (“the park”),
which is owned
and operated by W & T Enterprises (Qld) Pty Ltd (“the
applicant”). The three separate applications
for termination of the
respective site agreements have been consolidated and will be heard
applicant does not seek to be legally represented and opposes the granting of
leave for legal representation to the respondents.
The parties have filed
written submissions on the issue of legal representation and have agreed that
the issue of legal representation
should be determined on the papers.
applicant submits that the person who will represent it at the hearing is a
director of the company, Ms E Lawson, and that, although
Ms Lawson is a
solicitor in a firm that practises exclusively in planning and environment law,
she is not experienced in presenting
arguments to a court or tribunal. The
applicant argues that two of the respondents, Mr Way and Ms Bemi, have more
experience in
presenting matters to this Tribunal than does Ms Lawson.
is further submitted that the orders sought in the respondents’ defence
include an order that the applicant pay the respondents’
applicant has not claimed its costs as part of its application for termination
of site agreements. The applicant is
concerned that if the respondents do
engage a firm of pro bono solicitors and are successful in having the
applications for termination
of site agreement and determination of compensation
dismissed, the pro bono solicitors may bring an application to the Tribunal to
seek to recover their costs from the applicant. It is submitted that it is
unlikely that a firm of solicitors would not attempt
to recover their costs if
any option to do so exists.
respondents submit that Ms Lawson is a qualified practising solicitor who has
formal training in the conduct and procedures of
a hearing and in the
preparation and presentation of documents required by the Tribunal, whilst the
respondents lack that training.
They submit that the choice of a
legally-trained director over other directors of the applicant company who have
no legal training
gives the applicant an advantage in the proceedings, while
placing the respondents at a disadvantage. They further submit that they
only pro bono representation so the issue of costs is not applicable. They
submit that there are complex legal, and factual
issues involved which would
best be presented to the Tribunal by a legally-trained person, and without legal
representation the proceedings
may be unduly lengthened.
relevant provisions of the
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act 2003
(“the CCT Act”) are sections 73 and 76 which provide:-
“73 Purposes of div 8
The main purpose of this division is to have parties represent themselves
and save legal costs unless the interests of justice require
represents party at other proceedings
(1) Subject to the provisions of an empowering Act or
subsection (2) or (3), in a proceeding—
(a) a party, other than an individual, appearing before the tribunal may
be represented only by a person who is not a lawyer; and
(b) an individual appearing before the tribunal must represent himself or
(2) A party may be represented by a lawyer if—
(a) the proceeding relates to an application under the
Building Services Authority Act 1991
(b) the proceeding is a disciplinary proceeding; or
(c) the proceeding is a public examination; or
(d) all parties to the proceeding agree; or
(e) the tribunal directs that representation by the lawyer is appropriate
having regard to all the circumstances including, for example—
(i) the cost of representation and whether each party can afford to be
represented; and
(ii) the complexity of the legal and factual issues involved; and
(iii) the potential for lengthening the proceeding if a party is not
represented; and
(iv) the ability of the lawyer or other person to help the tribunal and
the party represented; and
(v) t he ability of the party to represent himself or herself.
(3) An individual appearing before the tribunal may be represented by a
person who is not a lawyer if the tribunal directs that representation
person is appropriate having regard to all the circumstances.”
regard to the relevant factors in section 76(2)(e) of the CCT Act, the Tribunal
notes that the applicant does not claim that
it cannot afford legal
representation. The Tribunal is aware that both Ms Lawson and Mr Way have
appeared in the Tribunal in approximately
10 other matters involving disputes
between the applicant and home owners in this park, and Mr Way has also
represented homeowners
in other parks before the Tribunal. However these
proceedings seek orders which will have a significantly greater impact upon the
respondents than any orders they have sought in the earlier matters, which have
involved in the main determinations as to the fairness
of site rent increases or
the interpretation of the terms of site agreements. The respondents here are
seeking to resist orders
which if granted will require them to vacate the park
which has been their home for many years. The Tribunal does not believe that
representation by Mr Way will in this case be adequate to properly safeguard the
respondents’ interests.
the respondents fail to establish their defence that the ground for termination
under section 38(1)(f) of the MHRPA is not made
out, then they will have to
persuade the Tribunal that in the circumstances the Tribunal should refuse in
its discretion to terminate
the site agreements. If the respondents are
unsuccessful in resisting a termination order, they will need to persuade the
as to the appropriate compensation to be paid under section 40(1) of
the MHRPA. The hearing will therefore involve reasonably complex
issues of fact
and law and a fairly substantial amount of money if compensation is
matter will also have important ramifications for other home owners in the park.
In its statement of evidence filed in the proceedings
on 14 October 2009 the
applicant states:-
“If the applicant obtains termination orders (and
subsequent determination by the Tribunal of the compensation amount) the
intends on contacting the remaining home owners to attempt to have
them enter into a voluntary agreement to terminate the site agreements
accept the compensation amount determined by the Tribunal. If the remaining
their site agreements with W
& T and accept the compensation amount (possibly determined by the Tribunal)
W & T will make
the applications to terminate all remaining site agreements
and determine the compensation payable at the one time.”
Tribunal has reached the conclusion that in the circumstances the interests of
justice will best be served if the respondents
are legally represented.
applicant will not in the Tribunal’s view be disadvantaged if Ms Lawson
represents it while the respondents are legally
represented. Ms Lawson is well
equipped because of her familiarity with the MHRPA and with procedures in the
Tribunal to present
the applicant’s case. However if the applicant wishes
to engage an independent solicitor or barrister to represent it, then
in fairness be permitted to do so. The Tribunal will therefore grant leave for
legal representation to the applicant also.
considered the matters set out in section 76(2)(e) of the CCT Act, the Tribunal
is satisfied that having regard to all the
circumstances it is appropriate that
all parties should be granted leave to be legally represented in these
proceedings.
Tribunal makes the following order:-
parties are granted leave to be legally represented in the proceedings.
