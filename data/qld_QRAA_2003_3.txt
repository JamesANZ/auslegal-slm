RACING APPEALS AUTHORITY
[2003] QRAA 03
: 31 January 2003
Georgina Mitchell
APPEAL FROM
A decision by the Stewards
of the Queensland Harness Racing Board to suspend her trainer’s licence
for a period of 8 weeks.
BREACH OF RULE
APPEARANCES
: Mr PJ Davis of Counsel instructed by Hewlett
& Company appeared on behalf of the Appellant.
Mr K Adams, Steward
appeared on behalf of the Respondent.
REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr Leo G Williams AO - Chairman
The Hon Sir James Killen - Deputy
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
This an appeal by
Mrs Mitchell against the decision of the Stewards of the Queensland Harness
Board to suspend her trainer’s
licence for a period of 8 weeks after
finding that she breached Rule 240 of the Rules of Harness Racing.
240 provides:
“A person shall not whether alone or in association with
others, do, permit or suffer anything before, during or after a race
the opinion of the stewards of the controlling body may cause someone to be
unlawfully disadvantaged or be penalised or
is corrupt or otherwise
This appeal at the request of the Appellant was heard
together with the appeal by Mr Denis Gordon Holbeck who appealed against the
finding by the Stewards that he breached Rule 149(1) of the Rules of Harness
Racing. A separate decision in relation to Mr Holbeck’s
appeal has been
given by the Authority with this decision and for background of both matters the
Authority refers to that decision.
Mrs Mitchell was quite definite in her
instructions to Mr Holbeck as to how to drive Station Road in the race and this
was summarised
in pages 81 and 82 of the Stewards inquiry transcript when Mrs
Mitchell after referring to when the horse in its previous run
when it was restrained stated to Mr
... “Listen, I don’t care where
we’re going”, but I said “If we get into the Christmas
I said, “I bet your bottom dollar we’ll end up with
6”. When it came out it come 6. I said, “The only instruction
give you from that”, I said, “well, we won’t be leading, but,
for starters, we’re going to be out in no-man’s
said, “There’ll be no pulling back, Denis. You’ll be pressing
on.” I said, “When
you press on, you’ll let him bowl
From viewing of the race video and the video of
Station Hand’s previous run it is clear that the Stewards had reason to
the driving tactics.
The particulars given by the Stewards to
Mrs Mitchell are stated in page 69 of the transcript as
The stewards are alleging that by issuing instructions
to your driver, Denis Holbeck, on the horse - that the horse be driven in a
manner which you indicated prior to the running of race 5, the Ray Hollis
Patrons Cup at Redcliffe on 20 December, that by issuing
those instructions to
drive the horse in that manner, that you placed your driver, Denis Holbeck, in a
position where he may be penalised
by the stewards.
Mr Davis has submitted to the Authority that there is no allegation by the
Stewards against Mrs Mitchell that she has done
anything which is
“corrupt” or “otherwise improper”.
This is one of
those difficult situations where instructions given by a trainer turn out to be
wrong and where the Stewards with the
benefit of hindsight and having viewed the
video form an opinion that the trainer should have known that the instructions
to be wrong.
The driver, Mr Holbeck, followed the instructions
given by Mrs Mitchell and drove what turned out to be an ill-judged race. He was
penalised by the Stewards. The only evidence ultimately before this Authority
was that the instructions were given in the honest
and reasonable but mistaken
belief that they would allow the horse the best chance to win.
Mitchell does not appear to have arrived at this decision negligently or with
any element of dishonesty although this was canvassed
by the Stewards. In
seeking to impose penalties following the substitution of their opinion the
Stewards must have a proper basis
for forming their own opinion and it must be
other than simply that instructions like this were wrong. There has to be some
element involved to support a breach of Rule 240.
The Authority
does not believe there is enough evidence to support a breach of Rule
The appeal is therefore allowed and the appeal fee is to be
