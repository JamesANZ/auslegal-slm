Some thoughts on the US election
Tackling Cyber Risk
Content Moderation
Active Measures Can Work against One’s Own Constituents
Some thoughts on the US
Ravi Nayyar
21 November 2020
In the build-up to the 2016 NRL Grand Final, legendary sports commentator,
Roy Slaven, described rugby league as a “grand, wonderful
old game that
provides us with so much entertainment and
I believe those words can be applied to an American Presidential election.
Here are my takeaways from the 2020 edition thereof, with
a focus on the
tackling of cyber risk by the US Government, content moderation by social media
platforms and active measures by pro-Trump
Tackling Cyber Risk
No matter which candidate had won, the election can be said to have belonged
to the US Government agencies who were incredibly proactive
in their efforts to
secure the electoral process and infrastructure, and combat threats thereto.
Strong performers were arguably
United States Cyber Command and the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (
), in partnership
with other government entities like the National Security Agency and Federal
Bureau of Investigation (
), as well as the private
It is arguable that the US
Government has learned much since the experience of the 2016 election and
applied those lessons to protect
the 2020 election. The fruits thereof can be
said to be evident in the reported absence of major interference via cyberspace
election systems by the time when polls
The government’s proactivity is arguably reflective of the increasing
assertiveness of the United States in the 5
domain of warfare
during the Trump Administration more generally, as demonstrated by the:
indictment of foreign (state-backed)
successful attack of the
Russian state-backed troll farm, the Internet Research Agency, during the 2018
midterm elections;
offensive cyber operations against the TrickBot
and (in partnership with
countries including Australia)
and compromise of malicious
Russian cyber actors’ tactics, techniques and procedures by publishing
their malware on threat
repository,
VirusTotal.
The joint announcement
in the lead-up to Election Day by the Directors of National Intelligence, the
FBI and CISA, about Iran allegedly
sending a series of intimidating emails
– purporting to come from the violent extremist organisation, Proud Boys
Democratic voters
underscored this willingness to call out and move against malicious
(state-backed) cyber activity targeting US interests.
One should note, however, that the above has arguably been marred by
President Trump’s sacking of CISA Director, Christopher
Krebs, after he
and his agency repeatedly called out claims of electoral fraud, including those
by the President, as groundless.
Krebs was respected by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as well as members
of the cybersecurity profession during his tenure,
making his firing all the
more unfortunate for the future of US Government cybersecurity and cybersecurity
policy. It was arguably
unsurprising that even rumours of the termination of
Krebs’ appointment, let alone the event itself, attracted heavy criticism
of the President and sympathy for the former Director from members of the
private sector and government cybersecurity bodies, and
parliamentarians.
Content Moderation
To continue the theme of 'lessons learned from 2016', this election was as
much about the social media platforms that dominate the
US information
environment as the candidates themselves. These platforms represent,
substantively, the main gatekeepers for that
information environment. The
election can be regarded as a test of platforms’ content moderation policy
settings and enforcement.
Their performance ranged from swift proactivity (such
as Twitter)
to an apparent
paucity of dedicated policies and resources related to the labelling and/or
takedown of election-related disinformation
until quite late, if at all (such as
YouTube’s recalcitrance relative to its competitors in this area is
arguably quite serious. The fact that it is the most widely
used social media
platform in the United States means that its content moderation policies and
enforcement thereof can exert a great
deal of influence on the US information
environment. YouTube’s relative opacity when it comes to public relations
and governance
exacerbates these issues by complicating attempts to scrutinise
its decision-making regarding
disinformation.
To add to such
concerns, it was found that YouTube profited from a livestream of a recent press
conference held by President Trump’s
personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani
– at which he spread several election-related conspiracy theories –
by allowing viewers
of the livestream to pay a fee (30% of which goes to
YouTube) to pin their comments to the top of the comment
These sorts of issues have
raised questions about why YouTube’s CEO, Susan Wojicki, has not been
summoned to testify before
the US Congress, unlike her counterparts at Twitter
and Facebook who have appeared multiple
Nonetheless, it is still early to rate comprehensively the performance of
social media platforms as a whole in the election content
moderation context and
predict how companies will modify their moderation guidelines, if they
The recent appearance of
Facebook and Twitter’s CEOs before the US Senate Judiciary Committee was
reported to suggest that
change to their platforms' policies was not likely in
the short-term.
Twitter had already confirmed that the President’s Trump's personal
account will lose its privileged status for
moderation purposes on 20 January
2021 when he is no longer the President. His account will be regulated by the
platform just like
that of any ordinary user and would no longer enjoy
‘public interest’
protections.
It will be interesting to see whether, and, if so, how, the present seemingly
self-regulatory model for content moderation will evolve,
or whether a Biden
Administration will threaten dilution or outright removal of protections under
section 230 of the
Communications Decency
if social media
platforms do not work harder to tackle misinformation and disinformation. The
platforms would be aware of the President-Elect
himself signalling his support
for the immediate repeal of the stated statutory
Alongside these
factors, one should keep track of how Mark Zuckerberg will deal with a centre
left-leaning White House, given his
company's courtship of the conservative side
of politics for years now.
The hostility of a Biden White House to Silicon Valley, however, could be
tempered by how the latter is well-represented in, or has
otherwise close ties
with, the Biden-Harris transition team. Such tempering may be informed by
sizeable political donations from
members of the US technology sector to
pro-Biden causes. These factors can influence the future Biden
Administration’s policies
in favour of Silicon Valley and (perhaps more
importantly) drive favourable appointments at federal regulators that are the
overseers of the sector, including the Federal Communications Commission
and Federal Trade Commission, and the head of the US Department
Justice’s antitrust
Active Measures Can Work against One’s Own
Constituents
The fact that the result was not a complete landslide for President-Elect
Biden can be argued to reflect the effectiveness of active
measures designed and
executed properly by the Trump team and Trump supporters
against their own
compatriots
I agree with
respected academic, Thomas Rid, on the point that ‘[President]
Trump’s very impressive results in 2020,
even if he loses, should put
another big nail in the coffin of the theory that he owed his win in 2016 to
Russian interference (or
While the active measures deployed by Russian state actors had
impact on the 2016 election, that was considered far less than domestic US
actors during the same election.
The Trump team used the
same tactics to greater effect
throughout the
2016 campaign and arguably since then (perhaps that was the Russian
Government’s objective all
Of particular note is the President's facilitating the spread of the Qanon
conspiracy theory, despite the FBI's having labelled it
a domestic terrorism
Roughly half of his
supporters are Qanon supporters, not least since the President has failed to
condemn this conspiracy theory.
The Trump legacy includes there being around a dozen political candidates from
the Republican Party who support(ed) or fail(ed) to
condemn Qanon, two of whom
have now been elected to the US House of
Representatives.
The effect of the Trump team’s active measures in relation to Qanon is
also serious in light of Qanon supporters organising
around the use of
information warfare tactics to shape the US political conversation in favour of
President Trump. Given the inherently
pro-Trump nature of Qanon, such activity
can further corrode the US information environment by synergising with, and
reinforcing,
the outputs of active measures from the current White House against
Trump’s political
That corrosive effect
is arguably writ large in a threat to Philadelphia election officials from
alleged Qanon supporters who were
charged with having a concealed firearm
without a license and carrying a firearm on public streets or public
The potential impact of active measures by, and/or in support of, the Trump
campaign may also be seen in voting patterns in the state
of Florida, which
experienced a rise in support for President Trump among Latinx
It is clear that social
media platforms were so focused on English-language disinformation risk that
they appear to have not tackled
Spanish-language disinformation risk to the same
This arguably helped
Spanish-language disinformation operators play to the fears of voters with South
American heritage by pushing
falsities about Biden being a socialist and not a
real Catholic, and the Black Lives Matter movement (which Biden supports) being
anarchical and anti-Latinx.
Trump campaign itself adopted such tactics in Spanish-language advertisements on
social media platforms and TV channels in Florida.
Trump was no doubt aided by
concerted anti-Biden messaging emanating from an increasing number of
Spanish-language political commentators
who generally peddle baseless conspiracy
theories to their sizeable social media followings in Latinx
communities.
These factors could
be behind why Biden’s margin in Florida’s most populous county,
Miami-Dade (with a thriving Latinx
community), was less than a third of that
which Hillary Clinton enjoyed in
While one looks forward to further analysis on the impact of the
aforementioned active measures, who their purveyors were and their
impact on the
overall election result, one should note the age-old caveat about active
measures: by their very nature as vehicles
for disinformation, their
effectiveness is hard to
There is always the
danger about overstating the impact of active measures and playing right into
the (internal and/or external)
adversary's hands by thus self-exacerbating the
divisions in your body politic which the adversary sought to exploit in the
This was a fascinating election to observe from multiple perspectives, be
they with regard to cyber risk, content moderation by social
media platforms, or
indeed active measures by domestic US actors against fellow citizens. There were
positive outcomes, such as the
robust cybersecurity of the election, but also
things meriting a great degree of concern, including the growth of

campaigns targeting the American body politic from within,
alongside the spread of dangerous conspiracy theories that can jeopardise
