LEGISLATION:

respondent JC Craig Constructions Pty Ltd shall pay the applicant’s
Michael and Elizabeth Ashley costs on a party/party

REASONS FOR DECISION
APPLICATION
30 October 2013 I determined the application in favour of the applicants and
ordered the respondent to pay the applicants the sum
of $423,086.00 by 20
November 2013. I ordered the parties to file and serve written submissions on
costs by the same date if they
could not reach an agreement. The parties were
also ordered to confirm whether they consented to having the question of costs
with on the papers. On 20 November 2013 a submission on costs was received
from the applicants’ solicitor and on 5 December
applicants’ solicitor consented to the issue of costs being determined
without a hearing. No submission was received
on or on behalf of the respondent
and on 19 December 2013 the respondent’s representative consented to the
application for
costs being dealt with without a hearing. I have considered the
submission provided on behalf of the applicants in making a decision
in relation
to the issue.
in relation to applications before the Tribunal are dealt with in
Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal Act
and in Clause 20 of
Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal Regulation 2009
. Clause 20(4) of the
Regulation states that in any proceedings in respect of which the amount claimed
or in dispute is more than
$30,000.00, the Tribunal may award costs “in
such circumstances as it thinks fit”. The amount claimed in this case
$30,000.00. The Tribunal therefore has a wide discretion in relation to
making an order for costs.
purpose of making a costs order is to provide compensation to the party in whose
favour the order is made for the expense the
party has been put to in
prosecuting or defending legal proceedings. In general terms, a party who is
successful is entitled to an
order for costs in its favour, subject to certain
limited exceptions generally involving misconduct on the part of that party.
for example,
Latoudis v Casey
[1990] HCA 59
[1990] 170 CLR 534
Richmond River Council
[1998] HCA 11)
FINDINGS AND
noted above, the applicants were 100% successful in these proceedings. There was
no misconduct by the applicants during the proceedings
which would preclude them
from being awarded costs on the usual basis. While the submission filed on
behalf of the respondent refers
to indemnity costs, I am not satisfied that
costs should be awarded on that basis. Even though the respondent claimed to be
to undertake the rectification work, I am not satisfied that this extended
the hearing or unnecessarily added to costs, particularly
given that the
applicants were initially prepared to have the respondent undertake the
rectification works. In this regard, I note
that the applicants had as recently
as 30 August 2013 asked the Tribunal to adjourn the proceedings for 12 months to
allow the respondent
to undertake the works.
summary, I am satisfied that the applicants have established a basis for an
order for costs on a party/party basis. The above order
is made accordingly.
