The Korean National Commission for UNESCO hosted in Seoul an
International
Forum on Privacy Rights in the Digital Age
from 27 - 29 September 2005, the
participants in which were academic and NGO experts on privacy issues from nine
regional countries.
The Forum heard country reports from the People’s
Republic of China, Malaysia, Philippines, India, Thailand, Japan, Korea,
Australia and New Zealand, and assessments of global developments in privacy
standards, technology and ethics.
The strong contributions to the meeting by numerous Korean academic and NGO
experts on privacy also made very clear the extent to
which privacy is regarded
as a very serious issue which is prompting detailed examination in South
Korea’s very technically
advanced society which is now approaching
‘ubiquitous computing’ to an extent not yet seen elsewhere in the
At the conclusion of the Forum, the participants unanimously agreed to make
and to promote a
Declaration of Privacy Rights Action Programme in the
Asia-Pacific Region on the occasion of the International Forum on Privacy Rights
in the Digital Age
(only the near-final draft is available at the time of
. The UNESCO Forum’s Declaration tries to strike a careful
balance, noting both threats to privacy ‘while also understanding
legitimate needs of government and business’ and that data protection also
‘promotes the free flow of information’.
The Declaration calls on
data subjects, commercial organisations, and NGOs to play their parts in
promoting awareness and observance
of privacy rights. It then makes more
specific appeals to regional governments, and privacy bodies, and to UNESCO
itself. This is
UNESCO’s most significant intervention into privacy
issues, and it appears that UNESCO is now the lead UN agency taking an
in privacy issues.
The UNESCO Forum Declaration calls on regional governments framing privacy
laws ‘to study privacy laws and implementation experience
countries in addition to the APEC framework and other international privacy
agreements’. It calls on international
organisations (of which the most
significant regional examples are the ‘PANZA+’ meeting of data
protection agencies,
and APEC’s ECSG Privacy Sub-Group) to collaborate
with each other and also to ‘consult with regional NGOs concerned with
Responding to Montreux
The Declaration is also significant because, though it deals with broader
themes and has been in planning for some months, it also
includes the first
regional response to the ‘Montreux Declaration’ of the global
meeting of Privacy and Data Protection
Commissioners in Switzerland earlier in
First, it adopts and modifies the ‘principles of data protection’
set out in the Montreux Declaration as universal principles,
couching this in
terms of ‘willingness to strengthen the international recognition of the
universal nature of these principles,
in the spirit of UNESCO’. The
Declaration also amends the Montreux version to include an additional principle
of correction,
replacing the collection limitation of fairness (which is implied
elsewhere) with a limitation to ‘necessary’ collection
(a deficiency
of the Montreux principles), and including a more general reference to
‘sanctions’ rather than ‘legal
sanctions’.
Second, the Declaration calls on UNESCO itself ‘to adopt privacy
protection principles’, ‘to recommend adoption
of privacy and
personal data protection principles by the UN’, ‘to promote
discussion about privacy and personal data
protection in the Asia-Pacific
region’, and specifically ‘to promote debate about the Montreux
Declaration’s proposals,
and in particular, the Commissioners’
proposal about United Nations development of a binding legal privacy
instrument’.
Future developments
The Declaration concludes with the participants agreeing to develop ‘a
sustainable UNESCO network in this region to share information
matters and to achieve the objectives in this Declaration’. UNESCO
representatives at the meeting referred on
a number of occasions to the
likelihood that UNESCO would facilitate follow-up meetings, probably commencing
with a meeting in Malaysia
The UNESCO meeting has underlined that APEC’s privacy processes, while
important, are not the only regional development of significance
Asia-Pacific. Further UNESCO meetings may provide a good opportunity for
Asia-Pacific countries to debate matters outside
the APEC agenda, such as the
Montreux Declaration’s call for a UN treaty, and for the Council of Europe
to invite non-European
states to join its privacy treaty. Since the Asia-Pacific
has the only concentration of non-European states who could at this stage
parties to the CoE treaty, this debate must take place in the Asia-Pacific or be
consigned to irrelevance. UNESCO may provide
a valuable alternative forum for
such debate.
