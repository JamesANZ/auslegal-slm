APPLICATION:

REASONS EXCERPT
1. The Tribunal noted after introductions that there was an expectation, by
Mr Qadir and the treating team, that if Mr Qadir did not
want observing students
to be present during his review then they would be automatically excluded. The
President pointed out that
whether or not observers were present was a matter
for the Tribunal and directed that students be admitted (as it happened, the
had gone to lunch).
2. The President made remarks to the following effect to Mr Qadir on
this point:
It is really important to appreciate that this is an open hearing. It is
really important to appreciate that it’s a balance
between private
interests - your interests of your mental health and your continuing
rehabilitation - and public interests and that’s
why hearings are open.
You are protected by the fact that nobody can broadcast outside this room, what
they see or hear. Anybody
who walks out can’t do that outside. That
includes any students or press. [The President emphasizes that the press are
entitled to attend.] But what is really important for you to understand is
that there is a real public interest in many of these
cases, including yours,
because something very serious happened [many years ago, referring to the index
event]. It was a public event.
It is really important to understand that. And
there is a legitimate public interest in that. And also it is very important
hearings be open. That is partly for your benefit so that people can come
and see that patients are being treated well. It is also
for the benefit of
members of the public that they can see the processes; members of the public who
might be worried about things
or feel frightened. They can come in and sit in
and see what questions are asked. They can see, for example, Ms W who will be
questions of Dr A because the Minister is opposing the application. So
they can see that happen. It is a very important part of the
process and it is
very important to understand. Because I am a judge, I am also very fussy about
open court proceedings. This is
not a court, it is a Tribunal. But it is very
beneficial to have people able to come in and see proceedings. It is very
And it is good for you and a good thing. I respect your point of view,
but I don’t agree with it.
