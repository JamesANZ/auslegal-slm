International Law

law; techno-optimism; electric vehicles; bioenergy with carbon capture and
storage (BECCS).
1. Introduction
A colleague recently told me they were not
concerned about climate change because they felt they were doing their part.
They invested
in green funds, had recently bought an electric vehicle (EV) and
had installed solar panels on their home. There is a lot to unpack
here; their
statement reflects a common perspective many of us share – believing that
by taking individual actions and embracing
technological solutions, we
effectively contribute to addressing climate change. Like my colleague, many of
us are adopting ‘green’
technologies.
We do not dispute the
scientific consensus that human activities drive unprecedented changes in the
Earth’s climate.
acknowledge that, as temperatures rise, so do the risks of catastrophic events
such as extreme weather, sea-level rise and
biodiversity.
But we also believe
that new technological solutions will enable us to maintain the lifestyles we
are accustomed to without concern
It is even more troubling that this belief does not stop in our private
lives: it also influences policy and environmental governance
at national and
global levels. International (environmental)
has been shaped by this
narrative, with many of its sources and authorities emphasising the role of
technology as a key component
in strategies to address climate
For instance, the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issues reports outlining the
potential of technologies such as
carbon capture and storage to limit global
temperature rise.
Agreement explicitly acknowledges the importance of technology transfer and
innovation in achieving climate
Similarly, the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has established mechanisms to facilitate
the implementation of
climate technologies in developing
Relying solely on technological developments to address climate change is
insufficient, however. While technological innovations can
be part of the
solution to the climate crisis, believing that they can, by themselves, solve
the crisis is misguided. In this article,
I argue that technological
advancements will fall short of resolving the climate crisis without addressing
the underlying socioeconomic
structures that drive environmental degradation
– particularly a growth-dependent ideology. International law’s
of the narrative of technological optimism can render it blind to the
limitations of focusing solely on technology, overlooking the
structural changes in the current economic system. Many of the existing policies
aim to reduce emissions without requiring
major structural changes, attempting
to mask the broader problem and deferring effective action. In this respect, by
prioritising
technological solutions, international law risks underestimating
the importance of adopting a more holistic approach to implementing
measures aimed at transforming our socioeconomic system. This transformation is
crucial for an effective approach to climate
change and requires moving away
from the current individualistic perspective towards collective action and
systemic change.
To make my argument, I focus on two widely promoted technological solutions
to climate change: EVs and bioenergy with carbon capture
and storage (BECCS). At
first glance, both appear to be preventive or even reparative measures –
EVs by reducing reliance on
fossil fuel-powered vehicles and BECCS by removing
carbon from the atmosphere. However, as I argue, these technologies are best
as mitigation tools that reduce emissions without demanding
significant systemic change.
maintain the current car-dependent mobility model, whereas BECCS allows
high-emission industries to continue operating rather
than eliminating reliance
on fossil fuels. As such, these technologies show how climate policies focus on
mitigating damage rather
than addressing underlying causes. These two very
distinctive technologies were deliberately chosen. EVs represent consumer-driven
climate action, marketed to individuals as a means of contributing to
sustainability. BECCS is a large-scale intervention promoted
to policy-makers as
a breakthrough in emissions reduction. Despite their differences, both serve as
technological fixes that create
the illusion of change while allowing the
underlying structures that drive environmental degradation to persist. This
article calls
into question the idea that such mitigation-based solutions can
solve the climate crisis by themselves.
In section 2, I discuss the role of technology in international
(environmental) law, examining how international legal sources have
consistently
prioritised technological solutions in environmental governance. Section 3
dissects the allure of techno-optimism, scrutinising
the belief that technology
alone can lead to environmental sustainability. In section 4, I delve into two
specific technological
interventions – EVs and BECCS – to critique
their effectiveness and implications for sustainable practices. In section
explore the socioeconomics of techno-optimism, highlighting the contradictions
between growth-dependent economic systems and
the aims of environmental
sustainability. That section calls for a shift towards alternative narratives to
international law, suggesting
approaches that challenge the prevailing
growth-oriented paradigm and emphasise ecological strategies to address the
climate crisis.
I conclude the article in section 6.
2. Technology and International (Environmental) Law
Contemporary international law has evolved to address the regulatory
challenges posed by new technological advancements. One of the
international organisations, the International Telegraph
established in 1865,
exemplifies an early effort to regulate cross-border communication technologies.
In 1967, at the height of the
Cold War, the Outer Space Treaty emerged from the
optimistic assumption that humanity would soon have the potential to explore,
and colonise outer space – activities that would need
regulation.
Meanwhile, the 1968
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons highlighted the dangers of
technological developments in
The link between international environmental law and technological advances
is even more evident, as states have realised that technological
innovations
could pose very real transnational risks to the environment, thus demanding
unified action. The 1900 Convention for the
Preservation of Wild Animals, Birds
and Fish in Africa, for instance, was a response to advancements in firearms
technology, which
made hunting more efficient and thus could lead to the
exhaustion of game on the African
In 1959, the
Antarctic Treaty designated the continent as a preserve for scientific and
technological research.
Similarly, the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) addressed
technological advances in maritime resource extraction,
establishing guidelines
for sovereignty and the exploitation of ocean
In the last decades,
key developments in international environmental law have continued to link
environmental preservation with technological
advancements. The 1985 Vienna
Convention for the Protection of the Ozone
and the subsequent 1987
Montreal Protocol
phasing out ozone-depleting substances, encouraging technological cooperation
and promoting the transfer of environmentally
friendly technologies.
The 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (Rio 92) solidified
technology’s role in environmental governance. This
conference produced
the Rio Declaration on Environment and
Development,
led to the signing
of the UNFCCC and the Convention on Biological Diversity
and laid the groundwork
for the UN Convention to Combat Desertification
The agreements from
this conference underlined technology transfer as a crucial element for
achieving sustainable development. The
1997 Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC
introduced mechanisms such as the ‘clean development mechanism’,
fostering technology
transfer by allowing developed states to finance
emissions-reduction projects in developing states to meet their own emissions
The 2015 Paris Agreement takes a step further by introducing a technology
framework under Article 10, which aims to strengthen the
development and
transfer of technology to deal with climate change and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. The UN Sustainable Development

technology and environmental protection, notably through SDG 9, which promotes
industry, innovation and infrastructure,
and SDG 13, which calls for urgent
action to combat climate change and its impacts. Likewise, the 2023 Agreement on
the Conservation
and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas
Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement) brings attention to the
technology in environmental impact assessments, monitoring marine biodiversity
and ensuring effective management of marine
It further highlights the
importance of technology transfer to developing countries to enable their
participation in the efforts
to conserve the marine ecosystem.
Concerning transnational environmental litigation, as early as the
arbitration, there was an evident link between technological
developments and environmental
In this case, the
Canadian mining and smelting company claimed its technological advancements
would eliminate harmful sulphur dioxide
emissions. However, this promise proved
false, as sulphur dioxide levels along the Columbia River remained unchanged
from the previous
year, indicating no reduction in emissions. Locals, already
sceptical of the International Joint Commission’s strategy, grew
increasingly frustrated as the toxic smoke continued to damage their crops and
on the harmful effects of
sulphur dioxide at the time, they were deemed insufficient to form a substantial
scientific consensus.
Subsequent research confirmed that sulphur dioxide
emissions from the smelter were indeed responsible for the environmental damage,
validating the concerns of the
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has also addressed cases where
technology intersects with the environment. For instance,

The Court emphasised
the necessity of conducting thorough environmental impact assessments and
ongoing monitoring to mitigate potential
ecological damage. Similarly, in
Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros
, the ICJ examined the environmental
implications of dam construction technology on the Danube River, highlighting
the need for sustainable
development and the precautionary principle in
technological applications.
World Trade Organisation (WTO) Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) cases also
highlight intersections between technology, the environment
and public health.

shrimp be harvested using turtle excluder
technology.

The trend persists in the latest international decisions on environmental
matters. In the 2024

case, the European Court of Human
Rights (ECtHR) acknowledged the role of technological advancements in addressing
climate change,
highlighting that states have an obligation to implement these
innovations effectively in emission reduction and renewable
The Court examined
whether Switzerland had taken adequate measures, including the use of new
developing technologies, to limit its
greenhouse gas emissions and meet its
reduction targets, finding that Switzerland had failed to adequately assess and
implement necessary
measures, thus violating the European Convention on Human
Rights (ECHR), particularly the right to respect for private and family
In the 2023
, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR) also emphasised the
importance of technology in dealing with environmental
The Court ordered Peru
to develop and implement a comprehensive environmental remediation plan,
incorporating technology to monitor
air, water, and soil quality. Additionally,
the decision mandated that Peru ensure local operations comply with
international environmental
standards, employing technological advancements to
prevent and mitigate damages to the environment and human health. The role of
technology is also stressed in the 2024 Advisory Opinion on climate change
issued by the International Tribunal on the Law of the
ITLOS recognised that
modern technologies are crucial for accurately assessing and managing the health
of marine ecosystems. The
Advisory Opinion also emphasises the obligations of
appropriate assistance via capacity-building, scientific expertise and
transfer to ensure that vulnerable and developing states can access
the necessary tools to effectively protect their marine environments.
Although the paragraphs above have focused on the prevalence of a
technological focus in international law, it is important to recognise
appraisal for technology is not a universally held view. Some states support
alternative, non-technologically based strategies
that incorporate traditional
knowledge into their approach to environmental regulation. A prominent example
comes from the Pacific
Island states, whose diplomatic and legal stances often
contradict technologically driven solutions. Several small island developing
states (SIDS) – including Vanuatu, Tuvalu and Palau – have
emphasised the integration of Indigenous worldviews and the
cultural dimensions

These SIDS argue
that international law should encompass traditional ecological knowledge as
technological innovation alone cannot
protect the lives of underprivileged
Beyond the ICJ
proceedings, two examples of how SIDS approach environmental law differently are
found in the 2021 Pacific Islands
Forum Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones
and the 2023 Pacific Islands Forum Declaration on Statehood and Sea-Level Rise.
Emphasising
the need for legal stability, ecological integrity and cultural
continuity in international law, the 2021 declaration asserts that
marine zones
should remain fixed under UNCLOS despite rising sea
The 2023 declaration
reiterates the will of these nations to maintain statehood and marine rights
despite the challenges posed by
climate change-induced sea-level
These declarations clearly
highlight the importance SIDS place on safeguarding legal rights and cultural
heritage, thereby (at least
indirectly) challenging the prevailing
techno-centred perspective in international law. In this sense, even if
techno-centrism continues
to exert significant influence on contemporary
international law, it is essential to acknowledge that there are also views
the international community that prioritise other perspectives over
technological solutions.
There is nothing intrinsically wrong with expecting technological
advancements to contribute to environmental protection. Institutions
such as the
IPCC, the Climate Technology Centre and Network and the International Renewable
Energy Agency, for example, are conducting
essential work. The IPCC’s
reports are particularly relevant as they highlight the vital role of
technological developments
– such as renewable energy sources,
transitioning from fossil fuels and coal to more efficient energy systems and
carbon capture
and storage – in meeting the target of capping the global
temperature increase at 1.5°C (2.7ºF) above preindustrial
The problem arises with
an overreliance on technology, where new technological developments are awaited
with undue optimism. This
dependence may lead policy-makers to believe they can
postpone decisive action today, assuming that imminent technological
advancements
will resolve all environmental challenges tomorrow. Such a belief
perpetuates a dangerous cycle of inaction, with major socioeconomic
being continually deferred in anticipation of a miraculous technological fix.
This allure influences not only politicians
but also those involved in
technological development, who may believe their innovations alone can rectify
the systemic issues driving
The next section delves
deeper into the origins of the techno-optimist narrative.

Techno-optimism is an ideology based on the belief that technological
advances lead to a better life and can even lead to a utopian

dangers and overlooked issues. The next section continues the analysis

4. The Underside of Techno-Optimism
The techno-optimist narrative is unmistakably
Western-centric.
This is already
evident in the framing of the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution, which
sidelines the developmental status
of other regions of the globe. The discourse
of post-war optimism – a period that some refer to as the ‘golden
capitalism’
only serves to highlight this bias. Depicting it as a stage of technological and
economic progress largely ignores several
non-Western regions’
socio-political realities and cultural climates. For instance, many African
countries were still embroiled
in political struggles and armed conflicts for
independence from colonial rulers. Families in Algeria, Angola, Congo, Kenya,
and Zanzibar faced a significantly different situation than the average

are often ignored or
dismissed in the techno-optimist narrative. The pursuit of technological fixes
to sustain Western lifestyles
frequently results in an oversight of the negative
impacts associated with these technologies. This frantic search for
technological
solutions blinds the West to the broader consequences of its
consumption patterns and perpetuates a cycle of exploitation and environmental
harm in which the cost of maintaining such lifestyles is borne
disproportionately by non-Western regions, which endure the brunt
environmental degradation and human rights abuses resulting from resource
extraction and technological
production.
In this section, I examine two technologies often hailed as promising
solutions to climate change, offering the possibility of continuing
lifestyles without significant changes to our behaviour or consumption patterns.
The first is the EV, widely adopted to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from
transportation (section 4.1). The second is BECCS, endorsed by various official
sources as essential
for mitigating climate change and achieving net-zero
emissions (section 4.2).
4.1 Electric Vehicles
One of the most emblematic technologies in combating climate change is the
EV, which provides a consumer-friendly approach to addressing
the environmental
crisis. EVs promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while letting people
indulge in the comfort and luxury to
which they are accustomed: owning one or
more vehicles per household. From the consumer’s perspective, it is a
save the planet while preserving their lifestyle. Official
environmental initiatives also seem to subscribe to the hopes placed in
instance, the ‘European Green Deal’ explicitly mentions EVs as a
part of a sustainable mobility strategy for
the EU to become climate neutral by
The IPCC’s 2023
Climate Change Report also addresses EVs as a means of mitigating climate change
in the transport sector.
Likewise, the IPCC’s Climate Change 2022 Report discusses integrating EVs
within the renewable energy sources framework as
a way to reduce
transport-related emissions.
EVs are regarded as a sustainable alternative to traditional internal
combustion engine vehicles. Their primary advantage lies in
their potential to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are a major contributor to global warming
and climate change. EVs can operate
with zero tailpipe emissions by using
electric power from batteries.
As such, the adoption of EVs can significantly decrease the reliance on fossil
fuels. Traditional internal combustion engine vehicles
run primarily on gasoline
or diesel, both of which contribute to air pollution and pose risks related to
their extraction, such as
oil spills and habitat
destruction.
In contrast, EVs
can be powered by electricity generated from various sources, including
renewable energy options such as solar,
wind and hydroelectric
Such an optimistic view of EVs overlooks several downsides,

4.2 Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage
Another technology lauded as promising in the fight against climate change is
BECCS, which promises to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
atmosphere.
A BECCS system
starts by producing energy from burning biomass (crop residues, forest residues,
or dedicated energy crops). During
this process, carbon dioxide is produced, but
in a BECCS system, the carbon is captured before it can escape into the
through special technologies designed to trap the carbon dioxide gas.
Once captured, carbon dioxide is transported and stored underground
geological formations or old oil and gas fields, thus preventing carbon dioxide
from entering the atmosphere.
Article 4 of the Paris Agreement encourages the development and deployment of
carbon removal technologies (which include BECCS) as
part of a suite of
strategies to achieve the goal of capping the global temperature increase. The
Agreement also requires states
to submit their nationally determined
contributions, outlining their plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Many
states include
BECCS in their plans as mitigation strategies, with the Energy
Futures Initiative (EFI) dedicating a large portion of its 2022 report
analysing the BECCS industrial landscape in the United
BECCS is also
extensively mentioned in IPCC reports as a critical component of climate change
mitigation. In the Special Report on
Global Warming of 1.5°C, the IPCC
mentions BECCS in the context of the carbon dioxide-removal technologies that
are needed to
achieve net negative
Similarly, the IPCC
Special Report on Climate Change and Land discusses the implications of
large-scale BECCS deployment as an instrument
to mitigate climate change and
addresses the potential need to change land-use
In the recent 2023
Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, the IPCC includes BECCS within various
strategies to mitigate climate
change, underscoring its role alongside other
negative emission technologies as a possible instrument to meet the more
climate targets.
A significant criticism that can be made against BECCS concerns its
scalability and the sustainability of biomass
production.
Delivering BECCS at
the scale required to meet global climate targets involves substantial land
Estimates suggest that an
additional 300–600 million hectares of land would be needed for
energy crop production (for comparison,
the total land area of the EU is around
400 million hectares). This represents a considerable shift in land use,
equivalent to about
40 per cent of current global arable land. Such a
large-scale conversion would necessarily lead to deforestation, loss of
biodiversity
and competition with food production, raising concerns about land
Moreover, the logistics
of transporting and processing vast amounts of biomass, along with the
construction of the necessary infrastructure
for carbon capture and storage,
present further challenges.
Existing infrastructure does not support widespread carbon dioxide transport and
storage, and building this infrastructure would
require massive investment and
international cooperation. These economic and technical barriers make the
large-scale deployment of
BECCS highly uncertain and potentially unfeasible
within the time limits necessary to meet climate
The effectiveness of BECCS in achieving genuine net negative emissions is
still uncertain due to the complexities of the entire supply
chain, from biomass
production to carbon storage.
For instance, the type of biomass used can significantly impact the overall
emissions balance. Life-cycle assessment studies show
significant variability in
emissions reductions depending on the specific supply chain configurations and
assumptions made.
questions about the long-term monitoring and verification of carbon storage and
the potential risks of leakage, which would
undermine the benefits of BECCS. If
leakage occurs, it could release significant amounts of carbon dioxide back into
the atmosphere,
negating carbon capture
An example of this
risk is the In Salah carbon dioxide storage project in Algeria, where concerns
to pressure build-up led to a temporary halt in
operations.
political hazards are also associated with relying on BECCS, as it might reduce
the urgency for immediate emission reductions

sectors. If policy-makers perceive BECCS as a solution to climate change, they
might delay necessary

transportation and manufacturing, leading to a prolonged period of high
5. From ‘Innovate or Die’ to ‘Coexist or
In the previous section, I discussed technologies that have been presented as
solutions to climate change, highlighting their limitations.
While EVs and BECCS
are marketed as sustainable technologies, they come with environmental
trade-offs that complicate their real
effectiveness. These technologies do not
fully address the structural problems driving climate change, and in some cases
create new problems. However, beyond these imperfect solutions there
are also technologies that, despite their growing popularity,
are actively
detrimental to climate efforts. These technologies attract enormous investment
and enthusiasm, yet their environmental
impact is often overlooked, as they are
developed and deployed without sufficient regard for their planetary footprint.
As noted in section 3, blockchain-based cryptocurrencies epitomise certain
contemporary techno-libertarian ideals, promising a decentralised
ecosystem beyond the reach of traditional banks and governments. Despite this
rhetoric, the mining process for cryptocurrencies
such as Bitcoin (and until
recently Ethereum)

Consequently,
the net effect is to shift the environmental burden to areas already grappling

such, even incremental hardware and software improvements on efficiency may fail
to keep pace with the rapid expansion of large-scale
AI projects and their
energy expenditure.
Regardless of whether we are discussing EVs, BECCS, blockchain or AI, the
tendency to overlook the environmental impact of these technologies
highlights a
broader trend in technological development—one that prioritises innovation
and market adoption over true sustainability.
These micro-level examples of
technological developments have illustrated how techno-enthusiasm can sideline
deeper ecological concerns.
In what follows (section 5.1), I shift to a macro
perspective, arguing that the hopes vested in new technologies to tackle climate
change result from our present socioeconomic system and its connection to growth
and innovation. I then proceed (section 5.2) to
explore an alternative
ecological narrative, challenging the dominant assumption that continued
economic growth and environmental
protection can coexist.
5.1 The Socioeconomics of Techno-Optimism
Our current socioeconomic system is growth-dependent, a notion that can be
summarised by the ‘innovate or die’
This dependency is
not a by-product but a fundamental prerequisite for the stability and
continuation of the system. Capitalism thrives
on the continual expansion of
production, consumption and profit. Without consistent growth, capitalist
economies risk severe crises

ideas, particularly his concept of ‘creative destruction’, are
critical to this growth-centric

identified the ‘visionary entrepreneur’ as the central figure in
this process, constantly
seeking competitive advantages to outpace
The ‘innovate or die’ mentality has become deeply embedded in our
contemporary ideology, underpinned by the belief that
technological progress is
synonymous with economic prosperity. Schumpeter’s theories were later
expanded to emphasise the systemic
nature of innovation, highlighting the
importance of creating environments conducive to technological advancement
through interactions
between public and private
institutions.
perspective, innovation drives economic growth and stretches the limits imposed
by resource scarcity.
However, the relentless pursuit of innovation and growth often overlooks the
nature of technological development and its broader
implications. The focus on
techno-optimist beliefs that technological progress is inevitable, and that
increased productivity is
inherently beneficial has normalised the notion that
continuous economic expansion is natural.
Growth dependency is a hallmark of capitalist economies and a driving force
that shapes policies, organisational strategies and societal
perpetuates a cycle that prioritises economic expansion at the expense of all
other considerations.
dependency on growth couples with techno-optimism in expecting that any problem
– including climate change – can
and should be solved by
technological innovation.
Such expectations are unequivocally evident in the OECD’s publications. In
the 2011 report on promoting technological innovation
to address climate change,
the organisation states that ‘Technological change is undoubtedly one of
the keys to ensuring that
climate change can be addressed without compromising
economic growth.’
its 2023 outlook on science, technology and innovation, the OECD states that
‘Without a major acceleration in low-carbon
innovation, reaching
net‐zero emissions by 2050 will be
unachievable.’
spirit inhabits the OECD’s 2024 report on anticipatory governance for
emerging technology: ‘Emerging technologies
can contribute to
unprecedented gains in health, energy, climate, food systems, and
biodiversity.’
The major issue is that these techno-optimist narratives fail to address the
deep-rooted values and the politics of unsustainability
that shape contemporary
societies. As Blühdorn argues, modern eco-political practices are more
of ‘sustained unsustainability’ than
genuinely transforming societal values and
behaviours.
The emphasis on
technology as a solution enables societies to avoid confronting uncomfortable
truths about our behaviour. This faith
in technological fixes perpetuates the
idea that we can maintain our current lifestyles and economic models without
significant changes
to our consumption patterns or societal
It suggests that the
crisis can be managed without addressing the systemic drivers of ecological
destruction. The OECD’s publications
clearly reflect the secondary
position given to behavioural change: ‘Reaching this [net-zero emissions]
target requires rapid
large-scale deployment of available technologies ... as
well as the development and widespread use of technologies that are far from
mature today ... It also requires behavioural
Note how the
need for behavioural change is acknowledged, but presented almost as an
afterthought, a secondary consideration to be
addressed besides ongoing
technological development.
In this respect, an important distinction must be made between different
technological approaches to environmental governance: prevention,
reparation and
mitigation.
Prevention is
grounded in an anticipatory rationale, requiring due diligence and the
implementation of proactive measures with a
broad ecological scope to safeguard
the environment in its
Prevention requires
systemic changes that eliminate environmental harm before it occurs – such
as shifting away from car-dependent
Reparation deals
with harm that has already been inflicted. It includes legal mechanisms such as
environmental liability laws, financial
compensation for affected communities
and large-scale ecological restoration
Reparation can take
the form of funding for climate adaptation in vulnerable regions, land
restoration or even reparative action
for communities displaced by environmental
While reparation
acknowledges past harm, it does not necessarily prevent its recurrence, and in
some cases it can lead to scenarios
where damage is compensated for but the
underlying causes remain
Mitigation seeks to reduce the damage caused by ongoing activities without
fundamentally altering them. This is where the vast majority
of policies have
been concentrated.
clear example: rather than questioning our dependency on cars, they offer a
cleaner alternative that still enables mass
car ownership, transport
infrastructure expansion and resource-intensive production. BECCS is another
clear example of mitigation.
While at first glance it might seem to align with
reparation, as it removes carbon from the atmosphere, its primary function is
to address past emissions but rather to enable the continuation of
high-emission industries with minimal disruption. So, rather than
transforming
the energy system, BECCS attempts to justify the persistence of our reliance on
fossil fuels. The same logic applies
to the financial sector, as financiers
promote ‘green’ financial products while continuing to finance
harmful industries,
maintaining the very economic structures that drive
environmental degradation.
Almost all climate policies that have been implemented – and remain in
force – have shared this same core objective:
mitigate emissions without
requiring major systemic
They seek to make
activities less harmful, but they do not challenge the underlying logic of
endless economic growth and consumption.
As a result, they allow the crisis to
be masked rather than solved, continually deferring responsibility to future
generations while
ensuring the status quo remains untouched.
The mainstream eco-political discourse focuses more on mitigating the visible
symptoms of unsustainability than addressing its root
causes. In other words,
contemporary environmental practices tend to perpetuate the politics of
unsustainability, prioritising short-term
stability over the profound
sociocultural transformation needed for true ecological
sustainability.
As such, the
current mainstream discourse on sustainability has become a means to perpetuate
the socioeconomic
without substantial structural
transformation. Sustainable development policies often focus on technological
solutions and market-based
mechanisms that allow for continued economic growth
under the guise of environmental
responsibility.
This approach
avoids confronting the fundamental paradox of a growth-dependent system
operating within finite ecological limits.
Techno-optimism is a clear symptom of
this paradox.
While techno-optimist narratives provide hope for a seamless transition to
sustainability through innovation, they ultimately fail
to challenge the
underlying problems causing the climate crisis. In the same way, by neglecting
to consider the root causes of the
crisis, such as capitalism’s growth
imperative, international law risks perpetuating the very structures that drive
change. Technological advancements undoubtedly offer tools that can
mitigate some of the adverse effects of climate change; however,
innovations are insufficient on their own to address the full scope of the
environmental challenges we face. Technological
solutions focus on improving
efficiency within the current economic system rather than transforming the
system itself. This approach
leads to the continuation of the politics of
sustained unsustainability, where the underlying drivers of environmental
degradation
remain unchallenged.
5.2 Towards an Ecological Narrative
Without challenging these socioeconomic drivers, efforts to mitigate climate
change will remain insufficient. While detailed solutions
lie beyond the scope
of this article, it is essential to highlight alternative approaches within
international law, such as post-growth
approaches, which call for rethinking
economic systems.
approaches advocate shifting away from relentless growth to tackle root causes
of the crisis rather than relying exclusively
on technological solutions. An
ecological narrative within post-growth offers a different perspective on our
relationship with the
environment, challenging individualistic notions that
separate us from our
surroundings.
An ecological
narrative invites us to consider how our actions resonate within the larger
context of the biosphere
to understand that our individual stories are part of a much larger ecological
Being ecological is not
just being ‘green’; it means moving beyond self-centred views to
embrace a holistic understanding
of our place in the world. Shifting from an
individualistic, technology-reliant view to an ecological narrative means
recognising
humans as integral parts of the ecological web, deeply intertwined
with the non-human world. So, instead of ‘innovate or die’,
consider ‘coexist or collapse’.
There is a critical distinction between superficial engagement with nature in
individualistic narratives and the deeper engagement
an ecological narrative
demands. Individualistic narratives focus on personal experiences or
achievements, centring on the individual’s
perspective. In contrast,
ecological thought recognises the multiple voices and experiences within the
ecological narrative.
personal commitment to ‘green’ technologies is commendable but it
invites deeper reflection, as it may reflect an underlying
belief that
individual efforts and technological solutions alone are sufficient. A notion
that ‘I am doing my part, so I need
not be concerned with anything
else’ encapsulates a tendency to address global issues
individualistically, neglecting the necessity
of collective action. In this
context, an ecological narrative challenges the assumption that we can buy our
way out of environmental
crises through ‘green’ technologies.
Instead, it emphasises the importance of fundamentally rethinking our
relationship
with the planet. This narrative calls on us to acknowledge our
intrinsic interconnectedness, recognising that we cannot separate
ourselves from
the environment – there is no ‘nature’ independent of
As participants in a
shared world, addressing climate change requires collective responsibility
alongside individual efforts.
In international law, an ecological narrative would emphasise the limitations
of relying solely on individual actions and technological
solutions, while also
uncovering deeper issues, such as the dependence on perpetual economic growth.
The prevailing focus on individual
responsibility reinforces an outlook that
obscures the structural and systemic dimensions of environmental
In this context, a
continued reliance on techno-optimism avoids addressing the growth-driven
ideology that underpins environmental
harm. The institutional promotion of
‘green’ technologies often serves as a distraction from more
fundamental issues,
such as the structural incentives that drive
over-consumption, resource exploitation and environmental deregulation. By
placing the
burden of environmental responsibility on individuals, governments
and corporations deflect attention from the systemic forces that

industrial practices and weak enforcement of

Consequently, current
approaches risk overlooking the socioeconomic drivers of environmental harm and
undervaluing the importance

reductions and encourage systemic behavioural changes. Without structural
changes, the
emphasis on individual action remains insufficient, and in many
cases counterproductive.
genuine ecological approach would move beyond consumer-based solutions and
challenge the institutional frameworks that perpetuate
environmental harm,
ensuring that international law prioritises legally binding commitments leading
to systemic transformations for
sustainability.
International law would need to move beyond an emphasis on economic growth
and sustainable development to pursue true sustainability

ecological integrity and collective well-being. Achieving this shift entails
adopting alternative economic metrics
that mirror ecological health and social
equity, rather than merely reflecting gross economic

Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)

Including such
metrics in international law could assist practitioners in steering the law

that ‘progress’ no longer

interests of the
Moving away from a top-down approach, international law should address

this approach, as it permits local

that validate these perspectives could strengthen environmental governance by

formal legal frameworks.
worldviews offer a corrective lens to dominant perspectives that prioritise
economic goals over ecological integrity.
Another key aspect of proposed international law reforms concerns the
strengthening of legal powers to hold businesses accountable
for environmental
damage. At present, many international mechanisms depend on voluntary codes of
conduct or weak enforcement, effectively
enabling businesses to pass on
ecological costs.
ecological perspective on international law would therefore need a shift towards
binding obligations that compel corporations
to fully account for the
environmental repercussions of their operations. For instance, the EU’s
Corporate Sustainability Due
could illustrate
this approach by requiring companies to identify and mitigate environmental and
human rights risks throughout their
supply chains. Likewise, France’s Duty
of Vigilance Law (2017)
places legal responsibilities on large corporations to prevent environmental and
social harm, with potential liability in case of
inaction. Germany’s
Supply Chain Due Diligence Act
similarly mandates
corporate accountability for environmental and human rights violations in supply
chains, prompting firms to adopt
more sustainable practices.
Broadening legal liability for environmental damage – exemplified by
the concept of ecocide, currently under discussion as a
potential international
crime – could intensify corporate accountability. The Stop Ecocide
Foundation, together with the Pacific
Island nations of Vanuatu, Fiji and Samoa,
have been advocating for the possibility of recognising ecocide as a fifth core
under the Rome Statute,
signalling a growing commitment to criminalising large-scale environmental
destruction.
Notably, Belgium
has incorporated ecocide into its penal code, making it one of the first states
to impose criminal penalties for
grave ecological
while Brazil
contemplates new legislation aimed at holding corporations criminally
accountable for deforestation and environmental
degradation.
Strengthening
laws on environmental liability and expanding judicial mechanisms – such
as through the prospective UN Binding
Treaty on Business and Human
– could equip
international law with the necessary tools to foster a genuinely ecological
model of corporate responsibility,
prompting businesses to safeguard the
environment rather than simply pay for damage after the fact.
In essence, an ecological approach to international law calls for a
fundamental reorientation of the international legal framework.
Moving beyond
growth-centred perspectives, engaging local communities, integrating traditional
ecological knowledge, and imposing
meaningful liability on corporations for
environmental harms would enable international law to more effectively address
the climate
crisis. In the absence of these structural changes, international
law risks enabling the very socioeconomic systems that perpetuate
environmental
degradation, rather than steering us towards any real solutions.
6. Final Remarks
Rachel Carson’s
Silent Spring
, one of the most influential
environmentalist books ever written, serves not only as a manifesto for an
ecological approach to addressing
the impact of human activities on our planet
but also as a cautionary tale about the unintended consequences of new
technologies.
She focuses on the harmful effects of pesticides used in
agriculture – technologies that were designed to enhance productivity
that carry substantial risks to both the environment and human health. Carson
argues that these innovations, though promising
immediate benefits, threaten the
delicate balance of ecosystems. In this context, in the last chapter of her
book, she remarks:
We stand now where two roads diverge. But unlike the roads in Robert
Frost’s familiar poem, they are not equally fair. The road
we have long
been traveling is deceptively easy, a smooth superhighway on which we progress
with great speed, but at its end lies
disaster. The other fork of the road
– the one “less traveled by” – offers our last, our only
chance to reach
a destination that assures the preservation of the
Carson’s poignant observation remains as relevant today as it was in
1962. We stand at a crossroads, faced with a choice between
the deceptive ease
of technological solutions and the more challenging path of systemic
socioeconomic change. The road of techno-optimism
is alluring because it
promises that we can maintain our current lifestyles without making substantial
sacrifices. However, this
path leads to a future where the root causes of
environmental degradation remain unaddressed, and the consequences of climate
become increasingly severe. The narrative that technological advancements
alone can solve the climate crisis is a dangerous one.
As highlighted throughout
this article, while technology can mitigate environmental degradation, it is not
a panacea. The reliance
on technology as a primary solution to climate change
overlooks the systemic issues inherent in our socioeconomic structures,
particularly
the growth-dependent nature of capitalism.
International law has persisted in prioritising technological innovation.
From early regulatory efforts to contemporary sources, there
is a clear emphasis
on technology transfer, investment and development. While these measures are
essential, they must be complemented
by strong regulatory frameworks, changes to
consumption and production patterns and a structural transformation of our
economic systems.
In this respect, this article does not oppose technological
innovation; instead, it critiques the reliance on technology alone to
climate crisis. A modest form of techno-optimism, guided by a post-growth
approach and an ecological narrative may indeed
acceptable.
Unfortunately,
the mainstream eco-political discourse in international law often falls into the
trap of strong techno-optimism, thus
perpetuating the politics of sustained
unsustainability, where systemic issues are managed rather than resolved.
I must also acknowledge my own tendency towards an individualistic
perspective. By referring to international law in the third person,
removed myself from the equation, failing to recognise that international law
results from the actions of international actors,
including international law
academics like me. We are responsible for changing international law; it will
not change on its own –
that will only occur if we start with ourselves.
While the degree of influence varies, international legal practitioners,
and researchers are responsible for critically approaching their own
practice. We must question whether our staunch support of new
technologies can
solve the world’s problems. If we conclude – as I have – that
it cannot, we must ask what steps
we need to take to effect meaningful
We must move beyond a narrow focus on technological solutions and embrace a
different strategy. We must evolve the law to prioritise
changes in our
socioeconomic system, ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come. As
legal practitioners, educators, and
researchers, it is incumbent upon us to
adopt a self-reflective
We need to be more
critical of technology, wary of its promises, and recognise our responsibility
in shaping legal frameworks that
address the structural complexities of the
climate crisis. By doing so, we can move beyond individualistic perspectives and
collectively toward systemic changes that genuinely contribute to solving
these pressing global issues. The road less travelled,
though challenging,
offers our last and only chance to avoid mass extinction.

In this article, any reference
to ‘international law’ should be understood as also referring to
specific the instruments
of international environmental law. I treat
international environmental law as a special regime within the broader field of
international law, consistent with the view set out by the International
Law Commission’s Fragmentation of International Law.
On the relationship
between general international law and special regimes, see Marcos, “Two
Kinds of Systemic Consistency in
International Law” and Marcos,
“From Fragmented Legal Order to Globalised Legal System.”
It is important to note that
not all international law instruments or practices embrace a purely
techno-optimist stance. In this
article, references to techno-optimism within
international law focus on a prevalent trend rather than a universal position
not discount alternative approaches to the discipline (which will be
discussed in sections 2 and 5).

Sources often use varying
terminology or group these three approaches to environmental governance
together. For example, the US Federal
Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)
provides a broad definition of mitigation, which can encompass elements of
prevention and
even reparation. So, I am not using these terms as universally
adopted categories, but as analytical distinctions to differentiate
clearly distinct strategies of environmental governance. CEQ, Definition of
Mitigation.
