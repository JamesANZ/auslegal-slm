This decision concerns an application by the Westscheme Pty Ltd (Westscheme) to vary the
Broadcasting and Recorded Entertainment Award 2010
(the modern award) to include Westscheme as a default superannuation fund in cl.22.4.
Our decision of 2 September 2009
indicated that we considered that there are two grounds upon which a fund could be considered for inclusion in a modern award; where
the fund was nominated as a default fund in an award-based transitional instrument relevant to the coverage of the modern award (e.g.
a Notional Agreement Preserving a State Award (NAPSA) or a federal award) or where the representatives of the main parties consented.
This application to vary is made on the ground that Westscheme is nominated as a default superannuation fund in a Western Australian
Clerks (Commercial Radio and Television Broadcasters) Award of 1970
(the WA NAPSA). It argued that this constitutes a recognised ground for the inclusion of Westscheme in the modern award.
The coverage of the WA NAPSA extends to only clerical classifications. That coverage will be subsumed by the
Clerks Private Sector Award 2010
The coverage of the modern award, however, does not extend to clerical classifications. Consequently the requirement that the WA
NAPSA be relevant to the coverage of the modern award for which the variation is sought is not met.
The application is refused.
