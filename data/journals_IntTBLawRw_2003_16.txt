Investing in China
intends to study the legal, business and cultural
considerations for foreign, and particularly Australian, investment in China.
the author, argues that the most effective business structure for
investment in China is the joint venture, and supports this argument
analysis of the taxation, management, marketing and financial consequences in an
historical, cultural and legal setting. However,
she also carefully incorporates
the possibility of variant purposes of foreign investment, and evaluates
different types of business
structures pursuant to these same criteria.
Therefore, she has also provided a useful guidebook for anyone interested in
In her second chapter, Wei outlines China’s economic reform programme
and its emergence into a market-driven economy. She emphasises
strategic importance, both political and economic. She also discusses the most
viable regions for investment. In discussing
the policies and practices of China
in relation to foreign investment, she highlights the desirability of China as
an investment
venue. In addition, she indicates that China is an important
target of Australian foreign investment due to its proximity and economic
potential. However, previous investments have generally been under-performing.
The author identifies the reasons for this as lack
of understanding of Chinese
consumers of distribution and retail structure, operational inefficiency and
inappropriate choice of
business structure.
The major part of the book is aimed at discussing the relevant concerns in
choosing a business structure. Wei identifies these structures
as equity and
contractual joint ventures, wholly foreign owned enterprises, branches of
foreign businesses in China, and other types
of investment vehicles such as
technology transfers and compensation trades. In future editions it is suggested
that she should incorporate
a more detailed analysis of the cultural and social
aspects of China, which she emphasises as the main pitfall for investors.
This reviewer found certain chapters to be of particular interest. In Chapter
3, Wei discusses the Chinese legal system and legal
framework for foreign
investment. Here she is concerned to highlight China’s growing stability,
the development of the rule
of law and the safety of investing in China. In
Chapter 4, she discusses China’s protection of intellectual property,
emphasising China’s stability and legal security. Chapter 9
discusses China’s dispute resolution procedures, these being
arbitration and the legal process, explaining China’s court system. In
this forum, the author also discusses the
role of international law, and
conflict of laws to which the parties to a dispute must submit or may choose to
Finally, the book is concerned with investigating the relevant concerns of a
foreign investor: business structure, taxation consequences,
management and
marketing and the deployment of profits and capital. In this respect, the title
is a misnomer. Wei does not investigate
the law and practice only of joint
ventures, but the law and practice of foreign investment. Joint ventures are
merely the most efficient
and predominant structure of foreign investment in
In Chapters 5–8, the author addresses matters of concern to investors.
In discussing business structure, she highlights China’s
encouragement of
joint ventures. However, she usefully identifies the advantages and
disadvantages of each investment structure in
overall terms. The joint venture
in China has a different status to that of a joint venture in Australia; in
particular, it can be
a legal entity and therefore it can have limited
liability. In other chapters, she discusses the advantages and disadvantages for
each business structure in specific terms, relating to taxation benefits and
consequences, issues of control and laws relating to
repatriation and remittance
of profits.
Wei has thus written a useful guidebook for investors interested in China.
Her main concern is to highlight China’s desirability
as a destination for
investment, but also to indicate the necessity of considering different
cultural, social and legal systems in
evaluating investment choices. Her work is
easy to read and she provides a very useful table in her conclusion, which
reiterates,
in summary form, the conclusions she has reached about each of the
business structures.
Federation Press should be congratulated on the publication of this useful
text. It is especially important that Australian legal
publishers continue to
focus on Asian law.
