Navigating the labyrinth
By Bruce Hodgkinson AM SC and Emily Aitken
The work we do has a profound impact on our lives, and particularly so when
things go wrong. Many people’s lives are impacted
by injury or illness
– mental or physical – sustained at or because of work. Tragically,
there are those for whom a workplace
incident will have life altering or ending
consequences.
The response of the legal system to illnesses and injuries (and deaths) that
occur at or in connection with work is not straightforward.
It requires
engagement with the interests of a diverse group of stakeholders, often with
competing interests and varying levels of
resources, education and
sophistication when it comes to interacting with the legal system. The
structures established by the legal
system to address workplace wrongs can also
draw in a variety of influential non-party actors including technical experts,
professionals, family members, carers and insurers.
In this edition:
offers a comprehensive and practical overview of the
Commonwealth workers’ compensation regime, administered pursuant to the
Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988
(Cth). Ray provides a
particularly useful summary of what, and when, illnesses and injuries (both
physical and psychological) will
be compensable under that Act. Ray encourages
legal practitioners to consider resuming or commencing practice in this
and engaging area in which to practice.’
Greg Spinda
provides his analysis of the trends in mental injuries
– both primary and secondary – emerging from the Final Report
the 2023 review of the Queensland workers’ compensation scheme.
Greg’s experience in practice, and his advocacy
in this space, inform his
pithy observations regarding the challenges (and their underlying causes) in
respect of managing mental
injury claims, and the policy measures and practical
steps that can be taken to meaningfully meet those challenges.
Similarly, in his analysis of the amendments to the
Workplace Injury
Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (WorkCover Scheme Modernisation) Bill
Joseph Ridley
provides a critique of the significant
amendments proposed by the Bill which he points out limit compensation for all
psychiatric
injuries. Joseph argues that the amendments are intended to cut
costs at the expense of worker entitlements.
Standing in contrast to the complexities of the legal frameworks and systems
described by Greg and Ray,
Mylinda Purtell
provides a hopeful account of
the pro bono service provided by Worker Assist Tasmania – a free and
independent advisory service
for individuals requiring assistance in navigating
the Tasmanian workers’ compensation system. Fully funded by the WorkCover
Board of Tasmania, Mylinda describes the positive outcomes that Worker Assist
creates for workers, law firms (by assisting individuals
in assessing whether
they have a claim and, if so, refining it), employers and insurers, and the role
it plays in identifying and
raising systemic issues with the WorkCover Board of
Mark Dohrmann AM
, professional engineer and certified ergonomist,
shares his perspective on how the discipline of ergonomics – which Mark
as the study of ‘human factors’ – can and should be
used early on in a case, including when assessing and developing
a claim. Mark
argues that engaging an expert on an ‘open brief’ can allow the
expert to bring their expertise to bear
on the full scope of the case, not just
in respect of the narrow set of questions that may be posed in a request for an
expert report
or opinion.
Finally, tracing his own family history of silicosis,
Vaughan Hager
canvasses the landmark decision reached on 13 December 2023 by the Commonwealth,
state and territory governments to ban the use,
supply and manufacture of
engineered stone in Australia. Vaughan provides a detailed overview of the
framework established in New
South Wales under the
Dust Diseases Tribunal Act
(NSW) for the hearing and determination of dust disease claims by the
Dust Diseases Tribunal and the unique legal doctrines and principles
given rise to.
The profound effect on workplace injuries and illnesses on a worker’s
life must always remain a focus for policymakers and practitioners
alike. We are
fortunate to have these poignant contributions from experienced legal and other
practitioners, who have a deep understanding
and appreciation of this important
consideration.
