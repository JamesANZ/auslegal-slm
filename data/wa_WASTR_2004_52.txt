8 The parcel is known as "Bluegum Corner" and is situated at 35 Burbridge

9 The parcel is an 8-lot residential development with frontages to Burbridge
Avenue, Shelvock Crescent, Varcoe Road and Callison
10 Lots 1, 2, 3 and 4 are in one group of buildings and Lots 5, 6, 7 and 8 are

Applicant's submissions
15 The proprietor of Lot 2 is Corry Johnathon Maas who has been the owner of
Lot 2 since 28 January 2004. According to the Applicant,
he has been in
occupation since February "2003" but this is obviously a typographical
16 The Applicant states that the Respondent, aged 18, is unable to live in a
strata-titled property because of his lack of respect
for his neighbours.
17 The scheme is managed for the Strata Company by Strata Personal Management.
That firm has recently taken over management from
John Dethridge & Co.
18 On 16 February 2004, the owner and occupier of a lot adjacent to the
Respondent's Lot 2 wrote to John Dethridge & Co advising
that although the
Respondent had only moved into Lot 2 three weeks earlier, the complainant had
been subjected to disgusting anti-social
behaviour, foul language and misconduct
from Lot 2.
19 Another lot proprietor wrote on 17 February 2004, including in their
"We are writing this letter of complaint in response to the behaviour exhibited
by residents of Unit 2... Over the past few weeks
we have been exposed to
excessively loud music and yelling of profane/abusive language at all hours. ...
This behaviour is offensive
and disruptive to our lifestyle – for example,
we are unable to sleep, open our windows or entertain guests
20 On 18 February 2004, John Dethridge & Co wrote to Mr Maas advising of
those complaints and quoting Sch 1 by-laws 1(2) and
Sch 2 by-law 12.
21 The letter pointed out Mr Maas' obligation under the
by-laws and requested urgent compliance with them.
22 However, when the complaints continued, attempts were made, through the
Respondent's mother and stepfather, to obtain his cooperation.
23 On 3 May 2004, the proprietor of an adjoining lot wrote to Strata Personal
Management, the then Strata Managers, stating, in
"I have lost count of the times that Corry has been on my doorstep apologising
and telling me he is only 18 years of
24 I have been advised that he continues to breach the by-laws.
25 Other lot proprietors also wrote on 3 May 2004 reiterating the complaints
friends and citing as an
"Friday night 30
April 2004. The abovementioned were in the street
between 1.30am and 2.30am making a lot of noise by riding a bike with no tyres,
also yelling and talking loudly to each other, which woke our youngest child.
... This is just one of many occasions where excessive
noise has come from their
property such as slamming of doors, loud music and glass bottles being thrown
onto the road..."
26 Another lot proprietor has also complained of
"loud music, street drinking, foul
and has listed occasions when the police and the local government have been
27 Similar complaints have been made by others. One has advised that one of her
children, a student, has had to move to a relative's
to be able to study in peace.
28 On 5 May 2004, Strata Personal Services wrote to the Respondent summarising
these complaints and pointing out his obligations.
29 The lot proprietors have reported that on 4 June 2004 there was another
incident involving loud abusive language, screaming and
yelling by a group of
approximately 15 young people, who were reportedly weilding sticks and fence
pickets and under the influence
of drugs or alcohol. The situation was so bad
that a proprietor had to obtain the assistance of the police to settle matters
The police had to be called again in the early hours of the following
morning. The same proprietor has reported
"Sunday 6 June I got home at 5pm to be greeted with screaming girls, foul
language and with continuous noise for most of the
30 These complaints are supported by neighbours who are not owners or occupiers
of lots in the scheme. One of them has
"Since the purchase of Unit 2 earlier in the year, it has been nothing but
noise, gatherings, screaming, filthy language, not occasionally
but all the
31 That neighbour also referred to the 4 June events.
Responses to application
32 The proprietor of one of the lots has determined, in a submission dated
12August 2004, that the problem complained of is
“still ongoing”
33 One lot proprietor believes that the problems may have eased a little, but
she is concerned that they will re-occur once the
weather warms up.
34 Another lot proprietor considers that the
“has not displayed the basic minimum standard of consideration that anyone
can reasonably be expected to display towards their
neighbours”
35 Another submission contains similar views.
36 There has been no response from the Respondent.
Considerations
37 I am satisfied that the complaint is well founded and that a Final Order
should be made.
38 Section 81(2a) allows me to express an order in terms other than sought by
an Applicant, so long as it does not differ in substance
from the Order
Final Order
39 My Final Order is that
“The proprietor of Lot 2 on Strata Plan 37016 must immediately:
(a) cease creating or permitting any noise arising
within the said Lot 2, whether within the residential portion or the external
thereof, and whether created vocally by any person or by any electronic
device, recording device, radio, television set or musical
instrument, to be
audible beyond the boundaries of the said Lot 2 on any day between the hours of
9.00pm and midnight or between
midnight and 9.00am; and
(b) cease using or permitting from the said lot 2 the use of obscene or
offensive language that is able to be heard from outside
the said Lot 2, at
and, pursuant to s.81(10) I DIRECT that this Order shall not cease to be of
any force or effect at the expiration of th period of
2 years that next succeeds
the making of this Order.
