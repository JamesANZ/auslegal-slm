O'Neill, Nick; Peisah, Carmelle --- "Preface" [2011] SydUPLawBk 2; in O'Neill, Nick; Peisah, Carmelle (eds), "Capacity and the Law" (Sydney University Press, 2011)
With the ageing of society and the associated onslaught of neurodegenerative
diseases such as dementia, and the increasing awareness
of the needs and human
rights of those with intellectual disability, head injury and mental illness,
there has been an emerging recognition
of the importance of decision-making
capacity. The need for capacity to be understood and for the parliaments and the
judges to respond
appropriately and justly to the needs of those who have lost
capacity became apparent last century. In Australia, the parliaments
created new
institutions including guardianship tribunals, offices of public guardians. They
also broadened the role of public trustees.
The judges began to develop the
common law to respond to the newly developing circumstances. Those institutions,
the statute law
and the common law (judge-made law) continue to develop in the
century. This is the first book to deal comprehensively with the
issue of capacity and the common law and statute law in Australia
over a wide
range of the situations in which questions of capacity arise.
We start the book with a chapter describing “capacity”, the legal
tests for determining it or the lack of it and the medical
conditions that can
compromise capacity. We follow with chapters dealing with the impact of
incapacity on an individual’s ability
to enter and leave relationships, to
enter contracts and to give gifts during lifetime. Those chapters are followed
by a chapter
dealing with capacity and will-making. That chapter surveys both
the established and the developing common law in this area and notes
changing expectations on lawyers who advise clients and draft wills. The law
developed to protect those taken advantage of because
of their incapacity as
well as how that incapacity is assessed by those qualified to assess it is
discussed in these three chapters.
The next part of the book deals with tribunal appointed guardians for
personal decision-making and administrators (financial managers)
to manage the
property and financial affairs of those who lack the capacity to manage their
own affairs and need a substitute appointed
to manage their finances for them.
The first chapter in this part traces the evolution of this area of the law from
a court based
system developed by the judges and essentially available only to
the rich to a tribunal based system, enacted by the parliament of
each State and
Territory, and accessible to all who need substitute decision-makers appointed
for them. The next three chapters describe
what guardianship and administration
is and what guardians and administrators (financial managers) can do. As they
deal with the
current law in relation to guardianship and administration in all
States and Territories, they are aimed at helping readers to decide
not seeking to get a substitute decision-maker appointed would be useful in a
particular case and if so the processes
for doing so in the relevant State or
Territory. These chapters also deal comprehensively with the assessment evidence
required to
demonstrate loss of capacity and the need for the appointment of a
guardian or administrator.
This part of the law is still developing with significant changes in the law
continuing to occur. For example, the legislative changes
that occurred in NSW
in mid 2009.
The two chapters in Part 3 of the book deal with the new legislation designed
to allow people appoint who they wish to act as their
substitute decision-makers
in the event of them losing their capacity to make their own decisions. These
chapters deal with enduring
guardianship and enduring powers of attorney
respectively. They too cover the legislation in all those States and
Territories that
have enduring guardianship legislation, and with enduring
powers of attorney that exist in each Australian jurisdiction. The introduction
of the mechanisms to allow people to appoint those they want as their substitute
decision-makers for personal decisions as well as
for managing their financial
affairs was important development in the late 20
The final part of the book deals with substitute consent to medical
treatment, advance directives, decision-making about treatment
and care at the
end of life, the sterilisation of incapable people and capacity to consent to
research. The six chapters of Part
4 of the book set out the relevant
legislation and common law. They also deal with assessing capacity and with the
legal and ethical
issues facing doctors and other health professionals dealing
with the matters covered by this part of the book.
The book is intended for the general reader wishing to be informed about the
issues it discusses. This explains why the book avoids
technical terms where
possible. For example “testator” is replaced by
“will-maker” and “proposed represented
“the person the hearing is about”. There are other similar changes
throughout the book.
We believe that this book, in any event but particularly because it is
accessible on the internet free of charge, will be of great
assistance to
doctors, lawyers, psychologists, social workers, nurses and other health
professionals whose work involves them dealing
with people whose
decisions-making capacity is in doubt and who need decisions made for them or
whose transactions or other actions
may not have been carried out in their
In particular the book provides clear assistance to health professionals who
are asked to provide assessments, write reports or act
as expert witnesses in
cases in which the capacity of one of those involved is questioned.
We shared the writing of this book. However, as Chapter 1 is about capacity,
Carmelle Peisah was the lead author in relation to it.
She also played the
initiating role in relation to Chapters 2, 3, and 4 and wrote most of Chapter 16
on capacity to consent to research.
Nick O’Neill was the initiator and lead writer of the other chapters.
However, those parts of any of those chapters dealing
with capacity from a
non-legal perspective or about writing reports about capacity assessments and
related matters, for example Chapter
6.12, were written either wholly or in
substantial part by Carmelle Peisah.
This substantial book would not have been completed and brought to
publication if we had not enjoyed working together and learning
from one another
as well as supporting one another to see the project through to this point.
We would like to thank the following for their assistance in answering
questions about or comments on parts of the book or in generously
other assistance. Nick O’Neill wishes to thank in particular Imelda Dodds,
John Billings, Ron Joachim, Anita Smith
and Esther Cho. He thanks Annette
O’Neill for her encouragement and support over the nearly six years it has
taken to progress
this project to the point of initial publication. He also
wishes to apologise to anyone he should have remembered to thank. Carmelle
Peisah would like to thank Anne Mellor and Ken Shulman for their suggestions
regarding Chapters 4, 13 and 14. She also thanks her
husband and children for
putting up with her obsession with the computer.
Nick O’Neill could not have undertaken this project without his
appointment as a professorial visiting fellow in the Faculty
of Law at the
University of New South Wales. At the Faculty he was provided with the physical
means of undertaking his research but
also he was made welcome by and assisted
in a myriad of ways by members of the research, teaching and administrative
staff of the
