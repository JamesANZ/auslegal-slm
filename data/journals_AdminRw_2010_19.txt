The Legislative Instruments Act
The Legislative Instruments Act
In March 2008 the Attorney-General appointed a committee to review the
Legislative Instruments Act 2003
. The Act came into force on 1 January
2005, establishing a comprehensive regime for the making, registration,
publication, parliamentary
scrutiny and sunsetting of Commonwealth legislative
instruments. The committee comprised Mr Anthony Blunn, Commonwealth
Prof. John McMillan AO and Mr Ian Govey, Deputy Secretary of the
Commonwealth Attorney-General’s Department.
Overall, the committee found that the Act is performing well by providing
public access to accurate and authoritative information
committee’s report makes 46 recommendations dealing, among other things,
with the following:
• fine-tuning the practical operation of the Act’s regime
• supporting the operation of the Federal Register of Legislative
Instruments
• encouraging better consultation practices
• promoting high drafting standards
• ensuring that legislative instruments are regularly reviewed in order to
determine whether they are still needed.
The Attorney-General
tabled the report in parliament on 14 May 2009. The Government is considering
its response.
