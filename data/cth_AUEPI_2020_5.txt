13 Meaning of
low sales volume
Note 1: For the purposes of this determination:
• models of ice cream freezer cabinets and scooping cabinets cannot be
“low sales volume”; and
• models of ice cream freezer cabinets, scooping cabinets and RSCs
cannot be “oversize”.
Note 2: A model of an RDC could be “low sales volume”,
“oversize”, both, or neither. A model of an RSC might
or might not
be “low sales volume”.
Note 3: Under this determination, the annual energy consumption (
and reference annual energy consumption (
), and hence the energy
efficiency index (
), of “low sales volume” and/or
“oversize” RDCs, and of “low sales volume” RSCs, are
differently from other RDCs and RSCs (see
sections 24
There is also an additional testing requirement for some “low sales
volume” RDCs and RSCs (see
section 27).
Note 4: For “low sales volume” RDCs and RSCs, the GEMS Regulator
may request evidence of annual sales volumes under
Note 5: A model of an RDC or an RSC may be registered on the basis that it is
“low sales volume”. For such a model, annual
sales must not exceed
the threshold sales volumes specified in this section in order for the model to
continue to be classified as
“low sales volume”.
For an RDC, if at some time after registration, its annual sales exceed the
threshold sales volumes, unless models of the product
“oversize”, they will need to comply with the requirements of this
determination that apply to RDCs generally.
For an RSC, if at some time after registration, its annual sales exceed the
threshold sales volumes, models of the product will need
to comply with the
requirements of this determination that apply to RSCs generally.
If the models do not satisfy these general requirements, the GEMS Regulator
might consider suspending or cancelling the model’s
registration under
Division 6 of
of the Act, or might consider commencing
enforcement action.
In this determination:
low sales volume
: an RDC or an RSC is
at a particular date:
(a) for an RDC or an RSC of a model that belongs to a family of
(i) the family of models is registered as a low sales volume family of
models; and
(ii) no more than 25 units of the models that belong to the family of models

(b) for an RDC or an RSC of a model that that does not belong to a family of
(i) the model is registered as a low sales volume model; and
(ii) no more than 10 units of the model are sold in the calendar year that
includes that date.
: an RDC is
if, at the time
(a) if the model of the product was registered as a result of an application
of the Act—that application; or
(b) if the model of the product was registered as a result of a subsequent
application under
of the Act—that application;
as a result of its size, there is no testing laboratory:
(c) in which the RDC is able to be tested in accordance with
ISO 23953-2; and
(d) that has been approved by the National Association of Testing
Authorities, Australia.
of Schedule 3 to this determination:
• sets out variations to ISO 23953-2 that apply for the purposes
of this determination; and
• provides for how ISO 23953-2 applies in relation to low sales
volume RSCs.

(b) meet the requirements of:
(i) the same M-package temperature class as the parent model; or
(ii) a warmer M-package temperature class than the parent model.
Additional requirements if parent model is an RDC
(4) If the parent model is an RDC, each model in the family must have:

(8) A family must not contain more than 25 models.
Specific energy consumption
(9) For subparagraph (2)(a)(i), the

as calculated in accordance with clause 5.3.6.3.5 of
ISO 23953-2; and
(b) for an RSC—the amount
in kWh per 24 hours per
as calculated in accordance with subsection (10); and

in kWh per 24 hours
as calculated in accordance with clause 6.3.7.3.5 of
EN 16838; and
(d) for an ice cream freezer cabinet—the amount
24 hours per m
as calculated in accordance with
clause 6.3.6.6.4 of EN 16901.
Note 1: For paragraph (a),
of Schedule 3 to this
determination sets out variations to ISO 23953-2 that apply for the
purposes of this determination.
Note 2: For paragraph (d),
of Schedule 3 to this
determination sets out variations to EN 16901 that apply for the purposes
of this determination. Unlike RSCs,
under EN 16901, the amount
for an ice cream freezer cabinet is calculated by dividing the energy
consumption by the “equivalent volume” (rather than
the net volume).
The “equivalent volume” of an ice cream freezer cabinet is related
to the cabinet’s net volume,
but is normalised by factors that depend on
the M-package temperature class and test room climate class.
(10) For paragraph (9)(b), for an RSC, the amount
by the following formula:
energy consumption
is the cabinet’s energy consumption in
kWh per 24 hours (see
section 12).
is the cabinet’s net volume in cubic metres
section 5).

accordance with the following formula:
is the refrigerated cabinet’s annual energy
consumption, in kWh per year, and is calculated in accordance with
section 25.
is the refrigerated cabinet’s reference annual
energy consumption, in kWh per year, and is calculated in accordance with
section 25.
Note: For refrigerated cabinets that are covered by this determination, other
than low sales volume and/or oversize RDCs and low sales
volume RSCs, the
reference annual energy consumption is equal to the standard annual energy
consumption, which represents the energy
consumption of a standard cabinet of
the relevant type.
For low sales volume and/or oversize RDCs and low sales volume RSCs, the
reference annual energy consumption is equal to the base
