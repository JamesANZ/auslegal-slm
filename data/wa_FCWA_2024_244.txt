husband seeks an order that the
("Reasons") and
the orders following the trial be suppressed pursuant to
Court Rules 2021
(WA) ("the Rules"). In support of his application, he relies
upon his affidavit, sworn 16 September 2024. The application is opposed
wife, who says in effect, the criteria upon which a suppression order could be
made have not been satisfied.
What is the husband's case?
turning to the husband's case, in support of his application, he deposes that he
is a [specialised professional] at [workplace
redacted], and during the
course of these proceedings, a number of [professional individuals] have
approached him and made inquiries
submits other professional individuals are aware of the proceedings because of
its inclusion in the daily court list and have
commented that they were
interested in reading the Reasons. The husband deposes if the Reasons are
published, he considers he will
be easily identifiable even if they are
anonymised because of: (1) the factual circumstances; (2) the matters in issue;
(3) his identity
together with the identity of his and the wife's counsel; and
(4) the trial dates.
husband deposes there is no public interest in the identification of him, nor
could there be any general interest in the Reasons,
which are specific to the
factual circumstances of his marriage. The husband deposes to being concerned
that if the Reasons are
published, they may adversely impact upon his
professional reputation, cause him both personal and professional embarrassment,
potentially impact upon his capacity to attract work. He deposes there are
no matters of new legal principle which would warrant
the reasons being
published for the benefit more broadly of family law practitioners.
response to my queries, the husband confirmed he is relying upon
section 102PF
(1)(a) and (1)(c) of the
Family Law Act 1975
What is the wife's case?
counsel on behalf of the wife observed that the Court routinely publishes
anonymised reasons, which redact information that
would identify the parties,
with redactions including not only names, but professions, the names of
witnesses or any other material
which may identify or enable the identification
of parties.
wife's senior counsel says the husband has failed to identify: (1) what
precisely would cause a prejudice to the proper administration
of justice; and
(2) any safety issues, which would otherwise support the suppression order.
counsel for the wife submits in the five years that this litigation has been on
foot, the husband's evidence at its highest
has been that he has been approached
by professional individuals who have made inquiries about his case. The
husband is silent as
to whether any of those professional individuals, for
example, have been involved in the case.
wife's senior counsel says that even if the husband were identifiable by those
that he knows, he has not articulated of what
the prejudice would be. Further,
[redacted] ought be familiar with the relevant provisions in relation to the
confidentiality of
proceedings. Senior counsel indicated in his view, there is
a broader interest in the Reasons being published, in circumstances
involved a determination of
section 106B
What is the law?
identified during the hearing,
contains provisions for
dealing with suppression and non-publication orders.
Section 102PD
safeguarding public interest in open justice, in deciding whether to make a
suppression order or non‑publication order,
the Court concerned must take
into account that a primary objective of the administration of justice is to
safeguard the public interest
in open justice.
Court, as observed, has the power to make orders on grounds permitted by this
Part to prohibit or restrict the publication or
disclosure of information, which
would tend to reveal the identity of a party or a witness, with the Court being
entitled to make
such orders as it thinks appropriate.
, sets out the grounds upon which the Court may make such an
(1) The court may make a suppression order or non - publication order on one or
more of the following grounds:
(a) the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of
(b) the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the interests of the
Commonwealth or a State or Territory in relation to national
or international
(c) the order is necessary to protect the safety of any person;
(d) the order is necessary to avoid causing undue distress or embarrassment to a
party to or witness in criminal proceedings involving
an offence of a sexual
nature (including an act of indecency).
a suppression order is made, the Court must specify the ground or grounds upon
which it has been
Norton & Landle
(Suppression or Non-Publication

, helpfully reviewed the relevant legal principles,
and from paragraph [15], stated as follows:
From those provisions,
the following points may be distilled:
Safeguarding the
public interest in open justice is a primary objective required to be taken into
account in considering making any
order under the Part;
The grounds upon
which a Court may make an order are restricted only to those within the four
sub‑paragraphs of
, and in all cases the order must be
"necessary" to achieve the particular purpose;
The suppression
or non-publication order itself must specify the ground or grounds upon which it
[16] It can therefore be seen that the drafting of
is deliberately
intended to create a regime whereby any suppression or non-publication orders,
in both ambit and duration, impact
upon open justice only to the minimum
amount necessary.
[17] There is a developing body of authority dealing with either these
provisions or their like equivalents under other legislation
based on the model
law. From those cases, the following points may be distilled:
Any suppression
order powers conferred by statute should be construed so as to minimise their
intrusion on the open justice principle:
Hogan v Hinch
(2011) 243 CLR
at [27] per French CJ and the explicit reference to that case in the
Explanatory Memorandum to the 2011 Bill at [25];
The provisions
extend not only to evidence, submissions or other material before the court at
the hearing, but also to the judgment
resulting from the trial or the hearing:
Matthews v R
[2013] NSWCCA 194
are recognised exceptions to the principle of open justice, including where
publicity would destroy the subject matter of the
proceedings or substantially
depreciate its value:
Hogan v Australian Crime Commission
[2010] HCA 21
(2010) 240 CLR
Wright Prospecting Pty Ltd v Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd
[2013] NSWSC 1069
"Necessary" has
a high threshold and means something more than convenient, reasonable or
sensible: see
Hogan v Australian Crime Commission (supra)
at 664,667 and
Rinehart v Welker
(2011) NSWCA 403
. It is not a balancing
Hogan v Australian Crime Commission (supra)
664 at [31];
"necessary" is not to be given a restricted meaning. It has to be interpreted
and applied in context, including adverting
to potentially irrational and
illogical responses to information by members of the community:
[2013] NSWCCA 156
Personal safety
of a witness or associated party may be sufficient to suppress parts of a
judgment, including those parts of the judgment
dealing with the application for
a suppression order: see
The event that
there is even some doubt that a party's or witnesses' safety may be compromised,
the party for whose protection the
suppression order is to be made is to be
given the benefit of that doubt:
Matthews v R
Fairfax Digital Australia & New Zealand v Ibrahim
[2012] NSWCCA 125
(2012) 263 FLR
The fact that
the contemplated outcome may never occur is not fatal to a finding that an order
is necessary: see
Bissett v Deputy State Coroner
[2011] NSWSC 1182
(2011) 83 NSWLR 144
Distress or
embarrassment, even to minors, likely to arise from publication or publicity is
not a sufficient reason to make a non-publication
[2012] VSC 153
(2012) 35 VR 216.
[18] The final matter to which I should advert is the well-recognised practice
of the Family Court of Australia in making its judgments
readily available on
the internet, albeit in an anonymised form. The policy reasons behind that do
not need to be discussed in these
reasons, however, plainly there is a public
interest in the work of the Court being readily available for scrutiny by
members of the public, including the media, albeit in a way which
does not offend
section 121
Family Law Act
. So long as
section 121
not breached, it is difficult to identify any reason why the work of the Court
should not be so open to public scrutiny, or any
benefit to either the public,
the Court or litigants, in its processes and outcomes not being so available.
Moreover, it is plain
that in the appropriate circumstances, a judge may take
administrative steps to anonymise reasons further than might otherwise
occur, or in the case of already published reasons, which has already
occurred: see
Patel & O'Riley
(Non-publication) (supra)
[14] per O'Ryan J. Logically, that administrative recourse may inform the answer
to the question of whether suppression or non-publication
is "necessary" to
achieve either of the four problems specified in
section 102PF(1).
Discussion and conclusion
turning to the current application, in considering whether to make a suppression
order, I must take into account that a primary
objective of the administration
of justice, is to safeguard the public interest in open justice. The
question is not whether it
is reasonable or convenient to make a suppression
order. Instead, I must be satisfied that it is necessary. It is not a

precludes the making of an
open-ended order, insofar as a suppression order.
carefully considered the husband's application, I am not satisfied that the
criteria has been satisfied. Nothing in either
the evidence or the submissions
properly satisfies me that a suppression order is necessary for his safety. To
the extent the husband
says that the order may benefit his wellbeing and
professional reputation, that is not the same as an order which is necessary for
the protection of one's safety. As observed, distress or embarrassment likely
to arise from publication, is not a sufficient reason
to make a suppression
nothing in the husband's submissions nor in his evidence satisfy me that a
suppression order is necessary to prevent prejudice
to the proper administration
of justice. From the husband's evidence, it is clear there is information
already in the public domain
insofar as the fact that the matter has appeared in
court lists. For these reasons, I decline the husband's application.
my view, the circumstances support the Court taking steps to publish anonymised
Reasons in such a manner that seeks to minimise
any potential embarrassment,
which may be experienced by the husband. I am so satisfied because in the
Reasons, a relevant consideration
was the husband's income and the
income-earning capacity. Any potential adverse impact upon the husband's income
and income earning
capacity, would be prejudicial to the husband, but also to
a consequence, I intend to make arrangements for the administrative
anonymisation of the Reasons in such a manner that would extend
normal terms.
