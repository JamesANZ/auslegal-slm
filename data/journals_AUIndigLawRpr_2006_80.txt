Biological Resources Bill 2006 (NT)
Introduction
The purpose of this Bill is to establish a regulatory framework for
bio-prospecting in the Northern Territory. Bio-prospecting is
the identification
of new substances that can be used in the manufacture of new chemical and
pharmaceutical ventures, and especially
in the making of drugs. The proposed
framework ensures that the permission of resource providers in Indigenous
communities will be
sought prior to the use of their biological resources, and
that they will have the opportunity to partake in any benefits arising
venture through a negotiated ‘Benefit Sharing Agreement’.
3 Object of Act
(1) The object of this Act is to facilitate bioprospecting in the
(2) The object is to be achieved by the following:
(a) promoting the conservation of biological resources in the Territory and the
ecologically sustainable use of those biological
(b) establishing an access regime designed to give certainty and minimise
administrative cost for persons seeking to engage in bioprospecting
(c) establishing a contractual framework for benefit-sharing agreements to be
entered into between bioprospectors and resource access
providers for the use of
Territory biological resources to ensure the equitable sharing of benefits
arising from the use of those
biological resources for biodiscovery;
(d) recognising the special knowledge held by indigenous persons about those
biological resources;
(e) seeking to ensure that social, economic and environmental benefits arising
from the use of Territory biological resources for
biodiscovery accrue to the
(f) contributing to a nationally consistent approach to bioprospecting in

aboriginal tradition for hunting, food gathering (other than for sale) and for
ceremonial and religious
