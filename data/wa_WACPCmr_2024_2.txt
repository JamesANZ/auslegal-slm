The landlord’s reason for refusing was:
• The premises
are unsuitable for keeping a pet.
The landlord and
tenants were invited to provide evidence to support their views about the

The landlord provided the following evidence:

Reasons for Decision
As a delegate of
the Commissioner, I have reviewed all evidence. Only the evidence relevant to
deciding this application is mentioned
in these reasons for decision.
Are the premises unsuitable for the requested pet?
premises is a 1-bedroom apartment located on the eighth floor of an apartment
complex. There is a 10 square metre balcony with
a metal balustrade.
landlord submits that this apartment is unsuitable for the requested pet because
of the apartment’s small size and location
on the eighth floor. The
landlord also submits that it is not fair for a dog to be kept in the small
premises unless the tenants
are going to be home all day to take the requested
pet out to relieve itself.
The tenants have developed a plan to ensure
they can appropriately meet the needs of the requested pet. This plan
• professional dog training programs, including crate
training; and
• regular activities outside the apartment including
doggy daycare and regular walks.
The tenants advise they have chosen the
King Charles Cavalier breed due to its small size and suitability for apartment
The landlord also raised concerns that the balcony balustrade
has openings that the requested pet may fall through.
Photographs
provided by the landlord show the balustrade is constructed from perforated
metal panels with openings under and between
the panels.
Request Form, the tenants state they intend to keep the requested pet off the
I have therefore decided to impose a condition that the
requested pet must be kept off the balcony at all times until it cannot fit
through the balustrade openings. This is an effective and practical solution
that will alleviate the landlord’s concerns, and
ensure the requested pet
Risk of nuisance
The landlord raised concerns about
potential nuisance (such as barking) caused by the requested pet.
RTA stipulates that tenants are responsible for all nuisance caused by a pet
kept at the premises. I am satisfied that the landlord
has appropriate remedies
under the RTA to address any potential nuisance caused by the requested pet.
There are also requirements under the
Dog Act 1976
(WA) which deal with
nuisance dogs that the tenants would have to comply with if there were
complaints.
Considering the information from the landlord
and the tenants, and on the condition that the requested pet is kept off the
until it cannot fit through the balustrade openings, I am not satisfied
that the premises are unsuitable for keeping the requested

decision can appeal to the Magistrates Court of Western Australia. Appeals must
