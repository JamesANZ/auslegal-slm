‘Ice Rushes’, Data Shadows and Methylamphetamine Use in Rural
Towns: Wastewater Analysis
Jeremy Prichard,
Phong Thai,
Australia’s world-class drug monitoring systems have difficulty
gathering metrics in rural communities for reasons due to, among
other things,
the size of the country and problems with recruiting sufficient sample sizes.
Some rural communities in data shadows
(where few metrics on substance use
exist) may benefit from wastewater analysis (‘WWA’) as a means of
estimating per
capita drug consumption. Wastewater analysis could be employed
when debates rise about the consumption of particular drugs in certain
communities. Other ways to use WWA are examined, including long-term monitoring
of community drug consumption and intervention studies
to test the effectiveness
of health or law enforcement drug strategies. To explore the utility of WWA,
this article references media
coverage of methylamphetamine consumption in a
small Tasmanian town, Smithton, and presents the results of the first Tasmanian
pilot study of methylamphetamine consumption, conducted in 2014–15.

Introduction
Australia’s criminal justice system, like those in many other
countries, expends significant resources responding to illicit
drug markets.
Police services and intelligence agencies are tasked with the monumental role of
enforcing national drug laws. Of all
defendants finalised in Australian courts
in 2015–16, an estimated 11 per cent (63,541 defendants) had illicit drug
as their principal offence (ABS 2017a). Not surprisingly, drug offences
place substantial demands upon corrective services as well;
approximately 14 per
cent of all inmates across the country were principally in custody for illicit
drug offences as at 30 June 2016
(ABS 2017b).
Monitoring the illicit drug market enables the criminal justice system to,
among other things: assess the effectiveness of law enforcement
strategies and
policies (Willis, Anderson & Homel 2011); gather intelligence on emerging
trends (Stafford & Breen 2016; Sindicich
& Burns 2014); and better
understand the nexus between substance use and crime (Sweeney & Payne 2012).
Monitoring systems
are also crucial for health portfolios in understanding
relationships between substance use and population-level disease, providing
early detection of new health risks, determining priorities for harm reduction
strategies and so forth (Hall & Degenhardt 2009).
However, criminological
and epidemiological objectives should not be thought of as disparate.
Epidemiology provides essential empirical
evidence on many of the harms that
criminal drug laws are designed to address: physical and mental harms to the
health of both the
individual consumer and the broader community (see, for
example, AIHW 2014).
Cannabis, MDMA (‘ecstasy’), cocaine, heroin and methylamphetamine
are major drugs of concern in Australia. This article
solely focuses on
methylamphetamine. This substance has notoriety in the public mind, particularly
in the form of crystalline methylamphetamine,
or ‘ice’. The
potential deleterious effects of heavy methylamphetamine use are not
contentious. It is linked with psychoses
(McKetin et al. 2010; Darke et al.
2008) and health problems such as heart attacks and strokes (Kaye et al. 2007;
Degenhardt, Roxburgh
& McKetin 2007). Ice use is also associated with
violent behaviour and criminal activity, though the nature of these
relationships
is debated (McKetin et al. 2016).
Like other illicit drugs, methylamphetamine use in the population is
difficult to measure because it attracts community stigma and
relatively clandestine (Groves 2014; Degenhardt & Hall 2012). In recent
years serious concerns have been raised about
the harms caused by
methylamphetamine use in regional and rural areas of the country. Those who work
in criminological and epidemiological
portfolios have become accustomed to
sensationalist coverage of drug use by mainstream media outlets. However,
analysis of rural
methylamphetamine use has also been undertaken by
‘highbrow’ media outlets (Smith and Phillips 2006, p. 826), notably
the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s (‘ABC’s’)
(‘“Ice” Destroying Rural Youth’)
Four Corners
(‘Ice Rush’), which were both aired in
October 2014 (ABC 2014a,
programs examined a number of rural towns, including Smithton in
Tasmania’s north-west. After interviewing key stakeholders
with divergent
views on methylamphetamine use in Smithton, the ABC programs concluded that the
extent of the problem could not be
determined.
At one end of the spectrum, it was suggested that there was no evidence that
methylamphetamine use had increased in Smithton and that
consumption there was
no worse than in other parts of the country. At the other end it was suggested
that one in ten Smithton residents
were ‘addicted’ to ice (ABC
2014c). One reason that neither the stakeholders nor the ABC could definitively
whether there was a ‘problem, a crisis or an epidemic’ (ABC
2014c) is that Smithton lies in a data shadow. It is not
included in any of the
ongoing national drug monitoring systems that study: the general population
(National Drug Strategy Household
Survey); people who inject illicit substances
(Illicit Drug Reporting Systems); people who use party drugs (Ecstasy and
Related Drug
Reporting System); and people who have been arrested (Drug Use
Monitoring Australia).
This article has three main sections. The first explores research on drug
consumption in regional and rural parts of Australia, with
special reference to
methylamphetamine. It explains what wastewater analysis (‘WWA’) is,
examines recent findings of
the first national WWA pilot study in Australia (Lai
et al. 2016a), and discusses the usefulness of WWA in monitoring drug
consumption
in the general population. The article then presents findings from a
pilot study in Tasmania involving 22 WWA samples from catchments
servicing over
66 per cent of the Tasmanian population (>301,365 people), including samples
from Smithton in
2014–15. With the Tasmanian data as a reference point, the article
finally discusses the utility of WWA in (a) gathering better
data on rural drug
consumption, and (b) testing strategies to reduce drug-consumption in rural
communities.
Methylamphetamine in rural areas
Quantifying the extent of substance use in rural and remote areas is
challenging. Australia’s geographical size and population
spread makes
studying substance use outside of urban and suburban population centres
expensive and slow; in some contexts researchers
may need to overcome additional
challenges relating to ‘talking to outsiders about drug issues’
(Delahunty & Putt
2006, p. 3). Consequently, comparatively little is known
populations has been recognised for some time (Gately, Ellis & Morris 2016;
Wallis et al. 2009; Delahunty & Putt 2006).
Some might argue that the lack
of criminological research on rural substance use is not only due to practical
hurdles, but to an
inherent urban-centric bias within the discipline of
criminology (Carrington, Donnermeyer & DeKeseredy 2014), at least in its
modern form (DeKeseredy 2016). This important issue is relevant to this article
but beyond its scope.
What is known about methylamphetamine consumption in rural places in
Australia? The
National Ice Taskforce Final Report
(Commonwealth of
Australia 2015) was based on a variety of information sources, including
interviews with a series of experts across
the country and over 1300 public
submissions. The report indicated that methylamphetamine is being trafficked to
both urban and rural
areas of Australia, with some remote communities targeted
using aggressive strategies to stimulate demand, such as providing periods
cheap supply.
A range of other sources indicate that use of methylamphetamine is not solely
an urban phenomenon. For example, police records of
incidents involving the
possession or use of
methylamphetamine
have been mapped across 28 New South Wales (‘NSW’) local government
areas (‘LGAs’) (BOCSAR 2016). Setting
aside urban areas for a
moment, these data indicate marked rises in the annual number of possess/use
incidents in some regional areas.
For example, in the Riverina, the number of
incidents rose from 89 in the 2011–12 financial year to 228 in
2015–16. Similarly,
over the same time period, the numbers in Coffs
Harbour–Grafton rose from 52 to 205. Figure 1 shows the total number of
recorded in LGAs in greater Sydney and regional NSW between
2006–07 and 2015–16.
Figure 1: Amphetamine-related policing incidents (possession or use),
greater Sydney and regional NSW, 2006–07 to 2015–16
Source: Adapted from BOSCAR (2016).
The BOCSAR data show a tripling of amphetamine-related incidents in both
greater Sydney and regional NSW over the six years between
2009–10 and
2015–16. As Willis, Anderson and Homel (2011) point out, interpreting
police records such as these can be
difficult. Among other things, it can be
difficult to disentangle whether observed fluctuations reflect changes in the
drug market,
or changes in police strategies and resources. However, arguably
the scale of the trends in NSW is so substantial that it is probably
attributable in part to an increase in methylamphetamine consumption.
Some studies have examined rural methylamphetamine use using survey methods.
To understand the prevalence and nature of substance
use in Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander Communities, Delahunty and Putt (2006) interviewed police
officers in rural (
=493) and urban (
=299) areas in South
Australia, Western Australia (‘WA’), the Northern Territory
(‘NT’) and Queensland. At
the time this research was conducted the
findings indicated that amphetamine use was problematic in some rural
communities, but that
the prevalence of use was lower than in urban areas.
Conversely, the police participants’ reports suggested higher rates of
of both cannabis and inhalants in rural settings. Delahunty and Putt (2006)
appear to be the first researchers to underscore
the potentially large profits
that can be made in trafficking illicit substances into rural and remote
Recent self-report data for Australia are available through the National Drug
Strategy Household Survey (‘NDSHS), the primary
monitoring system for
substance use in the general community, which is conducted every three years. In
2013, the NDSHS interviewed
23,855 people aged 14 years and over and had a 49
per cent response rate (AIHW 2014). The 2013 survey categorised regions into
cities, inner regional, outer regional and remote/very remote (see further
AIHW 2014, p. 86). Participants reported ‘recent
use’ (that is, use
in the preceding 12 months) of any illicit substance, including non-therapeutic
use of pharmaceuticals.
The rate of recent substance use was comparable across
regions and even slightly higher outside of the larger population centres:
city 14.9 per cent, inner regional 14.1 per cent, outer regional 16.7 per cent,
and remote/very remote 18.7 per cent. The findings
on methylamphetamine were
less informative. Rates of recent methylamphetamine use were similar in major
cities (1.8 per cent), inner
regional areas (1.7 per cent) and outer regional
areas (2.1 per cent). The rate for remote/very remote places was 4.5 per cent.
because of the hurdles associated with recruiting a sufficient number
of participants in remote/very remote places, the AIHW (2014,
NDS-2013-specific-population-groups) cautioned against interpreting this figure
because it has a relative standard error
greater than 50 per cent.
Another method used to estimate the community’s consumption of illicit
drugs is WWA. This involves collecting wastewater from
wastewater treatment
plants over a 24-hour period and analysing the samples with liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry. Although
the WWA field only commenced in
2005 (Zuccatto et al. 2005), it is now an established international method and
forms part of the
ongoing drug monitoring systems in Europe (Ort et al. 2014).
Wastewater analysis monitoring across Australia has recently been implemented
with funding from the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission.
The process of collecting wastewater, analysing the samples, and estimating
population drug consumption – typically in milligrams
per day per 1000
people – has been explained elsewhere in detail (Prichard et al. 2012).
There appears to be relatively broad
agreement that WWA provides data that
usefully complement existing drug monitoring systems, many of which rely on
self-reported information
from substance users. Like any method, it has
limitations that are important to understand. Critically, WWA cannot provide
information
This means that WWA alone cannot inform policy-makers about how
individuals use different substances, the quantities they use, their preferred
routes of administration (for example,
snorting, injecting, smoking) or the
harms associated with their substance use behaviours. Wastewater analysis can
monitor changes
in population drug consumption, but alone it cannot determine
whether increases in consumption are being driven by more people using
existing users increasing their intake (van Nuijs et al. 2011) or a combination
of these factors.
A related complication is the effect of drug purity on WWA. If WWA data are
interpreted without reference to information on drug purity,
then fluctuations
in purity could be misinterpreted as indicating that more people are using the
drug (Bruno, van Dyken & Prichard
2014). Additionally, for analytical
reasons some drugs are difficult to study with WWA, notably cannabis and heroin
(Prichard et
al. 2012). Here it is important to note that current standard WWA
analyses cannot presently distinguish between consumption of ‘ice’
(crystalline methylamphetamine) and other forms of methylamphetamine.
Finally, small populations present additional challenges in estimating per
capita consumption in WWA research. This is because the
estimates of consumption
are based on the average rate at which particular chemicals are excreted from
the human body (see Prichard
et al., 2012, p. 3). The average excretion rate is
reasonably reliable for larger groups but much less reliable with smaller groups
because individuals can differ markedly in their capacity to metabolise illicit
drugs. Another challenge which cannot be overlooked
for small populations is the
difficulty of collecting representative samples from the influent streams. Small
populations are most
susceptible to large flow variations and thus high
frequency flow proportional sampling is necessary to ensure flow fluxes are
sampled. Additionally, smaller populations may have few people who
consume a particular substance and as such toilet flushes by such
consumers may
be inadequately sampled if high frequency sampling is not conducted (Castiglioni
et al. 2013).
In large populations WWA has advantages in understanding broad trends over
time that overcome the accepted limitations of self-report
methods. In
comparison to these methods, WWA is comparatively efficient and cost effective;
it also captures information on hundreds
of thousands of people over 24-hour
cycles (Prichard et al. 2012). Furthermore, whereas people who use illicit
substances may be
difficult to recruit (Degenhardt et al. 2011) or disinclined
to participate in a self-report study (Hall & Degenhardt
2009; Harrison
, WWA captures data from large portions of populations within the
boundaries of sewage treatment plant catchments. Finally, WWA can
accurately identify dozens of substances, including methylamphetamine, cocaine,
MDMA, ketamine (Thai et al. 2016), alcohol
(Mastroianni, de Alda & Barcelo
2014) and tobacco (Castiglioni et al., 2015).
Several WWA studies have estimated drug consumption in the general population
of Australia (eg Tscharke et al., 2015; Irvine et al.
2011). Lai and colleagues
(2016a) compared methylamphetamine in wastewater in two Queensland population
centres, one urban and the
other semi-rural, using a total of 1,203 wastewater
samples collected between 2009 and 2015. Over the time period examined,
consumption
of methylamphetamine increased fivefold in the urban setting and
threefold in the semi-rural area.
The same research team also recently published the results of the first
national WWA pilot study (Lai et al., 2016b) with samples
collected over about
one week in mid-2015 in the NT, Queensland, NSW, Victoria, the Australian
Capital Territory (‘ACT’)
and WA. Using population data from the
Australian Bureau of Statistics, Lai et al. (2016b) reported that the catchments
in the pilot study served approximately 40 per cent of all Australians.
The results indicated that consumption of methylamphetamine
was higher and more
consistent across all sites than consumption of cocaine or MDMA. Three of the 14
sites were classified as rural.
Consumption rates of methylamphetamine in these
sites was comparable to the majority of the urban sites. The same pattern was
observed for cocaine and MDMA, the consumption rates of which were very low
in the rural catchments.
The next section of this article presents new results from separate WWA
analyses conducted in Tasmanian sites, including in Smithton.
Tasmanian WWA methylamphetamines pilot study
The purpose of this section is to illustrate the potential utility of WWA in
studying methylamphetamine use – or certain other
substances of concern
– in a rural setting. This section presents original findings on
methylamphetamine consumption in Tasmania.
Table 1 gives an overview of some of
the key features of the pilot study in Tasmania. The first column lists the
seven sites. Following
established ethical conventions (Prichard et al. 2016)
the locations of the sites are anonymised and only broad population indicators
are provided to protect anonymity.

* Very low populations; data to be treated with low confidence.
** Mean of raw data from 22 samples, not grand mean of sites.
Twenty-eight 24-hour composite samples were collected between 2013 and 2015
at sewage treatment plants with the assistance of water
authorities. The
collected samples were analysed for methylamphetamine by liquid chromatography
coupled to tandem mass spectrometry
as previously described by Lai et al.
(2016a). The small number of samples collected at each site was the main
limitation of the
pilot study and, for this reason, comparisons between sites
should be made with caution. In addition, Tas B and F have estimated
populations
of fewer than 300 people and consequently the findings from these sites are not
considered reliable. Nonetheless, they
are included here because they are useful
to the discussion below.
The final column in Table 1 shows the estimated milligrams of
methylamphetamine consumed per day per 1000 people. Leaving aside Tas
the table indicates that mean consumption was similar in Tas A, D, E and G;
these sites ranged between 95 mg to 146 mg over
the period of sampling. The
estimated mean consumption from the two Tas C samples was higher (252 mg). The
name of this location
cannot be revealed, but it is important to state it was
not Smithton. The average across the Tasmanian sites, excluding Tas B and
142 mg. This is arguably the most robust figure presented in the table
because it is based on 22 samples from wastewater treatment
plants that
collectively serve about 300,000 people.
The results presented in Table 1 do little to resolve the Smithton
methylamphetamine question. The discussion here is necessarily
limited because
the locations included in the study cannot be revealed. But even if the data
applicable to Smithton could be provided,
the findings would be indeterminate
because of the study’s inherent limitations. Although sampling occurred
over 2013–15
when Smithton’s methylamphetamine consumption was in
the limelight, only a handful of samples were collected from the community.
Clearly, in between the days on which samples were collected, Smithton’s
methylamphetamine consumption could have fluctuated
(upwards or downwards). In
addition, for the reasons outlined above about WWA’s incapacity to provide
information about individuals,
the Smithton samples cannot shed light on the
extent of methylamphetamine
within the town. In other words,
WWA could never address the claims about the extent of ice
‘addiction’ in Smithton.
However, when the data are considered as a whole, they do have bearing on the
debate about Smithton in 2014. Figure 2 presents the
estimated mean consumption
of methylamphetamine in Tasmania per 1000 people (142 mg) and compares this with
the 14 Australian sites
included in Lai et al.’s (2016b) pilot study,
which was conducted in 2015.
Methamphetamine
Figure 2: Mean methylamphetamine consumption (mg/day/1000 people) by
* Regional area. Figures for all sites except Tasmania adapted from Lai et
al. (2016b).
The WWA data presented in Figure 2 indicate that in the periods of sampling
Tasmania’s estimated methylamphetamine consumption
rates were much smaller
than those from other jurisdictions. Estimated consumption in Tasmania was half
that of the ACT and about
one-eighth that of sites in Victoria (Vic B), WA (WA
A) and Queensland (QLD A).
How do these results compare with the NDSHS? The NDSHS data – dating
that Tasmania is
very similar to other jurisdictions in terms of participants’ reported use
of any drug in the preceding 12
months (AIHW 2014, Table 7.9
NDS-2013-state-and-territory-comparisons). However, comparisons cannot
confidently be made with regards
to methylamphetamine because the NDSHS data for
Tasmania had relative standard error of 25 per cent to 50 per cent (AIHW 2014,
7.12 NDS-2013-state-and-territory-comparisons). The same statistical
problem affected data on use of most illicit drugs in the Tasmanian
survey, with the exception of cannabis, because of a combination of the small
sample size in regional areas and the low prevalence
of illicit drug use in
these areas.
During 2013–15, could the Tasmanian methylamphetamine market have been
smaller than in other jurisdictions proportionate to
population size?
Researchers have not addressed this specific issue to date. However, two factors
that may limit the market are Tasmania’s
demography and the fact that it
is an island. This means that drugs have to be manufactured locally or
trafficked to Tasmania by
air or sea. Tasmania has a small population of 519,000
people (ABS 2016). As at 2012, 58 per cent of Tasmanians lived outside of
capital city, Hobart (ABS 2013). This is the highest percentage of all
Australian jurisdictions. Consequently, Tasmania probably
does not provide an
attractive business model from an organised crime perspective. Since the
population is small and dispersed, the
pool of potential consumers of
methylamphetamine is small and geographically dispersed. These features,
combined with the island
factor, might inhibit large-scale trafficking for rapid
None of these arguments precludes the possibility that methylamphetamine
consumption might have increased since 2015 – if not
across Tasmania, at
least in particular Tasmanian communities. And in small communities, like
Smithton, heavy use by a few individuals
may have a bigger impact (for example,
through property offences and offences related to public disorder) than in large
communities.
Having said that, it is interesting to consider how the ABC might
have covered the Smithton story in 2014 had it had access to the
presented in this article. Reflecting on the question posed at the outset as to
whether methylamphetamine in Smithton was
a ‘problem, a crisis, or an
epidemic’ (ABC 2014c), we suggest that on balance the WWA data support the
thesis and arguably discount the ‘epidemic’
Implications and potential applications
The ambit of this article is larger than Smithton and Tasmania. Its purpose
is to unpack what WWA may have to offer many rural communities
in Australia
– at least those with defined sewerage systems and wastewater treatment
plants. Wastewater analysis is an additional
tool that can be used periodically
to address public health debates about the extent of drug use in rural areas.
So, for example,
if concern begins to rise about methylamphetamine consumption
in a particular town, WWA could be used to gather regular samples over
of months at the town and at other sites for comparative purposes. Such data
could assist rural communities to move beyond
uncertainty when expert opinion is
divided on the extent of a drug problem.
Wastewater analysis could also be used routinely in rural settings to monitor
the consumption of methamphetamine and other substances
over time. If water
authorities and local governments are invested in the long-term utility of WWA,
for a small cost they can regularly
collect and preserve samples from wastewater
treatment plants following accepted protocols. The samples can be analysed as
This in-kind support significantly reduces the cost of WWA research. It
would also benefit rural communities that wanted to monitor
consumption of drugs, alcohol, tobacco and so forth. Some rural communities may
find WWA empowering inasmuch as they would
be less dependent on agencies located
in capital cities to gather policy-relevant data.
As the number of samples collected from a particular site increases over
time, so does statistical power. This means that a greater
array of statistical
tests can be conducted and greater confidence can be placed in the validity of
the results. With an adequate
dataset, statisticians could attempt to measure
whether particular events or changes within a rural town had any impact on drug
consumption.
For instance, analyses could examine whether drug consumption
decreased after a sudden increase in jobs, or increased with the construction
a new highway.
Wastewater analysis could be used as a tool to prospectively evaluate
‘interventions’. The idea of using WWA in an intervention
proposed by the authors in the context of prison research (Prichard et al.
2010). Interventions to reduce drug consumption
in a rural town could take many
forms (although their common objective would be to reduce the adverse health,
social and economic
consequences of substance use). For example, an intervention
operated by law enforcement agencies would probably focus on supply
such as disrupting drug trafficking nodes critical to the local market.
Health-focused intervention strategies would focus
on demand reduction via
public education campaigns, and counselling and drug treatment and
rehabilitation programs for problem users.
Relevant agencies would cooperate with WWA researchers to determine the sites
of interest. The WWA researchers would monitor the town
before, during and after
the intervention to determine if the intervention had an impact on drug
consumption and how long the effect
lasted. Two empirical strategies could
provide a control. First, the study could employ an A-B-A-B design, so that the
baseline monitoring (A) and the intervention (B) was repeated twice.
This would provide an internal control, namely the removal of
the intervention;
any change in consumption observed after the second intervention period would
strengthen the argument for a causal
influence of the intervention. The second
option would be to monitor other rural towns as control groups; these towns
would be matched
by demographic, geographic and economic profiles.
Rural towns may be empirically ideal for WWA intervention studies,
particularly if they are an hour or more drive from other population
Semi-remote and remote rural towns help to control for population movement. To
explain further, in a city serviced by multiple
wastewater treatment plants,
drugs may be consumed in one catchment (such as a nightclub) and then excreted
in another (such as a
person’s home). This potential disconnect between
places might mask the effects of an intervention, depending on its size and
duration. In contrast, WWA intervention studies could be used with greater
confidence in rural towns because of the ‘continuity
between the intervention, the drug consumption and the drug excretion.
It is likely that as the field of rural-WWA-research continues new challenges
will be encountered. For example, it is feasible that
the usefulness of WWA
could be limited in particular rural communities where septic tanks are used by
significant portions of the
However, in our
view it is worthwhile to investigate if, how and where WWA may be a useful tool
in the rural context.
Australia is the world’s sixth-largest country geographically, but only
cities and inner regional
areas (ABS 2008). Consequently, there are significant challenges in using
traditional survey research methods
to examine drug consumption in rural parts
of the country. For rural communities connected to the public sewerage system,
good potential as a new empirical tool to estimate community drug
consumption efficiently and anonymously. Wastewater analysis is
now an accepted
and useful method for monitoring substance use in the community, as demonstrated
by Lai et al.’s (2016a) study
of 14 Australian sites, capturing 40 per
cent of the population. That study, combined with the results of the Tasmanian
pilot study
presented in this article, illustrates the capacity of WWA to
provide metrics on substance use in rural settings.
Although the Tasmanian data constitute preliminary research only, they
nonetheless underscore several useful points. Some rural communities
may come to
view WWA as a practical form of research that can inform particular debates,
like that which unfolded about Smithton
in 2014. Clearly WWA could also be used
over a longer time frame to gather trend data regarding the consumption of a
wide variety
of substances over time, including alcohol and tobacco. It is
definitely true that WWA is best used in conjunction with traditional
studying drug consumption, including self-report methods and analyses of police
data. However, given the numbers of communities
in data shadows outside of the
catchment of Australia’s ongoing drug monitoring systems, the reality is
that robust studies
of many small rural communities are unlikely to occur using
traditional research methods. The isolated and relatively closed nature
rural communities provide useful opportunities for testing the efficacy of
particular intervention options with WWA. These
designs may allow law
enforcement and health agencies to determine if strategies to reduce drug
consumption are effective and worth
resourcing.

recent examples of media coverage of methylamphetamine see
(aired 7 February 2017).
BOCSAR uses
the term ‘amphetamine’; other sources report on the use of
‘amphetamine-type substances’ (Gaffney
et al. 2010, p. 14). However,
both terms are practically equivalent to methylamphetamine due to the almost
exclusive use of the latter
in Australia (AIHW 2014).
Data on septic tanks
systems are not readily available. Statistics from 2002 indicated that 4 per
cent of NSW households (
=103,100) had a septic tank and were not connect
to the public sewerage system (ABS 2002).
