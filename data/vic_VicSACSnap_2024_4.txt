Sentencing Snapshot 288: Sentencing Trends for Intentionally Causing
Serious Injury in the Higher Courts of Victoria 2018-19 to 2022-23
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of
intentionally causing serious injury in the County and Supreme Courts of
Victoria (the higher courts) from 2018-19
Adjustments made by
the Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at June 2023 have been
incorporated into the data in this Snapshot.
Detailed data on intentionally causing serious injury and other offences is
also available on
A person who intentionally causes serious injury to another person without
lawful excuse is guilty of this offence. Intentionally
causing serious injury is
an indictable offence that carries a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment
and/or a fine of 2,400 penalty
If the offence was committed between 20 March 2017 and 27 October 2018, it is
a category 2 offence. If the offence was committed on
or after 28 October 2018,
then it is either a category 1 offence (if the victim was on duty as an
emergency worker, custodial officer
or youth justice worker) or a category 2
offence (if the victim was not). For category 1 offences, courts must almost
always impose
a custodial
For category 2
offences, courts must impose a custodial sentence except in particular
circumstances.
This Snapshot focuses on cases where intentionally causing serious injury was
the principal offence, that is, cases where intentionally
causing serious injury
was the offence that received the most severe
Intentionally causing serious injury was the principal offence in 1.3% of
cases sentenced in the higher courts between 2018-19 and
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic particularly in the 2020-21 and 2021-22
years. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced in the period after March 2020 may be lower than in other years
because the pandemic caused delays
in court proceedings
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases in that period and
therefore higher imprisonment rates than in
other years
prison sentences
may be shorter during that period than in other years to reflect the combined
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the
justice system and
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2018-19 to 2022-23, 108 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of intentionally causing serious
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
intentionally causing serious injury by financial year.
There were 26 people
sentenced for this offence in 2022-23, up from 21 in the previous year. The
number of people sentenced was highest
in 2018-19 (30 people) and lowest in
2019-20 (15 people).
There was also 1 person who received an unconditional release order and 6
people who received a non-custodial supervision order for
the principal offence
of intentionally causing serious injury during the five-year period. They are
not included in this Snapshot.

Sentence types and trends
Figure 2 shows the proportion of people who received
an immediate custodial sentence or non-custodial sentence for the principal
of intentionally causing serious injury. An immediate custodial sentence
involves at least some element of immediate imprisonment
The rate of
immediate custodial sentences was lowest in 2020-21 (93.8%) and highest in
2018-19, 2019-20 and 2021-22 (100%). Over
the five-year period, 98.1% of people
were given an immediate custodial sentence.

Over the five-year period, most people sentenced for intentionally causing
serious injury received a principal sentence of imprisonment

4 people), and a community correction
order (1.9% or 2

Principal and total effective sentences of imprisonment

from 2018-19
to 2022-23.
The principal sentence describes the sentences for the offence at
The total effective sentence is the sentence imposed for all charges in a
case and applies at a
level. Where a case involves
multiple charges, the total effective sentence will be either the same as or
longer than the principal

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an imprisonment term of
less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the discretion to fix
a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
years or more, the court must
impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.

offence of intentionally causing serious injury, 99 were eligible
