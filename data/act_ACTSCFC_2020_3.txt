Introduction
1. On 13 December 2002 the defendant was admitted to the Roll
of Legal Practitioners maintained by the Supreme Court of the Australian
2. On 22 March 2017 the defendant came to trial before a judge
and jury facing 10 counts of unlawful sexual activity in respect of
separate female complainants.
3. On 5 April 2017 the jury returned verdicts
of guilty on eight of the 10 counts. Notably these included Counts 6 and 8 which
offences of sexual intercourse without consent.
4. The defendant was
sentenced for the offences of which he had been found guilty on 14 July 2017.
The total sentence was four years
with a non-parole period of two years and six
months (R v Hoyle (No 2)
[2017] ACTSC 175).
5. The defendant appealed against
both his convictions and the sentences. The appeal was dismissed on 28 September
2018 (Hoyle v The
[2018] ACTCA 42).
6. On 26 August 2020 the plaintiff
filed an originating application seeking an order that “pursuant to the
inherent jurisdiction
and powers of the Court”, the defendant’s name
be removed from the above roll. The application is supported by an affidavit
Mr Robert Reis sworn on 18 August 2020. Mr Reis is the professional standards
manager of the ACT Law Society.
7. On 9 November 2020 the Associate to the
Chief Justice wrote, by email, to the parties asking the defendant if he
objected to Elkaim
J (the trial and sentencing judge) being a member of the
court hearing the application. The defendant, on the following day, replied
he had no objection and continued:
I have advised I am not contesting this matter, and meaning no disrespect to the
Court, and consistent with the restrictions NSW
authorities have on my parole do
not intend attending the hearing.
8. The email exchange is Exhibit 1. Consistently, the defendant
did not appear at the hearing.
9. Based on the above response it can be
confidently concluded that the defendant does not oppose the
application.
10. Notwithstanding the defendant’s position, however, it
is incumbent upon the court to satisfy itself that the defendant’s
should be removed from the roll.
11. This issue is dependent upon the answer
to this question: Is the defendant a fit and proper person to practise as a
legal practitioner.
The question must be answered as at the time of the
12. It is first of all necessary to refer to the conduct that made
up the charges against the defendant. They were summarised, together
relevant sentences, by the Court of Appeal in this way:
On 14 July 2017, the trial judge sentenced the appellant. The outcomes of the
charges were as follows:
(a) Count 1—On 20 April 2015, commit an act of indecency in the presence
of ZG without consent and being reckless as to consent
(he showed her
pornographic material on websites that he alleged that she had surfed while
doing the assignment). Guilty: two months’
imprisonment, 5 September
2020– 4 November 2020.
(b) Count 2—On 20 April 2015 (on the same occasion as Count 1), commit act
of indecency on ZG without consent and being reckless
as to consent (after she
began to cry, he suggested that she could do something to make it go away and
then placed his hands on her
thighs “in a comforting touch with some
strength”). Not guilty.
(c) Count 3—On 23 April 2015, commit an act of indecency on KA without
consent and being reckless as to consent (after raising
the allegation of
plagiarism and asking her what she could do about it, he held her on the back,
pulled her face towards his face
and—she thought—wanted to kiss
her). Guilty: two months’ imprisonment, 5 October 2020–4 December
(d) Count 4—On 23 April 2015 (at the first meeting with her), commit an
act of indecency on TL without consent and being reckless
as to consent (after
raising the allegation of plagiarism, he suggested that she could “do
something” to prevent it being
taken further, then he touched her knee and
tried to touch her breast but she pushed him away). Guilty: four months’
imprisonment,
5 October 2020–4 February 2021.
(e) Count 5—On 29 April 2015 (during his second meeting with her) commit
an act of indecency on TL without consent and being
reckless as to consent
(after asking her what she would like to suggest in relation to the plagiarism
allegation, he touched her
breast and leg, placed his hands under her skirt and
touched her underwear). Guilty: four months’ imprisonment, 5 November
2020–4 March 2021.
(f) Count 6—On 29 April 2015 (during his second meeting with her) engage
in sexual intercourse with TL without consent and
being reckless as to consent 7
(he pulled down her stockings and engaged in digital penetration). Guilty: three
years’ imprisonment,
5 April 2017–4 April 2020.
(g) Count 7—On 29 April 2015 (during his second meeting with her) commit
an act of indecency on TL without consent and being
reckless as to consent (he
lifted her up, kissed her on the lips, touched her breast and tried to put his
tongue in her mouth). Guilty:
four months’ imprisonment, 5 November
2020–4 March 2021.
(h) Count 8—On 29 April 2015 (during his second meeting with her) engage
in sexual intercourse with TL without consent and
being reckless as to consent
(he removed his clothing and underwear and engaged in penile/vaginal
intercourse). Guilty: three years
and six months’ imprisonment, 5 April
2017–4 October 2020.
(i) Count 9—On 24 April 2015 commit an act of indecency on EO without
consent and being reckless as to consent (he placed his
hands on her thighs and
briefly touched her upper arm). Not guilty.
(j) Count 10—On 28 April 2015 commit an act of indecency on UU without
consent and being reckless as to consent (after telling
her that he didn’t
want her to fail and asking her for a kiss, he touched her face, kissed her
forehead, cheeks and lips and
touched her breast). Guilty: two months’
imprisonment, 5 February 2021–4 April 2021.
13. As reflected in the respective sentences, the overall
sentence was dominated by Counts 6 and 8.
14. The background to the charges
was that the defendant was a lecturer in the Business Law course at the
University of Canberra.
The complainants were students in this course. They were
all international students attending the University on student visas. The
defendant conducted the various assaults on the premise of examining assignments
submitted by the students and suggesting to them
that they had been guilty of
plagiarism. The assaults were an attempt to obtain sexual gratification from the
students by taking
advantage of their vulnerability as holders of temporary
15. All of the students were significantly younger than the defendant
who held a position of authority over them and also a position
of influence, in
particular in his role as their lecturer and assessor of their
assignments.
16. The offences were committed in 2015 and took place against a
number of complainants over a number of days.
17. The defendant gave evidence
at his trial. He vehemently denied the allegations. It is implicit in the
verdicts that he was not
believed and lied to the jury.
defendant’s current attitude to the offences is unknown. There is however
no reason to anticipate that he now acknowledges
his wrongdoing or has any
insight into his criminal conduct. As recently as 6 April 2019 he continued to
assert his innocence (see
the letter to Mr John Wilson at page 881 of the
exhibit to Mr Reis’s affidavit).
19. A criminal conviction alone does
not necessarily affect the status of being a fit and proper person to practise
law. The New South
Wales Court of Appeal said this in Prothonotary of the
Supreme Court of New South Wales v Thomson
[2018] NSWCA 230
, from [12]:
The ultimate question for this Court is whether Mr Thomson is a fit and
proper person to remain on the roll. Its determination
requires the application
of established principles reflecting the purpose of disciplinary proceedings
against a legal practitioner,
which is the protection of the public, rather than
the punishment of that individual:
Wentworth v New South Wales Bar
Association
(1992) 176 CLR 239
at 250–251 (Deane, Dawson, Toohey
and Gaudron JJ). In
New South Wales Bar Association v
(2001) 52 NSWLR 279
[2001] NSWCA 284
Spigelman CJ identified four “interrelated interests” which may
be regarded as protected by such proceedings:
Clients must feel secure in confiding their secrets and entrusting their most
personal affairs to lawyers. Fellow practitioners must
be able to depend
implicitly on the word and the behaviour of their colleagues. The judiciary must
have confidence in those who appear
before the courts. The public must have
confidence in the legal profession by reason of the central role the profession
the administration of justice. Many aspects of the administration of
justice depend on the trust by the judiciary and/or the public
performance of professional obligations by professional people.
13 Three principles are particularly significant in this application.
14 First, although the fact of a criminal conviction and sentence is not
necessarily sufficient to disqualify a person from continuing
as a member of the
legal profession, the defects of character revealed by the criminal conduct, and
the disgrace flowing from conviction,
may be incompatible with
Ziems v The Prothonotary of the Supreme Court
of New South Wales
[1957] HCA 46
(1957) 97 CLR 279
especially at 288
(Fullagar J), 298 (Kitto J). That consequence follows more readily in
relation to crimes involving dishonesty and
misappropriation. In
[1947] HCA 53
(1947) 75 CLR 409
at 420, Dixon J observed that a member of
the Bar must:
... command the personal confidence, not only of lay and professional clients,
but of other members of the Bar and of judges. It
would almost seem to go
without saying that conviction of a crime of dishonesty of so grave a kind as
housebreaking and stealing
is incompatible with the existence in a candidate for
admission to the Bar of the reputation and the more enduring moral qualities
denoted by the expression, ‘good fame and character’, which describe
the test of his ethical fitness for the profession.
15 These considerations are not limited to applicants for admission to the Bar;
they apply with equal, if not greater, force to practitioners
who may seek to
work as solicitors, in which capacity they would be entitled to hold trust
moneys on behalf of clients. And an unfitness
to do so may be shown by the
commission of misappropriation offences with less objective seriousness than
crimes such as break, enter
16 Secondly, conduct occurring outside the practice of law may nevertheless
indicate a present unfitness to practice:
(Fullagar J). As explained by Mason P in
New South Wales Bar
Association v Hamman
[1999] NSWCA 404
(1999) 217 ALR 553
The fact that the misconduct is not directly involved with practice in the law
makes no difference where, as is conceded in the present
practitioner’s behaviour would reasonably be regarded as disgraceful and
dishonourable by professional brethren of
good repute and competency
(Allinson v General Council of Medical Education and
Registration
[1894] UKLawRpKQB 36
[1894] 1 QB 750
; Prothonotary of the Supreme Court
of NSW v Costello
[1984] 3 NSWLR 201
17 Mr Hamman’s tax offences were described as involving “significant
and prolonged dishonesty for personal gain”:
at [101]. Repeated
misappropriation from any entity that has entrusted a person with control of its
funds will expose a characteristic
inconsistent with the holding of trust moneys
for clients.
18 Thirdly, fitness to practise requires an appreciation of the high degree of
trust that the court, of necessity, reposes in legal
practitioners and of their
general and ongoing obligation of candour to the court in which they desire to
serve as an “agent
of justice”:
Prothonotary v Montenegro
[2015] NSWCA 409
(Meagher and Leeming JJA and Emmett
Prothonotary v Comeskey
[2018] NSWCA 18
–[31] (Basten JA). That obligation of candour applies especially
in relation to the disclosure of past misconduct that is otherwise
relevant to
fitness to practise. Non-compliance with this obligation may confirm that
defects in character remain or demonstrate
a further inadequacy:
Thomas v Legal Practitioners Admissions Board
[2004] QCA 407
(2005) 1 Qd R
[2004] QCA 407
, where de Jersey CJ observed that “making
candid disclosure of relevant information ... demonstrates a proper perception
[the] duty” and thereby demonstrates good
20. The above principles were recently re-stated by this Court
in the Council of the Law Society of the Australian Capital Territory
[2019] ACTSCFC 1
and the Council of the Law Society of the Australian
Capital Territory v Giles
[2020] ACTSCFC 1.
21. It cannot be the case that a
person capable of behaviour of the type constituting the serious, repeated and
relatively recent
sexual offences, committed by the defendant against students
in respect of whom he was in a position of trust and authority, could
a fit and proper person in whom the public and fellow practitioners could have
trust and upon whom reliance for honest
and honourable conduct could be placed.
The continuing denial of the offences and lying in the witness box re-enforces
this conclusion.
22. The defendant did have a long and distinguished career
as an academic but the credit he receives for this history is overwhelmed
offences and the attendant dishonesty.
23. This Court, almost inevitably,
has reached the conclusion that the defendant is not a fit and proper person to
remain on the roll.
24. The Court makes the following
name of Arthur Marshall Hoyle be removed from the roll of persons admitted to
the legal profession maintained by the Supreme Court
of the Australian Capital
Territory pursuant to
Legal Profession Act 2006
defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the proceedings.
defendant has leave to request an alternate costs order but must do so, in
writing and including submissions, within 14 days of
these orders.
the defendant does make a request for an alternate costs order the plaintiff is
to file any written submissions within 7 days of
receipt of the
defendant’s request. Any issue on costs will then be decided on the
