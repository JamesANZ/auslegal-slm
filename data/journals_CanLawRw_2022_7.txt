The Cadaveric Organ Shortage: a result of Australia’s
organ procurement framework?
Jack Hassall*
Organ donation and transplantation are effective and well-established
treatments, often employed to save lives or significantly improve
life. In Australia, organ donation is a respectable – indeed,
‘noble’ – cause, garnering nation-wide
support. However,
despite Australia’s stated support for organ donation, low levels of
actual organ donation (distinct from
stated intention to donate) fail to keep
abreast with demands for transplantation. With the increased incidence of
lifestyle diseases,
this demand is anticipated to grow exponentially. This
article argues that Australia’s organ donation and transplantation sector
needs significant reform if the supply is to meet the demand. Indeed, the
nation’s low rate of donation is a testament to the
inadequacy of its
current system. A lack of harmonisation in the laws and policy used to regulate
organ and tissue selection, removal
and allocation for transplantation are among
the barriers identified that limit the supply of organs from potential donors.

persisting issue of health policy that has a profound and detrimental effect
upon lives across Australia.

B Methodology
To critically analyse organ donation and transplantation laws and policy in
Australia, this article draws on both qualitative and
quantitative analysis with
a focus on doctrinal and comparative law research methods. A qualitative
approach was imperative to characterising
and comparing legal principles and
practice regarding organ procurement, conducive to discerning the efficacy of
Australia’s
existing regime. A quantitative approach was advantageous in
evaluating the ability of existing governance to increase or decrease
and transplantation rates. The quantitative analysis took the form of a
cross-country statistical assessment of organ donation
and transplantation
and includes statistical

additionally takes on an element of comparative legal analysis by comparing
legislative frameworks on a domestic (that

foreign level (that is Spain’s ‘gold standard’ framework).

Definition and Certification of ‘Death’
Clinical determination and certification of death are essential to the organ

organs may be harvested,
as well as when ‘loss of person hood and individual rights occur, efforts
to preserve life can cease...,
burial or cremation can be undertaken, and
religious or social ceremonies that mark the end of a life can be
Death is foremost a biological state in which cellular activities and organ
function irrevocably cease, indicating that function ‘will

intervention’.
The precise
time of a donor’s death has in the past been a somewhat arbitrary point of
discussion within the donation and transplantation
sector, although its
significance in optimising opportunities to harvest and transplant organs has
remained clear.
Historically,
the common law definition of ‘death’ was in terms of blood

this holding, Part III highlights the use of varying donor eligibility criteria
between state and territory jurisdictions
and, in doing so, establishes this
regime as a ‘constraining factor’ that limits the supply of organs
from potential
donors on a national scale.
Nonetheless, the fundamental constituents of the protocols used to maintain
these criterium are explicated below. This informs the
identification of structural impediments within Australia’s organ donation
and transplantation system that
impede donation and transplantation rates.
Organ Recipient Eligibility Criteria
Evaluating recipient eligibility for transplantation is a two-step process,
involving referral by a specialist clinician of a patient
(usually with end
stage organ disease) to a local ‘multidisciplinary transplant
followed by a
clinical assessment of that patient’s eligibility to be registered on a
transplant waiting list. Clinical assessment
is supervised by the referred to
multidisciplinary transplant unit, which consists of (at a minimum) a
‘suitably experienced’
transplant surgeon and
Referral remains a relatively succinct process, with emphasis placed on
timely referrals to curb increased risk of patient casualty
or harm due to organ
failure. By comparison, clinical assessment comprises an extensive range of
screening tests designed to assess
ongoing patient eligibility for
transplantation.
The following subsections engage with the principal components of the
recipient assessment process, including the general inclusion
and exclusion
appeal protocols,
as well as the provisions for recipient consent to transplantation, and
re-transplantation.
(a) General Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
To remain active on a transplantation waiting list, potential recipients must
attend annual consultations to evaluate ongoing ‘medical,
psychological
and surgical’ eligibility for organ
transplantation.
TSANZ’s clinical guidelines outline inclusion and exclusion criteria for
the transplantation of specified organs, ‘informing
the decision to offer
a particular organ to a particular
recipient’,
general criteria that apply to all transplantable
General criteria
include the ‘presence of age induced comorbidities’,
‘behavioural risk factors’, and an
‘inability to adhere with
complex medical
Although age in of itself is not an exclusion criterion, the presence of
comorbidities in patients over 70 years of age are likely
to ‘exclude the
majority of patients from eligibility for
transplantation’.
Specifically, research indicates a ‘progressive linear increase in
post-transplant mortality with advancing age’ beyond
70 which renders many
recipients ineligible.
Comorbidities may be defined as the presence of two or more distinct conditions
or diseases in an individual,
which result in ‘unacceptably high risks of mortality... during or after
transplantation, more complex clinical management,
and increased health care
In respect of behavioural risk factors, potential organ recipients may be

This is attributed to the existence of a singular transplant unit specialising

engage with the laws for and in relation to patient consent

exclusively by the clinical and ethical
guidelines, and by the common

The exact impact of re-transplantation protocols on donation and
transplantation rates is unknown, as this is not reported in the
literature.
However, common sense would suggest that there exists a relationship between
re-transplantation rates and levels of organ
demand. This relationship warrants
further investigation. Nonetheless, given the limited scope of this article,
attaining and undertaking
an independent qualitative/ quantitative review of
this data is not possible. As a result, this article does not engage with
re-transplantation
protocols when furnishing its recommendations to improve
organ donation and transplantation rates. An identification of the relevant
re-transplantation protocols instead enhances this article’s ability to
identify all aspects of Australia’s organ donation
and transplantation
system, providing context to current standards of medical and procedural
practice within the sector.

clinical guidelines. The ethical

factors within Australia’s donation and transplantation
system that impede
attempts to overcome the organ shortage, meet future demand for organs, and
achieve nation-wide best practice.
The following part of this article
establishes and examines these limiting factors, informed by the works of key
stakeholders within
the area, to explicate their relative impact on donation and
transplantation rates and outcomes. This process informs the article’s
subsequent statement of recommendations to mitigate the impact of structural
impediments within Australia’s system in the areas
most likely to yield
sustainable results over the long-term.

In contrast,
only 16.33% of potential donors in Tasmania were deemed not medically suitable

the presence of HBV and HCV in donor organs has become less of a barrier to

stringent and overly rigorous eligibility criteria that deem sub-optimal organs

Accordingly, Tasmania’s low rate of unsuitability (16.33%) is
attributable to its ‘larger risk appetite and less conservative
to the use of the eligibility criteria’, whereas high unsuitability rates
in Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia
are attributable to the application
of stringent eligibility criteria – evidence which is supported
‘anecdotally’.
Inconsistency in the criteria used between jurisdictions limits the supply of
organs from potential donors on a national scale. There
is potential to access a
much wider pool of donors if this barrier is addressed. This has ramifications
for the article’s recommendations
to improve donation rates, suggesting
that ‘techniques that optimise the use of expanded and nonstandard risk

improve practices in the identification of potential donors’
have a quantifiable and positive impact on ‘Australia’s
performance’.
In application, the contrast drawn between unsuitability rates in Tasmania
and its use of optimised eligibility criteria versus those

this data could be obtained by completing a

hospital officers and transplant unit members). However, given the
narrow scope
of this article and the practical limitations imposed by COVID-19, undertaking
an independent survey or case study of
key stakeholders between state and
territory jurisdictions is not possible; though, this may be explored further in
subsequent research.
Nonetheless, common sense would dictate that key
stakeholders have acted in response to the growing need for donor organs or, at
a fundamental level, to meet government-, hospital- and patient-centric goals.

consent without changes to the [infrastructure] would not increase organ and
tissue donation rates in a
country with a previously implemented opt-in
As a result,

target’ if greater donation gains
could arise ‘through
organisational and structural change’ to Australia’s existing

altruism. It ‘is a precondition of [a donor’s]

only ethically just response to donation appears to be one that adheres to an
informed consent system (that is an opt-in
More recently, the Australian government commissioned Ernst and Young (EY) to
undertake an independent review of organ and tissue
donation in Australia to
provide ‘recommendations and evidence-based advice to inform the
development of a future national
strategy... in order to optimise deceased
donation opportunities for maximum transplant

commencing in May 2018 and published December 2018, highlighted the need for
improvements in governance transparency

in the sector.
reference to the use of an opt-out system as a viable or sustainable solution to
achieving increased rates of donation
within Australia. This, alongside the
prior mentioned reports and reviews, signals a noteworthy shift within the organ
donation and
transplantation sector, indicating that key stakeholders are
orientating their legislative- and policy-centric goals to developing
capacitating Australia's existing opt-in system.
On the balance, although opt-out systems are objectively the benchmark in
organ and tissue donation statistics, ‘[this] clinically
focused... system
is something Australians are not ready or prepared for’ – reflected
in Australia’s current political
climate and the reduced readiness of key
stakeholders to comment on or to consider its
endorsement.

superficial,

ramifications for the article’s subsequent recommendations to improve
donation rates, suggesting that there exists
far more potential to achieve
greater donation gains ‘through organisational and structural
change’, rather than through
the enactment of opt-out
legislation.
IV Rethinking Organ Donation: recommendations for
A review of the laws and policy underpinning organ donation and
transplantation practices in Australia, informed by the ideas of leading
academics and researchers that have produced work in this area, identified
several constraining factors that impede attempts to overcome
shortage, meet future organ demand, and achieve nation-wide best practice.
Accordingly, the following part provides evidence-based
recommendations, comprising wide-ranging legislative and infrastructural reform,
to overcome these constraining factors
in the areas most likely to yield
measurable and sustainable increases in donation and transplantation rates in
the long-term. All
recommendations endorse a key principle adopted by the Howard
Government’s National Taskforce in its 2008 report: ‘think
nationally, act
A Recommendation #1: legislative harmonisation
A key finding of this article was that Australia lacked authoritative
Commonwealth oversight. As a result, the provisions for and
in relation to organ
donation and transplantation are furnished on a state and territory level
– a ‘fragmented’
form of governance. Inconsistency between
state and territory laws reduces Australia’s ability to increase donation
and transplantation
rates, remain current to changing practices within the
and has precipitated
gaps within the law that disempower government authorities to oversight
Consequently, this article recommends that there exists a shared
responsibility for the amalgamation and implementation of nationally
Commonwealth organ donation and transplantation law between state and territory
for state and territory
governments and other key stakeholders to co-contribute to and deliver on organ
and tissue services in a
manner that best suits jurisdictional and national
environments – consistent with the Taskforce’s desire to
nationally, act
harmonisation of the law to generate Commonwealth oversight would allow for
consistency between jurisdictions and would
streamline the future introduction
or revision of the provisions in relation to organ donation and transplantation.
Theoretically,
this would ensure all jurisdictions remain current to best
practice procedure.
B Recommendation #2: licensing system registration trials
A second finding was that South Australia continues to report the highest
proportion of donor registrations, and that this may be
attributed to its use of
a niche licensing legacy system (operating in conjunction with the AODR). By
comparison, it was determined
that the use of the AODR in
hampers registration rates in jurisdictions such as the Northern Territory,
Victoria, and Queensland.
Accordingly, it is recommended that discussions between state and territory
governments and stakeholders be opened to inform the revision
and implementation
of strategies to improve nation-wide donor registrations, having regard for the
merits of South Australia’s
licensing arrangements. As a part of this
discussion, state and territory governments and stakeholders should be urged to
independent, regional studies regarding the effects of licensing
arrangements on registration rates and to subsequently present their
conclusions
before the other relevant parties – consistent with the notion of
‘think nationally, act
These studies
should include licensing system trials that run for a minimum of six months.
This time frame ensures that trials and
their results are not constrained by
logistical factors including time – as informed by the Australian Red
Cross Lifeblood’s
1990 campaign ‘Go On! Say Yes’ which
evaluated the ‘level of increase or decrease in donor consent rates’
over six months following the implementation of drivers’ license
registration
arrangements.
C Recommendation #3: eligibility criteria harmonisation
A third finding of this article was that donor eligibility criteria are
inconsistent between state and territory jurisdictions. Variability
criteria used to assess donor eligibility negatively impacts Australia’s
mean donation rate and, additionally, prevents
Australia from achieving the
‘nationally uniform’ criteria espoused for in TSANZ’s clinical
guidelines.
Accordingly, Tasmania’s use of optimised eligibility criteria was
observed to increase its risk appetite; therefore, lowering
unsuitability rates. This boosts the nation’s average donation rate.
Conversely, jurisdictions using overly stringent
and rigorous criteria reported
increased unsuitability rates. This hampers the nation’s average donation
Therefore, this article recommends that TSANZ undertake a review and revision
of the national standards for determining donor eligibility,
having regard for
the efficacy and merit of Tasmania’s eligibility criteria. Subsequently,
it is recommended that Tasmania’s
eligibility criteria be trialled in
other state and territory jurisdictions and, if proven effective, implemented
nation-wide. As
such, it is hypothesised that the introduction of
Tasmania’s eligibility regime would coincide with decreasing unsuitability
rates and, by extension, increasing donation rates.
D Recommendation #4: rebutting presumed consent (opt-out)
This article’s final key finding determined that Australia may overcome
the organ shortage, meet future demand for organs, and
achieve nation-wide best
practice by orientating reform to capacitating Australia’s existing opt-in
system, and not by moving
to an opt-out system of donation. Indeed, focusing on
reform away from an opt-in system and towards an opt-out system without
corresponding
infrastructural and legal reform ‘would not increase
donation rates’ in
Hence, this article recommends against the introduction of an opt-out system
of donation. Furthermore, it supports the continued capacitation
Australia’s existing opt-in system and has subsequently orientated its
recommendations to reflect this.
V How to Proceed: strategic roadmap to reform
The OTA is best placed to lead the dissemination and implementation of this
article’s recommendations across state and territory
Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority Act
(Cth) provides the OTA with responsibility for the formulation,
supervision and dissemination of ‘policies..., protocols’
information ‘relating to organ or tissue donation and transplantation
For the OTA to extend the ambit of its focus to embrace the enhanced
governance of organ donation and transplantation, and to drive
implementation of this article’s recommendations, the OTA will
‘require adequate funding and support from the Australian
Government’.
Theoretically, funding and support for the implementation of this
article’s recommendations may be obtained where the Australian
recognises Australia’s organ donation and transplantation sector as an
area of law that ‘needs to be updated,
improved or
developed’.
occurs, the Attorney-General may issue a written request to the ALRC to
undertake an inquiry with respects to the deficient
area of law – referred
to as a Terms of Reference (TOR). The TOR addresses the subject matter and scope
of the inquiry, including
the stakeholders and advisory committee consulted
during the investigation.
Following an initial inquiry and consultation, the ALRC will produce several
‘Consultation Documents’, comprising ‘Background
and ‘Consultation Papers’. Background Papers will provide a detailed
account of the ALRC’s research,
while Consultation Papers will set out
draft proposals for reform and will call for public submissions, including
academic research

Through the
submissions it receives, the ALRC can gauge public opinion with respects to the
law under investigation which ultimately
informs the ALRC in the formulation of
its ‘final report’. This report may culminate in law reform
following tabling
Parliament.
In giving effect to this process, the intention is to galvanise official and
public discussion regarding organ procurement through
publication of this
research in a public forum, and in submitting a concise variation of this
research to state and territory Health
Ministers. The hope is that this will
encourage the Australian Government to recognise the structural impediments and
corresponding
recommendations identified in this article, insofar as to issue a
TOR to the ALRC for a formal inquiry into Australia’s organ
donation and
transplantation sector. Subsequent steps required to translate this
article’s recommendations into legislative
and policy reform may include
academic submissions to the ALRC following the issuance of ‘Consultation
On the balance, this article serves to encourage official powers within the
Australian Government and organ procurement sector to
Australia’s failing organ donation and transplantation system, and to
subsequently manage its shortcomings.
According to Luc Delriviere, Senior Liver Transplant and Hepato-biliary
Surgeon at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital (WA), legal reform
of this magnitude
may take upwards of two to three
As such, it was
imperative to develop a clear strategy and endgame for reform when synthesising
this article’s recommendations.
VI Concluding Remarks
Australia’s organ donation and transplantation sector is in need of
significant reform if the supply is to ever meet the demand.
The nation’s
low rate of donation (21.6 dpmp) is a testament to the inadequacy of its current
system. A lack of harmonisation
in the laws and policy used to regulate the
selection, removal and allocation of organs and tissue for transplantation are
the barriers identified in this article that limit the supply of organs
from donors. This article’s legal and administrative
critique indicates
that a much wider pool of donor organs may be accessed if these barriers are
addressed. Accordingly, this article
has provided evidence-based advice and
recommendations to overcome and grapple with these barriers.
In line with its aims, this article has additionally identified a viable
reform process to translate its recommendations into legislative
reform. In giving effect to this process, the intention is to foster public
discussion through publication of this article
in a public forum, and in
providing a concise variation of this research to state and territory Health
However, readers of this article would be misguided if they are led to
believe that reform is easily obtainable. This article is one
step down the path
to achieving a ‘gold-standard’ organ donation and transplantation
system capable of overcoming the
organ shortage, meeting future demand for
organs, and achieving nation-wide best practice. To enact change and meet the
demand, Australians
nation-wide are called upon to recognise the inadequacy of
our current system and, in doing so, advocate for change in hopes that
‘relatively scarce resource’ becomes ever more accessible to those
suffering life threatening disease(s).
