Refunds for lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed tobacco (BF-005) [1996] VICSROBF 1 (30 April 1996)
Revenue Rulings
The State Revenue Office is sometimes asked to
refund licence fees relating to tobacco that has been
lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed.
Licence fees are payable under the
Business Franchise
(Tobacco) Act 1974
(the Act) by wholesalers or
retailers based on sales and purchases (respectively)
of tobacco products. The invoices in these
transactions often display a separate figure itemising
ad valorem fees
. This figure is passed on to the
buyer as a component of the price. This practice
sometimes leads buyers to assume that the amount
can be separately recouped from the State Revenue
Office in the event of product loss.
The Act imposes a licence fee on tobacco
wholesalers and retailers. The fee includes an
amount which is calculated on the basis of sales or
purchases of tobacco during a specified relevant
period. The payment of a licence fee is made in
exchange for the issue of a licence to operate as a
wholesaler or retailer of tobacco in Victoria.
The payment is not made to meet a tax liability
arising directly from the sale or purchase of tobacco.
The State Revenue Office will not refund licence fees
to wholesalers, retailers or consumers for tobacco
they have bought or sold which was subsequently
stolen, lost, damaged or destroyed.
Please note that rulings do not have the force of law.
Each decision made by the State Revenue Office is
made on the merits of each individual case having
regard to any relevant ruling. All rulings must be
read subject to Revenue Ruling GEN.01.
