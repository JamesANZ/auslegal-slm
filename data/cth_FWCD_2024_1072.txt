MELBOURNE, 23 DECEMBER 2024
Alteration of other rules of organisation.
On 8 October 2024 the Victoria Police Branch of the Police Federation
of Australia (the Branch) lodged with the Fair Work Commission
(the Commission)
a notice and declaration setting out particulars of alterations to its rules.
Further information in support of
the alterations was provided on 29 November
2024 and 18 December 2024.
The Branch seeks certification of the alterations under section 159
Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009
The particulars set out alterations to Branch Rules 52CA, 52CB, 52CC,
52CD, 52CE, 52CF, 52CG, 52CH, 52CI, 52CJ, 52CK, 52CL, 52CM,
52CN, 52CO, 52CP,
52CQ, 52CW and 52CX.
On the information contained in the notice, declaration and further
information provided in support of the alterations, I am satisfied
alterations have been made under the rules of the organisation.
On 18 December 2024, the Branch withdrew the alterations to Subrule
52CD(6). The alteration to this subrule is therefore no longer
before me for
consideration.
The alterations to Rules 52CA, 52CB, 52CC, 52CD, 52CE, 52CF, 52CG,
52CH, 52CI, 52CJ, 52CK, 52CL, 52CM, 52CN (with the exception of
52CN(1)(b)), 52CO, 52CQ, 52CW and 52CX are minor and uncontroversial. They are
introduce gender
neutral language;
update the means
for communicating electronically;
location to publish reports regarding Branch Executive meetings;
expression and grammar;
legislation references; and
set out the
personnel authorised to execute Industrial Agreements.
The above alterations are uncontroversial. They do not require
comment beyond expressing my opinion about the matters set out in subsection
159(1) of the
Authorisation of expenditure
The alterations to Subrules 52CN(1)(b) and 52CP(3) and the deletion
of Subrule 52CP(4) transfer the Branch’s payment method
from cheque to
electronic bank transfer. Consequentially, the Treasurer would no longer
authorise payments by cheque, but instead
ensure all authorised payments are
conducted electronically.
Under current Subrule 52CP(4) cheques must be signed by two
authorised personnel (including officers) of the Branch. The deletion
subrule removes the requirement for dual authorisation.
Although the Act does not require payments from funds to be
authorised by two persons at the time the payments are made, the deletion
this subrule may provide the opportunity for a person to withdraw funds without
appropriate oversight. Therefore, the deletion,
on its face, has the potential
to diminish good governance.
On 8 October 2024, the Branch submitted
“The [Branch] advises electronic payments used by the
organisation require dual authorisation.”
I also note that the rules require authorisation of expenditure by
either the Branch President or the Branch Executive prior to withdrawal
The rules also
require the Treasurer to ensure that authorised payments are made by electronic
bank transfer.
Considering the existence of the pre-approval and the dual
authorisation system for electronic payments, I am satisfied that oversight
expenditure appears to be appropriately monitored and that good governance
systems have been maintained.
Typographical, clerical or formal errors
On 18 December 2024, the Branch President, Karl David, gave consent
under subsection 159(2) of the Act for me to make various amendments
alterations for the purpose of correcting typographical, clerical or formal
errors. Accordingly, the following corrections
have been made:
In proposed
Subrule 52CD(5), removed the duplicated “The”; and
In proposed
Subrule 52CW(2), inserted a missing full-stop.
In my opinion, the alterations comply with and are not contrary to
the Act, the
Fair Work Act 2009
, modern awards and enterprise agreements,
are not otherwise contrary to law and were made under the rules of the
organisation. I
certify accordingly under subsection 159(1) of the Act.
DELEGATE OF THE GENERAL MANAGER
Subsection 159(1)
of the Act provides that:
alteration of the rules (other than the eligibility rules) of an organisation
does not take effect unless particulars of the alteration
have been lodged with
the FWC and the General Manager has certified that, in his or her opinion, the
alteration:
(a) complies with, and is not contrary to, this Act, the
Fair Work Act
, modern awards and enterprise agreements; and
(b) is not otherwise contrary to law; and
(c) has been made under the rules of the organisation.
