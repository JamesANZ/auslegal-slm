Relevant exemptions under the FOI Act
The following sections of the FOI Act are relevant to my decision:
Section 28(1)(b)
of the FOI Act – this section provides that information cannot be released
if it was prepared by a Minister,
or on behalf of a Minister, or by an agency,
for the purpose of submitting it to Cabinet for Cabinet’s consideration.
Section 28(1)(c)
of the FOI Act – this section provides that a document that is a copy or
draft of, or contains extracts from
Cabinet documents cannot be released. This
includes copies, drafts or extracts from:
official record of any deliberation or decision of the Cabinet

agency, for the purpose of submitting it to Cabinet
for Cabinet’s
consideration
document that was prepared for a Minister to brief them about an issue to be
considered by the Cabinet.
Section 32 of
the FOI Act – this section provides that documents subject to legal
professional privilege or client legal privilege
Reasons for decision
I have conducted a review of the decision made by the Agency and made a fresh
decision as follows under section 49P of the FOI Act.
– memorandum of advice
I am satisfied this document is
exempt in full under section 32(1) of the FOI Act.
It cannot be released to you because it is a memorandum of legal advice. It
is a confidential communication between the client, being
the Agency, and their
lawyers that was made for the dominant purpose of providing legal advice.
I do not agree with your view that legal professional privilege has been
waived, because I consider the substance of the legal advice
was not disclosed
by the Premier in her interview with ABC Radio Melbourne on 3 August
– submission to a Cabinet committee
I am satisfied that
this document is exempt in full under section 28(1)(b) of the FOI Act.
The document is a submission to a Cabinet committee for its consideration.
This was the sole purpose of the document.
– draft submission proposal
I am satisfied that this
document is exempt in full under section 28(1)(c) of the FOI Act.
The document is a draft submission to a Cabinet committee for its
consideration. It is a draft of Document 2, and I am satisfied Document
exempt under section 28(1)(b) of the FOI Act.
– draft briefing
I am satisfied this document is exempt
in full under section 28(1)(c) of the FOI Act.
I have viewed extrinsic documents provided by the Agency which confirm that
this a draft of a briefing to a Minister in relation to
a matter to be
considered by the Cabinet.
It is not practicable to edit the documents to delete information that is
prohibited from release as the required deletions would
make the documents
meaningless. As such, I have decided to refuse access to the documents in full.
Your review rights
If you are not satisfied with my decision, you can apply to the Victorian
Civil and Administrative Tribunal (
) for it to be reviewed.
