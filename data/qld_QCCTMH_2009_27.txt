REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
Pty Ltd (“the applicant”), the park owner applies for an order
confirming a proposed rental increase for the
51 residents listed in the
application. This application is made pursuant to the
Manufactured Homes
(Residential Parks) Act 2003
(“MHRP Act”), section 71(7).
amended list of 46 respondents who had signed the document consenting to the
proposed defence was tendered as exhibit one.
applicant is the owner of the Bribie Pines Island Village (“the
Park”) located at Goodwin Drive, Bribie Island. The
park, developed in
stages over many years, comprise 207 manufactured home sites and is described as
an over 50s residential village.
The residents occupy their sites pursuant to
site agreements and there are three different versions of site agreements in
Two versions of these site agreements were used prior to the
enactment of the MHPR Act and they do not contain a clause allowing
for a market
review rental increase but contain an annual CPI increase in rent clause only.
The site agreements entered into since
the enactment of the MHRP Act 2003
contain an annual CPI rental adjustment clause and a three year market review
are 96 residents who occupy their sites pursuant to site agreements that do not
contain a market review provision and there
are 111 residents who occupy their
sites pursuant to site agreements that do contain a market review provision.
207 manufactured homes sites are designated as either inside or outside sites.
The outside or outer sites are described as sites
that are located on the outer
perimeter of the Park and are adjacent to a nature reserve or are sites that are
located inside the
park but are larger in size. The inner sites are those
smaller sites located on the inner areas of the park and are not described
outer sites. The rents payable for the sites vary and the rents payable for
inner sites are slightly lower then that paid for
the outer sites; for inner
sites the rents varied from $115.20 to $120.75 and for outer sites the rents
varied from $120.75 to $126.30
or about 29 July 2008, the applicant served a notice of rental increase pursuant
to section 71(4) of the MHRP Act on the 96 homeowners
who resided in the park
pursuant to site agreements that did not contain a market review provision.
applicant also desired that the rental paid for each site owner should be
identical except that the rent for an inner site should
be lower than for an
outer site. The notices provided for an increase in rental for the inner sites
to $124.50 and for the outer
sites to $129.00 per week. Therefore, to achieve
an equal rental the amount of the increase varied slightly between the
Of the outer sites, 26 have had a proposed increase in rent of
$8.25 and three sites had a proposed increase of $2.70 per week.
With respect
to the inside sites, 22 sites have a proposed market review rental increase of
$9.30 per week.
copy of a notice dated 29 July 2008 provides:
Notice of increase in site rent (market
review 2008) section 71 –
Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act
We are writing to advise that it is proposed to increase your site rent
of the above Act. Your last market review was 2005. While we
realise that increase site fees are never popular, we have tried to
keep them as
low and affordable as possible. We have engaged a professional valuer to make
an assessment and he considers Bribie
Pines Island Village rents to be
acceptable market rent of $130.00 inside and $130.00 per week outside.
(A) We wish to increase your site rent of $120.75 to $124.50 per week,
representing an increase of $3.75 per week. This new site
rent is the proposed
increase site rent for the purpose of this notice.
(B) The proposed increased site rent has been calculated on the following
basis and taking into consideration the factors listed below.
While the listed
of information is not exhaustive, it is indicative of the market pressures that
have led to this increase.
rent charged in comparable parks:
# the company
and our valuer have conducted an examination of other parks in the area,
including current rent, whether or not a recent
market review had been
undertaken, the amenities offered and the services provided.
# Market rents payable in our village on comparable sites.
The increase day will be the day the proposed increase site rent ($124.50)
is first payable which is two (2) months after you receive
this notice i.e. 1
October 2008. If the date last nominated is a day earlier that two (2)
months after the date this notice
is given then the increase day will be two (2)
months after the day this notice is given to you.
If no agreement is reached in relation to the proposed increase within
twenty eight (28) days from the delivery of this notice then
park owner may
apply to the Tribunal for an order in relation to the proposed
the 96 residents who were given a section 71 notice, 45 have accepted the
proposed increase in rent and 51 have either not accepted
or have not provided a
written response indicating whether they have agreed with the proposed increase
or not. The home owners in
this latter category are deemed to have not agreed
pursuant to section 71(6) of the MHRP Act.
section 69 notice of a market review rental increase was also issued to the 111
residents who occupy their sites pursuant to agreements
that contain a market
review clause. All these 111 residents have accepted the rental increase.
applicant originally sought an order confirming the increase in rental against
the 51 respondents but due to changes in circumstances
for some home owners the
order is now being sought against the 46 respondents listed in exhibit one.
Applicant’s submissions
applicant submitted that they are entitled to a market review increase in rental
as the factors listed in section 70 (3) have
been complied with and the proposed
rental increase was fair and reasonable.
The applicant invited the Tribunal to accept the evidence of the valuer, Mr
Stanaway and submitted that his evidence was un-contradicted
and the criticism
of him should not be accepted. Mr Stanaway’s evidence is that the market
value of the inner sites is $130.00
and for the outer is $135.00. It was also
submitted that the proposed market review rental increase was substantially less
the market rent. Further evidence of the market rent is that new residents
now coming into the Park pay $138.50 per week.
applicant says that the submissions by the respondents that the amenities at the
park have been reduced are wrong and these false
assertions include: the staff
pay less attention and have less responsibility for the Park as they are now
responsible for the Island
Breeze Resort; the new amenities block caters for the
Park and the Island Breeze Resort, whereas, previously it was only for the
there has been a loss of amenity due to the addition of 57 sites; the condition
of the Park and the furnishings are of a poor
and unsatisfactory standard and
the pool is inadequate.
applicant is also seeking to bring all the rents payable up to the same level
for accounting convenience and for reasons of equity.
The applicant submitted
that the rental increases from $2.70 to $9.30 per site are reasonable.
Respondents’ submissions
respondents submitted that the evidence of Mr Stanaway is dubious, is based on
errors, is not independent, is biased and should
not be accepted. They submitted
that his report was prepared for the benefit of the park owner after he was
taken on a guided tour.
the applicant should not be permitted to claim a market review increase as the
contract expressly provides for an annual
CPI increase only. Any market review
increase is contrary to the terms of the contract, is unfair and inequitable.
The main concern of the self represented respondents is the conduct of the
applicant’s managers and the staff. The managers
and staff were described
as being unapproachable, rude, abusive and aggressive with a poor attitude
towards the residents. Also
they do not attend functions and have not submitted
articles for publication in the Park magazine.
They also submitted that the services and the amenities at the Park have
declined especially the swimming pool and other amenities
have been removed.
Mr Besford submitted that there has been a reduction in costs and not an
increase and an increase in rent was not fair and equitable.
respondents complained about the new amenities block: the noise from the
construction site next door: the neglect by management
and staff who are
spending most of their time on the new project next door: the failure to carry
out repairs and maintenance: the
increased distance that they have to walk to
the new office: and the rubbish collection service has declined.
The respondents submitted that the proposed rental increase should be set aside
or reduced.
Observations and findings
respondents submitted that the applicant should not be entitled to a market
review rental increase as the site agreements expressly
provide for a CPI rental
increase only. This argument was dealt with by the District Court Judge in
Palmpoint Pty Ltd v The Residents of Bribie Pines Island Village [2007]
where his honour held that the applicant was entitled to seek a
market review increase in rental, notwithstanding the site agreements
for a CPI increase only. This Tribunal is bound by this decision.
next issue concerns the criticism of Mr Stanaway, the valuer. Mr Stanaway is a
valuer with a long and extensive experience in
valuing site rentals and other
properties. It was his opinion that the market value for outer sites was
$135.00 per week and the
market value for the inner sites $130.00 per week. The
respondents submitted that his report was biased as he was taken on a guided
tour by Mr Forrester and his opinion was not independent. I reject this
submission. It is reasonable and proper for Mr Forrester
to show the engaged
valuer around the Park. It was the valuer’s obligation to view and make
his own observations of the Park,
to reflect and give an independent opinion as
to the market value of the site rents. This is what he did and I accept the
that the report of Mr Stanaway is an independent valuation.
respondents submitted that Mr Stanaway relied on the rental paid at Island
Breeze Resort to form his opinion. Mr Stanaway referred
to the rentals paid at
the Resort of between $126.00 and $130.00 per week but this new park was not
noted as one of the comparable
parks that were adopted when assessing the site
rental. I accept the submission of the respondents that Island Breeze Resort is
not a comparable park and it should not be used in assessing the market rents at
the Park. It is a neighbouring park, it is owned
by Palmpoint and it shares the
administration and other facilities at the Park. It is not a comparable park
and cannot be considered
when assessing the market rents. Mr Stanaway referred
to the Maroochy River Cabin Village, The Maroochydore Palms Holiday Village,
Edgewater Village, Forrest Glen Resort Village, and Bindawalla Gardens/Kurrajong
Sanctuary. All these parks are located in the coastal
tourist strip of the
Sunshine Coast and I accept that these parks are comparable parks in the
locality. A comparable park does not
mean that the park is identical in every
respect. The services and facilities offered at the parks vary slightly but
they must be
manufactured home parks offering similar facilities. I accept that
these parks are comparable parks in the locality and can be taken
into account
in determining what the market rental is for the Park.
Stanaway agreed with the proposition that the facilities offered at Forrest Glen
and Edgewater Village Park were superior in some
respects and had additional
facilities. I also accept that Mr Stanaway had not visited the Edgewater Village
Park but gained the
information about the park from elsewhere. However, the fact
that the facilities at the parks differ does not mean that the parks
comparable. It simply means that the additional facilities must be taken into
account when determining the market rent for
the Park. Further, the fact that Mr
Stanaway did not visit the park does not mean he cannot obtain the relevant
facts from elsewhere
to form the view that Edgewater Village Park was a
comparable park.
Furthermore,
the respondents’ submission concerning Mr Stanaway’s evidence was
confusing. On the one hand, they were
critical of his report but on the other
did not tender any evidence to support a contrary valuation. The only evidence
market rental at the Park is that presented by Mr Stanaway. His
evidence is uncontested on this issue. I accept his evidence of
the valuation
of the sites at the Park as $130.00 for inside sites and $135.00 for outside
next issue to consider is provided for in section 70(3)(b) of the MHRP Act,
namely, the increase in site rent compared to the
previous site rent. The
rentals that were previously payable varied slightly. For the outside sites the
rents were mainly $120.75
though some were $126.30. Therefore the increase
varied from $8.25 or $2.70 to bring the proposed increase to $129.00. For the
inside sites the rents were mainly $115.20, with an increase of $9.30 to bring
the rentals to $124.50.
next issue concerns the frequency and the amount of past increases in the site
rents payable under the agreements. In September
2005 a market review occurred,
in July 2006, 2007, 2008 a CPI increase was claimed and finally in September
2009 a further CPI increase
of 3.1% was claimed. The respondents submitted that
the three increases over 14 months (July 08, this market review, September 2009)
is unfair and inequitable. To the contrary, the applicant says that the market
rent was $130.00 and $135.00 respectively which is
a rental still over and above
that which is being claimed after the three increases. They submit that the
rent now claimed even
after the recent 2009 CPI increase is $134.20 and $129.55
respectively. He said he only claimed a small increase in rent as he knew
the following CPI would bring the rent up to the market rent. I accept the
evidence of the applicant on this issue. If the
September 2009 CPI increase had
raised the rent beyond the market rental the submission by the respondents would
have been substantially
strengthened. As the rental, even after the recent CPI
increase, is below the market rent, I am of the view that the submission
respondents does not carry significant weight.
next issue concerns the amenity or standard of the common areas and communal
facilities. The respondents say that the facilities
were of a poor standard,
but the applicant says to the contrary. The applicant also relies on statements
by Joseph Codianni to support
the proposition that the Park is in an above
average condition.
get the clear impression that the relationship between the four self-represented
respondents and the management and staff engaged
by the applicant is so affected
or poisoned that the evidence on many of these issues has been coloured or
adversely affected. A
good example was the evidence of Mr Tumath when he made a
complaint about a nine cent overcharge for electricity. He made a complaint
the office as he believed that if a nine cent overcharge was made on every
invoice the amount of money recovered by the applicant
would be significant.
But Mr Tumath complained to the office about this overcharge and he described
the response as “
very aggressive
she said she
too busy and hasn’t got time
”. Mr Tumath was very
critical of the attitude of the staff at the park and said that they should
participate more in social
activities and when he was editor of the magazine the
Park never donated an article for publication. Second, Mr Wells said that
of the office staff were rude and unapproachable, though he agreed that
complaints had been made about him with respect to people
management issues. He
admitted he called the previous manager a liar and there were allegations made
by his neighbour about intimidation.
evidence by the four separate respondents supports a conclusion that a strained
relationship exists between them and the staff.
However, it does not support a
conclusion that the relationship between the staff and the other 205 site
residents were equally affected.
In a park with over 300 residents, it would be
unusual if there was never any conflict between some of the residents and the
at some point in time. I am not able, and it is not necessary to make
findings about these issues and about who was responsible for
this failure in
the relationship. The fact that there is some conflict between these four
respondents and the applicant and its
staff is not a significant factor to take
into account when considering the rental increase issue.
respondents allege the swimming pool is too small for the number of residents at
the park, and the kitchen and toilet facilities
in the recreational room are
inadequate. The concrete pool is 15 metres by 10 metres in size, is almost six
feet deep in the centre
and has a concrete step at one end for people to use
when climbing out of the pool. It does not have a ladder for residents to use.
The respondents say the pool is too small and it should have a ladder to aid the
elderly people to get out of the pool. The respondents
criticize the size of the
pool, especially when there are over 300 residents and the inadequate access to
and from the pool for the
mature age residents. This pool was installed over a
decade ago and it is not unusual for pools of this type to have a concrete
There is no evidence of the extent of the use of the pool and whether too many
people wish to use the pool at one time. There
was one statement that the pool
was rarely used by more than two or three persons at any one time. In these
circumstances, I am
not able to make any findings as to whether or not the pool
size was adequate or not for the number of residents available at the
to the concrete step, it is a normal construction method in concrete pools and
what ever type of step was installed, mature
aged and elderly people would have
difficulty in climbing out of the pool. Many elderly people have difficulty when
they are required
to pull or carry their own weight. I also reject the
criticism that the pool was not heated, as the cost to heat the pool is
considerable.
I also reject the criticism of the kitchen, though it is small and
has been used for a long period of time.
also was a complaint that the boom gate was not working adequately, though Mr
Besford did concede that the gate has been operating
properly in recent times.
Further, there was also criticism that security has declined, and to the
contrary, the respondent says
that somebody is on site at all times, either the
manager or their representative. I accept the evidence of the respondents on
issue and I find that the managers of the Park are nearly always available
and if they are not available an employee or another person
is available.
next issue concerns the withdrawal of services and facilities. The respondents
submitted that a table tennis table and croquet
facilities have been removed,
the swimming pool is now shared by additional residents so the swimming facility
has declined; the
administration block and office staff are now shared with the
new Breeze Resort. These issues, it is submitted, is evidence of a
service. As for the croquet table the respondent says that the table is in the
cupboard and can be used if people want
to use it but it is never used. As for
the table tennis table, Mr Forrester said it was in poor condition, was
unsightly and was
not owned by the Park and was disposed of. As for the use of
the administration block and staff time, the respondent says that the
Breeze resort use the administration block and previously the administration
block was used jointly by the Park and the Caravan
Park. The Island Breeze
Resort is being constructed on the former Caravan Park site. The applicant
maintains that the amenities
at the Park have stayed the same and I accept the
evidence on this issue. I find that the furniture at the recreational facility
has been replaced with new furniture but this is not a significant issue. I
also accept that the boom gate was broken and was damaged
when hit by a vehicle
but has now been satisfactorily repaired and I accept that the manager or his
representative is available on
site at all times. I find that there has been no
significant withdrawal or addition to the facilities at the Park.
was a submission that the costs have declined because of a reduced number of
staff. This statement by the respondent was a
speculative comment only and
there is no definitive evidence on this issue. There is no evidence of a
reduction or an increase in
final issue concerns what is fair and equitable. It was submitted that it was
not fair to increase the rentals when the site agreement
provides for a CPI
increase only. As stated above the applicants are lawfully entitled to bring
this application and they have done
was also submitted that some of the residents are pensioners and cannot afford
the increase. I accept the submission that any
rent increase has an impact on
residents, especially for fixed income pensioners. On the other hand, some
residents are in a stronger
financial position and none of the four
self-represented home owners gave detailed evidence of an inability to pay the
increase in
rent. This issue must also be weighed against the principle that
the park owner is entitled to receive a dividend from his investment.
all these factors into account I am satisfied that the applicant is entitled to
a market review rental increase as proposed.
I accept that the amount claimed
is not excessive and is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.
final issue is to determine when this increase should take place. The notice of
the increase was issued in July 2008 and was to
take effect on 1 October 2008.
Many of the residents accepted the proposed increase and 51 objected. The
respondents have challenged
the proposed increase with determination and made
two applications in the proceedings to the Tribunal which had the effect of
the application. In the first application it was argued the Tribunal
did not have jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter
and more recently
there was an application for disclosure of the respondents’ financial
accounts. Both of these applications
were unsuccessful.
I am satisfied that it would be inequitable and unfair if the increase was not
to take effect at the same time as for the other residents
who did not oppose
the increase. Furthermore, if the applications within the application were not
filed a determination of this
matter would have taken place many months ago. In
these circumstances the increase should take effect as and from 1 October
proposed site rent increase for the outside sites to $129.00 and the proposed
site rental increase for the inside sites to $124.50
be affirmed and the
proposed rental increase to take place from the 1 October 2008.
