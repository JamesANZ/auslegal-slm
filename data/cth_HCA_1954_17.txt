APPEAL from the Supreme Court of Tasmania.
April 23, 1954.
THE COURT delivered the following written judgment:-
The appellant was the plaintiff in an action in the Supreme Court of
Tasmania against the respondent as executor of the respective
wills of Olinda
Gibbons deceased and Ethel Rose Gibbons deceased. The plaintiff sought in the
action to establish a title, as the
last survivor of three joint tenants,
Olinda Gibbons, Ethel Rose Gibbons and herself, to an estate in fee simple in
possession in
two parcels of land situate respectively in Liverpool Street and
Park Street, Hobart. After a trial before Morris C.J. and a jury
the plaintiff
obtained judgment, but on appeal the judgment was set aside by the Full Court.
From the Full Court's order the plaintiff
now appeals to this Court. (at p435)
2. The title to the land in Park Street and part of the land in Liverpool
Street is under the provisions of the
Real Property Act
and the title to the
remainder of the land in Liverpool Street is governed by the general law.
Until 4th April 1943, the fee simple
in the lands of both descriptions was
vested in Olinda Gibbons and Ethel Rose Gibbons, who were sisters, and their
brother Gustav
Gibbons, as joint tenants. On that date the brother died. On
3rd July of the same year, the sisters, pursuant to a covenant to do
entered into on 14th April 1943, conveyed the land under the general law, and
transferred the land under the
Real Property Act
to themselves and the
appellant (who is Gustav's widow) as joint tenants. Shortly afterwards,
however, they purported to sever the
joint tenancy thus created. As to the
land under the general law, each sister on 11th October 1944 mortgaged her
interest to a solicitor,
who happens to be the respondent, by means of a deed
of conveyance with a proviso for redemption, to secure a loan of 10 pounds.
to the land under the
Real Property Act
, the sisters on 6th December 1945
executed a memorandum of transfer (subsequently duly
registered) whereby each
transferred to the
other her one-third share in the joint tenancy in
consideration of a similar transfer
by the other to her. (at p435)
3. If these instruments took effect according to their terms, they were
effectual to sever the joint tenancy and to cause the lands
to be vested in
the three ladies as tenants in common in equal shares: Wright v. Gibbons
[1949] HCA 3
; (1949) 78 CLR 313. But Ethel
Rose Gibbons
having died in January 1946, and
Olinda Gibbons having died in November of the same year,
the appellant claims
proceedings
that for want of mental capacity on the part of each
sister the mortgages and memorandum
of transfer were ineffectual
the joint tenancy, and that accordingly the appellant is now solely entitled
to the lands
by survivorship. (at p436)
4. At the trial the learned Chief Justice of Tasmania left four questions to
the jury. The first two related to the instruments
of 14th April 1943 and 3rd
July 1943 as a result of which the appellant had come to be a joint tenant
with Olinda and Ethel Rose
in the subject lands, and the answers to those
questions denied that certain suggested grounds existed for invalidating those
instruments.
The third question was whether, at the date of the mortgages of
11th October 1944, (a) Ethel Rose Gibbons was capable of understanding
effect of the deed which she executed, and (b) Olinda Gibbons was capable of
understanding the effect of the deed which she executed.
The fourth question
was whether, at the date of the transfer of 6th December 1945, (a) Ethel Rose
Gibbons was capable of understanding
the effect of the deed, and (b) Olinda
Gibbons was capable of understanding the effect of the deed. To each part of
the third and
fourth questions the answer returned by the jury was No. (at
5. These answers appeared to the learned Chief Justice to entitle the
plaintiff to declarations that the two indentures of mortgage
of 11th October
1944 and the memorandum of transfer of 6th December 1945 were nullities and of
no effect, and he ordered judgment
to be entered accordingly. The appeal to
the Full Court was based upon a number of grounds, but the court found it
unnecessary to
deal with more than one. Their Honours held that a disposition
of property made for valuable consideration by a person incapable
understanding its effect is not wholly void, but is voidable if, and only if,
the disponee knew or had reasonable grounds to know
of the disponor's lack of
understanding and did not act in good faith. They further held that the
transactions in question were for
valuable consideration; but as facts
sufficient to bring the case within the principle of law they had stated had
neither been alleged
in the statement of claim nor found by the jury, their
Honours gave the parties an opportunity to amend the pleadings, and expressed
their readiness to order a new trial if the amendments were made. The
appellant, however, declined to amend, and accordingly the
appeal was allowed
and the judgment given at the trial was discharged. (at p437)
6. In the course of the case here and below, the question was discussed
whether the jury's answers to the third and fourth questions
were sufficient
to establish such a degree of mental deficiency as the law considers relevant
to validity. The expression "the effect
of the deed", taken apart from
context, is ambiguous, and in order to know what the jury meant by its answers
it is necessary to
consider the summing-up of the presiding judge.
Unfortunately no official shorthand note was taken, and considerable
discrepancies
are found to exist amongst notes which were made by four of the
professional gentlemen in court. The learned Chief Justice was not
settle the points of difference until fourteen months after the trial, and
naturally he was unable to do more than correct
two or three misapprehensions.
The four versions of the summing-up attribute to his Honour a variety of
expressions describing what
it was that the sisters must have been capable of
understanding. The deed, the nature of the deed, the document, what they
what they were doing; all these forms of words are said to have been
used, together with more general statements, such as that the
question was
whether the sisters could not understand, or were of sound mind. It seems
reasonably clear, we think, that the expression
"the effect of the deed" as
used in the questions asked of the jury referred to the broad operation of the
deed, as distinguished
from its precise terms. (at p437)
7. The learned Chief Justice was clearly right in treating the validity of
the instruments in suit as depending upon the possession
by Ethel Rose Gibbons
and Olinda Gibbons of a degree of understanding relative to the nature of that
which they were doing. The law
does not prescribe any fixed standard of sanity
as requisite for the validity of all transactions. It requires, in relation to
particular matter or piece of business transacted, that each party shall
have such soundness of mind as to be capable of understanding
the general
nature of what he is doing by his participation. The case of Ball v. Mannin
[1829] EngR 165
; (1829) 1 Dow & Cl 380 (6 ER 568); 3 Bli
1 (4 ER 1241) though somewhat
confusedly reported, is an authority in point. The
House of Lords had before
it certain exceptions
to a charge delivered to a jury. The trial judge, after
saying that the question
to be tried was whether the person whose deed was
question was a person of unsound mind, added that to constitute such
unsoundness
of mind as should avoid a deed at law, the person
executing the
deed must be incapable of understanding and acting in the ordinary
life. As to this, Lord Tenterden, who
delivered the leading judgment, said:
"perhaps in that he went too far, but that
was a matter of which the plaintiff
in error was
not, under this bill of exceptions, entitled to complain" (1829)
1 Dow & Cl,
at p 391 (6 ER, at p 572) . Then he turned to the
appellant's
contention, that in order to avoid a deed the unsoundness of mind
of the party
executing it must amount to that
degree of unsoundness
which constitutes
idiocy, a test which, it was said, "implies
a total absence and deprivation of
the faculty
of reason in the party,
and is not a question of degrees, but of
the nature and quality
of the mind and faculty, directly at variance
language and
direction of the learned judge" (1829) 1 Dow & Cl, at pp
(6 ER, at p 570) . To this contention
their Lordships gave no countenance.
They approved a statement in the charge that as
one test of the requisite
capacity the jury
was at liberty to consider whether the
person concerned was
capable of understanding
what he did by executing the deed, when its
purport was explained to him. The
principle which the case supports, and for
which Boughton v. Knight (1873) LR 3 P &
D 64, at p 72 ; Jenkins v. Morris
(1880) 14 Ch
D 674 ; Birkin v. Wing (1890) 63 LT 80
and Estate of Park (1954)
P 112 may also be
cited, appears to us to be that the mental capacity
by the law in respect of
any instrument is relative to the particular
transaction which is being effected by means of the
instrument, and may be
as the capacity to understand the nature of
that transaction when it
is explained. As Hodson L.J.
remarked in the last-mentioned
case, "one cannot
consider soundness of mind
in the air, so to speak, but only in relation to
facts and the subject-matter of
the particular case" (1954) P 112, at p
. (at p438)
8. Ordinarily the nature of the transaction means in this connection the
broad operation, the "general purport" of the instrument;
but in some cases it
may mean the effect of a wider transaction which the instrument is a means of
carrying out: Manches v. Trimborn
(1946) 174 LT 344, at p 345 . In the present
case, it was necessary, we think, that the two sisters should have been
capable of understanding,
if the matter had been explained to them, that by
executing the mortgages and the memorandum of transfer they would be altering
character of their interests in the properties concerned, so that instead
of the last survivor of the three joint tenants becoming
entitled to the
whole, each of them would be entitled to a one-third share which would pass to
her estate if she still owned it at
her death. This is apparently not what the
learned Chief Justice put to the jury. It was the direct effect of the
instruments according
to their terms, and not the resultant severance of the
joint tenancy, that seems to have been referred to by the expression "the
effect of the deed", in the questions ultimately formulated. But a jury which
found the sisters incapable of understanding the direct
effect of the deeds
could hardly have found them capable of understanding the indirect effect of
the deeds in severing the joint
tenancy. We shall therefore consider the case
on the footing that the appellant has established that, at the respective
the mortgages and the memorandum of transfer, the sisters lacked that
capacity to understand which was necessary for the complete
validity of the
instruments. (at p439)
9. But proof of this was not enough to entitle the appellant to succeed in
the action if the result was that the instruments were
merely voidable; for an
instrument voidable by reason of the incapacity of a party, or by reason of
any form of imposition upon a
party, is valid unless and until it is avoided
by that party or his representatives. It is clearly not open to other persons,
as one claiming adversely to the party, to elect against the validity of
the instrument; and perhaps it was a realization of this
which led the
appellant to decline the opportunity she was given by the Full Court to amend
the pleadings and have a new trial of
the action. Neither Ethel Rose Gibbons
nor Olinda Gibbons purported in her lifetime to avoid the instruments severing
the joint tenancy,
and the respondent as their executor has always affirmed
their validity. Consequently the appellant must fail unless the law is that
deed disposing of property is absolutely void if at the time of its execution
the disponor was incapable of understanding what
he was doing, in the sense we
have mentioned. As to whether this is the law, there is a singular lack of
modern authority. The matter
was discussed in McLaughlin v. Daily Telegraph
Newspaper Co. Ltd.
[1904] HCA 51
; (1904) 1 CLR 243 , and the opinion was there expressed
deed executed by a lunatic is void, at least unless the lunacy
unknown to the person who procured the execution of
The deed there
in question, however, was a power of attorney, and
not one directly affecting
property. What was said in
the judgment,
therefore, went beyond the
necessities of the case. The present
appeal raises the problem in an acute
form. (at p439)
10. The law relating to persons who are lunatics so found must be put on one
side at the outset. Such a person is held incompetent
to dispose of his
property, not because of any lack of understanding (indeed he remains
incompetent even in a lucid interval), but
because the control, custody and
power of disposition of his property has passed to the Crown to the exclusion
of himself. Accordingly
his disposition is completely void: Re Walker (1905) 1
Ch 160 . For a similar reason, the conveyance of a person in respect of whom,
though he is not a lunatic so found, a receiver has been appointed under s.
116(1) (d) of the
Lunacy Act 1890
(Imp.) (53 and 54 Vict.
c. 5), has been held
to be void: Re Marshall (1920) 1 Ch 284 . (at p440)
11. The development of the law in relation to the validity of acts done by a
person of unsound mind not being a lunatic so found
was much affected in
earlier times by the currency of a doctrine (which grew up in the reign of
Edward III despite earlier authority
to the contrary: 2 Bla Comm 291), that no
man of full age should be heard to set up in the courts his own insanity. This
rule against
disabling his own person, or stultifying himself, as it was
variously called, applied to the party himself and to his privies in
(as reversioners or remaindermen) and in tenure (as by escheat), but it is
important to notice that it never applied to his
privies in blood (as heirs)
or his privies in representation (as executors or administrators): Beverley's
[1598] EngR 5
; (1603) 4 Co Rep 123b
(76 ER 1118) . The doctrine was whittled away and
finally abandoned. Its history is briefly recounted in the
"learned note" to
v. Gibson in the Jurist (1845) 9 Jur 140, at p 142 , to which Baron Parke
referred during the argument in
Molton v. Camroux
[1848] EngR 611
2 Ex 487 (154 ER 584)
: "This case, and the authorities referred to in it, shew how difficult it is
to eradicate a false
which has once become established in the law
of any country. It is expressly laid down by Littleton S. (405), that 'no
age shall be received in any plea, by the law, to disable his own
person', or, as Lord Coke expresses it, to stultify
himself (Beverley's
[1598] EngR 5
; (1603) 4 Co Rep 123b (76 ER 1118) ); and, as a corollary from this enlightened
proposition, no person was allowed to avoid any
act by shewing he did it
while he was non compos mentis or in a state of intoxication, or could avail
himself of the latter
purpose, civil or criminal. (Co. Litt. 247.b.).
It is, however, both just and important, to remark that a contrary opinion
maintained by Fitzherbert, in his Natura Brevium (202.d.), and the
more ancient authorities seem not to be uniform on
The doctrine of
Littleton and Coke, however, completely prevailed (Stroud v. Marshall
[1653] EngR 661
Cro Eliz 398 (78 ER 643)
; Cross v. Andrews (1598) 1d 622 ); and the ingenuity
of courts in modern times has been frequently
exercised in qualifying and
restricting
its mischievous operation, so that it is now almost, if not
entirely, at an end. (See Kent's
Commentaries, vol. 2, p. 451)" (1848)
at p 491 (154 ER, at p 585) . (at p441)
12. Even while the doctrine still flourished, the courts allowed an exception
from it in the case of a contract made by a lunatic
with a person who at the
time was aware of the lunatic's insanity: Imperial Loan Co. v. Stone, per Fry
L.J. (1892) 1 QB 599, at pp
601-602 . But it came to be held, not only that
proof of knowledge of the lunacy enabled the lunatic to avoid liability under
contract despite the rule against stultifying himself: Dane v. Viscountess
[1838] EngR 1033
; (1838) 8 C & P 679 (173 ER 670) , but also
without proof of that
knowledge (or at least proof of "the greatest reason to
believe" that the
lunacy existed) the lunacy was
sufficient to enable the contract to be
treated as invalid, even by the lunatic's
privies in representation to whom
pleading his insanity had never applied: Molton v. Camroux
[1848] EngR 611
; (1848) 2 Ex 487 (154 ER 584); (1849) 4 Ex 17 (154 ER 1107) . This
been taken, it was possible for Lopes L.J. in Imperial
Loan Co. v. Stone
(1892) 1 QB 599 to state the principle to be
from the cases in these
terms: "A contract made by a person
of unsound mind is not voidable at that
person's option if the
party to the contract believed at the time he
made the contract
that the person with whom he was dealing was of sound mind.
to avoid a fair contract on the ground of insanity, the mental
incapacity of the one must be known to the other of the contracting
defendant who seeks to avoid a contract on the ground
of his insanity, must
plead and prove, not merely his incapacity,
but also the plaintiff's knowledge
of that fact, and unless he
proves these two things he cannot succeed" (1892)
1 QB, at pp 602-603
. (at p441)
13. Once the law had become committed to this view, it could not be
maintained that problems concerning the contracts of persons
of unsound mind
could be solved by the simple formula: a contract requires the assent of both
parties; a person of unsound mind in
incapable of assenting; therefore no
contract can come into existence between parties of whom one is of unsound
mind. This appears
not to have been appreciated at first. Consider, for
instance, the case of Gore v. Gibson
[1845] EngR 387
; (1845) 13 M & W 623 (153 ER 260) .
action by an indorsee of a bill of exchange against the indorser, the
defendant pleaded
that at the time of making the indorsement
he was unable
(through intoxication) to comprehend the meaning, nature or effect of the
indorsement, and that the plaintiff then
had notice of this. The position was
put clearly by Baron Parke: "The averment in this plea
that the defendant
indorsed the bill,
means merely that he wrote his name upon it; then the plea
goes on to state, as matter of avoidance,
that the act of so writing his
is not obligatory on him, because he was in fact non compos mentis when he did
it" (1845) 13
M & W, at pp 626, 627 (153
at p 262) . Earlier he had said:
"But where the party, when he enters into the contract, is in
such a state of
drunkenness as
to know what he is doing, and particularly when it appears
that this was known to the other party,
the contract is void altogether,
he cannot be compelled to perform it". (As the context shows, void here meant
voidable: Matthews
v. Baxter (1873) LR 8 Exch 132
). Yet in this very case
Pollock C.B. (1845) 13 M & W, at p 626 (153 ER, at p 262) spoke of a
requiring the assent of
parties, giving that as the reason for saying
that when one of the parties was incapable of
assenting there could be no
Alderson B. said: "When it is shewn that the contract by
indorsement was made when
the defendant was in such a state of
drunkenness
that he did not know what he was doing, and especially when it appears that
plaintiff knew it, I cannot doubt that
the contract
is void altogether"
(1845) 13 M & W, at p 627 (153 ER, at p 262) . (Again,
void meant voidable, as
was to be pointed
out in Matthews
v. Baxter (1873) LR 8 Exch 132 ). Although
this acknowledged that a contract
was made by the indorsement, and that
some circumstances
the contract could not be avoided, the learned Baron added:
"It is just
the same as if the defendant had written
his name upon the
his sleep, in a state of somnambulism". In such a case, however,
the signature
would simply not be a signature
relation to the bill of exchange at
all. Though it would be on the same
piece of paper, it would not be an
indorsement
of the bill.
But a person who, having in truth indorsed the bill,
sets up his inability
to understand what he was doing, is necessarily
to avoid a contract made in fact. And so it was laid down in Matthews v.
Baxter (1873) LR 8 Exch 132 , the view of Parke
the mental incapacity
of one of the contracting parties is "matter of avoidance"
only, being thus
affirmed. (at p442)
14. This, of course, was not a new view. It had been "unanimously resolved"
to this effect by the King's Bench in Beverley's Case
[1598] EngR 5
; (1603) 4 Co Rep 123b (76
ER 1118) "upon argument, and on good consideration". The logical flaw in the
contrary theory was that it
erroneously assumed that a plea that the defendant
was unable to understand the nature of the document sued upon is equivalent
or involves, an allegation that he did not intend to sign it. In truth the
plea does not deny the defendant's execution of the document.
It assumes his
execution of it. It concedes that his mind, such as it was, went with his act.
What it asserts is that the state of
his mind was such that if the other
contracting party was aware of it he ought not to be allowed to insist upon
the contract. The
essence of the plea is, therefore, not that the contract was
not signed by the defendant, but that "a person who takes an obligation
another under such circumstances is guilty of actual fraud": per Parke B. in
Gore v. Gibson (1845) 13 M & W 623, at p 626
ER 260, at p 262) ; Bullen &
Leake, Precedents of Pleading, 3rd ed. (1868), p. 606, note (b). For this
reason, it is necessary
reject the suggestion made by Griffith C.J. in
McLaughlin v. Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co. Ltd. (1904) 1 CLR at pp 272-274 ,
the principle upon which a contract made with a lunatic by a person who
is aware of his insanity is held not to be binding upon the
fundamentally the same as the principle which renders void ab initio a
contract signed by a person who is fraudulently
induced by the other party to
believe that it is a contract of a different nature. The reason for holding a
contract of the latter
kind void is that the party imposed upon did not really
sign his name as a signature to any such contract as appears on the piece
paper. In that sense, "his mind did not go with his pen"; Carlisle &
Cumberland Banking Co. v. Bragg (1911) 1 KB, at p 496
v. Mackinnon
(1869) LR 4 CPD 704, at p 711 . "The deed is not his deed at all, because he
was neither minded nor intended
a document of that character or
class": National Provincial Bank v. Jackson (1886) 33 Ch D 1, at p 10 . No
doubt it would
to apply the same reasoning to a case in which a
lunatic wrote his name on a paper which in fact contained a contract,
in a frenzy, not even being aware what were the motions his hand was
performing. That would be a simple case of non est
factum, for
the truth would
be that the signature was not a signature to that document; it would be the
kind of case which Alderson
B. suggested
in Gore v. Gibson (1845) 13 M & W
623, at p 627
[1845] EngR 387
; (153 ER 260, at p 262) , when he spoke of a somnambulist writing
his name in his
sleep. But if the case made is only a case of incapacity
understand the nature of that to which admittedly the
signature was affixed,
no analogy exists with cases in which a seeming contract
is held to be
completely void for want of intention
that the signature shall
apply to any
contract of such a kind. Indeed, after
Molton v. Camroux
[1848] EngR 611
; (1848) 2 Exch 487
(154 ER 584); (1849)
4 Exch 17 (154 ER 1107)
, whatever doubt may have
persisted as to what must be proved in
addition to mental incapacity in order
avoid a contract, it was
the settled doctrine of English law that the
contract of a lunatic
was not void but was voidable only. Subsequent
have confirmed
this: Beavan v. McDonnell
[1854] EngR 101
; (1854) 9 Exch 309; 10 Exch 184 ;
Imperial Loan Co. v. Stone (1892) 1 QB 599 ; Tremills
v. Benton (1892)
607 ; Baldwyn v.
Smith (1900) 1 Ch 588 ; Bawlf Grain Co. v. Ross (1917) 55 Can
SCR 232 ; York Glass Co. v.
Jubb (1925) 134
LT 36 . (at p444)
15. This being the state of the law with respect to contracts, how can it be
otherwise with respect to conveyances? If the only
objection to a conveyance
is that the conveyor was incapable of understanding what he was doing by
executing it, there is no ground
for denying that it was in truth signed,
sealed and delivered by the conveyor as his deed. If it be said that the mind
of the conveyor
did not go with his acts, the answer applies with no less
force than it does in the case of a contract that that is not what is
established
by proof of a mere absence of capacity to understand the nature of
the document. We need not stay to consider whether, in order to
deed, it is necessary to prove, in addition to the conveyor's incapacity,
knowledge on the part of the conveyee that the
incapacity exists, or whether
other circumstances making the transaction less than fair to the conveyor will
suffice. (Even in regard
to contracts, the question whether unfairness
matters, if the party dealing with a person of unsound mind is ignorant of his
appears not yet to have been finally resolved: per Sargant L.J. in
York Glass Co. v. Jubb (1925) 134 LT, at p 43 ). The point to
be observed here
is that proof of a conveyor's incapacity to understand the nature of the
instrument is not proof that it is not
his deed, and it therefore provides no
logical ground for holding that the deed is void. Whether the authorities
nevertheless require
that conclusion to be accepted remains now to be
considered. (at p444)
16. In the decisions on the subject, the special case of a power of attorney
receives frequent mention. It is important to recognize,
however, the unique
character of a power of attorney as an instrument not affecting the title to
property or the rights or obligations
of persons, but merely conferring an
authority. The conception of a power of attorney voidable by reason of lack of
understanding
in the grantor would not be without its difficulty; it would
mean that an authority to bind the grantor would be retrospectively
defeasible, with the result that acts done in exercise of that authority would
be rendered void, not upon proof of such circumstances,
amounting to the
perpetration of a fraud by the other party to the act, as the grantor would
have had to establish if he had done
the act himself, but upon proof of
circumstances constituting a fraud by the donee of the power, whose guilt
might not be accompanied
by any unfairness at all on the part of the other
party. But whether or not this consideration has been at the back of it, the
is that from early times the power of attorney of a lunatic has been
regarded as void. (We use the word lunatic in this connection
as referring to
a person incapable of understanding the nature of the acts or transactions
which the particular power of attorney
purports to authorize). Decisions to
this effect have meant that the power of attorney is inefficacious as a source
of authority
to the donee to act on behalf of the lunatic. But so to hold is
merely to illustrate the general rule of law that a lunatic cannot
agent: Stead v. Thornton (1832) 3 B & Ad 357 (n)
[1832] EngR 355
; (110 ER 134) ; Tarbuck v.
Bispham (1836) 2 M & W 2, at p 8(150
at p 646) ; Elliot v. Ince (1857)
7 De GM & G 475,
[1857] EngR 392
; (44 ER 186, at p 190) ; cf. Drew v. Nunn (1879) 4
Toynbee (1910) 1 KB 215 . In order to reach this conclusion
there is no necessity to consider whether the power of attorney
lunatic's deed, for whether it is or not it cannot have any
operation to
create the relationship of principal and agent. That
a power of attorney
confers no authority on the donee was
the actual decision of this Court in
McLaughlin v. Daily Telegraph
[1904] HCA 51
; (1904) 1 CLR 243 , and the
actual decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Dexter
[1872] USSC 45
; (1873) 15 Wall 9
(21 Law Ed 73) ; and it was this proposition alone which the
Privy Council affirmed in Daily Telegraph Newspaper
Co. Ltd. v. McLaughlin
(1904) AC 776, at p 780 But, as we have said, in the reasons given for the
decision in McLaughlin's Case
[1904] HCA 51
; (1904) 1 CLR 243 in this
Court the general topic
of the void or voidable character of a deed executed by a lunatic
and the view was put forward
that every such deed is absolutely
void, at least unless it was procured innocently.
The Court's consideration
the matter was
much influenced by Dexter v. Hall
[1872] USSC 45
; (1873) 15 Wall 9 (21 Law Ed
73) , and to that case
it is necessary now to turn. (at p445)
17. The judgment, which was prepared by Strong J., begins with some
observations of a general character which are sufficiently met
by what has
been said already. These are followed by the remark: "It must be admitted,
however, that there are decisions which have
treated deeds and conveyances of
idiots and lunatics as merely voidable and not void"
[1872] USSC 45
; (1873) 15 Wall 9, at p 26
(21 Law Ed 73) .
Beverley's Case
[1598] EngR 5
; (1603) 4 Co Rep 123b (76 ER 1118) is referred
to as one such decision, and other cases, both English and American,
been mentioned. But there is one clear decision to the contrary, and
the judgment of Strong J. fastened upon it.
That is the case
of Thompson v.
Leach (1698) Carth 435; Comb 438, 468; 1 Ld Raym 313; 3 Mod 301; 12 Mod 174
(87 E.R. 199). . Lands
had been devised
to A for life, remainder to his sons
successively in tail, remainder to B in tail, remainder to the devisor's right
heirs. A, while
yet having no son, executed a surrender of his life estate to
B. A was non compos at the time. After the surrender
A had a son. If
surrender was merely voidable and therefore effectual unless and until
avoided, the particular estate which supported
the contingent
limited in favour of A's sons in tail became merged in B's remainder in tail.
The result of this would
have been that
the contingent remainders were
destroyed; for a mere right of action, such as the right to avoid the
surrender, would
be insufficient
to support a contingent remainder, and a
contingent remainder once extinct could not be revived. On the other hand,
the surrender
was completely void the contingent remainders were not
destroyed, and A's son became entitled in possession upon
A's death. The
Bench considered that the deed was void, and accordingly held that the
contingent remainder became an estate
vested in possession
at A's death. The
judgment was affirmed in Parliament "without much debate": Leach v. Thompson
[1698] EngR 30
; (1698) Show PC
150 (1 ER 102) . Sir Bartholomew Shower, who reported the case,
set out the arguments of counsel in some detail,
but as was his custom
no account of the reasons for the decision. Possibly the House acceded to the
final submission made
in argument, that "the
Word amens or demens imply that
the Man had no Mind, and consequently could make no conveyance". If so, the
case would seem to have
been treated as one of complete dementia in which it
was impossible that there should have been any real
execution of the deed,
than as one in which the deed was duly executed but by a person
incapable of understanding its effect.
It is enough to say, however,
there is no record of any principle of law laid down in the case by the House
of Lords it is
the judgment of the King's Bench
which has to be considered.
The numerous reports of the case vary a good deal in their accounts
judgment, but the reasoning
of the judges appears to be accurately stated in
the Modern Reports:
"The grants of infants, and of persons non compos, are parallel both in law
and reason; and there are express authorities that a
surrender made by an
infant is void; therefore this surrender of a person non compos is likewise
void" (1869) 3 Mod 301, at p 310
(87 ER 199, at p 204) . (at p447)
18. The proposition that an infant's surrender is void was, of course,
erroneous. In support of it the case of Lloyd v. Gregory
(1638) Cro Car 502
(79 ER 1032); W Jones 405
[1675] EngR 1048
; (82 ER 212) was cited; but in Zouch dem. Abbott v.
[1765] EngR 89
; (1765) 3 Burr 1794, at pp
[1765] EngR 89
; (97 ER 1103, at p 1110); 1 W Bl
575, at p. 578 (96 E.R. 332, at p. 333). , it was shown that Lloyd v. Gregory
Cro Car 502
(79 ER 1032); W Jones 405
[1675] EngR 1048
; (82 ER 212) decided no such
thing. The notion that by the common law an infant's conveyance
is void, was
finally exploded in Zouch
dem. Abbott v. Parsons
[1765] EngR 89
; (1765) 3 Burr 1794 (97 ER
1103) and, apart from statute, it has been
held ever since that infancy makes
a disposition merely voidable:
Lumsden's Case (1868) 4 Ch App 31 ; Martin v.
Gale (1876) 4 Ch
D 428 . It is remarkable that although, in Dexter v. Hall
[1872] USSC 45
; (1873) 15 Wall 9 (21 Law Ed 73) , Strong J. cited Zouch dem. Abbott v.
[1765] EngR 89
; (1765) 3 Burr 1794 (97 ER 1103) as laying it down "that deeds of an infant
which do not take effect by delivery of his hand
void", he did not advert
to the fact that this statement appears (1765) 3 Burr, at p 1804 (97 ER, at p
1109) as part of a quotation
from Perkins' Profitable Book, which goes on:
"but all gifts, grants or deeds made by infants, by matter in deed or in
writing, which
do take effect by delivery of his hand, are voidable, by
himself, by his heirs, and by those who have his estate". Nor did he refer
the observation which the judgment makes upon this: "The words which do take
effect are an essential part of the definition; and
exclude letters of
attorney, or deeds which delegate a mere power and convey no interest". It may
be added that in the next paragraph
of the judgment in Zouch's Case
[1765] EngR 89
Burr 1794 (97 ER 1103) there is a quotation from Brooke's Abridgment, which
includes the
sentence: "And besides, the delivery
of a deed can not be void;
but only voidable". (at p447)
19. The judgment in Thompson v. Leach (1698) Carth 435; Comb 438; 1 Ld Raym
313; 3 Mod 301; 12 Mod 174 (87 ER 199). proceeded,
therefore, upon a
misconception of the law in relation to deeds executed by infants. The case
did not deter Blackstone from writing
that "Idiots and persons of nonsane
memory, infants, and persons under duress, are not totally disabled either to
convey or purchase,
but sub modo only. For their conveyances and purchases are
voidable, but not actually void" 2 Bla. Comm. 291. . The case of Campbell
Hooper (1855) 24 LJ Ch 644 is a decision to this effect, for it was there
decided that foreclosure can be decreed in respect of
a mortgage given by a
lunatic. A case which was cited in Dexter v. Hall
[1872] USSC 45
; (1873) 15 Wall 9 (21 Law Ed
73) as having followed Thompson
v. Leach (1698) Carth 435; Comb 438; 1 Ld Raym
313; 3 Mod 301; 12 Mod
174 (87 ER 199). was relied upon only as having
decided that,
despite the supposed rule against stultifying oneself, under the
of pleading then in force a defendant was entitled to prove
insanity, as a ground for avoiding a deed, under the plea of non
est factum.
(The rules were later altered to require that a
defence of insanity be
specially pleaded: Harrison v. Richardson
[1835] EngR 910
; (1835) 1 M & Rob 504 (174 ER 174) ).
It was further said in
[1872] USSC 45
; (1873) 15 Wall 9 (21 Law Ed 73) that the
doctrine of Thompson v. Leach (1698) Carth 435; Comb 438; 1 Ld Raym 313;
Mod 174 (87 ER 199). was asserted also in Ball v. Mannin
[1829] EngR 165
; (1829) 1 Dow
& Cl 380 (6 ER 568); 3 Bli NS 1 (4 ER 1241)
. In that case,
however, no
consideration was given by the House of
Lords to the distinction between void
and voidable deeds. The
parties had agreed
below that the sole question to be
tried was whether
a certain deed was or was not "valid at law"; and the
given in the
House of Lords was confined by the bill of exceptions
certain limited objections to the trial judge's direction to
the jury as
what constituted "such unsoundness of mind as should
avoid a deed at law". (at
20. Except as a decision that a power of attorney is void if the donor was
incapable of understanding its effect when he gave it,
the case of Dexter v.
[1872] USSC 45
; (1873) 15 Wall 9 (21 Law Ed 73) cannot be regarded as a satisfactory
authority. It was largely responsible,
nevertheless, for the
views which were
expressed as to deeds generally in the judgment in McLaughlin v. Daily
Telegraph Newspaper
[1904] HCA 51
; (1904) 1 CLR 243 . Of the authorities referred to
in McLaughlin's Case
[1904] HCA 51
; (1904) 1 CLR 243
and not already discussed, there
only two to which particular reference need be made. One is Jenkins v. Morris
(1880) 14 Ch D
674 , as to which Griffith C.J.
said that in that case the
validity or invalidity of the deed was treated as being
dependent upon
mental condition of the person
by whom it was executed, and that no question
of knowledge or want of knowledge
of his condition
on the part of the other
raised. The answer was given by Fry L.J. during the argument in
Imperial Loan
Co. v. Stone, as
reported in the Law Journal (1892)
61 LJQB, at
p 450 , when he pointed out that it by no means follows from the
fact that the
issue which had been directed to
be tried in Jenkins v. Morris (1880) 14
Ch D 674 was whether the person concerned
was or was not
of sound mind, that
the finding
of the jury upon that issue determined the matter. The other case
was Howard v. Digby
[1834] EngR 135
; (1834) 2 Cl
& F 634 (6 ER 1293) , from which
Griffith C.J.
quoted two extracts from the speech of Lord Brougham. In neither
was the learned Lord Chancellor
concerned to distinguish between void
and voidable instruments. The case was one
in which the personal
representative of a deceased
lunatic wife was seeking to enforce against the
husband a liability for arrears
of pin-money, and the
question for decision
was whether
the husband could set off amounts he had expended in supplying his
wife during
her lifetime with
those things to which pin-money
was usually
applicable. The point the Lord Chancellor was making was simply that,
as he thought, was incapable
of binding himself consensually (and
presumably he meant binding himself conclusively),
yet he (and
representative) could become
liable for money or money's worth received. The
principle applied seems to be that which
of Appeal was later to
in In re Rhodes (1890) 44 Ch D 94 , namely that a lunatic's receipt of
goods or other benefits
to his position in life may
give rise to an
obligation, which is implied by law and to which the lunacy affords no answer,
for those necessaries (as they
are called) out of his own property.
This, indeed, had been laid down by the King's Bench eight
before Howard
[1834] EngR 135
2 Cl & F 634 (6 ER 1293) , against the opposition of Lord
Brougham himself when appearing as counsel
in Baxter v. Earl
of Portsmouth
[1826] EngR 754
; (1826) 5 B & C 170 (108 ER 63) . His lordship's language in Howard v. Digby
[1834] EngR 135
; (1834) 2 Cl &
F 634 (6 ER 1293) ought not to be read
as a pronouncement upon
the question which we have here to decide. (at
21. Upon the authorities as they now stand, it appears to us that we ought to
regard it as settled law that an instrument of conveyance
executed by a person
incapable of understanding its effect, in the sense of its general purport, is
not on that account void, though
in the circumstances it may be voidable by
the conveyor or his representatives. (at p449)
22. If consideration of the merits of the appeal had led to the opposite
conclusion, a serious question would have arisen by reason
of the fact, to
which the Chief Justice drew attention during the argument, that in earlier
proceedings in the same action orders
have been made declaring that the joint
tenancies subsisting between Olinda Gibbons, Ethel Gibbons and the appellant
were severed
by the indentures of mortgage executed on 11th October 1944 and
the memorandum of transfer executed on 6th December 1945. This came
the following manner. The statement of claim alleged incapacity on the part of
Olinda Gibbons and Ethel Rose Gibbons in
respect of the memorandum of transfer
but it did not do so in respect of the indentures of mortgage as the plaintiff
was then, apparently,
unaware that those instruments existed. They were set
up, however, by the defence, which contained a counterclaim for a declaration
that the joint tenancy in the whole of the land was severed by the three
instruments. At this stage, that is to say before reply,
the parties obtained
by consent an order for the determination of a point of law before the trial,
the point, as stated in the consent
order, being "whether by reason of the
acts deeds and instruments admitted or alleged in the defence (that is, the
indentures of
mortgage and the memorandum of transfer) the joint tenancy
subsisting between the plaintiff and Olinda Gibbons and Ethel Rose Gibbons
severed". The point of law came before Clark J., who made an order that the
joint tenancy subsisting in the
Real Property Act
land was not severed by the
memorandum of transfer, but that the joint tenancy subsisting in the land
under the general law was severed
by the indentures of mortgage. On appeal,
this Court discharged that part of the order which related to the
Property Act
and in lieu thereof made a declaration that the joint
tenancy in that land was severed by reason of the making and registration
the memorandum of transfer
[1949] HCA 3
; (1949) 78 CLR 313 . Subsequently, in 1951, the
plaintiff filed her reply, and therein alleged
first time a want of
capacity in Olinda Gibbons and Ethel Rose Gibbons in respect of the
indentures of mortgage. The
was then brought on for trial,
party appreciating, apparently, that the order of Clark J., as varied by the
Court, in terms concluded in favour
of the defendant the
ultimate question whether the joint tenancies were severed. It is
see how, in the present appeal,
the Court could have given a decision
inconsistent with its own previous order and with
of the Supreme
Court from which
no appeal had been brought. There was no accidental slip in
either order, for the intention
courts plainly was to answer
precise question which the parties had joined in submitting for decision. The
question was
not expressed
hypothetically, and
if it had been the courts might
well have declined to give an answer while the issues of fact remained
undetermined.
23. However, it has seemed desirable to consider the appeal on its merits.
For the reasons which have been stated the appellant's
claim in the action
cannot be sustained, and the appeal should be dismissed. (at p451)
Appeal dismissed with costs.
