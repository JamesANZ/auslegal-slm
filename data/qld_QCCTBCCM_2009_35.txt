REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
Application in this proceeding was filed on 26 February 2009. It seeks an
adjustment of the lot entitlements in the Contribution
Schedule for the
community titles scheme, “Pearl Sur Mer” Community Titles Scheme
31689 (“CTS”). The application
is made pursuant to
section 48(1)(b)
Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997
Act”), as facilitated by
Commercial and Consumer
Tribunal Act 2003
(“CCT Act”).
applicants are the owners, respectively, of Lots 33, 32, 31 and 28 in the
required by section 48(2) of the BCCM Act, the respondent is the Body Corporate
of the CTS. It filed its Defence on 23 April 2009.
Community Management Statement for the CTS shows that the relevant regulation
module is the “
Accommodation Module
”. Schedule
” to that Community Management Statement shows that both
the Contribution Schedule and the Interest Schedule have identical
entitlements for each separate lot, even though there are differences between
various lots. The total of the lot entitlements
for both the Contribution
Schedule and the Interest Schedule is 1,686.
Relevant legislation
47 of the BCCM Act, which by section 47(1) asserts that it states the general
principles for the application of lot entitlements
to a community titles scheme,
although having effect subject to the provisions of the BCCM Act providing more
specifically for the
application of lot entitlements, provides, in particular,
by section 47(2) that the contribution schedule lot entitlement for a lot
basis for calculating –
lot owner’s share of amounts levied by the body corporate, unless the
extent of the lot owner’s obligation to contribute
to a levy for a
particular purpose is specifically otherwise provided for in the BCCM Act (with
a relevant footnote stating that
the regulation module applying to a community
titles scheme might provide that a lot owner’s contribution to some or all
the insurance required to be put in place by the body corporate is to be
calculated on the basis of the lot’s interest schedule
lot entitlement);
value of the lot owner’s vote for voting on an ordinary resolution if a
poll is conducted for voting on the resolution.
47(4) of the BCCM Act states that neither the contribution schedule lot
entitlement nor the interest schedule lot entitlement
for a lot is to be for the
calculation of the liability of the owner or occupier of the lot for the supply
of utility service to
if the amount of the utility service
supplied to each lot is capable of separate measurement, and the owner or
occupier is billed
the combination of section 48(5) and section 48(6) of the
order of the Tribunal, where the order is about the contribution schedule, must
be consistent with the principle that the respective
lot entitlements
should be equal
” to the extent
to which it is “
just and equitable in the circumstances for them not to
deals with the criteria for deciding just and
equitable circumstances. Thus, although section 49(3) states that the matters
the Tribunal may have regard to are not limited to the matters stated in
section 49, section 49(4) states that the Tribunal may have
the community titles scheme is structured;
nature, features and characteristics of the lots included in the scheme;
purposes for which the lots are used.
section 49(5) of the BCCM Act the Tribunal may
have regard to any
knowledge or understanding the applicant had, or any lack of knowledge or
misunderstanding on the part of the
applicant, at the time the applicant entered
into a contract to buy the lot owned by the applicant, about –
lot entitlement for the subject lot or other lots included in the community
titles scheme;
purposes for which a lot entitlement is used.
section 48(10) of the
states that if the Tribunal orders an
adjustment of a lot entitlement schedule, the body corporate
”, as quickly as practicable, lodge a request to record
a new community management statement reflecting the adjustment ordered.
Legal principles
47, 48 and 49 of the BCCM Act were considered by the Queensland Court of Appeal
Fischer v Body Corporate for Centrepoint Community Titles Scheme 7779
[2004] QCA 214
[2004] 2 Qd R 638.
both the applicants and the respondent are clearly aware of the principles
because of the fact that the experts that they have
engaged have had specific reference to those principles, these Reasons will not
detail what
decided except to reiterate that what the
contribution lot entitlement schedule should do is to divide body corporate
expenses equally
except to the extent that the lots disproportionately give rise
to those expenses, or disproportionately consume services, with such
determination only being able to be made by reference to factors which have a
financial impact or consequence on the body corporate
and which cannot be
affected by factors which go to a lot’s value or amenity: at 645
Relevant dispute
applicants engaged Leary & Partners Pty Ltd (“L & P”) and
the respondent engaged Stewart Silver King &
Burns (“SSKB”) to
provide their respective experts’ Reports. It should be noted that
described such reports as, to a large extent, performing a
mechanical exercise of identifying the relevant costs, categorising them
then allocating them amongst the lot owners: at 641 [14]. This is not to
depreciate the value of those Reports but to put them
in the context that it is
the Tribunal in this case which decides how the applicable legal principles
apply to the facts and then
for the Tribunal to have recourse to the Reports, or
parts of them, to determine how the mechanical exercise is to be effected in
this proceeding.
original L & P Report was dated 24 February 2009. It is under the
authorship of Ms Kaylene Arkcoll. The initial SSKB Report
which was entitled
Preliminary Contribution Schedule Lot Entitlement Report
dated 31 March 2009. It is under the hand of Mr Martin Walsh.
order of the Tribunal made 7 July 2009, Ms Arkcoll and Mr Walsh were ordered to
consult with each other and prepare a document
that identified the areas where
they agreed and disagreed, stating the reasons for any such disagreement.
document which resulted from that consultation (“Joint Report”) is
under the letterhead of Leary & Partners Pty
Ltd, addressed to the Tribunal.
It is dated 21 July 2009.
general nature of the dispute between the experts is summed up in the Defence
filed by the respondent. In terms, it alleges that
the SSKB Report
” establishes the appropriate contribution schedule
which ought to be applied to the CTS, relying upon the contention that the
parking common area repair and maintenance costs ought to be apportioned to each
lot commensurate with the area of the exclusive
use areas allocated to the lot.
Necessarily,
the dispute between the experts is more far reaching, although ultimately of not
great significance in monetary terms,
than the Defence suggests.
Public utility charges and other water costs
of the areas of disagreement involves how annual water charges of $9,903.00, and
potential additional swimming pool water costs
for Lot 33, should be brought
into account.
the evidence presented to the Tribunal, the water charges made by the Gold Coast
City Council are made on the basis that the
amount of the utility service so
supplied to each lot is incapable of separate measurement and, therefore, the
owner or occupier
is not billed directly.
brings into play section 196 of the BCCM Act. By section 196(1) this provision
applies to a CTS such as here: if there is no
practicable way available to a
utility service provider to measure the extent to which the utility service is
supplied to each lot
in the scheme and, if the utility service is also supplied
to the common property, the common property; and if the supply of the
service to scheme land is charged according to usage, and is not charged for on
the basis of the unimproved value of the
such a case, being that which applies for this CTS, section 196(2) states that a
lot owner is liable to the utility service provider
for a share of the total
amount payable for the provision of the utility service to the scheme land and
section 196(3) states that
such a share is proportionate to the contribution
schedule lot entitlement for the lot.
Nevertheless,
before leaving that consideration, section 196(4) states that, however, the body
corporate may, by arrangement with
the utility service provider, take on the
liability for owners or occupiers of the lots for the utility service supplied
benefit of owners or occupiers. But, so far as the evidence goes for
this CTS, there has not been such an arrangement.
is appropriate to decide the effect of the water charges and costs before moving
on to a fuller consideration of other parts of
the dispute, such as it exists,
between the Reports of the two experts.
Mahon v Warringa Court BUP 372 CTS 14692
[2009] QCCTB CCM 18
Tribunal considered, for the relevant circumstances there, the effect of section
. But it should be understood that the facts in that
case showed that, except for one lot, all other lots were relevantly identical.
It was in those particular circumstances that the Tribunal decided that the best
approach on those facts, given that the facts presented
there were much more
detailed concerning the costs charged for the utility services as well, was that
the total costs ought to be
identified as an annual costing and, subsequent to
that, an analysis should be made of whether there should be equality of
contributions
for the Contribution Schedule or whether some other approach was
required by application of the relevant principles. In the end,
for all those
lots that were relevantly identical, they were each determined to have the same
contribution schedule lot entitlement
and the utility charge necessarily
followed (apart from that distinctly different lot).
Consequently,
the application of the relevant principles to that case depended on the
particular facts there.
it can be seen from the description of this CTS as it is erected on the scheme
land that there are identifiable differences
between lots and that, in general
terms at least, the Tribunal in this proceeding is dealing with a residential
tower complex that
contains some 33 lots and that that complex has both a
separate basement and a separate rooftop, together with a ground floor
a main foyer. Necessarily, the application of the principles here
must necessarily be different.
of the differences between individuals lots that the authors of both Reports
have identified (even if somewhat differently
for some aspects), the appropriate
way that the principles ought to be applied here is to take note of the final
effect that section
196(3) of the BCCM Act has (namely, that the share of each
lot owner is that share of the total amount payable for the provision
utility service that is proportionate to the contribution schedule lot
entitlement for the lot). This means that, in circumstances
where it is not at
all clear that the provision of water to each lot is self-evidentially
equivalent (or approximately so), the decision
as to how a commonly provided
utility service charge is allocated should follow what Parliament has decided is
the appropriate way
to approach the cost of such a service.
Consequently,
any water charge, in accordance with the proviso to section 47(2)(a) and in
accordance with section 196(3) of the BCCM
Act, will be allocated on the basis
of the lot entitlements for each lot as they appear in the Contribution
Schedule, as adjusted.
for the additional swimming pool water costs for Lot 33, as noted in the Joint
Report by L & P, the proposed charge of $56.00
is not large enough for
justice and equity to demand that it be allocated to Lot 33 in a way which would
make any difference to the
lot entitlements that will be decided by the Tribunal
to be appropriate. Necessarily, if, as a result of further changes to the
of water storage in south-east Queensland, the cost of water supplied to the
swimming pool that is solely for the use of Lot
33 dramatically increases, it
may mean that, in future, it might be appropriate to consider what would be the
best practicable way
for any significant increase in such costs to be allocated
the matter of the water charges and the additional swimming pool water costs can
be put to one side in any further consideration.
disagreement
the Joint Report, besides the matters just dealt with, there are six other Items
that were thought to be in contest. But for Items
1 and 2, SSKB have now agreed
with L & P on both those Items.
leaves Items 3, 4, 5 and 6. Since, for each and every one of these Items L
& P suggest that the costs should be shared equally
whereas SSKB suggest
that they should be proportionately shared as a percentage of exclusive use
space for car parking and storage,
and since there is a common justification
presented by each expert for this set of Items, it is sufficient for a single
to be made which will cover all four Items.
approach of L & P is that for replacing car park extraction fans, for
replacing/maintaining basement ducting for extraction
replacing/maintaining car park powder coated doors and for replacing motors and
controls on the automatic door for the
car park, the costings cannot be reliably
determined based upon an area for exclusive use storage and car spaces,
particularly when
the number of car spaces (or size of such) is no reliable
indicator of the extent of use per lot and where the areas of the storage
have no impact upon some of the costs discussed. Furthermore, at least with
respect to some of those Items, while the capacity
of the fans required is
related to the volume of the area in question, variations of the size being
considered have not been shown
to have had any appreciable impact on the final
choice of size or number. Lastly, one-third of the area in question is for
non-exclusive
common property
argument for SSKB is that its allocation is “
much fairer
The basis for that contention is not fully explained, relying simply upon an
assertion that SSKB are “
industry experts
” and have been
utilised to assist
” with the “
implementation of
Building Management Statements
” which often split costs of basements
between commercial volumetric lots and bodies corporate, and simply noting that
currently widely acceptable method (due to lower disputes) for
calculation
” is the one that is said to be “
”. It is not immediately obvious to the Tribunal that there is
any logical explanation, and therefore justification, for the
conclusion. If
anything, the fact that costs related to basements vary from scheme to scheme
and that, in certain schemes, there
are allocations of entire floors of
basements to one particular lot, only justifies different approaches being
applicable for different
sets of circumstances, with the latter set of
circumstances clearly requiring a different approach from that adopted here.
Consequently,
the Tribunal accepts that the explanation provided by L & P more fully
accords with the principles enunciated in
, particularly where
there is absolutely no evidence of any financial impact or consequence which is
shown to directly relate to the
actual size of the exclusive use car parking and
storage areas.
the Joint Report, L & P acknowledge that, following consultation with SSKB,
some amendments to allowances have been necessary
for four particular Items.
Those amendments have been made and the recommended new lot entitlements by L
& P are set out in
Table 5 to the Joint Report. As noted in the Joint
Report, the final cost allocations by both experts are very similar. There is
nothing else in the Joint Report that needs any further attention.
the recommended entitlements by SSKB are expressed in terms of three figures and
although it is possible to extract from
Table 5 of L & P a similar three
digit allocation, there seems no justifiable reason why it is necessary, other
than suggested
greater accuracy (which, in reality, is simply an appearance,
given all the assumptions and approximations that go into the calculations
such tables) and particularly where it is necessary, from time to time, to apply
the section 47(2)(b) reference when voting on
an ordinary resolution if a poll
is conducted for voting on that resolution.
the Tribunal determines that the lot entitlements that are set out in the
recommended lot entitlements in Table 5 (as amended
21 July 2009) of the Joint
Report are those which should be applied as the result of a proper adjustment of
the Contribution Schedule.
Tribunal will make an order which reflects the conclusion reached that the lot
entitlements that are recommended in Table 5 of
the Joint Report, suggested by L
& P, should be the method by which the Contribution Schedule for this CTS is
