Stirrings: Alternative Dispute Resolution In The Northern Territory
Alternative Dispute
Resolution in the Northern Territory
The Northern Territory Law Reform Committee is currently examining a
reference from the Attorney-General of the Northern Territory
on alternative
dispute resolution in Aboriginal communities. The Law Reform Committee's report
to the Attorney-General will detail
the following:
1. Dispute resolution options that are alternatives to existing legal mechanisms
and that would be practical and effective in Aboriginal
communities. Possible
options would include recognising elements of customary law, and introducing
practices which are currently
in existence informally in the Northern Territory
or which exist in other parts of Australia and overseas.
2. Advantages and disadvantages of the various options and any potential
obstacles to implementation.
3. An implementation plan for the recommended option-including any necessary
legislation.
