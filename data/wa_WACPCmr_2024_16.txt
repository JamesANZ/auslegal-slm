The landlord is responsible for demonstrating that the conditions are

When an application is received, the Commissioner is required
to, either:
approve the
landlord’s application; or
landlord’s application.
Reasons for Decision
a delegate of the Commissioner, I have reviewed all evidence. Only the evidence
relevant to deciding this application is mentioned
in these reasons for
When deciding whether to approve a condition, I am guided by
the following factors:
Is the proposed
condition appropriate, reasonable and proportionate to the risk?
Is the proposed
condition covered under any other law?
Do the parties
agree to the proposed condition?
proposed condition address any of the following factors in the RTA:
premises are unsuitable for keeping the pet;
the pet at the premises would exceed a reasonable number of pets being kept at
the premises;
the pet at the premises is likely to cause damage to the premises that could not
be repaired for less than the amount of the
security bond for the premises;
the pet at the premises would pose an unacceptable risk to the health and safety
of a person;
the pet at the premises is likely to cause the lessor undue hardship; or
prescribed ground.
Requested condition – the
requested pets are to be kept outside at all times
In written statements
to Consumer Protection, the landlord raised concerns that wooden and carpeted
flooring could be damaged by the
requested pets if they were left to roam freely
throughout the premises.
The tenant disputes the requested condition
because the requested pets are sensitive to heat and need to be kept in
temperatures between
16 and 24 degrees Celsius. The tenant advised that in
temperatures exceeding 24 degrees Celsius, the requested pets would be prone
heat stroke, or death. The tenant advised on days where the weather permits, the
requested pets will be kept outside in their
I have consulted
the RSPCA Knowledgebase, which contains an article titled “Where should I
keep my guinea pigs?”. This
article is available on the following website:
https://kb.rspca.org.au/knowledge-base/where-should-i-keep-my-guinea-pigs/.
The article states:
“Having a compact body, guinea pigs do not
cope well with heat, and they are susceptible to heat stress. Low temperatures
more comfortable for guinea pigs than high temperatures, especially if the
humidity is high. Guinea pigs are comfortable only in
the narrow temperature
range from 18° degrees Celsius to 23°degrees Celsius. They also prefer
a low relative humidity (below
This article and written
evidence from the tenant satisfies me that guinea pigs are prone to heat stress
if kept in temperatures above
24 degrees Celsius.
The tenant submits
that the requested pets are kept in an enclosure inside the premises, which is
sometimes kept outside if weather
permits. The requested pets are also handled
by the tenant’s child when out of the enclosure and not left to run free.
tenant supplied a photo of the enclosure on the wooden floorboards inside
the premises, with a waterproof mat and towels layered
underneath. The tenant
advised Consumer Protection that the mat is cleaned frequently.
regard to the evidence before me, I am not satisfied that the requested
condition is reasonable or appropriate, because it
exposes the requested pets to
a risk of serious health issues and discomfort. This condition is not approved.
Condition – the tenant must place a hard waterproof base with
sides under underneath the guinea pig enclosure, to protect the
I am not satisfied that the existing set-up adequately
protects the flooring from potential damage caused by the faeces and urine
the requested pets. It is likely that urine and faeces will seep through the
soft mats, and potentially stain the flooring,
cause a bad odour, or contribute
to rotting due to exposure to moisture.
I have decided to impose a
condition requiring the tenant to purchase a hard base to sit directly
underneath the enclosure. This hard
base should have sides to ensure that any
waste does not seep into the flooring to cause staining, odour, or damage.
This condition will protect the flooring from damage and ensure the
requested pets are not exposed to excessive heat with serious
repercussions.
A tenant or landlord who is dissatisfied with this
decision can appeal to the Magistrates Court of Western Australia. Appeals must
be lodged within seven days after receiving this decision, or a later date if
leave is granted by the Court.
The appeal can be started by lodging both
a Form 1B – Appeal Against Registrar’s Decision and a copy of this
notice with
the Magistrates Court online at
