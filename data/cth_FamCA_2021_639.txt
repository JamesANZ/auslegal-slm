that publication of this judgment by this
Court under the pseudonym
Lahiri & Saha
has been approved by the
Chief Justice pursuant to
s 121(9)(g)
Family Law Act 1975
REASONS FOR
1 In contested property settlement proceedings commenced by the husband in
July 2020, he not only joined the wife as a Respondent,
but also joined the
wife’s Trustee in Bankruptcy.
2 The wife was the subject of a sequestration order made by a Judge of the
Federal Circuit Court of Australia on 30 September 2016.
For reasons not
necessary to detail in these Reasons, the wife’s bankruptcy did not end by
effluxion of time, but has been
extended. She remains at this time, an
undischarged bankrupt.
3 The affidavit of the Trustee, Mr Feltos, filed 18 May 2021, provides full
details of a history of the proceedings in the Federal
Circuit Court of
Australia, Federal Court of Australia and High Court of Australia since the
sequestration order was made on 30 September
4 A critical issue in the marital property dispute (but by no means the only
issue) is the effect of two transactions relating to
a property located at B
Street, Suburb C, New South Wales (“the Suburb C
property”), namely:
(a) On 15 October 2014, the wife transferred a
interest in the Suburb C property to the husband, which was
registered on 3 December 2014; and
(b) On 8 December 2014, after a discharge of mortgage had been registered over
the Suburb C property, the title was unencumbered.
On the same day, the wife
transferred her remaining 99/100
in the Suburb C property to D Pty
Ltd as Trustee of the D Pty Ltd Superannuation Fund.
5 Simply stated, if the transfer of the wife’s interest in the Suburb C
property (noting that on 8 December 2014, the husband
transferred his
interest in the property to the D Pty Ltd Superannuation
Fund), did not form part of the bankrupt estate at sequestration, then it
represents an interest amenable to a splitting order under the
Family Law Act
(Cth) (“the Act”).
6 The Trustee, in the notice issued pursuant to
(Cth) (“the
Bankruptcy Act
”) dated 4 June 2020,
claims that the transfers are void pursuant to
Bankruptcy Act
, and as a result, the D Pty Ltd Superannuation Fund is indebted
to the bankrupt estate to the value of $853,875.
7 Both the husband and the wife oppose the relief sought and as a result,
orders made on 2 June 2021 which ordered a discrete hearing
of only this aforementioned bankruptcy issue, is listed for hearing for two days
commencing 16 September 2021.
8 On 24 March 2021, the wife filed a Response to an Application in a Case
seeking, for the first time, to significantly expand the
relief and orders
sought under the
Bankruptcy Act
. As earlier noted, the wife is no stranger to
the bankruptcy jurisdiction, and although she does not have the benefit of legal
representation,
she is both extremely articulate and literate as transcripts of
interlocutory hearings will attest and her written submissions demonstrate.
9 Both parties are now unrepresented and although orders pursuant to s 102NA
of the Act have been made, representation under the cross-examination
will be available for the property proceedings, but do not extend to the relief
sought under the
Bankruptcy Act
10 On 24 March 2021, the wife filed a Response to an Application in a Case
which I regarded as a Cross-Application for relief. The
orders sought are
articulated as follows:

proceedings pursuant to
section 79(1)
Family Law Act

11 It is regrettably a feature of these proceedings that the unrepresented
wife often leaves the filing of applications or written
submissions until the
last moment, as with the said Response and Cross-Application, which was filed
the day before a scheduled Case
Management Hearing (“CMH”) on 25
March 2021.
12 On 25 March 2021, the Trustee for Bankruptcy made an oral application to
strike out most of the wife’s Response, however
the late filing of the
Response required that oral application to be adjourned, so that the Court could
consider how to proceed with
the discrete bankruptcy issues in the midst of the
substantive proceedings that were listed for trial in October 2021. Ultimately,
those trial dates have been vacated as a result of the listing for a discrete
hearing relating to the bankruptcy dispute.
13 On 7 April 2021 and again on 10 May 2021, further CMH’s were
conducted and made more difficult by the need for them to be
electronic means, and where the wife informed the Court she was engaged in other
litigation which was occupying her available
time. Nonetheless, the following
further submissions have been filed and considered in respect of the strike out
application, namely:
(a) the Trustee’s Written Submissions filed 20 May
(b) the Trustee’s affidavit filed 18 May 2021;
(c) the wife’s Written Submissions filed 11 June 2021;
(d) the husband’s affidavit filed 7 July 2021; and
(e) the Trustee’s Written Submissions in Response filed 14 June
14 Although the husband’s affidavit gives evidence about the alleged
solvency of the wife at 30 September 2016 and asserts,
abuse of power by the Official Receiver’s delegate, for the purpose of the
strike out application, the husband at paragraph
4 of his affidavit filed
7 July 2021, states that he “supports in full” the
wife’s written submissions filed 11
DISCUSSION:
15 On the material relied upon, I find as
(a) Leave was given by the Court for the Second
Respondent Trustee to make an oral application. To the extent the wife says r
Family Law Rules 2004
(Cth) (“the Rules”) requires
a formal, written Application in a Case, in the circumstances of this case
– proceeding
with the oral application and considering same by written
submissions, reflected the power under r 1.12 of the Rules, where the Court
its own initiative, may dispense with the need for a formal, written Application
in a Case. This was appropriate considering the
main purpose of the Rules is to
ensure the case is resolved in a just and timely manner (r 1.04 of the Rules)
and the consideration
of the administration of justice, which includes that the
wife’s bankrupt estate is administered appropriately and according
(b) In circumstances where the Trustee has provided an undertaking on 7 August
2020 to this Court, from dealing with or selling the
Suburb C property, or
enforce any change over the property created under
, the injunction sought at Order 2 of the wife’s Response to an
Application in a Case is unnecessary;
(c) The Trustee’s submissions at paragraphs 5 to 11, detail how Orders 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 sought by the wife have been
determined previously by the
Federal Circuit Court of Australia. The submissions identified the judgments
delivered by his Honour
Judge Manousaridis ([2018] FCCA 1738;
[2018] FCCA
[2020] FCCA 2125)
on these issues. In response to the Trustee’s
submission, the wife says:
The second respondent continues to mislead the Court by falsely alleging the
orders I seek against him have already been determined
by the Federal Circuit
Court. They have not, as I have repeatedly stated, all of my applications were
dismissed ex parte with only
me present, without any hearing and without any
determination of the issues at a “leave only”, interlocutory
(d) I am satisfied the Federal Circuit Court of Australia has determined the
issues raised again in this Court at Orders sought 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. It is
appropriate to note that the Federal Circuit Court of Australia has exercised
its jurisdiction under the
Bankruptcy Act
, and where decisions have been made in
the past against applications made by the wife, she had appeal rights available.
no evidence that when she chose to appeal, that she has been
successful. The reasons set out at [12] to [15] in
(supra), whereby
the wife required leave before filing further applications, provided as
12. I will say something very briefly about the affidavit referred to in that
email. Various allegations are made in it. These are
that fraudulent evidence
was presented before me at the time I made the sequestration order and
fraudulent evidence was provided
before Farrell J on the hearing of the appeal.
It also contains assertions in relation to the conduct of the trustee in
of Ms Saha’s estate. This includes allegations of providing
false sworn evidence, illegally obtaining a garnishee order, the
making of false
and malicious complaints to the inspector general to seek fraudulent criminal
charges against Ms Saha, repeated refusal
to settle, collusion with creditors,
and the failure to provide any evidence of provable debts. The mere statement of
what is asserted
in the affidavit should reveal why I formed concerns about
whether Ms Saha should be permitted to proceed on the application based
allegations.
13. At the hearing before me today Mr Carter, who appears on behalf of Ms Saha,
made some submissions. After an exchange between
me and Mr Carter, I adjourned
the matter to permit Mr Carter to obtain further instructions from Ms Saha. When
I came back on the
bench, Mr Carter informed me that he had instructions that Ms
Saha did not wish to move on the application as it was currently formulated
on the affidavit on which she intended to rely.
14. In those circumstances, I indicated to Mr Carter that what has so far
occurred should be formalised in some sort of way, and
that the manner in which
I believe the matter should be formalised is by me making an order granting Ms
Saha leave to file the application
returnable instanter and for me to dismiss it
and also to make an order that Ms Saha is to file no further application in this
without first obtaining the leave of the Court which in practical
matters means my leave being the judge to whom this matter has
been docketed.
15. In my view, this is a fair way of dealing with the matter. Ms Saha will not
be deprived of any reasonable cause of action she
may have; and also as
importantly other parties will not be troubled by having to deal with an
application which may have no reasonable
prospects of success or worse, be an
abuse of process. In those circumstances, therefore, I propose to make the
orders I have indicated
I would make.
The wife did not appeal the orders made 3 April 2018;
(e) It is simply an abuse of power to try again to bring those same proceedings
to the Family Court of Australia for determination;
(f) Order 11 seeks funds received by the bankrupt estate from a sale of the
Bankrupt’s half share in the property located at
R Street, Suburb S, New
South Wales (“the Suburb S property”) be paid to the
wife’s Superannuation Fund “as
well as compensation for under sale
of the property to a related party.” Although I accept the wife raises
many complaints
interest in the Suburb S property vested in the Trustee pursuant to
Bankruptcy Act
. As I will refer to later in these reasons, the Family Court of
Australia has not assumed jurisdiction in every bankruptcy issue
between the
wife (and for that matter, also the husband) and the Trustee. The issue for
discrete determination has been identified
and directly impacts on the
obligation of this Court to make orders under the
Family Law Act
, between the husband and wife.
(g) Orders 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 are the subject of submissions by the Trustee
at paragraphs [16] to [26] and clearly relate to
complaints by the wife (and
apparently supported by the husband) about the administration of the bankrupt
estate. This Court has
not accepted jurisdiction under the
Bankruptcy Act
determine every dispute between the wife and the Trustee. If she has remedies
against the Trustee, she may elect to pursue them
elsewhere. This Court is
seized of a discrete dispute, already identified and ready for hearing;
(h) To the extent that the wife seeks to canvas these issues in this Court, when
by a deep sense of
frustration or unfairness, encapsulated by her submissions at [21]:
21. The forced bankruptcy of a clearly solvent person, keeping her bankrupt by
false statements to Court, and extension of her bankruptcy
period by another 5
years with intent to keep her bankrupt indefinitely as the trustee has conveyed
to Mr Lahiri, for the wrongful
motive and collateral purpose of serial theft of
her multiple unencumbered properties, while he has deprived her of all access to
any funds at all and left her no money to live on, fits the definition of
“abuse of process” as in “Ashby”
in [19] above
(i) The wife’s concerns about fees charged by the Trustee (and his conduct
generally) are succinctly set out at [27] as follows:
27. The trustee’s brief assertions in his submissions of 20 May 2021 are
deliberately false, and do not answer or address the
evidence in my previous
affidavits served on him, in particular that my entire share of the property at
R Street Suburb S was secured
against a mortgage to my parents. Disputed
evidence is a matter to be heard at trial, and not summarily dismissed without a
The Court has already fixed a two day trial on 16 and 17 September, and
no prejudice has been shown by the trustee in waiting until
the hearing, in
circumstances where he has already paid himself, the petitioning creditor who
appointed him and their same (common)
lawyer nearly $ 550 000.00 from his trust
account (Annexure “M”, page 163 of trustee’s affidavit of 18
lists $192 630 35.00 paid to himself, the trustee, $175 612.15 paid to
the petitioning creditor, and $110 883.87 paid to their common
lawyer in fine
print without dates paid or names paid to) without any assessed costs, and
without signed consent of the other creditors,
myself or Mr Lahiri while there
were orders pending against him to pay back those funds wrongfully seized by
him. The prejudice is
to me, in being forced into bankruptcy and being left
derelict, with NO access to funds
Just because the Family Court of Australia is a Court, does not mean, as
presumably oral submissions by the wife suggest, it should
determine these
issues when other Courts have, she says, not done so to her satisfaction. Forum
shopping is not appropriate.
(j) In the Trustee’s submissions in Response, at paragraphs [23] to [26]
23. Ms Saha’s position seems to be that because a final contested hearing
did not occur in the Federal Circuit Court, her applications
determined. This is obviously wrong, and ignores the inconvenient truth that the
reason why final contested hearings did
not occur is because the Federal Circuit
Court, on three separate occasions, determined that her applications could not
final contested hearings because they:
(a) had no reasonable prospects of success;
(b) were bound to be summarily dismissed if they were allowed to proceed;
(c) would be an abuse of process of the Court.
24. The bulk of Ms Saha’s submissions are accordingly misconceived. They
cite largely irrelevant authorities and rules, and
are misdirected at satisfying
irrelevant legal tests. For example:
(a) it is not true, as asserted by Ms Saha at [5] of her submissions, that
Federal Circuit Court case SYG 235/2015 was ‘closed’
in the Federal
Circuit Court to allow this Court to determine the issues raised in her
Response. Annexed and marked “
” is a copy of an email dated
7 August 2020 from the Registry which confirms that Federal Circuit Court case
SYG 235/2015 was
closed because it was finalised on 4 August 2020 with judgment
being delivered by Judge Manousaridis. It is a gross misrepresentation
that an administrative act by the court has the legal effect contended by Ms
(b) there is no relevant error, or relevant judgment, identified in [9] of the
submissions;
(c) Ms Saha’s incorrectly attributes her bankruptcy to the Trustee at
[21], as opposed to the petitioning creditor;
(d) the Trustee is not required to establish any abuse of process (as contended
at [22] of the submissions) to succeed on the present
application; and
(e) there is incontrovertible evidence (in the Trustees affidavit affirmed 18
May 2021) that the property at R Street, Suburb S was
sold pursuant to orders of
the Supreme Court of NSW, contrary to [24] of the submissions.
25. Ms Saha refers at [27] to evidence in unidentified affidavits being relevant
to this application. Ms Saha failed to identify
any evidence in any affidavit
that supports her submissions. The Trustee notes that Ms Saha was required to
serve any further evidence
on which she relied in respect of this application by
order 3 of the orders made by this Court on 10 May 2021.
26. Ms Saha incorrectly states at [27] of her submissions that the
Trustee’s fees were paid without consent of the creditors
of her bankrupt
estate. The Trustee’s fees have been approved by creditors.
I agree with the force of those submissions.
(k) Order 19 seeks an order that:
19. Order that the applicant and 2
respondent pay funds seized from
superannuation fund accounts and sale of superannuation fund assets to the
superannuation fund,
at replacement value with interest and Company and trust
accounts back to those accounts and that these funds are not to be seized
There is no evidence that the Trustee has “seized” funds from the
wife’s Superannuation Fund. It may be that the
wife complains (as Order 19
suggests) that the husband has seized funds, but that issue can be sensibly
ventilated during the future
proceedings under
Family Law Act
. As against the Trustee, that relief is doomed to fail.
(l) A similar complaint is articulated within Order 41, namely that the Trustee
“be ordered to account to me for any funds
or assets of my superannuation
fund received by him within 2 days of the order.” To the extent this
relates to the administration
of her bankrupt estate, I rely upon the finding
made earlier in these Reasons. It does seem clear, to some degree, that the wife
is not entirely certain who her target for recovery should be, because she seeks
relief against the husband “to account to
me for any funds or assets of my
Superannuation Fund received by him...since 5 November 2000”
(Order 40).
16 The interests of justice and the need for the
dispute between the husband and wife under the
Family Law Act
to be dealt with
efficiently and in a timely way, is facilitated by the discrete hearing listed
to proceed, proceedings on the issues
already identified.
17 I will Order, for the Reasons given, that the Application for orders set
out at 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
19, 33, 34, 35, 41 and
52 of the Response to an Application in a Case filed 24 March 2021 be struck out
or otherwise dismissed.
18 It is the Court’s intention to proceed with the discrete hearing set
to commence on 16 September 2021.
19 After the issues at that discrete hearing are determined, the substantive
property proceedings between the Applicant husband and
Respondent wife, will be
able to be determined. Hopefully, the discrete hearing will achieve the
intention of further narrowing the
issues in dispute, clarifying the legal and
equitable property interests and liabilities of the parties.
20 As earlier noted, the effect of the application of
of the Act,
will be that for the substantive proceedings, each party will have the
opportunity to retain a publically funded legal
practitioner.
21 Considering the other relief sought by the wife in her Response to an
Application in a Case (for example at Order 3, she seeks
to join the
parties’ 16 year old autistic son in the proceedings), it is my view that
resources are best utilised by the Court
if those remaining matters are
adjourned to a date to be fixed, after the discrete hearing determines those
issues, at which future
date the parties’ lawyers can address the Court on
proposed orders 3, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 36,
38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 and 53.
I certify that the preceding twenty-one (21)
numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment of the
Honourable Justice
