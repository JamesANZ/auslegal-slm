REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
application in this proceeding, filed 2 July 2009, seeks an adjustment of the
lot entitlements in the Contribution Schedule to
the community titles scheme
known as “Paloma” Community Titles Scheme 9524 (“CTS”).
The applicant is the
owner of Lot 11 in the CTS.
application is brought pursuant to
section 48(1)(b)
Body Corporate and
Community Management Act 1997
(“the BCCM Act”), as facilitated
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act 2003
(“the CCT Act”).
respondent, as required by section 48(2) of the BBCM Act, is the Body Corporate
of the CTS. It filed its defence on 17 September
both parties have consented to a decision being made in this proceeding, on the
documents filed and without the parties appearing,
the Tribunal has decided to
make an adjustment to the lot entitlements in the Contribution Schedule in
accordance with the Leary
& Partners Pty Ltd’s Report dated 1 July
2009, as amended by a clarifying Addendum of 23 July 2009 (“Amended L
P Report”).
Legislation
the method of decision-making, section 48 of the CCT Act states that the
Tribunal may decide all of a proceeding from a
consideration of the documents
filed, without the parties or witnesses appearing, if the parties to the
proceeding agree: see paragraph
(a). It is described, in a non-technical way,
as a decision
“on the papers”.
This has happened here.
for an adjustment to the Contribution Schedule, it is primarily to sections 48
and 49 of the BCCM Act that resort must be had.
section 48(5) of the BCCM Act states that the order of the Tribunal must be
consistent with, if the orders are about the Contribution
Schedule, the
principle stated in section 48(6). In turn, section 48(6) states that, for the
contribution schedule, the respective
lot entitlements should be equal, except
to the extent to which it is just and equitable in the circumstances for them
49 of the BCCM Act then states the criteria for deciding just and equitable
circumstances. Although section 49(3) states
that the matters that the Tribunal
may have regard to for deciding a matter such as this are not limited to the
matters stated in
section 49, sections 49(4) and 49(5) state what the Tribunal
may, and may not, have regard to. Section 49(4) states that regard
(a) how the community titles scheme is structured;
(b) the nature, features and characteristics of the lots included in the
scheme; and
(c) the purposes for which the lots are used.
49(5) of the BCCM Act states that the Tribunal may not have regard to any
knowledge or understanding the applicant had, or
any lack of knowledge or
misunderstanding on the part of the applicant, at the time the applicant entered
into a contract to buy
the lot owned by the applicant, about –
(a) the lot entitlement for the subject lot or other lots included
in the community titles scheme; and
(b) the purpose for which a lot entitlement is used.
is also important in a case such as this that section 48(10) of the BCCM Act
states that, if the Tribunal orders an adjustment
of a lot entitlement schedule,
the body corporate
, as quickly as practicable, lodge a request to
record a new community management statement reflecting the adjustment

Fischer v Body Corporate for Centrepoint Community Titles

[2004] 2 Qd R 638
considered not only sections 48 and 49, but
also section 47, of the BCCM Act.
J, with whom McPherson JA and Atkinson J expressly concurred, stated the
following applicable principles and the following
approaches to an adjustment
such as this:
the precise
mechanism by which the body corporate experts called by both parties in that
case examined the expenditure of the relevant
body corporate, categorised that
expenditure in accordance with a “quoted description” and produced a
table which showed
what percentage of the total costs should be allocated to
each category, thereby arriving at a table of appropriate lot entitlements
each lot, “was not explained and was not necessary”: at 642
these expert
witnesses, while knowledgeable about the types of costs incurred by building
owners and bodies corporate in maintaining
and providing services to those who
inhabit the building and the means by which those costs might be allocated
between lot owners,
to a large extent performed a mechanical exercise of
identifying the relevant costs, of categorising them and then allocating them
among the lot owners: at 641 [14];
the preferable
view of the BCCM Act is that a contribution schedule should provide for equal
contributions by lot owners, except insofar
as some apartments can be
“shown” to give rise to “particular” costs to the body
corporate which other lots
do not, and the question whether a schedule should be
adjusted is to be answered with regard to the demand made on the services and
the amenities provided by a body corporate to the respective lots, or their
contribution to the costs incurred by the body corporate:
at 644 [26];
more general
considerations of “amenity, value or history” are to be
“disregarded”, because what is at issue
“equitable” distribution of the costs: at 644 [26];
Example 3 of the
Explanatory Notes which accompany the 2003 Amending Act explained the change to
the legislation, at least with respect
to a basic scheme, by noting that if all
lots are residential lots “ranging in size from a small lot to a
penthouse”,
the contribution schedule lot entitlements “generally
would be equal” and that, even if the contribution schedule may
different because of private swimming pools or private lifts, the other lots in
the scheme “despite being of different size
or aspect would be expected to
contribution schedule lot entitlements” (emphasis
added): at 644-645 [28];
the BCCM Act is
intended to produce a contribution lot entitlement schedule which divides body
corporate expenses “equally”
except to the extent that the lots
“disproportionately” give rise to those expenses, or
“disproportionately”
consume services: at 645 [30];
the starting
point for the entitlements in the contribution schedule is that they should be
“equal”, with a departure
from that principle being allowable only
where it is just, or fair, to recognise inequality: at 645 [31];
if the inquiry
concerning adjustment is limited to the extent to which a lot creates costs, or
consumes services, above or below the
average, one can “readily
determine” what the contribution lot entitlement should be – but if
the inquiry be wider
and include such nebulous criteria as the structure of the
scheme, or the nature, features and characteristics of the lots in the
and the purposes for which they are used, there is no intelligible basis on
which a vast variety of circumstances might be
relied upon to depart from, and
therefore erode, the principles said to be paramount, namely, that there should
be an equality of
entitlements: at 645 [32]; and
section 49, and
in particular section 49(4), of the BCCM Act should be construed as meaning that
those identified matters to which
a court may have regard are to be regarded
only to the extent, if any, that they affect the costs of operating a community
scheme: at 646 [33].
application sought, as alternatives, either that the contribution entitlements
be fixed as equal or that they be fixed in accordance
with the recommended
entitlements in the Amended L & P Report. Attached to the application was
the original of that Report.
defence contained an attached letter from Body Corporate Services to the
Tribunal which stated that the body corporate advised
that it neither supported
nor opposed the application. Even so, there was attached a copy of the minutes
of the AGM of 11 September
2009 in which Motion 10 to review the Contribution
Schedule, otherwise requiring a resolution without dissent to be effective, was
lost by the vote of 1 dissenting owner. Lastly, the defence further attached
what was stated to be an “independent”
review of the Amended L &
P Report. By reason of
, what happened at the AGM is irrelevant,
it being for this Tribunal to apply the law in accordance with the statutory
Consideration of Amended L & P Report
initially with the original L & P Report dated 1 July 2009, it has, as
freely acknowledged by the author of the “independent”
Willis, on the whole been prepared “accurately in accordance with the
current decisions from the CCT and a fair
and reasonable schedule of
Contribution Lot Entitlement produced”.
particular, the Report has fully described the improvements on the CTS land, the
items in the Administrative Fund and the Sinking
Fund, and the budgets
concerning them, and set out a complete statement of the methodology that is
consistent with those required
those conclusions, it is unnecessary where the respondent has produced such an
“independent” review to conclude
other than the suggested adjustment
of the lot entitlements in the Contribution Schedule, as amended by Addendum of
23 July 2009,
should be accepted, subject to there being any valid criticism
raised by Mr Willis.
reason why the Addendum of July 2009 was needed was that certain quantity
surveying measurements were redone by Ms Arkcoll from
architectural plans
supplied to her on 20 July 2009, insofar as the measurements concerned the areas
of lot balustrades, painting
and body corporate maintained glazing. As a result
of site measurements, and photographs, done, and taken, the Addendum identified
a number of instances where the plans did not match the final construction. In
such instances, what were used were the “as
constructed” quantities.
This led to some minor but still significant changes which resulted in a new
Consideration of the “review” of Mr Willis
criticism by Mr Willis concerning the allocation of the cost of Item 11 in Table
3 in the Amended L & P Report in respect
of the “true” lengths
of the balustrades is shown, by reference to the Amended Table 4, to be without
foundation for
Lots 9, 10, 11 and 12, to have some slight difference for Lots 6,
7 and 8 and to have quite a marked difference for Lot 5. Given
that Ms Arkcoll
is, as appears from her CV, a Bachelor of Applied Science (Quantity Surveying)
and an Associate of the Australian
Institute of Quantity Surveyors, and given
that there is nothing objectively to establish that the measurements which Mr
Willis champions
are necessarily more accurate than those of Ms Arkcoll, and
given the approach by the respondent Body Corporate not to put in factual
contention Ms Arkcoll’s measurements, the Tribunal has little hesitation
in accepting the figures that appear in the Amended
Table 4. In any event, the
review by Mr Willis concedes that such differences would not alter the result
for the lot entitlements
in the Contribution Schedule, except perhaps for Lot 5.
But even with respect to that, given that if Ms Arkcoll’s figures were
be wrong, the error would only change the “Total Cost” in Table 4
for Lot 5 in a marginal way, it is unlikely to have
any significant effect, even
for that lot.
the patio areas behind Lots 1 to 4 (inclusive), the recommendation that the Body
Corporate amend the Community Management
Statement is no reason to change in any
way the recommended entitlements in the Amended L & P Report. That is,
regardless of
whether they are exclusive use areas, it is only those Lots which
generate the costs for those tiles. Thus, even if there were to
be an amendment
to the Community Management Statement to make them exclusive use areas, it would
not change at all the fact that
there would be costs and that such costs would
be borne by those Lots only, although those costs could then be removed from the
Fund, with consequential effect on the levies.
Considering
the future rendering of the exterior façade, since the Tribunal can only
deal with what exists at the time the
proceeding is determined before it, if
there were to be such a change, it would, perhaps, necessitate a change to the
Contribution
Schedule – but nothing can possibly be done by the Tribunal
ongoing argument about the potential use of body corporate facilities and
amenities by occupants being notionally determined on
the basis of the number of
bedrooms is a continuing source of difficulty for parties. The problem with
determining some kind of
“user pays” allocation which depends upon
“variations to occupancy capacity” is that it relies upon inherently
uncertain, and certainly intuitive, methods that require an accurate prediction
to be made of “disproportionate” costs
for the body corporate
arising from some identified use. The problem, as is obvious when stated like
that, is that it is impossible,
for any particular building, to determine
accurately for the future from a month to month, much less from year to year
how many occupants are likely to be in specific lots in a way which
leads to some reasonably accurate calculation of yearly costs
arising from such
occupancy. Evidence from persons “working in the industry” could
not possibly give an accurate determination
because their evidence would simply
be based upon experience of a particular building, or series of buildings.
Also, it could not
be based upon such a wide variety of buildings that some kind
of common allocated figure could be determined, because of the necessity
identify costs for
building. To the extent to which it might be led
to establish what any particular building generates, it could only be true for
the particular snapshot period of time taken for that building, which would be
determined by the actual character of the owners or
occupiers (even though they
might leave soon after) and to the extent, within that snapshot period, that
such owners or occupiers
were actual owner-occupiers or owner-lessors.
Accordingly, it is very unlikely that “a few time and motion studies
by experts in the field” would, in fact, help to determine an
accurate apportionment of such types of expenses. As for the
Tribunal starting
to begin a process of building up data which is contended would provide a
clearer picture “and thus a more
accurate result”, the very
criticisms that have just been canvassed show that that would be incredibly
dangerous to accept
that such apparent accuracy was capable of being confidently
relied upon. In any event, since all Lots here were originally designed
3 bedrooms:
there can be no
“bedroom” factor; and
the very fact
that particular Lot owners may have altered or modified their bedrooms proves
the point about how impossible it is to
have any faith in a
“methodology” that depends upon the particular owners’ whims
from time to time.
must be remembered that
referred not only to a capacity to
“show” that some lots give rise to particular costs which other lots
do not but also
to the requirement that one must be able to “readily
determine” the extent to which a lot creates costs, or consume services,
above or below the average. That is just not possible on any of the evidence so
far led in this, or any other, proceeding so far.
the acceptance by the Tribunal of the Amended L & P Report, and given that
the Tribunal agrees with the amended Table 5,
the appropriate order that the
Tribunal will make is that the lot entitlements of Lots 1 to 12 (inclusive) be
amended in accordance
with the recommended contribution schedule set out in the
Addendum of 23 July 2009. This arises from the conclusion that:
the current lot
entitlements in the Contribution Schedule [being 82 for Lots 1 to 8 (inclusive)
and 136 for Lots 9 to 12 (inclusive)]
are unequal;
it is just and
equitable in the circumstances for them not to be equal;
but the extent
of appropriate inequality is not what currently exists;
therefore, the
Contribution Schedule lot entitlements should be adjusted (as just
indicated).
canvassed earlier, it is important for the Body Corporate to pay heed to the
requirements of section 48(10) of the BCCM Act.
