T D CASTLE AND BRUCE KERCHER (EDS), SYDNEY: THE FRANCIS FORBES
SOCIETY FOR AUSTRALIAN LEGAL HISTORY, 2005, LXXXII, 1035
Bruce Kercher’s contribution to the study of legal history in Australia
is well known through his own impressive corpus of writings
and his involvement
in the Australian and New Zealand Law and History Society and latterly The
Francis Forbes Society for Australian
Legal History. Perhaps of longer term
significance will be his two web sites, which reproduce a selection of decisions
of Australia’s
first two Supreme Courts of New South Wales and Van
Diemen’s Land. These sites provide a wealth of material for legal
and their value can only grow.
this present volume of James Dowling’s
Select Cases
strengthens his contribution to the study of case law in Australia. He has been
joined as editor by Tim Castle, a barrister
and Research Fellow at the Division
of Law Macquarie University, where Kercher is a Professor.
When English barrister and law reporter James Dowling was appointed as the
third judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in
1828, he began a project
to produce the colony’s first set of law reports. Dowling served for
sixteen years, the last seven
as Chief Justice, and heard thousands of cases,
which in his organised and methodical way he wrote up in 268 general judicial
complete with index. From these, Dowling compiled nine notebooks of
cases (8 volumes of case reports and 1 volume of case notes)
with accompanying
head or marginal notes to describe the legal principle decided by the case.
Dowling called these notebooks his
Select Cases
. Castle and Kercher
rightly believe that they
‘contain a unique record of colonial life
and the interaction of law and the community in the colony, as witnessed by the
Court judges during the period 1828 to 1844’. Never before
published, the editors have included 465 of those cases (comprising
over 425,000
words of handwritten text) in this volume, ‘which convey a remarkable
sense of the legal heritage brought to New
South Wales by English law’.
Some cases are as short as a third of a page, while the longest is about 33
R v Farrell and Others
). The editors have reproduced the
handwritten cases and headnotes as found in the notebooks and explain their
decisions and modifications
in preparing the volume for publication. They note
that textual changes of the original are not indicated in the book itself. The
judgments are supplemented with tables of Cases Reported, of Statutes
Considered, and of Cases Judicially Considered. In addition
there is a Glossary
and an Index, all adding value to the judgments.
Dowling helped to develop ‘a distinct common law and legal culture in
Australia’ by trying to achieve the ‘practical
administration of
justice’ in New South Wales. He sought to adapt or mould English law to
‘local difficulties and peculiarities’
(as the editors put it
‘to reconcile the differences between colonial life and English
law’). Dowling was guided by ‘public
opinion’, which he felt
was the ‘legitimate foundation of political government’. By
‘public opinion’
he meant ‘the underlying notions of justice
in the society at the time’ as expressed by lawyers, the press, the
business interests and litigants drawn from all segments of society. His
main reason for preparing his
Select Cases
was to record the development
of ‘a distinct body of Australian common law by the early work of the
Supreme Court’. Some
of the most absorbing cases involve the issue of the
reception of English law. The editors are impressed with ‘the high
of Dowling’s judgments, which addressed complicated social
and legal questions in a sophisticated and learned way. One index
quality and soundness was the absence of appeals to the Privy Council.
Although the Macquarie Law website contains many of the cases reproduced
here, the advantage of this volume is in the arrangement
of the cases. The
editors have arranged the cases chronologically within twenty-two broad subject
categories. In addition Criminal
judgments are divided into general, murder and
stealing and Procedure judgments into costs, general, and trial. Although
cases were dominant in the Supreme Court, the
Select Cases
‘a strong civil flavour’, with 375 civil cases compared with 90
criminal cases. This reflects the concern at the
time to recognise and enforce
civil rights in actions for damages, the liberty of free and freed citizens, the
exercise of judicial
power, and freedom of speech. The largest number of
decisions relate to commercial matters, an area of special interest to Dowling.
Those judgments underline three major themes: consistently applying legal
principles to protect property rights, creating circumstances
conducive to
investment and expanding trade, and enforcing a minimum standard of commercial
morality. Topics such as Family, Land,
and Wills, Probate and Administration
highlight the nature of personal relationships in New South Wales. A number of
cases deal with
the rights of Aborigines and Convicts. The editors stress how
the cases show ‘a vibrant civil community’ and ‘the
process of interaction between the law and that community’ between 1828
The editors lament that in the past Dowling and his work have been overlooked
by legal and general historians. Dowling’s predecessor
Francis Forbes and
his successor Alfred Stephen have both received more attention. With the
publication of this valuable and well
chosen collection the editors will ensure
that he will not be neglected in the future.
