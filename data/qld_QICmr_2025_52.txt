email volume sent by me. Such claims inherently rely

, Council included
the following explanation for nonexistence of the requested documents:
The Principal Specialist Governance and Assurance provided a verbal
instruction to the Governance and Risk Officer to draft the "excessive
correspondence" letter. A verbal instruction was also given to the Business
Support Officer, Governance and Assurance to search Councils
records and provide
the number of documents as stated in the "Excessive Correspondence" letter to
the Governance and Risk Officer.
This information was provided verbally.
Therefore, there are no documents to provide as you have already been provided
with the "Excessive
Correspondence" letter.

that Council provide further information about any searches it had conducted and

RTI application. The figures included in the letter were
the result of a verbal discussion and verbal instruction, and no documentary

the reasons set out below, having examined the information available to me,
including the applicant’s submissions and Council’s
explanation of
the circumstances surrounding creation of the Letter, I am satisfied that there
are reasonable grounds to be satisfied
that documents in connection with the
Letter, as sought by the applicant, do not exist.
accept that the Letter contains references to the number of emails the applicant
is alleged to have sent Council. Council submits
that the references were

to the author of the Letter by the Business Support
Officer during the preparation of the Letter, through a concurrent review of
records management system.
into account the information set out in paragraph
officers to retrieve the information that was included in the Letter, and
preparation of the
Letter itself, I consider it is reasonable to conclude that
those communications between Council officers occurred verbally, concurrent
the drafting of the Letter. While I acknowledge that the applicant considers
that Council officers
have created additional written records in
the course of preparing the Letter, there is no information available to me,
the applicant’s assertions, to support that belief. Rather, the
evidence advanced by Council in its submissions is that the
communications only
occurred verbally. For these reasons, I find that there are reasonable grounds
to be satisfied that Council did
not create written records in connection with
the Letter (other than the Letter itself).
have had particular regard to the submissions directly provided by the author of
the Letter as outlined in paragraph
above. I am satisfied that Council has provided a reasonable explanation to
account for the nonexistence of documents and made appropriate
enquiries with
the officer who had direct involvement in drafting the Letter. Given the
explanation provided by Council, I do not
consider it is necessary for Council
to also demonstrate reasonable searches to justify the nonexistence of
documents, however, for
completeness, I find there are no further searches or
enquiries that Council could reasonably be expected to undertake in the
circumstances
of this case.
the reasons set out above, I find that there are reasonable grounds to be
satisfied that Council did not create written records
in connection with the
Letter (other than the Letter itself), and therefore, access may be refused to
