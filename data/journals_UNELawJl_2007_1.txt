Editor’s Note
Brian Simpson
The UNE Law Journal is usually published twice yearly in June and December.
This is the December issue of the Journal and will be
the only issue for 2007.
We will aim to publish an additional issue in 2008. Subscribers will not be
disadvantaged by this and will
receive the additional issue to compensate for
the lesser number in 2007.
