FOR DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL
Introduction
applicant in this proceeding has applied under
Administrative Tribunal Act 2004
) for a certified copy
of final orders made by Member East on 4 October 2024, and for the issue by a
judicial officer of a certificate
under s 86(2)(c) of the SAT Act that those
orders are appropriate for filing in the Supreme Court of Western
proceeding out of which the s 86 application arises involved a dispute
between the applicant, which is the strata company of
the scheme the subject of
strata plan 14729 (
), and the respondent, who is the registered
proprietor and occupant of one of the lots which constitute the Scheme
). It is not necessary for the purpose of dealing with this
application to set out the full background to the dispute. It is sufficient
say that it concerned the respondent's keeping his dog, 'Buddy', at the Scheme
without approval, and allowing - or failing to
prevent - certain behaviour by
Buddy at the Scheme, which the applicant argued constituted a breach of the
Scheme's by-laws and of
s 45(2) and
Strata Titles Act
4 October 2024, Member East declared that the respondent was, by keeping and
continuing to keep Buddy at the Scheme without approval,
and further by
permitting or failing to prevent Buddy from roaming freely, barking, and biting
another resident, in breach of the
relevant by-laws and provisions of the ST
Act. The Member subsequently made orders in the following terms:
to s 47(5) of the [ST] Act, the Tribunal orders the respondent must:
the dog Buddy permanently from the [Scheme] on or before 11 October 2024;
penalty of $100 for each contravention of the notices validly issued under s
47(1)(a) of the [ST] Act, being combined payment
of $400 on or before 5pm on 18
October 2024; and
cause or permit the dog Buddy to be present on [the Lot] or any other part of
the [Scheme] at any time.
the payment of the Applicant's enforcement expenses by the Respondent in the
liquidated sum of $15,007.10 pursuant to s 200(2)(o)(i)
of the [ST] Act on or
before 5pm on 1 November 2024.
95(1) of the [SAT Act] applies to this decision (apart from the monetary
application is otherwise dismissed.
applicant wishes to seek to enforce the Tribunal's orders in the Supreme Court
because it says that the respondent has not removed
Buddy permanently from the
reasons set out below I have concluded that it is appropriate for the orders to
be filed in the Supreme Court.

accordance with the objectives set out in s 9 of the SAT Act, to the extent
that they were relevant to the issues to be determined
in this application, I
have had regard to those emails.
Section 86 applications
of the Tribunal that are not monetary orders may be enforced in accordance with
s 86 of the SAT Act.
Section 86(2) of the SAT Act provides:
A person seeking to enforce a decision under this section may file in the
Supreme Court -
(a) a copy of the decision that a judicial member or the executive officer has
certified to be a true copy; and
(b) the person's affidavit as to the non-compliance with the decision; and
(c) a certificate from a judicial member stating that the decision is
appropriate for filing in the Supreme Court.
'decision' of the Tribunal includes an order, direction or determination of the
the documents referred to in s 86(2) are filed in the Supreme Court, the
'decision' is taken to be a decision of the Supreme
Court and may be enforced
accordingly,
including by proceedings for contempt.
Rogers and the
Owners of the Linx at Nexus Strata Plan
then President of the Tribunal, Pritchard JA, considered the meaning to be given
to the requirement in s 86(2)(c) that the certificate
given by the judicial
officer state that the decision 'is appropriate for filing in the Supreme
Court'. Taking into account the
statutory context and broader contextual
considerations, her Honour concluded
[T]he purpose behind s 86(2)(c) of the SAT Act is that the issue of the
certificate involves a screening or filtering process, performed
by a judge of
the Tribunal, to determine whether the decision is one which is appropriate
(that is, suitable, fitting or proper)
for filing in the Supreme Court, with the
consequence that it may be the basis for enforcement proceedings, including
proceedings
in the nature of contempt proceedings. That purpose will be served
by the judge considering whether there is any reason why it would
suitable, fitting or proper for the decision to be filed, and thus enforced,
including by contempt proceedings, in the Supreme
Court, but subject always to
the overarching principle that the proper administration of justice requires
that the Tribunal's orders
be complied with, and in the event that they are not,
that they are able to be enforced.
agree with and respectfully adopt, as I did in
Microlink Investments Pty
Ltd AFT Myalup Operations Trust t/as Myalup Beach Caravan Park and
Hampshire (WA) Parks Pty Ltd and
Honour's reasoning and conclusions.
, Pritchard JA identified several matters to which the
Tribunal must have regard in determining whether to grant a certificate under
the applicant for the certificate has given prima facie evidence of
non-compliance with an order of the Tribunal. The judge
determining the
application could not be satisfied that the relevant order is appropriate for
filing in the Supreme Court without
such evidence.
nature of the order made by the Tribunal. As Pritchard JA observed, it
would not be appropriate, for example, to enforce programming
directions in the Supreme Court.
the failure to comply with the Tribunal's order has been complete or partial.
Where a partial failure to comply with an order
of the Tribunal occurs, further
directions by the Tribunal in the exercise of its power to make ancillary orders
may facilitate complete
compliance, obviating the need for the issue of a
certificate.
the failure to comply is attributable to ambiguity in the Tribunal's order. An
order which is ambiguous or unclear is unlikely
to be appropriate for
enforcement in the Supreme Court because, as Pritchard JA observed, 'it could
not be the basis for a contempt
proceeding, nor could the Court appoint another
person to perform an order which [is] not clear in its terms'.
the party entitled to the benefit of the order has agreed to accept performance
in a different way than is required by the
terms of the order itself. If the
parties have reached agreement of this kind, it may not be appropriate to
enforce the order.
there are other means by which the party alleging non- or partial compliance
with the order could secure performance.
Honour noted that these matters are not exhaustive. Again, I adopt
her Honour's observation and explanation of the matters to
which the Tribunal
will have regard in determining an application for a certificate under s 86(2)
of the SAT Act.
regard to the numerous documents filed, it is clear that the essence of the
respondent's submission is that the Member's orders
cannot be enforced because
they are void ab initio because the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction in making
its decision. In advancing
that argument, he purports to rely on Howard J's
decision in
Ebeling v The Owners of Chateau Riversdale Strata Plan 14729
[2025] WASC 110
my view, the respondent's interpretation of Howard J's decision is incorrect.
His Honour found that the Member did not act in
excess of the Tribunal's
the Member exercised judicial power in determining the application brought by
the Strata Company against the
respondent,
Honour found that to do so was within the Member's authority as a Member of the
was that his Honour dismissed Mr Ebeling's
application for judicial review of Member East's
effect of that decision is that there is no order displacing the orders made by
the Member on 4 October 2024, that those orders
remain in force, and that
they are - subject to a judicial member of the Tribunal issuing a certificate
under s 86(2)(c) of the SAT
Act - capable of enforcement by the Supreme
matters raised by the respondent, including that the Member's orders breach his
human rights because Buddy is an assistance
animal, and his indication that he
either proposes to or has referred his concerns to the Corruption and Crime
Commission, the National
Anti-Corruption Commission, the Ombudsman Western
Australia and the Legal Practice Board of Western Australia, are matters
arguably go to the issue of whether the orders are appropriate for
filing in the Supreme Court. However, in my view, the Tribunal
proceed on the basis that its orders are valid, and the respondent's
concerns should, if necessary, be resolved elsewhere.
The applicant's evidence in support of the certificate
support of its application, the applicant relies upon the affidavit of Shivhan
Muruvan sworn on 5 June 2025.
his affidavit, Mr Muruvan swears that he is a solicitor employed by GV Lawyers
Pty Ltd and that he assists with the conduct of
this matter on behalf of the
also swears that:
(a) The respondent has failed, refused or
neglected to comply with the orders made on 4 October 2024 to remove his dog,
Buddy, from
the strata scheme by no later than 11 October 2024.
(b) On May 1 2025, the respondent was requested to permanently remove Buddy
from the strata scheme, but as of 2 June 2025, Buddy remained
on the premises.
applicant also relies on an admission made by the respondent in a directions
hearing before me on 4 August 2025 that Buddy remains
on the Scheme between
around 11.30 pm and 7.00 am
the material filed by the applicant in support of the application for the
certificate, I am satisfied of the following matters:
Tribunal's orders of 12 October 2023 are final orders;
orders of the Tribunal that the respondent must remove Buddy permanently from
the Scheme on or before 11 October 2024, and that
the respondent must not
cause or permit Buddy to be present on the Lot or any other part of the Scheme
at any time, are unambiguous;
affidavit of Mr Muruvan, in which he says that the respondent has failed,
neglected or refused to remove Buddy from the Scheme,
provides prima facie
evidence of non-compliance by the respondent with the orders as of 2 June 2025;
additionally,
I accept the respondent's statement during the 4 August 2025 directions
hearing that Buddy remains on the Scheme daily
between approximately
11.30 pm and
prima facie evidence of the respondent's non-compliance with the orders as of 4
August 2025;
is no basis for me to think that the applicant has agreed to accept performance
of the orders in some other way or at a later
time. No such evidence was given
by the applicant nor by the respondent; and
is no other means by which the applicant can secure the performance other than
by enforcing the order in the Supreme Court.
those circumstances, I am of the view that it is appropriate to issue the
certificate stating that the non-monetary orders of
the Tribunal, made on 4
October 2024 (i.e. order 2(a) and order 2(c)) are suitable for enforcement in
the Supreme Court.
will make an order in the following terms:
State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004
application for a certificate stating that the decision of Member East made on 4
October 2024 is appropriate for filing
in the Supreme Court is granted and a
certificate to that effect will be issued.
4 August 2025, programming orders were made in respect of any costs application
which is to follow this decision.
certify that the preceding paragraph(s) comprise the reasons for decision of the
State Administrative Tribunal.
