CONCLUSION AND DETERMINATION
INTRODUCTION
16 June 2016, ActewAGL Distribution (
) lodged with the Australian
Competition Tribunal (the
) an application for leave to apply for
review and an application for review of the final decision by the Australian
Energy Regulator
Final Decision - ActewAGL Distribution
Access Arrangement 2016 to 2021
for the access arrangement period comprising
1 July 2016 to 30 June 2021. The Final Decision was published on 26 May 2016,
with the access arrangement for the ACT, Queanbeyan and Palerang gas
distribution network 1 July 2016 - 30 June 2021.
16 June 2016, United Energy Distribution Pty Limited (
United Energy
lodged with the Tribunal an application for leave to apply to the Tribunal for
review of a reviewable regulatory decision and an
application for review of a
reviewable regulatory decision of the AER being the Distribution Determination
Final Decision - United Energy distribution determination 2016 to
16 June 2016 each of Jemena Electricity Networks (Vic) Ltd (
CitiPower Pty Ltd (
), Powercor Australia Ltd (
and AusNet Electricity Services Pty Ltd (
) filed their
applications.
26 August 2016, the Tribunal granted these applicants leave to apply for a
review of these decisions of the AER published on 26
May 2016 in respect of each
of the grounds for review set out in their applications.
notice dated the same day, the Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate
Change for the State of Victoria (the
) intervened in the
Victorian matters, ACT 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 of 2016 (see in particular [6(iv)] and
[6(vi)] below).
matters raised were in summary as follows:
(i) return on debt (transition): the
AER’s decision to reject the relevant applicants’ (ActewAGL and
Jemena) proposed
trailing average approach (with no period of transition) to
estimating the return on debt for use in the determination of the allowed
of return for the 2015/16 year and the 2016-21 access arrangement period
(together, 2015-21 period), and to instead determine
the relevant
applicants’ return on debt using an approach that involved a form of
transition from the previous 'on-the-day'
approach to the trailing average
(ii) value of imputation credits (gamma): the AER’s decision to reject the
relevant applicants’ (ultimately only ActewAGL
and Jemena) proposed value
of imputation credits of 0.25 for use in the estimation of the cost of corporate
income tax, and to instead
determine that the value of imputation credits ought
(iii) forecast inflation: the AER’s decision to reject ActewAGL’s
proposal to adopt a breakeven method estimate of inflation
for the 2015-21
period of 1.96 per cent, and to instead determine that forecast inflation ought
to be 2.18 per cent (United Energy
withdrew this ground of its application);
(iv) advanced metering infrastructure (
) rollout: the AER’s
decision the subject of the Minister’s intervention in the Tribunal and
affecting all applicants
except ActewAGL;
(v) labour price growth rates: the AER’s decision the subject of an
application to the Tribunal by only CitiPower and Powercor;
(vi) corporate overhead expenses: the AER’s decision the subject of the
Minister’s intervention in the Tribunal and affecting
only CitiPower and
(vii) return on debt (
): the AER’s decision the subject
of an application to the Tribunal only by AusNet; and
(viii) forecasting opex/self-insurance: the AER’s decision the subject of
an application to the Tribunal only by
grounds raised by ActewAGL were under the
National Gas Law
National Gas Rules
grounds raised by the other applicants were under of the
National Electricity
) and under the
National Electricity Rules
Where the laws and rules governing electricity and
gas networks are effectively the same we have dealt with them together, with
where relevant to variations or additions under the corresponding Law
convenience, the Tribunal is giving today three sets of reasons structured so
that issues common to more than one applicant are
dealt with together. For
example, the discussion of the return on debt grounds in this decision provides
the basis for the conclusions
on that issue in relation to Jemena. There were
also common submissions in relation to the value of imputation credits (gamma).
summary, these reasons deal with the issues in [6(i)]-[6(iv)] above, that is,
all except the following: [6(v)] labour price growth
rates and [6(vi)] corporate
overheads, where the reasons are to be found in the separate CitiPower and
Powercor decisions given today:

THE STATUTORY STRUCTURE
grounds for review are set out in s 246(1) of the
“materially preferable designated NGO decision” requirement is set
out in s 259(4a). The grounds for review have
recently been considered by a Full
Court of the Federal Court in
Australian Energy Regulator v Australian
Competition Tribunal (No 2)
[2017] FCAFC 79
s 246(1) of the
, an application under s 245(1) may be made only on
one or more of the following grounds:
(a) the AER made an error of fact in its findings of
facts, and that error of fact was material to the making of the decision;
(b) the AER made more than one error of fact in its findings of facts, and those
errors of fact, in combination, were material to
the making of the decision;
(c) the exercise of the AER’s discretion was incorrect, having regard to
all the circumstances;
(d) the AER’s decision was unreasonable, having regard to all the
circumstances.
259(4a) provided as follows:
In a case where the decision is a designated reviewable
regulatory decision, the Tribunal may only make a determination
(a) to vary the designated reviewable
regulatory decision under subsection (2)(b); or
(b) to set aside the designated reviewable regulatory decision and remit the
matter back to the AER under subsection
(c) the Tribunal is satisfied that to do so
will, or is likely to, result in a decision that is materially preferable to the
reviewable regulatory decision in making a contribution to the
achievement of the national gas objective (a
materially preferable
designated NGO decision
) (and if the Tribunal is not so satisfied the
Tribunal must affirm the decision); and
(d) in the case of a determination to vary the designated reviewable regulatory
decision – the Tribunal is satisfied that to
do so will not require the
Tribunal to undertake an assessment of such complexity that the preferable
course of action would be to
set aside the decision and remit the matter to the
AER to make the decision again.
(Original emphasis.)
244 defined “
materially preferable designated NGO
” by reference to s 259(4a)(c).
249(4b), (4c) and (5) should also be reproduced, as follows:
(4b) In connection with the operation of subsection (4a)
(and without limiting any other matter that may be relevant under this Law)
(a) The Tribunal must consider how the
constituent components of the designated reviewable regulatory decision
interrelate with each
other and with the matters raised as a ground for
(b) without limiting paragraph (a), the Tribunal must take into account the
revenue and pricing principles (in the same manner in
which the AER is to take
into account these principles under section 28); and
(c) the Tribunal must, in assessing the extent of contribution to the
achievement of the national gas objective, consider the designated
regulatory decision as a whole; and
(d) the following matters must not, in themselves, determine the question about
whether a materially preferable designated NGO decision
(i) the establishment of a
ground for review under section 246(1);
(ii) consequences for, or impacts on, the average annual regulated revenue of a
covered pipeline service provider;
(iii) that the amount that is specified in or derived from the designated
reviewable regulatory decision exceeds the amount specified
in section 249(2).
(4c) If the Tribunal makes a determination under
subsection (2)(b) or (c), the Tribunal must specify in its determination
(a) the manner in which it has taken into
account the interrelationship between the constituent components of the
designated reviewable
regulatory decision and how they relate to the matters
raised as a ground for review as contemplated by subsection (4b)(a); and
(b) in the case of a determination to vary the designated reviewable regulatory
decision – the reasons why it is proceeding
to make the variation in view
of the requirements of subsection
(5) A determination by the Tribunal affirming, varying
or setting aside the reviewable regulatory decision is, for the purposes of
Law (other than this Part), to be taken to be a decision of the original
decision maker.
national gas objective
” is defined in s 2(1) to mean
the objective set out in s 23, which provides as follows:
National gas objective
The objective of this Law is to promote efficient investment in, and efficient
operation and use of, natural gas services for the
long term interests of
consumers of natural gas with respect to price, quality, safety, reliability and
security of supply of natural

exceeds the lessor of $5,000,000 or 2 per
cent of the average annual regulated
revenue of the covered pipeline service provider.
limits on applicants were imposed as follows: by s 247, an application under s
245 in respect of a reviewable regulatory decision
of the present kind must be
made no later than 15 business days after the reviewable regulatory decision is
published in accordance
provisions of the
centrally relevant to the AER’s decision were
as follows:
Division 3 Building block approach
76 Total revenue
Total revenue is to be determined for each regulatory year of the
arrangement period
using the building block approach in which the building
blocks are:
(a) a return on the projected capital base for the year (See Divisions 4 and 5);
(b) depreciation on the projected capital base for the year (See Division 6);
(c) the estimated cost of corporate income tax for the year (See Division 5A);
(d) increments or decrements for the year resulting from the operation of an
incentive mechanism to encourage gains in efficiency
(See Division 9); and
(e) a forecast of operating expenditure for the year (See Division 7).
Division 5 Rate of return
87 Rate of return
(1) Subject to rule 82(3), the return on the projected capital base for each
regulatory year of the
access arrangement period
is to be calculated by
applying a rate of return that is determined in accordance with this rule 87
allowed rate of return
allowed rate of return
is to be determined such that it achieves
allowed rate of return objective
allowed rate of return objective
is that the rate of return for a
service provider is to be commensurate with the efficient financing costs of a
benchmark efficient
entity with a similar degree of risk as that which applies
to the service provider in respect of the provision of reference services
allowed rate of return objective
(4) Subject to subrule (2), the
allowed rate of return
for a regulatory
year is to be:
(a) a weighted average of the return on
equity for the
access arrangement period
in which that regulatory year
occurs (as estimated under subrule (6)) and the return on debt for that
regulatory year (as estimated
under subrule (8)); and
(b) determined on a nominal vanilla basis that is consistent with the estimate
of the value of imputation credits referred to in
(5) In determining the
allowed rate of return
regard must be had to:
(a) relevant estimation methods, financial
models, market data and other evidence;
(b) the desirability of using an approach that leads to the consistent
application of any estimates of financial parameters that
are relevant to the
estimates of, and that are common to, the return on equity and the return on
(c) any interrelationships between estimates of financial parameters that are
relevant to the estimates of the return on equity and
the return on
Return on equity
(6) The return on equity for an
access arrangement period
estimated such that it contributes to the achievement of the
allowed rate of
return objective
(7) In estimating the return on equity under subrule (6), regard must be had to
the prevailing conditions in the market for equity
Return on debt
(8) The return on debt for a regulatory year is to be estimated such that it
contributes to the achievement of the
allowed rate of return objective
(9) The return on debt may be estimated using a methodology which results in
(a) the return on debt for each regulatory
year in the
access arrangement period
being the same; or
(b) the return on debt (and consequently the
allowed rate of return
being, or potentially being, different for different regulatory years in the
access arrangement period
(10) Subject to subrule (8), the methodology adopted to
estimate the return on debt may, without limitation, be designed to result
the return on debt reflecting:
(a) the return that would be required by
debt investors in a benchmark efficient entity if it raised debt at the time or
before the time when the AER's
on the access arrangement
access arrangement period
(b) the average return that would have been required by debt investors in a
benchmark efficient entity if it raised debt over an
historical period prior to
the commencement of a regulatory year in the
access arrangement period
(c) some combination of the returns referred to in subrules (a) and (b).
(11) In estimating the return on debt under subrule
(8), regard must be had to the following factors:
(a) the desirability of minimising any
difference between the return on debt and the return on debt of a benchmark
efficient entity
referred to in the
allowed rate of return objective
(b) the interrelationship between the return on equity and the return on debt;
(c) the incentives that the return on debt may provide in relation to capital
expenditure over the
access arrangement period
, including as to the
timing of any capital expenditure; and
(d) any impacts (including in relation to the costs of servicing debt across
access arrangement periods
) on a benchmark efficient entity referred to
allowed rate of return objective
that could arise as a result of
changing the methodology that is used to estimate the return on debt from one
access arrangement period
to the next.
(12) If the return on debt is to be estimated using a
methodology of the type referred to in subrule (9)(b) then a resulting change
the service provider's total revenue must be effected through the automatic
application of a formula that is specified in the
on the access
arrangement for that
access arrangement period
Rate of return guidelines
(13) The AER must, in accordance with the
rate of return consultative
, make and publish guidelines (the
rate of return
rate of return guidelines
must set out:
(a) the methodologies that the AER proposes
to use in estimating the
allowed rate of return
, including how those
methodologies are proposed to result in the determination of a return on equity
and a return on debt in a way
that is consistent with the
allowed rate of
return objective
(b) the estimation methods, financial models, market data and other evidence
the AER proposes to take into account in estimating
the return on equity, the
return on debt and the value of imputation credits referred to in rule 87A.
(15) There must be
rate of return guidelines
force at all times after the date on which the AER first publishes the
of return guidelines
under these rules.
(16) The AER must, in accordance with the
rate of return consultative
, review the
rate of return guidelines
(a) at intervals not exceeding three years,
with the first interval starting from the date that the first
rate of return
are published under these rules; and
(b) at the same time as it reviews the Rate of Return Guidelines under clauses
6.5.2 and 6A.6.2 of the National Electricity Rules.
(17) The AER may, from time to time and in accordance
rate of return consultative procedure
, amend or replace the
rate of return guidelines
rate of return guidelines
are not mandatory (and so do not bind
the AER or anyone else) but, if the AER makes a
in relation to
the rate of return (including in an access arrangement draft
an access arrangement final
) that is not in accordance with
them, the AER must state, in its reasons for the
, the reasons
for departing from the guidelines.
(19) If the
rate of return guidelines
indicate that there may be a
change of regulatory approach by the
maker in future
, the guidelines should also (if practicable) indicate how
transitional issues are to be dealt with.
Division 5A
87A Estimated cost of corporate income tax
(1) The estimated cost of corporate income tax of a service provider for each
regulatory year of an
access arrangement period
be estimated in accordance with the following formula:
is an estimate of the taxable income for that regulatory year
that would be earned by a benchmark efficient entity as a result of
provision of reference services if such an entity, rather than the service
provider, operated the business of the service provider;
is the expected statutory income tax rate for that regulatory year
as determined by the AER; and
γ is the value of imputation
Division 6 Depreciation
88 Depreciation schedule
(1) The depreciation schedule sets out the basis on which the pipeline assets
constituting the capital base are to be depreciated
for the purpose of
determining a reference tariff.
(2) The depreciation schedule may consist of a number of separate schedules,
each relating to a particular asset or class of assets.
89 Depreciation criteria
(1) The depreciation schedule should be designed:
(a) so that reference tariffs will vary,
over time, in a way that promotes efficient growth in the market for reference
(b) so that each asset or group of assets is depreciated over the economic life
of that asset or group of assets; and
(c) so as to allow, as far as reasonably practicable, for adjustment reflecting
changes in the expected economic life of a particular
asset, or a particular
group of assets; and
(d) so that (subject to the rules about capital redundancy), an asset is
depreciated only once (ie that the amount by which the asset
is depreciated over
its economic life does not exceed the value of the asset at the time of its
inclusion in the capital base (adjusted,
if the accounting method approved by
the AER permits, for inflation)); and
(e) so as to allow for the service provider's reasonable needs for cash flow to
meet financing, non-capital and other costs.
(2) Compliance with subrule (1)(a) may involve deferral
of a substantial proportion of the depreciation, particularly where:
(a) the present market for pipeline services
is relatively immature; and
(b) the reference tariffs have been calculated on the assumption of significant
market growth; and
(c) the pipeline has been designed and constructed so as to accommodate future
growth in demand.
(3) The AER’s discretion under this rule is
See rule 40(2).
Calculation
of depreciation for rolling forward capital base from one access arrangement
period to the next
(1) A full access arrangement must contain provisions
governing the calculation of depreciation for establishing the opening capital
base for the next
access arrangement period
after the one to which the
access arrangement currently relates.
(2) The provisions must resolve whether depreciation of the capital base is to
be based on forecast or actual capital expenditure.
CONSULTATION BY THE TRIBUNAL
consultation process referred to in s 261(1)(b) of the
71R(1)(b) of the
is an additional step which the Tribunal must take
and, ideally, accommodate within the target time prescribed by s 260 of the
and s 71Q of the
. The Tribunal, having given leave to the
applicants to apply for review, sought information from the AER as to groups or
who might have an interest in the Tribunal’s review under
s 261(1)(b) of the
and s 71R(1)(b) of the
Tribunal then invited each of those groups or persons to indicate:
whether they
wished to consult with the Tribunal in relation to the Final Decisions;
the nature of
their proposed participation; and
consultation might best be carried out.
determined a protocol for the consultation, the Tribunal issued a Consultation
Agenda under which it provided for those who
wished to speak to the Tribunal,
either personally or on behalf of an organisation, to do so.
Tribunal conducted the first consultation session on 6 October 2016 at the
Federal Court of Australia in Melbourne. At that time,
the Tribunal heard
submissions by Ms R Sinclair, the Chief Executive Officer of Energy Consumers
Australia Ltd (
), Ms T Jelenic for the Public Interest Advocacy Centre
) and Ms R Held for the Consumer Utilities Advocacy Centre
ECA is an organisation formed by the COAG Energy Ministers Council as part of
the energy market reform package of 2012. Its oral
submissions were addressed
first to the new limited merits review process itself; secondly, to the
increased focus in that process
on the long-term interests of consumers; and
thirdly, to the need for the Tribunal’s decision to be a holistic,
preferable decision focused on the long-term interests of consumers.
The ECA also noted the revenue impacts which totalled $365.3
million, of which
60 per cent was said to be collected from residential and small business
consumers. It was submitted that consumers
did not think that the price
increases that those revenue increases would lead to were in their long-term
interests. The ECA had
conducted an energy consumer sentiment survey in July
2016 and the survey showed that customers valued reliability and competition
the energy sector but were not at all happy with the value for money they were
getting from energy services and they did not think
that the sector had their
interests at heart. The core question, it was submitted, was whether the
businesses had truly considered
the long-term interests of their customers in
putting forward the revised proposals and now in seeking the Tribunal’s
of the AER decisions with respect to the matters raised. It was submitted
that the long-term interests of consumers must be the Tribunal’s
consideration in determining that a materially preferable decision exists.
Emphasis was placed on the terms of s 71P of
. It was submitted
that the long-term interests of consumers were not delivered by any one factor
in isolation but rather required
balancing of those factors. The preference for
one outcome over another was to be determined with reference to the whole
and not the individual components of it and materiality was to be
determined with reference to the national electricity and gas objectives
nothing else.
addressed in particular s 71R(1)(b) of the
, concerning statutory
consultation requirements. PIAC sought to support and strengthen the
Tribunal’s role in promoting consumer
participation by, first, emphasising
that s 71R(1)(b) represented an important precondition to the

Tribunal conducted a second consultation session on 11 October 2016 at the
Federal Court of Australia in Canberra. The only registered
speakers at the
Canberra consultation withdrew before the start of proceedings. Consequently,
opportunity was provided for those
who had not registered to participate to make
submissions to the Tribunal. One person took that opportunity. It has not been
for the Tribunal to revisit those issues in the course of forming its
order to address concerns about the brevity of time allocated to user and
consumer groups and their inability to respond to the
written submissions and
replies of the applicants, on 18 October 2016 the Tribunal made a direction
giving leave to the user and

November 2016 in relation to the written submissions lodged by the parties. This
leave was taken up.
addition to the organisations already referred to, the Tribunal received and

SUMMARY OF APPLICANTS’ GROUNDS

submitted that Pt 8 of the
governed the AER’s decisions about
whether to approve access arrangements by service providers.
submitted that r 76 of the
adopted a building block approach to the
determination of total revenue to be derived from access arrangements. The
building blocks
relevant to the present grounds of review were: r 76(a) (return
on debt); r 76(b) (forecast inflation); and r 76(c) (gamma). We have
out at [18] above.
Return on debt
Specifically
in relation to return on debt, ActewAGL submitted, in summary as follows.
issue was whether the historical trailing average (
) approach should
be applied immediately to estimate the return on debt (which both ActewAGL and
Jemena proposed) or whether, as the
AER decided, the trailing average approach
should be phased in over a decade (the transition to trailing average
argued that the AER’s decision was predicated on a misconstruction of r 87
, equivalent to s 6.5.2 of the
. The AER’s
construction embodied a so-called zero net present value (
) criterion
over the ‘life of the Regulatory Asset Base (
interpreted ‘efficient financing costs’ as relating solely to
‘prevailing’ interest rates (but did
not require that those rates be
prevailing at any particular time); and did not require any consideration of the
financing practices
of the benchmark efficient entity (
contended that those concepts could not be reconciled to the text of r 87 of the
. Rather, it appeared that the AER had reached what it considered to
be the ‘right’ outcome, and then had sought to fit
that conclusion
into that rule, something ActewAGL argued was not a proper basis for statutory
construction.
Jemena argued the NPV = 0 criterion in the AER’s Final Decision was
incorrect. It had no explicit basis in r 6.5.2
and could not override the
requirements of that rule. Jemena also argued that the AER’s application
of the condition did not
reflect a proper NPV = 0 analysis in any event, because
the AER’s approach confused the RAB with debt instruments, and because
on-the-day approach only ever produced a random mismatch with the actual cost of
debt, and this random mismatch did not produce
some consistent value over
ActewAGL argued that the AER’s financial theory (ie, that the trailing
average approach should only be adopted if there
was a transition that preserved
“revenue neutrality” over the “life of the RAB” with the
on-the-day approach)
depended on its conclusion that the on-the-day approach
necessarily satisfied the allowed rate of return objective (
conclusion was untenable. Accordingly, the theoretical premise of the
AER’s decision (even leaving aside its construction
issues) was flawed.
contended that the phrase “efficient financing costs” in r 87(3) of
, equivalent of r 6.5.2(c) of the
, related to all
matters that bore upon the financing costs that the BEE, acting efficiently,
would incur during the regulatory period,
including its efficient financing
practices. It argued this construction was consistent with extrinsic material,

also argued that efficient financing costs are actual costs incurred by the
benchmark business under its debt instruments (facilities
and bonds) and,
because the business had contractual commitments to pay interest under those
instruments, there was a component of
future debt costs which was historically
predetermined. Consequently, Jemena argued the AER’s construction of the
term “efficient
financing costs” as the prevailing cost of debt (at
the time of making the distribution determination, or alternatively, at
particular point in time) was incorrect. Rather, the term “efficient
financing costs” in the allowed rate of
return objective was a reference
to costs that a benchmark service provider would incur adopting efficient
financing and risk management
practices, including practices that might be
expected in the absence of regulation, that is, the costs facing an efficient
Jemena contended the AER’s construction was therefore
inconsistent with the adoption of a trailing average approach, which
prevailing cost approach.
further argued that, because interest rates payable on existing debt instruments
held by the benchmark business were not at
the prevailing rate for new debt, the
prevailing rate could not sensibly be applied as a measure for the entire cost
of debt and
did not represent the efficient financing costs of that business.
Alternatively, and unlike both the on-the-day approach and the
transition approach, the trailing average approach calculated the efficient
financing costs of a benchmark business for

trailing average approach had no ‘impact’
on it for the purposes of
r 87(11)(d), the
equivalent of r 6.5.2(k)(4) of the
that it was common ground that a BEE would hold a staggered portfolio of debt,
and finance (or refinance) 10 per cent of that
portfolio each year, the trailing
average approach should therefore be applied without a transition.
although Jemena did have debt, it did not have hedge contracts. In addition to
arguing that neither the on-the-day approach
nor the AER’s transition
produced a measure of the efficient financing costs of a BEE in its position,
Jemena contended that
r 6.5.2(k)(4) provided a transition for businesses that
had changed their position in an irrecoverable way on the basis of the previous
regulatory regime (such as by entering into hedge contracts). Jemena was not
such a business, consequently, it argued, the AER’s
transition was not in
accordance with r 6.5.2 of the

/s 246 of the
regarding the nature of the grounds claimed
by the applicants did not arise because the AER had misconstrued the
equivalent of r 6.5.2 and had therefore exercised its discretion incorrectly.
further argued that the other reasons provided by the AER for a transition (the
avoidance of perceived bias and measurement
difficulties of the trailing average
approach) were not valid reasons for a failure to apply the ARORO.
also argued that the AER’s change in reasoning was not foreshadowed to the
service providers, in contravention of r 11.60.4(k)
16(1)(b) of the
respect of this ground, ActewAGL relied upon submissions at that time advanced
jointly on behalf of all network applicants. However,
by letter dated 21 July
2017, all applicants other than ActewAGL and Jemena abandoned their grounds of
review in respect of gamma.
ActewAGL and Jemena contended for a value of 0.25
for gamma rather than the value of 0.4 applied by the AER. We set out their
submissions
on this topic at [240]-[260] below.
Forecast inflation
Specifically
in relation to forecast inflation, ActewAGL submitted, in summary as
forecast of inflation was a component of the depreciation building block in r
76(b) of the
inflation on the capital base must be deducted from the depreciation allowance
in each regulatory year to avoid “double
counting” of inflation
(given that the return on capital building block was calculated by reference to
the inflation adjusted
capital base).
proposed a forecast of inflation of 2.19 per cent (later updated to 1.96 per
cent) based on the Breakeven Forecasting Methodology,
which provided a
market-based estimate of inflation.
AER was required to accept ActewAGL’s forecast of inflation (and the
methodology used to create it) unless the AER was positively
satisfied that
ActewAGL’s forecast: (a) was not arrived at on a reasonable basis; and (b)
did not represent the best forecast
the Final Decision, the AER imposed a forecast of inflation of 2.18 per cent
based on the AER’s Forecasting Methodology,
which relied on RBA forecasts
for the first three years of the 2015-21 period, and then the mid-point of the
RBA’s long-term
inflation target range for a further seven years.
was expert evidence before the AER that Australia had been experiencing very low
inflation, and in prevailing low interest rate
conditions, the RBA had little
capacity to use monetary policy to lift inflation.
submitted that the AER did not attempt a meaningful analysis of these issues.
Rather, the AER assumed that its Forecasting
Methodology should be adopted
unless persuaded otherwise. Further, the AER concluded that any change to its
forecasting methodology
should only occur after industry wide consultation

to forecast inflation under r 60 of the
Materially preferable designated NGO decision requirement
to the “materially preferable designated NGO decision requirement”
in s 259 of the
, ActewAGL submitted:
(1) a decision that was made according to law was
properly construed as being a “materially preferable designated NGO
when compared to a purported decision that was not in accordance
with law; that was to be contrasted with a decision that was
“preferable”,
in the sense that, if there were a range of decisions
that were correct in law, the decision that was ultimately achieved was the
that could have been made;
(2) the term “likely” in s 259(4a)(c) meant that there was a
real chance or possibility, rather than that it was “more
likely than
not”, that varying or remitting the decision will result in a materially
preferable designated NGO decision;
(3) there was no requirement for the Tribunal to engage in “crystal ball
gazing”, whereby it must consider the decision
as made by the AER, and
compare that with a counterfactual in which a different decision was made by the
AER on remittal with a different
result, in order to determine whether the
requirement was met. Rather, a simple comparative exercise was called for,
whereby the
grant of relief was compared with the existing regulatory
(4) if its return on debt and forecast inflation grounds were made out, then the
AER had made a decision about ActewAGL’s allowable
revenue on a basis that
was not authorised by the NGR. A decision that did not apply the NGR, and which
the AER was not authorised
to make, was incapable of furthering the NGO. A
decision which did apply the NGR, on the other hand, was more likely to further
NGO, and was therefore likely to be materially preferable to a decision
which did not. Accordingly, either a remitted or varied decision,
which resulted
in a decision being made in accordance with law, will necessarily be materially
preferable;
(5) the AER’s errors otherwise resulted in the Final Decision not
furthering the NGO, in that the Final Decision did not apply
the building block
methodology in the NGR in accordance with its terms, and therefore did not allow
ActewAGL a reasonable opportunity
to recover its efficient costs of providing
services pursuant to the access arrangement. The AER had not asserted (nor was
aware of) any offsetting interrelationships or generosities in the
Final Decision. Thus, there would likely be material adverse consequences
the long-term interests of consumers absent error
correction.
Tribunal turns now to consider in more detail the submissions of the parties in
respect of each of these subject matters.
RETURN ON DEBT
Debt Transition
principal issue here is whether the historical trailing average (
approach to estimating the return on debt for use in the determination of the
allowed rate of return for the 2015-16 year and the
2016-21 access arrangement
period (together, 2015-21 period) should be applied immediately (which ActewAGL
and Jemena proposed in
their Revised Access Arrangement Proposal and Revised
Regulatory Proposal, respectively) or whether there should be a transition
the trailing average (
) approach, with the HTA phased in from the
previous on-the-day approach over a decade (which the AER decided in both
cases). Both
of those applicants had originally proposed a hybrid
transition.
was common ground between the parties that the HTA approach would assume that
the BEE holds a staggered portfolio of fixed rate
debt and refinances 10 per
cent of that debt each year at prevailing 10-year interest rates. The interest
rate used to calculate
the allowance for debt in each regulatory year under that
approach is a simple average of the current and previous nine years’
prevailing interest rates.
TTA approach is a transition from the previous on-the-day approach that fixed
the interest rate used to calculate the allowance
for debt at the rate
prevailing at, or close to, the start of each regulatory period for the whole of
that period (currently five
years). The transition lasts ten years, so that the
prevailing/on-the-day rate applies in the first year of the new regulatory
a weighted average of 90 per cent of the initial on-the-day rate and
10 per cent of the second-year prevailing rate applies in the
second year;
a weighted average of 80 per cent of the on-the-day rate and 10 per cent of each
of the second-year and third-year prevailing
rate applies in the third year; and
so on until the tenth year when the rate applying in that year is a simple
average of the current
and previous nine years’ prevailing interest rates,
as would apply with the HTA approach. This may be called a
“fully-implemented”
TTA and HTA approaches “roll in” 10 per cent of the new prevailing
rate at the beginning of each regulatory year.
Consequently, the practical
difference between the TTA and HTA approaches is that the TTA approach
substitutes the interest rate
prevailing at the beginning of the first
regulatory period for all the historical rates prior to that time that would
have been averaged
into the HTA approach.
AER’s imposition of a transition to the HTA approach is essentially the
same issue as was raised in relation to debt by
the parties in
and, more narrowly focussed on only the debt risk premium (
component of debt costs, in
Application by SA Power Networks
the Tribunal’s focus was on the
rationale for transition, particularly the proper definition of the BEE and
interpretation
of r 6.5.2(k)(4) of the
(equivalent to
r 87(11)(d) of the
). The Tribunal in that matter concluded that
the AER had misinterpreted the definition of a BEE as a regulated entity with
debt that required transition to the HTA approach. The AER subsequently
adopted a different rationale for applying the TTA approach
in the recent
determinations for SA Power Networks, ActewAGL and Jemena, relying on an implied
requirement of the NEO and revenue
and pricing principles (
) to ensure
a “zero NPV” condition was satisfied “over the life of the
RAB”. That is, over time, the net present
value of the allowance for the
return on capital would just cover the cost of the regulated asset base. This
rationale was contested
, but was accepted by the Tribunal in that
matter. Since then, the Full Court has decided an application for judicial
review of the
decision, as discussed in what
Regulatory framework
issue was raised by ActewAGL under the
and Jemena under the
. As we have noted, there are substantial parallels in the relevant
provisions of both the
. The discussion to follow refers to both sets of provisions where
framework governing the cost of capital is set out in r 87 of the
; the return on debt specifically is dealt with in rr 87(8) to
(12). These rules are the result of substantial recent revision, as
explained in
the AEMC’s Rule Determination:
National Electricity Amendment
(Economic Regulation of Network Service Providers) Rule 2012
Gas Amendment (Price and Revenue Regulation of Gas Services) Rule 2012
November 2012 (
2012 Rule Amendments
87(1) of the
requires a calculation of the allowed rate of return in
accordance with the terms of r 87 itself. Rules 87(2) and (3) are the main
provisions. We have set them out at [18] above.
to the 2012 Rule Amendments, the revenue allowance for the cost of debt was
explicitly set as the sum of measures of the risk-free
rate and the DRP, the
sources for both of which were specified in some detail. The effect was to
apply, at the beginning of a regulatory
period, an estimate of the long-run cost
of debt based on interest rates prevailing during a period close to the start of
the regulatory
interest rates constantly change with economic conditions, so the prevailing
rate (for instance, for suitably rated (BBB+),
long-term (10-year) debt) at the
start of a regulatory period is unlikely to be the rate that will apply to new
debt over the course
of that period. In the lead-up to the 2012 Rule Amendments
governing the costs of capital, the AEMC noted concerns that the then
on-the-day approach encouraged risk management practices by service providers
that would not occur in the absence of such
regulation. It considered that the
then current approach may lead to various mismatches between the regulatory
estimate allowed by
the regulator and the actual interest rate exposures of
those service providers that employ debt management practices that are not
closely aligned with the benchmark assumptions.
2012 Rule Amendments addressed this by giving the AER the discretion to choose
between the on-the-day approach, an HTA approach,
or some combination of these
two approaches. It described the rule as setting out at a very broad level the
characteristics of these
three approaches to estimating the return on debt that
could reasonably be contemplated by a regulator. The AEMC intended that the
regulator could adopt more than one approach to estimating the return on debt,
having regard to different risk characteristics of
benchmark efficient service
providers. The regulatory revenue allowance for debt is now required to be
estimated so as to contribute
to the ARORO (
s 6.5.2(h)), that is, to provide a service provider with a rate of return
commensurate with the efficient financing costs of a benchmark
efficient entity
with a similar degree of risk as the service provider in respect of the
provision of standard control services.
the new rules, if the AER estimates the return on debt using a methodology that
results in different or potentially different
rates in each regulatory year
(r 87(9)(b)), the AER’s choice of method must be “effected
through the automatic application
of a formula” specified in the
AER’s final decision at the start of the regulatory period.
summarised in the AEMC 2012 Rule Amendments, at page 8:
2.4.3 Rate of return
The final rule introduces a new framework for determining the rate of return. It
provides that the allowed rate of return for a NSP
must meet an objective
related to the efficient financing costs of a benchmark efficient NSP with a
similar degree of risk as that
which applies to the NSP subject to the decision.
The final rule provides the regulator with sufficient discretion on the
methodology
for estimating the required return on equity and debt components but
also requires the consideration of a range of estimation methods,
models, market data and other information so that the best estimate of the rate
of return can be obtained overall that
achieves the allowed rate of return
The final rule also provides for the allowed rate of return to reflect changing
circumstances so that the application of the framework
should result in the best
overall estimate of the rate of return in any case that is commensurate with
efficient financing costs.
This should ensure sufficient funds are attracted for
network investment, while minimising costs for electricity
2012 Rule Amendments did not alter the task for the AER: to set an allowance for
the cost of capital that was the product of the
projected capital base (the RAB
in the case of the
) and a weighted average of the returns on equity
and debt (r 87(4)(a)). Nor did they change the previously understood cost
- that the returns on equity and debt were estimates of the long-run
returns on those components of capital costs. As noted by the
AEMC in the quote
at [71] above, the new rules “introduce a new framework”, granting
the AER “discretion on the
methodology for estimating the required rate of
return”, but not changing the underlying cost concept, summarised by the
as: “the economic understanding that the cost of capital (equity and
debt) is a forward-looking opportunity cost”.
the requirement (r 87(2)) for the overall rate of return on capital to
achieve the ARORO (defined in r 87(3) that the rate
of return is
commensurate with the efficient financing costs of a BEE with a similar degree
of risk), under r 87(5) the AER is required
to have regard to:
(a) relevant estimation methods, financial
models, market data and other evidence;
(b) the desirability of using an approach that leads to the consistent
application of any estimates of financial parameters that
are relevant to the
estimates of, and that are common to, the return on equity and the return on
(c) any interrelationships between estimates of financial parameters that are
relevant to the estimates of the return on equity and
the return on
AER is also required (r 87(11)) to have regard to:
(a) the desirability of minimising any
difference between the return on debt and the return on debt of a benchmark
efficient entity
referred to in the allowed rate of return objective;
(b) the interrelationship between the return on equity and the return on
(c) the incentives that the return on debt may provide in relation to capital
expenditure over the access arrangement period, including
as to the timing of
any capital expenditure; and
(d) any impacts (including in relation to the costs of servicing debt across
access arrangement periods) on a benchmark efficient
entity referred to in the
allowed rate of return objective that could arise as a result of changing the
methodology that is used
to estimate the return on debt from one access
arrangement period to the next.
What the AER decided
AER decided in the Final Decisions that it would not depart from the return on
debt methodology that it had proposed in Chapter
6 of its December 2013 Better
Regulation Rate of Return Guideline (
RoR Guideline
) and its Draft
Decision for ActewAGL and Preliminary Decision for Jemena. At page 10 of
Attachment 3 of the Jemena Final Decision
the AER said, with an equivalent
statement in the ActewAGL Final Decision (omitting footnotes):
We are satisfied that the allowed rate of return ... we
determined achieves the allowed rate of return objective (ARORO). That is,
are satisfied that this allowed rate of return is commensurate with the
efficient financing costs of a benchmark efficient entity
with a similar degree
of risk as that which applies to Jemena Electricity Networks (JEN) in providing
standard control services.
and later at pp 11-12 of attachment 3:
Consistent with our preliminary decision, we agree there
should be a transition from the on-the-day approach to the trailing averaging
approach to estimating the return on debt. However, we disagree with the hybrid
form of transition proposed in JEN's (initial) regulatory
In its revised proposal, JEN departed from its initial position to apply a
transition to the trailing averaging approach at all.
It now proposes to not
apply a transition (that is, to immediately move to a trailing average
approach). We disagree with JEN on
this and a number of other components of the
rate of return.
and further at p 13:
This gradual transition will occur through updating 10
per cent of the entire return on debt each year to reflect prevailing market
conditions in that year (a full transition). This approach is consistent with
the approached we proposed in the Guideline and adopted
in the preliminary
the ARORO, the AER said, at pages 17 and 18 (omitting footnotes):
We are to determine the allowed rate of return such that
it achieves the ARORO. The objective is:
...that the rate of return for a
distribution network service provider is to be commensurate with the efficient
financing costs of
a benchmark efficient entity with a similar degree of risk as
that which applies to the distribution network service provider in
the provision of standard control services.
The regulatory regime is an ex-ante (forward looking)
regime. As such, we consider a rate of return that meets the ARORO must provide
ex-ante compensation for efficient financing costs. This return would give a
benchmark efficient entity a reasonable opportunity
to recover at least its
efficient financing costs. This is a zero net present value (NPV) investment
condition, which can be described
as follows:
The zero NPV investment criterion has two
important properties. First, a zero NPV investment means that the ex-ante
expectation is
that over the life of the investment the expected cash flow from
the investment meets all the operating expenditure and corporate
taxes, repays
the capital invested and there is just enough cash flow left over to cover
investors’ required return on the
capital invested. Second, by definition
a zero NPV investment is expected to generate no economic rents. Thus, ex-ante
no economic
rents are expected to be extracted as a consequence of market power.
The incentive for investment is just right, encouraging neither
investment, nor too little.
Under our regulatory framework, a benchmark efficient
entity’s assets are captured in its RAB. The return on capital building
block allows a benchmark efficient entity to finance (through debt and equity)
investment in its network. Because investments usually
carry a degree of risk,
to satisfy the zero NPV condition the allowed rate of return must be sufficient
to compensate a benchmark
efficient entity's debt and equity investors for the
risk of their investment.
AER went on to discuss, at pages 18-19, efficient financing costs:
A key concept in the ARORO is ‘efficient financing
costs’. Because the market for capital finance is competitive, a benchmark
efficient entity is expected to face competitive prices in the market for funds.
Therefore, we consider efficient financing costs
are reflected in the prevailing
market cost of capital (or WACC) for an investment with a similar degree of risk
as that which applies
to a service provider in respect of the provision of
regulated services.
We consider employing a rate of return that is commensurate with the prevailing
market cost of capital (or WACC) is consistent with
the zero NPV investment
condition (see above). We also consider economic efficiency more generally is
advanced by employing a rate
of return that reflects rates in the market for
capital finance. Similarly, Partington and Satchell interpret efficient
costs as the opportunity cost of capital, which is a market rate of
return for assets with a given level of risk.
page 24, the AER said the following regarding the benchmark efficient entity
(omitting a footnote):
We consider a benchmark efficient entity
similar degree of risk as that which applies to the service provider in the
provision of its regulated services
would be ‘a pure play, regulated
energy network business operating within Australia’ acting efficiently. To
this position, it is essential to understand the relationship and
distinction between risk and expected returns. All else being equal,
we consider
an unregulated monopoly will have higher risk and higher expected returns than a
regulated monopoly. This is because
regulation:
mitigates monopolies from being able to extract monopoly
rents, thereby constraining potential profits
increases the certainty of the revenue stream, thereby reducing risk.
For clarity, regulation reduces both risks that are
compensated through the rate of return (for example, demand risk) and risks that
would not be compensated through the rate of return (for example, by allowing
cost pass throughs for unsystematic risks such as industry-specific
tax changes
or geographic-specific natural disasters). We only focus on risks that are
compensated through the rate of return (compensable
what it makes clear is a later addition to its thinking, the AER said at page
3-279, within Appendix H, which deals in detail with
the return on debt approach
(omitting footnotes):
It is important to note that a debate has now arisen,
since the submission of proposals in the matters under consideration, as to
whether a benchmark efficient entity would be unregulated. In their recent
revised proposals, service providers submitted that a
benchmark efficient entity
with a similar degree of risk in respect of the provision of regulated services
must be an unregulated
business. This followed the Tribunal hearing in an
application for review of revenue determinations by Networks NSW, and ActewAGL
which resulted in the Tribunal recently forming the view that a benchmark
efficient entity referred to in the ARORO is likely not
a regulated
and further at page 3-280:
Nevertheless, even if a benchmark efficient entity was
necessarily unregulated, we do not consider this would affect our conclusions.
Our approach to the cost of debt would be applicable to an unregulated firm if
it had a similar degree of risk to the service provider
in providing regulated
services. Further, irrespective of whether a firm is regulated or not, efficient
financing costs reflect the
current (or prevailing) forward looking costs
observed in capital markets.
AER referred to the 2012 Rule Amendments in support of its imposition of a
transition as follows in Appendix H, at pages 3-290
to 3-291 (footnotes
We note that when undertaking the rule change in 2012
the AEMC added in clause 6.5.3(k)(4) that states (emphasis added):
(k) In estimating the return on debt under
paragraph (h), regard must be had to the following factors...
(4) any impacts (including in relation to the costs of servicing debt across
regulatory control periods) on a benchmark efficient
entity referred to in the
allowed rate of return objective that could arise
as a result of changing
the methodology
that is used to estimate the return on debt from one
regulatory control period to the next.
This clause is explicit in requiring us to have regard
to any impacts on a benchmark efficient entity that could arise as a result
change of methodology. This would include having regard to any material changes
in the present value of a benchmark efficient
entity's regulated revenue purely
due to changing the debt estimation methodology. If such changes increased a
benchmark efficient
entity's value, then this would benefit its equity holders
at the expense of consumers. Conversely, if such changes decreased a benchmark
efficient entity's value, then this would cost its equity holders but provide a
short term financial benefit to consumers (which
may not be a long-term benefit
to the extent this results in underinvestment). As such, this methodological
change may also have

this background, the AER argued in broad terms as follows.
considered that the on-the-day approach could contribute to the ARORO and was
therefore open to it. In particular, the present
value of a benchmark efficient
entity’s allowed revenues would be sufficient to compensate it for its
efficient financing costs.
trailing average approach, once fully implemented in the manner it proposed,
would similarly compensate a benchmark efficient
entity for its efficient
financing costs. Compared to the on-the day approach, a trailing average
approach would lead to less volatile
cash flows (a smoother price path over the
long run, across regulatory periods); would in the view of some stakeholders
reduce service
providers’ risk; and receive broad stakeholder support.
Thus the AER favoured moving from the on-the-day approach to the trailing
average approach. The question was how to implement the change.
AER’s method of phasing in the trailing average approach would contribute
to the ARORO because it would be approximately
revenue neutral in the sense that
it would not change the benchmark efficient entity’s present value. These
conclusions about
the three methodologies – on-the-day, fully implemented
trailing average, and phased-in trailing average - were supported by
mathematical analysis of present value calculations.
contrast, the AER argued, the applicants’ proposed methodology would
over-compensate them. The allowed return on debt would
be greater than the
benchmark efficient entity’s efficient financing costs. This was because
the current market cost of debt
was considerably below the average market cost
of debt over the past nine years. Implementing the trailing average approach
immediately
would effectively treat the applicants as if they now faced a cost
of debt considerably higher than in fact they do face. It would
thus not produce
a rate of return that would be commensurate with achievement of the ARORO.
instead, the trend of interest rates had been up rather than down, immediate
implementation of the trailing average approach would
cause under-compensation
of the benchmark efficient entity, contrary to the ARORO.

did not rely on a common set of submissions.

attack on the AER’s decision had a number of elements, as follows:
“efficient financing costs of a benchmark efficient entity with a similar
degree of risk as that which applies to [Jemena]”
(r 6.5.2(c)) are actual
costs incurred by the benchmark business under its debt instruments (facilities
and bonds). The business
has contractual commitments to pay interest under those
instruments. This business would hold a staggered portfolio of fixed rate

benchmark business for Jemena.
construction of “efficient financing costs” is that they are
prevailing costs.
The interest
rates payable on existing debt instruments held by the benchmark business are
not at the prevailing rate for new debt
in 2016. Only new debt taken out by the
business in 2016 is at the prevailing rate. Therefore, the prevailing rate
cannot sensibly
be applied as a measure for the entire cost of debt.
on-the-day approach was required under the previous rules, the rules were
amended and now give primacy to the allowed rate
of return objective.
“on-the-day” approach (which is continued by the AER’s
transition, in decreasing weights over 10 years) is neither
the prevailing cost
of debt nor a measure of the “efficient financing costs” of Jemena.
The on-the-day approach is only
an appropriate measure for a business that
finances (e.g. a new entrant) or refinances all of its debt requirements at the
commencement
of the regulatory control period. That is not Jemena, or an
appropriate benchmark for Jemena. The on-the-day approach and the AER’s
transition do not calculate the “efficient financing costs of a benchmark
efficient entity” in the case of Jemena. Thus
the AER’s transition
is not in accordance with clause 6.5.2 of the
new “NPV = 0” approach from its Final Decision is not found in r
6.5.2 and cannot override the requirements
of r 6.5.2. In any case, the analysis
is incorrect. For both the on-the-day approach and the transition to a trailing
average, it
applies an interest rate that does not represent the efficient
financing costs of an existing business. Moreover, the notion of revenue
neutrality is meaningless in relation to debt costs. It makes no sense to speak
of debt costs over the life of assets.
Rule 6.5.3(k)(4)
provides a transition for businesses that have changed their position in an
irrecoverable way on the basis of the
previous regulatory regime such as by
entering into hedge contracts. Jemena is not such a firm.
Other reasons
given by the AER for a transition – avoidance of bias and measurement
difficulties – are not valid reasons
to fail to apply the ARORO.

a similar vein but with some variations, ActewAGL submitted, in summary, as
decision is predicated on a misconstruction of r 6.5.2 of the
AER’s construction: embodies a so-called ‘NPV = 0’ criterion
over the “life of the RAB”; interprets
“efficient financing
costs” as relating
to “prevailing” interest
rates (but does not require that those rates be prevailing at any particular
time); and does
not require any consideration of the financing practices of the
Those concepts
cannot be reconciled to the text of r 6.5.2. Rather, it appears that the AER has
reached what it considered to be the
‘right’ outcome, and then had
sought to fit that conclusion into r 6.5.2. That is not a proper basis for
statutory construction.
Further, the
AER’s financial theory (ie, that the trailing average approach should only
be adopted if there is a transition
that preserves “revenue
neutrality” over the “life of the RAB” with the on-the-day
approach) depends on its
conclusion that the on-the-day approach necessarily
satisfies the ARORO. That conclusion is untenable. Accordingly, the theoretical
premise of the AER’s decision (even leaving aside its construction issues)
contended that the phrase “efficient financing costs” in r 6.5.2(c)
related to all matters that bear upon the
financing costs that the BEE, acting
efficiently, would incur during the regulatory period, including its efficient
financing practices.
This construction is consistent with the extrinsic
material, the text of r 6.5.2 of the
, and the Ausgrid and
EnergyAustralia Decisions.
ActewAGL has no
debt. Therefore, the change in debt methodology to the trailing average approach
has no “impact” on it
for the purposes of r 6.5.2(k)(4) of the
. Given that it is common ground that a BEE would hold a staggered
portfolio of debt, and finance (or refinance) 10 per cent of that
portfolio each
year, the trailing average approach should therefore be applied without a
transition.
Given that it
was common ground that the trailing average methodology was most likely to
represent the debt portfolio of a business
in a competitive market, then,
consistently with the conclusions expressed by the Tribunal in
the efficient financing costs of ActewAGL for the purposes of r 87(3) of the
ought to have been determined on that basis. That is to say, ActewAGL
should have been allowed a return on debt based on the trailing
average approach
without a transition.

Decisions, the AER decided that:

achievement of
the allowed rate of return objective;
(b) switching immediately from an on-the-day approach to a trailing average

The AER did not

a trailing average approach.
No error arises
by reason that the Final Decisions explained the AER’s reasons in greater
depth than the Preliminary Decisions,
including by reference to the underlying
economic principles.

in a materially preferable NEO
The Full Court’s decision
mentioned above, after the hearing by the Tribunal in the present proceedings,
the Full Court’s decision on its judicial
review of the Tribunal’s
decision was handed down, on 24 May 2017. That decision is

further submissions.
relevantly made the following submissions in respect of the Full Court’s
First, the Court concluded that the required benchmarking
for the purposes of cl 6.5.2(c) extends to the debt management practices
BEE. In particular:
[531]-[533], in the context of discussing the 2012 Rule Amendments, the Court
implicitly accepted that the purpose underlying cl
6.5.2 was to provide an
incentive for service providers to adopt efficient financing practices, and that
to that end, ‘the
required benchmarking is with respect to the efficiency
financing and risk management practices
that are to be expected
according to the disciplines of a workably competitive market’; and
[571] the Court concluded that: cl 6.5.2(c) is an ‘efficiency
yardstick’ of the costs that would be incurred in a workably
competitive
market; that considered against that yardstick, ‘the service
debt management practices
will either be efficient or
inefficient’; and that for the purposes of considering whether an
‘impact’ of the kind
referred to in cl 6.5.2(k)(4) exists, it is
relevant to consider whether the service provider has ‘already implemented
debt structure
that satisfies a required aspect of the intended
benchmark efficiency’ in cl 6.5.2(c) (that ‘required aspect’
the service provider’s debt management practices) [emphasis
The effect of these conclusions is that the expression
‘efficient financing costs’ in cl 6.5.2(c) is not (as the AER
now contends) confined solely to interest rates.
Secondly, the Court concluded that the service provider’s actual debt
management practices are relevant to considering whether
an ‘impact’
of the kind referred to in cl 6.5.2(k)(4) exists that should be taken into
account when transitioning from
one methodology for estimating return on debt to
another. In particular:
[557]-[560], the Court acknowledged that the AEMC’s purpose in
promulgating the 2012 Rule Amendments (including cl 6.5.2(k)(4))
was to address
the debt management practices that service providers had entered into in
reliance on previous methodologies for estimating
return on debt deployed by the
[571], as discussed above, the Court reasoned, when considering whether an
‘impact’ of the kind contemplated by cl
6.5.2(k)(4) exists, it is
relevant to consider whether the particular service provider's actual
circumstances, including its debt
management practices, are efficient when
assessed against the benchmark.
Those conclusions cannot be reconciled with the AER’s
current construction of cl 6.5.2(k)(4) as being concerned only with maintaining
revenue neutrality for the BEE between two methodologies over the ‘life of
the RAB’ or 10 year term of the BEE’s
debt portfolio. Not only does
the AER’s construction not allow for any consideration of debt management
practices (as it is
focussed solely on interest rates), but it also does not
allow for any consideration of the individual circumstances of the service
provider (i.e. its debt management practices) in considering the
‘impact’ of a change in debt methodology.
Thirdly, the Reasons are directed to the assessment of efficient costs during
the current regulatory period, and the ‘impact’
of a change in debt
estimation methodology from the previous regulatory period to the current
regulatory period (see especially at
[571]-[573]). The Reasons do not
contemplate assessment of efficient financing costs over multiple past and
future regulatory periods.
The Reasons therefore cannot be reconciled with the
AER’s current construction and application of the ARORO, which is that
assessment of ‘efficient financing costs’ is to be assessed over the
‘life of the RAB’, which spans an
indeterminate number of regulatory
periods (or alternatively, the 10 year term of the BEE’s debt portfolio,
which spans the
two previous regulatory periods).
Based on its construction of cll 6.5.2(c) and 6.5.2(k)(4), the Court concluded
that no impacts of the kind referred to in cl 6.5.2(k)(4)
exist that are
'apposite to the benchmark efficient entity' for any NSW DNSP or ActewAGL (at
[572] and [573]). The effect of this
conclusion is that the trailing average
approach must be applied without a transition for ActewAGL because '...there was
no meaningful,
relevant impact on the benchmark efficient entity apposite for
ActewAGL that could be said to have arisen from the change in methodology
estimating its allowed rate of return. The occasion or need for transition
simply did not exist' (at [573]).
The Court's conclusions about ActewAGL are express and emphatic in their terms.
They apply to the matter before the Tribunal at
present. There is no basis to
distinguish the Court's reasons. It follows that the AER has made a reviewable
error in applying a
trailing average approach with transition, in that it
misconstrued r. 87 of the NGR (which mirrors cl 6.5.2).
made the following submissions:
, the Full Court has adopted a construction of
cl 6.5.2 of the NER whereby, in the case of debt, it is concerned with the
of the entity in question, but measured by reference to an
efficiency yardstick, being the benchmark efficient entity, where different
entities can have different benchmarks: at [529]-[532], [536]-[537], [539],
[543], [571]. At [571], the Full Court observed:
While, for this purpose, the
benchmark efficient entity is a construct, there is nothing in r 6.5.2(c) which
requires one to be oblivious
to the actual circumstances, including the debt
management practices, of the particular service provider whose debt costs are
benchmarked. It is the efficiency of that service provider’s costs
that is to be benchmarked according to what would be required
by the disciplines
of a workably competitive market. Considered against the yardstick of the
efficient financing costs of the benchmark,
the service provider’s debt
management practices will either be efficient or inefficient. Where inefficiency
exists, that inefficiency
should not be reflected in the allowed rate of return
for that service provider. Only efficient financing costs are to be allowed.
The Full Court’s position is therefore consistent
with the position adopted by JEN in its submissions in reply at [54]. As
explained by JEN in the hearing before the Tribunal, the trailing average
approach, for an entity in the position of JEN, has the
benefit of matching the
costs that would be incurred by an efficient business in the position of JEN,
both under existing facilities
and under new facilities as they are taken out
over the regulatory control period. The on-the-day approach does not. As it
the trailing average approach also provides an appropriate signal for
efficient investment for a business in the position of JEN
because it provides
the current rate for new debt, whereas the on-the-day approach does not because
it provides a single rate for
all debt (both existing and new) across the whole
5 year period, and indeed for 10 years (in decreasing weighting) under the
transition.
More generally, the decision of the Full Court is not consistent with a
construction of “efficient financing costs”
in cl 6.5.2 as meaning
“prevailing rates in the market”, or any such combination of
prevailing rates in the market and
costs of the (efficient benchmark) business
as the AER may choose in its discretion.
, the Full Court has adopted a construction of cl 6.5.2(k)(4) of
the NER which is consistent with JEN’s construction, but inconsistent
the AER’s construction: at [560], [570]-[574]. The Full Court concluded
that cl 6.5.2(k)(4) was concerned with impacts
arising from a change of
methodology on a business that had entered into commitments on the basis of the
previous methodology. Thus
the Full Court concluded, at [572]-[573], that in the
case of the Networks NSW businesses, who did not have hedge contracts, and
the case of ActewAGL, which did not have debt, there was no scope for the
application of cl 6.5.2(k)(4) because there were no
“impacts”. As
the Full Court observed at [573], “the occasion or need for a transition
simply did not exist”.
The Full Court therefore adopted the approach to
the construction of cl 6.5.2(k)(4) advanced in JEN’s submissions in chief
at [80]-[85], and rejected the approach advanced in the AER’s submissions
at [61]-[66].
This is significant, because cl 6.5.2(k)(4) was the sole clause that the AER
could point to as providing textual support for considering
wider NPV=0 issues
over the life of the asset (whatever that means). In particular, the Full
Court’s construction of cl 6.5.2(k)(4)
does not support: (a) the
AER’s approach of not permitting a business to recover its efficient debt
costs on the basis that
the perpetuation of a mismatch is consistent with some
broader NPV=0 consideration, or (b) the AER’s approach of considering
effect of changing a methodology on “expectations” at the time of
entry into debt facilities.
The position of JEN is relevantly indistinguishable from the position of
ActewAGL, which was the subject of the conclusion of the
Full Court at [573].
AER made the following submissions (footnotes omitted):
The conclusions of the Full Court in
AER v Australian
Competition Tribunal (No 2)
bear upon, but are not determinative of, the
grounds of review raised by the Applications of Jemena (under the NEL) and
ActewAGL (under
the NGL) with respect to the return on debt topic.
The AER acknowledges that the ultimate conclusion it reached in its Final
Decisions with respect to the return on debt topic for
Jemena and ActewAGL was
materially the same as the conclusion it reached in its Final Decisions for the
NSW/ACT service providers,
the subject of the Tribunal decision in
Interest Advocacy Service and Ausgrid
[2016] ACompT 1
Tribunal decision
) and related decisions and the Full Court’s decision
AER v Australian Competition Tribunal (No 2).
However, the reasoning in the two sets of decisions differs materially. Having
received the adverse decision from the Tribunal in
the NSW/ACT matters, the AER
reconsidered the proper approach to the applicable rules on the return on debt
topic for the Jemena
and ActewAGL Final Decisions, including the economic
considerations relevant to the applicable rules and the AER’s decision,
and explained its reasons for decision in greater depth with reference to the
economic principles that underlie the NER. In the Jemena
and ActewAGL Final
Decisions, the AER considered that the previously applied on-the-day methodology
had provided ex-ante compensation
for efficient financing costs (referred to as
the NPV=0 condition), consistent with the ARORO (and the NEO/NGO and the revenue
pricing principles). The AER concluded that compliance with the ARORO
requires the change of methodology to be implemented in a forward-looking
so that the change was revenue neutral and did not affect the net present value
of the future cash flows of the service providers
through the PTRM (avoiding
windfall gains or losses to the service provider and consumers). That conclusion
was independent of, but
consistent with, the considerations arising under NER cl
6.5.2(k)(4).
As recorded by the Tribunal in the Ausgrid Tribunal Decision, the primary
errors asserted by the service providers on the part of
the AER were adopting
the concept of the benchmark efficient entity as a regulated entity and adopting
a “one size fits all”
benchmark efficient entity for the purposes of
each of its decisions. The Tribunal found that once the step is taken of
with a benchmark efficient entity that has the characteristics of a
participant in a competitive market, the AER’s approach
to transitioning
the return on debt estimate, and the application of clause 6.5.2(k)(4), must be
reconsidered.
AER v Australian Competition Tribunal (No 2),
the Full Court found no
error in those conclusions of the Tribunal. The Full Court concluded that NER cl
6.5.2(c) does not, in terms,
posit the benchmark efficient entity as either a
regulated entity or an unregulated entity, although the degree of risk to be
to the benchmark efficient entity may be affected by the fact that
the service provider’s provision of the relevant services
is regulated.
The Full Court concluded that clause 6.5.2(k)(4) contemplates the possibility
that there may not be a single benchmark
efficient entity; the Full Court also
considered that, in light of the AER’s conceptualisation of efficient
financing costs
of a benchmark efficient entity in its reasons in the NSW/ACT
matters, the AER had not identified any impacts from changing methodologies
would activate clause 6.5.2(k)(4).
The issues for determination in the present matter differ materially from the
issues determined in the Ausgrid Tribunal Decision
AER v Australian
Competition Tribunal (No 2).
That is because the AER’s reasoning for
its conclusion in the Jemena and ActewAGL Final Decisions differed materially
NSW/ACT matters. As a consequence, the Applications for Review of
Jemena and ActewAGL, while worded differently, raise the following
common issues
for determination:
proper construction of the expression “efficient financing costs”
within the allowed rate of return objective in NER
clause 6.5.2(c) and
“efficient costs” within the revenue and pricing principles in s 7A
of the NEL;
economic reasons for using prevailing rates (also referred to as the “on
the day” methodology) in determining a return
on debt (and the cost of
capital more generally) and the economic reasons for changing to a trailing
average methodology;
economic consequences of changing from an “on the day” methodology
to a trailing average methodology and whether the
change, without a forward
looking transition, would conflict with the NPV = 0 condition which underpins
the building block framework
prescribed by the NER;
proper construction of NER cl 6.5.2(k)(4);
the AER was correct to have regard to the difficulties associated with
historical debt data and the potential for bias in
regulatory decision making;
the AER failed to consult with Jemena and ActewAGL with respect to its further
reasoning for its return on debt decision.
The benchmark efficient entity issue
ActewAGL’s Application (but not Jemena’s
Application) raises the issue of the proper characterisation of the benchmark
efficient entity. ActewAGL contends that the AER erred because it characterised
the benchmark efficient entity as a regulated entity,
while it ought to have
characterised it as an unregulated entity.
The AER acknowledges that the effect of the decision in
AER v Australian
Competition Tribunal (No 2)
is that it was incorrect for the AER to
characterise the benchmark efficient entity as regulated. However, that does not
ActewAGL has established a ground of review that would require the
AER’s decision to be set aside. That is for the following
interrelated
, ActewAGL’s ground of review is itself incorrect. The Full
Court did not conclude that the benchmark efficient entity should
characterised as unregulated, as propounded by ActewAGL. Indeed, the Full Court
recognised that the risks of regulation may affect
the degree of risk that the
benchmark efficient entity bears.
, the question whether the benchmark efficient entity is
characterised as regulated or unregulated was not material to the AER’s
Final Decision with respect to ActewAGL (or, for that matter, the other service
providers before the Tribunal in the current matters).
As explained above, the
AER’s decision to adopt a forward-looking transition arose because this
was the only option that it
considered met the ARORO and the NEO/NGO. This
decision did not depend on the conception of the benchmark efficient entity.
The AER specifically considered the character of the benchmark efficient entity
in section H.1.2 of its reasons. In that section,
the AER found that the
relevant benchmark efficient entity was ‘a pure play, regulated energy
network business operating within
Australia’. The AER noted that a debate
had now arisen with the service providers as to whether the benchmark efficient
should be unregulated. The AER found that whether the benchmark efficient
entity was regulated or unregulated made no difference
to its ultimate
conclusion on debt transition:
...even if a benchmark efficient entity
was necessarily unregulated, we do not consider this would affect our
conclusions. Our approach
to the cost of debt would be applicable to an
unregulated firm if it had a similar degree of risk to the service provider in
regulated services. Further, irrespective of whether a firm is
regulated or not, efficient financing costs reflect the current (or
prevailing)
forward looking costs observed in capital markets.
, before granting any relief after a ground of
review is established, the Tribunal must consider the materially preferable test
out in NGL s 259(4a). The Tribunal ought not be satisfied that a materially
preferable NGO decision would be achieved by setting
aside the AER’s
decision and remitting the matter to the AER to take into account the correct
characterisation of the benchmark
efficient entity. Having regard to the
AER’s expressed reasons as extracted in the preceding paragraph, the
Tribunal can be
satisfied that a change in the characterisation of the benchmark
efficient entity would not alter the AER’s decision.
NER cl 6.5.2(k)(4) and NGR cl 87(11)(d)
Both the Jemena and ActewAGL Applications raise as an issue
the proper construction of NER cl 6.5.2(k)(4) and NGR cl 87(11)(d).31
AER v Australian Competition Tribunal (No 2),
the Full Court
considered the manner in which the Tribunal in the NSW/ACT matters had
interpreted NER cl 6.5.2(k)(4) and concluded
that there was no error in the
Tribunal’s approach. However, for the following reasons, the Full
Court’s decision does
not determine the issues raised by Jemena and
ActewAGL, nor the outcome of the “materially preferable test”.
, the Full Court was not required to provide, and did not provide,
an exhaustive analysis of the meaning of clause 6.5.2(k)(4). Its
narrower: to determine whether the Tribunal had erred in its construction of the
clause in the light of the facts and issues
raised before it.
, the Full Court was not required to consider, and did not
consider, the specific issue raised in this matter: whether clause 6.5.2(k)(4)
includes changes to revenue (positive or negative) that arise solely from a
change in methodology and which would deviate (positively
or negatively) from
the recovery of efficient financing costs in accordance with the NPV=0
condition. While this matter was raised
in grounds of review before the Tribunal
in the Ausgrid matter, those grounds were not ultimately addressed by the
Tribunal because
it found error at an earlier point (the characterisation of the
benchmark efficient entity). Accordingly, the issue was not considered
Full Court.
, the AER’s decision to adopt Option 2 (the transition) had
regard to, but did not depend on, NER cl 6.5.2(k)(4) and NGR cl
87(11)(d). As
noted above, the AER based its decision on the ARORO, and considered that that
conclusion was consistent with NER cl
6.5.2(k)(4) and NGR cl 87(11)(d).
The Tribunal’s analysis
requirement of r 6.5.2(h) is to estimate the return on debt for a particular
service provider such that it contributes to the
achievement of the allowed rate
of return objective. First, the Tribunal notes that in estimating the return on
debt, the AER was
faced with:
proposals by the applicants for immediate implementation of an HTA of interest
rates (the initial proposals having been for
a form of transition to that
the fact that in
previous regulatory periods, the on-the-day approach had been applied (and
indeed mandated);
a new (as of
2013) Rule which provides a discretion, without limitation, to choose between
the on-the-day approach, an HTA, or some
combination of the two, subject to
r 6.5.2(h) and via it, r 6.5.2(c).
In short, it had a choice, subject to compliance with r 6.5.2(h), and with
more generally.
AER was thus in the position contemplated by s 16(1)(d) of the
This section was considered by the Full Court, which said (at [159]):
...that provision requires, where there are 2 or more
possible reviewable regulatory decisions that will or are likely to contribute
to the achievement of the national electricity objective, the AER must make the
decision that it is satisfied will or is likely to
contribute to the achievement
of that objective to the greatest degree.
Extrapolating from that requirement, the Tribunal considers that the AER must,
in applying r 6.5.2(h), consider which of a choice
of estimates, or
estimation approaches, would contribute, or be likely to contribute, to the
achievement of the ARORO to the greater
or greatest degree. This has
implications for the manner in which the Tribunal has assessed the
applicants’ claims.
the Tribunal’s view, the applicants’ submissions are best dealt with
in the following categories of claims:
the immediate implementation of the trailing average would (uniquely for the
applicant DNSPs) contribute to the ARORO.
the AER was in error in considering that its transition to a fully implemented
HTA could contribute to the ARORO in the case
of the applicant DNSPs.
the AER could only decide to impose a transition under r 87(11)(d) and was not
in fact empowered to do so by that rule.
the AER’s decision miscarried because of a failure to foreshadow its
change of reasoning.
In respect of Claims 1 and 2, both applicants emphasised that the construction
of “efficient financing costs of the BEE”
was the key issue, and
that on which the AER was in error.
essence of Jemena’s case was that a service provider ought to be
compensated for its efficient debt costs, with efficiency
measured by reference
to a BEE; and that efficient debt costs would be those associated with a
staggered portfolio of debt, refinanced
10 per cent each year. Senior Counsel
for Jemena described debt obligations as costs of the business like other costs
of the business,
and stated that existing businesses have a staggered portfolio
of debt. ActewAGL’s case was presented slightly differently,
starting point being the AER’s wrong construction of “efficient
financing costs” as concerning only interest
rates, whereas they related
to all matters that bear upon the financing costs that the benchmark efficient
entity acting efficiently
would incur during the regulatory period, including
its efficient financing practices. Since the efficient debt portfolio of a
efficient entity, which was not otherwise regulated by a debt
methodology imposed on it by the AER, would be a staggered portfolio
at the commencement of this access arrangement period, then that that is how
ActewAGL’s return on debt should be
Tribunal considers first the construction of “efficient financing
applicants, in their submissions made subsequent to the Full Court’s 2017
decision, relied on statements there regarding
efficient financing costs as set
out above. It is worth setting out a number of the Full Court’s
statements. The following
points are particularly relevant:
In promulgating the 2012 Rule Amendments, the AEMC
considered that the most appropriate benchmark to use in the regulatory
for all service providers was the efficient private sector service
The required benchmarking is with respect to the efficiency of financing and
risk management practices that are to be expected according
to the disciplines
of a workably competitive market. The correct approach to estimating the return
on debt is by reference to the
efficient financing costs of a benchmark
efficient entity, rather than the actual financing costs of the particular
service provider.
Plainly enough, a workably competitive market is not a regulated market.
But, viewing the efficient financing costs of a benchmark
efficient entity as
those that would be incurred in a workably competitive market does not mean
that, for the purposes of construing
and applying the allowed rate of return
objective, the benchmark efficient entity must then be fixed with the character
of an unregulated
The degree of risk by which the efficient financing costs of the benchmark
efficient entity are to be estimated must be similar
to the risks that apply to
the relevant service provider in providing the standard control services. The
allowed rate of return
objective is no more prescriptive than that. The
assessment of that risk is a matter for the AER in the first instance.
“a similar degree of risk” is to be
benchmark efficient entity. That degree of risk may be affected by the fact
that the service provider’s provision of
the relevant services is
regulated. But ... this does not mean that the benchmark efficient entity must
be characterised as a regulated
Thus ... it is not appropriate to characterise the benchmark efficient entity
as either a regulated or an unregulated entity. The
allowed rate of return
objective does not do so, and there is no need to do so. The allowed rate of
return objective confers on
the benchmark its particular, necessary and defining
characteristics: it must be efficient and it must face “a similar degree
of risk” as that which applies to the particular service provider in
question in relation to the provision of standard control
services. But the
attribution of the relevant “efficiency” (i.e., in respect of
financing costs) is to be gauged by
the disciplines of a workably competitive
market (i.e., an unregulated market).
If one service provider’s risk was different to another service
provider’s risk, ... the benchmark efficient entity
for the first service
provider could not be the benchmark efficient entity for the second service
provider because different degrees
of risk would need to be attributed to the
benchmarks appropriate to those service providers.... [T]here will not be an
benchmark efficient entity for all service providers.... Indeed, the
statement of the allowed rate of return objective in r 6.5.2(c)
contemplates, at
least, the possibility of different benchmark efficient entities, as does
r 6.5.2(k)(4).
In the context of a consideration of r 6.5.2(k)(4): ...[T]he undoubted
function of r 6.5.2(c) is to provide ... an “efficiency
for the particular costs under consideration. This was plainly the AEMC’s
intention in the 2012 Rule Determination.
While, for this purpose, the
benchmark efficient entity is a construct, there is nothing in r 6.5.2(c)
which requires one to be
oblivious to the actual circumstances, including the
debt management practices, of the particular service provider whose debt costs
are being benchmarked. It is the efficiency of that service provider’s
costs that is to be benchmarked according to what would
be required by the
disciplines of a workably competitive market. Considered against the yardstick
of the efficient financing costs
of the benchmark, the service provider’s
debt management practices will either be efficient or inefficient. Where
inefficiency
exists, that inefficiency should not be reflected in the allowed
rate of return for that service provider. Only efficient financing
costs are to
be allowed. But none of this means that, in applying r 6.5.2(c) to estimate the
return on debt under r 6.5.2(h), and
in considering whether impacts of the kind
referred to in r 6.5.2(k)(4) exist that should be taken into account for
that purpose,
fictions should be imposed when the service provider has, for
example, already implemented a debt structure that satisfies a required
of the intended benchmark efficiency.
applicants put particular weight on the last of those passages. The Tribunal
notes that it is essential to read the Full Court’s
reasons in the context
of the questions it was considering. Those questions were: whether the
Tribunal erred in law in concluding
that the AER was bound to address the RoR
Objective on the basis that the benchmark efficient entity must be an
unregulated entity;
and whether the Tribunal erred in its construction of r
6.5.2(k)(4) of the
. However, the question immediately facing this
Tribunal is the construction of “efficient financing costs” for the
of giving effect to r 6.5.2(b) and r 6.5.2(h). While the
passage above deals with the application of r 6.5.2(h), it does so in the
context of construing r 6.5.2(k)(4).
making that point, the Tribunal does not seek to distinguish the words of the
Full Court in any of the passages quoted above. Indeed,
they have been quoted
because of their relevance. But it also considers that the construction of
“efficient financing costs”
needs to be considered in the context of
what is required by r 6.5.2 as a whole, in the context of the NEO and the
NGO, and in the
light of the specific claims by the applicants about how the
return on debt should be estimated.
is true that among the attributes of debt costs is that they constitute
obligations to make payments, and in that regard are similar
in many ways to
other obligations to meet costs of doing business, such as paying wages and
salaries, and other components of operating
expenditure (opex). But the
regulatory scheme treats debt very differently.
there is no building block for debt. It is not included in opex, and there is
no explicit, separate allowance (in dollar terms)
for the cost of debt. Rather,
there is a building block for return on capital. The return on capital
implicitly – through the
manner in which it is estimated – contains
components for a return on equity and a return on debt. But the return on
is not calculated separately for equity and debt. The return on capital
(in dollar terms) is found by multiplying the rate of return
(on capital) by the
regulatory asset base (electricity) or the projected capital base (gas).
the economic theory on which the regulatory scheme is based, the rate of return
on an investment depends on the risk characteristics
of that investment. It is a
required rate of return: required
by the investor. It is also
called the cost of capital. Perhaps counter-intuitively, the cost of capital is
not determined by the
financial cost of raising debt and equity, but by the risk
of the investment. That is because, as usually in economics, it is an
opportunity cost. The question is how it can best be estimated.
with so much of the regulatory framework governing the rate of return, there is
a large body of economic theory underlying the
Rules. That economic theory is
broadly accepted by all the stakeholders, but there is disagreement about some
of the details, and
in particular how the theory should be applied. It is
entirely uncontroversial in conventional economics that the required rate of
return on an investment is determined by the risk of the investment. Under the
usual, generally-accepted, assumptions, in a workably
competitive market that
rate of return will be just sufficient to give the investment’s stream of
cash flows a net present
value of zero.
concept. That is, the expectation of the investor at the
time of making the investment is that the positive cash flows, discounted
required rate of return, will equal the cost of the investment. Obviously,
investors will seek an NPV higher than zero, but
competition will prevent that
occurring. So the theory goes.
is no leap to consider that a company’s required rate of return is
determined by the risk of its investments, i.e of its
assets, and can be
regarded similarly. All sorts of things might change after the investment is
made. It is the possibility of different
outcomes that gives rise to the risk in
the first place. The investment might turn out better or worse than expected. Of
in normal circumstances, the debt-holders will expect to get paid, and
the equity-holders bear the risk, but debt also has its risks.
the required rate of return is independent of the financing of the investment
or, in the case of a firm’s assets,
of its capital structure. That is, the
required rate of return depends on the risk characteristics of the firm’s
assets, not
on the nature of its liabilities (debt and equity).
is that required rate of return to be estimated? More specifically, how is the
required rate of return for a regulated electricity
or gas service provider to
be estimated? Broadly, the idea – again uncontroversial – is that
the regulator seeks to estimate
the required rate of return (or cost of capital)
of a company that has a similar degree of risk to the regulated company but is
in a workably competitive market. That (opportunity) cost of capital
will be efficient in the economic sense, which goes beyond the
“with a minimum of waste”. It will lead to the regulated company
charging prices for its services that promote
efficient investment in, and
efficient operation and use of electricity and gas services for the long-term
interests of consumers.
That is, the required rate of return, properly
estimated, will serve the NEO or NGO.
Rules, as now amended, guide the regulator towards the estimate of the required
rate of return through the ARORO. It is obvious,
then, that the phrase
“efficient financing costs” must be construed consistently with the
efficiency thrust of the NEO
and NGO, ie in terms of the accepted notions of
economic efficiency.
allowed rate of return has two components: the return on equity and the return
on debt. The allowed rate of return is to be determined
such that it
the ARORO. The components of the allowed rate of return cannot
individually achieve the ARORO. They are to be determined so as to
to the achievement of the ARORO. Achievement of the ARORO
consists of the rate of return being commensurate with the efficient financing
costs of the BEE.
the Rules, “return on equity” and “return on debt” are
rates, ie percentages. The allowed return on equity
and return on debt in dollar
terms are never calculated. Instead, the estimated rate of return on equity and
rate of return on debt
are averaged using equity and debt weights to generate
the estimate of the overall rate of return on capital, also known as the
average cost of capital. Of course, arithmetically, one could instead
calculate the dollar allowed return on equity, apply the appropriate
it, and add it to the weighted dollar allowed return on debt. The fact that the
Rules do not take that approach reflects
the underlying theory.
rate of return on capital has primacy. The use of the rates of return on equity
and debt is a means to the end of estimating that
overall rate of return, and to
then determining the return on capital building block. From its total allowed
revenue, the service
provider must meet its debt obligations along with its
opex, capex and other expenditures. The Rules are careful not to imply that
there is a guaranteed return to the shareholders. They get what is left. If the
service provider can operate more efficiently than
expected – including no
less in its debt management than its management of opex, for example – the
shareholders may receive
a higher rate of return than was expected in the
forward-looking framework.
is reflected in the fact that the ARORO relates to the overall rate of return
– the rate of return is to achieve the ARORO
– while the rate of
return on debt and the rate of return on equity are to be determined so as to
contribute to the achievement
of the ARORO. At this point a stark difference
might be noted in the degree of prescription in the Rules for estimating the
on equity compared to the return on debt. The return on equity is to be
estimated such that it contributes to the ARORO, and in making
the estimate
regard must be had to the prevailing conditions in the market for equity funds.
That is the sum of the guidance given.
By contrast, the approach to the
estimation of the return on debt is prescribed in far more detail, as has been
set out above.
yet in each case it is the ARORO to which reference is made to govern the
estimation. It can be seen that the ARORO has a lot
of work to do in the case of
the return on equity. The AER has very wide discretion in deciding on an
approach. In fact, the practice
is to apply the Capital Asset Pricing Model
), as explained in the RoR Guideline, which spends considerably more
space explaining the return on equity than the return on debt.
The CAPM is a
highly simplified and elegant framework embedded in a broader finance theory
that assumes that an investor holds a
fully diversified portfolio and abstracts
greatly from the day-to-day realities of equity markets (such as transactions
costs). This
framework is consistent with the forward-looking rate of return.
add that the use of the word “commensurate” in the ARORO might be
regarded as an acknowledgement that the efficient
financing costs of a BEE are
not something that can be estimated with precision. The injunction to achieve
the ARORO, while unequivocal,
has an unavoidably aspirational aspect to it. The
determinations of the returns on equity and debt are, equally unavoidably, at a
remove from the achievement of the ARORO; hence the requirement that their
determination “contribute”.
or not the Rule acknowledges an imprecision in the task facing the regulator, it
is certainly the case that practitioners
would never claim that a required rate
of return can be estimated with precision.
point of mentioning the return on equity is to note that in construing the
ARORO, and in particular “efficient financing
costs of a BEE with a
similar degree of risk as that which applies to the DNSP”, it is clear
that all the constituent terms,
and indeed individual words, are redolent with
the economic theory – generally accepted by stakeholders – of the
investment framework given effect to by the Rules. Ultimately that
framework is employed in the regulatory scheme to serve the NEO
and the NGO for
the long-term interests of consumers. Those objectives embody notions of
productive, allocative and dynamic efficiency.
It would be a mistake to think of
efficient costs in the context of return on debt purely in terms of efficient
debt management practices.
The broader objectives need to be kept in mind.
Tribunal sees no tension between this view and the statements by the Full Court,
set out at [102] above. In particular, the term
“efficient financing
costs” embodies the
, forward-looking, expectations-based
framework briefly described above. This does not seem to be in contention when
expressed in
those broad terms.
question arises whether the term “efficient financing costs of a
BEE” needs to be interpreted differently in estimating
the return on debt
from how it is interpreted in determining the return on equity. In the case of
the return on debt, the AER has
a somewhat narrower discretion. The Rules give
more guidance than in the case of the return on equity. Nevertheless, the
is still considerable. In particular, although attention is given to
the time at which a BEE raises debt – at the time of
or shortly before the
making of the determination, or over a historical period prior to the
commencement of a regulatory year, or
a combination – that Rule is
expressed in non-mandatory terms (“the methodology may be
designed...”) and is without
relevant limitation.
Tribunal concludes that “the efficient financing costs of a BEE” has
the same meaning whether applied to the estimation
of the return on equity or
the return on debt, and should not be seen as carrying deeper or more specific
implications in one case
than the other. However, there is no avoiding the fact
that estimating the return on debt is a very different process from estimating
the return on equity. We shall return to what the AEMC had to say about that
difference.
that background, we turn to the four claims by the applicants.
Claim 1: The immediate implementation of the trailing average
approach would contribute to the achievement of the ARORO
were several assertions of what was common ground between the parties. The
Tribunal can only be confident that all parties seem
to agree that it is a
reasonable assumption that a BEE for either of the applicants would, in due
course, ten years after implementation
of the HTA approach (either immediately
or with a transition), hold a staggered portfolio of debt, refinanced 10 per
cent each year.
Clearly the AER does not accept that the BEE would already, at
the start of the regulatory period to which its Final Decisions apply,
a staggered portfolio in place. The applicants assert that the BEE in their
cases would. Jemena concedes that the BEE for
another firm, such as a new
entrant, might not have a staggered portfolio in place.
Effectively
the claim is that a BEE for Jemena or ActewAGL would have adopted that financing
practice ten years ago (or earlier) because
it is the efficient debt management
practice in a workably competitive market.
Tribunal has a number of concerns. The first is that it cannot be said that
efficient debt management practice of any particular BEE
to have had in place a staggered portfolio of fixed-rate ten-year debt
(although reference was made to the apparent acceptance by
the Tribunal of that
proposition in
at [865]). Given the vast array of financing
options in modern capital markets, it would be heroic indeed to try to specify
the debt financing arrangements of a BEE would look like. In fact, neither
Jemena nor ActewAGL has any debt; both are 100 per cent
equity-financed. That is
itself indicative of the range of efficient actual debt management practices
available. Many strategies
are used in workably competitive markets to raise
debt including, indeed, hybrids of debt and equity.
is unclear what debt management practices a BEE with similar risk to the
applicant service providers would adopt. The only characteristic
that the Rules
specify for the BEE is that it have similar risk to the company for which it is
the benchmark (specifically, risk
in respect of the provision of reference
services). No evidence was presented to suggest that this degree of risk is
uniquely associated
with – or in any way associated with – the fact
that the company was not a new entrant but had been operating under the
regulatory regime for some years. Yet this was the only characteristic proposed
as making it almost self-evident that the BEE would
have a staggered portfolio
of debt. To emphasise the point: the BEE is not to be supposed to ape the
characteristics of the company
for which it is the benchmark in extraneous
respects such as debt management arrangements. It is only risk that is germane.
is all the more clear when the BEE is specific to a company that has no
debt, as in the case here.
fact, no persuasive evidence was adduced that staggered debt portfolios are the
norm for firms with any particular risk characteristics
in a workably
competitive market.
AEMC did not make the 2012 Rule Amendments because there was evidence that in a
workably competitive market firms adopt a staggered
portfolio of ten-year
fixed-rate debt. Rather its concern was that an efficient debt management
practice for DNSPs might be to manage
debt in that way, and that the on-the-day
approach was preventing or discouraging it; and that the on-the day approach was
inefficient debt-management practices on some service providers.
2012 Rule Amendments should be seen not as changing the method of estimating the
cost of debt so as to be in accord with a debt
management practice that had been
in place for ten years, but as removing an impediment to that practice where it
was efficient.
Importantly, the Rule change did not mandate the new approach
but allowed it, without limitation, as a regulatory option along with
on-the-day approach or a combination of the two. That is very far from making a
finding, or adopting a fiction, that a BEE would
have had a staggered portfolio
of debt in place for ten years.
more than that, the Tribunal does not consider that the ARORO can be interpreted
such that the term “efficient financing
costs” should generate and
govern a search for supposedly superior actual debt management practices in the
market. Such a search
would have to consider the risk/return trade-off in
various debt instruments. As the Full Court made clear, a BEE is a construct
which, while specific to a given DNSP, is simply a means to the end of judging
whether financing costs are efficient. And that exercise
is undertaken to assess
whether the overall rate of return on capital is commensurate with efficient
financing costs.
is consistent with the AEMC’s statements:
The final rule provides the regulator with sufficient
discretion on the methodology for estimating the required return on equity and
debt components but also requires the consideration of a range of estimation
methods, financial models, market data and other information
so that the best
estimate of the rate of return can be obtained overall that achieves the allowed
rate of return objective.
...the return on debt estimate should reflect the
efficient financing costs of a benchmark efficient service provider. It should
to create an incentive for service providers to adopt efficient financing
practices and minimise the risks of creating distortions
in the service
providers’ investment decisions.
... the new rules allow the regulator (and the appeal
body) to focus on whether the overall rate of return meets the allowed rate
return objective, which is intended to be consistent with the NEO, the NGO and
There is no hint that the AEMC considered that there was a single right answer
to estimating the return on debt, or a range of single
right answers for
different service providers. Rather, its whole emphasis was on giving the AER a
discretion and a guiding light.
HTA approach is consistent with an assumption that the BEE has refinanced, and
will continue to refinance, one-tenth of its debt
each year. This is a
simplifying assumption. It is far from a finding that the efficient financing
costs of a BEE would in fact involve
such a debt structure and debt instruments.
That is asking too much of the ARORO and the concept of efficient financing
objective is more modest. It is not to specify efficient debt
management practices but, by reference to a workably competitive market,
ascertain whether the return on capital (overall) is commensurate with efficient
financing costs. As part of that, it is to have
the return on debt contribute to
that exercise.
the case of Jemena and ActewAGL there is little difficulty in accepting the
artificial construct of a BEE that would have refinanced
the whole of its debt
at the start of the regulatory period because that would be efficient given the
risk attributed to it, being
a similar degree of risk as applying to the
relevant DNSP in the provision of standard control services, and noting the Full
comment that the degree of risk may be affected by the fact that
the service provider’s provision of the relevant services
is regulated. To
see this, we need to consider what is involved in such an attribution of degree
of risk. Little was said about this
in submissions to the Tribunal, so the
Tribunal will not attempt a definitive analysis.
it is conventional that a firm’s risk relates to the variability of the
cash flows generated by its assets. In the
case of a firm regulated under the
Rules, its cash flows are partly determined as allowable revenue. Under the
on-the-day approach,
a firm that is able to borrow at around the time its
allowed revenue is set is guaranteed revenue – a cash flow that is less
variable than in a workably competitive market – that includes a component
very close to what is needed to just cover its actual
(not opportunity)
borrowing costs. For such a firm, the BEE with a similar degree of risk could
thus reasonably be constructed as
one that borrows “on the
is not to characterise the BEE as a regulated entity. It is simply to examine
how to attribute the similar degree of risk to
applicants argue that firms in their circumstances could not adopt that
approach. But since they do not borrow at all, it is hard
to see why the
construct should be considered out of court. In any case, a BEE for either of
them would have had the risk characteristics
of a service provider whose allowed
revenue included a return on its capital base calculated, in part, on a return
on debt estimated
by the on-the-day approach. It is not clear to the Tribunal
why one should assume that such a BEE would have had a staggered portfolio
place over the last ten years.
the extent that ActewAGL’s argument rested on the assumption that the BEE
is an unregulated entity, which it considered to
have been the Tribunal’s
position in
that argument must be rejected in the light of the
Full Court’s decision that the BEE is neither regulated nor unregulated,
Tribunal therefore does not accept that the immediate implementation of the HTA
necessarily
contribute to the achievement of the ARORO in the case
of Jemena or ActewAGL.
far we have passed over the objection that the AER’s analysis is
necessarily in error because it took the BEE to be a regulated
entity, contrary
to the subsequent findings of the Full Court. We note that in its Final
Decisions the AER stated that its approach
to the cost of debt would be
applicable to an unregulated firm if it had a similar degree of risk to the
service provider in providing
regulated services; and that irrespective of
whether a firm is regulated or not, efficient financing costs reflect the
current (or
prevailing) forward looking costs observed in capital markets. We
accept the AER’s approach to be consistent with what we have
discussion of the relationship between forward-looking
costs and prevailing
market conditions is presented later in these reasons.
come now to the AER’s conclusion that immediate implementation of the HTA
would not contribute to the achievement of the
ARORO. That conclusion was based
on the fact that the current market cost of debt is considerably below the
average over the last
nine years. Implementing the HTA immediately would, in the
AER’s view, provide a rate of return higher than needed to compensate
applicants for their efficient financing costs.
Tribunal considers that unless the applicants did have legacy debt as described
– and they did not – it is indisputable
that providing a return on
debt partially based on the much higher interest rates of some years ago would
give the applicants a windfall
gain. This would be inefficient. The allowed
revenue would be higher than needed to cover their costs. They do not have debt
at the higher legacy interest rates, or any debt. There is no need
– and it would be inappropriate – to adopt a fiction
would have had such debt obligations. Nothing in the ARORO could support an
outcome so starkly at odds with the long term
interests of consumers. It would
simply be a transfer from consumers to the service providers. And the Full Court
said, at [571]:
“... there is nothing in r 6.5.2(c) which requires
one to be oblivious to the actual circumstances, including the debt management
practices, of the particular service provider whose debt costs are being
benchmarked.”
applicants submitted that the Full Court’s reasons do not contemplate an
assessment of the efficient financing costs over
multiple past and future
regulatory periods, and that this invalidates the AER’s reasoning in
respect of windfall gains (and
the use of the NPV = 0 analysis). The
Tribunal considers that the Full Court’s reasons in respect of the
construction of r
6.5.2(k)(4) are not relevant to that part of the
AER’s reasoning.
AER also considered that, had the trend in interest rates been up rather than
down, immediate implementation of the HTA would
under-compensate the service
providers, and the Tribunal agrees. It cannot be doubted that no service
provider would in those circumstances
propose an immediate implementation of the
HTA. The Tribunal considers it a relevant consideration whether an approach to
the return on debt is neutral with respect to past interest rates.
Claim 2: The AER was in error in considering that its
transition to a full trailing average (TTA) could contribute to the
AER concluded that its phased implementation of the HTA could contribute to
achievement of the ARORO. Both applicants argue that
it is a step in the
AER’s reasoning to that conclusion that the on-the-day approach could
contribute to achievement of the
ARORO, and that it could not. Hence, the AER
was in error. Embedded in these claims is a dispute about the prevailing cost of
applicants claim that the AER had incorrectly equated the concept of efficient
financing costs in the ARORO with prevailing debt
interest rates, ignoring other
factors that influence the financing decisions of a BEE. For instance, the AER
stated (ActewAGL Final
Decision at page 3-17):
A key concept in the ARORO is ‘efficient financing
costs’. Because the market for capital finance is competitive, a benchmark
efficient entity is expected to face competitive prices in the market for funds.
Therefore, we consider efficient financing costs
are reflected in the prevailing
market cost of capital (or WACC) for an investment with a similar degree of risk
as that which applies
to a service provider in respect of the provision of
regulated services.
reaching this conclusion the AER relied upon the advice of Partington and
Report to the AER: Discussion of the allowed cost of debt
Partington and Satchell
)). In particular, Partington and
Satchell stated that the WACC should be calculated on the basis of prevailing
interest rates:
The theory of finance (and common practice) is that in
computing the weighted average cost of capital for use in NPV calculations
the current required returns on debt and equity that should be used for the
WACC. Thus with respect to the cost of debt it
is the current cost of debt (as
currently required in the market) that should be used in the WACC, not the
historic cost of debt.
(Partington and Satchell, page
AER summarised this and other advice in that report and consequently
(Partington and Satchell) interpret efficient financing
costs as the opportunity cost of capital, which is a market rate of return
assets with a given level of risk. They advise the opportunity cost of debt is
generally measured using the (appropriately benchmarked)
yield to maturity.
They also consider our use of a benchmark BBB+ credit rating and ten year term
is appropriate.
We consider that productive, allocative and dynamic efficiency are advanced by
employing a return on debt that reflects prevailing
rates in the market for
funds. This will also promote the long term interests of consumers in line with
the National Electricity
Objective/National Gas Objective (NEO/NGO). (ActewAGL
Final Decision p.3-279, footnotes excluded)
similar conclusion was included in the Jemena Final Decision, at page
was dispute over when the rates were or are “prevailing”, with it
even being asserted that the AER never said when
they were prevailing. The
Tribunal considers it clear that Partington and Satchell are referring to rates
in existence at each point
in time. At any given point in time, those are the
rates that should be used. This is not only consistent with the plain meaning
“prevailing” and the passages above (“current required
returns”) but is also consistent with – and
the only interpretation
that is consistent with – the forward-looking nature of the cost of
capital, remembering that it is
an opportunity cost.
Consequently,
the Tribunal concludes that the AER’s statement in the Final Decisions
that “we consider efficient financing
costs are reflected in the
prevailing market” does not constitute an error as the applicants claim.
The question is what guidance
that provides for estimating a return on debt for
incorporation in the rate of return on capital, given that market interest rates
fluctuate, and how the AER applied the principle of a current required rate of
return. That is the essence of the dispute about the
condition. The problems with the on-the-day approach that motivated the
legislative changes arise largely from its use of
the rate prevailing at the
start of the regulatory period rather than at each point of time during the
regulatory period.
noted previously, the AER took the view that the return on debt must satisfy a
zero NPV condition that does not appear explicitly
). It states that:
... we consider a rate of return that meets the ARORO
must provide ex-ante compensation for efficient financing costs. This return
would give a benchmark efficient entity a reasonable opportunity to recover at
least its efficient financing costs. This is a zero
net present value (NPV)
investment condition ... (ActewAGL Final Decision page 3-16; Jemena Final
Decision page 3-18).
Tribunal agrees that, as expressed above, the zero NPV condition is consistent
with the NGO and RPP and considers that, consistent
with achievement of the
ARORO, it represents a criterion that should be satisfied, to the greatest
degree practicable, by the approach
used to assess the rate of return (cost of
capital) and the returns on equity and debt. The AER then considered the zero
NPV investment
condition by reference to Partington and Satchell:
The zero NPV investment criterion has two important
properties. First, a zero NPV investment means that the ex-ante expectation is
that over the life of the investment the expected cash flow from the investment
meets all the operating expenditure and corporate
taxes, repays the capital
invested and there is just enough cash flow left over to cover investors’
required return on the
capital invested. Second, by definition a zero NPV
investment is expected to generate no economic rents. Thus, ex-ante no economic
rents are expected to be extracted as a consequence of market power. The
incentive for investment is just right, encouraging neither
too much investment,
nor too little. (Partington and Satchell, p.14).
into a property of the revenue allowance for a regulated service provider, this
condition also restates the cost recovery
requirements in the RPP, although
limited to a specific investment over its life span. It would require that a
regulated entity be
allowed a stream of revenues over the life of the asset
that, at the time the investment is made, have a net present value, measured
the prevailing WACC, equal to the cost of the asset.
Tribunal considers that to be entirely conventional economic thinking in perfect
accord with the Rules and is potentially a test
that the AER could use, together
with the other criteria specified in the
, to establish its choice
between approaches. We disagree with the applicants that the AER elevated the
criterion above the Rules.
this stage we need to summarise. The objective is to implement the requirement
that the ARORO be achieved by the determination
of the allowed rate of return.
That requirement comes from a view that the outcomes in workably competitive
markets are to be emulated
by reference to the efficient financing costs of a
benchmark efficient entity for the service provider in question. The
conventional
view (which the Tribunal accepts) is that that involves a
forward-looking cost of capital, which in turn implies the use of prevailing,
current, rates in the market; and that that in turn implies an NPV = 0
test. And all that comes back to use of the prevailing
cost of capital leading
to prices and revenues that provide the right incentives for the BEE to invest
efficiently and for its services
to be used efficiently, as they would be in a
workably competitive market.
this is about the BEE, not the service provider. The service provider is not
free to make investment decisions based on its WACC.
Rather, the Rules govern in
detail what capital expenditure is allowed to be added to the capital base and
thus generate revenue
– as part of the return on the capital base building
block – at the allowed rate of return. (The Rules relating to capital
expenditure differ between the electricity and gas regulatory regimes.)
bears reiterating that this whole process is targeted on making a
forward-looking estimate of the overall rate of return. Thinking
in terms of an
allowance for debt is likely to lead to error, especially if the allowance is
thought of as compensation for borrowing
costs incurred in the past at interest
rates then prevailing.
applicants argued that their proposal was superior to the on-the-day approach
because it updated one-tenth of the return on debt
to the rate prevailing at the
start of each regulatory year. But the transition to the HTA decided upon by the
AER has this same
property. The idea seems to be that new investment decisions
during the regulatory period are given the correct signal because they
assumption, be funded by the one-tenth of total debt that is assumed to be
borrowed in that year at the rate prevailing
at the start of that year.
it is said that the rate of return that the firm has regard to in considering
new investment is not its WACC, but the one-tenth
of its WACC that is based on
the latest debt interest rate. (In fact the argument was generally put ignoring
that it is the rate
of return that is relevant to investment decisions, not the
return on debt, as if the investment were fully debt financed. Perhaps
even assumed that the new investment is fully financed by debt.)
Tribunal sees no support for that proposition in the economic theory of
investment, and it is contrary to the advice from SFG
Consulting, with which the
Tribunal agrees, to the AEMC, which is discussed below. The proposition is part
of a view that the return
on debt can and should provide an allowance to
compensate for past borrowings and simultaneously provide the signal for
new investment decisions. Indeed, it was claimed that there was no
tension between those aims. The Tribunal disagrees. It is a misunderstanding
the role of the opportunity cost of capital.
question arises: if the rate of return on capital is a forward-looking concept,
how can historical interest rates on debt figure
in the estimation of the return
on debt, which requires prevailing rates? That question can equally be asked of
the HTA and the on-the-day
approach, because each incorporates past interest
rates rather than current interest rates, at least as the regulatory period
progresses.
(For example, by the second year, in the on-the day-approach the
rate used is “out of date”.) The answer, so it appears
Tribunal, is that adherence to the prevailing rate principle cannot be achieved
in practice, and nor can full consistency
be achieved between the estimation of
the return on equity and the return on debt.
issue is set out starkly in the report to the AEMC by SFG Consulting at the time
of the Rule change proposals:
The rule change ... that the cost of debt allowed by the regulator should
reflect interest costs on debt issued prior to the regulatory
period ... would
represent a fundamental change to the principles which underpin the regulated
rate of return. It would also embed
a clear inconsistency between the principles
which underpin the cost of debt and equity components of the regulated rates of
Specifically, the cost of equity component would reflect the return
equity holders require to encourage them to commit to a new project
today; while
the cost of debt component would reflect the return debt holders required to
entice them to commit funds in a prior
all likelihood, the historical indexing approach ... will produce cost of debt
estimates which exhibit lower variation over time
from one determination to the
next. If this time-series stability promotes a regulatory objective then it
should be considered. However,
it should also be made clear that this
computation does not represent an estimate of the prevailing cost of funds at
the time of
the determination.
short, the regulated rate of return will not be an estimate of the cost of
capital. The principle which underpins the regulatory
framework in Australia is
to estimate a price which equates the present value of expected cash flows to
the regulated asset base.
If the regulated rate of return is set at a rate other
than the cost of capital this will no longer hold.
strong view is not reflected in the AEMC’s Rule Determination, where the
dilemmas involved are discussed to a degree, but
not entirely satisfactorily.
The AEMC said, at page 44, in relation to the rate of return on
It was determined that a robust and effective rate of
return framework must be capable of responding to changes in market conditions.
If the allowed rate of return is not determined with regard to the prevailing
market conditions, it will either be above or below
the return that is required
by capital market investors at the time of the determination. The commission was
of the view that neither
of these outcomes is efficient, nor in the long-term
interests of energy consumers.
dealing with the question of consistency between the estimation of the return on
equity and the return on debt, at page 64,
If a historical average is used to estimate the
allowance for the return on debt, there is no requirement for the resulting
or any part of it, to constrain the estimate of the allowance for the
required return on equity. The return on equity must reflect
the prevailing
conditions in the market as it is a forward-looking financial concept. The
estimation of an historical average is
a different exercise altogether, and one
estimate does not constrain the other.
The final rule also requires that the return on equity estimation to have regard
to the prevailing conditions in the market for equity
funds. There is no
corresponding requirement on the allowance for the return on debt, since the
final rule (and the draft rule) allows
the return on debt to be estimated with
reference to an historical average as well to the prevailing conditions in the
The final rule makes clear the desirability of using an approach that leads to
the consistent application of any estimates of financial
parameters that are
relevant to the estimates of, and that are common to, the return on equity and
the return on debt.
The Commission has decided not to reference
“prevailing conditions in the market for funds” in the overall rate
objective. This is because the objective would then be in conflict
with the allowance for the return of debt where it is estimated
on a trailing
average basis. The Commission considers that it is clear from the return on
equity provisions that the “prevailing
conditions” concept continues
to apply there, and that it also does apply, to the extent possible, for the
return on debt estimation.
and, at page 66:
Also, references to “prevailing conditions” are not meant to exclude
from any consideration historical or realised returns.
However, the Commission
does not consider that any drafting changes to the draft rule are required for
the final rule to give effect
to this. The final rule (as with the draft rule)
is drafted in sufficiently broad terms to allow for such financial concepts to
taken into account for the purposes of developing appropriate estimation
methodologies.
seems to the Tribunal that there is a tension between the AEMC’s concerns
first, if the
overall allowed rate of return is not determined with regard to the prevailing
market conditions then inefficient outcomes
not in the long term interests of
consumers would ensue; and secondly
the return on
equity must reflect prevailing conditions in the market as it is a
forward-looking concept; and thirdly
the estimation
of the return on debt might not recognise prevailing conditions, and (therefore)
could not be allowed to constrain
the estimation of the return on equity; and
“prevailing conditions” concept continues to apply to the overall
rate of return but could not be specified because
there would then be a conflict
with the estimation of the return on debt; and finally
nevertheless the
“prevailing conditions” concept does apply, to the extent possible,
to the return on debt estimation.
The final passage quoted above deals with a different issue: the fact that
making an estimate that reflects prevailing conditions
may require the use
historical data. That is certainly the case in estimating the return on equity.
The situation in respect of the
estimation of the return on debt is different.
Current interest rates are set by competitive interactions between borrowers and
in the market. There is no need to have reference to past interest
rates. In short, interest rates can be directly observed; the
return on equity
passage “the ‘prevailing conditions’ concept ... does apply,
to the extent possible, for the return on debt
estimation” is telling. In
the Tribunal’s view it properly reflects the fact that use of the HTA
approach represents
a departure from forward-looking rates of return, as set out
in the SFG Consulting report. That approach was made possible by the
changes as an option to overcome difficulties with the application of the
on-the-day approach, at least to some service providers.
And as noted above by
the Tribunal, the on-the-day approach also represents a far less than perfect
application of the forward-looking
concept, even where it can be implemented by
a service provider with minimal difficulty through the use of capital market
instruments.
comments are consistent with those of the Tribunal in
Efficient investment and the regulatory approach
to debt costs
NER cl 6.5.2.(k)(3) requires that in setting the cost of debt consideration be
given to “the incentives that the return on
debt may provide in relation
to capital expenditure over the regulatory control period, including as to the
timing of any capital
expenditure”. While the historical trailing average
approach is more compatible with actual debt management practices, it
thought to be less consistent with determination of a cost of capital, and
allowable revenue and prices, required for efficient
investment decisions.
this stage we remind ourselves why the HTA was introduced into the Rules as an
option to be considered by the AER: to provide a
smoother price path over the
long run, across regulatory periods, possibly to reduce service providers’
risk, and because it
received broad stakeholder support. It was not introduced
because the AEMC considered that, in the normal case, it can be assured
representing the efficient financing costs of a BEE with similar risk, as the
applicants claim. The departure from even the imperfect
reliance on prevailing
conditions embodied in the on-the-day approach needs to be kept in mind.
Furthermore,
the AEMC placed weight on advice from SFG Consulting that:
For a given benchmark (in particular, the assumed credit
rating and term to maturity), whether the regulatory allowance is based on
spot rate or an average of that spot rate over time, the average cost of debt
will be the same over the long run. That is, changing
to an averaging approach
will not, in itself, systematically reduce the allowed return on
and further:
Given a particular benchmark for the cost of debt, the
long-run average regulatory allowance for the cost of debt will be the same
regardless of which method is adopted in the Rules. This means that, over time,
consumers will pay the same amount to provide a return
to debt holders
regardless of which approach is adopted in the Rules;
The Tribunal interprets those passages to mean that if the on-the-day approach
were to be applied permanently, or the HTA were applied
permanently, the average
rate of return on debt would be the same in the long term. As we observed above
(also quoting from an SFG
report to the AEMC), the HTA would not, when
incorporated in the WACC, provide an estimate of the opportunity cost of
capital; and
the on-the-day estimate would only be consistent with an
opportunity cost of capital at the start of the regulatory period. Nor are
comments relevant to the issue of a transition.
turn now to how the AER applied the NPV = 0 criterion. The key issue is as
follows. The NPV = 0 criterion relates to the overall
rate of return
on capital. What can be deduced from it for the return on debt?
AER relied in its Final Decisions on a mathematical analysis to show, it
claimed, that the on-the-day approach and its transition
to an HTA for the
return on debt satisfy the NPV = 0 criterion, while immediate
implementation of the HTA does not. This is in Attachment
H. The applicants did
not refer in detail to Attachment H. Rather, their attack was mounted at a
level that did not require an assessment
of the actual mathematical formulation.
The AER followed the same approach in defending its conclusions. We largely take
approach in the following discussion, although we have considered it
desirable to examine Attachment H in detail.
even applying the NPV = 0 criterion using the overall rate of return
presents difficulties. The RAB of a BEE will comprise
a large number of assets
of different values, ages and remaining operating lives, and will change in
value and composition over time.
Applying the Partington and Satchell zero NPV
investment condition to those assets individually would suggest a stream of
based on all the initial valuations and prevailing rates at their time
of acquisition. The aggregate revenue allowance for a return
on capital building
block implied by that stream could not be precisely implemented within the Rules
because the framework requires
a single rate of return to be applied each year
to a separately defined RAB. Immediately, some approximation is
inevitable.
AER’s mathematical analysis of the zero NPV condition treated the RAB as
if it was a single asset, as set out in the following
We consider a rate of return that meets the ARORO must
provide ex-ante compensation for efficient financing costs (we refer to this
ex-ante efficient compensation).
We consider ex-ante efficient compensation should result in the ex-ante allowed
return on capital cash flows having a present value
equal to the present value
of the ex-ante efficient cost of capital cash flows required to finance the
regulatory asset base (RAB).
This means we must set, ex-ante, an allowed rate of
return for a benchmark efficient entity such that the return on its investment
(in its RAB) equals its efficient cost. This is a zero net present value (NPV)
investment condition, which is a forward looking
concept that shows a benchmark
efficient entity is provided with a reasonable opportunity to recover at least
efficient financing
costs over the life of its investment (in its RAB).
(footnotes omitted) (ActewAGL Final Decision page 3-282; Jemena Final Decision
page 3-281)
period “over the life of its investment (in its RAB)” is unknown,
since the capital stock of a service provider has
no fixed lifespan while the
provider continues to operate. The AER’s mathematical analysis assumes a
finite life stretching
over multiple regulatory periods. For simplicity it
assumes a fixed value of the RAB throughout the “life of the assets”
(with capex exactly offsetting depreciation in each regulatory period and NPV
calculations that collapse each regulatory period into
a single period with a
constant rate of return within that period, reset at the start of each
regulatory period).
AER commented:
We note the mathematical explanation in this section is
a simplification of reality. We use it to demonstrate the principle that the
allowed rate of return should be set (and periodically reset) such that the
ex-ante allowed return on (and of) capital cash flows
equals the ex-ante cost of
a benchmark efficient entity's investment in its RAB (in present value terms).
This gives service providers
a reasonable opportunity to recover at least
efficient financing costs over the term of the RAB.
trouble is that the AER went close to assuming what it sought to prove
algebraically. If the BEE can borrow for the regulatory
period at the rate
prevailing at the beginning of the regulatory period, then the NPV = 0
condition holds, in a more or less trivial
way. If the rate of return facing the
BEE varies during the regulatory period, as it surely must, then the analysis is
approximation. The Rules require that the return on equity be fixed
for the regulatory period, and allow for that return on debt
to be fixed, but do
not require it.
same shortcoming applies, in the Tribunal’s view, to the AER’s
mathematical analysis purporting to show that its transition
satisfies the NPV = 0 condition.
present value analysis necessarily deals with the (overall) rate of return.
Translating insights from that analysis to precise
results for the return on
debt is not to be expected. The Tribunal considers, indeed, that it is
intuitively obvious that without
strong simplifying assumptions, the
NPV = 0 criterion for the rate of return cannot be converted into a
precise condition to be applied
to the return on debt. The algebra would be
intractable. In the Tribunal’s view, the AER’s analysis does not
proofs of the sort claimed, viz. that the on-the-day approach and fully
implemented trailing average approach ensure that the present
value of the
benchmark efficient entity is unchanged over the regulatory period or the life
of the assets.
Tribunal concludes that there are inconsistencies in the AER’s analysis,
and that they tend to vitiate some of the reasoning
it used to reach its
conclusions. The next question is whether they render the AER’s
conclusions amenable to the limited merits
review available to parties under the
the fact that the AER’s NPV = 0 analysis of the on-the-day
method is unconvincing does not show that the approach could
not contribute to
the achievement of the ARORO. The Tribunal regards the NPV = 0
condition as a conceptual tool rather than a formula
from which a precise value
of the return on debt can be extracted. It is no more than another way of saying
that the search required
by the ARORO provisions in the Rules is for an estimate
of the rate of return that provides
compensation for efficient
financing costs.
is ample support for the AER’s conclusion that the on-the-day approach to
estimating a return on debt can contribute to
the ARORO. That is explicit in
passages quoted above from the SFG Consulting report and from Partington and
is also consistent with the following reasoning of the Tribunal in
By using an on-the-day approach to determine cost of
capital and thus allowable revenues, the outcome – in theory at least
– is that the DNSP can expect a revenue stream consistent with what a
competitive market would generate. Capital investment
decisions made at that
date which meet a positive NPV condition using the allowed rate of return would
be efficient, based on current
conditions in the market for funds. In contrast,
if the DNSP assessed capital investment options by reference to the rate of
incorporating debt costs allowed from the trailing average approach,
inefficient investment decisions could result.
despite the inconsistencies in its analysis and in some of its assertions, the
AER was correct, the Tribunal finds, to take
the view that the on-the-day
approach could contribute to the achievement of the ARORO. It follows that the
Tribunal does not accept
that the AER’s view that its transition could
contribute to the achievement of the ARORO must be in error because, as the
submit, it relies on the view that the on-the-day approach could do
the fact that the AER’s NPV = 0 analysis of the on-the-day
method is flawed does not imply that the immediately implemented
HTA is better.
It implies nothing for that approach. We have explained above why we consider
that the AER was correct to consider
that the immediately implemented HTA would
be less likely than the on-the-day approach to contribute to the ARORO.
the AER considered, and this is not in contention, that a fully implemented HTA
would, in due course, contribute to the ARORO.
It sought to get the point of
having the HTA approach fully implemented. That seems to be a widely-accepted
goal of stakeholders
following the AEMC’s Rule change process, although
the AEMC did not consider it to be the only correct approach. The Tribunal
expressed a degree of scepticism about the HTA approach because it is a clear
departure from an opportunity cost of capital,
but accepts that no approach that
does apply a true opportunity cost of capital is available, and the HTA approach
may have certain
advantages compared to the on-the-day approach.
those circumstances, in the Tribunal’s view, the AER was bound to consider
alternatives. Setting aside continuation of the
on-the-day approach –
because the widely-held view is that in due course a fully implemented HTA will
be superior – the
clear option is a combination of the on-the-day approach
and a fully implemented HTA. The transition that the AER decided upon is
combination. Both the on-the-day approach and the transition are specifically
provided for in the Rules and it is clear that
the AEMC considered that both
could contribute to the ARORO in certain circumstances. It is not clear what the
AEMC considered those
circumstances would be, or how they would differ from each
other, or even if they would differ. Rather, it considered that it was
for the AER in each particular case. No compelling argument was ever put why, if
the fully implemented HTA approach can
contribute to achievement of the ARORO,
the transition to that outcome could not also contribute to the ARORO.
Tribunal does not consider that the AER improperly had regard to extraneous
matters, but in any case considers that those concerns
played no substantial
part in its reasoning.
Claim 3: The AER could only decide to impose a transition
under Rule 87(11)(d) and was not in fact empowered to do so by that
can be seen in the consideration above, the AER’s reasons for a transition
to the HTA do not involve resort to r 6.5.2(k)(4).
Claim 4: The AER’s decision miscarries because of a
failure to foreshadow its change of reasoning
AER made preliminary decisions when the initial proposals put to it involved a
transition to the HTA. Following those decisions,
the applicants put revised
proposals that involved immediate implementation of the HTA. The AER necessarily
addressed the newly proposed
approach in explaining why it was not changing its
position from that of the RoR Guideline and the preliminary decisions. It had
not used the NPV = 0 analysis until the Final Decisions.
this was a departure from the procedural requirements of the Law and Rules, the
Tribunal considers that that does not of itself
constitute an error providing a
ground for review. The grounds of review comprise only the three types of error
set out at [11] above.
AER’s failure to provide service providers with an opportunity to advance
arguments against its reasoning could deprive
it of useful inputs to its
reasoning, thus making it more liable to error. Indeed, the Tribunal considers
that this is the likely
purpose of the provisions in question. But any error, if
there is one, must exist apart from matters of procedure.
ground of review fails. It is not necessary for the Tribunal to consider the
issue of “materially preferable”.
Introduction
building block approach and the post-tax revenue model (
) have been
described by the Tribunal in
in terms which we adopt for
introductory purposes. The Tribunal in that case said, at [113ff]:
The NER (r 6.3) specify that the DNSP’s revenue
requirement is to be calculated using the “building block” approach.
Rule 6.4 provides detail on the building block components. Two components are
relevant in this matter. One is the allowed rate of
return on capital which is
to be calculated in accordance with cl 6.5.2. The NER (cl 6.5.2(d)(2)) specifies
that the allowed rate
of return “must be ... determined on a nominal
vanilla basis that is consistent with the estimate of the value of imputation
credits referred to in clause 6.5.3.” The second component (cl
6.4.3(b)(4)) is that “the estimated cost of corporate
income tax is
determined in accordance with clause 6.5.3”.
the Full Court said in
Australian Energy Regulator v Australian Competition
Tribunal (No 2)
at [752ff], the context is the determination of a regulated
return using a PTRM based on a nominal vanilla WACC. The Rules require
consistency in the way the relevant building blocks interact, that is, a
post-company tax and pre-personal tax and personal costs
basis. The nature of
gamma is an estimate to be used in a model. We also note that, at [756], the
Full Court said:
... it was not therefore a reviewable error for the AER
to prefer one theoretical approach to considering the determination of gamma
over another. This means that it is not an error of construction for the AER to
focus on utilisation rather than on implied market
value. This is not to say
that the AER’s approach to gamma is immune from (limited) merits review.

in principle and thereby omitted to take into account a

1987 Australia had what is called a classical taxation system under which
company profits were subject to company tax, and dividends
paid to shareholders
were taxable as part of their income (eg as personal income tax). This double
taxation of company profits created
an incentive to retain profits rather than
pay dividends, although the incentive depended on the nature of taxation on
capital gains.
Equivalently, there was a preference – now removed –
for debt financing.
the current imputation tax system, shareholders can be given franking credits
that attach to dividends and which recognise that
company tax has been paid. If
a dividend of $1 is fully franked (requiring the company in question to have
paid sufficient tax),
the franking credit is worth 43 cents. This reflects the
fact that, to pay a dividend of $1, the company needed to have taxable income
$1.43, on which it paid 30 per cent company tax, i.e. 43 cents. (These figures
are slightly rounded.) The 43 cents paid by the
company to the Australian
Taxation Office (
) is effectively given back to the shareholder by the
ATO when the shareholder lodges a tax return and then taxed in the hands of
shareholder in the same manner as cash dividends. This can result in a tax
refund to the shareholder.

they do so is one of the many, often unstated,
complications in considering returns on investment.
the system of tax imputation affects the returns on an investment. The return on
investment is central to the Australian (and
many another) system of economic
regulation (i.e. regulation concerned with the prices charged, revenues received
and profits made
by certain enterprises subject to such regulation, typically
those exhibiting natural monopoly characteristics).
explained by the AER in its Final Decisions (footnotes omitted):
The National Electricity Rules/National Gas Rules
(NER/NGR) recognises that a service provider’s allowed revenue does not
to include the value of imputation credits. Under the NER/NGR, service
providers are to recover revenue that compensates them for
their efficient costs
in providing regulated services. This includes, among other things, a return to
be provided to investors (return
on equity) that is required to promote
efficient levels of investment. The more that imputation credits are valuable,
the less return
that investors require from dividends and capital gains.
However, the estimation of the return on equity does not take imputation
into account. Therefore, an adjustment for the value of imputation credits is
required. This adjustment could take the form
of a decrease in the estimated
return on equity itself.
An alternative but equivalent form of adjustment, which is employed by the
NER/NGR, is via the revenue granted to a service provider
to cover its expected
tax liability. Specifically, the NER/NGR require that the estimated cost of
corporate income tax be determined
in accordance with a formula that reduces the
estimated cost of corporate tax by the 'value of imputation credits'
(represented by
the Greek letter, , 'gamma'). This form of adjustment recognises
that it is the payment of corporate tax which is the source of the
credit return to investors.

Tribunal set out the historical context of this part of the
as follows, at [1021]-[1029]:
Gamma was first introduced into the Australian
regulatory context in 1998 by the ACCC in the first version of the National
Electricity
Code (the Code) under Part VII of the
Trade Practices Act 1974
(Cth), in the context of calculating the weighted average cost of capital
under the imputation tax system. It was defined as the
“value of franking
credits or imputation factor”. This definition of gamma was then
introduced as part of the weighted
average cost of capital formula in Ch 6 of
the NER, which commenced operation on 1 July 2005.
2006, Ch 6A
of the NER relating to transmission services was introduced,
which broadly aligned the provision in Ch 6 relating to distribution
services as
part of the determination of the corporate income tax building block. It
defined gamma as “the assumed utilisation
of imputation credits, which is
deemed to be 0.5”. From 1 January 2008, the definition of gamma as
“the assumed utilisation
of imputation credits” was adopted in Ch
The current versions of the Rules are the result of a series of amendments
culminating in the 2012 Rule Amendments. Unlike the Code
which was initially
implemented, and as the AER has observed (in Attachment 4 to each of the JGN
Final Decision at p 4-6, the ActewAGL
Final Decision at p 4-7, and the Networks
NSW Final Decisions p 4-7), without footnotes) under the
the estimation of the return on
equity does not take imputation credits into account. Therefore, an adjustment
for the value of imputation
credits is required. This adjustment could take the
form of a decrease in the estimated return on equity itself. An alternative but
equivalent form of adjustment, which is employed by the NER/NGR, is via the
revenue granted to a service provider to cover its expected
tax liability.
...This form of adjustment recognises that it is the payment of corporate tax
which is the source of the imputation
credit return to
As the AER observes, the 2012 Rule Amendments
effectively restore the wording of the definition of gamma that appeared in the
version of the NER (incorporating Schedule 6.1 of the Code), as the
“value of franking credits”.
As observed, it is agreed between the parties that the change in the definition
of gamma in the Rules from the “assumed utilisation
of imputation
credits” to the “value of imputation credits” does not change
the meaning of gamma. Instead, the
dispute concerns what that meaning is.
The Rules continue to reflect the relationship between imputation credits and
the cost of capital in the method of calculating the
rate of return.
Relevantly, r 6.5.2(d) of the NER provides that:
allowed rate of
for a regulatory year must be:
(1) a weighted average of the return on equity for the
regulatory control
in which that
regulatory year
occurs (as estimated under
paragraph (f) and the return on debt for that
regulatory year
estimated under paragraph (h)); and
(2) determined on a nominal vanilla basis that is
consistent with the
estimate of the value of imputation credits
referred to in clause 6.5.3.
[emphasis in bold added]
Rule 87(2)(4) of the NGR is in similar terms.
As noted elsewhere in these reasons, the 2012 Rule Amendments also introduced a
requirement for the AER to periodically publish the
RoR Guideline: r 6.5.2(m) of
the NER and r 87(13) of the NGR. As required, the RoR Guideline sets out
(among other things) the estimation
methods, financial models, market data and
other evidence the AER proposes to take into account in estimating the value of
credits under r 6.5.3 of the NER and r 87A of the NGR: r
6.5.2(n) of the NER and r 87(14) of the NGR. Also as noted elsewhere in
reasons, while the RoR Guideline is not binding on the AER in relation to making
individual determinations, if the AER makes
a decision that is not in accordance
with the RoR Guideline, it must state its reasons for departing from the them: r
6.2.8(c) of
the NER and r 87(18) of the NGR.
In accordance with the Rules, as indicated above, the AER published the RoR
Guideline in December 2013, setting out (amongst other
things) guidelines for
estimating imputation credits. In keeping with accepted interpretation and
practice, the AER’s gamma
decision calculated the value of imputation
credits as the product of the distribution rate for imputation credits and the
utilisation
rate of distributed imputation credits. The estimates outlined at
p 23 of the RoR Guideline were an estimate of 0.5 for the value
imputation credits, based on a distribution rate of 0.7 and a utilisation rate
to the position in
, in the present proceedings there was a
difference between the parties as to the significance of the change in the
definition of
gamma in the Rules.
[1083] the Tribunal stated: “It is ... clear that the intent of the
changes to the NER and the NEL was to allow the AER
greater flexibility to adopt
a more sophisticated approach to the cost of capital than previously envisaged
by the NER and the NEL.”
comments of the Tribunal in
at [118]-[120] are also
The dispute over gamma needs to be placed in the context
of changes made to the NER in November 2012 which changed the terminology
to describe gamma. Prior to that change, gamma was defined as “the assumed
utilisation of franking credits”. Subsequently
it has been defined (NER cl
6.5.3) as “the value of imputation credits”. No specific definition
of what that term means,
or how it is to be estimated, is given, other than that
it needs to be consistent with the “vanilla WACC” approach.
Those rule changes also gave increased flexibility to the regulator in
determination of the value to be chosen for gamma. “The
prescription of the gamma value of 0.5 in clause 6A.6.4 has also been removed to
allow the regulator the ability to estimate
an appropriate value that reflects
the best available evidence at the time of a decision and would therefore result
in a rate of
return that meets the overall objective.” (AEMC, Rule
Determination: National Electricity Amendment (Economic Regulation of
Service Providers) Rule 2012, p 68).
Other than this statement, there appears to be no other explanation given for
the change in terminology from “assumed utilisation”
“value”, although the latter term (even though not specifically
defined) is more consistent with the flexibility given
to the regulator and
requirement (NER cl 6.5.2(e)) that:
In determining the allowed
rate of return, regard must be had to:
(1) relevant estimation methods, financial models, market data and other
(2) the desirability of using an approach that leads to the consistent
application of any estimates of financial parameters that are
relevant to the
estimates of, and that are common to, the return on equity and the return on
(3) any interrelationships between estimates of financial parameters that are
relevant to the estimates of the return on equity and
the return on
might be noted that in 2010, the Tribunal had proposed that an expert study be
undertaken to estimate theta, following which in
May 2011 it decided (
) that the appropriate value for theta was 0.35 and for the distribution
rate was 0.7, giving a value for gamma of 0.25. That value
of gamma was applied
in regulatory determinations by the AER until it published the RoR Guideline.
What the AER decided
AER’s Final Decisions set a value for gamma of 0.4, having rejected the
applicants’ proposed value of 0.25. The effect
was to reduce the revenue
allowed for the cost of corporate income tax below the amounts sought by the
applicants (or equivalently,
as explained above, reduce the allowed rate of
return on equity).
is common ground that the value of imputation credits, gamma, can be considered
to be the product of two ratios: the distribution
rate (F), which is the
proportion of imputation credits generated that is distributed to investors, and
the utilisation rate (theta),
which is the per dollar value to investors of
imputation credits distributed.
AER considered that it was not required to determine specific values for the
distribution rate and utilisation rate separately.
Rather, in each case it
considered ranges, and consequently a range of values for gamma, from which it
made a choice of what it considered
the most appropriate
The distribution rate
AER considered that a reasonable estimate of the distribution rate for listed
equity was 0.75, and for all equity was 0.70.
The utilisation rate
will be seen, the crux of the disagreement between the AER and the relevant
applicants is about the utilisation rate. The AER
stated that (footnotes
omitted) “[t]here is no consensus among experts or regulators on the value
of imputation credits or
the techniques to use to estimate it” and that:
The role of the value of the imputation credits in the
revenue building block framework suggests that the value of imputation credits
is intended to reflect the value of imputation credits to investors in the
benchmark efficient entity.
The framework developed in a 1994 paper by Officer is widely recognised as
providing the basis for the value of imputation credits
in the building block
framework. A key implication of Officer's framework is that the value of
imputation credits should be estimated
on a before-personal-tax and
before-personal-costs basis. This is consistent with a rate of return determined
on a nominal vanilla
(that is, a post-company tax pre-personal tax and costs)
basis. Therefore, we view the value of imputation credits as the proportion
company tax returned to investors through the utilisation of imputation credits.
considered that (footnote omitted):
or an ‘eligible’ investor, each dollar of
imputation credit received can be fully returned to the investor in the form
a reduction in tax payable or a refund. Therefore, we consider that eligible
investors have a utilisation rate of 1. Conversely,
‘ineligible’
investors cannot utilise imputation credits and have a utilisation rate of 0.
It follows that the utilisation
rate reflects the extent to which investors can
utilise the imputation credits they receive to reduce their tax or obtain a

the AER said that “one dollar of claimed imputation credits has a post
(company) tax value of one dollar to investors,
before personal taxes and
personal transaction costs.”
Tribunal notes that there is a degree of looseness in these statements between
“imputation credits expected to be utilised”
and “claimed
imputation credits”; and as to whether face value applies on a
“pre-personal tax basis” or “before
personal taxes and
personal transaction costs”.
reaching its views, the AER relied upon expert reports from Handley and Lally.
Among other things these dealt with the development
of the Officer framework by
Monkhouse and Lally and van Zijl to interpret Officer’s seminal paper. One
aspect of that development
was that the utilisation rate is the weighted
average, by wealth and risk aversion, of the utilisation rates of individual
AER stated (footnote omitted):
We do not contend that the Officer Paper is a
“statute or a code”. However, as the Officer Paper underpins the
of gamma in the corporate income tax formula in NER 6.5.3 and NGR 87A,
it is fundamental to a coherent understanding of the role
of gamma in the
regulatory scheme.
The Officer Paper specifically identified gamma in its WACC formulae to be the
“proportion of tax collected from the company
which gives rise to the tax
credit associated with a franked dividend”: It directly supports an
interpretation of gamma which
is focused on the utilisation or redemption of
imputation credits, and an approach to theta which seeks to identify the
of investors that are eligible to utilise distributed imputation
credits. So much is confirmed by Handley, who states:
It is clear from Monkhouse (1996) that the
second parameter refers to the utilisation value of a distributed imputation
credit. This
parameter is commonly denoted and called theta. It is also clear
from the post-tax basis of the regulatory framework (and the Officer
Monkhouse WACC frameworks) that the item of interest is more precisely described
as the after-company-before-personal-tax utilisation
value of a distributed
imputation credit.
the Final Decisions the AER identified three types of evidence for estimating
the utilisation rate:
the proportion
of Australian equity held by domestic investors (the ‘equity ownership

first, less reliance on the second, and even
less on the third. This judgement
was supported by Handley and Lally.
equity ownership
approach – using the proportion of equity held by
Australian investors – reflects the fact that foreign investors are
to utilise imputation credits (because they do not pay tax in Australia at the
personal or equivalent level). The AER placed
significant reliance on the equity
ownership approach because:
aligned with the definition of the utilisation rate in the Monkhouse
it employs a
relatively simple and intuitive methodology
reliable and transparent source of data
it provides
estimates of the utilisation rate for investors in both all equity and only
listed equity.
went on to say (footnotes omitted):
We recognise the equity ownership approach does not take
into account the existence of some domestic investors that do not hold their
shares for 45 days at risk over the ex-dividend date (the 45 day rule). However,
we consider it is unlikely to have a material impact
on the utilisation of
imputation credits by domestic investors. Importantly, no data has been
presented that demonstrates a material
We also recognise the equity ownership approach produces a range of estimates of
the utilisation rate, and the upper end of this
range is higher than the
estimate produced from tax statistics (see discussion under ‘Tax
statistics’ below). However,
we do not consider this means the equity
ownership approach is incorrect. This is because tax statistics, like the equity
approach, produce an estimate of the utilisation rate. These estimates
are uncertain and dependent on the quality of the underlying
data (this is a
particular issue for tax statistics). As such, the true (unknown) value could be
higher or lower. Following this,
we do not consider the 45 day rule explains the
difference in utilisation rate estimates between tax statistics and the equity
approach. We consider the difference is likely driven by estimation
error in the taxation data. This view is supported by Lally.
We also note
Lally's statement that:
Thus, if foreign investors are recognized
and absent any information on the terms other than the value weights on the RHS
of equation
(8), the equity ownership approach is not an upper bound on theta
but an unbiased estimate.
AER considered equity ownership proportions for both all equity and listed
equity only, with the matching distribution rates.
This gave corresponding
ranges for gamma of 0.40 to 0.47, and 0.28 to 0.41, respectively, from which it
selected 0.4, which is within
the overlap of 0.40 to 0.41.
, which apply to all equity but not the subset of listed equity,
gave a lower estimate of gamma of 0.34. The AER considered that the
statistics were neither complete (ie did not include some credits that were in
fact claimed) nor accurate, and placed less reliance
on them. In this it relied
on advice from Hathaway that “conclude[s] that the ATO statistics cannot
be relied upon for making
conclusions about the utilisation credits” and
he would “urge all caution in using ATO statistics for any estimates of
parameters concerned with franking credits”.
advice was referred to and was reinforced by Handley and Lally.
particular, Hathaway showed why the tax statistics based in franking account
balances were reliable, but those based in dividends
were not, with a very large
discrepancy.
market study
considered, provided by the applicants, gave a value of
gamma of 0.26, but the AER considered that if that study and approach were
accepted, the estimate would need to be adjusted upward, to 0.30. The market
study necessarily applied only to listed equity.
The AER’s rejection of
that study was supported by Handley and Lally.
AER justified its rejection of (or giving least weight to) drop-off studies,
with references to expert advice, on the basis that:
The results of
these studies might not be reflective of the value of imputation credits to
investors in the market as a whole. For
instance, in dividend drop-off studies
the value of imputation credits is determined by the marginal investor that
trades around
the ex-dividend date. There is no reason to assume this reflects
the value that long term investors who provide capital to a benchmark
entity place on imputation credits in aggregate.
It is only the
value of the combined package of dividends and imputation credits that can be
observed in the market. However, there
is no consensus among experts on how to
separate the value of dividends from the value of imputation credits.
drop-off estimates of the utilisation rate do not produce a post-tax
(pre-personal tax) estimate and therefore do not produce
estimates consistent
with the Officer post-tax framework. The dividend drop-off estimate is
influenced by differential personal
taxes, given that investors value capital

relevant applicants say that the AER erred in that, in respect of the
distribution rate:
It should have
considered only the figure for all equity, not that for listed equity, because
listed equity firms are not a good proxy
for the benchmark efficient entity,
because the benchmark efficient entity has 100 per cent Australian income. The
receipt of foreign
income had the potential to significantly alter the
distribution rate.
In respect of the utilisation rate:
approach of assessing gamma as the utilisation rate or face value of the credits
was not consistent with the ordinary
meaning of the term “value of
imputation credits”, with the assessment of the rate of return parameters,
or with the
national electricity objective.
The AER was
incorrect in concluding that the assessment on a pre-personal-tax and
pre-personal-costs basis supports face value. Rather,
the value of imputation
credits needed to reflect their value to investors taking into account the
effects of personal taxes and
ownership approach did not measure the value to the investor of imputation
credits. It merely identified and quantified
one class of investor who could not
utilise credits. It was even above a proper measure of the utilisation rate,
because it did not
account for Australian resident investors who could not or
did not utilise credits. Equity ownership figures were therefore above
Tax statistics
also did not measure the value of imputation credits to investors, as they did
not capture matters that reduce that
value. They were therefore an upper bound.
However, this upper bound was below the AER’s figure for gamma. Contrary

for gamma. By contrast, the AER’s demonstration of

The applicants’ submissions
two remaining applicants contended for a distribution rate of 0.7 and an
utilisation rate of 0.35, which multiplied together and
rounded gave their
contended-for value of 0.25 for gamma. The distribution rate was taken from
statistics for all equity. The utilisation
rate came from a dividend drop-off
study conducted by the consulting firm SFG for the energy networks. The study
sought to estimate
the value placed by the market on imputation credits by
investigating the amount by which share prices fell when they go ex-dividend,
when ownership of the share no longer conferred a right to a dividend and
associated imputation credits.

returns expected) by short, medium and long term traders.
this stage it is necessary for the Tribunal to give some information about the
two previous decisions by the Tribunal, referred
to above, on essentially the
identical issue before this Tribunal, the value of imputation credits.
the Tribunal concluded, at [1100]:
We consider that, by ... effectively defining the
utilisation rate as the proportion of distributed imputation credits available
redemption, the AER has adopted a conceptual approach to gamma that
redefines it as the value of imputation credits that are available
redemption. This is inconsistent with the concept of gamma in the Officer
Framework for the WACC which underlies the Rules, and
with the objective of
ensuring a market rate of return on equity by making an adjustment to the
revenue allowance for taxation to
account for imputation
Tribunal also accepted the view of Professor Gray of SFG for the applicants and
concluded, at [1073], that the AER’s reasoning
(in that decision, but the
reasoning is the same in this decision) ignored the fact that the other
parameters in the WACC calculations
were market values that already incorporated
the effects of the differences in investors’ tax positions and
transactions costs.
, a differently constituted Tribunal found that the AER was not in
error. The applicants contend at the hearing before the present
Tribunal that
that decision, which is subject to a judicial review application in the Federal
Court, was in error. Essentially, the
applicants submitted that the Tribunal
there wrongly treated the issue as one of weighing evidence, and did not
properly address
the meaning of “value of imputation credits”.
their written submissions, the applicants argued that a detailed debate between
experts about how particular statements by Officer
should be interpreted had
distracted the AER’s attention from the proper inquiry as a matter of
economic regulation; and that
“Officer’s papers are not a statute or
a code. Seeking to parse and analyse Professor Officer’s papers is not a
substitute for a proper consideration of the role of imputation credits pursuant
to the regime established by the NER.”
Nevertheless,
the applicants then quoted a footnote in Officer’s paper to support their
interpretation:
Where there is a market for tax credits one could use
the market price to estimate the value of γ for the marginal shareholder,
i.e. the shareholder who implicitly sets the price of the shares and the price
of γ and the company’s cost of capital
at the margin, but where there
is only a covert market, estimates can only be made through dividend drop-off
applicants placed significance on the 2012 Rule Amendments. They said that the
amendments brought the language of the rule –
“value of imputation
credits” in place of “assumed utilisation of imputation
credits” – into line with
regulatory practice. They saw some irony
in the fact that, while the
now referred to the “value of
imputation credits”, rather than the “assumed utilisation of
imputation credits”,
the AER’s approach in applying the
had gone in the opposite direction.
applicants argued, by reference to the table reproduced at [207] above, that the
equity ownership approach failed to take account
of three of the reasons why
some investors may not value imputation credits at face value; and the use of
tax statistics failed to
take into account one of the reasons. Therefore, both
those approaches could only give estimates that were upper bounds on the best
applicants also submitted that the AER erred in using equity ownership figures
over the period since July 2000 (when the tax laws
changed) rather than current
figures; and that, in contrast with their position with the distribution rate,
the AER should have used
only figures for listed equity rather than also
considering all equity. The argument was that the proportion of foreign equity
listed companies was more likely to reflect the proportion in the BEE; all
equity includes small, privately held companies, which
are not as accessible to
foreign investors as the BEE (or as electricity and gas service providers in
Australia, a number of which
are privately and foreign owned).
applicants also questioned the AER’s concerns about the completeness and
reliability of tax statistics.
their oral submissions, the applicants submitted that tax statistics could be
used to avoid separate consideration of the distribution
rate and the
utilisation rate.
figures from Hathaway’s paper, relied on by the AER and referred to above,
the applicants derived an estimate of gamma
by dividing credits redeemed by
credits created, giving a figure of 0.3, or 0.34 using more recent data, noting
that in their contention
this was an upper bound. According to the applicants,
the figures for credits created and credits redeemed were reliable, and were
considered to be so by Hathaway. They pointed to a reference to that
The AER’s submissions
its written submissions, the AER largely repeated the reasoning in its Final
Decisions. In that reasoning the AER relied on expert
economic advice, in
particular from Handley and Lally. For example, Handley’s advice was that
“the per dollar value of
an imputation credit γ gamma should be
measured prior to any personal tax on the credit and prior to any personal costs
with the receipt of the credit”. (The AER noted that
“[a]lthough the term ‘personal’ is used, we note that
of investors other than individual persons can value imputation credits (for
example, superannuation funds and charities).
Therefore, an alternative
characterisation might be ‘before-investor-tax’ and
‘before-investor-costs’.”)
AER pointed to a series of statements by the Tribunal over some years to the
effect that there was no one way of measuring gamma,
and that the estimation
methodology was subject to continual change. Internal consistency was a key
requirement, and its approach
achieved that, being supported by a number of
economic experts, and was not found to be in error by the Tribunal in
weighting of evidence – from the three approaches mentioned above –
was, in the AER’s contention, a matter of
regulatory judgement. It could
not be concluded, the AER submitted, that the AER’s position was wrong and
that the applicants’
– which relied entirely on a dividend drop-off
study – was right.
in oral submissions, Counsel for the AER used an argument that seemed to be
different from the reasoning in the Final Decisions,
and to break new ground.
Certainly it was characterised that way by Senior Counsel for the applicants. It
amounted to an argument
for the AER accepted that dividends and imputation credits can be valued by
those entitled to them at less than face value,
and indeed adopted the
applicants’ table, reproduced at [207] above.
a post-tax valuation framework, or revenue framework, both the cash flows and
the cost of capital were estimated before investor
taxes and before investor
costs. The observed returns based on stock prices reflected the full range of
investor taxes and investor
costs that affected the investment. To the extent
that they diminished the value of an equity investment, that would be reflected
in the asset price and the required return be higher as a result.
AER contended that because those costs were capitalised into share prices and
reflected in the return on equity, investors were
compensated for those costs
through the allowed return on equity, which were already in the allowed cash
flows under the building
block framework.
applicants’ approach, as characterised by Counsel for the AER, was to
provide compensation for the same costs a second time
through the allowance for
company tax.
submissions referred to so far deal with the in-principle and practical case
against a reliance, much less a complete reliance,
on the dividend drop-off
study put forward by the applicants. The AER also responded to specific points
raised by the applicants
regarding the equity ownership and tax statistics
approaches.
AER argued that neither the equity ownership approach nor the use of tax
statistics provided point estimates. They generated ranges.
Therefore, a
particular estimate within the range could not be considered an upper bound.
This was consistent with expert economic
pointed out that the applicants argued for the use only of all equity (and not
listed equity) data in estimating the distribution
rate, and the use of only
listed equity (and not all equity) in estimating the utilisation rate. In both
cases, the applicants’
argument was by reference to the BEE. The AER
pointed out that in each case it considered both listed equity and all equity,
matched the corresponding estimates.
the period over which it estimated the proportion of foreign equity ownership
(since July 2000), the AER argued that there
was no reason why the most recent
period would provide the best estimate for the forthcoming regulatory period.
The period it chose
was consistent with the period used in the applicants’
own dividend drop-off study.
AER argued that it had specifically considered the category of investors who
were unable to redeem imputation credits because
of the 45-day rule, but were
not captured in equity ownership approach estimates, and concluded that it was
not material.
the use of tax statistics, the AER argued that it was clear from the Hathaway
report that the figure for credits redeemed
in fact came from the unreliable
dividend data rather than the reliable franking account balance data: a table in
report appeared to show that. This would be consistent with
Hathaway’s clear warnings against using the ATO data for drawing
conclusions about the utilisation of franking credits.
AER received advice from Lally on the Tribunal’s
In that advice Lally stated, in relation to the value of imputation credits,
“...the NER is not the arbiter on this
matter. Nor is the ACT ... Instead,
one must look to the relevant economic literature.” He then went on to
analyse Officer’s
paper and later derivations of gamma under that
AER received Lally’s most recent advice too late in the piece for the
network distributors to have had an opportunity to
respond to it before the AER
made its Final Decisions. However, the applicants made submissions on it.
AER drew attention to the decision of the Tribunal in
that the AER
did not err in regard to gamma. Counsel relied more on that Tribunal’s
conclusions than on its detailed reasoning.
The Full Court’s decision
mentioned above, after the hearing in these proceedings, the Full Court’s
decision on its judicial review of the Tribunal’s
was handed down. That decision is
Australian Energy Regulator v Australian
Competition Tribunal (No 2)
. The parties were invited to make submissions
on the effect of the decision, and did so.
applicants made the following points.
[751]-[755], the Full Court concluded that the Tribunal had erred in law in its
construction of r 6.5.3 of the
, in failing to construe the phrase as
a whole in its context and having regard to the subject matter of the exercise.
The Full Court
said that it accepted the AER’s submission that the context
was the determination of a regulated return using a PTRM based
on a nominal
vanilla WACC, and accepted the AER’s submission that the Rules required
consistency in the way the relevant building
blocks interacted, that is, a
post-company tax and pre-personal tax and personal costs basis. The Full Court
observed that, as the
nature of gamma was an estimate to be used in a model, the
context related to a statutory model rather than the value of something
existed, and that the Tribunal was distracted by the apparent simplicity of the
concept of market studies and data into mistaking
what was to be estimated as
real in a market rather than as estimates within a model. The Full Court went on
to state, at [755],
... we accept the AER’s submission the
Tribunal’s approach to gamma was underpinned by a misunderstanding on its
our opinion the Tribunal assumed that other parameters in
the WACC calculations
were market values that already incorporated investors’ tax positions and
transaction costs but that
misconstrued the “post-tax” framework.
The rules required gamma to be determined consistently with return on
that approach in the present case, one would need to consider the content of the
model. In this regard, it was apparent that
the Full Court had before it
different information from the information which was before this Tribunal as to
the nature of the model.
the present case, the position adopted by the AER was that its rate of return
model did not ignore, or fail to incorporate, personal
transaction costs. The
AER had conceded that the model needed to account for them in some way. Rather,
the position adopted by the
AER was that they were already taken into account in
the assessment of the return on equity because they affected asset prices, which
in turn affected the measurement of the required return on equity. This was
explained by Counsel for the AER at pages 627-639 of
the transcript. It was a
lengthy explanation, but required reading in full to see how the operation of
the model was explained.
applicants submitted that the AER’s explanation was directly contrary to
the observations of the Full Court at [755] as
to the content of the model,
extracted at [280] above.
difference arose from the different material that was before the Full Court and
this Tribunal. So even if the approach of the
Full Court was applied (to treat
imputation credits as a function of a model, rather than as something that was
that directed attention to the content of the model and to
the evidence on that model in the individual case.
in the present case, Counsel for the AER, at pages 648-651 of the transcript,
discussed the decision of the Tribunal in
in terms that made it
clear that the Tribunal was correct to assume that other parameters
“already incorporated investors’
tax positions and transaction
costs”, but stated that to account for them in relation to imputation
credits would involve some
measure of double counting.
briefly restating the argument they had made in the hearing, the applicants
submitted that the position before the present Tribunal
(a) the AER accepted that matters affecting
the value of imputation credits, such as transaction costs, are
need to be taken into account
– the model did not exclude
(b) the AER said they were taken into account in the assessment of asset prices,
and therefore did not need to be included in the
gamma calculation;
(c) however, the AER was incorrect in stating that transactions costs and other
matters affecting the value of imputation credits
were already reflected in the
return on equity calculation, for the reasons developed by the applicants in
oral reply.
these circumstances, the applicants submitted, the decision of the Full Court
did not determine the Tribunal’s assessment
of the gamma topic. Rather, it
emphasised that the correct approach to gamma depended upon the content of the
model used to calculate
the overall rate of return of the regulated business.
That model, properly understood on the material before the Tribunal in the
present case, required two adjustments for the value of imputation credits: to
gross up post-1987 return on equity calculations to
exclude the value of
imputation credits (so as to produce an overall average market risk premium, and
thus an overall return on equity,
unaffected by imputation credits), and then to
deduct the value of imputation credits. At each stage, matters affecting the
of imputation credits must be taken into account under the model.
did the Full Court decision determine a number of the other grounds for review
concerning the gamma topic. On any view as to
the construction of r 6.5.3 of
, these grounds would still need to be determined by the Tribunal.
applicants accepted that the Full Court decision had implications for those
aspects of the Applications relying on the plain meaning
of the term “the
value of imputation credits”. However, as explained above, they submitted
that the decision of the Full
Court did not otherwise determine the
Tribunal’s assessment of the gamma topic.
AER made the following submissions (omitting footnotes but adding references to
the decision).
relation to the topic of gamma, the decision of the Full Court in
Australian Competition Tribunal (No 2)
was dispositive of the primary ground
of review, the correct interpretation of the phrase “the value of
imputation credits”
r 87A. The findings
of the Full Court also had implications for other gamma grounds of review.
Full Court made the following findings that were relevant to the gamma grounds
of review in this proceeding:
(a) The appropriate method to determine
“the value of imputation credits” within
and the sources of information and/or weight to be attributed to each data
source, was a derivative of the interpretation
of that term (at [742]).
(b) The expression “the value of imputation credits” was be
construed as a whole, in its statutory context and having
regard to the subject
matter of the exercise. It would be an error to limit attention to the word
“value” and give it
a meaning in isolation. The relevant context was
the function of imputation credits under the
in relation to the
return on capital and the tax building block and, in particular, the
determination of a regulated return using
a PTRM based on a nominal vanilla
required consistency in the way the relevant building
blocks interacted (at [744], [751] and [752]).
(c) It was a misconstruction of the expression “the value of imputation
credits” to interpret “value” as
a “market value”
derived from market studies rather than a value within a PTRM in which the
integers were determined
on a consistent basis (at [753] and [755]).
(d) It was not an error of construction for the AER to prefer one theoretical
approach to considering the determination of gamma
over another. Specifically,
the AER did not err by focusing on the utilisation of imputation credits rather
than on an implied market
submissions of the AER to the Tribunal were consistent with and supported by the
findings of the Full Court summarised above.
of the service providers raised as its primary ground of review with respect to
gamma a contention that the AER adopted an incorrect
construction of the words
“value of imputation credits”. These grounds must be dismissed
because the binding decision
of the Full Court was that the interpretation of
that phrase adopted by the AER in its Final Decisions was correct. The arguments
advanced by the service providers before the Tribunal were materially the same
as the arguments advanced by the service providers
to the Full Court, which were
rejected by the Full Court.
conclusions reached by the Full Court also had implications for other grounds of
review raised in relation to gamma. As paragraph
117 of the joint submissions on
gamma records, other grounds raised in relation to gamma with respect to the
weight given to the
equity ownership approach (paragraphs 117(a) and 119 to
135), the weight given to market value derived from dividend drop-off studies
(paragraphs 117(b) and 167 to 205) and the adjustments made by the AER to the
results of dividend drop-off studies (paragraphs 117(c)
and 173 to 177) also
depended on the primary ground with respect to construction.
applicants’ supplementary submission that the Full Court had before it
different information to that which is before this
Tribunal as to the nature of
the model (the PTRM) used by the AER should be rejected. There was no relevant
difference in the model,
nor any relevant difference in the information before
the Tribunal about the model. As previously acknowledged by the applicants,
AER’s decision in Networks NSW, SAPN and in these matters is
“essentially the same decision by the AER”. The
applicants’
further supplementary submissions concerning the PTRM used by the AER revisited
matters addressed before the Tribunal.
The submissions failed to address the
economic evidence relied upon by the AER (particularly Associate Professor
Handley) as to why
it was correct to focus upon utilisation rather than implied
market value. The AER otherwise relied upon its submissions previously
the Tribunal.
ECA submitted that the Tribunal was bound by the decision of the Full Court. In
the absence of any development in economic theory,
or the intrusion of some
other distinguishing factor, the Full Court had resolved that: (a) the AER had
discretion in respect of
its theoretical approach to gamma; and (b) the adoption
of a gamma value of 0.4 on the basis of the AER’s preferred theoretical
approach was a defensible one. The ECA made two further observations. First, it
submitted that if the Tribunal were to require the
adoption of a gamma value of
0.25, as the applicants were contending, that result would mean substantial
additional revenue to the
applicants, and a corresponding increase in the price
paid by energy consumers. The Tribunal ought only to be satisfied with an
resulting in additional revenue for a network business (and a
corresponding increase in energy prices) if the business had clearly
real and substantial improvements to quality, reliability, security or safety in
the long-term interests of consumers
that would serve to justify such an
increase. Second, the ECA observed that arguably the appropriate gamma value may
be even higher
than the figure which the AER had adopted over the
applicants’ objections. The Tribunal should not be quick to find that
every alleged error in favour of the network businesses’
increased revenue was necessary to achieve optimally efficient balance
price, quality, reliability, security and safety. Rather, the relatively
stronger incentives for network businesses to engage
in self-help, as compared
to other stakeholders, would tend to increase revenues at the expense of
optimally efficient pricing in
mentioned at [46] above, CitiPower, Powercor, United Energy and AusNet Services,
by letter dated 21 July 2017, informed the Tribunal
that they now wished not to
press their grounds of review in respect of gamma. This left ActewAGL and Jemena
as continuing to press
the gamma grounds.
The Tribunal’s analysis
The distribution rate
Tribunal finds that it was open to the AER to consider both listed and all
equity consistent with matching the distribution and
utilisation rate estimates
for each of those categories. Only one of its sources of expert advice, Lally,
took a view against the
need for matching, but his advice would have given an
outcome less favourable to the applicants than that decided upon by the
The meaning of “value of imputation credits”
applicants’ submission that the oft-repeated statement that “value
of imputation credits” should be given its
ordinary meaning does not sit
easily with the equally oft-repeated statement that “value of imputation
credits” should
be interpreted in the light of its conceptual role in the
. In fact, all parties accept the second proposition; but
the interpretation requires a careful study of the complex regulatory framework
within which the phrase is embedded, and the elaborate and more complex economic
framework which underlies the regulatory framework.
Tribunal was invited to take offence at the provocatively worded statement by
Lally, quoted above at [275], in his advice to the
AER on the Tribunal’s
decision. It is of course the case that the task of statutory
construction cannot be handed over to economic experts, but the views
experts are valuable, and necessary, in considering how the concepts underlying
, and the processes required under the
, relate to each other and should be implemented. The applicants, no
less than the AER, have been guided by such evidence.
being the case, it is inevitable that consideration of the meaning of “the
value of imputation credits”, and how
to estimate it, involves economic
deal first with the implications of the Full Court’s decision. In the
Tribunal’s view, the arguments of the AER and
the ECA are compelling. The
issues raised by the applicants in these proceedings were said by themselves to
be substantially the
same as those raised in
. The context –
the determination of a regulated rate of return using a PTRM based on a nominal
vanilla WACC – is the
same. The model itself is the same.
applicants nevertheless now appear to argue that the content of the model is
different from that in the earlier matters because
the AER argued its case
differently. They say that the Tribunal in these proceedings has different
information before it as to the
nature of the model from what was before the
Full Court.
submission must be rejected if only because the Full Court was not grappling
with the intricacies of the model, but only with
whether the Tribunal’s
decision in
accorded with the law, specifically on a question of
statutory construction.
applicants made it very clear that their contention was that “value of
imputation credits” must, under the
interpreted as meaning “market value of imputation credits”. The
Full Court decision makes it equally clear that
that construction is wrong.
it does not follow that, not being in legal error in its
on gamma on that ground, the AER had carte blanche in the estimation of the
value of estimation credits. These proceedings
did raise new issues which were
not part of the
proceedings, for example the arguments used in
and a new line of argument by Counsel for the AER. The Tribunal
considers that it is worthwhile to discuss those arguments before
moving on to
whether there are any remaining statutory errors in the AER’s decision on
Market estimates
applicants’ principal submission was that a market estimate of the value
of imputation credits was required by the Rules,
in particular for consistency
with the market-based method for estimating the required rate of return on
equity in the PTRM.
applicants submitted that what this required was not an ignoring of investor tax
and investor costs, but an estimation of the
value of imputation credits that
took account of those factors. However, the applicants also explicitly accepted
that the value should
be after company tax and pre-investor tax and pre-investor
of the consideration of how gamma should be estimated depends on resolving these
differences.
applicants’ exposition was couched in terms of the value of imputation
credits to “the investor”. Much of the
argument was put in terms of
the liability for investor income tax and the investor costs incurred by
“investors”, “the
investor”, or “the typical
investor”, which may mean the same as an average investor.
...if the risk-free rate is 3%, and a typical investor
needs a margin of 4% above the risk-free rate to make an investment in the
particular entity, and if the investor has accountancy, brokerage and other
costs of 1%, and if the investor incurs foreign currency
fees of 0.5%, then the
entity will need to be providing a return of 8.5% for this investor to invest in
the business (rather than
leaving his or her money in the bank or in
Commonwealth Government Securities).
The same approach is necessary for the discount attributable to the value of
imputation credits. If the investor receives imputation
credits with a face
amount of 2% of the investment, but it costs the investor 1% to realise the
credits, then the investor is only
receiving a 1% net benefit from the
imputation credits, which would reduce the overall required return to
this exposition may be helpful up to a point, it risks hiding or begging
important questions. Who or what is the typical
investor? What rate of return is
required by him or her or it? Most importantly, is it the typical
investor’s required rate
of return that determines the rate of return to
be estimated under the Rules?
The marginal investor vs the average investor
applicants’ submissions jumped from “the typical investor” to
the use of market value derived from a dividend
drop-off study on the basis that
the market value was set by the average valuation across all investors weighted
by wealth and risk
aversion. In their written submissions, they noted:
This example uses a single investor, but in reality the
required return is a product of the individual wealth, appetite for risk,
idiosyncratic position, of investors as a whole. The equilibrium position
produced by the sum of individual investors (as reflected
in the share price,
and thus the return received by those investors) is the required return. That
required return incorporates all
matters (such as investor costs) that are taken
into account by the multitude of individual investors.
it was presented to the Tribunal, this was no more than an assertion. No
information was provided about the weighting. The implication
was that the
market value studies automatically reflected the effect of the weighting.
However, it appeared to be consistent with
the AER’s citation of the
Monkhouse framework – an extension of Officer’s work – in
which, it said, “...
the utilisation rate is equal to the weighted
average, by wealth and risk aversion, of the utilisation rates of individual
investors.”
Handley referred to the Monkhouse framework in his advice
mentioned above.
while the Monkhouse framework was referred to many times in the AER’s
Final Decisions, it was not specifically brought to
the Tribunal’s
attention. This question of how prices are set in the market – whether by
the average investor or the
marginal investor – was referred to above in a
reference to the applicants’ submissions in relation to the
decision, where the issue loomed large.
its reasons in
, the Tribunal considered whether the market return
was set by the average of investors, in some such way as described above, or by
the marginal investor. The latter proposition might better be described as the
marginal trade in the market between two investors,
a buyer and a seller. This
is a natural inquiry to be interested in when trying to understand the nature of
the required rate of
return, which is a necessary focus in interpreting and
applying the
Tribunal in
did not express a final view. It stated, at [158], that
“... the available empirical evidence is inadequate to enable confident
discrimination between these alternative approaches.” It noted a number of
references to the marginal investor in the Officer
paper, but considered that
Officer’s work could not be appealed to so as to settle the interpretation
of “value of imputation
credits”, and considered, at [186], that the
applicant’s submission in those proceedings was incorrect if “stock
prices (and thus imputation credit value) are determined by some marginal
investor”, noting, at [193], that how stock prices
were determined was an
unsettled issue between experts (by which it meant experts at large, not just
those engaged in those proceedings).
these proceedings, the marginal vs average investor issue similarly did not
arise clearly in the AER’s reasoning in its Final
Decisions, as it had not
in the decisions reviewed in
. But as alluded to
above, it appears that a particular view underlay some of the advice given to
the AER and the view that it came
to. The applicants argued that the issue was a
distraction. The AER submitted that none of its reasoning depended on the
vs average distinction and, in answer to questions, agreed with Senior
Counsel for the applicants that the distinction was not helpful
proceedings.
Tribunal does not find it so easy to set aside. There are a number of references
in the Final Decisions to the AER’s view
that the utilisation rate is
equal to the weighted average, by wealth and risk aversion, of the utilisation
rates of individual investors.
The AER also held the view that in dividend
drop-off studies the value of imputation credits is determined by the marginal
that trade around the ex-dividend date. This inconsistency with its
view that a weighted average value ought to be estimated contributed
rejection of dividend drop-off studies.
AER’s view of how the weighted average valuation by investors relates to
the marginal valuation was not clear.
is worth noting that in the applicants’ written submissions on the
interpretation of “value of imputation credits”,
they said that
“[c]ritically, an appropriate return is one that would induce the
investor to invest in the benchmark business over other
alternatives, and the text and structure of the NER confirm that this is
necessarily a market-based measure” (emphasis added). This was in the same
context as that of the example quoted at length
above, viz. the return required
by investors taking their personal circumstances into account.
this is indicative of neither the AER nor the applicants having a thoroughly
consistent view of how market values are in fact
was missing in the submissions to the Tribunal was a clear analytical exposition
of the economic principles that would lead inexorably
from the theory underlying
the whole PTRM to the contended-for means of estimating the value of imputation
credits. In particular,
the applicants’ argument essentially rests on a
claim that the required rate of return must be reduced by the average value
across all investors of imputation credits, together with the claim that
drop-off studies provide a good estimate of that value.
Nor was the argument put
by Counsel for the AER in oral submissions in a manner which showed it to be
consistent with the PTRM framework.
said, there are multiple instances of where the estimation of parameters
necessarily departs from what would be strictly in accord
with the Officer
framework, for example, because data is unavailable. This means that judgments
need to be made to achieve a reasonable
level of consistency, knowing that
complete consistency is impossible.
seems likely that understanding how the required rate of return should be
determined requires a view of how market prices are set,
and certain that a
consistent framework needs to be applied to both the rate of return and the
value of imputation credits, since
they are not merely related issues but part
of the same issue.
is unfortunate that the materials before us do not allow us to reach a final
view about those relationships, and more so that the
Rules do not appear to be
based on any comprehensive analysis of how these things precisely fit together.
It may be that the unsettled
nature of some issues would prevent that anyway.
We accept that the marginal vs average question is not one to be taken further
in these proceedings. Fortunately, that is not an impediment to reaching a view
on the grounds for review. The key is the AER’s
reasoning as set out in
its Final Decisions, and the processes though which it went that are revealed

we return to the applicants’ contentions.
applicants’ submissions were largely, as explained above, in terms of
economic principle: that a correct interpretation

referred to above, the applicants naturally placed great weight on the
decision, which clearly and directly accepted their
interpretation of “value of imputation credits”, that the value of
theta should be estimated by the drop-off methodology, and that in those
decisions the AER erred in not finding that the value of
theta is that for which
they contend in these proceedings. The AER submitted that in those proceedings,
at that time subject to
pending judicial review, the Tribunal was in error.
Nevertheless,
a statement made at [1088] in
is of interest:
The New Zealand decision in
International Airport Ltd and others v Commerce Commission
[2013] NZHC 3289]
suggests that financial modelling may not yet have produced a workable version
of a CAPM that incorporates a generalised treatment
of imputation credits, in
which case the AER would necessarily have to make judgements about whether and
how to the modify the methodology
in the RoR Guideline for factors subsequently
raised in advice it received from experts.
a similar vein, in
the Tribunal said, at [156]:
In conclusion, the Tribunal is of the view, reflected in
the diversity of expert opinion, that there is no generally accepted theoretical
model for explaining the valuation of imputation credits. There is broad
agreement across experts that the existence of the imputation
system lowers, to
some degree, the cost of equity capital to Australian, domestically operating,
companies, relative to a classical
tax system. That is, required returns
ignoring imputation credits (ie expected cash dividends plus capital gains) will
be lower if
imputation credits are expected to be attached to cash
these proceedings, the Tribunal does not seek to pronounce authoritatively on
the economic chain of logic involved in determining
how best to estimate the
value of imputation credits in terms of r 6.5.3 in the light of r 6.5.2(d)(2).
Rather, it is of the view
that the approach of the AER was open to it, in the
sense that no (limited) merits review grounds have been made out. That is
with the Full Court’s decision.
AER had three possible estimation approaches – no-one suggested any others
– and considered them all carefully. It
used expert economic advice
appropriately. It did not accept advice unquestioningly, but used it as an aid
to its own analysis and
decision-making. This was evident from the extensive
discussion in the Final Decisions.
economic advice of Gray, the consultant responsible for carrying out the
dividend drop-off study was that it was the appropriate
approach. There is
nothing to suggest that that advice was anything but careful and professional.
But the AER had strong advice to
the contrary.
advice was directly to the point, came from two sources, and was unequivocal. In
particular, it dealt carefully with the ambiguities
in Officer’s original
paper, and resolved them in the way that the AER followed. Moreover, the Final
Decisions devote almost
12 pages to a detailed analysis of Gray’s comments
on a number of issues. It could not be said that the AER did not consider
sides of the argument.
these proceedings, the Tribunal accepts that the AER was entitled to come to the
view that, through their underpinning by the Officer
framework, the Rules
require that the value of imputation credits be measured before investor taxes
and costs. As noted above, that
is accepted by the applicants. The expert advice
relied upon by the AER is clear. Thus, for the purposes of this limited merits
the Tribunal finds that the AER did not err in its interpretation of
“value of imputation credits”.
Tribunal accepts that the expert advice is that “before investor taxes and
costs” means that the value of imputation
credits is to be estimated
before allowing for the impact of those taxes and costs. Market studies and, in
particular, the dividend
drop-off study relied upon by the applicants, do not
meet that requirement. The very thing they seek to do is measure the value of
imputation credits to the investor after taking account of the investor’s
costs and liability for taxes. This position is also
explicitly supported by
Handley and Lally.
Tribunal concludes, therefore, that the AER made no error in its overall
related matters, the Tribunal considers that the AER was likewise entitled to
take into account its concern that dividend
drop-off studies may not measure the
value of imputation credits to investors in a way that is referable to the rate
of return required
by investors under the Rules, and in a way that ensures the
consistency required by r 6.5.2(d)(2). The contrary position, in the
Tribunal’s view, involves too cavalier a view that market estimates of
rates of return and market estimates of the value of
imputation credits are
automatically consistent, without regard to the characteristics of the market
participants in each case.
the light of its expert advice, the AER was also entitled to take into account
its reservations about the dividend-drop-off study
itself. It might be noted
that this is an area – the characteristics and limitations of a
particular, highly technical estimation
methodology – where expert advice
is necessary.
a consequence, the Tribunal considers that the AER made no error in applying the
weighting it did to the market studies approach.
The Tribunal’s further conclusions
leaves only the question whether the AER’s use of the equity ownership and
tax statistics approaches was flawed by error
of the kind available on this
limited merits review. The Tribunal considers it was not.
Tribunal finds no error in the manner in which the AER used data for listed
equity and all equity. Its approach was not precluded,
but rather was
reasonable, thorough and clearly explained.
Tribunal accepts that an estimate chosen from within a range of equity ownership
proportions cannot be an upper bound on the best
estimate of gamma. The same is
true of an estimate derived from tax statistics.
AER made no relevant error in its choice of the period over which it considered
equity ownership data. That approach was open
to it, and as explained by it,
reasonable.
AER made no relevant error in choosing the estimate that it did from within the
equity ownership range. Its manner of choice,
as described in its Final
Decisions, was clearly open to it.
reliability of the tax statistics is unclear. The applicants were able to point
to evidence in the relevant source, the Hathaway
paper, that supported their
view that gamma could be reliably estimated from data for credits created and
credits redeemed.
created data comes from companies franking account balances. Credits redeemed
data comes from tax returns. Certainly, the
AER showed that the tax return data
cannot be comprehensive.
AER pointed out that the table in which the credits redeemed figure appears
shows it as deriving from the unreliable dividend
data. That is a conundrum. In
considering whether a limited merits review ground has been made out, the
Tribunal considers that the
AER did not err by accepting Hathaway’s clear
injunctions not to use the data for the purpose that the applicants seek to use
it. The AER’s position was also supported by Handley and Lally.
follows that the AER did not err in giving some reduced weight to tax
statistics; nor did it err in the manner in which it took
them into account, as
set out in detail in its Final Decisions.
Tribunal considers the AER’s analysis of submissions regarding the effect
of the 45-day holding rule to have been fair and
careful. While it is not
possible to be certain that the impact of the rule is immaterial, no evidence
was put before the Tribunal
to quantify the effect or show that it is material.
There is no basis for making an adjustment to the estimate of gamma.
Tribunal finds no reviewable error in the AER’s Final Decisions on

to index the

do not mandate use of the PTRM as the
do, in practice the
AER does use the PTRM in relation to gas service providers under the gas regime
in the same way as it uses it
under the electricity regime, because, the AER
require a similar building block approach as the
to determine allowed revenue, and the PTRM implements such an approach. This
practice is accepted by ActewAGL.
impact is that, the higher the estimate of forecast inflation, the lower the
service provider’s allowed revenue.
forecast inflation estimation methodology used in versions of the PTRM since
2008 has been a geometric average of annual estimates
over 10 years using the
latest available forecasts from the Statement of Monetary Policy published by
the Reserve Bank of Australia
(RBA) for the first two or three years (the number
can vary depending on when the RBA forecasts become available in relation to the
start of the access arrangement period), and the mid-point of the RBA’s
target inflation band for each of the remaining seven
or eight years. That
mid-point is 2.5 per cent.
inflation in recent years has been low: significantly lower than 2.5 per
its access arrangement proposal, ActewAGL calculated forecast inflation using
the AER’s approach described above. However,
it also said that,
“expectations concerning inflation appear to be volatile and it may be
that the best method for estimating
inflation may evolve during the period that
our revenue proposal is being considered”.
The statutory framework in respect of forecast
governed the procedure for the submission of an access
arrangement by a service provider and the AER’s decision regarding the
access arrangement.
procedure included the following (relevant) steps:
arrangement proposal must be submitted under r 46, complying with the access
arrangement information requirements in r 42.
Under r 59, the AER must make
an access arrangement draft decision on the proposal.
The relevant parts of r
of access arrangement proposal in response to draft decision
(1) The service provider may, within the
revision period, submit additions or other amendments to the
arrangement proposal
to address matters raised in the access arrangement
(2) The amendments must be limited to those necessary to address matters raised
in the access arrangement draft
unless the AER approves further
amendments.
The AER might approve amendments to the
access arrangement proposal

since submission of the
access arrangement
Under r 62 the AER must make an access arrangement final decision.
64(1) provided that if, in an access arrangement final decision, the AER refused
to approve an access arrangement proposal, it
must itself propose an access
arrangement or revisions to the access arrangement for the relevant pipeline. By
r 64(2), the arrangement
was to be formulated with regard to the matters

provider’s access arrangement proposal; and the AER’s reasons
refusing to approve that proposal. Although the AER may consult on its proposal,
it was not obliged to do so: r 64(3).

regulated pipeline and the tariffs derived from that revenue.

arrangement proposal. In particular, r 72(1)(m) required
the information to
include the total revenue to be derived from pipeline services for each
regulatory year of the access arrangement
73(1) specified that financial information must be provided on a nominal basis;
or a real basis; or some other recognised basis
for dealing with the effects of
inflation. Rule 73(3) specified that all financial information had to be
provided, and all calculations
made, consistently on the same basis.
74(1) provided that information in the nature of a forecast or estimate had to
be supported by a statement of the basis of the
forecast or estimate. Rule 74(2)
provided that a forecast or estimate had to be arrived at on a reasonable basis
and represent the
best forecast or estimate possible in the circumstances.
76 provided that total revenue was to be determined for each regulatory year
using the building block approach. The building
blocks included, relevantly, (a)
a return on the projected capital base for the year and (b) depreciation on the
projected capital
base for the year.
calculation of the depreciation building block was addressed in rr 88 and 89.
Rule 88 provided that the depreciation schedule
set out the basis on which the
pipeline assets constituting the capital base were to be depreciated for the
purpose of determining
a reference tariff. Rule 89(1)(d) provided that the
depreciation schedule should be designed:
... so that (subject to the rules about capital
redundancy), an asset is depreciated only once (ie that the amount by which the
is depreciated over its economic life does not exceed the value of the
asset at the time of its inclusion in the capital base (adjusted,
accounting method approved by the AER permits, for
inflation))...
89(3) provided: “The AER’s discretion under this rule is
limited.” Rule 40(2) provided that where the AER’s
discretion under
a particular rule was limited, then the AER may not withhold its approval to an
element of an access arrangement
proposal that was governed by the relevant
provision if the AER was satisfied that it:

, r 6.4.3 provided that the annual revenue requirement for a
service provider must be determined using a building block approach,
under which
building blocks include: indexation of the regulatory asset base; a return on
capital for that year; and depreciation
for that year (plus some other building
blocks not presently relevant). The rule went on to specify, by reference to
other rules,
how the indexation of the capital base was to be calculated, and
stated that the indexation of the regulatory asset building block
was a negative
adjustment of that amount: see r 6.4.3(b)(1)(ii). Thus, the capital base was
indexed each year, and the return on
capital was calculated on that indexed
amount, but the amount of the indexation was deducted from the annual revenue
requirement
by creating a negative building block of the amount of indexation.
did not make explicit mention of indexation of the capital base or
provision for a negative building block. Rather, the deduction
was, as a matter
of practice, made by deduction of the amount of forecast inflation (indexation)
from the depreciation building block
provided for in r 76 and addressed in rr 88
and 89, referred to at [368]-[369] above. There was no dispute about this

whether it should change the approach. It said that, in response, stakeholders
the continuation of the current approach and it was therefore satisfied
that the current approach was the appropriate approach for
this (draft)
determination. The AER updated ActewAGL’s original estimate using the
latest data, giving an estimate of 2.5 per
cent (this being the geometric
average of ten annual estimates).
AER said it would consider a change to inflation forecasting if it was endorsed
by stakeholders as part of a comprehensive consultation
process, and that the
next rate of return guideline review may be such a suitable process for
reviewing the inflation forecasting
its revised access arrangement in response to the AER’s draft decision,
ActewAGL departed from the prior method and proposed
an estimate of 2.19 per
cent. This estimate was based on its consultant’s, CEG’s,
application of the “breakeven
approach”. In a submission on 12 May
2016 ActewAGL put forward an updated estimate of 1.96 per cent.
AER rejected that approach and forecast in its Final Decision of 26 May 2016,
maintained its existing approach, as it had done
in accepting ActewAGL’s
initial proposal in its draft decision, and updated the estimate again, arriving
at a figure of 2.18
per cent. This was intended to be the geometric average of
the RBA’s forecasts of 1.0 per cent for 2015-16, 2.0 per cent for
and 2.0 per cent for 2017-18, and of 2.5 per cent, being the midpoint of the
RBA’s target range, for each of the seven
years 2018-25. In the process of
its deliberations, the Tribunal noted that the AER had incorrectly calculated
this geometric average
based on the RBA’s forecasts. The correct average
is 2.25 per cent. The AER acknowledged this error in its supplementary
submissions
of 3 July 2017, and noted:
The Tribunal itself does not have the power to correct
the error, as no ground of review is raised in relation to it. In those
circumstances,
the appropriate course is for the AER to consider, once the
Tribunal has delivered its determination, whether to exercise its power
NER 6.13 and NGR 68. Under those rules, the AER must consult with the service
providers affected and such other persons as
the AER considers appropriate (NER
6.13(d) / NGR 68(d)).
Tribunal accepts this and, given the conclusion to follow that the AER made no
(methodological) error in its determination, leaves
it to the AER to determine
the appropriate response to its error. The balance of this discussion refers to
the AER's originally determined
2.18 per cent figure.
AER considered its current method to be reasonable because:

revised access arrangement proposal and in its late
submission. This was because
the AER did not consider CEG’s application of the breakeven approach

bias. Further, the AER did not consider that a
breakeven approach using indexed Commonwealth Government Securities (
would necessarily produce better estimates of expected inflation than the
current method (or another estimation method, such as
one based on inflation
swaps). The AER said:
Moreover, even if we considered an alternative approach
could be preferable (which we do not), the method for estimating expected
inflation should apply to all service providers as inflation expectations are
not business-specific. As such, any change in approach
should only be considered
following broad consultation with all stakeholders, rather than within a single

aspect of ActewAGL’s proposed access
arrangement.
(Footnote omitted.)
The errors claimed by ActewAGL to have been made by the
nub of ActewAGL’s claim regarding error was that:
under r 89 the
AER’s discretion was limited;
taken together,
rr 40(2) and 74(2) required the AER to accept the breakeven forecasting
methodology unless it was positively satisfied
that the methodology was not
arrived at on a reasonable basis and did not represent the best forecast
possible in the circumstances;
the AER could
not properly have been so satisfied because there was cogent evidence regarding
the breakeven methodology to the contrary,
and that the AER’s methodology
was unlikely to provide an accurate forecast in the prevailing market
conditions.
also claimed that the AER adopted a presumption that its methodology should
continue unless the breakeven methodology was
established to necessarily produce
better estimates; and that it had had regard to irrelevant considerations
regarding the need for
any change to be made in the light of broad industry
consultation, the desirability for the methodology to be consistent across gas
and electricity service providers, and whether the methodology was simple,
transparent and easily replicated.
errors were also alleged to the effect that the AER’s decision was
unreasonable or involved incorrect exercise of discretion
in the face of
evidence regarding interest rates and inflation.
claimed errors were alternatively formulated in terms of errors of fact –
e.g. that the AER wrongly concluded that its
methodology was arrived at on a
reasonable basis and represented the best forecast possible – or as being
incorrect or as being
unreasonable. The applicant not having clearly
distinguished errors of fact from incorrect exercises of discretion or
unreasonableness,
there is no utility in the Tribunal trying to do so before it
considers the substance of the claims.
The applicant’s submissions
submitted that there was no inconsistency in proposing the use of the PTRM to
calculate its allowed revenue but departing
from the current inflation
forecasting methodology. The AER’s current inflation forecasting
methodology was not part of the
PTRM. An inflation forecasting methodology was
merely an input to the PTRM.
said that the AER’s decision in respect of inflation forecasting was
clearly “governed” by r 89, and specifically
r 89(1)(d), since there
was no other power under which to make a deduction from the annual revenue
requirement. It said that the
AER did not appear to appreciate in its Final
Decision that this invoked the limited discretion provision in r 40. The Final
made no mention of the issue.
Counsel for ActewAGL accepted that ActewAGL had not raised the question of
limited discretion during the processes leading
up to the Final Decision.

relied on as supporting both its view that r 89 governed the AER’s
decision and its interpretation of being

reference to the comments made in the Final Decision, ActewAGL argued that the
AER had made a presumption in favour of the existing
inflation forecasting
methodology, which was not open to it. It had not actively turned its mind to
whether ActewAGL’s proposed
forecasting methodology was arrived at on a
reasonable basis and represented the best forecast possible in the
circumstances.
it had had regard to prohibited
considerations, viz. its view of the
desirability of applying the same methodology to all service providers (as
inflation expectations
are not business-specific) and for considering a change
only following broad consultation with all stakeholders.
argued that the AER should not have concluded that its forecast was accurate.
It claimed that the Final Decision was premised
on two conclusions that
constituted findings of fact:
inflation forecast for the 2015-21 period of 2.18 per cent, based on the
AER’s forecasting methodology, represented
the likely rate of inflation
over that period; and
inflation forecast proposed by ActewAGL in its Revised Proposal (based on the
Breakeven Forecasting Methodology) for the
2015-21 period of 2.19 per cent, and
updated on 12 May 2016 to 1.96 per cent, did not represent the likely rate of
inflation over
that period.
the AER’s methodology, by far the greatest contributor to the forecast of
inflation was the mid-point of the RBA’s
target range for the last seven
years of its forecast (following the RBA’s forecast for the first three
years). ActewAGL submitted
that the AER’s reasoning provided scant
evidence in support of the predictive power of the methodology, because times
had changed.
The fact that since 1993 the average annualised inflation rate had
been close to the 2.5 per cent mid-point was irrelevant. Reliance
on the target
range mid-point assumed that investors perceived an equal likelihood that the
RBA would be unable, over the medium
term, to prevent above-target inflation as
below-target inflation.
drew upon a report by CEG of June 2015, which it said:
explained that current market conditions were not such
that inflation could be assumed to have equal probability of being above as
below the mid-point of the RBA’s inflation target range. CEG observed that
monetary policy loses its power to lift inflation
interest rate approaches zero. CEG presented evidence that inflation has been
consistently below target
levels in all developed countries, including
Australia, and explained why, in this context, inflation was likely continue to
RBA targets in the short to medium term (certainly more likely than
inflation rising above the mid-point of the RBA's target range),
and that there
was a risk of Australia falling into a ‘low inflation trap’. Having
regard to that evidence, the AER’s
claim that its Forecasting Methodology
was ‘unlikely to be subject to estimation error’ was insupportable.
referred to a series of statements by the RBA to the effect that, at current
levels, lower interest rates were not stimulating
economic activity to the same
extent as historically. Similarly, CEG referred to statements in the financial
press in May 2016 that
echoed the IMF’s 2015 concerns regarding Australia
falling into a low inflation trap as a result of interest rates approaching
‘zero lower bound’.
its May 2016 submission providing the updated forecast of 1.96 per cent, CEG
observed that actual inflation remained persistently
low. It noted that the
AER’s forecasting methodology assumed that even though inflation had
averaged 1.3 per cent over the
though the centre of the RBA forecast range was 2.0 per cent for the next two
years, investors expected inflation to then immediately jump from 2.0
per cent to 2.5 per cent (i.e. the mid-point of the AER’s
target inflation
band) in the year ended June 2019. There was no reasonable basis for that
assumption (and certainly none advanced
by the AER in the Final Decision).
AER did not, so ActewAGL argued, attempt a meaningful analysis of the prevailing
low interest rates and the efficacy of monetary
policy, issues which it
acknowledged in its Final Decision:
If monetary policy loses or is perceived to have lost
its effectiveness in influencing economic activity, inflation expectations may
deviate systematically from the mid-point of the inflation target range. In
which case, estimates under this approach may be too
high or too low relative to
the market inflation expectations.
The current approach is more likely than market-based estimates to be
inconsistent with the term structure of inflation observed
in the market because
it is not based on the market-implied forward inflation curve. This raises the
risk that estimates of the real
risk free rate may depart from the
‘true’ real risk free rate in the market.
proposed methodology involved comparisons between fixed interest rate CGS and
inflation-indexed CGS to estimate expectations
of inflation in the market. It
used economic theory in the form of the Fisher equation. At a particular
inflation rate, which can
be calculated, all other things being equal, the two
ActewAGL’s submission, this methodology can be viewed as the
probability-weighted forecast of inflation in all possible circumstances
market participants perceive. Being determined by market prices for bonds, it
reflected the views of bond market investors
who had a financial investment in
forecasting inflation accurately, and whose expectations were embedded in the
risk-free rate and
cost of debt estimates used by the AER to determine the cost
of equity and debt.
oral submissions, Senior Counsel for ActewAGL particularly drew attention to
comparisons made by CEG of estimates of inflation
for the year to December 2015
and the year to March 2016, made using the breakeven method, and those produced
by the AER’s
methodology, i.e. forecasts by the RBA made in November 2014
and February 2015.
submitted that the AER’s stated concerns about the breakeven methodology,
viz, that they contained potential biases:
relied only on
“preliminary research”;
did not attempt
to quantify (or otherwise assess the significance of) the supposed liquidity
premium bias, did not have regard to
its previously held view that a lack of
supply of indexed CGS meant that their yield was biased downwards (thereby
overstating breakeven
inflation), and did not have proper regard to the fact
that the very significant increase in indexed CGS on issue since 2008 suggested
that any bias (in either direction) was likely to be small;
acknowledged
that any inflation risk premium was more likely to result in the breakeven
methodology over-estimating inflation;
consider an overall direction of bias or to consider why those biases could be
expected to be more material than the evidence
before it which demonstrated that
inflation was likely to be materially lower than forecast by the AER’s
forecasting methodology
and the mid-point of the RBA’s target band for
inflation after two years; and
consider evidence of the dramatic fall in breakeven inflation between December
2015 and the time of the AER’s Final
Decision (from 2.22 per cent in
December 2015 to 1.64 per cent on 6 May 2016, a fall of 0.58 per cent) and that
this was unlikely
to be wholly attributable to an increase in the level of
overriding submission, returned to at all times, was that the AER presumed that
its forecasting methodology would
apply unless and until dislodged by another
methodology, which was an error, as described above.
also submitted that the AER’s Final Decision involved an incorrect
exercise of discretion or was unreasonable in that
the AER failed to properly
consult with and inform ActewAGL of the deficiencies it perceived with the
breakeven methodology. In
this regard, it was submitted, the AER contravened s
28(1)(b)(i) of the
, which provided that:
(1) The AER must, in performing or exercising an AER
economic regulatory function or power—
(a) perform or exercise that function or
power in a manner that will or is likely to contribute to the achievement of the
gas objective; and
(b) if the AER is making a designated reviewable regulatory decision—
(i) ensure that—
(A) the covered pipeline service provider that provides the pipeline services to
which the applicable access arrangement decision
will apply; and
(B) users or prospective users of the pipeline services that the AER considers
have an interest in the matter; and
(C) any user or consumer associations or user or consumer interest groups that
the AER considers have an interest in the matter,
are, in accordance with the Rules—
(D) informed of the material issues under consideration by the AER; and
(E) given a reasonable opportunity to make submissions in respect of the
decision before it is
it was submitted, a failure to accord procedural fairness had the consequence
that the AER’s decision was unreasonable
in all the circumstances.
described later in these reasons, the AER submitted that r 60, set out at [362]
above, precluded ActewAGL from changing the inflation
forecasting methodology in
its initial access arrangement proposal. ActewAGL submitted that the AER
appeared to have assumed that
if the break-even forecasting methodology was not
proposed in ActewAGL’s initial access arrangement proposal, then by
of r 60 the AER cannot have made an error of the kind specified in s
by not adopting or even considering, on its
interpretation, the break-even forecasting methodology.
pointed out that the AER did not rely upon (or indeed mention) r 60 in its Final
Decision to argue that ActewAGL had had
no ability to revise the inflation
forecasting methodology between its initial proposal and its revised proposal.
In fact, the AER
had “purported” to consider ActewAGL’s
breakeven methodology proposal.
submitted that r 60 was procedural, and did not provide for any consequence if a
service provider submitted additions or
other amendments to an access
arrangement proposal. It was not concerned with grounds of review that may
legitimately be pursued.
The AER did not oppose leave, and the Tribunal had
given leave. A provision of the
could not be elevated to limit the
Tribunal’s otherwise properly invoked jurisdiction.
submitted that r 74 contained an unqualified requirement that whatever forecast
was used must represent the best possible
forecast or estimate in the
circumstances. That requirement was not limited by forecasting methodologies
proposed in an access arrangement
any event, ActewAGL submitted, even if r 60 limited the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal, which ActewAGL submitted it did not, then
ActewAGL did not contravene
the rule because the breakeven methodology was in fact proposed to address a
matter “raised in
the access arrangement draft decision”. The word
“raised” in r 60(1) was not a word that should be construed narrowly
in circumstances where many economic and business variables might move between
the making of an initial access arrangement draft
decision and the final
decision. Also, matters under consideration by the AER in a draft decision
involved many complex and interconnected
decisions and it might not be apparent
or clear at the time of the draft decision that a restrictive construction of r
60 would not
promote the NGO.

ought to be interpreted to mean no more than a requirement

whether the draft decision would, if
it were a Final Decision, be in accordance

its adoption of the AER’s forecasting methodology was contingent. The

ActewAGL contended that by advancing the breakeven methodology in its revised

position taken in its initial proposal.

Without expressing a conclusion on whether
any of those contentions were new,
that proposition being resisted by the AER, the Tribunal granted leave to
ActewAGL to make short

reply was dated 2 December 2016. One submission addressed the proposition put by
the AER in oral address that the
AER and ActewAGL were essentially in agreement
ActewAGL altered its position by proposing a lower estimate in May 2016.
ActewAGL said that this submission was incorrect. A second
matter addressed by
ActewAGL was as to whether or not ActewAGL’s proposed inflation estimate
fell outside r 89. The AER had
submitted that ActewAGL’s estimate was not
governed by r 89. A third matter addressed by ActewAGL was as to the meaning of
the word “best” in the context of a forecast. The fourth matter went
to the AER’s criticisms of ActewAGL’s
expert, Dr Hird of CEG, and as
to the substance of the matters with which he dealt. The fifth matter addressed
the position if the
AER’s decision about ActewAGL’s estimate of
inflation was not subject to r 40(2). ActewAGL emphasised that this was a
peripheral issue: if the AER’s discretion to reject ActewAGL’s
estimate was limited by r 40(2) (as ActewAGL contended
that it was), then the
question of the criteria by which the AER was to make its own proposed estimate
of inflation did not arise
for consideration.
was subsequent correspondence from the solicitors for the AER dated 9 December
2016. That letter stated the AER did not seek
to put on further submissions in
response to ActewAGL’s reply submissions dated 2 December 2016. However,
the AER requested
that the Tribunal note that, in its view, the circumstances
did not give rise to any need for ActewAGL to approach its reply in the
in which it did. There was then a further letter from the solicitors for
ActewAGL to the Tribunal, dated 13 December 2016.
It is not necessary for the
Tribunal to address that correspondence. To the extent necessary, we do consider
below ActewAGL’s
written reply submissions dated 2 December
The AER’s submissions
AER’s first submission was that ActewAGL had been precluded from advancing
a new method of estimating expected inflation
by r 60. ActewAGL had submitted
its initial access arrangement proposal using the PTRM, including the inflation
estimation method
contained within it. The use of this method was accepted by
the AER in its draft decision, which thus did not raise a matter that
basis for an amendment to the inflation estimation method in the revised
statement in its initial access arrangement proposal that the best method of
estimating inflation may evolve during
the regulatory process did not permit it
to avoid the operation of the
. It was required to request the AER to
exercise its discretion to allow it to amend its approach.
AER did not refer to r 60 in deciding that it would not accept ActewAGL’s
revised inflation methodology. Nevertheless, ActewAGL
never requested the AER to
exercise its discretion under r 60.
the AER’s submission, r 60 reflected the important policy consideration
that the service provider should place all its cards
on the table in its initial
proposal, which was subject to a consultation process with users before the
draft decision was made.
Raising new matters after the draft decision bypassed
that consultation process, and there was no practical need to do so, since
five years between new access arrangements provided ample time for a considered
proposal to be put forward.
figure of 2.18 per cent in the Final Decision was insignificantly different from
the 2.19% in ActewAGL’s revised access
arrangement proposal (in response
to the draft decision). It was only on 12 May, two weeks before the Final
Decision, that ActewAGL
sought to further revise its estimate to 1.96 per cent.
The time for submissions to be made had expired on 6 January.
AER denied that the limited discretion rule was applicable. However, if it was
applicable, it was complied with, because the AER
was not satisfied that the
estimate derived using the Fisher equation had been arrived at on a reasonable
basis and was the best
forecast or estimate in the circumstances, whereas it had
that satisfaction about the PTRM method.
particular, ActewAGL had failed to address the known biases and issues
arising because Treasury Bonds were more volatile than Treasury Indexed Bonds;
the inflation
risk premium applied to Treasury Bonds;
the liquidity
premium applied to Treasury Indexed Bonds, as the less liquid asset; and
indexation lag, which was estimated by the RBA to be around 4.5 to 5.5 months.
issues and the CEG report were discussed in the Final Decision, where the AER
explained why it considered that the CEG report
had not adequately dealt with
earlier concerns expressed by its author.
issues concerning potential biases were known from the academic literature
referred to in the Final Decision and in the findings
and advice provided in
2008, when the AER, following a process of consultation, adopted its current
methodology in preference to
the breakeven approach. The draft decision had
noted that in its recent rate of return guideline development process the AER
raised the inflation forecasting method as an issue for potential review. In
response, stakeholders had endorsed the continuation
of the current approach. It
was therefore significant that ActewAGL and CEG had not sought to address the
issues in the revised access
arrangement proposal and associated
submissions.
AER’s conclusion – that it did not accept ActewAGL’s approach
because it did not consider CEG’s application
of the breakeven approach
appropriately adjusted for bias – constituted a finding for the purposes
r 40(2) that the estimate of expected inflation produced using the
inflation estimation method proposed by ActewAGL did not comply
r 74 because the estimate was not arrived at on a reasonable basis and did not
represent the best forecast or estimate possible in
the circumstances.
AER argued that the material in the CEG report and ActewAGL’s submissions
regarding actual inflation outcomes – by
necessity, in the past –
were not to the point. The question was what methodology was best for
forecasting inflation.
argued that there was no basis for apparent claims in the CEG report that the
RBA had lost control of monetary policy. To
the contrary, the very RBA statement
quoted by CEG contained the following:
Nonetheless we do not think that monetary policy has
reached the point where it has no ability at all to give additional support to
demand. Our judgement is that it still has some ability to assist the
transition the economy is making, and we regarded it as appropriate
that support.
RBA Governor Stevens, Opening Statement to House of Representatives Standing
Committee on Economics, Sydney - 13 February 2015.
AER pointed to its statements in the Final Decision, referred to at [215] and
following above, on why it considered the PTRM methodology
to be reasonable. It
also noted throughout the Final Decision that there was no better method for
estimating future inflation, and
that it therefore represented the best method,
as required by r 74.
it submitted:
In order to consider whether an estimate has been
arrived at on a reasonable basis and is the best possible in the circumstances,
it is appropriate to take account of all circumstances that might inform whether
a particular estimate is the best. The fact that
a proposed method is not
widely accepted and departs from established regulatory practice, has not been
the subject of broad consultation
in circumstances where it is an industry-wide
method for an economy-wide indicator and has not been able to be subject to a
comprehensive
analysis of its strengths and weaknesses, are all circumstances
that can legitimately inform that assessment.
to the applicability of the limited discretion rule, the AER submitted that the
inflation forecast methodology was governed (the
term used in r 40(2)) not by r
89, which dealt with depreciation criteria and was a limited discretion rule,
but by rr 73 and 74,
which were not limited discretion rules. Rule 73 expressly
dealt with inflation. Rule 74 required that the forecast must be supported
statement of the basis of the forecast.
methodology was relevant to a number of the integers making up the PTRM, which
was used by ActewAGL to calculate total revenue,
not just depreciation. In fact,
the Final Decision dealt with forecast inflation in the chapter on rate of
return, not that on depreciation.
Rule 89 dealt with how depreciation schedules
were designed, and that was what the limited discretion applied to. A
depreciation
schedule must ensure that assets were depreciated only once, but
the rule did not mandate a particular method by which inflation
estimated, or even that it be estimated.
the AER’s discretion was not limited, then under r 40 it may withhold its
approval to an element of an access arrangement
proposal if, in its opinion, a
preferable alternative existed that complied with the requirements of the
AER submitted that there was no failure to consult with ActewAGL in accordance
with s 28 of the
. ActewAGL could not have been surprised that
the AER approved its proposal to use the PTRM forecast inflation methodology in
draft decision. In subsequently proposing a different methodology, ActewAGL
must have known it was raising a new issue and that it
would consequently have
to advance all relevant information in support of its change. The AER considered
the material provided and
came to its Final Decision.
r 64(1), if the AER, in a final decision, refused to approve an access
arrangement proposal, it must itself propose an access
arrangement or revisions
to the access arrangement. Rule 64(3) provided that it may, but was not obliged
to, consult on its proposal.
AER drew attention to statements by the Tribunal in previous cases about the
detailed sequence involved in the regulatory process
to avoid gaming, and that
“a line must be drawn by the AER in its engagement with a DNSP” so
as to meet deadlines imposed
on it. The AER also referred to the Tribunal having
previously recognised that failure to accord procedural fairness was not an
ground of review.
The Tribunal’s analysis
Was ActewAGL precluded from making amendments to
its initial access arrangement proposal?
Tribunal considers that the effect of r 60 is clearly to constrain the behaviour
of the service provider during the regulatory
decision-making process. It
accepts the submissions of the AER as to the policy intention regarding that
constraint, and respectfully
agrees with the comments of the Tribunal in the
previous cases cited by the AER.
to the submissions of ActewAGL, the rule, while procedural, does have
consequences for the service provider. It does not
include sanctions for
non-compliance, but it is intended to be complied with, and to foster an orderly
process in which the scope
to amend an initial access arrangement proposal is
limited and, unless required in order to address a matter raised in the
draft decision, subject to approval by the AER. It disciplines the
service provider into making the most well-considered initial
proposal possible,
conscious that the time for proposing departures from existing methodologies is
the period prior to the draft
decision, during which consultation with
stakeholders takes place.
the Tribunal does not accept ActewAGL’s submissions that the phrase
“raised in the access arrangement draft decision”
interpreted so broadly as to comprehend the mere mention in the draft decision
of issues that require consideration. It
could not be the case that by accepting
ActewAGL’s proposed inflation forecasting methodology, the AER was
the intent is that the service provider be given an opportunity to respond to
matters raised by the draft decision as needing
an amendment to the initial
proposal, and not to allow amendment of that proposal otherwise. For example,
the AER might signal in
its draft decision that it would not accept some element
of the initial proposal unless it was amended. The implication would be
the service provider declined to amend its proposal, it was accepting the
possibility that the AER would reject the initial
proposal and substitute its
own proposal under r 64.
is true that in its draft decision the AER referred to the future possibility of
changing its methodology. In doing so, it was
not raising the methodology as an
issue needing to be addressed by ActewAGL by making amendments to its initial
proposal. It had
accepted that proposal.
may be, as ActewAGL’s submission implies, that there could in some
instances be a degree of trade-off between allowing a
better proposal for making
a forecast or estimate to come forward, on the one hand, and constraining and
confining the decision-making
process, on the other. Rule 60 explicitly
intervenes in that trade-off, on the side of restricting the ability of the
service provider
to make an amendment to its initial proposal – even an
improvement – once the AER has agreed to its initial proposal.
it be thought, as ActewAGL submitted, that such an outcome would be at odds with
finding the “best estimate or forecast possible
circumstances” for the purpose of r 74, it need only be noted that the
circumstances include those brought into effect
by r 60. Of course, if the AER
considered that an otherwise impermissible proposed amendment should be
permitted to be advanced,
it could approve the amendment.
follows that in the Tribunal’s view the AER was entitled to reject
ActewAGL’s amended forecast inflation methodology
as caught by r 60
without giving it further consideration.
the AER did not, in its Final Decision, reject the revised proposal pursuant to
r 60, or even mention r 60. Nor did it oppose
leave for review of the forecast
inflation decision on the basis that ActewAGL had been precluded by r 60 from
making the amendment
(or on any other basis). Instead, it considered the
proposal and subjected it to the analysis that will be described later. It then
rejected it.
these circumstances, the Tribunal does not construe r 60(2) as having the result
that ActewAGL’s amendment to its forecast
inflation methodology is or was
a nullity, or as otherwise having the result that ActewAGL’s amendment
could not or should
not be considered by either the AER or by the Tribunal.
Rather, the Tribunal takes the view, as we have said, that the effect of
was to entitle the AER not to consider such an amendment but,
where, as here, the AER does consider such an amendment, then it has,
implication, approved that further amendment being made in terms of r 60(2). We
reach that conclusion without resort to concepts
of estoppel. It follows that
the Tribunal should consider the consequences, if any, of ActewAGL’s
Was the AER’s discretion limited?
next question is whether the AER’s discretion in making its decision
regarding forecast inflation was limited, and thus
subject to r 40. The only
basis on which that would be the case is if the forecast inflation element of
the access arrangement proposal
is governed by r 89, a limited discretion rule
dealing with depreciation criteria. There is no disagreement that forecast
is an element of ActewAGL’s access arrangement proposal. The
Tribunal was not referred to materials regarding the policy background
or why r 89 is a limited discretion rule. The Tribunal notes that the other
limited discretion rules in Pt 9 of the
, Price and Revenue
Regulation, are those applying to new capital expenditure criteria (r 79),
operating expenditure criteria (r 91)
and tariffs (rr 94 and 95), but not to the
capital base.
relevant part of r 89 is quoted at [368] above
main submission was that there was no other Rule that conferred a power to make
a deduction for inflation from the
annual revenue requirement. The fact that the
inflation forecast entered the PTRM in more than one place was not to the point.
differed from the
(r 6.4.3(b)(1)), which explicitly
required a negative adjustment to the regulatory asset base of the amount of
indexation for inflation.
is to put all the emphasis on the deduction of indexation to prevent
double-counting. But that is not the only or the primary
purpose of making an
inflation forecast. First, in terms of the logic of the building block approach,
the capital base must be indexed
each year to maintain its real value. Secondly,
new capital expenditure must also be indexed to maintain its value in real
Thirdly, to prevent the service provider receiving revenue from the
effect of inflation twice – once through the rate of return
through depreciation – the amount of indexation must be deducted from the
annual revenue requirement.
the Tribunal does not accept that, as Senior Counsel for ActewAGL submitted, the
ground of review is not the inflation forecast
but the deduction
of the inflation indexed component from depreciation, and thus from the annual
revenue requirement. That claim
is contradicted by ActewAGL’s acceptance
of the deduction as a matter of principle, and of its execution through the
depreciation
(return of capital) building block. What ActewAGL objected to is
the AER’s inflation forecast, and the effect of that on the
amount of the
deduction, not the fact of the deduction. If that inflation forecast were to be
changed by the Tribunals’ decision,
it would have effects throughout the
calculation of the annual revenue requirement.
would therefore seem that if the inflation forecast, as an element of an access
arrangement proposal, is governed by r 89 dealing
with how the depreciation
schedule is designed (depreciation criteria), then it must also be governed by
the other Rules under which
it is used in the PTRM or, for that matter, in any
means of deriving the revenue requirement. Rule 78 deals with the projected
base. It makes no mention of inflation, but it makes no mention of
whether the capital base is measured in real or nominal terms.
Under r 87, the
rate of return used is in nominal terms. It follows that the capital base needs
to be indexed to maintain its value
in real terms from year to year. This
adjustment can only be authorised under the
by r 78. It would follow
that the inflation forecast, as an element of the access arrangement proposal,
must also be governed by
inflation forecast would similarly be governed by r 79, which deals with new
capital expenditure criteria during the access arrangement
would be a curious interpretation of the
if the AER’s
discretion to withhold approval of the same inflation forecast was limited in
the case of its use in a depreciation
schedule or new capital expenditure but
not in its use in indexing the capital base.
Tribunal considers that the inflation forecast is not governed by the several
Rules dealing with building blocks in which it plays
a part. Rather, the
inflation forecast is governed by r 74, which deals with forecasts and
issue that the Tribunal’s decision in
dealt with was rather
different, and went to the heart of what r 89 is about. The AER did not address
decision in either its written or its oral submissions.
had sought to make a transition from (1) the method for avoiding
over-compensation for inflation by deducting an amount for indexation
in these proceedings – described in
as the current cost
accounting approach to (2) a historical cost accounting approach. The Tribunal
said that is was well known that
under the historical cost accounting or current
cost accounting approaches the present value of the capital cash flows equals
original asset cost, but with a difference in the time pattern of the
revenue streams over the life of the asset. Assuming the same
depreciation schedule (e.g. straight line depreciation), the historical cost
accounting revenue stream is more “front
end loaded” than the
current cost accounting revenue stream (assuming that inflation is

, the Tribunal nowhere specified what “element of an access
arrangement proposal” was governed by r 79. There was consequently
reference to the deduction for indexation or the historical cost accounting
approaches as an “element”. Rather, the
Tribunal appears to have
considered the element to have been the depreciation schedule or the
depreciation building block. The regulator
in that matter accepted, at [374],
that its discretion was limited, and there appears to have been no dispute or
indeed discussion
in that case about the applicability of r 89 to the
facts, which is unsurprising since the form of the depreciation schedule was
central to the issues involved in considering the grounds of review.
Tribunal acknowledges that the issues in
and in these proceedings
are not unrelated, in that in both cases the treatment of depreciation is
involved, including how to avoid
over-compensation of a service provider by
reason of the relationship between a nominal rate of return being applied to an
inflation-adjusted
capital base. However, its sees nothing in

89(1)(d) is not “about” deducting indexation of the capital base
from depreciation so as to arrive at an annual revenue
requirement that avoids
overcompensation for indexation. It is concerned with not allowing an asset to

permits, for inflation.

that is the accounting method being used. It is
not about deducting

indexation deduction to be made to depreciation in
the PTRM for gas network

for the deduction than does
r 87, which deals with rate of return. Rate of

ActewAGL in its 2 December 2016 written reply submission

case the Tribunal is wrong in its view that the AER’s discretion was not
limited, it now considers the Final Decision under
the assumption that r 40(2)
applies to it.
Does ActewAGL’s inflation methodology comply
with applicable requirements?
Paraphrasing

forecasting methodology:

any) prescribed by the
then it should be accepted by the AER, even if the AER regards its approach as
(merely) preferable.
Tribunal must examine the analysis of the AER in reaching its conclusion of
non-compliance by ActewAGL – i.e. its not being
satisfied that
ActewAGL’s proposal met the requirements – and if that analysis
involves errors of fact, wrongful exercise
of discretion or is unreasonable in
result, reviewable error will result.
applicable requirements of the
are those found in r
74: that a forecast or estimate must be arrived at on a reasonable basis and
must represent the best forecast
or estimate possible in the circumstances.
may be seen that the word “best” implies some form of comparison:
between the best forecast possible and those that
are less good. Thus, while the
AER may not be entitled to reject ActewAGL’s forecast merely because it
thinks its own preferable,
at [386], it is not precluded from
rejecting ActewAGL’s forecast if, on analysis, it forms a well-based view
that its own is
clearly better, for in that case ActewAGL’s forecast could
not be the best possible. On the contrary, in that event the AER
is bound not to
accept ActewAGL’s forecast.
a threshold point, the Tribunal accepts the AER’s submission that its
Final Decision conclusion – that it did not accept
approach because it did not consider CEG’s application of the breakeven
approach appropriately adjusted for
bias – constitutes a finding for the
purposes of r 40(2) of the
that the estimate of expected inflation
produced using the inflation estimation method proposed by ActewAGL did not
comply with r
74 because the estimate was not arrived at on a reasonable basis
and did not represent the best forecast or estimate possible in
circumstances.
the AER’s conclusions in the Final Decision that its methodology was a
better approach constitute a finding that ActewAGL’s
forecast did not
represent the best forecast possible in the circumstances.
question is whether the AER was right so to conclude. Was its reasoning sound,
or does it reveal error? Did it have a reasonable
basis for not being satisfied
that ActewAGL’s forecast was the best possible in the circumstances? This
is the test that ActewAGL’s
counsel ultimately proposed, and that the
Tribunal now applies. The Tribunal’s view is not that which ActewAGL, in
its 2 December
2016 written reply submission, ascribes to the AER, viz. that
“best” has such a wide interpretation that the AER’s
discretion is effectively unlimited.
submitted that the AER appeared not to have realised that its discretion was
limited. ActewAGL had not raised that proposition
with the AER during the
regulatory decision-making process so it is not surprising that the AER’s
Final Decision did not refer
to it in terms. The AER denied that its discretion
was limited, but submitted that if it was, that requirement was complied with.
The Final Decision does not mention the issue of limited discretion, and does
not reveal conscious effort, by the nature and terms
of its drafting, to comply
with r 40. That does not answer the question whether it did comply.
AER spent over six pages discussing the CEG approach and making comparisons with
its existing approach. The Tribunal considers
that the comparison of the two
approaches is fair and balanced and not in error. The AER’s view that
ActewAGL’s forecasting
methodology was deficient was based on an
enumeration of potential biases in the breakeven approach, with in each instance
expressed about whether it would require adjustment to the forecasts
produced, giving references to consultants’ reports (including
author of the CEG report), its own previous decisions, and numerous academic
articles. The CEG report had made no adjustments
for bias to its
analysis was not in depth, but the Tribunal finds it is not accurate to
characterise it as lacking substance. It constituted the
listing of known issues
that needed to be addressed before the AER could reasonably change its mind that
the breakeven methodology
had fundamental flaws.
Tribunal finds that it was known among stakeholders that the breakeven approach
was flawed at the time it was dropped in 2008.
It finds that the author of the
CEG report, in particular, was aware of those issues and had expressed concerns
that it was for ActewAGL to address those concerns in
some detail to explain why they could now be put aside if the approach were
be considered the best possible. It finds that the CEG report did not attempt
such a task except in a broad brush way. It finds
the AER specifically
considered CEG’s comments about what had changed in the market since 2008,
and decided that it could not
be satisfied that there were no longer
assessing the question of statutory error, the Tribunal finds ActewAGL’s
submissions – and the relevant passages in
the CEG report –
unpersuasive as to the relative merits of the two methodologies. The question is
which methodology is likely
to produce the better forecasts. As to the first
three years, the Tribunal heard no evidence to suggest that the official
of the RBA were to be discounted. It might be noted that in making
those forecasts – which are a vital input to market expectations
investment decisions – the RBA would employ a range of methodologies and
market intelligence, no doubt including market
estimation methodologies, of
which the breakeven methodology is one.
claimed loss of efficacy of monetary policy is irrelevant to those medium-term
forecasts, as they are made by the RBA in its full
knowledge of how monetary
policy is operating – a knowledge as good as anyone else’s –
and of likely market developments.
In any case, the Tribunal accepts that no
evidence was produced that the RBA has made a statement to the effect that its
policy interventions are ineffective, and indeed had stated, at the
relevant time, that it still had scope to influence the market.
must turn to the use of the breakeven methodology for the out-years of the
ten-year inflation forecasts versus the use of
the mid-point of the RBA’s
target range. Even three years out, forecast inflation is highly unpredictable.
That much can be
seen by the surprises in the market at inflation being lower
than expected in the recent past. The Tribunal sees no inherent unlikelihood
inflation being 2.5 per cent in 2018-19, as assumed in the AER’s
methodology. The only evidence that such an outcome was
unlikely was that it
would involve inflation increasing from 2.0 per cent the year before. This was
merely asserted to be implausible,
with no evidence regarding, for example, the
frequency or otherwise of such events in the past.
the widely reported intention of monetary authorities in many countries to
encourage inflation to increase, and the historical
coincidence between actual
inflation outcomes and the mid-point of the range, the Tribunal accepts that use
of the RBA’s target
range provides the best possible inflation forecasts
for the time being. Of course, that assessment should be reconsidered by the
from time to time.
may be seen, the Tribunal’s view is tied to the reasoning in the Final
Decision. ActewAGL’s 2 December 2016 written
reply submission regarding
how counsel for the AER dealt with the CEG report does not raise any matters to
disturb the Tribunal’s
following statements in the Final Decision were relied on by ActewAGL as not
being concordant with the AER’s failing to
be satisfied that
ActewAGL’s methodology was the best possible:
... we do not consider that a breakeven approach using
indexed CGSs would necessarily produce better estimates of expected inflation
than the current method (or another estimation method, such a [sic] one based on
inflation swaps).
... we maintain that if we change our view in the future, this should follow a
consultation process and a comprehensive analysis
of the strengths and
weaknesses of different approaches. This will allow us to consistently apply a
methodology for estimating expected
inflation that is broadly accepted as sound.
We consider this to be beneficial over changing approaches across resets (noting
we do not consider service providers have shown broad support to
permanently return to the breakeven approach).
If an alternative to the current method provides unambiguously better estimates
of expected inflation, we consider it preferable
to adopt this as our general
approach rather than applying it on a decision-by-decision basis. We do not
consider CEG or ActewAGL
have made a strong case for how the breakeven approach
might produce superior estimates of expected inflation to the current method.
Further, neither addressed nor proposed to adjust for the potentially material
biases underpinning this approach.
appears to have been making two related points. First, it claimed the passages

its task, which was to reach
satisfaction about whether the breakeven methodology was the best possible.
Secondly, ActewAGL said
that the passages were evidence that the AER had taken
impermissible considerations into account.

explicitly addressed the requirements of r 40. Similar
thoughts are expressed
differently in different places. For example, by comparison with the first
passage above it also said:
Given the information currently before us, we are not
satisfied that changing our approach would improve our estimates of expected
it were the case that the AER had decided merely that ActewAGL’s proposed
methodology was no better than its existing methodology,
then, with a limited
discretion, it could not reject the proposal. But the Tribunal considers it
evident from the substantial comparison
between the two methodologies that the
AER had considerable unaddressed concerns about the breakeven methodology, and
is confident
that the existing methodology is robust, in the sense that it
produces good inflation forecasts. It clearly considered that the existing
methodology was better, and therefore the best possible in the circumstances.
The Tribunal also considers that the AER had a reasonable
basis for reaching
those views.
the AER had decided to reject ActewAGL’s amendment purely on the basis
that industry consultation and broad stakeholder agreement
were needed before it
would implement a change, it is possible that the AER would have been in error.
But that was not the case.
It is clear from the Final Decision that the issue
of bias was paramount.
is also clear that those other considerations were taken into account in making
the decision. The Tribunal considers that the absence
of scrutiny of the
breakeven methodology through broad stakeholder consultation was a justifiable
consideration in whether that methodology
was the best possible.
submitted that the AER made two findings of fact that could not be rationally
inflation forecast for the 2015-21 period of 2.18 per cent, based on the
AER’s forecasting methodology, represented
the likely rate of inflation
over that period; and
inflation forecast proposed by ActewAGL in its Revised AA Proposal (based on the
Breakeven Forecasting Methodology) for
the 2015-21 period of 2.19 per cent, and

they are findings of fact, which the AER denies, is neither here nor there. The
Tribunal considers that, if “more likely”
is substituted for
“likely”, they are deducible propositions from the AER’s
decision that its existing methodology
is superior and the best possible. That
does not further ActewAGL’s argument. The propositions simply crystallise
of choosing one methodology over the other. The reasons for the
choice do not rest on the outcomes produced, as if those outcomes

the AER submits, it does not know what future inflation will be. It has chosen
what it considers the best method for forecasting
it. The point is, in the
Tribunal’s view, that the subject matter is a forecast.
Tribunal finds that the claim that the AER did not actively turn its mind to the
task before it is amply contradicted by the discussion
and detail in the Final
Decision, including references to the submission that it received two weeks
before that decision was published.
It was only in that submission that
ActewAGL’s proposed methodology generated a forecast different from its
previously proposed
2.19 per cent, negligibly different from the AER’s
forecast of 2.18 per cent. The proximity of those estimates is not relevant
our view of the merits of the competing methodologies. Consequently,
ActewAGL’s 2 December 2016 written reply submission
AER’s counsel said about the importance of the proximity is also not
relevant to our view of the merits of the
competing methodologies.
there is the question whether the AER erred by not properly consulting with
ActewAGL and informing it of the potential deficiencies
it perceived with the
breakeven methodology.
Tribunal finds that the AER properly considered the material placed before it by
ActewAGL. It had already approved ActewAGL’s
initial proposal to use the
existing methodology, and ActewAGL consequently needed to provide materials to
support an amended proposal.
It should not have needed to be asked. It cannot be
the case that, in addition to preparing a draft decision under the Rules, the
AER is required to further foreshadow its Final Decision before publishing it,
in an instance where the Final Decision confirms the
draft decision. ActewAGL
was not denied procedural fairness.
summary, the Tribunal finds no ground of review made out in relation to this

), productivity improvements and reliability
benefits. It related specifically to the Victorian jurisdiction and the
installation
in Victoria of smart meters.
historical background was given by the AER in its written submissions in terms
which the Tribunal accepts. In 2006, the Victorian
Government mandated the
rollout of AMI, colloquially referred to as “smart meters”, to all
households and small businesses
across Victoria. Under an Order in Council made
by the former Victorian Minister, Victorian consumers substantially paid for the
rollout of AMI through additional charges on their electricity bills. Whereas
analyses produced in 2009 and 2010 projected very substantial
net benefits of
the AMI rollout, in 2011 Deloitte provided a report to the Victorian government
that forecast a net cost to customers
of $319 million (NPV at 2008).
referred to smart meters as new digital meters that were able to measure usage
in half hourly intervals, to have this data
remotely read, and to enable other
innovative products and services (“smart services”).
described by the AER, during the 2011-15 regulatory control period, incremental
costs associated with implementing and operating
smart meters were regulated
under the AMI Order in Council (AMI OIC). This included costs associated with
new or upgraded IT systems.
With the expiry of the AMI OIC, opex associated with
AMI was to be regulated under the

What the AER decided
AER decided as follows:
B.4.5 Forecast productivity growth
We have applied a zero per cent productivity growth forecast in our estimate of
the overall rate of change. This reflects our expectations
of the forecast
productivity for an efficient service provider in the short to medium term. This
is consistent with Economic Insights'
recommendation to apply zero forecast
productivity growth for other distribution network service providers such as
Ergon Energy.
This is also consistent with our preliminary decision.
Powercor also included forecast productivity growth of zero in its rate of
The Guideline states that we will incorporate forecast productivity in the rate
of change we apply to base opex when assessing opex.
Forecast productivity
growth will be the best estimate of frontier shift.
We consider past performance to be a good indicator of future performance under
a business as usual situation. We have applied forecast
productivity based on
historical data for the electricity transmission and gas distribution industries
where we consider historical
data to be representative of the forecast
To reach our best estimate of forecast productivity we considered Economic
Insights' economic benchmarking, Powercor’s proposal,
our expectations of
the distribution industry in the short to medium term, and observed productivity
outcomes from electricity transmission
and gas distribution industries. We
discuss these further in our preliminary decision.
[The Victorian Energy Consumer and User Alliance] VECUA, however, stated that
our decision to apply zero productivity growth 'is
illogical and is not
supported by the evidence'. It stated that we need to forecast positive
productivity growth for the Victorian
distributors to bring their productivity
back into line with their previous productivity levels and into line with the
electricity transmission, gas distribution and other asset intensive
industry sectors achieve.
VECUA claimed that a key reason for the distributors’ productivity
declines during the previous regulatory period was our provision
of excessive
opex allowances. It considered this was a strong driver of the networks’
inefficient labour practices. It stated
that such factors must not be used to
justify poor productivity outcomes in future years. VECUA, however, provided no
evidence to
support these claims. We note that productivity declines have not
been unique to Australian electricity distribution networks. We
similar declines in productivity in Ontario and New Zealand, which operate under
different regulatory frameworks. Further,
we are unaware of any incentive for
the Victorian DNSPs to increase their actual opex when it is not efficient to do
so. We consider
the drivers of recent productivity declines in our assessment of
Powercor’s base opex in appendix A.
Although it stated that forecast productivity growth should be positive, VECUA
did not suggest a basis on which to forecast positive
productivity growth. VECUA
did state that some of its participants operate in asset intensive industries
that have delivered positive
productivity growth during the 2006–13
period. However it did not identify which industries it was referring to or why
industries would be an appropriate benchmark for electricity distribution.
The [Consumer Challenge Panel] CCP also considered forecast
productivity should
be positive. However, it did suggest we should consider the approach IPART uses
to forecast productivity growth
for the industries it regulates. The approach
the CCP referred to was the approach used by IPART to regulate rural and
regional buses
and local council rates. IPART forecast productivity based on the
15-year average of the ABS market sector value-added multifactor
productivity
(MFP) based on quality adjusted hours worked. It sets forecast productivity
growth to zero when the 15 year average
is negative. The 15 year average
productivity growth for the utilities industry is –3.3 per cent.
Consequently IPART’s
approach to forecasting productivity also results in
forecast productivity growth of zero.
Consistent with previous submissions, the Victorian Department of Economic
Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources (DEDJTR) stated
... with the rollout of smart meters in
Victoria substantially complete, the AER should expect the Victorian DNSPs to
realise efficiency
gains from the rollout. These efficiency gains should be
passed through to customers as the benefits are realised, as it is their
customers, rather than the DNSPs, that have funded the investment in smart
meters through a cost recovery regulatory
We stated in our preliminary decision that DEDJTR had
not identified or quantified the ‘value added benefits’ or the
benefits it expected to be realised over the 2016–20 regulatory
control period. We stated that without this information we
could not incorporate
them into our opex forecast. We also note that DEDJTR had not provided us the
independent assessment of the
benefits of the AMI program that it had referred
DEDJTR stated in its submission on our preliminary decisions that Deloitte
forecast the benefits associated with the rollout of smart
meters in a public
report it prepared in 2011 for the Department of Treasury and Finance. The most
significant benefits identified
in this report relate to capex and metering
expenditure. Deloitte also identified some ‘other smaller benefits’
may be relevant to standard control services opex. Of these smaller
benefits, the most material reductions in standard control services
the avoided cost of investigation of customer complaints
the avoided cost of investigation of customer complaints about loss of supply
which turn out to be not a loss of supply
reduction in calls to faults and emergencies lines
reduced cost of network loading studies for network
DEDJTR stated that a recent review it undertook
indicates that the DNSPs are in the early stages of realising these benefits and
their revealed 2014 operating expenditure would not reflect them.
DEDJTR did not provide this review. It also did not identify how
the savings are
allocated across the DNSPs and the extent to which these savings are reflected
in base opex.
Powercor stated in its revised regulatory proposal that the benefits of the
Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) rollout that it
has realised to date have
largely been realised through savings in alternative control services opex and
are already reflected in
its base metering operating expenditure. It stated the
same was true of standard control services opex and thus its standard control
services opex forecast already reflected the productivity benefits of AMI.
Powercor further stated that it expects the future benefits of the AMI rollout
will relate to capex, rather than opex. It stated
access to AMI data mostly
provides future capital expenditure savings, for example by enabling improved
network and community safety
and improved network investment decisions,
including the potential to defer network augmentation.
In response to DEDJTR's submission, Powercor set out its progress to date on
each of the categories of smart meter benefits identified
and how it is sharing
the benefits with its customers. It noted that it undertook its smart meter
rollout within the timeframes set
out by the Victorian Government. Further, the
rollout was 96 per cent complete by 31 December 2013.
Powercor stated that once it reached a critical mass of smart meter coverage it
commenced implementation of business initiatives
aimed at leveraging smart meter
benefits. These included business initiatives implemented to achieve the smaller
benefits identified
by Deloitte. Powercor described each of these initiatives
and when it implemented the initiatives. In each case Powercor implemented
initiative prior to the commencement of the 2014 base year.

The submissions to the Tribunal
Minister submitted, in summary, that the AER’s decision to adopt zero
percent productivity growth for the Victorian DNSPs
did not take into account
the productivity improvements arising from the AMI rollout (Grounds 1, 2, 3 and
Insights’ advice was that zero should be adopted for NSW/ACT and
Queensland DNSPs: the AER had adopted that advice
to apply it in Victoria. This
was done by the AER despite:
(a) that advice recognising that step
changes could be netted out in Victoria;
(b) there being future productivity benefits arising from the rollout of AMI in
(Grounds 2 and 3 for both).
Economic Insights’ reports were not accepted by the Tribunal in

shift a “like for like” comparison
was required, and that there
should be an adjustment for technical change (which AMI rollout was) (Grounds 1
DNSPs having included AMI productivity benefits in their 2014 base year opex was
not to point. The question was future productivity
benefits. CitiPower/Powercor
in their Reply asserted that they had included the benefits in base year opex.
The benefits they identified
were the avoided costs of no more accumulation
meters, not the future productivity benefits of AMI (Grounds 3 and 4).
AER was advised of the future productivity benefits but took no action to issue
a regulatory information statement (
). Jemena had also told the AER
that it was at the early stages of realising the benefits of AMI. That
reinforced the need for a RIN.
CitiPower/Powercor in their Reply asserted there
was no duty on the AER to inquire, but the authorities they cited were under the
Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977
(Cth). And those
authorities recognised that a decision may miscarry if the decision maker does
not make an obvious inquiry as to
a critical fact. The AER was conferred with an
express power to issue RINs. That sufficed to indicate the legislative intent:
AER must inquire (Ground 2).
identified the reliability benefits.
DNSPs having disputed the Deloitte report as outdated, the AER took no steps to
make its own inquiries and made no adjustment
to the STPIS targets on the basis
that there was insufficient evidence. Again this was a matter that called for a
RIN (Ground 6).
(a) Reliability benefits of AMI only arise
in the last years of the rollout. The AER pointing to the DNSPs as having
completed the
rollout in 2013/14 but there being no reliability improvement
shown was not to point, the time frame to assess this was too short;
(b) The AER did not address the faster restoration times identified by
(Grounds 5 and 7)
CUAC supported the grounds of review raised by the Minister in relation to the
productivity improvements arising from the roll
out of AMI. The CUAC drew to the
Tribunal’s attention the submissions made by VECUA, of which CUAC was a
member, to the effect
that the AER’s decision in its draft determinations
to apply a productivity factor of zero was not supported by the evidence
would result in further declines in the distributors’ productivity levels.
The CUAC supported the Minister’s submission
that the AER erred in
applying a zero per cent productivity growth forecast in its final
determinations for the Victorian DNSPs.
In particular, the CUAC supported the
Minister’s submission that the mandatory rollout of AMI in Victoria had
resulted in significant
productivity improvements and/or efficiencies that will
be realised by the Victorian DNSPs in the 2016-2020 regulatory period. The
noted the evidence of present and future efficiencies in the DNSP regulatory
proposals to the AER. Jemena explicitly forecast
a productivity improvement of
0.89% per year in its opex over the 2016-2020 regulatory period. Although other
Victorian DNSPs did
not forecast productivity improvements, future efficiency
benefits arising from the AMI rollout were nevertheless acknowledged. For
instance, the regulatory proposals of both CitiPower and Powercor stated that
they were already realising network benefits from their
smart meter program and
would continue to do so. CitiPower and Powercor stated that these network
benefits provided long term benefits
to their customers. The CUAC supported the
Minister’s submissions to the effect that whatever option was selected for
the transition
to metering contestability, Victorian DNSPs will still be able to
realise efficiency benefits from the installation of AMI and these
passed on to consumers through the application of a positive productivity
factor. The CUAC submitted the benefits outlined
in the DNSPs’ own
regulatory proposals were broadly indicative of an error in the AER’s
decision not to apply a positive
productivity factor.
affected applicants, the Victorian DNSPs, submitted, in summary, that contrary
to the contention of the Minister, the AER did
not err in determining their
forecast productivity growth on the basis that the rollout of AMI was unlikely
to increase their productivity
over the 2016-2020 period.
principal reason was that, as the AER concluded, these DNSPs had substantially
completed their rollout of AMI prior to the 2014
base-year upon which their opex
forecast was based. Accordingly, the productivity benefits of the AMI rollout
were already incorporated
into their forecasts.
Minister had also misunderstood the way that the AER determined forecast
productivity growth for Victorian DNSPs. This was forecast
on the basis of
change in the efficiency frontier, not on a firm by firm basis. That approach
was open to the AER and no error had
been shown. That, it was submitted,
answered both the Minister’s contention on AMI productivity, and her
contention that the
AER in determining the Victorian DNSPs’ forecast
productivity growth, erred in failing to net out step changes which had affected
their past opex performance. The Minister relied upon a report of Deloitte dated
2 August 2011. However that report was directed
at identifying the overall
societal benefits of AMI over the 2008 to 2028 period, and could not have been
relied upon by the AER
to identify a likely increase in productivity over the
2016-2020 period as a result of the AMI rollout.
Minister also relied on a “Confidential AMI Benefits Report”.
However, she did not supply that report to the AER.
The AER was not obliged to
collect further information on this topic in circumstances where no cogent
submission had been made to
it indicating that further information was
to the Minister’s contention, the AER did not err in deciding not to
adjust STPIS targets for reliability improvements
associated with AMI.
Principally, that was because there was insufficient evidence before the AER to
support the proposition that
AMI would result in reliability improvements over
the 2016-2020 period sufficient to justify an adjustment to the STPIS targets.
In particular, that was because under the STPIS, outage times are measured from
the time a DNSP detects an outage, rather than from
when the outage commences.
While AMI led to faster detection of outages, it did not necessarily improve
outage response time.
AER submitted, in summary, that the “confidential report” was never
provided to it, even though it was requested.
The AER had no record of having
been informed that it was subject to a confidentiality claim. The AER submitted
it did not err by
not using its information-gathering powers. The AER was under
no duty, in the circumstances, to exercise its compulsory information-gathering
powers to obtain the information contained in the “confidential
forecasting productivity growth for the purposes of determining the rate of
change for the calculation of opex, the AER submitted
it used the forecast
“shift in the productivity frontier” across the industry, rather
than on a DNSP-specific or jurisdiction-specific
AER submitted it did not “equate” the Victorian DNSPs with DNSPs in
New South Wales and the ACT; err in relying on
a report by Economic Insights in
respect of the opex of NSW/ACT DNSPs; or “equate” the Victorian
DNSPs with Ergon Energy
(a Queensland DNSP).
AER noted that the Minister asserted that the AER should have netted out step
changes for Victorian DNSPs when determining the
“productive growth rate
for Victoria”. The AER submitted that those submissions on the part of the
Minister did not relate
to any of the Minister’s grounds of review, nor
was this issue raised in her submissions to the AER. Thus this issue could
now be raised before the Tribunal.
any event, the AER submitted, it did not err in the manner that the Minister
the evidence before it, including features of the 2011 Deloitte report, the fact
that the AMI roll-out was largely complete
by 2014, and the DNSPs’
responses to the Minister’s submissions, the AER submitted it was open to
it to estimate the
productivity forecast as it did.
AER submitted it did not equate efficiencies in base-year opex and future
productivity improvements.
AER submitted that its reference to AMI productivity benefits being captured by
the EBSS did not disclose error.
to the STPIS performance targets, the AER submitted that its decisions in
relation to SAIDI targets were made under r 3.2.1(a)
of the STPIS. The
Minister’s submissions were based on figures postulated by Deloitte. Those
figures were intermediate assumptions,
unsupported by evidence or analysis. The
AER was justified in not adjusting the SAIDI targets.
AER submitted that if the Tribunal concluded that the AER committed any of the
reviewable errors alleged by the Minister then
the AER accepted that remitting
the determinations in order to remedy those errors would result in a decision
that was preferable
to the original determinations in making a contribution to
the achievement of the NEO.

the contention that everything in the Economic Insights report was taken up and
adopted by the AER); that

rollout of smart meters in the 2011 Deloitte
report; and the STPIS, particularly
its reliability of supply component.
note the observation made by Senior Counsel for the AER that much of the
Minister’s submissions were irrelevant to the matters
properly before the
Tribunal as they did not relate to her submissions to the AER, raising a s 71O
issue, and did not relate to the
grounds of review set out in the notice of
intervention.
oral submissions, Senior Counsel for CitiPower and Powercor submitted that the
Minister’s grounds of review contained two
discrete topics: the first,
contained in grounds 1 to 4 of the Minister’s notice of intervention,
concerned the subject of
productivity improvements, and that was directed
towards the AER’s productivity growth forecast which was an integer in the
calculation of opex for standard control services. The second topic, contained
in grounds 4 and 5 of the Minister’s notice
of intervention, in many ways
discrete from the first, concerned the reliability benefits, the STPIS grounds.
As to the first topic,
Senior Counsel submitted that the short answer was that
the AER accepted, for good reason, that the rollout of smart meters did not
produce any expected additional opex efficiency gains in the regulatory control
period: the efficiency gains were built into the
base opex for the applicants
and passed through to consumers via that mechanism and future benefits were
anticipated to involve capex
but no addition to opex. As to the second topic,
Senior Counsel submitted the short answer was that there was no evidence before
the AER that the smart meter rollout would be expected to result in a material
improvement in supply reliability in respect of unplanned
Counsel for Jemena adopted those submissions. He submitted that the relevant
meters had been rolled out substantially, almost
entirely, prior to the relevant
base year and, therefore, any efficiency benefits that would be obtained from
the meters had been
picked up by that base year. He further submitted that the
Minister had conflated opex efficiencies that arose from matters as they
at the commencement of the regulatory control period, and any potential further
benefits that could only arise if the business
in question undertook some
additional program, not part of its capex forecast, which the AER had reviewed
and approved. Any opex
benefits associated with that entirely new initiative,
and that resulted from the program, would appropriately be covered by the
for United Energy adopted the preceding submissions.
Counsel for AusNet also adopted those submissions. He added that, with one
exception, the findings of fact complained of in
the Minister’s grounds
were generally methodological choices, value judgements or opinions made or
formed by the AER which
were open to it.
oral submissions, Senior Counsel for the AER submitted there were two key
questions arising in relation to the Minister’s
AMI grounds. The first was
whether there was any or any sufficient evidence before the AER to justify
altering its views on productivity
growth on account of the AMI rollout, both in
relation to productivity relevant to opex and the effect on reliability relevant
the setting of targets under the STPIS. The second, partially related,
question was whether the AER had any duty to inquire or investigate
in response
to the Minister’s submissions which adverted to a recent review that the
Department had undertaken but had not

productivity growth. We find that the
AER did not make the errors for which the Minister contended. In our opinion,
the AER did not
equate the Victorian DNSPs with either the NSW and ACT DNSPs or
with Ergon Energy. The Tribunal finds that what the AER was describing
in its distribution determinations was to set its forecast rate of productivity
growth consistently as a matter of approach,
relevantly by reference to the
recently observed productivity trend of firms at or near the efficient frontier
nationally. As submitted
on behalf of the AER, the “efficient
frontier” referred to the grouping of the most-efficient DNSPs across the
electricity market, against which the AER benchmarked the efficiency of
all DNSPs’ base-year opex. As further submitted, in
turn the “catch
up to the frontier” corresponded to the reduction that the AER made to a
DNSP’s revealed base-year
opex, if it was found to be materially
inefficient: that was the “efficiency adjustment” term of the opex
formula. Fundamentally,
as submitted by the parties opposing the
Minister’s contentions, the AER’s productivity growth forecast used
in determining
the rate of change was directed to the efficient frontier, rather
than to individual DNSPs or jurisdictions. We reject the submission
Minister that the AER should have made a jurisdiction-specific productivity
growth forecast.
the emphasis which Senior Counsel for the Minister placed on the Economic
Insights report, we do not regard the parts of that
report which were concerned
with the adjustments to base year opex of the New South Wales and ACT
distributors as relevant to the
exercise that the AER was undertaking.
in relation to the Economic Insights report, the Tribunal does not accept the
Minister’s submission that the AER adopted
the reasoning in that report so
as to incorporate that reasoning as the AER’s reasoning. Put differently,
in the Tribunal’s
view, the references in the AER’s decisions in
relation to the Victorian DNSPs to the Economic Insights report does not mean
that the AER incorporated the entirety of the reasoning in that report,
especially that part of the report dealing with catch-up
for the NSW and ACT
the Tribunal sees no basis for concluding that the AER’s not exercising
its information gathering powers under the

Decisions to be unreasonable or caused the incorrect

relevant provision is s 28F of the
which provided, relevantly, that
“the AER, if it considers it reasonably necessary for the performance or
exercise of its functions
or powers under this Law or the Rules, may ...”
serve a regulatory information notice. It follows from the terms of the
that there is no duty to exercise the power and the AER has a
discretion whether or not to serve a RIN and to do so where it considers
reasonably necessary to do so for its statutory functions or powers. We refer
also to the terms of s 28J and 28K of the
which impose procedural and
other requirements. The former section requires the AER to give the regulated
network service provider
an opportunity to make written representations as to
whether the AER should serve a RIN on it.
Tribunal finds that it was a case where no version of the Department’s
Review was provided to the AER and that the now asserted
reason for that
non-provision, confidentiality, was not then made out. Indeed it is not now made
out. The Tribunal also finds and
notes that no redacted version of the
Department’s Review was offered or provided to the AER, as one would
expect if a confidentiality
claim were made. The Tribunal finds it was not
suggested to the AER that it might use its powers under the
that Review report.
as the Tribunal finds, the Department’s Review was not provided to the AER
and the AER did not know what the Review contained,
the AER made no error either
in not obtaining it or in not taking it into account. The Tribunal finds that
there was no failure on
the part of the AER to make an obvious enquiry as to a
critical fact: compare the legal regime and the facts considered in
for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI
[2009] HCA 39
259 ALR 429.
that the Minister’s grounds of intervention fail in this respect.
Tribunal sees no error in the way in which the AER treated the 2011 Deloitte
report. How that report might be used is a matter
on which differences of
opinion may reasonably be held. The AER in its final decision gave reasons for
concluding that the information
set out in the 2011 Deloitte report was
inadequate. The AER said as follows:
We have considered the evidence provided to us and are
satisfied that any future benefits arising from the AMI rollout will not
impact standard control services opex. We are satisfied that base
opex sufficiently captures the benefits of the AMI rollout, as
they relate to
standard control services opex, because the AMI meters were largely rolled out
by the start of the base year.
We are satisfied that the majority of the benefits of
the AMI rollout that relate to AusNet Services’ standard control services
opex are already reflected in its base opex. We are satisfied that the future
benefits of the AMI rollout will primarily relate to
capex, rather than opex.
While there could be some minor opex benefits, based on the available
information, it is unclear whether base opex already reflects
these minor
benefits. We do not think the available information provides a basis to make any
adjustment for these minor benefits.
is also to be noted that the Deloitte report was made in 2011 and dealt with the
period from 2008 to 2028. The Tribunal does not
regard it as a solid basis on
which to forecast productivity growth for the period 2016 to 2020. We also note
the cogent submissions
made by the DNSPs as to why the Deloitte report should
not be relied on by the AER to adjust its productivity forecast.
Tribunal sees no error in the conclusion of the AER that the Deloitte report
constituted insufficient material for the AER to
adjust its productivity
forecast for the Victorian DNSPs.
have considered the 2011 Deloitte report, especially figure 4.10 on page 83. We
accept the AER’s submission that by 2014,
the yellow band, relating to the
“other smaller benefits” had expanded to substantially its full
height and, therefore,
that Deloitte’s modelling in its report appeared to
indicate that the “other smaller benefits” from the AMI rollout
expected to have been realised by 2014, the base year. We note that the Minister
relied on part only of the “other smaller
Tribunal does not accept the Minister’s submission that the AER erred in
conflating accrued productivity benefits with future
productivity benefits or
that this reflected a “conceptual confusion” fundamental to the
AER’s decision, as the
Minister contended.
do not accept the Minister’s submission that the AER erroneously decided
that the DNSPs should not be rewarded through the
EBSS for productivity
improvements arising from the rollout of AMI, but that AMI efficiencies should
be passed on to customers by
adjusting the productivity growth forecast. In our
opinion the statement by the AER that “any benefits that have not yet been
realised will be shared with consumers through our revealed cost forecasting
framework and the EBSS” was an immaterial observation,
the AER having
already concluded that it was not satisfied that there were any future
productivity benefits that were not already
reflected in the 2014 base year
as the Minister’s criticised the AER for not having regard to step
changes, in our opinion it is clear that the Minister
did not make any
submissions to the AER about this and neither did the Minister include that
matter in the notice of intervention.
Section 71O(2)(c) of the
the effect that the Minister “may not raise in relation to the issue of
whether a ground for review exists or has been
made out” that matter as it
was not raised by the Minister in a submission to the AER before the reviewable
regulatory decision
was made. In our view although it may be a matter of
judgement in some cases as to the specificity with which a matter is required
be raised, in the present case raising productivity as a general topic does not
have the effect that netting out step changes
may now be raised. Section
71P(2b)(a) is not relevant because that provision deals with the consequences of
error rather than the
identification of error.
any event, we do not find that the AER made such an error. The Tribunal finds
that the AER addressed the effects of and did have
regard to past step changes,
for example at pages 7-70 of each of the CitiPower/Powercor Preliminary
Minister’s grounds of review, grounds 5 and 6, then turned to the issue of
reliability.
Minister submitted that the AER decision not to adjust the SAIDI target in light
of asserted AMI benefits was not justified. In
our opinion, this ground turns on
competing understandings of the 2011 Deloitte report. We conclude that the
AER’s understanding
of that report did not involve any relevant error. We
see no error in the AER’s understanding that the Deloitte report had
limited purpose, being to compare the relative cost-benefit analysis of removing
the government mandate for the AMI rollout from
31 December 2011, as opposed to
continuing the AMI program beyond 1 January 2012. That cost-benefit comparison
was performed by reference
to the forecast costs and benefits of the program
across the 20 year period from 2008-2028. The assessments made as to percentage
SAIDI improvement rates were merely intermediate assumptions that Deloitte
applied, to provide a monetary quantification of the value
of faster outage
detection and restoration times on the DNSPs’ low voltage systems. We find
no error in the AER’s conclusion
that the empirical evidence before it did
not accord with the assumptions in the 2011 Deloitte report. Whether the
reliability benefits
were “expected to result in a material improvement in
supply reliability” as reported by Deloitte was otherwise a matter
AER’s judgement.
Minister also submitted, with reference to the 2011 Deloitte report, that the
AER erred by failing to refer to the benefits associated
with faster response
times, rather than faster detection times. We can discern no reviewable error in
this respect. There is no separate
quantification in the Deloitte report of the
claimed faster response times benefits. That report itself said that the
anticipated
benefits in relation to faster restoration of supply were
“unlikely to significantly reduce SAIDI results” and were
to quantify”. The response-time component of the
reliability improvements were assumed by Deloitte.
Minister contended that the AER, when making the distribution determinations,
failed to discharge its obligation under r 6.6.2(a)
incentives to maintain and improve reliability performance. However r 6.6.2(a)
relates to the AER making the STPIS, not
to the making of a distribution
determination. The Tribunal sees no basis for the Minister’s contention.
