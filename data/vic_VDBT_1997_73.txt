DR DAMIEN CREMEAN
DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON
DOMESTIC BUILDING TRIBUNAL
REASONS FOR DETERMINATION
1. On 3 July 1997 I adjourned the Case Management Conference in this matter
to 4 August 1997.
2. There is a preliminary issue concerning the authority of the Tribunal to
proceed in the matter. The Application is dated 18 March
1997 but was filed on
19 March 1997. By such Application it is sought to appeal the decision of the
First Respondent ("the Fund")
notice of which is stated to have been given on 28
February 1997. One issue is the exact nature of that decision. For the purpose
of the proceeding on 4 August Affidavits in support of the Applicant were sworn
by Salko Custovic and Vlado Mega both on 31 July
1997. There is an earlier
Affidavit in support of the Fund sworn by Suzanne Kirton on 11 June 1997. The
Applicant provided the
Tribunal also with a helpful Chronology of Events.
3. Based on the Affidavit of Vlada Mega, and on what was put to the Tribunal
at the proceeding, there is an issue about whether an
extension of time should
be granted under s99 of the 1995 Act. That section reads as follows:
(1) "The Tribunal may, on the application of the party, the Commission, the
Director or on its own motion, extend any time limit fixed
by this Act for the
doing of any act or the taking of any proceeding or waive compliance with any
procedural requirement.
(2) The Tribunal may make an order under this section even though the
application for the making of the order was not made until after
the expiration
of the time appointed or fixed for the doing of the act or the taking of the
proceeding.
(3) The Tribunal make not exercise a power given to it under this section if
to do so would cause any prejudice or detriment to a
party (or potential party)
to a proceeding that cannot be remedied by an appropriate order for costs or
4. The guiding principles to the exercise of discretion under s99(1) are to
be found in the judgement of Wilcox J
Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd
& Ors v. Minister for Home Affairs and Environment
(1984) 58 ALR 305 at
310-11. Those principles were summarised by His Honour Judge Davey
Gaywood Constructions Pty Ltd v HGFL and Ganly
(DBT, 13 September 1996) as
1. Although special circumstances need not be shown a court will not grant
the application unless positively satisfied that it is
proper to do so. It is a
pre-condition to the exercise of discretion that the applicant for extension of
time show an "acceptable
explanation of the delay" and that it is "fair and
equitable in the circumstances" to extend time.
2. The action taken by the Applicant other than by making an application for
a review is relevant to the consideration of whether
there is an acceptable
explanation for the delay. It is relevant to consider whether or not the
Applicant has continued to make
the decision maker aware that he contests the
decision and has not rested on his rights.
3. Any prejudice to the respondent, including any prejudice in defending the
proceedings occasioned by delays is a material factor
militating against the
exercise of an extension.
4. The mere absence of prejudice is not enough to grant an extension.
5. The merits of the substantial claims are properly to be taken into account
in considering whether an extension of time should be
6. Consideration of fairness as between the Applicants and other persons
otherwise in a like position are relevant to manner of the
exercise of the
discretion.
5. The Fund’s position in this matter is that the relevant decision on
liability was made on 25 September 1995. If that is
so, it would seem clear
that no question of an extension of time could now arise. The
Contracts Guarantee Act
, at the time, imposed a 60 day time limit
within which to appeal. No appeal was undertaken within 60 days and that period
days is unable now to be extended under s99(1) of the Act. It is not a
period "fixed by" the 199- Act. See generally
Gionaka v HGFL
6. It was submitted, however, on behalf of the Applicant that I should find
that the relevant decision was made on 29 November 1996
(or on 3 December 1996 -
the date of receipt). In a letter of 29 November 1996 the Fund states: "we
affirm our previous decision
in regards to the claim." It was put to me that
this was a separate decision (sufficient under
House Contracts
Guarantee Act
) in the sense that it was a decision not to alter a
decision. I would agree, in a sense, that this was so. The previous decision
is affirmed and not altered. But that does not in my view mean that a separate
decision was taken. The real decision, or the operative
decision, was the
previous decision. Affirmation of that decision merely continued the position
adopted by or in that decision and
did nothing else. A fresh decision was not
7. However, even if this was not so, and if, therefore, the decision taken on
29 November 1997 was a separate or fresh decision, there
would still be the
question whether a discretion under s99(1) ought to be exercised in favour of
the Applicant. Within the meaning
of the authorities, I can find no excuse in
any of the materials which justified delaying until 19 March 1997 to commence
proceedings.
It is not in my view a sufficient explanation of the delay to say
(as does Mr Mega) that he was at "all material times, .........
lead to believe
that [others, on behalf of the Applicant] were in communication [with the Fund]
with respect to the issue of liability
for the defects." That, to my mind,
provides no basis for any "acceptable" explanation of the delay such as to
warrant a favourable
exercise of discretion. In any event, it would seem, there
could be no exercise of discretion open under s99(1) by reason of s99(3)
because, it seems, that the Fund paid out in this matter as long ago as 11
December 1995.
8. In all the circumstances, for the reasons I have given, I am plainly of
the view that no occasion for an exercise of discretion
under s99(1) of the Act
either can arise or has arisen. However that still leaves open the true
character of the decision of the
Fund referred to in the Application notice of
which is stated to have been given on 28 February 1997. This letter, a copy of
I think is on file, appears to be a demand by the Fund for payment of
$11,660.00 said to be "overdue". The letter, however, is addressed
different person from the present Applicant. If it was a decision relating to
quantum concerning the present Applicant the
Application would be within time by
principles laid down by
the Tribunal in
HGF v Seymour
(DBT, 21 May
9. I am of the view, therefore, that, at this stage, this matter should not
be struck out or dismissed. Clearly, in my view, it cannot
proceed as a review
of a decision relating to liability. But, as it specifies, it may be able to
proceed as a review of a decision
against quantum. If the matter as a whole is
to be withdrawn I would intend that the Fund should have all its reasonable
costs based
on the appropriate Magistrates’ Court Scale. If the matter is
to proceed now in relation to quantum only, I would intend that
the Fund should
be paid its costs for the proceeding on 4 August 1997 again based on that scale
(with due allowance being made for
the Fund’s Affidavit).
10. I shall direct that this matter be returned to Case Management Conference
on a convenient date after 29 August 1997 if not withdrawn
sooner. The parties
are each at liberty to until that date (upon notice to the other) to apply to
have this matter re-listed for
hearing before me on the question of costs should
they be unable to
agree upon the same. The liberty extends also to any other question on which
further directions may be sought until that date.
