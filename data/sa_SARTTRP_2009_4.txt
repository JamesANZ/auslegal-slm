R & R Parks Pty Ltd (trading as Dalkeith Caravan Park) v Edwards [2009] SARTTRP 4 (5 March 2009)
Section 97 - Order for possession
R & R Parks Pty Ltd (trading as Dalkeith Caravan Park) v Edwards
(RP09/0003)
REASONS FOR ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL MADE ON
Hearing 5 March 2009 at Adelaide
R & R PARKS PTY LTD (Trading as Dalkeith Caravan
Park) v EDWARDS (RP09/0003)
This is the determination of an application lodged on 2 March 2009 by
Dalkeith Caravan Park, a residential park, against a resident,
Bryan Edwards
asking the Tribunal to make an urgent order that the resident’s agreement
be terminated.
The Tribunal heard sworn evidence from Mr Robert Flett, the manager of
Dalkeith Caravan Park and the resident, Mr Bryan Edwards.
Witnesses, Darren
Ryder and Mark King attended the hearing for Mr Flett but were not required to
give evidence.
I find there is a Residential Park Site Agreement which is subject to the
Residential Parks Act, 2007
(“the Act”) in the following terms:-
Rented property: Site
, Dalkeith Caravan Park, Lot 82 Main North Road,
Evanston South.
Park owner: R and R Parks Pty Ltd.
Resident: Bryan Edwards.
Agreement commenced: 5 October 2008.
Period of the agreement: Periodic.
Rent: $91.30 per week, payable
Security Bond: $220.00 was paid by the resident and is lodged
Commissioner for Consumer Affairs (Bond No 7000319-7).
On 1 March 2009 Mr Flett personally served Mr Edwards with a notice in the
prescribed form (form E) giving notice to Mr Edwards that
he was excluded from
the park for having committed a serious act of violence in the park and having
put the safety of another or
other persons in the park in danger.
The notice was served pursuant to
of the Act.
It was not necessary for me to hear evidence from the witnesses who attended
the hearing for the residential park. Mr Edwards agreed
that he would no longer
remain in the park and he and Mr Flett negotiated arrangements which will enable
Mr Edwards to come to the
park in the short term to remove his personal effects
from the van and eventually to either sell or dispose of the van.
Mr Edwards agreed that the security bond of $220.00 should be paid to the
park in satisfaction of any outstanding or future rent debt
and Mr Flett agreed
to accept such an arrangement.
Mr Edwards is to come to the park to collect his goods but it was not
possible to nominate the precise time that he will do this.
Mr Edwards is
relying on friends to provide him with a ute. Mr Edwards agreed that he will
give Mr Flett notice as soon as he has
arranged a time to come to the park. Mr
Flett will then be able to notify Mr Ryder and Mr King and they may choose to be
the park when Mr Edwards is present.
The order appearing below reflects the intention of the parties. The
resident will have right to dispose of the van by either sale
or destruction but
will only have permission to come to the park for that purpose with the
owner’s consent.
of the Act I order that the Residential Park Agreement terminate and,
subject to the orders appearing below, I make an order for
possession of the
rented property at Site
, Dalkeith Caravan Park, Lot 82 Main North Road,
Evanston South at 1.00pm on Friday 3 April 2009, on condition that if the
fails to give up possession then this order may only be enforced by the
Tribunal bailiff.
Further, under
of the Act I make the following
ancillary order: The resident is hereby excluded from the park and must not
enter or remain in the
park except in the following circumstances:
(a) the resident may enter the park with the owner/manager’s
approval for the purpose of removing his personal effects from
property. The resident must give reasonable notice to the owner/manager who
must then allow a reasonable time on Friday
6 March, Saturday 7 March or Monday
9 March 2009 and the resident must remove any personal effects no later than
5.00pm on Monday
9 March 2009.
(b) The resident may enter the park with the owner/manager’s prior
consent on a reasonable number of occasions after giving
reasonable notice to
the owner/manager for the purpose of selling or removing the dwelling on the
rented property. If the dwelling
has not been removed by 1.00pm on Friday 3
April 2009 the resident will be taken to have relinquished any claim to the
dwelling and
the park owner may deal with the dwelling as abandoned property
of the Act.
Section 116(1)(j)
of the Act, I order that the security bond of $220.00 held by
the Commissioner (Bond No. 7000319-7) be paid to the Park Owner.
