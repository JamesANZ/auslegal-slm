INTRODUCTION
1. On 24 April 2017 the applicant, Elaine Bennett, filed a
referral in the Motor Accidents Compensation Tribunal (“the
in which she says she is aggrieved by the refusal or failure of
the respondent to make payment by way of scheduled benefits in relation
injury she sustained in a motor vehicle accident that occurred on 15 October
2016. Attached to that referral was a letter
from the respondent to the
applicant dated 10 April 2017 in which the respondent indicated that medical
evidence it had obtained
did not support the applicant’s spinal complaints
as having arisen directly as a result of the motor vehicle accident that
occurred on 29 October 2016 and as a result liability for those expenses was
denied. All outstanding accounts held on file were
returned to the applicant
with that letter. Also attached to the referral were copies of seven accounts
from five different medical
providers although there were two copies of one of
the seven accounts. The total cost of the treatment comprised in the six
was $8,717.00.
2. On 17 May 2017 the applicant filed a second
in which she says she is aggrieved by a determination of the respondent on 10
April 2017 that any spinal complaints have not arisen
as a direct result of a
motor vehicle accident that occurred on 15 or 29 October 2016 and/or the refusal
or failure of the respondent
to make payments by way of scheduled benefits in
relation to the injuries she sustained in that motor vehicle accident. Again
applicant attached the respondent’s letter to her of 10 April 2017 and
the same seven accounts that had previously been lodged
with the first
3. Thereafter the referrals were set down for a further
teleconference on 20 June 2017 although that teleconference did not proceed
because the applicant was waiting upon a report from the neurosurgeon, Mr
Erasmus, to support her referral. That report was delivered
to the Tribunal on
2 October 2017. The matter was listed for a further teleconference on 10
November 2017; however that teleconference
did not proceed because the
respondent had arranged for the applicant to be medically assessed on 5 January
4. The notes of the Deputy Registrar at a further teleconference on 14
February 2018 suggest the referrals were likely to resolve.
5. On 26 March
2018 the Tribunal received a consent memorandum in the following terms:
consent the parties seek the following Orders:
the Respondent pay to the Applicant $1,358.90 being schedule benefits payable in
accordance with the Motor Accidents (Liabilities
& Compensation) Act 1973 in
relation to the injuries she sustained in the motor vehicle accident that
occurred on 15 October
2016 being:
Mr Erasmus (18 December 2016) $800.00
Calvary Health Care (16 December 2016) $100.00
Dr McCarthy (16 August 2017)
the Respondent pay the Applicant’s cost of the Referral to be taxed in
accordance with Schedule 1 of the
Supreme Court Rules 2000
6. On 28 March 2018 I made an order in terms of paragraph 1 of
the consent memorandum, however in respect of the application for costs
paragraph 2 I made the following order:
“2. That the respondent
pay the applicant’s costs of the referral to be taxed at the rate of 85%
of the fees set out in
of Schedule 1 of the
Supreme Court Rules
7. On 13 April 2018 the Tribunal received a letter from Murdoch
Clarke which noted that an order had not been made with respect to
accordance with the consent memorandum. The author of that letter, Mr Gaggin,
asked why that was so and the basis upon
which the Tribunal “has
unilaterally determined that a different costs order should be made to that
which was agreed by the
parties.” He also asked the Tribunal to provide
reasons for that determination.
8. My clerk advised Mr Gaggin by email of 13
April 2018 that the order with respect to costs was made in line with my
decision in
Brook v Motor Accidents Insurance Board [2017] TASMACT 3.
17 April 2018 the Tribunal received a further letter from Murdoch Clarke in
which Mr Gaggin noted the Brook decision was of
little assistance because in
that case the parties were not agreed as to the form of the costs order whereas
in this case they were.
He went on to say “The parties could just as
easily have settled the matter by Deed and had the Referral dismissed.”
He therefore sought written reasons for my order with respect to costs. What
follows are those reasons.
DETERMINATION
Regulation 14(1)
Motor Accidents Compensation
Tribunal Regulations 2009
deals with the question of costs. That regulation
determining a reference, the Tribunal may order a party to the reference to pay
costs to another party to the reference
and may fix the reasonable amount of
those costs.”
11. That regulation vests in the Tribunal an unfettered
discretion which must be exercised judicially. Ordinarily the proper exercise
of that discretion dictates that costs follow the event and are therefore
awarded to the successful party. The rationale for such
an order was explained
by McHugh J in Latoudis v Casey
[1990] HCA 59
(1990) 170 CLR 534
at 567 in the
following terms:
“The rationale of the
order is that it is just and reasonable that the party who has caused the other
party to incur the costs
of litigation should reimburse that party for the
liability incurred. The order is not made to punish the unsuccessful party.
function is compensatory. Thus, in civil proceedings an order may, and
usually will, be made even though the unsuccessful party
has nearly succeeded or
has acted reasonably in commencing the
proceedings.”
12. The ordinary rule that costs follow the event may be
departed from where the conduct of the successful party, other than that
gave rise to the claim, was unreasonable or improper or where that party did
something connected with the proceedings which
was calculated to occasion
unnecessary litigation or expense: Unilever Australia Limited v Gunn, Rose Jane
& PD Wholesalers
[1998] TASSC 143.
It is clear from the material on file
and the consent memorandum that the ordinary rule is not to be departed
13. The usual practice in this Tribunal in making an order for costs
under r14 is for the Tribunal to order that the unsuccessful
party pay the
successful party’s costs of the referral at the rate of 85% of the fees
of Schedule 1 of the
Supreme Court Rules 2000
practice). That practice has recently been followed in Bugg v Motor Accidents
Insurance Board [2016] TASMACT 3, a decision
of former Chairperson Carey,
Simmons v Motor Accidents Insurance Board [2016] TASMACT 1, a decision of former
Tribunal Member Chandler,
and by me in Brook v Motor Accidents Insurance Board
[2017] TASMACT 3. In this case the inference from Mr Gaggin’s letters
because the parties are agreed at the level of costs then the Tribunal is bound
to give effect to that agreement; i.e. the power
in r14 is somehow fettered by
that agreement. I do not accept that argument.
Regulation 14
contains no such
fetter. It is
that the consent of the parties does not clothe a court or tribunal with
the fact that the
parties to this referral have agreed to the form of the order for costs or their
quantum does not of itself oust
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to make an
order on a different basis or quantum: Yunupingu v Goodsell (Unreported decision
the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory dated 24 December 1998) at
paragraphs 6-8 and Blackley v Rigby
[2013] NTSC 12
at 26. In Yunupingu v
Goodsell (supra) Martin J. ruled that an agreement that neither party in
criminal proceedings would seek an
order for costs did not divest the Court of
its jurisdiction to order costs according to the justice of the case. In
particular,
at [6] his Honour said the discretion to award cost “is vested
in the Court by the Parliament. It has prescribed the fetters
on its exercise
and they do not include reference to any such agreement. The jurisdiction of
the Court cannot be ousted by any such
agreement...”
14. It is clear,
however, that an agreement between the parties as to costs is relevant to the
exercise of a court or tribunal’s
discretion: see Geoform Design Pty Ltd
Architects v Randwick City Council
[1995] NSWLEC 80
(1995) 87 LGERA 140
at 147, 152.
addition to the agreement between the parties as to costs in this matter I note
that although the sum which the applicant recovered
may have been significant to
her, her claim was not a large one when compared to other referrals lodged in
this Tribunal. Neither
was her claim a complex one. I also take into account
the usual practice with respect to orders for costs in this jurisdiction and
fact that the claim was brought in an inferior jurisdiction to that of the
Supreme Court. Despite the agreement then, and for
reasons of consistency, I am
not persuaded that the usual practice should not be followed in this
16. I repeat what I said in Brook v Motor Accidents Insurance Board
(supra) at [10]:
the usual practice is not followed, then not only will there be inconsistency
between the level of costs which can be recovered
in the Workers Rehabilitation
& Compensation Tribunal and this Tribunal, there will also be inconsistency
with decisions in this
Tribunal. It seems to me the usual practice has been
influenced not only by r15(2) of the Workers Rehabilitation & Compensation
Regulations 2011 but also by a decision of Zeeman J. in Trident Seafoods Pty Ltd
v Dransfield
[1993] TASSC 87.
That case was an appeal from the Workers
Compensation Commissioner who dismissed an application made by the appellant for
that the respondent pay the appellant’s costs of an unsuccessful
application made by the respondent. In those days s59 of
the Workers
Rehabilitation & Compensation Act 1988 prohibited the granting of costs to
or against any party unless there were
some special features arising from the
circumstances of the case before the Commissioner that warranted the making of
the order for
costs in favour of one of the parties. After reviewing the
matter, Zeeman J. concluded the Commissioner could have reached the position
that an order for costs should have been made. As to the level of costs,
counsel for the appellant submitted that costs should be
ordered on Table A
which was the highest award of costs available in the Supreme Court at that
time. Zeeman J. said, with respect
to that submission at [14]:
‘I am not persuaded that that is appropriate. The proceedings were
proceedings in an inferior court. Table A is the highest
scale of costs
applying to this Court.’”
17. Accordingly the order with respect to costs is the
respondent pay the applicant’s costs of the referral to be taxed at
rate of 85% of the fees set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the
Supreme Court
