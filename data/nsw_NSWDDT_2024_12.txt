these proceedings I delivered judgment in favour of the plaintiff against the
defendants on 25 July 2024 (the primary judgment):
Keogh v CPB Contractors
Pty Ltd & Ors (No 2)
[2024] NSWDDT 9.
further judgment concerns whether the costs ordered in favour of the plaintiff
against the fifth defendant should be apportioned
pursuant to
Workers Compensation Act 1987
(the WC Act).
9 in the primary judgment was the costs order in favour of the plaintiff. Order
“Order the first, second, third and fifth defendants to pay the costs of
the plaintiff.”
10 and 11 in the primary judgment dealt with the cross claim for contribution
brought by the fifth defendant against the third
defendant. Those orders were as
“10 Judgment for the fifth defendant against the third
defendant on the Amended Fifth Cross Claim in relation to mine dust
exposure at
the Boggabri Mine for $548,774.42.
11 Order the third defendant to pay the costs of the fifth
defendant of and incidental to the Amended Fifth Cross Claim.”
30 September 2024 the parties returned to court to deal with a number of
post-judgment issues. Mr Rowles, on behalf of the fifth
defendant, sought a
variation of Order 11. Mr Sheller SC, who then appeared for the third defendant
in relation to the Boggabri Mine,
did not oppose the variation sought by Mr
Rowles. Order 1 made on 30 September 2024 was as follows:
“Order that Order 11 made on 25 July 2024 be varied to add the words
‘including 70% of the costs payable by the Fifth
Defendant to the
Plaintiff under Order 9 made on 24 July 2024.”
the costs order made on the Amended Fifth Cross Claim now reads:
“Order the third defendant to pay the costs of the fifth defendant of and
incidental to the Amended Fifth Cross Claim including
70% of the costs payable
by the Fifth Defendant to the Plaintiff under Order 9 made on 24 July
30 September 2024 Mr Rowles also indicated that the fifth defendant wished to
seek an order under s 151S(2) of the WC Act. Directions
were made for the fifth
defendant to file and serve a written submission on this issue by 8 October
2024. That submission was received
and has been marked as “MFI 36”.
A direction was also made for the plaintiff and the third defendant (re the
Mine) to file and serve written submissions in reply by 15 October
2024. Both parties indicated to the court, on 9 October 2024,
that they opposed
the order sought by the fifth defendant, but they did not wish to file any
written submission. In those circumstances
judgment was reserved on the
application in relation to s 151S(2) of the WC Act.
Legislation
151S of the WC Act is contained in the modified common law damages provisions of
the WC Act. Section 151S is as follows:
“(1) If a judgment is obtained for payment of damages to which this
Division applies as well as for other damages, the court
is required, as part of
the judgment, to declare what portion of the sum awarded by the judgment is
damages to which this Division
(2) In any such case the court is required to apportion any costs
the trial Mr Rowles sought an order under s 151S(1) of the WC Act for the
apportionment of damages. The primary judgment at [598]-[602]
dealt with that
application as follows:
Apportionment of Damages and Costs
598 Section 151S of the WCA provides as follows:
‘151S Court to apportion damages etc
(1) If a judgment is obtained for payment of damages to which this Division
applies as well as for other damages, the court is required,
as part of the
judgment, to declare what portion of the sum awarded by the judgment is damages
to which this Division applies.
(2) In any such case the court is required to apportion any costs
599 Mr Rowles submitted (MFI 24, par 4.4) that ‘time on
risk is the only way to determine each defendant’s responsibility’
and that this ‘must be done to undertake the assessment of damages to be
awarded under Div 3 Pt 5 of the WCA (as against the
fifth defendant)’.
600 Mr Tzouganatos submitted (MFI 8, par 243) that there is
nothing in s 151S that prevents the Tribunal from entering judgment
for the full
amount of damages against each defendant, including the fifth defendant. All
that is required is that the Tribunal declare
what portion of the sum awarded
was damages as against the fifth defendant.
601 I accept the submission of Mr Tzouganatos. It is supported
by the decisions of the Court of Appeal in
Oxley County Council v
[1999] NSWCA 126
Timberland Property Holdings Pty
Ltd v Bundy
[2005] NSWCA 419
. In accordance with those
decisions, I will find a judgment against Downer Regional for the full amount of
damages as calculated
below. Those decisions suggest that s 151S is relevant
where there are two joint tortfeasors, one of which is an employer, and s
of the WCA comes into play. Section 151S really has no work to do where (as
here) there are separate assessments against successive
tortfeasors.
602 For more abundant caution, I will declare that the full
amount of the judgment against Downer Regional is for damages to which
modified common law damages provisions of the WCA apply.”
written submission of Mr Rowles (MFI 36) acknowledged that there was no decided
case upon the meaning of s 151S(2). The section
was introduced into the WC Act
Workers Compensation (Benefits) Amendment Act 1989
Explanatory Note to that Act simply says:
“Section 151S requires a court to apportion damages in certain
was said in the Second Reading Speeches (Legislative Assembly, 1 August 1989, pp
8820-8823 and 2 August 1989 (pp 9185-9257)
concerning the meaning or effect of
any part of s 151S.
Consideration
repeat what I said at par 601 of the primary judgment. In my view s 151S of the
WC Act is only relevant where there are two joint
tortfeasors, one of which is
an employer, and s 151Z of the WC Act comes into play. Section 151S has no work
to do where, as in this
case, there are separate assessments against successive
tortfeasors.
order sought by Mr Rowles was as follows (MFI 36, par 1.9):
“The Fifth Defendant submits that the Court should assign costs to be
awarded as against the Fifth Defendant to the Plaintiff
based on the costs that
the Plaintiff has incurred in prosecuting his case against the Fifth Defendant
and then apportion 70% of
those costs to the Third Defendant and 30% to the
Fifth Defendant (in accordance with the Court’s judgment in the claim for
contribution of the Fifth Defendant against the Third Defendant).”
Rowles has already achieved that aim by the variation of the costs order made on
30 September 2024 which is referred to above.
That variation was not based upon
s 151S(2), but upon the conventional approach to contribution between
tortfeasors, to the effect
that both damages and costs should be apportioned
between those parties – see
James Hardie & Coy Pty Ltd v Wyong
Shire Council
[2000] NSWCA 107
(2000) 48 NSWLR 679.
In that case the Court
of Appeal held that the right of a defendant tortfeasor to recover contribution
from a concurrent tortfeasor
extends to and includes any costs recoverable by
the plaintiff.
the primary judgment I found that it was not necessary to apply s 151S(1) of the
WC Act, because I found that the diseases suffered
by Mr Keogh were divisible,
and thus a discrete and separate amount was awarded against the fifth defendant.
In those circumstances
I see no reason to apportion costs under s 151S(2) of the
s 151S(2) commences with the words “[i]n any such case”, which must
be a reference back to subs (1) which gives
the court a power to declare what
portion of the sum awarded by the judgment is damages to which the WC Act
applies. For the reasons
set out at [598]-[602] of the primary judgment, no such
apportionment was made as to damages, and thus there is no “such
requiring the court to apportion any costs awarded.
view of the variation of the costs order against the fifth defendant referred to
above, and because in my view s 151S has no application
to the present case, I
decline to make an order under s 151S(2) of the WC Act. Thus, the further
application by the fifth defendant
fails. I will order the fifth defendant to
pay the costs of the plaintiff and the third defendant of that
application.
orders of the Tribunal are:
(1) Dismiss the application based upon
Workers Compensation Act
(NSW), made by the fifth defendant, for a variation of the existing
costs orders.
(2) Order the fifth defendant to pay the costs of the plaintiff and the third
defendant (re the Boggabri Mine) of and incidental
to the application.
