MEDICAL SCIENCE AND THE LAW
BELINDA BENNETT
Advances in medical science have presented both law and bioethics with some
of the most fascinating questions of our time. As science
continues to forge
ahead into new frontiers, in fields such as reproductive technology, human
genetics, cloning technologies, and
stem cell research, questions have arisen
over the role for law in regulating this new terrain. The speed with which
medical science
has advanced, and continues to advance, can make it difficult to
formulate appropriate regulatory responses. The rapid pace of scientific
and the increasing complexity of the science can present hurdles and barriers to
the engagement of the public with science
and the legal and ethical issues
raised by it. As Michael Kirby has pointed out:
In a sense, many of the problems presented by science and technology have
gone beyond the understanding even of the intelligent lay
person. How many
citizens really understand what the atom is? What the relativity theory of
Einstein means? How a computer really
works? What a gene truly is and how it
operates? How the brain functions? And how it gives rise to that greatest
mystery of all,
intelligent consciousness?
It is against this backdrop that George Smith develops his analysis of the
relationship between law, religion and medical science.
By seeking to articulate
a renewed role for religion in contemporary society, Smith engages with the key
question of ethical certainty
in the face of constant change. Smith argues that
‘far from being antagonistic to law and medicine, religion and religious
principles stabilize the field of biomedicine and serve, additionally, as
vectors of force shaping both ethical and moral constructs
for decision
Although he acknowledges the
decision making role often given to the law,
Smith is cautious about ascribing law, rather than religion, a determining role
for morality:
When a distinctly religious voice in, for example, medical ethics becomes
passive or is lost, this in turn encourages a form a moral
philosophy for the
market place and thus places law as the dominant source of
It may be, as Smith argues, that religion could provide a framework for
ethical decision-making in the face of new challenges. Yet
this framework
remains elusive precisely because the shared nature of ethical viewpoints is
increasingly contested territory. In
part these difficulties arise because the
ethical and regulatory issues presented by medical science highlight many of the
that already exist in contemporary society. Traditional social
institutions such as the Church and the nuclear family are being reshaped
broader social changes of our times that include an increasing secularism in
society, greater gender equality, greater participation
by women in the paid
workforce, the trend towards smaller families and a growing focus on consumerism
and individualism.
In the face of these developments, and given the difficulties associated with
finding common ground in ethical debates, the law is,
as Smith points
often given the role of mediator, with
the courts crafting solutions for individual cases and law reform bodies and
legislatures
formulating broader solutions at the macro level. Even here the
solutions are not straightforward. The fact that the assumed ethical
certainties of the past no longer seem as self-evident or as straightforward
adds new complexities to the task of devising
regulatory frameworks in the face
of the ethical dilemmas presented by new science.
Smith sees religion as providing the foundations for contemporary morality,
with these religious foundations providing a solid base
for the ethical
decisions necessary for both law and science. In this context, he argues that
‘there can be no disputation
of the first order significance of the moral
and ethical theories and principles derived from
and the law, informed by
ethical principles then plays ‘the primary role of directing and
stabilizing all courses of human
It is this relationship
between religion, law and science that Smith sees as ‘a creative
partnership’.
Smith acknowledges that the relationship between religion, science and the
law has often been a rocky one. As he points out in his
article, science and
religion have clashed on many occasions, leading to hotly contested public
debates around issues such as evolutionary
theory. Despite these differences,
Smith argues that science and religion can find common ground in their shared
concern for the
human condition:
Perhaps the noblest and most practical point of balance between religion and
science should be love, justice or humaneness –
for its achievement by man
promotes the essence of faith by instilling meaning and value to the
life-experience and also enhances
one’s overall physical well being.
Stated otherwise, the fulcrum of this balancing test between religion and
science is the
achievement of a point of equilibrium that promotes policies and
shapes direct actions that minimize suffering and improve the social
of all men.
It is this appeal to common humanity and respect for human rights that
perhaps holds the most promise for finding that common ground
that seems so
elusive. In a postmodern world, where diversity and pluralism are part of
contemporary life, it is important to continue
to remind ourselves to look
beyond differences. This does not entail a rejection of diversity and pluralism.
On the contrary, we
should be seeking those points of commonality and agreement
that co-exist with, and are respectful of, diversity. Our commitment
universal human rights is built on precisely this approach. The
Declaration of Human Rights
states in Article 1 that ‘All human beings
are born free and equal in dignity and
The influence of human
rights discourse is increasingly evident within bioethics and medical

dialogue continues, new points of connection may emerge.
Medical science will undoubtedly continue to present us with both fascinating
possibilities and perplexing dilemmas. The task of finding
a path through these
tangled debates seems likely to be a long-term one. George Smith’s article
argues for a role for religion
in providing some guidance for this journey and
an appeal to the common values inherent in ‘love, justice or
humaneness’.
Whether religion, law and science can develop the
‘creative partnership’ hoped for by Smith remains to be seen. What
is clear is that a shared commitment to human rights and social justice can
provide an ethical framework for decision-making about
contemporary challenges
and may prove that our diverse world has more points of commonality than we
