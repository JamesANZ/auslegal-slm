INTRODUCTION
review Panel, James Burchnall (sitting President), Louise Higgins, and Richard
Phillips, declined to conduct proceedings on an
application by Yowie in relation
to the affairs of Keybridge. The application concerned, among other things,
actions by Keybridge
seeking to convene a meeting to change the composition of
the Yowie board, which Yowie alleged constituted a frustrating action by
triggering a condition of Yowie’s announced off‑market takeover bid
for Keybridge. The Panel considered that there was
no reasonable prospect that
it would declare the circumstances unacceptable.

is an ASX-listed company (ASX code: YOW).
holds a relevant interest in approximately 58.07% of Yowie.
directors of Keybridge are Messrs Geoffrey Wilson AO, Jesse Hamilton, Martyn
McCathie, Sulieman Ravell and Antony Catalano.
directors of Yowie are Messrs Nicholas Bolton, John Patton, Andrew Ranger,
Diesel Schwarze and Daniel Agocs.
1 April 2025, a section 203D
was given to Yowie on behalf of Keybridge specifying an intention to move
resolutions for the removal of Messrs Patton, Bolton
and Ranger from the Yowie
board at the next general meeting of Yowie.
9 April 2025, a second section 203D notice was given to Yowie on behalf of
Keybridge specifying an intention to move resolutions
for the removal of Messrs
Schwarze and Agocs from the Yowie board at the next general meeting of Yowie.
Messrs Schwarze and Agocs
were appointed to the Yowie board after the first
section 203D notice was given.
24 April 2025, Keybridge sent a “notice of intention to nominate for
election” stating that it intends to propose and
nominate Messrs Wilson,
Hamilton, McCathie, Ravell and Catalano for election at a general meeting of
Yowie which occurs at least
30 business days from the date of the notice and at
which an election of directors is to be considered.
1 May 2025, Yowie released an ASX announcement stating (among other things) that
Yowie has no current plans to convene a general meeting to consider
appointments to the board and has not received any request from
Keybridge or
from any other shareholder to convene a general meeting for that
9 May 2025, Yowie announced an intention to make an off-market scrip takeover
bid for all the issued fully paid ordinary shares
in Keybridge, offering 1 Yowie
share for each Keybridge share on issue (
Proposed Bid
). The Proposed Bid
included the following condition 9 (
Condition 9
change to Yowie board composition
[Keybridge], its directors, officers or associates do not:
(a) Issue a notice pursuant to section 249D, 249F or 249G for the purpose of
convening a meeting of Yowie shareholders; or
(b) Propose a resolution at a meeting of Yowie shareholders; or
(c) take any actions,
that would influence the control or composition of the Yowie board of
16 May 2025, Keybridge made an ASX announcement advising its shareholders to
‘take no action’ in relation to the Proposed
Bid, and that it
intended to call a section 249F meeting of Yowie (
Section 249F
19 May 2025, in response to an ASX Query Letter which referred to Yowie’s
ASX announcement of 1 May 2025, Yowie stated (among
other things):
[n]one of [the section 203D notices of 1 and 9 April 2025 and the
notice of 24 April 2025] were validly sent to Yowie by Keybridge
as they had not
been authorised by Keybridge or its Administrator
(b) in relation to the section 203D notices of 1 and 9 April 2025,
Yowie is aware that the court gave relief to certain non-executive
directors of Keybridge from their restrictions under s. 198G of
prohibiting the use of their power, which would have enabled them to call and
arrange a board meeting and put certain resolutions
at Keybridge whilst it was
in administration. However, Yowie notes that it is also aware that no such board
meeting occurred and
the notices cannot have been sent by the company with the
parties having executed them having no delegated authority of the company
so. Yowie refers to s. 128(4) in this regard
(c) in relation to the notice of 24 April 2025, “
Yowie has confirmed
with the administrator of Keybridge that s. 198G approval was not granted for
the purpose of sending an intention
statement and that he did not authorise the
issue of any intention statement. In any event, there was no valid Board meeting
authorising
the sending of such notice. Accordingly, it could not have been
issued by Keybridge
23 May 2025, Yowie made the initial application seeking a declaration of
unacceptable circumstances. Yowie submitted (among other
Keybridge is seeking to take steps to frustrate the Offer by,
wilfully on its own volition, triggering Condition 9(a) of the

to convene a s.249F meeting of its Bidder until after the conclusion
Offer, other than to frustrate the Offer
(c) the acquisition of control over Keybridge is not taking place in an
efficient, competitive and informed market, contrary to section
or about 26 May 2025, Keybridge issued to Yowie a notice of general meeting
dated 26 May 2025 convening the Section 249F Meeting
for 27 June 2025 to
consider resolutions including to remove Messrs Bolton, Patton, Ranger, Schwarze
and Agocs as directors of Yowie
and to appoint Messrs Wilson, McCathie,
Hamilton, Ravell and Catalano as directors of Yowie. The notice of meeting
stated that Keybridge
“has significant concerns in relation to the
actions of the Removal Directors as regards total failures of corporate
for the Company and their directors’ duties.”
2 June 2025, Yowie made an ASX announcement advising that Keybridge had
purported to send
” a notice under section 249F to Yowie
shareholders and that, to the extent the purported meeting was valid, the Yowie
has resolved to postpone it to 14 July 2025 and change the venue.
4 June 2025, Keybridge commenced proceedings against Yowie in the Supreme Court
of New South Wales (Proceedings No. 2025/00213618)
Court Proceedings
seeking declarations and orders regarding the Section 249F Meeting, including a
declaration that the purported postponement of the
meeting by Yowie on 2 June
2025 was invalid.
13 June 2025, Yowie released on ASX a copy of its bidder’s statement in
relation to the Proposed Bid.
on 13 June 2025, the initial Panel decided not to make a declaration of
unacceptable circumstances. The initial Panel considered
(a) Yowie was aware of the likelihood that Keybridge may seek to change the
composition of the Yowie board when Yowie announced its
Proposed Bid, and
accordingly the condition was likely to be triggered by Keybridge and
(b) Keybridge’s actions did not give rise to unacceptable
circumstances.
APPLICATION
17 June 2025, Yowie requested the President’s consent to apply for a
review of the decision by the initial Panel pursuant
Yowie submitted (among
other things) that:
(a) the initial Panel had fallen into potential error, including on the
following bases:
erred in placing probative weight on s203D notices that were
not issued by Keybridge, but rather by WAM appointed directors of
appears to have concluded that these notices
were effective notices of Keybridge’s intention to convene a general
Yowie shareholders for the purposes of replacing Yowie's directors
and therefore that Yowie was aware of this before it launched
its takeover bid
for Keybridge.
(ii) to the extent that it formed the view in reaching its conclusion that the
Proposed Bid was illusory, not genuine or otherwise
designed for a purpose that
was inconsistent with the principles in section 602 and
(iii) by failing to properly investigate and take into account Yowie’s
contention that the WAM appointed directors of Keybridge
improperly participated
in decision making of Keybridge in response to the Proposed Bid
(b) new evidence was now available including:
(i) Yowie’s bidder’s statement, which provides important information
and detail in relation to the Proposed Bid including
the final structure of the
bid and the conditions of the bid as well as the potential benefits to Keybridge
shareholders of accepting
the Proposed Bid and
(ii) Yowie’s submissions of 15 June 2025 in the Court Proceedings, which
among other things contain important information concerning
what Yowie submits
are Keybridge's improper motivations for seeking to replace the board of Yowie,
that being, to avoid Keybridge's
present obligation to repay a $4.6m loan
(c) were the new evidence available to the initial Panel, that Panel may have
reached a different decision, or at least would have
made further enquiries of
the parties that may have resulted in it reaching a different decision and
(d) there are “
genuine and serious legal and factual matters raised
which are contested”
and if these matters are not considered by a
review Panel there is a real risk that the purposes of Chapter 6 may be
undermined to
the detriment and prejudice of both Yowie and Keybridge
shareholders.
Interim orders sought
did not seek interim orders.
Final orders sought
sought final orders that the general meeting of Yowie shareholders convened by
Keybridge (and subsequently postponed by Yowie)
be further postponed.
PRESIDENT’S CONSENT
President’s approach to consenting to a review is guided by the following
considerations:
(a) that it is a policy underpinning section 657EA(2) that there should be a
prompt conclusion to Panel proceedings
(b) whether there was any potential error in the sitting Panel’s decision
(c) whether there is any other basis for granting consent, for example, if there
is new evidence, the importance of the dispute,
whether there would be material
prejudice to any party by consenting or by withholding consent, and the merits
of the sitting Panel’s
President considered that the issue concerning the submitted ineffectiveness of
the section 203D notices was unusual. In addition,
without reaching a
conclusion on whether there was any potential error in the sitting Panel’s
decision, he noted that Yowie
had pointed to new evidence which he considered
could potentially have a bearing on the decision. He decided it was appropriate
to provide consent to the review.
have considered all the material, including the material before the initial
Panel, but address specifically only those materials
we consider necessary to
explain our reasoning.
received a preliminary submission from Keybridge submitting that we should
decline to conduct proceedings. The preliminary submission
noted that on 20
June 2025, Black J had delivered judgment in the Court Proceedings and made
declarations including that Keybridge’s
section 203D notices and director
nomination notice were valid.
Keybridge submitted that information submitted to the Panel in the review
application “
directly contradicts
” both the evidence Yowie
provided in Court, and the Court’s findings in relation to that evidence.
We refer to more
specific submissions by Keybridge below.
the time of our decision we did not have the benefit of the initial
Panel’s reasons for decision, which at the time were
still being prepared.
However, we note that the role of a review Panel is to conduct a de novo
, so while it is always
Frustrating action
Panel’s guidance on frustrating actions states that a frustrating action
is unlikely to give rise to unacceptable circumstances
where the frustrating
action is announced before the bid or potential
set out above, Keybridge gave Yowie section 203D notices for the removal of
Yowie directors and a notice of intention to nominate
new directors to Yowie
prior to Yowie announcing its Proposed Bid on 9 May 2025. Yowie submitted that
these notices were not legally
effective. In particular, Yowie submitted in its
review application that:
(a) the initial Panel failed to take into account established corporate
governance principles that would require decisions of Keybridge
to be made by
the Keybridge board, not just by “
select non-executive directors of
Keybridge without the approval of the Keybridge board”
(b) the initial Panel may have erred in failing to recognise the significance of
the fact that Yowie was entitled to disregard the
section 203D notices received
from Keybridge as ineffective under section 128(4), and that at its highest,
this demonstrated that
certain WAM appointed directors of Keybridge
wished for Keybridge to issue s203D notices
”, which of
itself was insufficient to form a conclusive basis for Yowie to become aware of
Keybridge’s wishes or intentions
concerning convening a general meeting of
its shareholders.
its preliminary submission, Keybridge submitted that the initial Panel had not
fallen into error in relation to Yowie’s awareness
of Keybridge’s
intention to convene a general meeting of Yowie shareholders, pointing to (among
other things):
(a) the Court’s transcript from the hearing on 18 June 2025 in the Court
Proceedings where Mr Ranger stated “
since 24 April
response to a question regarding how long he had known that Keybridge proposed
to call a section 249F meeting and
(b) paragraphs 6, 7, 12 and 20 of Black J’s judgment in the Court
Proceedings including his Honour’s finding (at [20])
that Yowie’s
denial in its response to the ASX Query Letter “
that it or its
directors had been made aware that a person or persons holding more than 50% of
its ordinary shares intended to call,
or requested the directors to call, a
general meeting to appoint or remove directors of [Yowie]...was plainly false or
at best highly
also submitted that the Proposed Bid had a “
collateral improper
”, namely to “
dilute Keybridge prior to [the] Yowie
249F Meeting and entrench [the] Yowie board
”, with reference to
paragraphs 27, 77 and 78 of Black J’s judgment in the Court Proceedings
including his Honour’s
finding that “
[Yowie]’s directors
plainly knew that [Yowie]’s takeover bid for [Keybridge] was structured to
seek to dilute [Keybridge]’s
shareholding in [Yowie], if [Keybridge]
shareholders accepted that bid
note Black J’s declaration (made shortly after the review application was
lodged) that Keybridge’s notices were valid.
At the time of our decision,
we had been informed that Yowie had filed an application for appeal of Black
J’s decision in
the Court Proceedings. Leaving this to one side,
notwithstanding Yowie’s submissions that it was not legally aware that
may seek to change the composition of the Yowie board when Yowie
announced the Proposed Bid, we agree with the initial Panel that
Yowie was aware
in a commercial sense. This is supported by the extracts of Black J’s
judgment in the Court Proceedings and
the transcript to which we were referred
by Keybridge in its preliminary submissions, although we reach our view
independently of
those materials.
Note 12 states that factors the Panel will have regard to in considering whether
a frustrating action gives rise to unacceptable
circumstances include
...any clearly stated objectives of the bidder and whether the
triggered condition is commercially critical to the
provides that a frustrating action is unlikely to give rise to unacceptable
circumstances if the bid or potential bid does
not give shareholders a
genuine opportunity to dispose of their shares
example, because, due to a condition or structural or other feature, it cannot
be implemented or completed.
Submissions
were sought on these aspects of the guidance in the proceedings before the
initial Panel. Yowie submitted to the initial
Panel as follows (among other
(a) The Proposed Bid is a “
genuine bid that provides Keybridge
shareholders with a viable alternative to the current situation whereby
Keybridge is only solvent
by virtue of the temporary funding provided by WAM
(which has a maturity date of 31 August 2025)
(b) Yowie’s purpose for bidding is for a “
genuine commercial
imperative including reaching a sensible resolution to its outstanding debt in
default which benefits both it and
Keybridge. Yowie is also seeking control of
certain strategic assets of Keybridge that will be beneficial to Yowie’s
(c) Given that Keybridge owns a material stake in Yowie, Condition 9 is
important to prevent the current Keybridge board taking steps
to replace the
existing Yowie board with its own nominees which would allow it to effectively
kill the Proposed Bid.
(d) Condition 9 also critically ensures that section 259C is not enlivened by
the operation of section 259E.
There is no collateral purpose... The Panel recognises a need to
structure a bid with conditions to comply with s. 259C in Alinta
[2006] ATP 15.
(f) As the Proposed Bid is a scrip bid, accepting Keybridge shareholders will
see their voting interest in Yowie increase rather
than reduce. It is
accordingly counterintuitive for the Proposed Bid to be used to defeat or delay
a change of board, when, by its
very structure it enables Keybridge shareholders
to increase the control they have over Yowie.
[A]ny delay in the eventual composition of the Yowie board is a
product of the requirements of the
Corporations Act
, rather than
submitted to the initial Panel as follows (among other things):
That the Purported Bid was not intended to proceed is evidenced by
factors including that Yowie has provided no rationale for the
bid, the sheer
number of conditions imposed as well as those specific to preventing shareholder
[T]he Purported Bid includes a number of conditions incapable of
satisfaction and the bid is not ‘genuinely available’
shareholders. Collectively, these conditions render the Purported Bid illusory
The bid has been designed to engage the Panel’s policy on
frustrating action, with the current application from Yowie representing
abuse of process. Yowie is using the fig leaf of the Purported Bid and its
corresponding Panel application as part of the many
excuses for Yowie to
frustrate and delay the Yowie 249F Meeting...
Yowie has offered no explanation (sensible or otherwise) at all as
to why a financial services investment company and a chocolate
manufacturer
would ever want to combine, or why such a transaction would make sense to the
shareholders of either entity, let alone
why a board change is commercially
note that, as set out on page 54 of the bidder’s statement, the 50.1%
minimum acceptance condition referred to in the 9 May
2025 announcement was
replaced with a 35% minimum acceptance condition and the condition in relation
to an ASIC exemption under
section 259C(2)
was replaced with a condition that
Keybridge “no longer controls Yowie” (within the meaning of

having regard to the bid conditions. In particular,
we had concerns in relation
to Condition 9 as updated in the bidder’s
and we were not
persuaded that it was commercially critical to the
consider that our concerns regarding the structure of the Proposed Bid are
supported by the extracts of Black J’s judgment
in the Court Proceedings
referenced by Keybridge, although we note that those paragraphs focused on
Yowie’s improper purpose
in postponing the
Section 249F
Meeting and did
not expressly state that the Proposed Bid itself had a “collateral
improper purpose”.

supplied with its review application a copy of its defendant’s submissions
dated 15 June 2025 lodged on behalf of Yowie
in the Court Proceedings where
(among other things) it was asserted that Keybridge’s true motivation in
seeking to change Yowie’s
board composition was the improper purpose to
avoid repaying $4.6 million owed to Yowie
its preliminary submissions, Keybridge submitted that its intention in calling
Section 249F
Meeting was to replace the Yowie board. It referred to
paragraphs 53 to 55 of Black J’s judgment in the Court Proceedings
including “
...[t]he evidence to which [Yowie] refers does not allow the
inference that [Keybridge] has any such [improper] purpose to be drawn,
is at least equally if not more likely in the relevant circumstances that
[Keybridge]’s true motivation is, as it
says, is to replace directors of
[Yowie] in which it lacks confidence
”. Given there was insufficient
evidence in the Court Proceedings for an inference to be drawn that Keybridge
was seeking to
change Yowie’s board composition to avoid repaying money
owed to Yowie (noting the court’s evidence gathering powers),
considered that there was little (if any) prospect we would reach a different
view on this point. Even if we were able to draw
such an inference, we did not
consider that this would necessarily be unacceptable in the circumstances of
this matter. Accordingly,
we did not consider that making further inquiries
into Keybridge’s intentions in calling the
Section 249F
Meeting was
also provided with the review application a copy of an email from
Keybridge’s lawyers to Yowie’s lawyers of 15 June
2025 noting that
Keybridge intended to contend in the Court Proceedings that Yowie's postponement
Section 249F
Meeting was for the reason that “
Yowie hoped to
dilute Keybridge's voting power prior to any such meeting taking place,
including via the dilution contemplated by
the bidder's statement
Yowie submitted that this constituted an acknowledgement by Keybridge of the
validity of the Proposed Bid and “
implies Keybridge's purpose of
frustrating the continuance of the bid
”. Even if this email did
constitute such an acknowledgement by Keybridge, we do not accept that
Keybridge’s actions
amounted to unacceptable frustrating action.
light of the above, while the actions of Keybridge in calling the
Section 249F
Meeting may have technically amounted to a frustrating action, we do not
consider there is any likelihood we could find that this
was an unacceptable
frustrating action.
Insider participation
the review application, Yowie submitted that consistent with Guidance Note 19:
Insider Participation in Control Transactions
, the WAM appointed
directors of Keybridge should not have any involvement in considering or
responding to the Proposed Bid. It further
submitted that those directors
should not have had any involvement in approving the issue of the
section 249F
notice which triggered a defeating condition of the Proposed Bid and that this
plainly unacceptable
submissions to the initial Panel, Yowie submitted (among other things) that
[i]f Yowie is successful in its bid, the WAM directors will be
displaced and inevitably their loan (which was entered into after the
intention was announced) will likely go into default

presented WAM with an inevitable conflict.

WAM was providing funding to Keybridge

committee to respond
to any genuine takeover bid
further submitted to the initial Panel (in rebuttals):
(a) The letter of comfort dated 12 February 2025 was offered by WAM Active as an
interim measure of providing comfort to Keybridge’s
newly appointed
directors to resolve any concerns as to Keybridge’s solvency if the
administration at the time were to be ended.
(b) The long form documents for Keybridge’s bridge funding facility from
WAM Active Limited and other entities within the Wilson
Asset Management Group,
were negotiated by Mr Ravell and Mr Catalano on behalf of Keybridge.
(c) Mr Catalano and Mr Ravell are independent of the Wilson Asset Management
Group. Mr Ravell had been nominated by WAM Active as
a Keybridge director
candidate and at the time had disclosed, for the avoidance of doubt, any
technical association that might have
arisen from him consenting to that
nomination.
what Keybridge acknowledges in paragraph

circumstances here to leave to Keybridge, at least at first instance, the
