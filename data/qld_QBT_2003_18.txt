REASONS FOR DECISION:
Introduction
On 21 January 2003, for reasons delivered
that day, the registrar was directed to release the sum of $17,222.07 then held
in the trust
account of the tribunal to the solicitors for the applicant. The
order was made following the splitting of the claim from the counterclaim,
respondents having conceded that they owed the sum of $17,222.07 in respect of
the claim. The applicant was also awarded interest
in accordance with the
contract on unpaid monies.
For reason delivered on 17 March 2003 the
respondents were awarded $2,000 in respect of their counterclaim.
The parties’ were given the
opportunity to make written submissions in respect of costs of the proceedings.
The respondents
did not take up that opportunity.
Submissions - Applicant
On 24 March 2003 submissions were made on
behalf of the applicant. It was submitted that the tribunal should order the
respondents
to pay the applicant’s costs of the
proceedings;
in respect of the costs order
of 21 January 2003, on an indemnity basis, as agreed, or failing agreement to be
assessed by the tribunal;
in respect of
the balance of the claim and counterclaim, all reasonable costs, as agreed or
failing agreement as assessed by the tribunal.
It was submitted that the applicant had
made offers to settle in accordance with Division 8 of Part 6 of the
Queensland Building Tribunal Act
2000 (“the Act”) with the
consequence that section 161 of the Act mandated the order sought.
It was submitted that the applicant had
made three offers to settle in accordance with Division 8 of Part 6 of the Act
on 24 October
2002, 14 November 2002 and on 20 January 2003. It was submitted
that the decision was not more favourable to the respondents than
contained in both the letters of 24 October and 14 November 2002. It was
submitted that paragraphs 1 and 2 of each offer
were essentially to the same
effect as orders 2 and 3 made on 21 January 2003.
It is submitted that the offer to carry
out works recommended by Mr Griffiths being the making good of cladding to the
exterior of
the refrigerator extension and the making good of the bathroom
architrave to the upper level corresponded in value substantially
to the work
that the tribunal ordered the applicant to carry out pursuant to order 1 made on
17 March 2003.
It is further submitted that although no
provision was made in the offers for payment of damages by the applicant to the
respondents
that the sum of the damages, that is $2000, is less than the cost
incurred and which were to be foregone at the time of the making
of each of the
It was submitted, relying on the
guidelines identified in section 61 of the Act, that the respondents should not
be entitled to any
order for costs on their counterclaim. It was submitted that
although the claim was for $42,528 that as a result of concessions
made on the
second day of the hearing it was effectively reduced to $30,376.22 and that the
respondents failed almost entirely in
their counterclaim. It was submitted that
although the applicant was ordered to undertake minor rectification work he had
to do the work and the only reason it had not been performed was that the
respondents denied him access to do so. It was submitted
that the $2,000
damages awarded to the respondents was insignificant in respect of the size of
Submission – Respondents
No submissions were made by the
respondents.
Up to the date of the offer, and indeed
generally, the tribunal’s power to award costs is found in section 61 of
Queensland Building Tribunal Act
The applicant’s case was a strong
one as evidenced by the capitulation of the respondents during the hearing.
There is no reason
that the applicant is not entitled to his costs of the
proceedings. The only matter for determination in relation to the costs of
applicant is whether he has obtained the benefit conferred by section 161 of the
Each of the offers complies with Division
8 of Part 6 of the Act. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of each offer were essentially to
the same effect
as orders 2 and 3 made on 21 January 2003. Although the work
the applicant was directed to perform is not identical to the work
he offered to
perform it seems clear that the cost of doing what was ordered would be less
than the cost of the work recommended
by Mr Griffiths.
No provision was made in the offers for
payment of damages by the applicant to the respondents. Each offer was made in
full and final
satisfaction of the issues in dispute. I accept the submission
that the sum of the damages awarded on the counterclaim, that is
$2,000, is less
than the costs incurred which the applicant offered to forgo at the time of
making of each of the offers.
Had the respondents accepted either offer
they would have been in a better position which they now occupy. The purpose of
161 is twofold: to encourage the making of good offers and to encourage
careful consideration of offers to settle as the consequence
of refusal of a
good offer is an inevitable order that the party refusing pay the costs of the
offerer. In not accepting the offer
made to them, which was a good offer in
that it would have given them a nett outcome better than the outcome at the
hearing, the
respondents have only themselves to blame for the Act operating
against them.
As the requirements of section 161(1) of
the Act have been satisfied I have no option but to award the applicant all
reasonable costs
incurred by him in conducting the proceedings after 24 October
2002. This will include the costs thrown away by the adjournment.
The respondent’s case in respect of
defects was of substance, but as soon as the applicant rectified the defects he
was prepared
to rectify, the substance of their claim fell away. As the
respondents enjoyed some success albeit minimal I am prepared to award
costs of the counterclaim on Magistrates Court scale C and costs of engaging the
termite management expert.
The respondents will pay the
applicant’s costs up to 24 October 2002 to be agreed or failing agreement
to be assessed by reference
to Magistrates Court Scale F.
The respondents will pay the applicant
all of his reasonable costs after 24 October 2002 to be agreed or failing
agreement to be assessed.
The applicant will pay the respondents
the costs of the counterclaim to be agreed or failing agreement to be assessed
by reference
to Magistrates Court Scale C and the costs of obtaining reports and
advice from Mr Langley.
