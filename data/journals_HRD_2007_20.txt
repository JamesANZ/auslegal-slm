Claudia Tazreiter
This issue of the Human Rights Defender focuses on the
so-called ‘second generation rights’ – economic, social and
cultural rights. This set of rights is often contrasted
with but inherently
linked to the civil and political rights that constitute ‘first
generation’ rights. Second generation
rights are regularly compromised,
bartered with and overlooked by states and by non-state actors, such as
transnational corporations,
despite their impact on the quality of life of most
Many arguments – largely based on resource
allocation – have been used to oppose the implementation of economic,
and cultural rights. In addition, those who seek to benefit from these
rights have limited means of
them. Individuals must be
confident that institutions exist to realise their rights and that other
mechanisms and organisations
will independently monitor this process. In the
last decade we have seen renewed efforts to address the deficit in socioeconomic
rights through various strategies aimed at extreme poverty alleviation and
tackling the rampant inequalities evident in all parts
of the world.
A cogent example of how domestic legal architecture can enliven international
norms such as those set out in the
International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights
(ICCPR) and the
International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights
(ICESCR) is seen in South Africa. In the first
article in this issue, Sandra Liebenberg considers the way in which the new
South African
Constitution
sets out a holistic approach to socio-economic
rights; making it unique from many other State jurisdictions. Former President
Mandela had argued that by prioritising first generation rights, a
dehumanising of populations occurred by obscuring the deep structural
inequalities that lead to extreme poverty in the form of socio-economic
‘rightlessness’. In her instructive article,
Liebenberg sets out the
growing evidence that jurisprudence in South Africa, drawing on the new
Constitution
, has brought tangible benefits in ESCR fulfilment. The cases of
extending the provision of anti-retroviral treatment for people living
HIV/AIDS; social security benefits for non-citizens; and protections for people
facing evictions from their homes are explored
to illustrate these developments.
The articles that follow consider ESCR from various perspectives. Susan
Mathews examines recent debates and tensions in development
aid and its
effectiveness in poverty reduction. These debates have often been conducted as
if quarantined from human rights norms.
Mathews demonstrates the way in which
even the monolithic financial and funding organisations, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the World Bank have in recent years recognised the
efficacy of having human rights thinking at the centre of their deliberations
aid, development and debt.
Jessica Montell’s article gives a very human face to ESCR with an
account of life for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
The article centres
on the flow-on effects from the restrictions on movement placed on the
Palestinian population; restrictions which
have increased over a period of 17
years. The restrictions on movement – justified by the Israeli Government
as security measures
– have affected such diverse activities as education,
work, access to health care and contact with family. This article puts
measured case for the security of both Israelis and Palestinians through
upholding fundamental human rights protections in a balanced
A troubling aspect of human rights protections is the extent to which
non-state actors can be held accountable for abuses of human
rights. Luke Taylor
tackles the legal remedies that are available to individuals and local
populations for infringements of ESCR
by transnational corporations –
remedies that are predominantly sought through domestic, private law, given that
international
law remains insufficiently nuanced to deal with non-state actors.
By exploring cases such as the Union Carbide Gas plant disaster
in Bhopal, the
Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea and the operations of Occidental Petroleum in
Peru, the article highlights possibilities
for challenging TNC impunity for
human rights abuses.
Julia Mansour considers Australia’s record on ESCR. Taking as her point
of reference some South African cases outlined by Sandra
Liebenberg, and cases
in India where ESCR litigation has extended the protections of local peoples,
she demonstrates the lack of
protections available to Australian citizens.
Australia’s failure to implement fundamental rights for Indigenous
Australians
– such as access to adequate primary health care and access to
water – remains a shocking reality for many Indigenous
The fast approaching Beijing Olympics have focused our attention in recent
times on the human rights record of the host nation. A
human rights issue that
has faced all countries hosting such large mega-events is the impact they have
on vulnerable local populations.
This is the topic of Claire Mahon’s
article, focusing on housing rights. From a local perspective, Sydney cannot
claim to have
struck a ‘rights balance’ as host of the 2000 Olympic
games. Since that period housing prices have risen dramatically,
with the poor
and minority groups being disproportionately affected.
The last article focuses on an issue unrelated to ESCR. Brigit Morris
evaluates the forthcoming Khmer Rouge Tribunal in Cambodia as
delivering a modicum of justice to this post-conflict society. There have been
diverse approaches to post-conflict reconciliation,
from South Africa’s
Truth and Reconciliation Commission to the Bosnian war crimes processes. For
Cambodians the process of
justice and reconciliation takes a new turn in early
Special thanks go to Luke Taylor (student editor and intern) for his
dedicated and tireless work. We hope you enjoy this issue of
Human Rights
and look forward to your continued readership in 2008.
