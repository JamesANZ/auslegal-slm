RedeMont for the respondent
[1] This is an
originating application concerning the lawfulness of an infrastructure charges
notice. A declaration is sought pursuant
Planning and
Environment Court Act 2016
(“PECA”) that an infrastructure
charges notice, reference number LCC/377/2023 dated 17 July 2023, purportedly
by the respondent (“the ICN”) is invalid and of no effect.
Further, a consequential order is sought pursuant to
of the PECA that
the ICN be set aside.
background to this matter begins with the Minister for State Development,
Infrastructure, Local Government and Planning making
a designation under ch 2
Planning Act 2016
(“PA”) identifying land at
6–8 and 10–12 Nestor Drive, Meadowbrook (“the premises”)
for the development
of infrastructure, namely “hospitals and healthcare
services” (“the hospital”). The Ministerial Infrastructure
Designation (“the MID”) was notified on 1 July 2022 and took effect
on that date. As a consequence, pursuant to
of the PA the hospital became
“accepted development”,
which is “development for which a development approval is not
uncontentious that the effect of the MID was to make a material change of use of
the premises as that term is defined in sch
2 of the PA, being “the start
of a new use of the premises”.
[3] Subsequently,
in order to build the hospital, a private certifier issued a building works
approval dated 20 June 2023 (“the
building approval”). This in turn
led to the ICN, which was expressed to be in respect of the “Building
Works Approval”.
[4] The first
applicant is the owner of the premises and a related entity of the second
[5] Pursuant to
development is defined broadly in sch 2 as
development
(a) carrying out—
(i) building work; or
(ii) plumbing or drainage work; or
(iii) operational work; or
(b) reconfiguring a lot; or
(c) making a material change of use of premises.
Section 280
then restricts the meaning of the term for an infrastructure charge and
infrastructure charges notice. In
the term “the development”
is stated to be a reference to “the development that is the subject of the
development
approval to which the charged matter
of the PA defines a “development approval” as a preliminary
approval, or a development permit or a combination of both.
It is uncontentious
that the MID is not a development approval as defined in the PA. It is equally
uncontentious that the ICN was
issued in accordance with the respondent’s
Logan Charges Resolution (No. 11) 2023
and no issue is taken in respect
of the calculation of the charge in the sum of $704,029.49.
[8] What is
contentious is whether the respondent had the power to levy the infrastructure
charges the subject of the ICN. The resolution
of this question requires a
careful consideration of ch 4,
, div 3, sub-div 3 of the PA.
Section 119
requires that a development approval be given before the levying of a charge and
the giving of an infrastructure charges notice.
Thereafter,
limitations on the levying of a charge. It states:
of levied charge
(1) A levied charge may be only for
extra demand placed on trunk infrastructure that the development will generate.
(2) When working out extra demand, the demand on trunk infrastructure
generated by the following must not be included—
(a) an existing use on the premises if the use is lawful and already taking
place on the premises;
(b) a previous use that is no longer taking place on the premises if the use
was lawful at the time the use was carried out;
(c) other development on the premises if the development may be lawfully
carried out without the need for a further development
(3) However—
(a) the demand generated by a use or development stated in subsection (2) may be
included if an infrastructure requirement that applies,
or applied to the use or
development, has not been complied with; and
(b) the demand generated by development stated in subsection (2)(c) may be
included if—
(i) an infrastructure requirement applies to the premises on which the
development will be carried out; and
(ii) the infrastructure requirement was imposed on the basis of development of
a lower scale or intensity being carried out on the
(4) In this section—
charges notice
(a) an infrastructure charges notice; or
(b) a notice stated in
section 125(3).
infrastructure requirement
means a charges notice, or a
condition of a development approval, that requires infrastructure or a payment
in relation to demand
on trunk infrastructure.
circumstances where the applicants argue that the demand placed on the trunk
infrastructure as a consequence of the MID is
the same as that as a consequence
of the building approval and the respondent makes no meaningful submission to
the construction of sub-ss (1) and (2) which is pivotal to the resolution of
this proceeding. Because pursuant to
a development approval is a
pre-condition to the levying of an infrastructure charges notice, the reference
to “the development”
in sub-s (1) must be a reference to the
building approval, having regard to
Then applying
context of the facts before me, there is no extra demand placed on trunk
infrastructure that the building approval will generate
over and above the MID.
In both cases the hospital is what will generate the demand on trunk
infrastructure. As noted above, the
use of the premises for a hospital became
accepted development as a consequence of the MID.
necessary to then consider
s 120(2)(c).
In this regard, the term “other
development” must be development different to the building work the
subject of the building
approval. On the facts before me, it must be the
material change of use effected as a consequence of the MID which made the
accepted development. Subsection (2) requires that when working out the
extra demand on trunk infrastructure, the demand generated
by the use of the
premises as a hospital must not be included “if the development may be
lawfully carried out without the need
for a further development permit”.
In my view, “the development” referred to in this passage is a
reference to
the “other development” earlier referred to, which on
the facts before me is the material change of use for the hospital.
On one view,
this use may be lawfully carried out without the need for a further development
permit. On another view, this use required
the building of a hospital and
therefore the building approval in order for it to be carried out.
attempting to resolve this conundrum, assistance can be found in the
Interpretation Act 1954
, which relevantly states in
the interpretation of a provision of an Act, the interpretation that will best
serve the purpose of the Act is to be preferred
to any other interpretation.
permits extrinsic material, including an explanatory note
relating to the Bill, to be considered in assisting in the interpretation
provision. In this regard, the explanatory note to what became s 120 of the PA,
which was cl 119 in the
Planning Bill 2015
(Qld), relevantly stated:
ensures that a levied charge is only levied for additional
demand placed on trunk infrastructure by a development.
The clause prevents the existing lawful use of a site or the existing rights
to develop a site from being considered additional demand,
infrastructure requirement that applies or applied to the use or development has
not been complied with.
[12] Having
regard to the explanatory note, it is clear to me that because the use of the
premises for a hospital became accepted
development as a consequence of the MID,
s 120(2)(c) does not permit the infrastructure charges the subject of the ICN to
on the granting of the subsequent building approval. This
interpretation is consistent with s 120(1). It is also consistent with
120(2) read as a whole, which requires existing use rights (regardless of
whether they are active) to be credited in working out
any extra demand
occasioned by the development to which the infrastructure charges notice
unpersuaded that there are discretionary reasons which should deny the
applicants the relief they seek. Accordingly, I declare
that the infrastructure
charges notice, reference number LLC/377/2023 dated 17 July 2023, purportedly
issued by the respondent is
invalid and of no effect. I order that the
infrastructure charges notice be set

To the extent that the term
was construed in
Douglas Construction & Engineering Pty Ltd v Logan City
[2023] QPEC 28
without regard to the definition in s 280 of the PA,
it does not represent good law.
Given the MID Plan of
Designation included a "built form envelope comprising buildings and structures
not exceeding 4 storeys, ground
floor car parking and vehicular
circulation”, this is hardly surprising. See the Certificate of the CEO
of the respondent
filed 15 April 2025, Document 1, at page 14.
