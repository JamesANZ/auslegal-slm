REASONS FOR DECISION
[1] On 21 July 2009, the Guardianship and the
Administration Tribunal (the Tribunal) conducted a hearing in Brisbane in
relation to
CAD. This hearing considered a guardianship application submitted by
his sister, GK.
[2] At the same time, the Tribunal conducted a review of the appointment of The
Public Trustee of Queensland who had been appointed
by the Tribunal as
CAD’s administrator until further order. This appointment was made on 28
[3] The Tribunal also considered an application from MG, from the Department of
Communities – Disability Services seeking the
appointment of GK as
guardian for a Restrictive Practice. It is this latter application which is the
subject of these Reasons.
[4] CAD was born in February 1963 in Brisbane. He currently lives in northern
Brisbane in a rented facility and receives twenty-four
hour support from
Disability Services Queensland. CAD has been in residential care with the
Queensland Government’s Disability
Services for many years.
[5] CAD has very limited ability to make decisions for himself and requires
assistance in most activities of daily living. He has
difficulty in making
himself understood.
[6] Present at the hearing was GK, sister, CS, manager from the Department of
Communities - Disability Services and MG, the applicant
also from the same
department.
[7] When considering whether to appoint a guardian for a Restrictive Practice
matter, the Tribunal is governed by
section 80ZD
Guardianship and
Administration Act 2000
(the Act), this provides as follows:
80ZD Appointment
(1) The tribunal may, by order, appoint a guardian for a restrictive
practice matter for an adult if the tribunal is satisfied—
(a) the adult has impaired capacity for the matter; and
(b) the adult’s behaviour has previously resulted in harm to the
adult or others; and
(c) there is a need for a decision about the matter; and
(d) without the appointment—
(i) the adult’s behaviour is likely to cause harm to the adult or
others; and
(ii) the adult’s interests will not be adequately protected.
(2) The appointment may be on terms considered appropriate by the
[8] In this matter, the Restrictive Practice proposed was the use of physical
restraint. Physical Restraint is defined in the
Disability Services Act
Section 123E
- Definition as follows:
physical restraint
, of an adult with an
intellectual or cognitive disability, means the use, for the primary purpose of
controlling the adult’s
behaviour, of any part of another person’s
body to restrict the free movement of the adult.
[9] The Tribunal had received in written evidence a health professional report
from Dr B who was CAD’s general practitioner
for past four years. In his
report to the Tribunal dated 21 May 2009, Dr B writes that due to an
intellectual impairment, “CAD
has no ability or understanding of the
consequences of a decision or lack of a decision in relation to Restrictive
Practices.”
The Tribunal canvassed Dr B’s opinion with the parties
at the hearing and all agreed that CAD did not have the capacity to
decisions about the use of Restrictive Practices. The Tribunal found that CAD
had impaired capacity for the matter under consideration,
that is, for making
decisions about the use of physical restraint.
[10] The Tribunal also heard evidence from the applicant, MG and from his
sister, GK, that from time to time, CAD would hit people
including both staff
and his co-tenants, causing harm. He would also self abuse, by running into
[11] The Tribunal was supplied a Physical Restraint Support Plan which included
a Restrictive Practice Transitional Assessment by
Disability Services. This
document outlined the physical restraint currently used with CAD which has been
in use for some time and
proposed to be used in the future. It consisted of four
steps, commencing with an attempt to identify the source of CAD’s distress
which initially was indicated through his making whistling, clapping or buzzing
noises, including stomping his feet and slapping
walls. The staff would use
verbal prompts initially to attempt to stop this behaviour and also consider
whether he was experiencing
a physical ailment. If CAD continued to escalate or
exhibited aggressive behaviours, the procedure was that staff would intervene
asking CAD to go outside to the back patio. If he did not respond, staff would
physically prompt and redirect CAD to move outside.
The procedure outlines how
he would be physically prompted to move outside by needing “to guide him
by standing off to the
side and behind him and place one hand on his arm and
your other hand in the middle of his back --- and walk in a forward direction
---.” The Tribunal was given a demonstration of how this occurred by MG
[12] The key question for the Tribunal was whether the practice being used,
constituted Physical Restraint. The Tribunal heard that
CAD is not a frail
individual and it was highly likely, that he would if he wanted, be able to
extract himself from the physical
prompts being used. That being so, the
Tribunal was not convinced that a key element of Physical Restraint, that is,
the restricting
of the free movement of CAD was in fact occurring.
[13] The Tribunal was advised that CAD was highly compliant with going to the
outside patio area and was now being directed verbally
on occasions to which he
was responding, without the need to physically direct or guide him. The Tribunal
was satisfied that CAD
was not being physically restrained, but being physically
guided in a way which did not prevent him from using any part of his body.
other words, his free movement was not being restricted. If he wanted to move
his arm that was being held, he was able to do so.
[14] This, of course, contrasts with physical restraint, whereby a
person’s arms or arm is held in such a way, that the person
is unable to
move his or her arm. This is clearly does not apply when staff are redirecting
CAD to the patio.
[15] The Tribunal therefore dismissed the application for the appointment for a
guardian for Restrictive Practice on the grounds
that there was no need for an
appointment because there was no restrictive practice being applied. Section 80
ZD(1)(c) was not satisfied.
