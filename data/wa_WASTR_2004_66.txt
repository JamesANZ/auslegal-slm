3 The Strata Plan was registered on 12 June 1996 pursuant to the

5 The parcel is a ten-lot single-storey brick and tile residential development
at 57 Scaddan Street, Bassendean.
6 According to the Strata Plan, the address for serving notices on the Strata
Company is c/- Blackburne & Co, 1050 Hay Street,
West Perth, WA 6005. If
that is no longer the address for the service of notices on the Strata Company,
the Strata Company should
arrange to have the Strata Plan amended to show the
correct address.
Orders sought
7 The Applicant has sought an Interim Order and a Principal Order against
Kathleen Ann Sims, as the proprietor of Lot 4 on
Plan in the
following terms:
“... that Kathleen Ann Sims removes a fallen tree from the front yard of
Unit 4/57 Scadden Street, Bassendean WA and that Ms
Sims has a silky oak tree
removed from the front yard as well. Also I would like to see the front yard
tidy up. Ms Sims will bear
the total cost of this. I would like to see this
done within three months please...”
8 In relation to the requested order for the payment of costs, s 81(7)
prohibits me from making an Order in relation to the
of the application but
the 1985 Act allows me to make orders in relation to the costs of any works
that may be required
to comply with any order that I might make.
9 Pursuant to s 42(2), in the absence of any notification of any amendment
or repeal of or any addition to the by-laws, the
of the Strata Company
standard” by-laws in Sch 1 and Sch 2.
10 The Applicant has referred to Sch 1, by-law 1(1)(b) which obliges
a lot proprietor to
“repair and maintain his/her lot and keep it in a state of good repair,
reasonable wear and tear, and damage by fire, storm,
tempest or act of God
11 He has also referred to Sch 1, by-law 1(2) (b) which obliges
a proprietor, occupier or other resident of a lot
“not use the lot or permit it to be used in such manner or for such
purpose as causes a nuisance to any occupier of another
lot (whether a
proprietor or not) or the family of such an
Applicant's
submissions
12 The Applicant has provided me with a photograph of the silky oak tree
referred to by him, together with information which identifies
grevillea robusta
, known in North America as a “silk oak”.
The Applicant refers to it as a silky oak.
13 The photograph provided by the Applicant shows a very tall tree with many
leafy branches.
14 The Applicant has provided a photocopy of a report from the Forest Service
of the United States Department of Agriculture which
describes silky oak trees
as fast-growing trees which can reach 75 feet or more, with a 25 foot
15 The report concludes
“A great quantity of leaves fall in the spring immediately preceding the
emergence of new growth and leaves also fall sporadically
throughout the year,
creating a litter problem to some people... Silk oak works as a specimen in
large, open landscapes but should
not be located near houses due to their large
size, messy habit, and the brittleness of the wood as it ages. Tops of trees
to snap out of the tree in high winds.”
16 The Applicant claims that the leaves from the tree have blocked up the
gutters of his Lot 5. Even though he has installed
mesh in his
gutters, it only has a limited effect.
17 He is also concerned about the damage that the roots of the tree may be
doing to any pipes within the parcel and he asks
“if this tree falls onto my house during a storm, will it be classed as an
act of God and that is not covered by
insurance?”
18 Further photographs provided by the Applicant show leaf-filled gutters on
his lot with the leaves being those of the silky oak
19 Another photograph shows deep leaf litter under and over a wide area around
the base of the tree.
20 Other photographs show some leaf litter on the driveway, but this does not
appear to be very extensive.
21 Finally, the Applicant has provided photographs of a very substantial tree
that has fallen over close to the silky oak. The
branches and leaves on the
tree are dead.
22 There is no indication of any attempt to clean up any of the leaf litter or
to remove the dead tree.
Lot boundaries and
exclusive use areas
23 Each lot in the scheme comprises a residence and surrounding land. All lots
have frontages to an internal common property driveway
which runs from the
Scadden Street frontage of the parcel almost to the rear of the parcel.
24 The Applicant’s Lot 5 is at the south-western corner of the
parcel, immediately south of, and adjacent to, Lot 4.
25 The Strata Plan contains the following
endorsements
“The stratum of that portion of the lot external to the building extends
between 5 metres below and 10 metres above the upper
surface of the ground floor
of the respective adjoining units.
External faces of buildings as per approved building plans, are boundaries of
Considerations
26 The tree is growing on an external portion of Lot 4. The upper limit
of that external portion is 10 metres above the upper
of the floor level
of the Lot 4 residence. This means that, to the extent that the tree may
be higher than that 10
metre upper limit,
it would be protruding into common
property air space which is owned by all lot proprietors and which cannot be
used without the
approval of the Strata Company.
27 Section 81 allows me to make, as an Interim Order, any order that I can make
as a Principal Order but I can only exercise that
power in situations of
urgency. I understand the Applicant’s concerns about the untidy
appearance of the leaf litter and the
fallen tree and the problems with leaves
in his gutters and on his driveway, but I do not believe that it is a situation
s 82 applies. This view is re-imposed by the Applicant’s
suggestion that the respondent be given three months to carry
any necessary
28 Accordingly, I propose to dismiss the application for the Interim Order but
an invitation will be extended to the other lot proprietors
through the Strata
Company, to make any submissions in response to this application. On the face
of it, there do appear to be issues
raised by the Applicant that warrant further
investigation and
consideration.
29 My Order is relation to the Interim Order sought is that
“The application for an Interim Order be
dismissed.”
