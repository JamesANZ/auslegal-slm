Scott's Executors v. Dobson [1843]
solicitor, action against, succession, trusts, equity
Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land

, 21 November 1843
Mr. Fleming appeared for the plaintiffs, and Mr. Montagu for the defendant.
In this case the plaintiffs, executors of the late Dr. Scott, called upon the Court to order the defendant, Mr. John Dobson,
solicitor, and who had been engaged to act as their professional adviser and agent in all matters relating to the trust, to produce
an account, on the ground of mis-application of the funds received by him, and in having detained the sum of Â£621 18s.
8d. for alleged services performed by him, and which ought to have passed to the credit of complainants. To this the defendant put
in a demurrer to the entire bill, which now came on for argument.
After Mr. Montagu for the demurrer, had been heard at great length, Mr. Fleming addressed the Court in favour of the application.
The learned gentleman had not concluded his address at four o'clock, when the Court adjourned.
The argument will be resumed this day (Tuesday.) We defer a report until our next.
Pedder C.J. and Montagu J., 3 December 1843
Hobart Town Advertiser
, 8 December 1843
The Court, this morning delivered judgment. The case had been ably argued by Mr. Fleming, for the plaintiff's and
replied to by Mr. Montagu. As it is one of more than ordinary interest and importance, we give a brief summary.
Mr. Dobson, the defendant, was engaged by the executors of the late Dr. Scott, (Dr. Bedford and Major De Gillera), to
act in his professional capacity as a lawyer, in all matters relating to the trust. Mr. Dobson commenced an action against the executors,
for a general balance of Â£752 11s. 6d. and Â£637 9s. 9d.,for costs, in his professional capacity including
both sums in the same summons. The executors filed a bill in equity for an account, and to stay the proceedings at law, impeaching
the items in his account, and also impeaching several items in the bill of costs. To this bill Mr. Dobson put in a general demurrer
for want of equity; that is, that the bill did not disclose such a case as to call for the interference of a court of equity.
Mr. Montagu in arguing for the demurrer, denied the jurisdiction of the Court, and cited numerous cases.
Mr. Fleming, after replying to the arguments of Mr. Montagu, supported the bill in equity for an account on four grounds;
first, the general concurrent jurisdiction of the court to account; secondly, that jurisdiction, as resting upon account, being taken
more conveniently in equity than at law; thirdly, that the court should interfere for the avoiding of multiplicity of suits; and,
fourthly, that the court had jurisdiction to account, as resting upon the fiduciary character on which the parties stood. As to the
general concurrent jurisdiction of the court to account, the learned counsel urged many arguments, and cited several cases. The account,
he contended contained numerous items unsettled and [???] to, none of which came within the principle recognized in Triestas v. Dios
Santos. The defendant had in his bill, charged the plaintiff with what he pleased; discharged himself as he thought proper, and brought
an action for the balance. To shew that this could not be sustained, the learned gentleman cited the Corporation of Carlisle v. Wilson,
(which he read at length), from 13 Vesey, 276; White v. Williams 8 Vesey, 193 and 194 and many other reports from the law books.
On the second ground that the bill should be supported, and that the account could be taken more conveniently at equity than at law,
Mr. Fleming contended there was no form of pleading under which the plaintiffs could obtain benefit. In support of this numerous
cases were quoted, but which, from the difficulty of hearing in the reporter's box, we could not obtain. On the third ground,
of the decision of the court to avoid multiplicity of suits, the learned counsel contended that it was utterly impossible to make
a defence, in a case like this, adequately for a court of law, - no form of common law pleading would admit of it. The plaintiffs
complained of payments, out of the trust funds, of money paid for simple contract debts, instead of judgment debts; and also, of
appropriation, to his own account, of balance of purchase money; and further, the plaintiffs complained of overcharges; of money
wrongfully paid; and in these cases, as well as many others, in taking their remedy at law, the plaintiffs must have cross-actions
against the defendant. The litigation would be almost interminable. On the fourth ground, the jurisdiction of the court to account
rested upon agency and receivership by the defendant. In support of this, several cases were quoted. The defendant, the learned gentleman
observed, had paid the simple contract, instead of the speciality creditors; he had reserved the balance of purchase money for his
own demands; and what were the executors to sue for? Of the charges against the defendant was this:- Dr. Scott, in his life-time,
gave his accommodation to Mr. Joseph Henry Moore, for 245
; this bill the executors were obliged to retire, which they did by discounting a bill at the Derwent Bank. The executors placed entire
faith in Mr. Dobson, the defendant, he having been the confidential advisor of Mr. Scott, in his life-time, and consequently acquainted
with that gentleman's affairs. One of the executors being a physician, and the other a retired officer, could not, of course,
know what was proper to be done in complicated matters of law. They, however, instructed Mr. Dobson to bring an action against Moore,
for the amount of the late Dr. Scott's accommodation to him, and which they had retired. The action proceeded to execution, which
they urged upon Mr. Dobson to enforce. For some reason, however, Mr. Dobson agreed to stay further proceedings, and made an arrangement
with the executors, that he (Dobson), would pay the bill which they had discounted at the Derwent Bank, and secure the executors
from all costs of the action which they had brought against Moore; he (Mr. Dobson) obtaining from Moore an indemnity to secure himself.
Nevertheless, in the account before the court, Mr. Dobson debited the executors with the sum of 254
13s. 4d.; charged by him as paid for the said bill, and also with 70
for costs. There were several other items, adverted to by the learned counsel, in which the defendant was charged with malversation.
The prayer of the bill in equity was, that the defendant may account for all the estate and effects he has received.
The Chief Justice, in a very long judgment, coincided entirely with the law as laid down by Mr. Fleming, and said the
defendant must account.
Mr. Justice Montagu entirely coincided with the Chief Justice. The executors had entrusted the defendant to manage their
affairs, relying upon his skill, as a professional man, to pay the speciality, instead of the simple contract creditors, that he
had not done this might be from mistake; but the arrangement which the defendant had made with Moore, amounted to a great deal more
than a mere mistake; Mr. Dobson knew the effect of that arrangement, and in his opinion it amounted to a positive fraud. The defendant
must account.
The demurrer was disallowed; the effect of which is that Mr. Dobson must answer the bill in equity, and account to the
executors before his action can proceed.
