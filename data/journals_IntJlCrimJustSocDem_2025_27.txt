Introduction
article considers a critical issue at the convergence of culture, human rights,
and sexual assault against women. In Zimbabwe,
as in several parts of the world,
cultural customs and traditions often conflict with the reporting and management
of rape cases.
This causes substantial difficulties for survivors seeking
fairness and support (Mutanana and Gasva 2015). The Lupane rural district,
other rural areas in Zimbabwe, has cultural and spiritual traditions and norms
that influence the reporting of rape cases. These
cultural and psychosocial
factors include societal norms across gender roles, attitudes towards sexual
violence, stigma associated
with survivors, and methods for resolving conflicts
within the community.
This study sought to comprehend the non-reporting of rape cases in Lupane
District, and a comprehensive method was used to explore
both cultural elements
and human rights perspectives. As one point of view, cultural practices deter
survivors from reporting rape
due to fear of retribution, social exclusion, or
diminished trust in proper justice systems. From another standpoint, human
contexts including international agreements and Zimbabwean legislation
advocate survivors' rights to access justice and support services,
fundamental right to live free.
In Lupane District, the dominance of Ndebele tribe men reinforces gender
inequality, placing women in lesser societal roles (Ndlovu-Gatsheni
Aggressive behaviour by men is often excused as masculinity, overlooking women's
rights (Ghebretekle and Rammala 2018). Customary
laws frequently fail to uphold
women's rights (Baloyi 2017) and, according to Wood (2019), African societies'
inability to protect
women fosters patriarchal norms and violence against women,
including rape. This cultural backdrop impedes women's rights and deters
reporting, perpetuating gender-based violence. Rape in rural Zimbabwe echoes a
complicated relationship of historic, traditional,
and social and political
aspects, guided by Christian theories, pre-independence legal systems, and
post-independence nation-building
endeavours. These elements characterise
insights of rape, specifically within the context of marriage, where
understandings of Christianity
may either encourage gender equality opportunity
or strengthen male-controlled norms. Pre-independence legal legacies and
socio-political
structures hierarchise male property rights and family stability
over women's sovereignty, enabling latitude for violence against
Understanding these dynamics is critical to inform policy and practice

Literature Review
The study aims to explore the factors that influence the non-reporting of
rape cases. The discussion that follows analyses published
and unpublished
literature and other relevant sources on the non-reporting of rape. The
definitions of rape, and moral judgement
on rape survivors and perpetrators, are
analysed. Rape perceptions and gender attitude roles are also presented. Factors
with the non-reporting of rape generally speaking from a perspective,
in a context are examined, with a particular focus on the rural
Zimbabwe. Non-reporting factors embedded in the literature survivors'
perspectives, rape myths from an African perspective,
and studies examining
myths in Zimbabwe—are reviewed. Literature is explored on why women in
rural areas chiefly Africa and
Zimbabwe would not report rape, regardless of
their knowledge of the definition of rape.
The definition of rape has progressed, with substantial legal patterns
modelling its interpretation. In the matter of the
Prosecutor v Akayesu
before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in 1998, rape was
defined as "a physical incursion of a sexual nature,
committed on a person under
conditions which are intimidating" (Weiner 2013). This definition extended
beyond traditional perceptions
of rape, recognising coercion beyond physical
force, incorporating intimidation and threats. Nevertheless, this definition
with section 65 of the
Zimbabwe Criminal Law (Codification and
Reform) Act
(Chapter 9:23) which confines rape to occurrences involving male
perpetrators and female victims. In Zimbabwe, rape is defined as:
... a male person knowingly has sexual intercourse or anal sexual intercourse
with a female person and, at the time of the intercourse
(a) the female person
has not consented to it; and (b) he knows that she has not consented to it or
realises that there is a real
risk or possibility that she may not have
consented to it ... (
Zimbabwe Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act
(Chapter 9:23), s. 65(1)
Notwithstanding legal divergences, attempts have been made to address
extensive forms of sexual violence under Section 66 of the same
Act (Alvarez
1999; Weiner 2013).
Moral Judgement and Rape Perceptions
Rape is perceived as a serious offense, leading to negative moral judgments
against perpetrators. Gender role attitudes often influence
blame attribution in
cases of rape (Angelone, Mitchell and Lucente 2012). Traditional communities
tend to uphold gender norms that
portray women as submissive, and blame
survivors while excusing perpetrators, perpetuating rape myths (Angelone et al.
2012). These
attitudes are shaped by social norms endorsing men's sexual
dominance and women's subservience (Flood and Pease 2006).
Moral Judgement on Rape Survivors and Perpetrators
Moral judgment involves making decisions based on defined moral principles
and conforming to them (Van Vugt et al. 2011). Society
often holds stereotypical
views of rape survivors, condoning men's aggression against women. This stems
from survivors' character
analysis and moral judgment, influenced by
pre-existing ideologies that overlook the circumstances of the rape. Niemi and
Young (2014)
suggest that moral judgment ideologies toward rape survivors are
shaped by various factors, such as societal norms regarding gender
Rape Perceptions and Gender Role Attitudes
Esina et al. (2018) elucidate gender roles and attitudes, highlighting the
conflicting views that motivate men's inclination to sexual
assault and rape. In
contrast, an egalitarian perspective advocates for gender equality and equal
rights (Angelone, Mitchell and
Grossi 2014). Individuals adhering to traditional
gender roles perceive men as dominant and assertive, while women are viewed as
submissive and reluctant to engage in sexual activities (Ben-David and Schneider
2005). This adherence to traditional norms may contribute
to the tolerance of
rape in society.
Intersections of Culture and Rape
Ogunbode, Bello, and Ogunbode (2014) identify cultural norms in patriarchal
societies as facilitators of rape, where survivors fear
stigmatisation and
prioritise traditional norms over reporting. There is also hesitance to
criminalise intimate partner rape, with
a preference for family harmony over
legal action (Lievore 2003). Leaders may minimise rape's severity, blocking
survivors from seeking
justice (McCleary-Sills et al. 2013; Šimonović
2020), especially in rural areas with deep-seated attitudes that both normalise
rape and deter legal recourse (Lewis 2003).
Factors Associated With the Non-Reporting of Rape From a Global
Perspective
Factors related to non-reporting of rape among women differ broadly across
diverse cultural, social, and economic perspectives worldwide.
Knowing these
factors is necessary to improve intermediations addressing barriers to reporting
and aiding sexual violence survivors.
We now deliberate key elements linked with
the non-reporting of rape among women from a global view, drawing on current
literature.
Stigma and Shame: Amongst substantial barriers to reporting rape is the
stigma and shame correlated with being a sexual violence survivor.
assault survivors might fear judgment, blame, or social exclusion if they
divulge their encounters. Ahrens, Stansell and Jennings
(2010) and Ullman and
Filipas (2001) highlight the prevalent impact of stigma on survivors' readiness
to report sexual violence and
seek support.
Fear of retaliation: Fear of retribution from offenders or their allies is
another predominant reason women may elect not to report
rape. Chadambuka and
Warria (2019) and Jewkes et al. (2012) accentuate the fear of future violence or
harm as a major deterrent to
reporting amongst survivors.
Lack of trust in authorities: Numerous survivors have scepticism and
uncertainty about law application and the sympathetic and efficient
of rape cases by justice systems and support services. Studies by Mannell et al.
(2018) and Mashiri and Mawire (2013)
exhibit the value of developing confidence
and assurance in institutions to persuade survivors to step forward and report
Cultural and religious beliefs: Cultural and religious theories can impact
survivors' perceptions of rape and reporting tendencies.
In certain communities,
male-controlled norms, gender imbalance, and victim-blaming attitudes may
possibly inhibit survivors from
frankly expressing themselves. Jewkes et al.
(2009) and Gibbs et al. (2017) highlight the role of cultural factors in
influencing
victims’ responses to rape.
Legal and structural barriers: Legal and structural barriers, such as
intricate legal systems, inability to access legal aid, and
limited support
services, can impede survivors' propensity to report rape and pursue justice.
Studies by Rennison (2002) and Logan
et al. (2007) point out the significance of
tackling these universal hurdles to enhance reporting rates.
Trauma and psychological effects: Rape survivors may possibly experience
substantial distress and emotional anguish, which can affect
their resolve.
Research by Anderson and Overby (2020) and Dardis et al. (2018) features the
enduring impacts of suffering on survivors'
welfare and their hesitancy to
involve recognised reporting practices.
The study by Kalra and Bhugra (2013) shows a noteworthy percentage of rape
cases assessed at between 67% and 84% are not reported,
due to the delicate
nature of the crime thereby making it challenging to precisely measure the
pervasiveness of rape and the extent
of the problem. In spite of legislative
restructurings in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi,
Lesotho, and South Africa to widen the definition of rape, survivors
still display disinclination to report occurrences. Women's
rights groups
estimate that up to 95% of cases go unreported (Seelinger, Silverberg and Mejia
2011). Furthermore, a study across
10 countries revealed that 55% of women who
experienced sexual abuse elected not to report it, with only 15% of rape victims
United States reporting the offense (Seelinger, Silverberg and Mejia
In conclusion, the under-reporting of rape among women emanates from a
combination of stigma, fear, distrust, cultural norms, legal
obstacles, and
trauma. Addressing these factors demands an inclusive approach that initiates
conversations on structural imbalances,
augments survivor-centered support
services, and questions societal attitudes toward sexual violence.
The Reasons for the Under-reporting of Rape, in the African Context and
in the Rural Areas of Zimbabwe
Previous studies extensively explored the reasons for the under-reporting of
rape, shedding light on various contributing factors,
particularly in African
contexts and in rural Zimbabwe. Acknowledging these aspects is critical for
effective interpositions to address
reporting barriers and support sexual
violence survivors. Studies by Jewkes et al. (2012), Gibbs et al. (2017), Nduna
et al. (2010),
and Chikwiri and Lemmer (2014) underscore the patriarchal
societies, gender inequality, and stigma that silence rape survivors.
Fear of reprisal and the social stigma associated
with rape dissuade survivors from pursuing help or reporting cases to the
Chadambuka and Warria (2019) and Machakanja, Jerenyama, and Bere (2016)
emphasise fear of retaliation, victim-blaming attitudes,
and concerns about
Zimbabwean communities.
Structural factors, such as accessibility and responsiveness of justice and
support services, also influence reporting decisions.
Mashiri and Mawire (2013)
stress the importance of strengthening institutional responses, providing
survivor-centered services, and
addressing gaps in the legal framework to
enhance reporting rates and support survivors effectively.
In rural areas, limited access to healthcare, legal assistance, and law
enforcement agencies further impede reporting. Nzaumvila and
Mabuza (2015)
highlight challenges of geographical isolation, resource constraints, and
inadequate infrastructure in rural Zimbabwe,
hindering survivors' access to
essential services and justice.
In general, these studies highlight the complicated interplay between
cultural, social, economic, structural, and psychosocial factors
contributing to
the under-reporting of rape in African communities, specifically rural Zimbabwe.
Tackling these hurdles requires
multiple perspectives with different approaches
to address cultural norms, reinforce institutional responses, and develop access
to support services for sexual violence survivors.
Non-Reporting Factors Embedded in the Literature: Survivors'
Perspectives
Sexual violence survivors frequently face complicated moral judgments,
societal stigma, and gender-based perceptions that influence
their choices on
whether to report rape. Ahrens, Stansell, and Jennings (2010) and Ullman and
Filipas (2001) emphasise the incorporation
of societal attitudes, leading to
feelings of guilt and self-blame amongst survivors. Negative perceptions of the
justice system,
as discussed by Mannell et al. (2018) and Mashiri and Mawire
(2013), can further erode trust and discourage reporting. Gender roles
dynamics within society play a substantial role in survivors' reactions to
sexual violence. Patriarchal norms contribute
to victim-blaming attitudes and
weaken survivors' support, as demonstrated by Gibbs et al. (2017) and Jewkes et
al. (2009). Cultural
convictions and attitudes surrounding rape vary across
communities, prompting survivors' decisions to divulge sexual violence. Jewkes
et al. (2012) and Gibbs et al. (2017) highlight the impact of cultural norms on
reporting barriers. Intersectional factors, including
race, ethnicity, class,
and sexual orientation, intersect with gender to shape survivors' experiences
and reporting likelihood. Marginalised
groups, such as women, face additional
barriers due to systemic inequalities and discrimination (Anderson and Overby
2020; Campbell
et al. 2001). In conclusion, survivors' choices to report are
shaped by moral judgments, justice perceptions, cultural views, and
dynamics. Accepting these elements is crucial for improving survivor-centered
acknowledgements that address extensive barriers
and support survivors in search
of justice.
Rape Myths from an African Perspective
Rape myths that rationalise sexual assault and victim-blaming are
strengthened by cultural norms and male supremacy dynamics in African
intensifying their harmful impact on survivors (Jewkes and Morrell 2010; Lonsway
and Fitzgerald 1994; Mashiri and Mawire
2013). These myths, incorporating the
idea that women should avert rape through their conduct or appearance, maintain
traditional
gender roles and shift the obligation of preventing assault onto
women (Jewkes and Morrell 2010; Mashiri and Mawire 2013). Such views
blame women for incitements through apparel or behaviour but also inspire them
to adopt surviving strategies like humility
or respect which are, in due course,
futile and preserve detrimental stereotypes (Jewkes and Morrell 2010; Mashiri
and Mawire 2013).
Addressing these myths requires dismantling patriarchal
conceptual elements, nurturing gender equality, and guaranteeing liability
perpetrators to support survivors and curtail sexual violence (Jewkes and
Morrell 2010; Mashiri and Mawire 2013).
Studies Examining Myths in Zimbabwe
Research on rape myths in Zimbabwe is insubstantial but provides insights
into societal attitudes towards rape. Fidan and Bui (2016)
investigated women's
understandings of intimate partner violence (IPV) and associated viewpoints.
Mashiri and Mawire (2013) centered
on legal aspects of rape in Zimbabwe,
elucidating societal attitudes. Sande and Chirongoma (2021) studied the
pervasiveness of rape
myths among Zimbabweans, showing their influence on
experiences of sexual violence. Furthermore, Siziba (2020) studied Zimbabwean
women in South Africa, exploring theories within the diaspora community.
Nonetheless, these studies did not entirely capture the
pervasiveness and
influence of rape myths across various regions and communities in Zimbabwe.
Traditional Forms of Justice in the African Context and
In Zimbabwe and across Africa, traditional justice systems prioritise
reconciliation and community cohesion over punitive measures,
employing various
methods to address offenses like intimate partner rape. Traditional justice
mechanisms to resolve rape disputes
include mediation by elders (Fidan and Bui
2016), community-driven family meetings, restitution by offenders (Sande and
2021), and apology rituals (Fidan and Bui 2016). Offenders may also
face social sanctions. While providing resolution pathways, these
prompt discussions on gender equality and human rights, highlighting the need
for survivor-centred approaches in diverse
cultural contexts.
Rape Non-Reporting by Women in Rural Zimbabwe and Africa, Despite
Understanding its Definition
In rural areas, including Zimbabwe and other parts of Africa, the
under-reporting of rape is complex, influenced by social, cultural,
and economic
factors. Survivors often fear stigma, judgment, or retaliation, leading them to
remain silent about their experiences.
Traditional gender norms and patriarchal
power structures place the burden of maintaining family honour on women,
prioritising community
harmony over justice for sexual violence (Fidan and Bui
2016; Mashiri and Mawire 2013). Practical barriers, such as geographical
distance, lack of transportation, and financial constraints, further hinder
survivors from reporting rape. Distrust of law enforcement
or perceptions of
corruption within the justice system may also deter survivors from seeking
assistance. Additionally, limited awareness
of legal rights and support services
in rural communities exacerbates survivors' reluctance to report sexual

storytelling, the researchers were able to garner a rich and deep narrative to
let the voice of the Lupane rural district
community be heard (Elçi and
Devran 2014). Africa has a legacy of oral history which is as ancient as its
existence (Butina
2015). Even to this day, historical information relentlessly
in African societies.
The researchers opted for interpretivism and constructionism, aiming to
comprehend the district's social world through the inhabitants'
perspectives and
interpretations. By employing an inductive approach that emphasises story
themes, they narrowed the study's scope
(Islam and Samsudin 2020). Qualitative
research, grounded in a constructivist worldview, was chosen, influenced by the
researchers’
familiarity with the study area. This background provided
insight into the participants' worldviews, shaping the study's design.
team's exploration of local cultural practices and proactive bracketing were
strategies to reduce research bias. Permission for
ethical clearance to conduct
the research was sought from the College of Law’s Ethical Clearance
Committee as guided by the
UNISA Policy on Research Ethics (2016). The
researchers received ethical clearance from the Ethical Clearance Committee of
the College
of Law, with the certificate ERC Reference No: ST124-2019.
A narrative methodology was chosen, mainly for its capacity to develop an
epistemological framework centring on knowledge and access
to challenging
questions through intersubjective negotiations (Collins and Stockton 2018). The
qualitative data collection was conducted
with consideration of intuitive
ethical issues around information gathering in the participants' homesteads or
working environments
(Moser and Korstjens 2018).
Participants
The study population comprised three groups, including 30 villagers (men and
women) aged 18 years and above from the Lupane rural
district resettlement area,
and 14 village heads who oversaw cultural matters and local governance
structures. Additionally, three
non-government organisations, including two
registered service organisations and one operating under the Numerical Church
Forum, were involved as depicted on Table 1 below. The Lupane rural
district consists of 14 villages with 1,386 homesteads, each
with an average of
eight individuals per family. Purposive, snowball, judgment, and convenience
sampling methods were employed to
select participants based on availability,
placement, schedules, and readiness (Lopez and Whitehead 2013). However,
gatekeeper permission
from the Commissioner-General of the Zimbabwe Republic
Police (ZRP) to interview ZRP personnel was not obtained. The perspective
personnel is crucial to fully understand the issue of non-reporting of rape,
given their role as the first point of contact
for survivors seeking justice and
support. By examining the experiences, attitudes, and practices of police
officers, researchers
had aimed to gain insights into the systemic barriers and
challenges that deter survivors from reporting rape.
The 30 villagers and 14 village heads in the study shared a homogeneous
socio-demographic context, including language, cultural beliefs,
values, and worldviews. Jager, Putnick, and Bornstein (2017) suggest homogeneous
convenience sampling involves purposely
restricting the sampling frame to
specific socio-demographic factors such as traditional beliefs, ethnicity, and
shared values.
The Lupane District population comprises peasant farmers and individuals who
have migrated illegally to neighbouring countries, primarily
South Africa. Many
of them engage in menial jobs, while others resort to criminal activities to
support their families back home.
Despite their lack of formal education and
qualifications, they are perceived as role models for their ability to provide

refusals. Female participants also sought approval from their husbands or
household gatekeepers to participate, ensuring
their involvement was consensual
and avoiding potential repercussions (Elias 2013).
Data Analysis
NVivo 9 software was used to automate tasks and identify trends, themes, and
assumptions efficiently (Hilal and Alabri 2013; Zamawe
2015), streamlining
transcription and enhancing accuracy and speed (Daher et al. 2017). The
methodology employed narratives to understand
human experiences, initially
summarising discussions into concise participant narratives (Riessman 2008),
then expanding them into
detailed accounts to explore cultural and human
dynamics (Smith and Sparkes 2009). Recurring themes were identified, focusing on
barriers to reporting rape incidents (Braun and Clarke 2006), including fear of
blame and judgment, fear of justice, and fear of
aftermath (Fisher and Pina
2013; Peter-Hagene and Ullman 2016). The thematic analysis uncovered
consistencies and patterns across
narratives, providing insights into
socio-cultural and psychosocial factors influencing reporting decisions
(Sandelowski and Barroso
2003). This iterative approach yielded a nuanced
understanding of unreported rape cases, revealing underlying complexities
and Pina 2013; Peter-Hagene and Ullman 2016).
The research findings elucidate the complex interchange between cultural
practices, human rights, and the non-reporting of rape cases
in the Lupane
District of Zimbabwe. In conformity with the literature review, the research
accentuated the importance of appreciating
socio-cultural and psychosocial
factors in determining survivors' decisions regarding reporting rape. As
highlighted in the literature
review, cultural norms, gender expectations, and
community attitudes profoundly influence survivors' experiences and responses to
rape, contributing to under-reporting globally, and specifically within African
contexts (Jewkes et al. 2012; Fidan and Bui 2016).
Cultural Practices and Non-Reporting of Rape
Participants noted stigma, fear of retaliation, and victim-blaming attitudes
in their communities, hindering survivors from seeking
justice and support. This
aligns with literature on cultural beliefs perpetuating rape myths, and blaming
survivors (Gibbs et al.
2017; Mashiri and Mawire 2013)
Human Rights Considerations
The research findings were scrutinised through a human rights lens. It became
apparent that the non-reporting of rape cases in the
Lupane District raises
critical human rights concerns. Survivors' rights to access justice, receive
support services, and be free
from biases are regularly compromised due to
cultural barriers and systemic limitations in the formal justice system. This
with the literature review, which underscored the importance of tackling
structural inequalities, promoting survivor-centered support
services, and
challenging societal attitudes toward sexual violence to sustain human rights
values (Mannell et al. 2018; Logan et
In the discussion, the researchers outline the theme, present diverse
responses, and incorporate participants' quotes. Employing introductory
to engage participants in defining rape according to the
Zimbabwe Criminal
Law (Codification and Reform) Act
(Chapter 9:23) facilitated participant
awareness and meaningful discussion on the topic.
Psychosocial Factors which Contribute to Unreported Rape Cases
Three subthemes emerged in the discussion on psychosocial factors influencing
the reporting of rape: fear of blame and judgement,
fear of justice, and fear of
aftermath (see Table 2). These psychosocial factors were used as characteristic
words or phrases to
describe and identify perceptions. The broad nature of the
subthemes allowed the researchers to effectively explore and understand
concepts related to the research question.
Table 2: Subthemes and their definitions (Source: Compiled by the
researchers)
Definitions
Psychosocial Factors
Fear of Blame and Judgement
Fear of being disbelieved and blamed.
Fear of being further attacked and having diminished emotional strength.
Fear of the Justice System
Fear of the unknown—not understanding the justice system or being in
denial about how it works.
Feeling that the justice system has no remedy for them.
Fear of corroboration requirements and testing of consent.
Fear of having their character probed—a form of
re-victimisation.
Fear of Aftermath
Cases are not reported because the survivor has been raped by a guardian or
close relative.
The psychosocial factors had subthemes that helped achieve a comprehensive
interpretation of the data and identify patterns in the
participants’
narratives. The theme highlights the narrative descriptions of position and
identity, clearly presenting the
participants’ stories. The researchers
used subthemes to describe the psychosocial factors, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Emerging subthemes from the theme psychosocial
factors (Source: Compiled by the researchers)
Psychosocial barriers to reporting rape, as identified by participants,
include self-blame and reduced awareness; reluctance to disclose
the rape to
family; legal issues affecting reporting, such as re-victimisation through legal
processes and fear of insufficient evidence;
cases involving rape by a guardian
or close relative; and fear of retaliation, especially if the perpetrator is a
breadwinner. Nearly
two-thirds of participants cited psychosocial factors as
obstacles to reporting rape.
Fear of Blame and Judgement
Fear of blame and judgement constituted the fear of being disbelieved,
blamed, further attacked, and having emotional strength diminished.
study, about a fifth of the participants revealed the fear of blame and
judgement as a barrier to reporting rape.
Self-blame and Diminished Awareness
Research findings from five participants revealed that rape survivors in the
district feared blame for reporting rape, deterring disclosure.
narratives often cast doubt on survivors' credibility, placing them at risk of
being accused of lying or consenting to
the assault. A male participant
described how women silently endure pain, hesitant to report rape due to
potential repercussions:
... the aunt's aggressive response to discussions about the rape deterred the
girl from reporting it. She feared her aunt would blame
her and chose to keep
the incident secret.
Five participants attributed self-blame to rape, indicating its association
with reduced disclosure. The participants suggested that
openly discussing rape
is seen as bringing shame to a household.
Does not Intend to Disclose the Rape to the Family
Findings from four participants revealed that dealing with the aftermath of
rape strains families. Some survivors avoid reporting
to protect their families
and maintain household peace, as one participant noted:
... and being in a prominent church position, she hesitated to report the
rape for fear of tarnishing her reputation .... She also
refrained from
reporting because she didn't want others to learn about her nightlife
activities, particularly her parents.
Survivors may not report rape due to cultural norms that stigmatise reporting
and further victimise them. In the district, women are
expected to adhere to
strict sexual conduct standards, leading to fears of reporting without family
support, social isolation, stigma,
blame, expulsion, or forced marriage to the
perpetrator. These cultural barriers significantly hinder rape reporting.
Fear of the Justice System
Six participants cited the justice system as a reporting barrier, focusing on
legal factors, such as the definition of rape and concerns
re-victimising survivors or leading to insufficient evidence. These findings
suggest a lack of confidence among
survivors in the district regarding the
effectiveness of the justice system.
Legal Factors Regarding the Definition of Rape and its Effect on
Non-reporting
Two participants highlighted that some rape cases go unreported due to a lack
of familiarity with the definitions and types of rape
among district residents
and survivors:
In our village, a 70-year-old man married a mentally challenged woman, and it
seems his relatives accept the situation.
Marriage and procreation by individuals with severe mental disorders are
legally prohibited. Consent cannot be coerced through misrepresentation
forced marriage, including marrying someone with severe mental illness. This
suggests that survivors may not report rape due to
a lack of awareness about
what legally constitutes rape.
Legal Processes as Re-victimisation
Two participants revealed that survivors experience secondary victimisation
during legal procedures post-reporting, discouraging further
Rape victims fear navigating the justice system alone, fearing disbelief and
lack of support.
Participants noted that survivors faced intrusive questioning by law
enforcement and prosecutors, lacking privacy and assurance of
protection. Additionally, authorities often made derogatory remarks about
survivors' attire during the assault and their
past sexual history, leading to
re-victimisation through the legal process.
Fear of Insufficient Evidence
Two participants highlighted the under-reporting of rape due to mental health
issues and trauma, as survivors' statements are perceived
as insufficient or
unreliable. They noted that survivors' narratives of sexual assault often lack
coherence. This raises doubts about
their credibility and reliability as the
responses do not conform to typical patterns of credible testimony. One
participant said:
... however, they refrained from reporting to the police, fearing the
mentally disturbed survivor would struggle to recount the rape.
Society expects rape survivors to exhibit visible signs of struggle, such as
screams and bruises, to be deemed credible. This perpetuates
the myth of the
'ideal victim,' reinforcing stereotypes about how survivors 'should' behave. Law
enforcement's lack of training on
rape and the emphasis on physical evidence
hinders effective support. The emphasis on physical signs of trauma reinforces
stereotypes about masculinity and femininity, further marginalising
survivors who do not fit the 'ideal victim' mould.
Fear of the Aftermath
Some cases remain unreported due to fear of repercussions. Participants
mentioned instances where the perpetrator was a guardian or
close relative,
silencing the victims. Fear of retaliation from the perpetrator or their family
and the perpetrator being a breadwinner
also deter reporting.
Survivors are Financially Dependent on Perpetrators
Financial dependence on perpetrators deters rape survivors from reporting,
echoing literature on barriers to reporting in situations
of rural poverty. This
dependence creates power imbalances, leaving survivors vulnerable and less
likely to disclose abuse. Perpetrators
exploit this to prevent reporting.
Limited resources and social inequality worsen the situation. Fear of
retaliation or economic
loss, especially from a spouse or family member, further
inhibits reporting. Cultural norms valuing family harmony over safety, and
patriarchal pressures to preserve family reputation also silence survivors,
prioritising social order and financial security.
An Unpleasant Act of Retaliation by the Perpetrator or his Family
Three participants indicated that survivors in the district are afraid of
retaliation, due to their close links to the perpetrator
or their family. This
cohesive community inhibits survivors from reporting rape to the police. Fear of
reprisal emanates from the
potential for a serious aftermath, including
recurring victimisation:
The survivor didn't report the matter due to fear of vengeance from the
traditional healer, and because she believed her parents wouldn't
trust her due
to their strong faith in him.
Survivors are reluctant to report rape to the police due to fear of reprisal.
This encompasses concerns about metaphysical repercussions,
impersonation of witchcraft. Two participants noted the weighty influence of
witch doctors, pastors, and prophets in the
district, whose orders are
incontestably respected. For instance, some churches approve marriages uttered
by prophets, irrespective
of the groom's age, resulting in young women marrying
much older men. This cultural perspective imparts fear in survivors, who believe
these figures have divine authority to punish them for resisting sexual
advances. The participants' versions highlight the continual
fear of retaliation
emanating from both sexual violence dynamics and the influence of powerful
figures in the community.
Recommendations
New Conversations
The research findings and discussion highlight the need for new conversations
on psychosocial factors that influence the under-reporting
of rape. Kothari
(2008) and Johnston (2014) advocate for exploring new questions in the
literature, thereby generating the spirit
of Ubuntu philosophy (Ghebretekle and
Rammala 2018). This pacificatory approach intends to argue factors contributing
to the under-reporting
of rape through amiable conversation and traditional
dispute resolution practices (Rammala 2021).
The Ndebele cultural norms assume women need to safeguard family honour by
obviating perpetrators (Rammala 2021). Therefore, these
recommendations
incorporate culturally profound interpositions addressing these norms.
Indigenous wisdom systems and practices, acknowledging
community principles and
merging cultural perspectives, should be initiated (Ghebretekle and Rammala
2018). Community-based education
and awareness campaigns are critical to
challenge societal myths and support structures that curtail victim blaming
(Rammala, 2021).
Conversations should aim to transform societal views on premarital sex and
support survivors' inclusion and respect within their families
and communities
(Ghebretekle and Rammala 2018). The establishment of community-based support
services, comprising psychotherapy and
legal backing, is fundamental to support
survivors' needs in rural areas (Rammala 2021).
Collaboration and cooperation among NGOs, grassroots organisations, and
community stakeholders are fundamental in addressing primary
drivers of rape
non-reporting (Ghebretekle and Rammala 2018). The susceptibility of women to
sexual assault and financial dependency
can be curtailed by empowering women
with knowledge and economic independence initiatives (Rammala 2021).
Comprehensive implementation of these recommendations can create safer
environments, promote perpetrator accountability, and sustain
the rights of
sexual violence survivors in the Lupane rural district of Zimbabwe (Ghebretekle
and Rammala 2018). Meaningful progress
in addressing the cultural practices and
human rights issues surrounding the non-reporting of rape cases can be made
through a collaborative
and sustained commitment.
Limitations and Directions for Future Research
Connell (2007) observed a structural partiality in social science knowledge
innovation toward Anglophone countries in the Global North.
Hence, this study
holds noteworthy value for knowledge creation in the Global South and the growth
of Southern criminology. Accepting
the restraints of current research on rape
non-reporting is vital for developing knowledge and improving interventions and
systems for victims. Future research directions can tackle knowledge
gaps and provide insights into developing issues and dynamics
around rape
non-reporting.
Research Limitations:
• Refusal by the Commissioner-General of the Zimbabwe Republic Police
to access information in their space impeded the addition
of significant police
perceptions.
• Research fixated on identifiable demographics, restricting
generalisability.
Recognising Future Research:
• Research on how community responds to non-reporting of rape:
Exploring how societies respond to non-reporting of rape, incorporating
examination of community norms, traditional convictions, and institutional
traditions. The responses may support victims to curtail
• Research on how technology and social media can enhance the reporting
of rape: Examining how online platforms may provide
support and advocacy, and
the role of technology in reporting decisions and accessibility of
The majority of incidences of rape in the Lupane District are not reported to
the police due to tensions between cultural practices
and human rights which
were extrapolated in the study. The research findings indicate Lupane District
village heads and residents
must be engaged in conversations to build awareness
of, and empowerment on, balancing cultural practices with human rights. This
will facilitate rape reporting to police and other community stakeholders who
can support survivors in a manner accommodating, and
grounded upon, Ndebele
