SIR EDWARD COKE AND THE ELIZABETHAN AGE
ALLEN D BOYER, STANFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 2003
Sir Edward Coke is a giant in Anglo-American constitutional history; he has thus
far defeated all those who might have attempted
a comprehensive biographical
study. Born in Norfolk in 1552, Coke progressed from Trinity College, Cambridge,
to the Inner Temple
in 1578, and from there established a reputation as perhaps
the foremost legal mind of his generation. Appointed solicitor-general
attorney-general to Elizabeth I, he was appointed chief justice of the Common
Pleas in 1606 and chief justice of King’s
Bench in 1613. Thereafter, his
outspoken advocacy of English law fuelled a reputation as a ‘great legal
oracle’ that
was only strengthened by Crown efforts to ‘rip up his
former life’, in the words of one contemporary, with his sacking
Bench in 1616. Coke’s participation in parliamentary debate in the 1620s,
in which the Forced Loan and other unpopular
fiscal measures were contested with
reference to ‘fundamental liberties’ enshrined in
Magna Carta
and elsewhere in English constitutional culture, heightened his reputation,
along with popular interest in ‘monuments of the
liberties’ garnered from his eleven
, published between 1600
and 1616, and from his four
– the last three of which
were only published during the Civil War with the breakdown of Crown
censorship.
It is the latter part of this long and controversial career that has drawn most
attention from historians. In Catherine Drinker Bowen’s
now badly-dated
The Lion and the Throne
(1957), which focused mostly upon court politics
and Coke’s professional rivalries, Coke’s legal viewpoint is
as fully formed. What was idiosyncratic about and what was typical
historians concerned with the coherence and currency of what John Pocock called
the ‘common law mind’. Here Allen
D Boyer offers a genuinely fresh
perspective on Coke’s life and learning, by focusing his attention upon
Coke’s ‘former
life’ in the years before 1603, relating his
formative influences and experiences to the intellectual and personal
characteristics
which prevailed in later life.
Boyer’s study of Coke’s life and legacy with respect to the reign of
Elizabeth I, the years in which Coke, in the author’s
‘acquired his learning’ and ‘set his course’, involves
some major scholarly challenges. First, the
author has to make accessible
Coke’s legal formation, which was itself the source of Coke’s
massive erudition and was
declared comprehensible, by Coke himself, only by
those trained in the English law. Second, Boyer has to find a place for Coke
two carefully argued and competing historical traditions. In the first,
‘Whig’ or ‘neo-Whig’ historiography
he is a champion of
constitutional liberties absorbed into British and American ideas of good
governance. In the other, ‘revisionist’
tradition Coke’s
utterances and ambitions are more narrowly seated within the faction-ridden
politics of the courts of Elizabeth
and James I. Boyer’s stated ambitions
Sir Edward Coke and the Elizabethan Age
are to place him as a
‘figure in a specific cultural landscape’, militating against the
typical emphasis upon ‘conflict
and controversy’ in Coke’s
parliamentary and legal career with an eye to ‘his ability to compromise
and collaborate’.
In this, Boyer attempts to remove Coke, who has carried
singular weight in teleological views of early Stuart constitutional breakdown,
from the exaggerations
which have beset previous
interpretations of his life.
Boyer traces Coke’s early life, putting flesh on the bones of ‘young
Ned Coke’ as a Norfolk man of ambition, with
some family connections and a
desire to follow his deceased father into a legal career. Coke’s career
progressed in relation
to a complex pastiche of clients and causes in which
Norfolk’s ‘country-bred phalanx’ of patronage was essential
his success, along with his qualities of ‘bookishness, tightfistedness,
the determination to rise, the readiness to see
others fall’. While he
obviously had little choice but to engage in the cut and thrust of local
politics if he were to rise
in society, Boyer shows that the law was always the
vehicle through which Coke made his presence felt.
The chapters devoted to Coke’s legal method and learning are in many ways
unsurprising, quoting judiciously from voluminous
and careful scholarship on
this subject. Boyer places most emphasis upon the symbiotic relationships at
work between a judge, received
legal wisdom, and courtroom process in
Coke’s ‘half-hearted’ theory of English law –
half-hearted, for Boyer,
because Coke’s abiding interest in legal practice
dominated his intellectual framework. Boyer sees Coke as less mesmerised
selective material from which he constructed his history of English legal
supremacy, and more calculating about their political
and propagandistic
purposes as ‘ideas were pressed into the service of a political
agenda’. He concludes that Coke willingly
adopted ‘radical,
unsupportable arguments’ (arguments which intimidated and infuriated his
detractors in later years)
armed with the ‘energetic pragmatism of Tudor
law, with its steely desire to measure judicial decisions by state
Breaking fertile and interesting ground, Boyer places new emphasis upon
religious issues in Coke’s formative years at the bar.
Noting his defence
of Puritan preacher William Flemming against open attack from the 1583 Norfolk
assize judges, he pursues Coke’s
characteristic willingness to pursue
legal arguments into potentially-damaging controversy. Aligning Coke’s
legal writings
with Elizabeth’s first Archbishop of Canterbury, Mathew
Parker, who argued that a ‘primitive’ English church had
Papal intrusion, Boyer finds Coke’s arguments for the untarnished descent
of ‘primitive’ English law full
of wishful thinking. Drawing from
the ideas of Parker, Coke becomes a prominent spokesman of what Boyer rightly
terms the ‘pathology’
of ‘immemorial custom’. Elsewhere
Boyer emphasizes Coke’s associations, extending from his favourite sister
and her husband Francis Stubbes, with Puritan circles. Though no Puritan
himself, Boyer suggests that Coke ‘vaguely but regularly
towards causes which were strongly Protestant’. Here the author draws
parallels between the dissenting tendencies
of lawyers and Puritans –
perhaps gentler and subtler, but tending to the same ‘revolutionary
implications’ (in
Boyer’s own words) suggested in the work of
Margaret Judson and more recently by others such as Wilfrid Prest.
An effective and often vitriolic agent of Crown interests in his years as
solicitor-general and then attorney-general, Coke served
in the front line of
the Queen’s defence against the perceived threat of Papistry, and against
those unfulfilled and embittered
courtiers who plagued her last years. Unlike
Sir Richard Hutton or Sir James Whitelocke Coke left no distillation, in journal
common place book, of his private views – although his tendency towards
personal reflection in voluminous published and unpublished
law reports have
always provided fertile ground for historical inference. Guided by the strengths
and weaknesses of the evidence
which attests to his role, Boyer’s Coke is
not always as present in the story as one would like in the chapters on his
service in the 1590s. Through the new emphasis Boyer gives to his early
life as an orphan of modest beginnings, Coke’s can
be seen as preeminent
among the ‘rising’ barristers who grew their wealth and influence
through the legal and parliamentary
machinery of Westminster. What comes through
clearly is his sensitivity towards the status of the law and thus his own
status, both
of which drew measured and at times caustic criticism from those
around him.
This is a good book, carefully researched and written in an accessible and
engaging style. It integrates the best recent scholarship
which brings light to
bear upon the historical milieu in which Sir Edward Coke rose to prominence. By
ending his study in 1603, Boyer
avoids some of the most difficult areas of
historical debate about Coke’s reputation, a reputation both developed and
under James I and Charles I in an atmosphere of growing political and
ideological distrust. Coke deserves a second installment from
the author, taking
him on from the Elizabethan era in which he made his name into the complex and
shifting political landscape of
the early Stuarts.
