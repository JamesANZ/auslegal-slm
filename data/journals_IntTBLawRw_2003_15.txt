Hassall, Douglas --- "Dal Pont: Law of Agency" [2003] IntTBLawRw 15; (2003) 8 International Trade and Business Law Review 429
By GE Dal Pont (Foreword by The Hon Justice Kevin Lindgren),
Butterworths, Sydney, 2001, ISBN 0 409 31655 5
This is a superb new book on the law of agency in Australia. It fills what
hitherto has been, apart from some excellent but shorter
treatments of the same
topic, a noticeable gap in Australian commercial law publications. It is
comprehensive, based, as its author
indicates in the Preface, on ‘the
reading of all 20th century Australian agency cases, as well as a significant
of English, Canadian and New Zealand cases of the same period.
Frequent reference and citation [being made] to English case law from
century and earlier’. This ‘and earlier’ will be welcome to
those legal practitioners and judicial officers
who, in the search for good
expositions of fundamental principle, seek beyond the usual historicist focus
upon the 19th century.
The latter is rather like the all too ready
identification of Victoriana with the truly ‘antique’. As in equity,
of the genuinely ‘classic’ judicial statements on the law of
agency were first made in the 18th century, or even earlier.
If the overemphasis on 19th century decisions is perhaps an understandable
tendency of the lawyers of nations like Australia, which
came of age and also to
self-government during that century, the book is not guilty of this. Instead,
Dal Pont’s mode of proceeding
is the sound one of providing a very clear
and concise exposition of the law, using a careful balance of the most
up-to-date contemporary,
the earlier modern and the premodern case law. Whilst
arrangement of the text into manageable numbered paragraphs is by no means
the author has followed the commendable path taken in Australian legal writing
by works such as Meagher, Gummow & Lehane’s
Equity: Doctrines and
and by (then Professor) Justice PD Finn, of the Federal Court of
Australia, and others. This endeavour is to state briefly the essence
principle animating the law or rule, referring to relevant case law and
indicating the nature of exceptions and qualifications;
and being alert to the
best—including even venerable—expositions of a principle, but
without unduly dwelling on the
historical discussion of its
development.
The book is structured in 26 chapters, arranged into eight parts under the
headings as follows: an introductory discussion on the
‘Context’ [of
the law of agency]; ‘Creation of Agency’; ‘Agent’s
Authority’; ‘Agent’s
Duties’; ‘Agent’s
Rights’; ‘Principal’s Relationship with Third Parties’;
Relationship with Third Parties’; and lastly,
‘Termination of Agency’, including an additional chapter on the
‘Revocation of Powers of Attorney’.
All chapters are equipped
with detailed footnotes referring to case law, statutory provisions, relevant
legal texts and learned articles.
The whole work is characterised by a wide
sweep of view, extending across not only the Australian and English cases
(although naturally
these predominate), but also taking in Canada and New
Zealand. The parts on creation and termination of agency are straightforward,
direct and brisk. The former is notable for its admirable setting of the law of
agency into context, by means of discussions on ‘Definition’,
‘Comparisons to Other Legal Relationships’, and the question of
‘Capacity’; likewise Part III on ‘Express
and Implied
Authority and Non-Delegation’.
The three succeeding parts: on ‘Agents’ Duties’ and
‘Rights’ and on the ‘Principal’s Relationship
Parties’, make up the bulk of the book. These parts each contain a
detailed exposition of the state of the law in
contemporary Australia,
illustrated by detailed references to (and quotation of key extracts from) the
case law, both leading and
incidental. A notable feature of the author’s
treatment is the strength of his discussion of the role of equitable principles
and remedies in relation to agency, seen particularly in Chapter 12 on
‘Duties in Equity’. Another notable feature, welcome
to Australian
practitioners, is the discussion of Secret Commissions Legislation in the
Australian States and Territories. Practitioners,
and especially advocates, will
find the author’s discussion of the agent’s standard of care, and
the question of the
extent to which Counsel can, or cannot, be regarded as an
‘agent’ of the client, of interest. In this regard, the author
inter alia,
to the judgment of Fullagar J in
Hansen v Marco
Engineering (Aust) Pty Ltd
[1948] VR 198
, (at 203).
Dal Pont acknowledges in the Preface that the law of agency is never static,
and he points to some very recent major Australian decisions
whose effect could
not be taken into account in this first edition, but which will fall to be dealt
with in the second edition. These
include the decision given by the Federal
Court of Australia in November 2000 in
NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd
[2000] FCA 1558.
Some kind of concluding chapter on ‘possible
directions and emerging developments’ might have rounded off the work, but
many of those aspects are quite adequately indicated in the relevant chapters.
It may well be that our (very busy and productive)
author will have the
opportunity to add something along those lines to the second edition. The
book’s production is in the
familiar format of Butterworth’s legal
textbooks series, and its notably high standard is a credit to the publisher.
The author, Dal Pont, teaches in the Faculty of Law in the University of
Tasmania at Hobart. In 1996, his book,
Lawyers’ Professional
Responsibility in Australia and New Zealand,
performed a similar and very
welcome service for Antipodean lawyers and legal scholars to that of the present
book. That book amounted
to the first truly comprehensive, very well organised
and thematic treatment of its subject, containing a wealth of references to
relevant and up-to-date case law, statutory materials and legal professional
bodies’ guidelines. It can be expected that this
new book on the
in Australia will be equally well received, and likewise, referred to
often by judges and much consulted by practitioners.
Speaking at the recent launch of the
Oxford University Companion to the
High Court of Australia,
a project celebrating both that Court’s
upcoming centenary 1903– 2002 and also, incidentally, the centenary of
Australia’s
Federation in 1901, Chief Justice of Australia, Hon Murray
Gleeson AC noted the pressing need in Australia, as elsewhere, for much
‘bridge-building’ between legal practice and the academic study of
law. These two fields are not strictly exclusive
and autonomous, despite what
some, upon each side of that particular divide, would have us all believe.
Weisbrot reminded us in his
Australian Lawyers
(1990) p 123 of Max
Weber’s wry observation, as early as 1905, on the tendency of some forms
of law teaching in modern times
towards the ‘emancipation
legal thinking from the everyday needs of the public’. That was then, and
still is, a very curious and, indeed, disturbing
development.
It is sound, well informed and well rounded legal scholarship like that found
in the present work which will make permanent and positive
contributions to the
rule of law in civil society and to the public good. Dal Pont has proved himself
an excellent bridge-builder,
using durable materials and a solid structural
sense to give us a legal work over which the needful traffic of ordinary
activities can be safely guided. It is not usual to comment on book
dedications. However, in this case it seems to me that the manner
and occasion
thereof illustrates something of the author’s solid grounding in the
realities of justice and of community, which
appears to inform and balance his
discussion on the law of agency. Like Sir Isaac Isaacs (a great Australian
expositor of principles
in equity), Dal Pont has reflected there a heartfelt
filial piety for his late mother:
Sapeva poco della lege, ma conosceva delle
cose piu importanti
(she knew little of the law, but she knew about the most
important things). This is a welcome and eminently useful addition to the
bookshelf of the commercial lawyer.
