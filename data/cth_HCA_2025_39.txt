GAGELER CJ,
GORDON, EDELMAN, STEWARD, GLEESON, JAGOT AND BEECH-JONES JJ. These
proceedings concern whether a Commonwealth law is
effective in removing
retroactively an inconsistency between a Commonwealth law and a State law so as
to render the past exaction
of a State land tax valid. If effective, there is a
further question of whether such a Commonwealth law effects an acquisition of
property within the meaning of
Constitution
because it extinguishes the right of a taxpayer to recover payment of the
otherwise invalid State land tax.
into this Court are appeals to the Supreme Court of Queensland by two companies
that own land in Queensland ("the Global
Proceedings"), G Global 120E T2
Pty Ltd and G Global 180Q Pty Ltd ("the GG Entities"). The
GG Entities are owned and controlled by
a company incorporated in Germany.
They appeal against assessments of land tax made under the
Land Tax Act
(Qld) ("the QLTA") for the 2020‑2021 and 2021‑2022
financial years. Additionally, in proceedings commenced in the original
Stott, a citizen of New Zealand, seeks various forms
of relief relating to
assessments of land tax under the
Land Tax Act 2005
(Vic) ("the
VLTA") for the 2016 to 2024 tax years.
assessments each included additional amounts of land tax that either the
GG Entities had to pay because a foreign entity held
a controlling interest
in them or Mr Stott had to pay because he was not an Australian citizen or
resident and present in Australia
at the relevant times. The imposition of the
additional land tax on the GG Entities was contrary to the provisions of an
between Australia and Germany ("the German
Agreement").
The imposition
of the additional land tax on Mr Stott was contrary to the provisions of an
agreement between Australia and New Zealand
("the New Zealand
Convention").
to 8 April 2024, the German Agreement and the New Zealand Convention were
given force of law in full
in Australia by
International Tax Agreements Act
(Cth) ("the ITAA"). As a consequence, prior to 8 April 2024,
the provisions of the QLTA and the VLTA imposing the additional land
inoperative in their application to the GG Entities and Mr Stott by
reason of their inconsistency with
of the ITAA and the operation of
Constitution
8 April 2024, the ITAA was amended by the
Treasury Laws Amendment
(Foreign Investment) Act 2024
(Cth) ("the
Amending Act
") relevantly to
exclude State taxes, including land taxes, that were payable from 1 January
2018 from the scope of s 5(1) of the
ITAA. Thereafter, each of the QLTA and
the VLTA was amended to include provisions the broad effect of which is that, if
the provisions
that imposed the obligation to pay additional land tax remained
inoperative by reason of
Constitution
additional land tax was imposed in the same amounts and on the same terms as had
been purported to be imposed before the
amendments.
other parties to and the interveners in the Global Proceedings and the Stott
Proceedings contended that the amendment to s 5(1)
of the ITAA, either in
its own right or when taken with those amendments to the QLTA and the VLTA,
removed the GG Entities' and Mr
Stott's rights to recover so much of
the additional land tax that was payable (and paid) after 1 January 2018 or
created an offset
that rendered those rights valueless.
to leave granted by Jagot J, the parties agreed to state questions of law
in each proceeding in the form of a special case
for the opinion of the Full
Three principal
issues emerged, the resolution of which is determinative of the questions raised
by the special cases.
first issue, which only arises in the Global Proceedings, is whether the

external affairs power). The answer is that the
Amending Act
and s 5(1) of
the ITAA as amended by the
Amending Act
are both supported by
s 51(xxix).
second issue is whether, having regard to the decision of this Court in
University of Wollongong v
the amendments
made to the ITAA by the
Amending Act
have retroactive effect to remove the
inconsistency that existed prior to 8 April 2024 between s 5(1) of the
ITAA and the provisions
of the QLTA and VLTA that imposed the obligation on the
GG Entities and Mr Stott to pay additional land tax on or after
2018. For the reasons that follow,
reopened and overruled and the
Amending Act
had that retroactive effect.
third issue is whether, having regard to the effect of the amendments made by
Amending Act
on the GG Entities' and Mr Stott's rights to recover
the additional land tax that was payable and paid on or after 1 January
Amending Act
is a law with respect to the acquisition of property
within the meaning of
Constitution
and therefore
invalid as just terms were not provided for the acquisition. For the reasons
that follow, it was not a law with respect
to the acquisition of property.

Article 2 of the Agreements described the taxes covered by them which, in
the case of Australia,
corresponds with the definition of "Australian tax" in
s 3(1) of the ITAA, which relevantly included income tax and fringe
of the German Agreement relevantly provided:

more burdensome

Amending Act
8 April 2024, s 5 of the ITAA was amended by the
Amending Act
Sch 1, inserted s 5(3) as follows:
"The operation of a provision of an agreement provided for by
subsection (1) is subject to anything inconsistent with the provision
contained in a law of the Commonwealth, or of a State or Territory, that imposes
a tax other than Australian tax, unless expressly
provided otherwise in that
as s 5(1) gave force of law to Art 24 of the Agreements, the effect of
s 5(3) is to confine that Article's operation to Australian
tax as defined
in s 3(1) of the ITAA and to exclude the operation of those agreements upon
other taxes imposed by the Commonwealth
as well State and Territory taxes
(unless the relevant law otherwise provides).
only other substantive provision of the
Amending Act
was cl 2 of
Sch 1, which addressed the temporal application of the amendment to
s 5 of the ITAA by the inclusion of s 5(3). Clause
Sch 1 provided as follows:
"The amendment made by this Schedule applies in relation to:
(a) taxes (other than Australian tax) payable on or after 1 January 2018;
(b) taxes (other than Australian tax) payable in relation to tax periods
(however described) that end on or after 1 January 2018."

GG Entities was incorporated in Australia, was the trustee of a unit trust
and at the relevant times was, in its respective
capacity as trustee, an "owner"

GG Entities and the units
in those trusts were ultimately owned or
controlled by DWS. As a consequence, both of the GG Entities were "foreign

the meaning of the

a "foreign trust".
February 2021, the GG Entities were issued with land tax assessments made
Taxation Administration Act 2001
(Qld) ("the
TAA (Qld)") for the 2020-2021 financial year that comprised land tax levied
at the general rate and additional land tax
levied at the Foreign Surcharge

2021‑2022 financial
year. The GG Entities paid those assessments,
which included additional land tax levied at the Foreign Surcharge Rate ("the
additional land tax").
of the TAA (Qld), the GG Entities objected to the
assessments on the basis that in their application to the GG Entities the
of the Queensland laws pursuant to which they were made were
inconsistent with the ITAA. The respondent to the Global Proceedings,
Commissioner for State Revenue of Queensland ("the Qld Commissioner"),
disallowed the objections. Pursuant to
TAA (Qld), the GG Entities appealed to the Supreme Court of Queensland
against the Qld Commissioner's decisions.

Further imposition of land tax
28 February 2025, the QLTA was amended by the inclusion of s 104,
which relevantly provided:

(a) land tax was purportedly imposed for a financial year on taxable land at
the rate (the

section 32(1)(b)(ii) as in force when the liability for the land tax arose;
(b) the land tax was purportedly payable on or after 30 June 2019 and
before 8 April 2024; and
(c) the purported imposition of land tax on the taxable land at the surcharge
rate was invalid only because the provisions of this
Act that purportedly
imposed the land tax were to any extent invalid or inoperative under the

The Stott Proceedings
midnight on 31 December in the year preceding each of the 2016 to 2024 tax
years, Mr Stott was an "absentee person" within the
meaning of s 3(1)
of the VLTA because he was not an Australian citizen or resident, did not
ordinarily reside in Australia and was
absent from Australia on 31 December in
the years between 2015 and 2023, inclusive. As Mr Stott was also an "owner"
of land, he was
at the relevant times an "absentee owner" of land for the
purposes of the VLTA.
Section 104B of the VLTA obliged a person who was an absentee owner on
31 December of each preceding year to lodge a written notice
and associated
documents with the Commissioner for State Revenue ("the
Victorian Commissioner") before 15 January of the following

status as an absentee owner. In February 2017, the Victorian
Commissioner
reassessed Mr Stott's liability to pay land tax for the 2016 and 2017 tax
years by applying the applicable rate for
an absentee owner. Thereafter, the
Victorian Commissioner made assessments for each subsequent tax year up to and
including the 2024
tax year. Mr Stott paid the assessments for the 2016 and
2017 tax years prior to 1 January 2018 and the remainder thereafter ("the
LTS Payments").
February 2024, Mr Stott and another person commenced representative proceedings
in the Federal Court seeking, in the case of Mr
Stott, restitution of the
LTS Payments.

it is necessary
to explain briefly why that answer is correct.
Section 109
Constitution
provides that "[w]hen a law of a State is
inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the
former shall,
to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid". The provision is
only engaged by a law within Commonwealth legislative power and
an otherwise
valid law of the State.
Where there is an inconsistency, the provision resolves the inconsistency by
affording paramountcy to the Commonwealth law and rendering
the State law
"invalid" to the extent of the
inconsistency.

does not render the State law void or
beyond State legislative power but instead renders the State law "inoperative".
On and from
the Commonwealth law ceasing to have effect, the State law resumes
its full force and
authorities in this Court describe two approaches that might be taken to
determining whether an inconsistency within the meaning
although they
should be seen as different aspects of the single concept of
inconsistency.
first approach is often referred to as "direct inconsistency" and involves
considering whether a State law would alter, impair
or detract from the
operation of the Commonwealth
The second approach
is usually referred to as "indirect inconsistency" and involves considering
"whether a law of the Commonwealth
is to be read as expressing an intention to
say 'completely, exhaustively, or exclusively, what shall be the law governing
the particular
conduct or matter to which its attention is
directed'".
A law of that
kind is often described as "'cover[ing] the field'" which it occupies or
"'cover[ing] the subject
with which it
deals such that there is no scope for the operation of a State law dealing with
the same subject
of those approaches might be considered to provide the better explanation, an
inconsistency has never been doubted to exist
between a Commonwealth law which
operates expressly to exclude the operation of a specified category of State law
and a State law
within the category
Thus, there
was clearly an inconsistency between Art 24 of the Agreements as given the
force of law by s 5(1) of the ITAA and the
higher rates imposed by the two
land tax regimes on enterprises owned or controlled by residents of Germany and
on nationals of New
Zealand. As noted, by reason of their ownership and control
by DWS, the GG Entities are "[e]nterprises of a Contracting State" that
wholly owned and controlled by a resident of Germany for the purposes of
Art 24(4) of the German Agreement. The QLTA subjected
those enterprises to
taxation that was more burdensome than the taxation to which the QLTA subjected
similar Australian enterprises,
being those that were not "a foreign company or
a trustee of a foreign trust" under the QLTA, in similar circumstances. The
of the VLTA was that, as a national of New Zealand, Mr Stott was
subject to taxation more burdensome than the taxation to which Australian
nationals were subject in otherwise the same circumstances. Further, in being
obliged to lodge a notice and associated documents
concerning his status as an
absentee owner, Mr Stott was subjected by the VLTA to a more burdensome
requirement connected to taxation
than those requirements connected to taxation
of Australian nationals in otherwise the same circumstances.
Question 1 in both special cases concerns a circumstance that is an
exemplar of the application of s 109, namely a Commonwealth
law conferring
an immunity and State laws infringing
However the
inconsistency is characterised, the relevant State laws impaired or detracted
from the operation of the Commonwealth
in both cases should be answered "yes".
External affairs power
(Question 2 in the Global Proceedings)
in the Global Proceedings is whether "s 5(3) of the [ITAA] (alternatively,
cl 1 of Sch 1 to the [Amending Act]), insofar
as it operates by
reference to a provision contained in a law of a State, [is] supported by any
head of Commonwealth legislative
of the provisions of the international agreements given the force of law by
s 5(1) of the ITAA concern taxes and associated
obligations imposed by laws
of the Commonwealth. To that extent, s 5(1) is a law with respect of
taxation within the meaning of
Constitution
However, to the extent that s 5(1) of the ITAA gives the force of law to a
provision of an international tax agreement that operates
upon taxes imposed by
a law of a State, it is not supported by
Constitution
, it being accepted that the subject matter of
does not include State
of the German Agreement in its application to taxes imposed by the QLTA is such
a provision.
Nevertheless,
in giving effect to obligations imposed by agreements or treaties between the
Executive and foreign countries, including
Art 24 of the German Agreement,
s 5(1) of the ITAA is also a law with respect to external affairs within
the meaning of
Constitution
. The external affairs
power empowers the Commonwealth Parliament to enact laws that are reasonably
capable of being considered appropriate
and adapted to implementing a treaty
prescribing a regime affecting a domestic subject matter such as
GG Entities contend that, by limiting the operation of s 5(1) in
implementing agreements such as the German Agreement, s 5(3)
of the ITAA is
not reasonably capable of being considered as appropriate and adapted to the
implementation of such agreements, and
thus is not a law with respect to
external affairs and is invalid insofar as it operates by reference to a law of
a State. They contend
that s 5(3) contradicts the intended operation of the
German Agreement and impermissibly leaves the degree of implementation of its
provisions to depend on the terms of other Commonwealth, State or Territory laws
as enacted from time to time.
GG Entities seek to draw support for these contentions from the following
observations of Brennan J in
"When the Commonwealth Parliament, in performance of an international treaty
obligation, introduces the provisions of an international
convention into
Australian municipal law, it is beyond the limits of the power conferred by
Constitution
for the Commonwealth Parliament to enact a law that
operates, or that permits a State law to operate, in a manner inconsistent to
any substantial extent with the operation which international law intends the
Convention provisions to have."

principle it describes provided by Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and
Victoria v Commonwealth

that, while a law under s 51(xxix) may partly carry a treaty into effect

unperformed,

treaty is "extremely unlikely" to be characterised
as a law with respect to
external affairs.
Honours articulated the relevant principle as
"Deficiency in implementation of a supporting Convention is not necessarily
fatal to the validity of a law; but a law will be held
invalid if the deficiency
is so substantial as to deny the law the character of a measure implementing the
Convention or it is a
deficiency which, when coupled with other provisions of
the law, make it substantially inconsistent with the Convention."
application of this principle does not involve a simple comparison of particular
provisions of the impugned Commonwealth law
against a particular provision of a
treaty and the invalidation of so much of the former that does not fully
implement the latter.
Instead, it involves determining whether, overall, the
Commonwealth law's implementation of the treaty was so deficient as to preclude
the law being characterised as a measure implementing the relevant treaty and
thus a law with respect to external affairs.
example of the application of this principle is
R v Burgess; Ex parte
the "basal principle" of air navigation regulations was held to contain "so
important a departure from the requirements" of
an international convention for
the regulation of aerial navigation as to be incapable of being supported by an

The Tasmanian Dam Case

difficulty with the GG Entities' attempt to apply the above principle from the
Industrial Relations Act Case
to the present case is that they only seek
to invalidate s 5(3) while preserving s 5(1) in its unamended form.
However, the principle
Industrial Relations Act Case
be applied to s 5(3) in isolation but instead to s 5(1) as amended by
or operating with s 5(3). This is so because, as
a general proposition, the
power to make laws includes the power to unmake or repeal
such that a law
that repeals (or limits the operation of) a valid law is usually supported by
the head of power that supported the
law so repealed (or limited) unless there
is some constitutional limitation on the power to effect the repeal (or
limitation).
unamended form, s 5(1) is supported by s 51(xxix) and no relevant
constitutional limitation is said to be engaged by its repeal
or limitation in
scope, save for s 51(xxxi), which is addressed below. It follows that the
Commonwealth Parliament has the authority
to pass a law repealing or limiting
s 5(1). Where the latter course is taken, the provision as amended must
then be examined to determine
if it is (still) supported by s 51(xxix). If
it is not then, subject to discerning any intention to preserve its unamended
if its amended form is found to be invalid, the whole provision must
be struck down.
effect of s 5(3) of the ITAA is to limit the scope of s 5(1) in its
implementation of the various international agreements, including
Agreement, to Australian tax and, relevantly, to exclude State taxes from the
application of those agreements. This does
not amount to a relevant form of
"inconsistency" between s 5(1) and (3), on the one hand, and the German
Agreement, on the other,
of the kind contemplated by the
Industrial Relations
. The substantive provisions of that agreement, including
Art 24, can be applied even if their scope is limited to Australian tax.
Section 5(1) continues to incorporate into domestic law the core operation of
the specified agreements, including the German Agreement,
with respect to
Australian tax. In that respect there is a partial implementation of the German
Agreement. Section 5(3) simply reduces
the ambit of the implementation of
Art 24 of the German Agreement as a matter of domestic law. Despite that
reduced ambit, s 5 of
the ITAA remains reasonably capable of being
considered appropriate and adapted to implementing the German Agreement. Put
way, there is no deficiency in the implementation of the German
Agreement that is so substantial as to deny s 5(1) the character
measure implementing that agreement.
to the GG Entities' submissions, no analogy may be drawn to the facts of
, where the relevant regulations were made "upon the wrong
assumption that the Commonwealth Parliament has full power to legislate
respect to air navigation" and made provision with respect to matters that had
no foundation in the

Question 2 in the Global Proceedings should be answered "yes".
Revival of inoperative taxes and

Proceedings)
questions reduce to whether s 5(3) of the ITAA and cl 1 of Sch 1
(when read with cl 2 of Sch 1) to the
Amending Act
are effective to
revive the operation of those provisions of the QLTA that purportedly imposed
the Global additional land tax on
the GG Entities (without regard to
s 104 of the QLTA) and those provisions of the VLTA that purportedly
imposed the obligation to
pay the post‑2018 LTS Payments on Mr Stott

first, to construe the relevant provisions to determine whether they
have that operation; if so, to identify whether that operation
is precluded by

The parties'
submissions
Stott contended that Question 2 in the Stott Proceedings should not be
addressed before Question 3 in those proceedings, which
asks whether
s 5(3) is invalid in its application to him in relation to the
post‑2018 LTS Payments on the basis that it is
a law with respect to the
acquisition of property within the meaning of
Constitution
and just terms were not provided for the acquisition. He
contended that Question 2 is addressed to the operation of

Thus Mr Stott
submitted that Question 2 does not arise but, if it is reached, the effect

undo the inconsistency that previously existed, and
be reopened or overruled. The GG Entities' submissions in the Global
Proceedings were not relevantly different.

is that s 5(3) cannot operate
to revive taxes imposed by laws passed prior to 8 April

respect, s 5(3) simply
"clear[s] the way" by prospectively removing the inconsistency that previously
arose so as to allow State
laws to be enacted free from any inconsistency with
Commonwealth law.
Victoria submitted that s 106A of the VLTA is such a provision and the
questions in the special case should be answered by reference
to the operation

reference to the operation and effect

is not necessary to resolve the dispute about whether Question 2 or
Question 3 in the Stott Proceedings should be addressed first.
The analysis
below of whether s 5(3) of the ITAA in its retroactive effect is a law with
respect to the acquisition of property addresses
all of the permutations by
which that issue may arise.
Construction of s 5(3)
parties' submissions raised an issue of construction concerning the temporal
operation of s 5(1) as amended by s 5(3). In particular,
cl 2 of Sch 1 give s 5(3) a "retroactive" operation in respect of
the taxes referred to in cl 2 of Sch 1; ie, does it "operate[]
backwards" to "change[] the law from what it was" by reviving the provisions
that imposed an obligation on the GG Entities to pay
the Global additional
land tax and on Mr Stott to make the post‑2018 LTS Payments from the
time at which they were purportedly
An alternative
construction is that cl 2 of Sch 1 only gives s 5(3) a
"retrospective" effect
the sense that it authorises a law enacted after 8 April 2024 to impose new
taxes (other than Australian tax), payable on or after
1 January 2018 or
applying to tax periods ending on or after 1 January 2018, free of
s 5(1) and the agreements to which it gives

Stephens v The Queen
with the caveat that it should not distract "from

that presumption is greater the more fundamental the rights and the greater the
extent to which they would be infringed
by a retrospective or retroactive
Moreover, there are
degrees of retroactivity.
While the terminology "retroactive" and "retrospective" will be adopted, the
ultimate question is not whether a statute is to be
labelled "retroactive" or
"retrospective", but what is the statute's temporal operation in a particular
retroactive construction is more consonant with the text of s 5(3) and
cl 2 of Sch 1, construed in context and in light of its
purpose. As
already noted, s 5(3) operates to limit the scope of s 5(1) so that it
does not apply to anything inconsistent with "a
law" of the Commonwealth, State
or Territory "that imposes a tax" (other than Australian tax). Clause 2 of
Sch 1 provides for s 5(3)
to apply to various "taxes payable". As
s 5(3) only operates on a law imposing a tax, it follows that cl 2 of
Sch 1 makes s 5(3)
applicable to
imposing taxes "payable
on or after 1 January 2018" or "payable in relation to tax periods (however
described) that end on or after
1 January 2018". While such laws could be
confined to laws that are only enacted after 8 April 2024, it is difficult
to envisage
why they would have been intended to be so limited given that
s 5(3) also expressly applies to laws of the Commonwealth that impose
other than Australian tax. It is inherently unlikely that the Commonwealth
Parliament only intended to make those taxes payable
if it later enacted a
further law reimposing a tax that it already imposed. Analysed in this way, the
text of s 5(3) and cl 2 of
Sch 1 displaces the presumption
against the form of retroactive operation of this statute described
intended retroactive application of s 5(3) in the circumstances specified
in cl 2 of Sch 1 is confirmed by resort to the Explanatory
Amending Act
Explanatory Memorandum referred to the "retrospective nature of [s 5(3)]
provid[ing] certainty for affected taxpayers by preserving
the status quo that
[the] taxes [referred to in cl 2]
have been validly imposed and
Explanatory Memorandum added that the selection of the starting period in
cl 2 of Sch 1 "broadly aligns with the six‑year
limitation periods generally provided under state and territory
legislation".
the Explanatory Memorandum describes s 5(3) as having a "retrospective"
operation, it describes the provision operating
retroactively in the sense that
has been explained above. If the provision only purported to partially disapply
s 5(1) so as to authorise
the imposition of taxes described in cl 2 of
Sch 1 by a further law enacted on or after 8 April 2024, s 5(3)
would not of itself
operate to preserve the valid operation of laws pursuant to
which taxes had already been imposed and collected before 8 April 2024.
The effect of
follows that s 5(3) purports to restrict retroactively the scope of
s 5(1) in its application to laws imposing taxes (other than
tax) as described in cl 2 of Sch 1, including laws enacted prior to
8 April 2024. Does that provision revive so much of
the QLTA that imposed
on the GG Entities the obligation to pay the Global additional land tax and
so much of the VLTA that imposed
the obligation on Mr Stott to make the
post‑2018 LTS Payments?

would ensue if, instead of merely expressing a retroactive legislative

follows that the Commonwealth's contention that
reopened and overruled should be addressed.
Commonwealth's submission that
should be reopened and overruled
was framed by reference to each of the four factors identified in
Federal Commissioner of
considerations relevant to an assessment of whether this Court should reopen or
depart from its earlier decisions; namely whether:
(1) the earlier decision did
not rest upon a principle carefully worked out in a succession of cases; (2)
there was a difference
in the reasoning between the reasons of the justices
comprising the majority; (3) the decision had achieved no useful result; and
the decision had not been independently acted upon in a manner that militates
against its reconsideration. The submission recognised
that those factors are
not necessarily exhaustive or apposite to every application made to this Court
for it to revisit one of its
earlier decisions. Implicit in the first two
factors is also the force of the reasoning that supports the principle upon
decision rests.
far as the first two factors are concerned, in

attempt to retroactively change the Commonwealth law (or its effect) upon which
s 109 operated is ineffective. Their Honours

objective "constitutional fact" which the Court must determine and which forms

violated by a law that purports retroactively to remove an inconsistency,

the strictly linear temporal approach to s 109 of Gibbs CJ, Brennan
and Deane JJ. His Honour accepted that "[s]
109 does not apply only to
laws which are on the statute book at the same time" but also applies to an
inconsistency between a State
law and a retroactive Commonwealth law because
"[o]therwise Parliament's power to legislate retrospectively would be
ineffective"
if Commonwealth laws did not prevail over otherwise inconsistent
State laws.
while his Honour accepted that the Commonwealth Parliament could enact
retroactive laws upon which s 109 would operate to invalidate
State laws as
in force prior to the Commonwealth enactment, his Honour did not accept that
retroactive laws passed by the Commonwealth
Parliament could engage s 109
to remove a past
inconsistency.
Commonwealth Parliament could do one and not the other is not clear.
Wilson and Dawson JJ did not refer to any purpose of s 109 beyond
ensuring the paramountcy of Commonwealth laws over State
Their temporal
approach to s 109 was to apply its terms at the time the inquiry is being
made about its application. Thus, Dawson
"When it is sought to apply s 109, then
at that time the question must
be asked whether there is any inconsistency
between the relevant State law
and the relevant Commonwealth law. If there is, then under s 109 the State
law is inoperative to the
extent of the inconsistency. If there is not, then
s 109 has no operation and it matters not in my view how the absence of an
inconsistency
comes about – whether it be because the Commonwealth has
passed no law on the relevant subject, or because the Commonwealth
has repealed
any law which it had on that subject, or because the Commonwealth law has ceased
to be in force because of the disappearance
of the power (eg, the defence power)
to support it. And if the Commonwealth can remove an inconsistency by repealing
the law there
is no reason, in my view, why it cannot do so retrospectively."
(emphasis added)
rationale for s 109, as giving effect to the citizen's entitlement to know
which of two inconsistent laws he or she is
required to observe, has been taken
up in subsequent cases but not in the context of considering retroactive
Whether or not
that is truly a rationale for s 109 or merely a consequence or effect of
the usual application of s 109 in a context
that does not involve
retroactive laws,
Dawson J's explanation of the temporal operation of s 109 is also
consistent with that rationale if it is to be understood as only
referring to a
citizen making an inquiry about what law was operative at a particular point in
time. If the rationale is not to be
so understood then, contrary to the
statements of the majority in
, s 109 would represent a
significant limitation on the Commonwealth Parliament's capacity to enact
effective retroactive laws.

Native Title Act
Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ
"Section 5(1) [of the
Land (Titles and Traditional Usage) Act
(WA) ("the WA Act")] is concerned to confirm the validity of
grants of title made after the [RDA] came into operation where those
purported to extinguish or impair native title. If native title was protected
then by the [RDA], only a law of the Commonwealth
could be effective to modify
the operation of the [RDA] and then only for the future: the effect of

cannot be retrospectively undone".
Native Title Act Case
addressed the validity and operation of the
Native Title Act 1993
(Cth) ("the NTA"). Section 5(1) of the
WA Act purported to confirm the retrospective extinguishment of native
title to land the subject
of Crown grants in Western Australia and provide
certain statutory rights in place of native
The NTA was
assented to after the WA Act. The NTA recognised and protected native
title, confirmed the validity of (certain) "past
acts", which might otherwise
not have been effective to extinguish or impair native title, and gave full
force and effect to certain
"future acts" which might not otherwise have been
effective to extinguish native
The context for
the above passage is that Western Australia contended that, notwithstanding the
RDA, the WA Act validly extinguished
native title prior to the NTA coming
into force so that there was nothing for the NTA to recognise and
above quote from the
Native Title Act
was obiter dicta in that the
NTA did not purport retroactively to undo the effect of the RDA on inconsistent
provisions of State
legislation that extinguished or impaired native title.
Instead, the NTA prospectively removed any invalidating inconsistency between
State law that might be enacted after the passage of the NTA and purported to
validate certain past acts, on the one hand, and
the RDA or any other law of the
Commonwealth, on the

Limits on Commonwealth
legislative power to enact retroactive legislation
approach of the minority in
to the temporal application of
Constitution
to Commonwealth laws with retroactive or
retrospective effect as explained in the passage from the judgment of
Dawson J set out above
should be accepted. Two particular aspects of that
approach should be noted.
as noted, it was accepted in the
Credit Tribunal Case
and by the minority
that an expressed legislative intention that a Commonwealth
law is not intended to make exclusive provision on a particular subject
is not effective to avoid a direct inconsistency between the Commonwealth law
and a State law in the form of a direct collision
between laws making it
impossible to obey the commands of

apply to such a legislative intention expressed to operate retroactively. These
propositions do not, however, reflect

power arising from
but instead illustrate the force of the statement
Work Health Authority v Outback Ballooning Pty Ltd
that the "question
whether a State or Territory law is inconsistent with a Commonwealth law is to
be determined as a matter of
construction".
there to be such a direct collision between an obligation imposed by a
Commonwealth law and an obligation imposed by a State
law, then an express
statement of intention in the Commonwealth law that it was not intended to make
exclusive provision on a particular
subject matter, or that it was not intended
to affect the operation of the relevant provision of the State law, without
more, would
be ineffective to remove that inconsistency unless that statement,
as a matter of construction, qualifies the substantive operation

"intention" in this context are to be understood
as an aspect of the process of
statutory construction of the provisions of the relevant legislation as a whole;
express legislative
statements of the intention of a statutory provision are an
important factor in that process but they are not necessarily
determinative.
explained, here there was what could be characterised as a direct inconsistency
between the Commonwealth law, namely s 5(1) of
the ITAA insofar as it gave
force of law to Art 24 of the German Agreement and of the New Zealand
Convention, and State laws, namely
the relevant provisions of the QLTA and the
Amending Act

that there was no inconsistency. Instead, it removed with retroactive effect

as suggested by the above discussion of the
Native Title Act
Commonwealth does not have unlimited authority to enact laws that engage
, nor unlimited authority to enact retroactive laws. A Commonwealth
law, including, and perhaps especially, a law that has retroactive

legislative power because it infringes an express
or implied constitutional
prohibition such as would be engaged were the law to significantly impair,

of the States to exercise their constitutional

Conclusion on
Amending Act
having been reopened and overruled, it follows that s 5(3) of the ITAA,
when read with cl 2 of Sch 1 to the
Amending Act
, was effective to
remove the inconsistency that previously existed between the provision of the
QLTA that imposed land tax at the
Foreign Surcharge Rate and s 5(1) of the
ITAA in respect of the taxes referred to in cl 2 of Sch 1.
Question 3 in the Global Proceedings
should be answered "yes".
s 5(3) and cl 2 of Sch 1 are also valid and effective to remove
the equivalent inconsistency identified in Question 1
in relation to the
provisions that imposed an obligation on Mr Stott to make the
post‑2018 LTS Payments. Question 2 in the
Stott Proceedings should
also be answered "yes".
Acquisition of property (Question 4
in the Global Proceedings and Question 3 in the Stott Proceedings)
essence, Question 4 in the Global Proceedings asks whether s 5(3) of
the ITAA, when read with cl 2 of Sch 1 to the
Amending Act
, is invalid
in whole or in part because, in its application to the GG Entities' rights
of recovery of the Global additional land
tax, it is a law with respect to an
acquisition of property within the meaning of s 51(xxxi) without the
provision of just terms.
Question 3 in the Stott Proceedings is to the same
effect save that it concerns the plaintiff's rights of recovery of the
LTS Payments.
follows from the answer to Question 3 in the Global Proceedings, and
Question 2 in the Stott Proceedings, that these questions
addressed on the basis of the retroactive effect of s 5(3) and cl 2 of
Sch 1; ie, that those provisions operate to revive
the provisions of the
QLTA and the VLTA that imposed the obligation on the GG Entities to pay the
Global additional land tax and
the obligation on Mr Stott to make the
post‑2018 LTS Payments respectively.
Stott submitted that, as choses of action are a form of
"property",
restitutionary claim to recover the post‑2018 LTS Payments is property for
the purposes of s 51(xxxi). He contended that
the retroactive operation of
s 5(3) either extinguishes, sufficiently impairs, or "leach[es] the
economic value of"
restitutionary claims and results in a direct benefit or gain to the State of
Victoria so as to give s 5(3) in its retroactive
operation a prima facie
acquisitive character. Based on the extrinsic materials referable to the passage
Amending Act
he contended that the purpose of s 5(3) having retroactive effect was to
effect an extinguishment of any claim to a refund. He further
submitted that,
unlike a tax imposed by a law supported by
Constitution
, s 5(3) is supported by
abstracts the power to pass laws with respect to the acquisition
of property from that head of
GG Entities' submissions were to the same effect, save that they also contended
that their rights of appeal to the Supreme Court
of Queensland against the
disallowance of their objections constituted "property" for the purposes of
s 51(xxxi).
respondent in each of the Global Proceedings and each defendant in the Stott
Proceedings, as well as some of the interveners,
disputed the characterisation
of s 5(3) as a law with respect to the acquisition of property principally
on the basis that it only
removes an obstacle to a State law validly imposing
taxation. They contended that, while s 5(3) may have removed an element of
restitutionary actions that contended that the Global additional land tax
and Mr Stott's obligation to make the post‑2018 LTS
Payments were
unlawfully imposed, s 5(3) did not directly extinguish those causes of
action. Amongst other matters, it was also contended
that the effect of various
provisions of the VLTA, the QLTA and the
Limitation of Actions Act
(Qld) (in the Global Proceedings) were such that the
GG Entities and Mr Stott did not have any cause of action that could
GG Entities responded by submitting that their rights of recovery were protected

requisite sense were not picked up and applied by
in the representative proceedings commenced in the Federal Court.
is not necessary to address all these points. Instead, Question 4 in the
Global Proceedings and Question 3 in the Stott Proceedings
can be addressed
on the assumption that, absent the retroactive operation of s 5(3), the
GG Entities have sufficiently viable choses
in action for restitution of
the Global additional land tax and Mr Stott has the same in relation to the
post‑2018 LTS Payments
to constitute "property" for the purposes of
, and that those choses in action will in effect be extinguished
if the retroactive operation of s 5(3) is upheld. Nevertheless, as
submitted by both Victoria and the Qld Commissioner, in merely reviving
State laws imposing discriminatory land taxes, s 5(3) is
not a law with
respect to the acquisition of property because State laws imposing taxation do
not effect an acquisition of property.
Genuine taxation is not

read with the opening words of
Constitution
provides that the Commonwealth Parliament shall, subject to the
Constitution
, have power to make laws for the peace, order and good
government of the Commonwealth with respect to the acquisition of property
just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the
Commonwealth Parliament has power to make laws. This
provision has two relevant
effects: one being to confer a legislative power to make particular laws with
respect to the acquisition
of property conditional on the provision of just
terms; and the other being to abstract the power to support a law for the
acquisition
of property at least from the other legislative powers in
of that abstraction is that

any law which has the character of a law with respect to an acquisition of

power to make any law.
Mutual Pools & Staff Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth
nominated, as examples of laws that are not laws with respect to acquisitions of
property, laws supported by
s 51(xxxiii)
which confers legislative power
with respect to the acquisition of State railways "on terms arranged between the
Commonwealth and
the State", laws authorising the exercise of powers with
respect to bankruptcy and insolvency by the sequestration of the property
bankrupt and its vesting in the Official Receiver, laws authorising the
forfeiture of prohibited imports or the forfeiture of
property as a consequence
of a conviction for a criminal offence or breach of a statutory provision and
laws relating to the imposition
one part of his Honour's judgment in
Mutual Pools
described these as instances of the
Constitution
manifesting a contrary
intention to the abstracting effect of
s 51(xxxi).
However, given that
abstracts at least from the other
legislative powers in
instances are best understood as examples of laws vesting powers the exercise of
which does not involve an acquisition of property
within the meaning of
s 51(xxxi).
s 51(xxxiii)
only confers legislative power for the
acquisition of railways from a State, "with the consent of [the relevant]
State". A law giving
effect to such an acquisition would not be a law with
respect to the
(compulsory)
acquisition of property.
present relevance is Mason CJ's observation in
Mutual Pools
laws relating to the imposition of taxation, namely
"because the purpose served by an exercise of the taxation power conferred by
is compulsorily to acquire money for public purposes, a law that
relates to the imposition of taxation
will rarely, if ever
, amount at the
same time to a law with respect to the acquisition of property within the
s 51(xxxi).
Of its nature 'taxation' presupposes the absence of
the kind of quid pro quo involved in the "just terms" prescribed by
s 51(xxxi)."
(emphasis added)
mutual exclusivity between the imposition of taxation and the acquisition of
property was accepted by the other members of the
and is well
established.
possible exception in respect of a law that relates to the imposition of
taxation adverted to by Mason CJ in the above passage
arises from the following passage in
Australian Tape Manufacturers
Association Ltd v The
Commonwealth
"If ... a law did no more than provide that a particular named person was under
an obligation to pay to the Commonwealth an amount
of money equal to the total
value of all his or her property, the law would effect an acquisition of

proposition that the imposition of an obligation to

(emphasis added)
phrase "genuine taxation" in this passage is to be understood in the context of
the clarification in

to a tax being "no more than the imposition of a pecuniary

is not necessary to decide whether all of these features of the "usual
description of a tax" are necessary elements of a "genuine
tax" that cannot
constitute an acquisition of property for the purposes of
s 51(xxxi).
suffices to observe that those provisions of the QLTA which imposed the
additional land tax on the GG Entities and those provisions
of the VLTA
which imposed the additional land tax on Mr Stott, all of which were
revived by the retroactive operation of s 5(3),
satisfy all of these
criteria. On any view, those provisions of the QLTA and the VLTA imposed a
"genuine tax". They did not effect
any direct expropriation of money or other
a Commonwealth law imposing "genuine taxation" is not properly characterised as
a law with respect to the acquisition of property,
it must follow that a
Commonwealth law that revives the operation of a State law imposing genuine
taxation is not properly characterised
as a law with respect to the acquisition
of property. This is so even if the Commonwealth law that revives the operation

follows that, in its retroactive operation upon the GG Entities' rights of
recovery of the Global additional land tax and their
appeals to the Supreme
Court of Queensland, and Mr Stott's rights of recovery of the
post‑2018 LTS Payments, s 5(3) is not
a law with respect to the
acquisition of property. The same result would also follow had it been necessary
to address the suggested
retrospective operation of s 5(3).
Question 4 in the Global Proceedings and Question 3 in the Stott
Proceedings should be answered "no".
Remaining questions
Question 4A
in the Global Proceedings concerns the effect of
of the QLTA and
s 189 of the TAA (Qld) on the appeals to the Supreme Court of
Queensland and Question 4B addresses the validity of
those provisions if
they do require those appeals to be disallowed. Similarly, Question 4 in
the Stott Proceedings concerns the validity
and operation of s 106A of the
VLTA. As those provisions are not engaged, it follows that these questions do
GG Entities seek special costs orders against the Qld Commissioner. First,
they seek orders for indemnity costs up to 8 April
2024 because the
Qld Commissioner conceded that the Global additional land tax was invalidly
imposed until that date. Second, they
seek an order that the
Qld Commissioner pay their costs for the period from 8 April 2024 to
28 February 2025, the latter being the
of the QLTA and
s 189 of the TAA (Qld) commenced. The GG Entities contend that,
to succeed, the Qld Commissioner had to argue successfully
should be overturned but instead after 28 February 2025 the
Qld Commissioner relied on
of the QLTA and s 189 of the
TAA (Qld). That basis for a special costs order is not made out because
has been overturned and
and 189 are not engaged.
Otherwise, it was not demonstrated that any particular costs were thrown away by
the supposedly belated
nature of the concession concerning the inconsistency
that existed prior to 8 April 2024.
