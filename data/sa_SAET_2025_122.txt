outlets. The applicant managed two of those outlets,
both located within the
city premises of the University of South Australia. The applicant’s
remuneration included a salary
plus a profit share bonus, the terms of which
were set out in a written contract of employment.
applicant worked from 1 February 2024 to 29 November 2024. The applicant and AKH
agreed the terms of the bonus, which was set
out in their written contract. The
applicant was entitled to quarterly profit shares, payable within 60 days of the
end of each quarter.
They agreed that the quarters were periods of three months
of employment, calculated from the commencement of employment on 1 February
2024, with a pro rata entitlement for the final quarter. No bonuses were paid,
despite the applicant believing, and asserting, that
her outlets were earning

her contractual entitlement to bonuses, and contraventions

as to how this figure was
calculated.

applicant’s contraventions case was that a number of unrelated or
arbitrary expenses were incorrectly added to each quarters’
that significant revenue was excluded from two quarters.
a hearing on 17 July 2025, I delivered oral reasons for upholding the
applicant’s claims in principle, while granting
AKH an opportunity to seek
to tender further relevant documents on the discrete topic of the dates of
receipt of revenue, and reserving
judgement on the final quantum of owed bonus.
subsequently determined the applicant was entitled to a bonus of $5,180 for her
first quarter, $1,521 for the second quarter, $3,363
for the third quarter, and
a pro rata bonus of $3,250 for the final quarter. The unexplained late payment
to the applicant of $1,780.45
was credited as part payment of the final bonus.
concluded that certain expenses attributed to admin, cleaning supplies,
subscriptions, advertising, consulting, repairs and outgoings,
incorrectly added to the applicant’s sites. I also found that very high
‘production costs’ had been incorrectly
added as expenses, in
addition to the internal costs of goods sold, which was accepted as correct.
example, in July 2024, cost of sales expenses of $9,732 were charged for breads,
dry ingredients and pastries, as well as unexplained
‘production
costs’ of $22,360.
2024, unexplained admin costs of $9,404 were also charged. Mr Wilson sought to
justify charging an expense for the internal
costs of goods sold as well as the
costs of production of those goods. He did not accept this was double counting.
Nor could he explain
how the production and admin costs figures were set.
found that $9,207 of paid catering revenue was excluded from August’s
results, and $36,828 for the same event was excluded

They are to be treated as one contravention for the purpose of imposing a

The common course of conduct was to add the same type of

job to produce a nil result each quarter.

has been no rectification by AHK. Nor has it paid the ordered pre-trail interest
of $800. It has paid nothing to the applicant.
It has not communicated with her.
It has not lodged an appeal, despite Mr Wilson insisting AHK had filed an appeal
in the Federal
Court, which unnecessarily caused this application to be
adjourned twice.
Wilson has not acknowledged the Court’s ruling and his mistakes. There is
no evidence of any changed attitude to the applicant’s
entitlement. There is no evidence of any response regarding how other site
managers’ bonuses are calculated.
written and oral evidence was received from the applicant in this proceeding. I
accept that unchallenged evidence as truthful.
applicant was initially approached by Mr Wilson and offered a position of
managing two retails sites. She was not then seeking
new employment. Mr Wilson
obtained her contact details from a marketing company that knew her. The
applicant was interested but not
at the offered remuneration. The offer was a
salary plus a 5% quarterly profit bonus, with an increase to 10% after two
service. Mr Wilson told her the 5% bonus scheme applied to other
site managers. After more negotiations, the applicant accepted an
offer with a 10% profit share. The written contract reflected the agreed bonus
applicant worked the agreed 40 hours per week plus additional hours.
Wilson was the only officer of the AKH who communicated with her about the
bonus. AKH’s external accountant referred her
bonus queries to Mr Wilson.
The applicant first raised verbal concerns with Mr Wilson in June 2024 about
non-payment of a bonus for
the first quarter. As she felt his response was
evasive, she put her queries in writing.
applicant was sent an email by Mr Wilson on 21 October
that prompted the
applicant’s resignation. Mr Wilson commenced by congratulating her
performance in growing and developing
the sites, and by describing her
“physical and mental work ethic” as “outstanding”. He
then criticised her
attitude and communications with him, with a warning that
termination may result with no improvement. His response regarding no bonus
payment in the first 9 months of employment was: “...your bonus incentive
structure has been and is continually underway for
processing at the earliest
possible time.”
applicant’s evidence is that Mr Wilson also told her she was ungrateful.
applicant was later given revised profit and loss figures. These included higher
expenses that had been introduced or manipulated
to produce losses. The
applicant was also told by Mr Wilson that no catering revenue had been received
during her employment, when
subsequently produced payment records showed the
Assessment of penalty
purpose of imposing a civil penalty is to deter future non-compliance with the
minimum National Employment Standards. A civil
penalty is not punitive or
proportionate. If there is evidence of genuine contrition and thorough
rectification of contraventions
for all affected employees, and evidence of
revised systems to ensure no similar future contraventions, there may be very
need for individual deterrence.
that is not the case here. I conclude there has been a complete absence of any
rectification of the applicant’s entitlements
and of AKH’s bonus
system. There is no evidence of any contrition by either respondent. The
Court’s payment orders have
been ignored, without any communication to the
also find an aggravating circumstance has not been addressed. That is the
production of unjustified revised figures by Mr Wilson
to show losses in each
quarter. Based on this circumstance, together with the unjustified disciplinary
warning, I infer AKH engaged
in unreasonable retaliatory action against the
applicant for pursuing her bonuses.
conclude that the circumstances of the contraventions call for a significant
penalty to be imposed on the employer, and on Mr Wilson
to deter similar
conduct. An element of general deterrence is included for the benefit of
employers and those responsible for objectively
calculated bonuses or
commissions.
regard to all the circumstances, I conclude it is appropriate to impose a
penalty of $30,000 on AKH and a penalty of $15,000
on Mr Wilson. I order the
penalties to be paid to the applicant.
order Abbots and Kinney Holding Pty Ltd to pay a penalty of $30,000 to the
applicant within 21 days.
order Richard Wilson to pay a penalty of $15,000 to the applicant within 21
