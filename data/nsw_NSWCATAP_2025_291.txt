REASONS FOR DECISION
INTRODUCTION
Consumer and Commercial Division of the Tribunal ordered that the appellant pay
$201,463.63 to the respondent for the cost to
rectify defective building
appeal concerned a challenge to:
(1) the cost to rectify what were referred to as “item 8 –
loungeroom flooring (Loungeroom Floor Issue) and “item
13, glazing”
(Glazing Issue), being $75,187.82 of the amount ordered; and
(2) the Tribunal’s order for the payment of money, rather than a work
reasons deal with the question of costs following the Appeal Panel’s
decision given on 5 September 2025 in which we dismissed
the appeal and made
directions for the filing of submissions in respect of the costs of the
PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS AND ISSUE TO BE
respondents filed submissions, and an affidavit of the first respondent dated 19
September 2025, in which they submitted for the
appellant to pay the
respondents’ costs:
(1) on an indemnity basis from the date of rejected offers made on 13 February
2025 for $288,000.00 (first offer) and 5 March 2025
for $285,636.00 (second
(2) calculated on 80% of an indemnity basis; or
(3) on an ordinary basis as agreed or assessed.
respondents submit that their costs ought to be assessed on an indemnity basis
(1) the appellant unreasonably rejected the offers; or
(2) a combination of the appellant achieving a worse outcome than it would have
had if it accepted either offer, the case propounded
by the appellant’s
being very weak with low prospect of success, and the appellant conducting the
appeal in a manner that unreasonably
increased the respondents’ costs.
appellant filed submissions on 3 October 2025 in which it:
(1) accepted that the amount in dispute was more than $30,000.00 and therefore
Civil and Administrative Tribunal Rules
(the NCAT Rules) and therefore Rule 38A apply to the question of costs;
(2) submitted that the Tribunal should order that the appellant pay the
respondents’ costs of the appeal on the ordinary basis
as agreed or
assessed; and
(3) opposed the respondents’ costs being assessed on an indemnity basis.
follows that the issue for consideration is whether, having regard to the first
offer and / or the second offer, or alternatively
the appellant’s conduct
in respect of the appeal, that the respondents’ costs ought to be assessed
on an indemnity basis
from the date of one of the offers or “

WHETHER TO DISPENSE WITH A HEARING
IN RESPECT OF COSTS
Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
2013 (the NCAT ACT)
out the circumstances in which the Tribunal can dispense with a hearing and
proceed to determine a matter, including a costs
application, having regard to
submissions filed with the Tribunal.
Tribunal is satisfied that the parties have been afforded an opportunity to make
submissions on whether a hearing on the question
of costs should be dispensed
with and whether the question of costs can be determined on the papers, and
notes that all parties consented
to the question of costs being determined on
the papers.
considered the submissions filed by the parties, we are satisfied that the
question of costs can be adequately determined in
the absence of the parties by
considering the written submissions and other documents or material lodged with
or provided to the
Appeal Panel.
to Section 50(4) of the NCAT Act, we exercise our discretion to determine the
question of costs on the papers.
PRINCIPLES RELEVANT TO A
CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER INDEMNITY COSTS SHOULD BE ORDERED
relevant to a consideration of whether an indemnity costs orders ought to be
made where “Calderbank” offers
have not been accepted, were set out
in the reasons of the Appeal Panel in
Thompson v Chapman
[2016] NSWCATAP
, where the Appeal Panel, in reliance upon authorities in the NSWCA and
Supreme Court including
Miwa PL v Siantan Properties PL [No 2]
, to which can be added (among other authority)
Hazeldene's Chicken
Farm PL v Victorian Workcover Authority (No 2)
(2005) 13 VR 435,
[2005] VSCA
El-Wasfi v NSW; Kassas v NSW (No 2)
[2018] NSWCA 27
Blacktown CC
[2019] NSWCA 248
and authority there discussed, said at
91 .... The following principles can be derived in respect of
whether a special order for costs should be made:
(1) there must be a real and genuine element of compromise;
(2) the refusal must be unreasonable;
(3) the reasonableness in rejecting an offer must be considered at the time the
offer is made, not with the benefit of hindsight;
(4) relevant factors in relation to whether the rejection was unreasonable
(a) the stage of the proceedings at which the offer was received;
(b) the time allowed to consider the offer;
(c) the extent of the compromise offered;
(d) the offeree’s prospects of success, assessed at the date of the
(e) the clarity with which the terms of the offer were expressed;
(f) whether the offer foreshadowed an application for indemnity costs in the
event of rejection.
triggers the assessment of the offer is what one achieves in the litigation
outcome compared with the terms of the offer. However,
the reasonableness of
conduct in rejecting the offer is assessed at the point in time the offer is
made, on the knowledge the offeree
then has about litigious documentation and
prospects. Circumstances can arise where “it may not be unreasonable to
offer, notwithstanding that the amount of the offer is reasonable and,
in particular, notwithstanding that the offer (in the case
of an offer made by a
defendant) is greater than the damages that are awarded”:

Notice of Appeal and stay application were filed on 24 December 2024.
15 January 2025, the order for the payment of $75,187.82, being the amount
challenged on appeal, was stayed.
13 February 2025, the respondents offered that the appellant pay the respondents
$238,000.00 (which would be in addition to an
amount of $50,000.00 already
paid), such that the offer, in effect, was that the appellant pays the
respondents $288,000.00 inclusive
of costs. The offer also included a table
identifying what the respondents said were its costs payable on an ordinary
basis for the
hearing below. The identified amount was $96,300.00. It also
identified its costs of a stay application of $6,098.00, and post judgment
interest of $8,099.00.
that the total sum ordered to be paid by the Tribunal was $201,463.63, the offer
therefore sought $86,536.37 on account of
its costs below, costs of the stay
application and post judgment interest.
offer was open for acceptance until 14 March 2025.
5 March 2025, the respondents offered that the appellant pay the respondents
$235,645.00 (which would be in addition to an amount
of $50,000.00 already
paid), such that the offer, in effect, was that the appellant pay the
respondents $285,636.00 inclusive of
costs. Mindful that the total sum ordered
to be paid by the Tribunal was $201,463.63, the offer therefore sought
$84,172.37 on account
of its costs below, costs of the stay application and post
judgment interest.
offer was open for acceptance until 14 March 2025.
respondents contend that they have now done better that what was offered and
that it was unreasonable for the appellant not to
have accepted either offer
(1) The respondents had an order in their favour for the payment of $201,463.00
plus costs;
(2) Interest was accruing on the Amount ordered, the respondents say was
$4,104.93 at the time of the 13 February 2025 offer;
(3) The respondents had the benefit of a costs order in the primary proceedings
that the appellant pay the respondents’ costs
on an ordinary basis to 8
February 2024 and thereafter on an indemnity basis;
(4) The respondents claimed costs of $96,300.00 pursuant to that order;
(5) The respondents had a costs order in their favour in respect of a stay
application, in respect of which it claimed $6089.00;
(6) In that light the respondents “maximised position”, which
included the costs it claimed (rather than what had been
agreed or assessed) at
the time of the first offer was $307,956.93 plus the costs of the appeal.
(7) If the appellant had won, other than on grounds 1 or 9, it would have been
based on a case not run below, in which case, the
respondents contend that it is
likely that no costs would have been ordered or possibly costs ordered against
the appellant;
(8) If the appellant had accepted the offer, it would have reduced its liability
to the compromised amount in respect of the Amount
ordered, costs of the hearing
before the Tribunal, interest, and costs of the stay application; and
the following reasons, we are not satisfied that it was unreasonable for the
appellant not to have accepted the offers.
in so far as the appeal was concerned, the offer was seeking for it to be
dismissed and that some compromised amount of the
costs it claimed for the stay
application be paid. Given the offer was made to resolve the amount of
$201,463.00 which was ordered
to be paid, the costs orders below, and interest
accrued since the making of the orders by the primary member, and that the costs
for the hearing below and the stay application have not been agreed or assessed,
it is impossible to determine the amount, if any,
that the offers involved a
compromise of the appeal.
in so far as the offers sought to resolve everything, they included an amount
for the costs of the hearing below and the
stay application that had not yet
been agreed or assessed.
(1) the costs had not been agreed or assessed and there is a dispute as to the
amount the costs are to be discounted to account for
a costs order made below in
favour of the appellant in the proceedings before the Tribunal, and
(2) the amount to be paid inclusive of accrued interest, costs of the hearing
before the Tribunal and the stay application was about
$86,536.37 on the first
offer and $84,172.37 on the second offer;
(3) we do not know the amount by which the costs have been compromised and given
that there is not, in our view, such a significant
difference between the
respondents’ maximum claim for costs for the hearing in the Tribunal,
interest and costs of the stay
application at the time of the offers of about
$110,000.00 and the amounts sought of $86,536,37 on the first offer and
on the second offer, we are not satisfied that it was unreasonable
for the appellant’s not to accept the offer.
OTHER REASONS CONTENDED FOR INDEMNITY COSTS ORDER
respondents alternatively contend that that an indemnity costs order ought to be
made because of:
(1) the applicant being worse off from not having accepted the offers;
(2) the weakness of the appellant’s case on appeal; and
(3) the appellant’s unreasonable conduct on appeal,
considering this further ground for an indemnity costs order, we note
(1) Indemnity costs are only awarded in limited circumstances;
(2) The discretion to do so must be the subject of careful reasoning;
(3) Caution should be exercised in making such an award;
(4) Other circumstances in which an indemnity costs order may be made include:
(a) when a case is commenced or continued where there is no chance of success,
although mere weakness of a case will not be sufficient
to warrant an exercise
of the discretion to award indemnity costs;
(b) where the proceedings amount to an abuse of process;
(c) unreasonable conduct, by a party, including unnecessarily prolonging the
proceedings; and
(d) misconduct of a serious nature.
found that it was not unreasonable (at the time the offers were made) for the
appellant not to have accepted the offers, in
our view, the respondents are not
assisted by contending to the effect that having not accepted the offers and
having now lost the
appeal the appellant is now worse off than if it had
accepted the offer because it will now be liable for the costs of the appeal,
even if only on an ordinary basis.
in our view the additional matters raised by the respondents as to the grounds
of appeal including seeking to withdraw an
admission and set aside a
discretionary work order, are not matters that are sufficient to find that the
appellant had no chance
of success, or that the appeal was an abuse of process,
or involved unreasonable conduct or misconduct of the appellant in the conduct
of the appeal, as referred to in
Mendonca v Tonna
so as to justify
the making of an indemnity costs order.
order that:
(1) Pursuant to
Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013
a hearing in respect of costs is dispensed with.
(2) The appellant is to pay the respondents’ costs of the appeal as agreed
or assessed on the ordinary basis.
I hereby certify that this is a true and accurate record of the reasons for
