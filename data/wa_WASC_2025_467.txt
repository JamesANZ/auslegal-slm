Introduction
& Grieve Engineers Pty Ltd (formerly Wood & Grieve Engineers Limited)
seeks further and better particulars of part of
the pleaded claim of CPB
Contractors Pty Ltd (formerly known as Leighton Contractors Pty Limited). The
request in its final form
is set out in the revised minute of proposed orders
and outline of submissions filed on 4 September 2025. The request
concerns paragraph
75(a)(iv) of the further amended statement of claim
filed on behalf of CPB Contractors dated 22 March 2022.
further amended statement of claim, with appendices, stands at 373 pages.
The re‑amended defence and counterclaim, with
appendices, stands at
368 pages. By way of high level introduction, I note the following (which I
do not understand to be contentious).
or around 1 January 2012 the State of Western Australia established
the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority, which was tasked
to deliver and design
the construction of a public realm and inlet for the purpose of upgrading and
redeveloping the Elizabeth Quay
Site. This redevelopment was referred to as the
Elizabeth Quay Project. On or around 22 May 2012, the State of Western
issued a 'request for proposal' seeking proposals for the design and
construction of the public realm and inlet of the Elizabeth
& Grieve Engineers provides design services to the construction industry
through a consultancy
The State of Western Australia (acting through an agent), engaged Wood &
Grieve Engineers to carry out civil engineering services
for the Elizabeth Quay
agreement by which Wood & Grieve Engineers was engaged was varied and
extended, including through the preparation of a series
of formal documents
referred to as the pre-novation consultancy agreement. With effect from about
19 December 2012, the pre-novation
consultancy agreement was novated from
the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority to CPB Contractors on the same
terms and consisting
of the same documents. This was referred to as the
'Consultancy Agreement'. The services agreed to be provided under the
Consultancy
Agreement included 'Design Development and Contract Documentation'
(as defined in the Consultancy Agreement) and 'Construction Support
(as defined in the Consultancy
Agreement).
broad terms, in this proceeding CPB Contractors makes claims against Wood &
Grieve Engineers for loss and damage arising from
the alleged breach by Wood
& Grieve Engineers of the Consultancy Agreement, or in the alternative
negligence on the part of Wood
& Grieve Engineers in the period from about
1 October 2012 until the completion of the works on the Elizabeth Quay
Project arising
from or in connection with Wood & Grieve Engineers' delays
in providing and/or failures to provide Design Development and Contract
Documentation; provision of inaccurate, inadequate and/or incomplete Design
Development and Contract Documentation; failure to remedy
errors, omissions or
ambiguities contained in the Design Development and Contract Documentation;
failure to comply with directions
from CPB Contractors under the Consultancy
Agreement; failure to consult with, and make reasonable enquiries, of CPB
Contractors
in carrying out the services under the Consultancy Agreement;
failure to provide required notifications to CPB Contractors in connection
the Consultancy Agreement; and/or failure to exercise the standard of care,
skill and diligence required of a consultant in
the position of Wood &
Grieve Engineers in the provision of engineering services to CPB
Contractors.
Contractors further claims from Wood & Grieve Engineers under the
Consultancy Agreement, alternatively as restitution for
money had and received,
repayment of fees alleged to have been overpaid by CPB Contractors to Wood
& Grieve Engineers by mistake
as a result of payment claims made by Wood
& Grieve Engineers between about May 2013 and about February 2015 in breach
of a warranty
given by Wood & Grieve Engineers to CPB Contractors in
the Consultancy Agreement.
summary, by way of counterclaim Wood & Grieve Engineers seeks to recover
various sums from CPB Contractors under the Consultancy
declarations that CPB Contractors acted in breach of the Consultancy
Agreement; that damages be assessed for breach of
the Consultancy Agreement; and
recovery of interest and
Relevant procedural
background to the request for further and better particulars was conveniently
summarised on behalf of CPB Contractors in the
outline of submissions filed
before the hearing of the
application.
The following draws from that summary.
proceeding was commenced by writ on 18 October 2021 and a statement of
claim was filed on 25 October 2021. That pleading included
conventional causation and loss and damages claim (from paragraphs 67 to
74), and an alternative causation and loss and damages
claim, pleaded as a
global and/or modified total costs claim against Wood & Grieve Engineers
(paragraph 75).
14 February 2022 CPB Contractors filed an amended statement of claim. That
pleading again included a conventional causation and
loss and damages claim
(from paragraphs 67 to 74), and an alternative causation and loss and
damages claim pleaded as a global and/or
modified total costs claim against Wood
& Grieve Engineers (paragraph 75, with further particulars at
Appendix L).
22 March 2022 a further amended statement of claim was filed. In the
further amended pleading, paragraph 75 and Appendix L remained
26 August 2022 Wood & Grieve Engineers filed its defence and counterclaim,
which among other things responded to paragraph
75(a)(iv) of the further
amended statement of claim. While the defence and counterclaim was amended on
10 October 2022 and re‑amended
on 21 December 2022,
the defence pleaded to the alternative global and/or modified total costs claim
was not amended.
26 August 2025 (before a directions hearing listed on 27 August 2025),
Wood & Grieve Engineers filed a minute of proposed
orders which included a
request for further and better particulars of paragraph 75(a)(iv) of the
further amended statement of claim.
the course of the directions hearing on 27 August 2025, counsel for
Wood & Grieve Engineers pressed the application for
further and better
particulars of paragraph 75(a)(iv) of the further amended statement of
claim and made oral submissions. With the
limited notice provided, counsel for
CPB Contractors was without instructions and not in a position to address the
application in
the course of the directions
Orders were made programming the application, including an order requiring Wood
& Grieve Engineers to file and serve a revised
minute of proposed
4 September 2025 a revised minute of proposed orders for particulars and an
outline of submissions was filed on behalf of Wood
& Grieve Engineers.
15 September 2025 the solicitors for CPB Constructions wrote to solicitors for
Wood & Grieve Engineers with a proposal to
provide source documents for the
actual costs referred to in the table at paragraph 75(a)(iv) of the further
amended statement of
claim (reproduced below); and each payment from the
Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority or any other entity in respect of the works
the subject of the following SWPs (subwork packages): 7001, 3101, 4001, 4004,
6003, 7002, 4406 (which documents I understand have
been discovered in the
proceeding). Upon conferral, this proposal was not considered sufficient, and
the terms of the revised minute
remained in
19 September 2025 an outline of submissions in response to the application was
filed on behalf of CPB Contractors. An outline
of submissions in reply and a
memorandum of conferral were filed on behalf of Wood & Grieve Engineers on
26 September 2025.
the hearing of the application on 14 October 2025, counsel relied upon
the various outlines filed and were further heard in relation
application.
The pleading and request
for particulars
pleaded alternative global and/or modified total costs claim against Wood &
Grieve Engineers is reproduced
ALTERNATIVE CAUSATION & LOSS AND DAMAGE:
GLOBAL / MODIFIED TOTAL COSTS CLAIM
and in the alternative, to the allegations pleaded in paragraphs 67 to 73 above,
[CPB Contractors] advances a global and/or
modified total costs claim
against [Wood & Grieve Engineers], on the basis
(a) but for each and all of [Wood & Grieve Engineers'] breaches of the
Consultancy Agreement, as pleaded at paragraphs 43, 44
and 64 above,
[CPB Contractors] would have completed the:
(i) Stage One Works without incurring the costs of the additional resources and
preliminaries pleaded in paragraph 67 above;
(ii) Stage Two Works by the LD Milestone Dates for the Guaranteed Contract Sum
without incurring the costs of the additional resources
and preliminaries
pleaded in paragraph 73 above;
(iii) Stage Two Works by the LD Milestone Dates for the Guaranteed Contract Sum
without incurring the costs of the subcontractor
and supplier variations and
delay and disruption claims pleaded in paragraph 69 above;
(iv) Stage Two Works by the LD Milestone Dates for the Guaranteed Contract Sum
without the cost to [CPB Contractors] of completing
those works increasing
and exceeding that contained in the Stage Two
Particulars
(i) In relation to SWPs 7001, 3101, 4000, 6003 and 7002, and adjusting for
budget transfers between the SWPs and approved variations
to subcontractors
(which are further particularised in Appendix L), the table below shows the
calculation of [CPB Contractors'] loss
(ii) The costs set out in the sixth column of the above table do not include the
amounts particularised at paragraphs 69, 73(i),
73(ii) or 73(iii)
(iii) Further particulars may be provided following discovery and the exchange
of expert evidence prior to trial.
(b) if (which is denied) [CPB Contractors] is unable to identify with
sufficient particularity any part or parts of its loss or damage,
paragraph 74 above, attributable to each or any of [Wood & Grieve
Engineers'] breaches of the Consultancy Agreement,
as pleaded at paragraphs 43,
44 and 64 above, that is because it is impractical to do so for reasons which
are not attributable to
any delay or other conduct of
[CPB Contractors];
Particulars
(i) There is a highly complex interaction between each of the 209 Stage Two
Design Development and Contract Documentation, the 17,609
Revised Stage Two
Design Development and Contract Documentation, the delay and disruptive impact
on [CPB Contractors] and its hundreds
of suppliers and subcontractors
across the Elizabeth Quay Project, and the consequent impact on the progress of
the Stage One Works
and each of the interrelating 43 SWPs.
(ii) Further particulars will be provided following discovery and the exchange
of expert evidence prior to
(b-a) [CPB Contractors] is unable to identify with particularity that part
or parts of its loss or damage, pleaded in paragraph 75(a)(iv)
attributable to particular breaches of the Consultancy Agreement by [Wood &
Grieve Engineers], as pleaded at paragraphs
43, 44 and 64 above, because it
is impractical to do so for reasons which are not attributable to any delay or
other conduct of [CPB
Contractors];
Particulars
(i) The particulars to paragraph 75(b) above are repeated.
(c) other than [Wood & Grieve Engineers'] breaches of the Consultancy
Agreement, as pleaded at paragraphs 43, 44 and 64 above,
there are no
alternative causes of any significance of the loss or damage suffered by
[CPB Contractors] as pleaded at paragraphs
74 and 75(a)(iv) above; and
(d) the additional costs incurred by [CPB Contractors] forming part of its
loss or damage, being those pleaded at paragraphs 67,
73 and 75(a)(iv) above,
were reasonably and necessarily incurred by [CPB Contractors] by reason of
each or all of [Wood & Grieve
Engineers'] breaches of the Consultancy
Agreement, as pleaded at paragraphs 43, 44 and 64

4406, including but not
limited to:
(i) a description of the cost, to what entity it was paid (and on what date) and

Authority] or any other entity in respect of the
works the subject of each of
the following SWPs: 7001, 3101, 4001, 4004, 6003, 7002, 4406, 2001, 1101, 3003,
6008, 9100, 3002, 4307,
4303, 9001, and 4401, including but not limited to:
(i) a description of the payment, its amount, from what entity it was paid (and
on what date) and in respect of which claim made
by [CPB Contractors];
(ii) how each of those payments were allocated to the SWPs listed in (a) above,
including in relation any budget transfers;
(iii) identifying whether the payment was for:
(A) payment to an entity as part of an approved SWP;
(B) Direct Works carried out by [CPB Contractors];
(C) cost associated with an Approved Variation;

Overview of the parties'
Wood & Grieve
Engineers' position
for Wood & Grieve Engineers summarises the application as being a request
for further and better particulars
(a) each item of actual cost incurred in respect of SWP 7001, 3101, 4001, 4004,
6003, 7002, 4406, by way of a description of those
costs, and an explanation for
what each of those costs were for;
(b) each payment CPB Contractors obtained in respect of SWP 7001, 3101,
4001, 4004, 6003, 7002, 4406 and other SWPs, a description
of each of those
payments, how those payments were allocated to a SWP, and an explanation for
what each of those payments were for;
(c) how the global loss claimed by the CPB Contractors was caused or contributed
to by (all of) the breaches alleged against Wood
& Grieve Engineers seeks that the basis for CPB Contractors' global claim be
set out with specificity, so as to enable it
(a) prepare its defence and to comply with the Court's orders (which include an
order that non-expert evidence be filed by 27 March
2026 and that by
10 March 2026 the parties confer with a view of identifying the
respective disciplines of expert evidence to be
led at trial, a list of issues
or questions for expert evidence and the material to be provided to the experts
for them to consider
as part of preparing their expert
(b) efficiently review the (in the order of 200,000) discovered documents as
part of preparing its
& Grieve Engineers says that the requested further and better particulars
are necessary in order to facilitate the efficient,
timely and cost effective
management of this complex construction dispute, consistent with case management
principles.
Further, it says
(a) the provision of further particulars is contemplated in the pleading itself;
(b) the extent CPB Contractors needs to review its records to provide such
details, discovery has now been completed (and took a
considerable time);
(c) there is no proper basis for CPB Contractors to assert that it has to
procure its expert evidence in order to provide the particulars
requested. (That
is, CPB Contractors must have known the basis for the pleading when it pleaded
the matters it did in paragraph 75.
While expert evidence may supplement
other aspects of CPB Contractors' case, it cannot change the facts that were the
basis for the
matters currently pleaded); and
(d) Wood & Grieve Engineers needs to be able to understand how CPB
Contractors' claimed loss is derived in order to be able to
understand the case
it has to meet and prepare its defence.
further noted that, at a general level, CPB Contractors asserts that the loss is
the difference between its costs actually
incurred for each SWP and the amount
of the Guaranteed Contract Sum (a defined term) in the Stage Two Offer (as
adjusted by CPB Contractors
and referred to in the pleading as the 'Revised
Guaranteed Contract Sum', which is not a defined term in the Stage Two Offer or
Contracts).
In light of the same, counsel complained that the pleading infers that the total
amount CPB Contractors in fact received for the
performance of all the relevant
works was the amount of the Revised Guaranteed Contract Sum referrable to that
SWP, but that implicit
assertion cannot be assessed unless details are given as
to what amounts were in fact received for what works the subject of each
It was noted that this is particularly so when for certain SWPs the Guaranteed
Contract Sum in the Stage Two Offer included amounts
for provisional sums (which
were to be adjusted and paid depending on actual costs incurred rather than the
estimates the subject
of the provisional sum); and that provisional sum amounts
were included in SWP 7002 (expressly referred to in the Table) and SWPs
4307, 4303 and 9001 (included in the Table due to the budget transfers set out
in Appendix L).
a general level, Wood & Grieve Engineers says that it needs to know the
(a) what the global figure pleaded for the actual costs incurred is made up of
for each item of cost CPB Contractors relies upon
for calculating its alleged
loss (including, for example, what subcontractors, suppliers, consultants, or
other CPB Contractors resources
performed the relevant works for the SWP
resulting in the amounts making up the global sum pleaded in the fourth column
of the Table
being incurred); and
(b) what amounts were in fact received by CPB Contractors in respect of each
item of cost (including, for example, what amounts were
actually paid to CPB
Contractors (by the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority or other entities) in
respect of each item of work
done by those subcontractors, suppliers,
consultants, or other CPB Contractors resources for performing the relevant
works for the
maintains that the pleading ought also explain how the transfer of certain works
between SWPs (via budget transfers) and the impact
of variations were treated;
and that Wood & Grieve Engineers should not be left to search through the
discovery (including CPB
Contractors' costs records) to, in effect, guess for
itself what those details of CPB Contractors' claims
addition to the above, Wood & Grieve Engineers says that in order to
understand the case to be met and prepare its defence,
it needs to know how the
numerous breaches alleged have resulted in the loss claimed (albeit a
global/total sum with no specific
costs linked to any specific breach). That is,
CPB Contractors must at least particularise the alleged consequences of Wood
Grieve Engineers' breaches, by reference to what impact they had on the
works the subject of each SWP, which it is alleged led to
the additional costs
being incurred for the SWP - in other words how it is that the global/total loss
claimed was caused by (all
of) the breaches (and not other matters). It is
submitted that this is so regardless of whether a global claim is being
and that it is arguably more important in such a context.
is also submitted that CPB Contractors cannot have properly pleaded its claims
as currently advanced without knowing the impacts
the alleged breaches had that
it relied upon to be able to assert those breaches led to the additional costs
being incurred; and
that it cannot be said that it is impossible or impractical
for CPB Contractors to spell this level of detail out further in its
Wood & Grieve Engineers complain that while CPB Contractors has provided
some detail as to the costs that are part of
its global claim as pleaded at
paragraphs 75(a)(i), (ii) and (iii), it has not done so (and should now be
required to do so) for
the costs and loss claimed under
paragraph 75(a)(iv). It is also noted that it seems that the impacts on the
works and cost consequences
CPB Contractors relies upon to claim the loss the
subject of the global claim made under paragraph 75(a)(iv) are different to
the subject of paragraphs 75(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) (see
paragraph 75(a)(iv)(ii)).
submitted that the Court ought to consider the application in light of a number
of decisions. The first was that of Byrne
John Holland Construction
& Engineering Pty Ltd v Kvaerner RJ Brown Pty Ltd
(1996) 8 VR 681
, which concerned an application to strike out
substantial parts or the whole of a statement of claim in which the claim for
was framed on a global basis.
referred particularly to [13] to [23] of that decision, emphasising (among other
things) the observation made by Byrne J
that '[g]lobal claims are difficult
for the parties and the court to handle', and may hide a bogus
suggested that this Court's approach to the application for particulars ought be
informed by Byrne J's observations and suggested
approach to a global
and/or modified total costs claim recorded at [22] and [23], which are
reproduced below:
The question whether in a given case a pleading based on a global claim, or even
a total cost claim or some variant of this, is likely
to or may prejudice,
embarrass or delay the fair trial of a proceeding, must depend upon an
examination of the pleading itself and
the claim which it makes. The fundamental
concern of the court is that the dispute between the parties should be
determined expeditiously
and economically and, above all, fairly. Where the
proceeding is being managed in a specialist list, the judge, whose task it is
steer the case through its interlocutory stages, might, and perhaps should,
explore the claim to determine whether the form it
takes is driven by its nature
and complexity, or by a desire to conceal its bogus nature by presenting it in a
snowstorm of unrelated
and insufficiently particularised allegations, or by a
desire to disadvantage the defendant in some way. Relevant to this is an
acknowledgment
that a total cost claim puts a burden on the defendant. This
burden may involve the defendant in extensive discovery of documents
relating to
the performance of the project; it may mean that at trial the defendant must
cross-examine the plaintiff's witnesses
to expose the flaws in a claim which
assumes that the defendant is, itself, responsible for every item of the
plaintiff's cost overrun;
it may mean that the defendant must lead evidence to
explain what, in fact, was the impact of each of the acts complained of on the
project, as was done in
McAlpine Humberoak Ltd v
McDermott International Inc (No 1)
. Litigation inevitably imposes burdens
on the parties; the court must exercise its powers to ensure that, as far as
possible, these
burdens are not unreasonable and are not unnecessarily
In my opinion, the court should approach a total cost claim with a great deal of
caution, even distrust. I would not, however, elevate
this suspicion to the
level of concluding that such a claim should be treated as prima facie bad.
Nevertheless, the point of logical
weakness inherent in such claims, the causal
nexus between the wrongful acts or omissions of the defendant and the loss of
the plaintiff,
must be addressed. I put to one side the straightforward case
where each aspect of the nexus is apparent from the nature of the breach
loss as alleged. In such a case the objectives of the pleading may be achieved
by a short statement of the facts giving rise
to the causal nexus. If it is
necessary for the given case for this to be supported by particulars, this
should be done. But, in
other cases, each aspect of the nexus must be fully set
out in the pleading unless its probable existence is demonstrated by evidence
argument and further, it is demonstrated that it is impossible or impractical
for it to be spelt out further in the pleading.
Moreover, the court should be
assiduous in pressing the plaintiff to set out this nexus with sufficient
particularity to enable the
defendant to know exactly what is the case it is
required to meet and to enable the defendant to direct its discovery and its
generally to that case. And it should not be overlooked that an
important means of achieving the result that, once it starts, the
trial should
be conducted without undue prejudice, embarrassment and delay, is by ensuring
that, when it begins, the issues between
the parties including this nexus are
defined with sufficient particularity to enable the trial judge to address the
issues, to rule
on relevance and generally to contain the parties to those
issues. An order to this effect in a global claim was made by the Official
Chemical Industries Plc v Bovis Construction Ltd
, and by Moynihan J in
Ralph M Lee Pty Ltd v
Gardiner & Naylor Industries Pty Ltd
. And if, in such a case, the
plaintiff fails to demonstrate this causal nexus in sufficient detail because it
is unable or unwilling
to do so, then this may provide the occasion for the
court to relieve the defendant of the unreasonable burden which the plaintiff
would impose on it. [Footnotes omitted]
second was the decision of Byrne J in
Ipex ITG Pty Ltd v
Melbourne Water Corporation [No 3]
[2006] VSC 83
, a decision
which was referred to with approval by K Martin J in
Built Environs WA Pty Ltd
v Perth Airport Pty Ltd [No 3]
[2019] WASC 399
[90], which concerned an application by Ipex to deliver its proposed fourth
amended statement of claim (and consideration
of its fifth draft of the
had occurred before K Martin J, in the application prosecuted by Wood
& Grieve Engineers for further and better particulars,
counsel sought to
rely upon some observations by Byrne J made in the context of what looked
to be an 'hours claim' (not a global
claim) noting his Honour's ultimate
conclusion that the way that hours claim had been pleaded was inadequate and
embarrassing, leading
to pleading relief in that
J had in his reasons for decision recorded that in its proposed pleading, Ipex
had sought to discharge its burden of proof
by inviting the Court to infer
causation, which would only be discharged if the Court was satisfied that there
was no other causally
significant factor which contributed to hours spent by its
Noting that context, the following passage of Byrne J's reasons for
decision was referred to and emphasised by counsel for Wood &
The danger of this method of presenting such a claim is that it tends to shift
to the defendant the task of demonstrating that the
other factors for which it
is not legally responsible played such a causative role. It is for this reason
that the plea may be rejected
as embarrassing. But this conclusion will not
follow in every case. As Smith J pointed out in
Nauru Phosphate Royalties
Trust v Matthew Hall Mechanical and Electrical Engineers Ltd
that the evidentiary or shifting burden may pass to the defendant on a given
issue does not detract from the obligation
of Ipex to prove on the balance of
probabilities at the end of the day that the extra FTEs and their cost have in
fact been caused
by the increase in the number of Help Desk calls. It must be
accepted in the context of adversary litigation that this may be so
plaintiff has no obligation to make things easy for its adversary. Nevertheless,
it cannot be gainsaid that, as a matter
of forensic reality, this will often
impose a great burden upon the defendant which, in many cases, is less able than
the plaintiff
to know what occurred from day to day and the Court will be
concerned that this burden be not an unnecessary or unreasonable one.
this reason that the Court will be inclined to require the plaintiff to bring
forward 'the precise evidence' of its loss
which is within its power or to show
why that is not reasonable or practicable. [Footnotes omitted]
submitted that similarly it ought be incumbent upon CPB Contractors to identify
how it says the various breaches alleged
impacted upon the works to cause the
additional amounts claimed on a global basis, even if it cannot identify each
specific loss
attributable to a particular breach, as sought by
paragraph 2(c) of the revised request for further particulars. Wood &
Engineers maintains that it needs to know how CPB Contractors says the
various breaches together led to the global sum claimed, so
it may consider and
interrogate the asserted causal link, and progress its defence to
it says that its application is not a request for evidence, and complains that
'[a]s it currently stands, the "costs" (and
resulting "loss") pleaded by CPB
Contractors at paragraph 75(a) are simply numbers on a page with no
adequate explanation of what
those numbers relate
Despite being a global claim, it presses for CPB Contractors to identify the
impact of the alleged breaches on the works which is
said to lead to the global
loss having been incurred, which detail is necessary to understand the
complains that the position adopted by CPB Contractors requires it to wait for

CPB Contractors' case on its global claim. It says that such an approach is not
consistent with the overriding
objectives of case management and delay under
O 1 r 4A and 4B of the
Rules of the
Supreme Court 1971
CPB Contractors' position
Contractors maintain that the application ought to be dismissed on its merits
(a) the Court should not be satisfied that there is a sufficient basis to
exercise its discretion to grant the leave sought;
(b) alternatively, Wood & Grieve Engineers is not entitled to the
particulars sought because they are a request for evidence;
(c) in the further alternative, Wood & Grieve Engineers' request ought to be
denied when regard is had to case management
principles.

exercise discretion

is the position of CPB Contractors that, consistent with the above, the
application should be dismissed
(a) there has been significant delay in making the request, as paragraph
75(a)(iv) and Appendix L have remained unchanged for over
three and a half years
(that is, since the filing of the amended statement of claim on 14 February
(b) Wood & Grieve Engineers has provided no explanation, much less any
reasonable explanation, for the cause of its delay in
making the requests, other
than an asserted reliance on CPB Contractors' statement in its further amended
pleading that further particulars
of paragraph 75(a)(iv) may be provided
after discovery and the exchange of expert evidence (the latter of which has not
yet occurred);
(c) Wood & Grieve Engineers did not need the particulars to adequately plead
its defence and counterclaim, amended defence and
counterclaim or
re‑amended defence and counterclaim (filed on 26 August 2022,
10 October 2022 and 21 December 2022, respectively);

extent they are in fact particulars) to be provided

and seeking to avoid the work associated with having to 'go and sift through'
the documents Wood & Grieve Engineers requested
from CPB Contractors by way
of targeted discovery
CPB Contractors maintains that none of these reasons provide a proper basis for
ordering the provision of further particulars, particularly
when the process for
the preparation and exchange of expert and lay evidence has now commenced, and a
trial is not expected to take
place until at least

particulars should only be ordered to be provided where
they are necessary to

identification of the case that has

respond to the case pleaded with sufficient precision

emphasise that particulars must also

permits because the case may be obscured by too much detail, and unnecessary

(reproduced at [22] above), is pressed so that CPB
Contractors might 'pin its
colours to the mast', without the loss to Wood & Grieve Engineers of its
CPB Contractors complain that it appears that one purpose of the request is to
fetter CPB Contractors' case at trial by requiring
it to provide unnecessarily
detailed particulars before the exchange of evidence, which is not a proper
basis on which to make an
order for the provision of further and better
particulars.
Further, it complains that the request made at paragraph 2(c) ignores, and
is inconsistent with, the manner in which CPB Contractors
expressly pleads its

Request for evidence
is noted above, the application is opposed on the basis that Wood & Grieve
Engineers is not entitled to the particulars sought
because they are a request
for evidence. CPB Contractors complains that the requests made at
paragraphs 2(a) and (b) of the revised
minute (reproduced at [22] above),
seek evidence by way of a description of the actual costs and payments and
identification of what
each cost or payment was for; and the request made at
paragraph 2(b) also seeks particulars and evidence in relation to SWPs that
are neither referred to in paragraph 75(a)(iv) nor Appendix L of the
pleading (that is, SWP 2001, 1101, 3003, 6008, 9100, 3002, 4307,

is, consistent with modern case management principles, the application for
further and better particulars should be considered
in the context of
directions.
In this proceeding, directions made on 27 August 2025 require the
parties to take certain steps between 28 November 2025 and
2026, so as to identify and confer in relation to the
respective disciplines of expert evidence to be led at trial and the list of
issues or questions for expert evidence; and for CPB Contractors to provide to
Wood & Grieve Engineers an indication of the material
it intends to brief
the experts with by 28 November 2025.
Contractors says that this material will enable Wood & Grieve Engineers to
'efficiently review the, in the order of 200,000,
discovered documents as part
of preparing its defence', said to be needed before the deadline imposed on CPB
Contractors (by 28 November
2025) and the reciprocal deadline imposed
on Wood & Grieve Engineers (of 13 February
It maintains that it should not be required to identify or summarise the
evidence sought in the request prior to compliance with
the orders above and the
exchange of expert evidence. It complains that compelling the production of the
additional particulars sought

Rules of the Supreme Court
O 20 r 13(3), the Court may order a party to serve on any other party
particulars of any claim, defence or other matter stated in
that party's
pleading, and the order may be made on such terms as the Court thinks just. As
to the principles to be applied, I refer
to and apply the observations made in
Youlden Enterprises Pty
Ltd v Health Solutions (WA) Pty Ltd
[2005] WASC 55
[4], as if set out here in full.
I proceed on the basis that refusal of a request for further and better
particulars may be justified in circumstances where
there has been a delay in
the making of a request, the delay was substantial and there is no good cause
for it, and furthermore where
the applicant did not need the particulars
requested to adequately plead its case and prepare for
to the approach of the Court to pleading issues in light of current case
management principles, I also have regard to the observations
Le Miere J in
Wright Prospecting Pty Ltd
v Hancock Prospecting Pty Ltd [No 6]
at [46], reproduced
The court discourages disputes relating to pleading issues which consume
substantial amounts of time and expense which is often disproportionate
significance to the just and effective resolution of the case. The approach of
the court to pleading disputes must take
into account the purposes of pleading.
Those purposes relevantly include informing the court and the other parties of
the case of
the party putting forward the pleading. The contemporary role of
pleadings has to be viewed in the context of contemporary case management
techniques and pre-trial directions which include the preparation of a trial
bundle identifying the documents that are to be adduced
in evidence in the
course of the trial and the exchange of witness statements and expert reports
prior to trial. Nevertheless, the
fundamental proposition concerning pleadings
is that a party is entitled to be informed about the opponent's case with
clarity to allow that party a fair opportunity to meet the case. The
court will intervene if the parties do not identify with reasonable
just what is and what is not in dispute.
weighed all of the circumstances and the submissions made by counsel, including
the matters set out below, the application
will be refused.
there has been delay on the part of Wood & Grieve Engineers in seeking
further and better particulars, which I do not
consider to be satisfactorily
explained by reference to the time taken to complete discovery, the parties'
early attempts at mediation
or otherwise.
said, it is clear that the action is still in its interlocutory stage, unlikely
to be entered for trial in 2026, with some prospect
of entry in
While there has been significant delay in seeking further and better
particulars, the delay is not determinative of the outcome of
application.
in my view, CPB Contractors has pleaded its claim with sufficient particularity
so as to allay any concern as to it being
a bogus claim. Further, a review of
the pleading does not suggest that its form was driven by a desire to
disadvantage the defendant
in some way, but rather the nature and complexity of
I accept that distinguishing between material facts, particulars and evidence is
and the obligation to give particulars does not require a party to disclose the
evidence by which that party proposes to prove its
case. Nevertheless,
particulars must make the plaintiff's claim plain so that each party may know
what are the issues of fact to
be investigated in the
also accept that it is imperative that once it starts, the trial should be
conducted without undue prejudice, embarrassment and
delay, which is best
facilitated by ensuring that when it begins, the issues between the parties,
including the nexus, are defined
with sufficient particularity to enable a trial
judge to address the issues, to rule on relevance, and generally to contain the
my view, at this stage of the proceeding, the particulars provided are adequate,
when regard is had to the following:
(a) CPB Contractors' pleaded claims were sufficiently clear so as to allow a
defence to be filed;
(b) regardless of the outcome of this application, Wood & Grieve Engineers
agree to provide source documents for the actual costs
referred to in the Table
at paragraph 75(a)(iv) of the further amended statement of claim; and each
payment from the Metropolitan
Redevelopment Authority or any other entity in
respect of the works the subject of the following SWPs: 7001, 3101, 4001,
4004, 6003,
7002, 4406 (which documents I understand have been discovered in the
proceeding).
While CPB Contractors will likely still engage in an extensive review of the
documents discovered, the burden is somewhat lightened
by the agreed
identification of evidence within the extensive discovery;
(c) the need for the provision of further particulars (or the urgency of the
need) is ameliorated by the orders made to date concerning
the filing and
service of lay and expert evidence prior to trial. That is, by
28 November 2025 CPB Contractors must provide Wood
Engineers with an indication of the respective disciplines of expert evidence
intended to be led at trial, a list of
issues or questions for expert evidence
and the material to be provided to the experts for them to consider as part of
their reports. In this case, compliance with the orders made to date
with respect to lay and expert evidence, and then the filing
of that evidence,
ought result in Wood & Grieve Engineers knowing well in advance of trial
what evidence will be put against
balance, I am satisfied that proceeding as contemplated by the orders made on
27 August 2025 (and the contemplated service of
expert evidence well
in advance of trial), will facilitate the efficient, timely and
cost‑effective management of this complex
construction dispute, consistent
with case management principles. Given the stage of the proceeding, fairness,
efficiency and proportionality
will not be so improved or promoted as to tip the
balance in favour of ordering the provision of further and better
particulars.
it will likely be prudent for the parties to revisit particulars after service
of lay witness outlines/statements and expert
evidence, it is not necessary for
the Court to now intervene. If in due course it considers necessary, Wood &
Grieve Engineers
may seek directions concerning the filing of responsive
non‑expert evidence and for the provision of expert evidence to be
staggered rather than exchanged. The application will be dismissed and I will
hear the parties as to costs if not agreed.
