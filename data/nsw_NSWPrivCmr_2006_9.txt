Refusal to grant access to medical records [2006] NSWPrivCmr 9 (1 July 2006)
Refusal to grant access to medical records
This is a case regarding access to medical records. In this case, a person
(K) sought access to their medical records from a general
practitioner. The
general practitioner worked for a medical centre.
The medical centre refused to give the person access to their records under
Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002
the medical centre of its responsibilities. Unfortunately this had little effect
and the medical centre still
refused to release the records, although it offered
to provide a written summary to the patient at a price.
Accordingly Privacy NSW issued a report to both parties to the complaint
Health Records and Information Privacy Act
issuing of a report enables a complainant to take the matter to the
Administrative Decisions Tribunal (the Tribunal).
Note: The Commissioner has issued a number of such reports in the 2006-07
financial year, and in at least one case, the complainant
has proceeded to the
Tribunal and obtained access to their records.
