J Gould v Forest Practices Authority [2009] TASFPT 5 (7 August 2009)
File No: 2/0F D5/2009
J Gould Appellant
Forest Practices Authority Respondent
This was the hearing of an appeal against the refusal by the Forest
Practices Authority to certify Forest Practices Plan RSS0004 on
property at Dover.
The appeal was heard at Hobart on 3

Plan was as follows:
18(3) of the Act requires that with respect to Forest Practices Plans

Section D.3.2 of
the Forest Practices Code contains the general principles and basic approach to
be used in the planning and assessment
Section D.3.3 of
the Forest Practices Code identifies that threatened species are to be managed
in accordance with legislation and
processes including the Commonwealth
Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Act,
the Tasmanian
Threatened Species Protection Act
and the Tasmanian Regional Forest
Agreement. The swift parrot is listed as a threatened species, or a species
requiring conservation
management, under these Acts and the Agreement.
Section D.3.3 of
the Forest Practices Code also identifies that threatened species will be
managed in wood production areas in accordance
with procedures agreed between
the Forest Practices Authority and DPIW. These include the use of planning
tools (e.g. Threatened
Fauna Advisor) and the requirement for Forest
Practices officers to incorporate recommendations from such planning tools into
Forest Practices Plan, or to obtain an endorsed management prescription for
any threatened species that occur or potentially occur
within areas proposed for
forest operations. As the generic prescriptions in the Threatened Fauna Advisor
are currently under revision
the Authority consulted directly with the
Threatened Species Section to determine a specific management prescription for
covered by the Forest Practices Plan, noting that the site has
potentially high significance for the swift parrot.
In refusing the
Forest Practices Plan the Authority was cognizant of the provisions of
Part 5 Division 4 of the
Nature Conservation Act
, which provides
that an ‘affected landowner’ who has an application for a Forest
Practices Plan refused by the Authority
for the purposes of protecting a
threatened species may apply to the Minister for compensation to be
evidence of Mr F Duncan on behalf of the Forest Practices Authority, was in
summary as follows:
“The proposed operation is for conversion of native forest to
plantation, with 40 of the 43.8 ha in the FPP area comprising
wet forest. The proposed land use is not compatible with
maintaining swift parrot habitat in the FPP area. The swift parrot is
an endangered species in the
Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act
and the Commonwealth
Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation
The forest in the FPP area has been referred to the Threatened Species
Section (DPIW) for advice on management of swift parrots, in
relation to
previous proposed operations involving clear felling of wet
forest. Specialists in TSS endorsed recommendations to exclude proposed
forestry operations from areas of this forest type.
Factors taken into account in refusing the FPP include:
The large area of
forest proposed for conversion;
The recent use of
forest in this part of the State by swift
parrots; and
The relatively small extent of the community in the vicinity of the property
because of historic and recent losses.”
detailed evidence of Mr Duncan elaborated and substantiated that
evidence was not contested, and there was no evidence to the contrary; the
Tribunal finds according to that evidence.
consequence, the Tribunal necessarily finds that the Forest Practices Plan is
not consistent with the provisions of the Forest
Practices Code in the above
respects. The Forest Practices Plan not being in accordance with
Section 18 of the
Forest Practices Act 1985
, in that it was not in
accordance with the Forest Practices Code in force at the time it was prepared
(or at the present), the appropriate
course for the Forest Practices Authority
was to refuse to certify the plan.
was contended on behalf of the Appellant that the provisions of the Forest
Practices Code 2000, Part D pages 51 and 52 with respect
to conservation of
natural and cultural values, were applicable. Reliance was placed upon the
‘basic approach’ with
respect to those matters which provides
that the sustainable management of natural and cultural values
within production forests under the Forest Practices System will be
in accordance with:
“- the duty of care of landowners under the provisions of this Code,
which is defined as the fundamental contribution of the
landowner to the
conservation of natural and cultural values that are deemed to be significant
under the Forest Practices System.
The landowner’s duty of care
All measures

circumstances where partial harvesting of the reserve area is compatible with
the protection of the values, the level will be
up to 10 per cent. The
conservation of values beyond the duty of care is deemed to be for the community
benefit and should be achieved
on a voluntary basis or through compensation
mechanisms where available.”
‘basic approach’ cited above must give way to the more specific
provisions of Section D.3.3 of the Forest Practices
Code 2000, identifying the
management of threatened species in wood production areas. To do otherwise,
would mean that provision
of the required 5 or 10 per cent reserve would be
sufficient to achieve appropriate conservation in every case, which cannot be

was given by Mr Gould that refusal of the Forest Practices Plan would have the
effect that he would be deprived of the very
substantial income which would be
received from harvesting the timber in the Plan area. The Tribunal accepts that
evidence, which
was not controverted. The Tribunal notes the provisions of
Part 5 of the
Nature Conservation Act 2002
, entitling persons in the
position of the Appellant to apply for compensation in the event of a refusal to
certify a Forest Practices
Plan. Such a right arises in the case of a refusal
wholly or partially on the ground that implementation of the plan would threaten
a threatened species or involve the clearance or conversion of a threatened
native vegetation community, and where an appeal to the
Forest Practices
Tribunal under Section 25(1) of that Act in respect of that refusal has been
wholly or partially dismissed. That
will be the appellant’s
decision of the Tribunal is that the refusal of the Forest Practices Authority,
to certify the Forest Practices Plan, is upheld.
Tribunal will entertain any application for an order for costs in this appeal,
if made to the Tribunal in writing with supporting
submissions within the next
14 days. If requested the Tribunal will reconvene to hear any evidence in
respect of any matter bearing
on an order for costs.
the absence of any such application for an order for costs the order of the
Tribunal is that each party bears its own costs.
