Who’s Fingerprints, And With What Flavour, Would You Like Today?
Who’s fingerprints, and with what flavour, would
you like today?
Dr Dan Jerker B. Svantesson
The spread of the use of biometrics has been explosive. Fingerprints, for
example, are being used for a range of purposes, such as
for controlling access
into buildings and for logging onto computers. Furthermore, there are plans to
incorporate fingerprint technology
in mobile phones. In addition, the US has put
pressure on the 27 countries covered by its visa waiver program to begin issuing
with biometric identification information. Until recently, two Swedish
schools even used fingerprint technology to ensure that only
students who were
entitled to the lunch provided could access it. There simply seem to be no end
to the uses to which fingerprint
technologies can be put.
However, there are several reasons to think that too much faith is being
placed in these technologies. The technologies using fingerprints
identification are not completely accurate, and there are ways to fool the
fingerprint readers currently in use.
Making an artificial fingerprint
The Swedish Data Inspection Board’s publication
reported how Marie Sandström
, a technology student at
Linköping Institute of Technology, set out to verify Tsutomo
Matsumoto’s method of making false
fingerprints. Her approach was both
interesting and surprisingly simple.
Using the same method applied for decades by the police, she obtained a
fingerprint of one of her colleagues; To illustrate how easily
someone can copy
your fingerprint, the fingerprint was obtained from a piece of glass (how many
glass surfaces have you touched today?).
A soot mixture was carefully applied to
the fingerprint, which allowed the print to be lifted onto a white paper using
adhesive tape.
The fingerprint was subsequently photographed and digitally
enhanced using imaging software. The finished print was then ready to
transferred onto a gelatine solution (similar to materials used in the
manufacturing of some forms of “gummy-like”
candy, which actually
means that you could flavour the artificial fingerprint!) and the artificial
fingerprint was complete.
Testing the artificial fingerprint
To evaluate the efficiency of her “product”, Sandström
performed tests comparing her colleagues genuine fingerprint
with her gelatine
fingerprint copy, on nine different fingerprint recognition systems at the CeBIT
trade fair in Hannover, Germany.
All systems were fooled:
The mean value of the success rate [the rate at which successful
verifications or identifications are made compared to the total number
trials] using real fingerprints was 90%, and the mean values of the FAR [False
Acceptance Rate] with artificial fingerprints were
[...] 86% [in the second
round of experiments which achieved the best results]
What can we learn from this?
The fact that it is possible to copy and use another persons fingerprints
must be taken seriously. Even leaving aside the enormous
implications this has
in relation to forensic evidence, this is a great cause for concern. While it
seems clear that, it is unlikely
that we will witness a widespread use of
artificial fingerprints to access computers or free school lunches, it is
necessary to question
whether it is justified to invest large amounts of money
and resources in developing fingerprint scanners as a means of ensuring
level of security in our society.
The evaluation of whether such investments are justified must always involve
the balancing of the security benefits on the one hand,
and the impact on the
fundamental human right of privacy on the other. In light of the possibility of
making artificial fingerprints,
the security benefits may not necessarily be as
great as previously though. The privacy implications, however, remain as
