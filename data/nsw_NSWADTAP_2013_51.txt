REASONS FOR
Introduction
has appealed against two decisions of the Guardianship Tribunal made on 21
August 2013. The first decision was to make a guardianship
order in relation to
him and to appoint the Public Guardian as his guardian for three months. The
second decision was to make a financial
management order in relation to his
estate and to appoint the NSW Trustee and Guardian as his financial manager for
three months.
BBZ did not appear at the hearing when these orders were made.
BBV, a long-term friend of BBZ's but from whom she is now estranged,
applicant in the Guardianship Tribunal proceedings.
well as appealing against the Guardianship Tribunal's orders, BBZ applied for an
interlocutory order to prevent the Guardianship
Tribunal's orders from having
any effect until this Tribunal determined his appeal:
Administrative
Decisions Tribunal Act
That application was
refused on 4 November 2013. BBZ and BBV both appeared in person. It was
necessary to have a sheriff present
to ensure that they did not abuse or
threaten one another. I note that BBZ applied for an apprehended personal
violence order against
BBV on the 12 August 2013. There was no evidence that
such an order has been granted. BBV says she has applied for an apprehended
violence order against BBZ. We do not know the status of that application.
the extreme animosity between BBZ and BBV exhibited during the application for
an interlocutory order, we chose to determine
the substantive application on the
basis of the Notice of Appeal and written submissions. We are satisfied that the
issues can be
determined adequately in the absence of the parties: ADT Act, s
76. We are also mindful of the fact that the orders against which
appealed are due to expire on 21 November 2013. The Guardianship Tribunal has
re-listed the matter to determine whether further
orders should be to made. That
hearing is scheduled for 18 November 2013.
those circumstances, directions were made for the parties to file any further
submissions or documents in relation to the substantive
appeal by 11 November
2013. None were filed. We indicated that we would provide written reasons for
our decision before 15 November
Parties and submissions
BBZ or BBV had legal representation. The NSW Trustee and Guardian advised that
it did not wish to present a case or make submissions.
The Guardianship Tribunal
elected to be a party but, apart from providing relevant documents, did not make
play any role in the proceedings.
Administrative Decisions Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear this external appeal:
Guardianship Act
(Guardianship Act),
and ADT Act, s 118A.
An appeal may be made as of right on a question of law and, with leave, on any
other ground: ADT Act, s 118B(1).
In his notice of appeal BBZ said that the
grounds of his appeal were questions of mixed law and fact. He said that the
Guardianship
Tribunal's orders were made on irrelevant and improper grounds.
Grounds of appeal
on the material filed by BBZ, the grounds of appeal appear to be that:
application to the Guardianship Tribunal was not bona fide and she is suffering
from a mental illness; and
Guardianship Tribunal based its decision on medical opinion that is "very old
and most certainly outdated."
fact that the Guardianship Tribunal determined the application in his absence
was not a ground of appeal.
note from what was said during the application for an interlocutory order that
BBZ is most concerned about the fact that his Disability
Support Pension will no
longer be paid directly into his account. He asks that the appeal be allowed on
compassionate grounds because
of the financial difficulties he will face.
Bona fides and 'standing'
person who has "a genuine concern for the welfare of the person" is entitled to
apply for a guardianship and/or a financial management
Guardianship
s 25I(1)(b).
BBV applied to Guardianship Tribunal for
guardianship and financial management orders in relation to BBZ on 4 July 2013.
She describes
herself in those applications as a "long standing friend." The
Guardianship Tribunal did not make an express finding that BBV was
entitled to
apply for the orders but we assume that the Tribunal was satisfied that BBV had
a "genuine concern" for BBZ's welfare.
decision that a person has standing to make an application to the Guardianship
Tribunal under
is not a decision that can be appealed to this
Guardianship Act
Appealable decisions are defined in
Guardianship Act
and a decision that a person has a genuine concern for the
welfare of the person is not a decision that can be the subject of appeal
this Tribunal. Consequently we have not power to hear an appeal against that
Old medical evidence
deciding whether it should make a guardianship order the Guardianship Tribunal
had to determine whether BBZ has a disability which
prevents him from being able
to make important life decisions:
Guardianship Act
The Tribunal
had before it nine medical reports from psychiatrists and others bearing various
dates from 2000 to 2011. The Guardianship
Tribunal found that:
The information contained in these reports reveals that BBZ has
been diagnosed with schizophrenia. He has been incarcerated on a number
occasions, having come into contact with the criminal justice system. He has a
history of using "ice" (meth amphetamine). BBZ
has also been a victim of abuse.
His first contact with the judicial system was as a juvenile.
Numerous reports refer to BBZ's grandiose delusions and a lack of insight
into his mental illness. He expressed the view to Dr Roberts
that he is the
centre of a conspiracy involving the State. Dr Roberts diagnosed a paranoid
schizophrenic illness.
Dr Adams referred to an earlier report of Dr Wilcox, forensic psychiatrist,
not provided to the tribunal, dated 28 July 2008. Dr Wilcox
said that BBZ has
severe disturbance in his personality, with a paranoid personality disorder with
antisocial traits.
the medical evidence was uncontested the Tribunal accepted it and found that BBZ
has a mental illness which prevents him making
important life decisions. BBZ
appealed on the basis that the medical reports are out of date. The Guardianship
Tribunal provided
this Tribunal with copies of the reports.
sought to tender a 1993 medical report from Dr James Lahood. That report stated
that, in his opinion, BBZ "has recently improved
in respect to his behaviour
disturbances." We did not accept this report into evidence because a medical
report written 20 years
ago which says nothing about the nature of BBZ's illness
at that time, is irrelevant to the issue of the nature and extent of any
disability BBZ may have today.
accept that all the medical evidence on which the Guardianship Tribunal relied
was at least 2 years old. The Guardianship Tribunal
did not make an error of law
by relying on that evidence because it was reasonable to assume, given BBZ's
documented history of mental
illness, that his diagnosis has not changed in the
last 2 years. The Guardianship Tribunal also heard evidence from BBV that she
has noticed a rapid decline in BBZ's mental health in recent times. She told the
Tribunal that BBZ was mentally unwell and believes
he needs urgent treatment.
BBZ did not attend the Guardianship Tribunal or provide contrary medical
evidence. The Guardianship Tribunal
made an order for a relatively short period
of time (3 months) to give BBZ the opportunity to provide further evidence,
further medical evidence.
has not identified a question of law and we are not satisfied that leave should
be granted to hear an appeal against the merits
of the Guardianship Tribunal's
The appeal is dismissed.
