Employment Agency Contracts
Declaration by Clients Exempt under Section 10
Revenue Ruling PT.124
Replaces PT.108
As a consequence of the
State Taxation Acts
(Tax Reform) Act 2004
, the employment
agency contract provisions contained in
sections 3D, 3E and 3F of the
Pay-roll Tax Act
(the Act) cease on 31 December 2004.
New employment agency contract provisions,
under PART II of the Act, take effect from
The new provisions define an
agency contract
a contract, whether formal or informal and
whether express or implied, under which a
person (the employment agent) procures the
services of another person (the service
provider) for a client of the employment agent.
Although the definition of an employment
agency contract remains largely unchanged,
the liability for Pay-roll Tax under the new
provisions shifts from the client of the
employment agent to the employment agent
The new provisions deem:
(a) the employment agent to be the employer
of the service provider; and
(b) the person who performs work for, or in
relation to which services are supplied to
the client (the on-hired worker) to be an
employee of the employment agent; and
(c) any amount paid or payable to or in
relation to the service provider (gross
payment excluding GST) to be wages
paid or payable by the employment agent,
� any employer superannuation
contribution made in respect of the
on-hired worker;
� the value of any fringe benefits provided
to the on-hired worker.
An exemption for the employment agent is
provided under section 5(3) of the Act,
for the wages paid to the on-hired worker,
under an employment agency contract, where:
(a) the wages would be exempt from Pay-roll
Tax under section 10 of the Act had the
on-hired worker been paid by the client as
an employee; and
(b) the client has provided a declaration to
that effect to the employment agent, in
respect of the on-hired worker
(a relevant
declaration)
Organisations that are exempt from Pay-roll
Tax under section 10 of the Act include:
Charitable bodies;
Public Benevolent Institutions (PBI's);
Religious Institutions;
Public Hospitals;
Not-for-profit Private Hospitals;
Municipalities;
Certain not-for-profit schools; and
State school councils within the meaning
Education Act
It should be noted that the wages paid by
exempt organisations are only exempt from
pay-roll tax to the extent provided under
section 10 of the Act.
Furthermore, it should also be noted that in
the case of employment agency contracts the
exemption provided to school councils, under
section 10(1)(ca) of the Act is subject to a
further qualification. Section 5(3A) of the Act
limits the exemption to those amounts,
benefits or payments paid to the on-hired
worker on or after 1
The purpose of this ruling is to clarify the
requirements that employment agents need to
satisfy in order to claim their entitlement to an
exemption under section 5(3) of the Act on the
Revenue Rulings

wages paid to their on-hired workers, who
provide services to clients that are exempt
under section 10 of the Act.
Relevant Declaration
An employment agent, in calculating its
Pay-roll Tax liability, may exclude those wages
that are exempt under section 5(3) of the Act,
where the employment agent has obtained a
relevant declaration
from its client.
Section 5(3) of the Act states as follows:
Sub-section 1(c) does not apply to an
employment agency contract to the extent that
an amount, benefit or payment referred to in
that sub-section would be exempt from pay-roll
tax under section 10 had the service provider
been paid by the client as an employee, if the
client has given a declaration to that effect to
the employment agent.
The relevant declaration must be in writing
and state that:
(i) the client is exempt under section 10 of
the Act; and
(ii) the services provided by the on-hired
worker for the client of the employment
agent, are services that are also exempt
under section 10 of the Act.
10. SRO Pay-roll Tax Form 9 entitled,
Pay-roll Tax, Employment Agency Contracts -
Declaration by Client
may be used to make the
declaration. SRO Pay-roll Tax Form 9 is
available on
www.sro.vic.gov.au
This form is not a prescribed form and
employment agents are free to develop their
own version of the declaration.
11. Employment agents should be aware that they
will be liable for any Pay-roll Tax if a
declaration made by their client is found to be
incomplete or does not meet the requirements
shown in paragraph 9 of this Revenue Ruling.
Accordingly, employment agents must ensure
that their clients, who qualify for an exemption
under section 10 of the Act, complete the
declaration fully.
Incorrect declaration
12. Where it is found that a client that has
provided an employment agent with a relevant
declaration is not exempt under section 10 of
the Act, or where the on-hired worker is not
utilised by the client in an exempt activity, the
employment agent will be exonerated from
any Pay-roll Tax liability provided the
employment agent has at all times acted in
good faith.
Where the Commissioner of State Revenue (the
Commissioner) believes the employment agent
has not acted in good faith, the Commissioner
may impose Pay-roll Tax liability against that
employment agent.
Frequency of Declaration
13. Although the Act requires a separate
declaration for each employment agency
contract entered into between the employment
agent and their client(s), the Commissioner
recognises that this requirement may be
impractical and onerous.
14. The Commissioner will be satisfied if the
employment agent obtains one relevant
declaration from its client (that is exempt under
section 10 of the Act) each calendar year
where the type of work performed by all
persons on-hired by that employment agent to
that client is identical.
Employment agents must ensure that
declarations are 'renewed' with their clients
prior to the commencement of each calendar
Agent 1 hires six workers to Client 1 (that is a
public hospital) who will all be performing
accounts payable work for Client 1. Agent 1
only needs to obtain one relevant declaration
from Client 1 for each calendar year that
Agent 1 on-hires any workers to Client 1 that
will be doing accounts payable work for Client
1. If Agent 1 then on-hires three engineers to
Client 1, a separate declaration will be required
with respect to the work being performed by
the engineers.
Application for refund made by an employment
15. Where an employment agent has paid tax on
wages under an employment agency contract
on or after 1 January 2005, and is
subsequently made aware that its client is
exempt under section 10 of the Act, the
employment agent may claim a refund (under
the provisions of Section 19 of the
Administration Act 1997
(TAA) - see Revenue
Ruling TAA.002) of the tax previously paid.
16. In support of any refund application made in
accordance with the TAA, the employment
agent must provide a
relevant declaration
written confirmation from the client stating that
the declaration is made for a retrospective
Ruling No. PT.124
period correlating to the period of the refund
17. Employment agents should be aware that any
refund application is subject to the windfall
gain provisions contained in section 22 of the
Record keeping by employment agent
18. Employment agents are required to keep all
declarations made in accordance with this
Revenue Ruling for a period of five (5) years.
Employment agents must also ensure they are
able to readily produce any declaration if
requested by the Commissioner.
Employment agents should not send completed
declarations to the SRO - the declarations must
be held by the employment agent.
Anti-avoidance provisions
19. Section 5A of the Act contains anti-avoidance
provisions empowering the Commissioner to
impose a liability for Pay-roll Tax on any
payment made by any party to an employment
agency contract, including the client of the
employment agent or the service provider.
Please note that rulings do not have the force of
law. Each decision made by the State Revenue
Office is made on the merits of each individual
case having regard to any relevant ruling. All
rulings must be read subject to Revenue Ruling
