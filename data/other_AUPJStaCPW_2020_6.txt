2.1 The Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) seeks
approval from the Committee to proceed with the proposed fit
out of new leased
premises at 100 Market Street, Sydney NSW. The aim of the project is to align
ASIC’s Sydney office with the
standard Activity Based Working (ABW) fit
out model, and facilitate an increase in Sydney staff numbers following the $404
in additional funding provided to implement the recommendations from the
Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking Superannuation
and Financial
Services Industry (Banking Royal
Commission).
2.2 The estimated cost of the project is $29.8 million (excluding GST).
2.3 The project was referred to the Committee on 27 November 2019.

2.4 Following referral, the inquiry was publicised on the Committee’s
website and via media release.
2.5 The Committee received one submission, one supplementary submission and
one confidential submission. A list of submissions can
be found at Appendix

and in-camera hearing in Sydney, New South Wales. A transcript
of the public
hearing is available on the Committee’s website.
Need for the works
2.7 ASIC is Australia's integrated corporate, markets, financial services and
consumer credit regulator. As an independent Commonwealth
Government body, ASIC
administers the
Australian Securities and Investments
Commission Act
(ASIC Act) and carries out most of its work under the

In their submission to the
committee, ASIC stated that:
Following the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation
and Financial Services Industry and the announcement
in March 2019 of $404m

placed under immediate increased
pressure in all offices, including
Sydney office is currently located at 100 Market Street and accommodates 1,078
staff in 1,062 traditional workpoints
over 18,475 meters
However, as a result of
the increase in funding from the Royal Commission, ASIC estimates Sydney staff
numbers will increase to approximately
1,350 from July
2.10 In planning for the expiry of the current lease on 31
2020 at 100 Market Street Sydney, and the estimated staff increase, ASIC told
the Committee that it ‘sought expressions
of interest from the market in
January 2018 to establish whether there might be more suitable accommodation to
meet future needs.’
ASIC stated that:
...as a result of that process, ASIC identified the existing 100 Market Street
premises as providing the best value for money lease
option, given the financial
offering of a below market rent and strong landlord incentive, its location and
accessibility to stakeholders
and available amenity for
told the Committee that:
To ensure ASIC’s Sydney office can accommodate required staff numbers in a
flexible and efficient manner, a full office fit
out project is proposed. The
current fit out has reached the end of its usable life and does not meet the
Commonwealth’s density
requirements. It also does not encourage or enable
more modern ways of working where workplace settings better support the
staff are undertaking, respond to and incorporate new technology and
support great collaboration and increased
innovation.
addition, ASIC stated in their submission that as a result of a national
consultation process in 2014, ‘ASIC has developed
its own Activity Based
Working (ABW) model...[that] will improve the workplace density from 16.3 square
meters per workpoint in the
current fit out to 11.6 square
2.13 At the public hearing Ms Dixon told the Committee that:
[ASIC’s] standard ABW fit out is based on ASICs specific operational
requirements and work practices and will position ASIC
for the future, allowing
us to attract and retain staff and be flexible with growth requirements...
ASIC’s ABW fit out has
already been delivered in Adelaide, Hobart, and
Perth offices, and is currently being implemented in
Options considered
2.14 In their submission, ASIC noted that:
...an Evaluation Committee (EC) was established to consider, in detail final
submissions and a methodology was designed to objectively
assess the best option
on a value for money basis. The EC assessed the Expression of Interest’s
short-listed seven buildings
and requested Final
on the responses received, ASIC had three options to consider:
a. Remain at 100 Market Street with a new 10-year lease;
b. Remain at 100 Market Street and exercise the 5-year option on the current

100 Market Street with a new 10-year lease and a reduced
Net Lettable Area
footprint as the preferred
2.17 ASIC determined that Option 2 - to remain at 100 Market Street and
exercise the 5- year option on the current lease should be
discounted as it only
allowed for ASIC to reduce their tenancy by one floor and would not achieve the
required savings across the
life of the
2.18 ASIC discounted Option 3 - to relocate to a new premise as Colliers
International identified that a key risk was the timing that
the new premises
would need to be completed and ASIC fully relocated by the 1st April
Scope of the works
2.19 The proposed ASIC fit out will be over part levels 5 and 6, and levels
7-10 at 100 Market Street, Sydney, and includes:
a. Supplementary air-conditioning in rooms with higher than normal cooling
and ventilation requirements
b. Lighting control system to reduce energy consumption in tenant areas
including the ability to automatically turn off lights in
unoccupied rooms and
to provide reduced lighting levels when appropriate
c. Data cabling throughout the tenant areas including data outlets at each
work point (designed to cater for future requirements)
d. Tenant fit out works to conform to ASIC’s operational requirements
including security (including door hardware and electronic
access control at
entrances and internal areas with higher than normal security needs)
e. Supplementation of the base building fire services where required
f. Office accommodation to meet ASIC’s Standard ABW (ASA) model,
including a general office fit out, open plan work areas, breakout
spaces, quiet
rooms and casual meeting spaces
g. Shared amenities, including kitchen hub areas, storage facilities, first
aid room, multi-use room and individually assigned lockers
h. A robust security system that protects ASIC information, people, assets
and operations, including secure areas to Zone 2 with card
readers on exit and
Zone 4, conforming with ASIO Technical
requirements
Staff consultation
2.20 At the public hearing ASIC told the Committee that in preparation for
the proposed works, it had consulted extensively with staff
in most offices over
the past 5 years to ensure consistency and ensure it had a good understanding of
what activities staff were
undertaking, what type of work environment and
technology was required to enable to staff to complete their work
effectively.
2.21 ASIC stated that ‘specialist and key stakeholder teams in Sydney
have been consulted to determine specific requirements
for areas such as the
Commission, Evidence Services, the Information Resource Centre, and
2.22 In addition, ASIC noted in their submission that ‘a Sydney
Stakeholder team has been established including local representatives
team, as a communication point for staff on the ABW implementation, to consider
and develop etiquettes for the space, and
assist with the change
2.23 ASIC stated that an intranet page has been established to provide staff
with updates ‘on ABW projects in their office,
including Sydney’.
ASIC noted that ‘regular all-staff emails and updates are posted to ensure
staff are kept abreast
of the project progress.’
2.24 At the public hearing the Committee asked ASIC what feedback had been
received by staff in other sites where ASIC’s ABW
model had been
established. ASIC told the Committee that the positive feedback focused largely
on the flexibility that the new workspace
provided and praised the technological
support provided by ASIC to support team based work. ASIC noted that some of the
project and the difficulties some staff were having adapting to
the new work
environment.
consultation
2.25 ASIC stated that ‘construction of the fit out will impact
positively on the local economy with employment in the private
ASIC estimate that during construction, ‘on average it is anticipated
there will be 50 people employed on site
for the 12-month period, with up to 100
people employed off-site during peak periods. It is estimated that up to 300
people will
work on various stages of the project through the design and
construction.’
2.26 At the public hearing the Committee asked ASIC about the impact of the
project on its current sublease with the Future Fund.
ASIC stated that:
When we went to the market we did a joint approach to market with the Future
Fund and Treasury as part of the Commonwealth's approach
to how they manage
property now. We've consulted with the Future Fund. The Future Fund will also
have their own separate tenancy
in 100 Market Street. Our meeting space on level
5 gets used by a number of Commonwealth agencies, and they will ensure that in
fit-out as well. We will have arrangements with them if they wish to use
our meeting rooms as well, in the public spaces, and get
better use out of
Cost of the works
2.27 Australian Securities & Investments Commission Proposed Fit out of
New Leased Premises at 100 Market Street, Sydney has an
estimated cost of $29.8
million, exclusive of GST.
2.28 ASIC provided further details on project costings in its confidential
submission and during an in-camera hearing.
2.29 The Committee is satisfied that the costings for the project provided to
it have been adequately assessed by the proponent entity.
2.30 The Committee was pleased to hear that the fit out will be fully funded
through ASIC’s Departmental Capital Works Budget
allocation, which will be
fully funded via the new lease incentive of approximately $34.4
2.31 ASIC stated in their submission that ‘the operating cost benefits
from the new fit out, through the increase flexibility
and utilisation of net
lettable area, and the reduction of costs of maintenance of the aging fit out
will also contribute to the
overall cost
2.32 There is no direct revenue from this project.
Committee comment
2.33 The Committee recognises the effort made by ASIC to engage with staff
and reiterates that changes to working environments need
to be carefully
undertaken to ensure minimal impact to staff. The Committee encourages ASIC to
continue to seek feedback from staff
and to ensure that staff remain informed
and engaged throughout the transition to the new working environment.
2.34 The Committee recognises the Australian Government’s Office
occupancy target of 14 meters square of usable office area
per occupied
work-point and notes that ASIC is proposing a target of 11.6 meters squared for
this project, a reduction of 4.7 meters
squared on the current fit
The Committee encourages
ASIC to ensure that the final design provides staff with adequate space and
amenities in which to comfortably
conduct their work.
2.35 The Committee is concerned that ASIC considers the current fit out at
100 Market Street as having reached its end-of-life whilst
only being 10 years
The Committee encourages
ASIC to reutilise as many elements of the current fit out as practically
feasible and to consider a longer
life span in the design for the proposed fit
2.36 Having regard to its role and responsibilities contained in the
Works Committee Act 1969
, the Committee is of the view that this project
signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project which
fit for purpose, having regard to the established need.
Recommendation 1
2.37 The Committee recommends that the House of Representatives resolve,
pursuant to
Section 18(7)
Public Works Committee Act 1969
is expedient to carry out the following proposed works: Australian Securities
& Investments Commission Proposed Fit
Out of New Leased Premises at 100
Market Street, Sydney
2.38 Proponent entities must notify the Committee of any changes to the
project scope, time, cost, function or design. The Committee
also requires that
a post-implementation report be provided within three months of project
completion. A report template can be found
on the Committee’s website.
3. Australia Taxation Office, Integrated Fitout of
New Leased Premises, 152 Wharf Street, Brisbane, QLD
3.1 The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) seeks approval from the Committee to
proceed with the proposed integrated fit out of new
leased premises at 152 Wharf
Street, Brisbane, Queensland. The aim of the project is to improve occupational
density in line with
government targets, provide a fit for purpose, flexible
workspace that can respond to the changing needs of the ATO business with
minimal cost and disruption, and an improved efficient building design that
reduces operational costs into the
3.2 The estimated cost of the project is $49.59 million (excluding GST).
3.3 The project was referred to the Committee on 27 November 2019.
Conduct of the
3.4 Following referral, the inquiry was publicised on the Committee’s
website and via media release.
3.5 The Committee received one submission and one confidential submission. A
list of submissions can be found at Appendix A.
3.6 On 26 February 2020, the Committee conducted a project briefing, public
and in-camera hearing in Canberra, Australian Capital
Territory. A transcript of
the public hearing is available on the Committee’s website.
Need for the works
3.7 The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is the principal revenue collection
agency of the Australian Government. Its role is to effectively
manage and shape
the tax and superannuation systems that support and fund services for
Australians.
3.8 Currently the ATO leases four sites in the Brisbane area, ‘one at
Chermside, one at Upper Mount Gravatt and two in the Brisbane
CBD, one of which
is fully sub-leased’.
ATO told the Committee that that project will facilitate the exit of the
ATO’s current Chermside accommodation, due to
expire in February
3.9 The ATO stated in their inquiry submission that:
In order to deliver the required fit for purpose high quality office
accommodation that meets the professional needs of employees
and the nature of
the employees’ work, the ATO needs to deliver a fit out of 17,867 meters
squared in the building being constructed
at 152 Wharf
ATO note that ‘the space being fitted out in the new building being
constructed at 152 Wharf Street exceeds the square
meterage in the existing
lease at Chermside’, however, the additional space will be used to provide
relief for the high demand
for accommodation at the existing 55 Elizabeth Street
3.11 At the public hearing the ATO told the Committee that currently there
were 1,228 staff at the Elizabeth Street site and the ATO
was planning on
accommodating 1,150 staff at the proposed Wharf Street
3.12 When asked by the Committee if the ATO planned to consolidate staff from
Elizabeth street into the proposed Wharf Street site
the ATO stated:
We have a lease already on our Elizabeth Street building in Brisbane. That lease
doesn't expire until 2028, so financially it wouldn't
be the most cost-effective
for government if we actually broke the lease. There's a whole range of issues
that come with that, so
we aren't able to do
ATO further stated that it was a possibility that the Elizabeth Street site may
be consolidated into the Wharf Street site
in the future, however this was
dependent on ‘what happens when our leases come up for
Options considered
3.14 The ATO stated in their submission that it has ‘engaged the
expertise of external consultants, including a Project Manager
and architectural
design team, to work with business to establish the user requirements for the
design of the fit out and to provide
a fit for purpose design that meets ATO
guidelines, Commonwealth property requirements and the ATO’s vision and
3.15 The ATO noted it their submission that their recent ‘experience
delivering fit out projects at their Gosford and Docklands
sites supports the
benefits of open plan, flexible work environments,’ which the ATO attests
has ‘provided the ATO with
improved flexibility to adapt to changing
operational requirements that easily respond to new ways of
3.16 The ATO also noted that ‘post occupancy reports and staff feedback
following these fit out projects has confirmed the flexible
fit out design as a
suitable option for a majority of business areas in the ATO’.
3.17 At the public hearing the ATO stated that:
The building at 152 Wharf Street is centrally located, close to public
transport, childcare services, retail and shopping amenities,
and employment and
education institutions. The location enables the ATO to leverage, source and
maintain a high-quality workforce;
and partner with tertiary
institutions.
the public hearing the ATO told the Committee that despite going out to market
in 2017 ‘we weren't able to source accommodation
that met our requirements
within the Chermside region, and we had no further options on the lease that we
had with Chermside.’
Therefore, the ATO planned to close its Chermside
site and [was] relocating those staff to the proposed Wharf Street
3.19 Additionally, the ATO told the Committee that it was
‘consolidating [it’s] information technology and data people
at other buildings in the Brisbane region into this new Wharf Street
Scope of the works
3.20 At the public hearing the ATO told the Committee that:
The building at 152 Wharf Street is a 24-level commercial tower, and the ATO
proposal is to fit out 14 floors. This fit-out will
provide an occupational
density rate that meets the Department of Finance target of 14 square metres per
person... The fit-out will
include a range of workspaces, including a mix of
traditional, agile and unallocated workstations. Meeting rooms,
videoconferencing
and other corporate rooms will be available, along with a
range of new spaces such as informal collaboration and meeting room areas
will be supported by mobile
technology.
ATO note in their submission that the fit out concept is for a contemporary
open-plan office space and includes:
§ Professional, contemporary, ‘Grade A’ office accommodation
which meets government occupational density targets
and offers large and
efficient floor plates, maximising space and future flexibility
§ A flexible and adaptable work environment in order to cope with
ongoing changes in business operation and technology
§ Modular work points that can be easily and quickly reconfigured
§ Collaboration, offices and meeting areas that are flexible and
designed for future reconfiguration
§ A robust security system that protects ATO information, people, other
assets and operations
§ Enhanced conference, training and video conference facilities to
support contemporary work practices
§ IT infrastructure which will support the needs of the site
§ First aid room and amenities areas
§ Contemporary end of trip facilities to support staff wellbeing
including showers, lockers and secure bike storage
§ Interconnecting stairs between floors to promote connectivity and
wellbeing in the workplace
3.22 In their submission, the ATO stated that the proposed fit-out will
‘meet all applicable codes and standard, including access
requirements and
provision of services’, including wheelchair access, lift arrangements,
toilet and shower
facilities.
Staff consultation
3.23 The ATO stated that it would follow a staff engagement and design
process ‘where each business area will make a decision
on the appropriate
design for their workforce. The design team will assess the information captured
and make a recommendation to
the ATO on the fit out design direction that is
best suited to proceed to detailed
3.24 The ATO stated that staff will be engaged on the design of the fit out
§ Obtaining team specific requirements such as team sizes, storage, use
of corporate facilities, team specific equipment requirements
§ Attending information and Q&A sessions about the design
§ Distribution of staff surveys to seek input and feedback on individual
preferences that could be considered
§ Discussing and seeking input (or even voting) on themes and colours
for the building
3.25 The ATO also stated that ‘the fit out will be designed to suit the
workforce occupying the building which is achieved through
the establishment of
a Site Working Group. Members of this group include nominated business line
representatives, site leaders, site
executives, union representatives and other
specialty group representatives (e.g. Work Health and Safety, Environmental
3.26 At the public hearing the ATO stated that with regards to involving
staff in the design process:
We haven't put together what the layout or the workspaces will look like in this
building, because we need to go and consult with
our staff to understand what
they want, and then, obviously, we do a detailed consultation process with them.
What we are offering
is three different types of workspace within this building.
We're looking at the allocated, the unallocated and the agile workspace.
the feedback that we've got generally from our staff that are looking to move
into Wharf Street. But, obviously, once it goes
through the Public Works
Committee, we'd be looking at then doing that detailed engagement and
consultation with our staff to understand
what the workspaces and fit-out will
ATO stated that the project imposes ‘no change to jobs or functions
undertaken in the Brisbane region and continues
to support the development and
maintenance of a skilled and professional
workforce’.
consultation
3.28 The ATO stated in their submission that the project at 152 Wharf Street
would benefit the local community as it:
§ Is it the most cost-effective option for the Commonwealth
§ Creates jobs during construction and fit out works
§ Supports local trades and services through ongoing maintenance and
supply requirements
§ Supports local businesses which will be frequented by ATO employees
and visitors to the Brisbane building
§ Makes use of existing public transport facilities
§ Strengthens an important link with tertiary campuses in the
3.29 At the public hearing the ATO told the Committee that:
On all of our property projects the ATO has been committed to maintaining its
strong track record of engagement with the Indigenous
and local business sector.
The ATO actively promotes and facilitates engagement of Indigenous business and
local business. In the
first six months of this financial year we've invested
$20 million in contracts with Indigenous business. Our commercial partnerships
are supporting sustainable benefits through Indigenous employment, business
growth and community investment...We will promote the
engagement of Indigenous
businesses and local businesses for 152 Wharf
Cost of the works
3.30 Australian Taxation Office, Integrated Fit out of New Leased Premises,
152 Wharf Street, Brisbane, Queensland has an estimated
cost of $49.59 million,
exclusive of GST.
3.31 ATO provided further details on project costings in its confidential
submission and during an in-camera hearing.
3.32 The Committee is satisfied that the costings for the project provided to
it have been adequately assessed by the proponent entity.
3.33 The Committee was pleased to hear that the ATO will fund the fit out
within existing departmental capital
3.34 At the public hearing the ATO told the Committee that:
The proposed fit-out maximises value for money, as it enables the ATO to improve
occupational density, provide a fit-for-purpose,
flexible workspace that can
respond to the changing needs of the ATO with minimal cost and disruption, and
provide an approved, efficient
building design that reduces operational costs
3.35 There will be no direct revenue generated by the
Committee comment
3.36 In relation to the staff consultation process, the Committee was pleased
to hear that ATO business areas would be given the opportunity
to feed into the
design for their workforce based on their specific needs. The Committee
encourages ATO to continue to engage openly
with staff throughout the project to
ensure that staff are adequately informed and accommodated.
3.37 The Committee was concerned about the impact that having to relocate
from Chermside to Brisbane city centre would have on staff
with regards to
increased commute times, access to parking and public transport. The Committee
encourages the ATO to continue to
seek feedback from staff and to ensure that
all staff concerns are adequately addressed.
3.38 The ATO informed the Committee that design of the proposed
interconnected circular stairs were a health and wellbeing opportunity
staff, as they were more appealing that the concrete fire stairs. While the
Committee acknowledges the health and wellbeing benefits,
the high per square
meter cost of the proposed staircase was of concern to the Committee. The
Committee encourages the ATO to consider
a final stair case design with a lower
cost per square meter.
3.39 The Committee notes that the current
Elizabeth Street office could potentially be consolidated into the Wharf Street
the future and encourages the ATO to consider this solution should the
opportunity arise.
3.40 The outlining of
the process used by the ATO to identify the Wharf Street site for the works,
highlighted a number of concerns
to the Committee. This is outside the remit of
the Committee’s scrutiny, however, the Committee considers the process to
of sufficient concern that the Australian National Audit Office should
consider investigating the process of site selection for the
Wharf Street
Recommendation 2
3.41 The Committee recommends that the Auditor-General considers
conducting an audit into the process undertaken by the Australian
Office in identifying and selecting 152 Wharf Street as the preferred site for
3.42 Having regard to its role and
responsibilities contained in the
Public Works Committee Act 1969
, and bearing
in mind the current lease expiry date, the Committee is of the view that this
project is fit for purpose, having regard
to the established need.
Recommendation 3
3.43 The Committee recommends that the House of Representatives resolve,
pursuant to
Section 18(7)
Public Works Committee Act 1969
is expedient to carry out the following proposed works: Australian Taxation
Office, Integrated Fit out of New Leased Premises,
152 Wharf Street, Brisbane,
Queensland.
3.44 Proponent entities must notify the Committee of any changes to the
project scope, time, cost, function or design. The Committee
also requires that
a post-implementation report be provided within three months of project
completion. A report template can be found
on the Committee’s website.
4. RAAF Base Tindal Stage 6 Redevelopment and United
States Force Posture Initiative Airfield Works
4.1 The Department of Defence (Defence) seeks approval from the Committee to
proceed with the RAAF Base Tindal Redevelopment Stage
6 and United States Force
Posture Initiatives Airfield Works, NT project. The project is comprised of two
key components:
§ Component 1 - RAAF Base Tindal Redevelopment Stage 6
§ Component 2 - United States Force Posture Initiatives RAAF Base Tindal
Airfield Works and Associated
Infrastructure.
4.2 Defence state that the aim of component 1 of the project is to
‘maintain the existing capability of the base by addressing
deficiencies and capacity constraints in existing facilities and infrastructure,
and to support growth in demand from
the increasing operational tempo’.
Component 1 also aims to address the risks associated with non-compliant
facilities and
to reduce ongoing operating costs by replacing under-utilised or
redundant facilities.
4.3 The aim of component 2 of the project is to ‘increase the capacity
of RAAF Base Tindal to support KC-30A Multi Role Tanker
Transport operations,
which are a key part of the core Air Power role of air mobility, in particular
air-to-air refuelling and air
logistics support missions’. Component 2
also aims to support the United States Force Posture Initiatives by improving
accessibility
to the RAAF Base for United States Air Force aircraft. Defence
note that ‘the United States Force Posture Initiatives is an
the Force Posture Agreement between the Australian and United States
Governments’.
4.4 The estimated cost of the project is $1,174.0 million (excluding
4.5 The project was referred to the Committee on 25 February 2020.
Conduct of the
4.6 Following referral, the inquiry was publicised on the Committee’s
website and via media release.
4.7 The Committee received four submissions, one supplementary submission and
one confidential submission. A list of submissions can
be found at Appendix
4.8 On 21 April 2020, the Committee conducted a project briefing, public and
in-camera hearing via teleconference. A transcript of
the public hearing is
available on the Committee’s website.
Need for the works
4.9 RAAF Base Tindal, located 15 km east southeast of Katherine in the
Norther Territory is an enduring Air Force base. Defence state
that as RAAF
Tindal is ‘the Air Force’s major operational base in Northern
Australia, it is critical to the employment
of Australia’s air combat
capability’.
4.10 Defence state in their submission that:
[RAAF Tindal] is the main operating base for No 75 Squadron, which will operate
the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter, and is a key forward
operating base for E-7
Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft. The Tindal base will
become a key forward operating
base for aircraft such as the MQ-4C Triton
Remotely Piloted Aircraft. The KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transport operating from
will carry out air-to-air refuelling operations and air logistics
4.11 Additionally,
Defence told the Committee that ‘The United States Air Force will also
conduct training from RAAF Base Tindal
under the Enhanced Air Cooperation
component of the United States Force Posture
Initiative.’
4.12 When asked by the Committee if Defence planned on submitted future
proposals for works at RAAF Base Tindal, Defence stated:
Not works that would then build on what we've done. There's no immediate one
that does staged redevelopment work as such. What you
will see from us in the
future, though, will be some air capability projects, but they are above and
beyond what we're doing here...[and]
other capabilities from Air Force—for
instance, unmanned aerial vehicles, which will require some of their own
facilities above
and beyond what we're
4.13 Defence
further stated that it was not likely that base development works or further
investment in the in-ground infrastructure
would be required for some time given
the investment for this
Options considered
4.14 Defence state in their submission that considered the following four
options for component 1 of the project:
§ Option 1: do nothing
§ Option 2: full scope
§ Option 3: in-budget scope
§ Option 4: highest priority
4.15 Defence state that option 1 was not a viable course of action as
‘it failed to address the risks to Defence capability
from ineffective,
non-compliant and inefficient operational and support facilities and engineering
infrastructure that underpin operations
at RAAF Base Tindal’.
Additionally, although option 2 ‘addressed the shortcomings of the
facilities identified as being
at the end of their service lives’ the
option was discounted as it was significantly over budget ad not
affordable.
4.16 Option 3 was also discounted as it ‘presented significant risks to
Defence capability’, therefore option 4 was selected
as the preferred
option as it ‘includes all additional scope to reduce the risks to Defence
to an acceptable level and is affordable
within the revised budget approved by
Government in December
4.17 With regards to component 2 of the project, Defence considered the
following three options:
§ Option 1: do nothing
§ Option 2: in-budget scope
§ Option 3: minimum capability scope
4.18 Defence state that option 1 of component 2 was deemed ‘not viable
as it failed to address the Australian Defence Force’s
requirements, it also did not meet Australia’s commitments under the Force
Posture Agreement’. Additionally,
option 2 was discounted as it
‘required unacceptable compromises in
capability’.
4.19 Option 3 was selected by Defence as the preferred option for component 2
as it ‘delivers the required minimum capability
improvements and is
affordable within the budget approved by Government in December
Scope of the works
4.20 The proposed scope of component 1 of the project includes:
Permanent Living In Accommodation:
‘Three buildings are
proposed which will provide 108 single occupancy units, including a number of
accessible units. Each room
will be 30 meters squared and will include an
ensuite, built-in fixtures such as wardrobes, cupboards and desk, furniture, and
be air conditioned. Each room will have a balcony or patio. Laundries will
be provided on a “one per four units” basis.
Covered car parking

to meet the relevant standards, including a 100-year design life.
distribution systems in each new building will be connected to the existing
water supply via a
Control and Reporting Unit Facilities:
This element includes
‘constructing two new technical equipment and communication buildings,
improving access to, and earthing
of, the fixed communications facility antenna
and replacing the existing antenna; and demolishing redundant buildings and
structures.’
Security Force Amenities Facilities:
These facilities
‘will be improved by reconfiguring the working accommodation areas,
refreshing some building services and
finishes and constructing a new amenities
annex that will comprise of toilets, showers, and change rooms. External works
will include
providing all-weather access to the kennels and quarantine
facilities, irrigating the exercise yards and constructing a sealed car
Visiting Squadron Facility
: ‘The proposed purpose-built
Visiting Squadron Facility will replace five transportable buildings to improve
the working conditions
for aircrew and maintenance personnel. The existing
equipment shelter and the storage facility will be retained and additional car
parking will be
4.21 The proposed scope for component 2 of the project includes:
Airfield Works:
The primary airfield upgrades involve extending
the runway by 2,000 feet to 11,000 feet (3,353 metres) and widening runway
from three metres to 10.5 metres and re-aligning, extending and
widening the parallel taxiway for heavy aircraft movements. Works
also include
constructing two new operational readiness platforms... upgrading an existing
secondary taxiway to accommodate larger
aircraft, constructing a new taxiway and
upgrading the airfield stormwater drainage system. The existing aeronautical
ground lighting
system will be re-configured to complement the proposed airfield
layout, and the existing navigation aids will be re-configured or
Aircraft Parking Apron
: The proposed aircraft parking apron
will be approximately 52,000 square metres to provide parking bays for four Code
E3 aircraft.
It will be situated to comply with the RAAF Base Tindal Flight Line
Master Plan. The apron pavements will be designed for heavy transport
movements and will be graded to the airfield stormwater network. Environmental
controls such as interceptor tanks will be
installed to capture any fuel spills.
Apron floodlighting will be installed to support night
operations.
Aviation Fuel Farm
: An aviation fuel farm is proposed, to
provide a total storage capacity of six mega litres. The two storage tanks will
steel, encased in concrete and earth-mounded for protection... The
proposed fuel farm includes a control centre and fuel quality
laboratory, tanker
loading and off-loading equipment, electrical and mechanical services buildings
and measures to protect the environment
from potential fuel spills. A hydrant
refuelling system, designed to support air mobility operations such as air to
air refuelling,
will service each of the four aircraft parking
Air Movements Terminal
: The proposed Air Movements Terminal has
been designed to enable a passenger handling capacity of 250 inbound or outbound
on domestic or international flights and a commensurate cargo handling
capacity. The proposed facility comprises an administration
area, a passenger
handling area and an area for receipting and despatching cargo. Departures and
arrivals areas will be separated.
Areas for the quarantine and border security
processing checks for international flights will also be
constructed.
Engineering Services and Infrastructure
: The existing
engineering services infrastructure will be extended to provide new electrical,
communications and hydraulics services
to the proposed Fuel Farm, the Air
Movements Terminal, aircraft parking apron, aeronautical ground lighting system
and navigation
4.22 Defence states in their submission that two ‘additional project
elements have been identified and approved by Government
for delivery that are
unfunded within the available capital provision. Should funds become available
within the budget, for example
through competitive tendering or retired risk
provisions, these will be allocated to the unfunded project
4.23 The unfunded project elements are related to component 2 of the
§ Aviation Fuel Farm - Demolish the old Fuel Farm, and replace the
refuelling truck parking at the new Fuel Farm
§ Engineering services and infrastructure - Re-align Civilian Terminal
access road
4.24 At the public hearing the Committee asked about the impact of the
COVID-19 travel restrictions on the works. Defence told the
Committee that:
We know that out-of-Northern Territory based subcontractors will no doubt be
awarded some of the work. What we're yet to test is
their ability to move from
whichever state they're in into the Northern Territory to see if there's any
need for them to be quarantined
for any period of time or not. We just don't
quite have certainty on that yet. Both my team and the managing contractor team
Lendlease and our project manager contract administrator in RPS are
carefully monitoring that. So at the moment we don't foresee
any significant
impact, but it is a bit hard to say how it will unfold with the movement of
contractors into the Northern Territory
and how the quarantine regime may impact
answer to a question on notice to the Committee, Defence stated that it
estimated that the managing contractor would require
an average of 46 staff per
years over seven and a half years to complete the works. Based on previous
experience, Defence expects
that most of these staff will come from outside the
Katherine area, however, the managing contractor MC expects local Katherine
will be engaged by either their direct subcontractors,
sub-subcontractors or suppliers on the project who will use local Katherine
based employees.
4.26 Defence further noted that ‘the managing contractor has and will
continue to actively encourage participation by local
Katherine businesses
through the conduct of Industry Briefings and through the project specific
Industry Capability Network NT site
for opportunities relating to the
consultation
4.27 In its submission to the Committee, Defence stated it had engaged with a
variety of internal and external stakeholders during
the project development
4.28 Defence stated in their submission that the project would benefit the
local community as:
There will be opportunities for indigenous business involvements in accordance
with the Indigenous Procurement Policy. Works to be
undertaken must comply with
the Government Policy for Local Industry Participation, which requires
successful tenderers to provide
detailed commitments on how they will utilise
and develop Australian
the public hearing Defence told the Committee that:
From the start of the project when Lendlease became the MC approximately two
years ago, we started engagement with community groups
such as Master Builders
NT, the chamber of commerce and ICN NT particularly to understand opportunities
for the market. We've also
been talking to government and we've developed a
procurement strategy which we think will provide maximum opportunity to the
Lendlease work with ICN for our industry presentations that we
undertook on procurement late last year, both in Darwin and Katherine,
they were very well attended. There were approximately 300 in Darwin and 60
persons in Katherine. What the project is doing
is making it easier by following
proven paths for local businesses to be involved in the
Committee received two letters of support for the project from the Australian
Industry and Defence Network – NT, and
the Northern Territory
Government.
Cost of the works
4.31 RAAF Base Tindal Redevelopment Stage 6 and United States Force Posture
Initiatives Airfield Works, NT has an estimated cost of
$1,174.0 million,
exclusive of GST.
4.32 Defence provided further details on project costings in its confidential
submission and during an in-camera hearing.
4.33 The Committee is satisfied that the costings for the project provided to
it have been adequately assessed by the proponent entity.
4.34 There will be no direct revenue generated by the
Committee comment
4.35 The Public Works Committee acknowledges the critical role that RAAF Base
Tindal plays in supporting Australia’s air combat
capability and
recognises the need for this program of works in order to support KC-30A Multi
Role Tanker Transport operations in
4.36 The Committee recognises the important role that large scale Defence
projects such as the proposed works at RAAF Base Tindal
play in creating job
opportunities and advancing local industry in regional areas throughout
4.37 The Committee was pleased to hear that the managing contractor,
Lendlease, had been engaging with the Industry Capability Network
Northern Territory to make sure that local industry was aware of the
opportunities surround this project and given the opportunity
4.38 The Committee did not identify any issues of concern with the proposal
and is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of
need, scope and
4.39 Having regard to its role and responsibilities contained in the
Works Committee Act 1969
, the Committee is of the view that this project
signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project which
fit for purpose, having regard to the established need.
