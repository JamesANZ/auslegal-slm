Complainant AH v The Department [2007] VPrivCmr 3 (29 November 2007)
Complainant AH v The Department
[2007] VPrivCmr
Disclosure of personal information
allegation that the
Department disclosed personal information unrelated to an investigation being
undertaken. Data security
– allegation that the Department
failed to take reasonable steps to secure the personal information from
unauthorised disclosure.
The Complaint
2007 VPrivCmr 3
The Complainant lived in a small country
town and had been employed with the Department with many years of exemplary
service. He became
ill and was obliged to take leave from work. Shortly before
commencing leave, an allegation was made against the Complainant that
inappropriately used a departmental vehicle.
In investigating the allegation, the Department’s representative
visited the small country town and stayed with a friend who
had also worked with
the Department. At dinner with other local people, it was alleged that the
Department’s representative
disclosed details about the purpose of his
visit, namely to investigate a serving staff member currently on sick leave.
the Complainant’s name was not specifically mentioned, the
Complainant believed that enough information was disclosed (within
rural community) to enable his identity to be reasonably ascertained and
therefore amounted to a disclosure of the Complainant’s
information. The Complainant also believed that by disclosing information about
him, the Department failed to take adequate
steps to secure his personal
information from misuse and loss, unauthorised access, or disclosure.
The complaint was referred to conciliation where the Department acknowledged
that information discussed by its representative could
have amounted to a
disclosure of personal information in the particular context. The Department
further acknowledged the Complainant’s
exemplary employment history, lack
of substance to the allegations made about him, and feelings of humiliation,
embarrassment and
hurt as a result of its representative’s disclosure.
To resolve the matter, the Complainant sought both an amount of compensation
and to have his reputation restored within his small
rural community.
The complaint was conciliated on the following terms:
Compensation of
$5,000 plus an additional $400 for expenses incurred in making the complaint and
attending the conciliation meeting;
The Department
hosting an event with media presence in the Complainant’s town to publicly
acknowledge his exemplary employment
The Complainant
to be presented with a Certificate of Service at the event.
The conciliation agreement demonstrates the effectiveness of non-financial
outcomes to redress the complainant’s feelings of
embarrassment and
humiliation.
