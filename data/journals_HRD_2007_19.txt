On 25-26 November 2006, five UNSW law students
selected by the Australian Human Rights Centre (‘AHRC’) travelled to
Chengdu, China, to take part in the Chinese National
Model UN Conference.
The Conference was sponsored by the Australian Agency for International
Development and the participation of the students was arranged
by the Australian
Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission’s (‘HREOC’)
Human Rights Technical Cooperation
Program (‘Program’). This Program
coordinates a number of different projects relating to human rights issues
capacity-building, consultation with government agencies and promoting
human rights education. The Program has a longstanding relationship
United Nations Association of China, which requested the participation of an
Australian team in the 2006 annual conference.
HREOC approached the AHRC to
organise a student team from the UNSW Law School to take part in the Conference.
The annual Conference brings together university students from all over China
to take part in the simulation of a particular UN body.
The conference was held
at Sichuan University in Chengdu, Sichuan province in Central China. This
location enabled the participation
of students from the remote western provinces
of China, many of whom travelled over 40 hours by train to be there. Students
35 universities throughout China, including many of the most prestigious,
attended the conference.
The 2006 Conference sought to simulate the recently formed United Nations
Human Rights Council. At the Conference, students from each
represented a country currently represented in the Human Rights Council. The
conference consisted of two committees, each
of which addressed broad issues
within international human rights law. The first committee looked at the topic
International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural
: Ideals vs Reality’. The second committee looked at ‘the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
: Progress Made and
Challenges Ahead’.
While the Conference did not begin until the Saturday, lobbying began on the
Friday night with, at one stage, over 30 students crammed
‘Brazilian’ delegates’ bedroom putting forward their
positions. This set the tone for the Conference,
demonstrating the eagerness of
students to engage with the issues and to learn the processes of diplomacy
recreated in the Conference.
While students had prepared detailed position
papers and formal speeches for the countries they represented, most of the
negotiation took place

of human rights issues and an intimacy with the procedural
rules of the Council.
in frenzies of activity between sessions, a contrast
to the formality of the official sessions. Nevertheless, progress was slow as,
despite the conference simulating an organisation designed to remove the voting
blocs of the old Human Rights Commission, strong
blocs were formed in each
committee. The first day of the Conference continued until 11pm. It was only
after some cross-cultural
karaoke that members could reconcile their differences
and come together on the Sunday to hammer out two comprehensive resolutions
each committee.
Participating students demonstrated a profound awareness of a multitude of
human rights issues and an intimacy with the procedural
rules of the Council.
Students genuinely enjoyed the opportunity to take part in the process and
certainly learnt a great deal from
their participation. The Conference brought
students together from all over the country, helping to forge friendships and
between students from some of China’s most prestigious
universities and students from universities in remote provinces from
China. The increased awareness of the process of political negotiation and
decision-making students gained from their participation
in the Conference was
no doubt empowering. The opportunity to engage with human rights issues from the
perspective of another country
also proved a powerful means of breaking out of
culturally determined views on human rights and a way to better appreciate more
the difficulties and subtleties involved in international diplomacy.
The Conference was not only an enjoyable experience in itself but it is clear
that such conferences have lasting impacts on participants.
At a lunch with the
UNSW students on the Sunday, Conference organiser, Qing Kaixong spoke
passionately about the increasing neglect
of public health issues and facilities
in China. At that moment it seemed clear that Qing may go on to become a leader
Chinese human rights movements. Events like the conference undoubtedly
is a positive sign.
Their opportunity to engage seriously with human rights issues is limited. When
we met later with students from
Peking University who had participated in the
Conference, they told us that the events at Tiananmen Square still have a strong
on students’ willingness to engage with political issues,
particularly human rights.
The conference also had a significant impact on the UNSW students that
attended. The chance to meet Chinese students, and learn about
their life in
China was revealing for both the similarities and their differences. It was
surprising how easily the UNSW students
formed relationships with students from
the other universities. The opportunity to hear about human rights issues from
their point
of view was enlightening. It was refreshing to hear about economic
and social rights in concrete terminology rather than in the politicised
left-right dialogue that we commonly invoke in debating rights. This
demonstrated how culturally influenced our perceptions of human
rights are,
making the Conference all the more important for its role in bringing together
people with vastly different, but equally
legitimate, perspectives. In contrast,
many Chinese students showed limited understanding of human rights principles we
to be fundamental, such as freedom of speech. This demonstrated the
underlying tenuousness of many rights that are often taken for
Australia and the need for ongoing reinforcement of the role of those rights in
our culture. This was driven home on our
UNSW delegates was prevented from being interviewed about the experience as it
was deemed too
political by a Sydney community radio station.
All participants found the experience richly rewarding for the insights
gained about human rights, UN processes, Chinese culture and
politics and for
the friendship formed. We hope that there will be further opportunity for
students to participate in the future.
