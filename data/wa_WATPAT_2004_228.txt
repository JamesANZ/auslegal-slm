The Tribunal:
Introduction
1. This appeal arises from the deemed refusal of the Respondent of an
application for planning consent for the alteration and addition
of an existing
building, including the incorporation of consulting rooms. The Respondent failed
to deal with the application within
the time prescribed by clause 86(a) of the
Respondent’s Town Planning Scheme No.3 (“
the application is therefore deemed refused.
2. These reasons for decision are concerned with a preliminary issue as to the
ownership of part of the land the subject of the application
for planning
consent. At the hearing of the preliminary issue, it was made clear that if the
Tribunal answers in the affirmative
in relation to the questions posed, that the
Respondent would consent to the granting of the development approval.
3. In order to give the preliminary issue context, it is necessary to outline
briefly the development proposed, and the land upon
which this development is to
take place.
4. The proposed development which gives rise to the appeal is the extension and
alteration of an existing house. This component of
the development is on land
owned by the Appellant in freehold at 45 Quarry Street Fremantle, the whole of
the land in Certificate
of Title 1476, Folio 140, being Lot 13 on Plan 1404.
5. In addition, other physical works are proposed, including the provision of
drainage, the construction of a brick pillar, and resurfacing
of an area that is
to be used for the purpose of a car parking space, on land which is not in
ownership of the Appellant. It is this
component of the development which gives
rise to the preliminary point.
6. The land in question is a right of way (“
”), which runs
along the north-eastern side boundary of Lot 13, and wraps around the rear of
the lot. The ROW appears to have
been provided as part of the original
subdivision of the land on Plan 1404.
7. The application form for planning consent was signed only by the Appellant.
The Respondent did not deal with the application on
the basis that the ROW was
not in the ownership of the Appellant, and the true owner had not signed the
application form. Therefore,
as noted above, the appeal comes to the Tribunal as
a deemed refusal.
Preliminary Issue
8. The questions put to the Tribunal by the Appellant for determination
(a) Whether the ROW is subject to the care, control and management of the
Respondent; and
(b) If the answer to this question is in the affirmative, whether the Respondent
can consent to the making of the Development Application
the subject of these
proceedings in respect of the ROW as an owner of that
9. It should be said at the outset that as drafted, these preliminary questions
appear to require the Tribunal to give an advisory
opinion. It is clear that the
Tribunal has no such power.
10. The scope of the Tribunal’s power to determine appeals is
circumscribed by section 50 of the
Town Planning and Development Act
. The ultimate orders that may be made are set out in section 50(1), and
include the power to affirm, vary, and set aside determinations
already made.
11. Section 50(2) provides:
“The Tribunal may also make any
incidental or ancillary orders.”
12. In the decision of
Bonton Pty Ltd v City of South Perth
(Appeal No. 2
of 1981, published 21 August 1981), the Tribunal, then under the
chairmanship of the present Chief Justice, dealt
the validity of an
amendment to the City of South Perth’s scheme. He made the following
observation:
“In our view, the Tribunal has a duty to
decide an appeal within its jurisdiction in accordance with law.
In order to
do so it must identify and decide any relevant question of law, the decision of
which is necessary for the determination
of the appeal.
Because the
appeals, section 50(3) does not confer on
the Tribunal the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court to make binding declarations of law.” (emphasis added).
13. It is clear to me that both the wording in section 50(2) and the comments
made by Tribunal in
require any incidental or ancillary order to
be necessary for the final disposition of the matter. It is my view, for reasons
follow these questions as currently drafted are not necessary for the
determination of the appeal, and should not therefore be
entertained.
Competency of Appeal
14. The answers to the questions as posed are unnecessary for the determination
of the appeal in the absence of confirmation as to
whether the signatures of the
owners of the land are required at all.
15. The starting point must be whether the application itself is procedurally
complete, and that all requirements which may affect
the competence of the
application (and therefore the appeal) have been complied with.
16. Unlike many town planning schemes TPS3 does not impose a requirement that
applications for planning consent be signed by the
owner of the land in
question. Clause 78 is in the following terms:
person is required to obtain the Council’s consent an application shall be
made in writing in a form specified
by Council.”
17. The form itself does not form part of TPS3, nor any other of the
Respondent’s regulations or policies. The form that is
“specified” (although the means of specification are unknown)
includes an advice note which provides:
“The signature of
the landowner(s) is required for all applications. This application will not
proceed without all signatures.”
18. The question for the Tribunal, therefore, is whether the absence of a
signature in this case is relevant to the competence of
the appeal, and the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Whether the signatures of
owners are required for an appeal
to be competent has been dealt with in
previously by the Western Australian Supreme Court in
Pacesetter Homes Pty
Ltd and Anor v State Planning Commission
(1993) 84 LGERA 71
recently in this Tribunal by
Australian Real Estate Investment Ltd v Western
Australian Planning Commission; Australian Real Estate Investment Ltd v City of
[2003] WATPAT 24
Water Corporation v City of Gosnells
[2004] WATPAT 169.
19. This of course is not the question that has been posed by the Appellant, and
therefore does not fall to be determined.
20. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to answer the
questions posed by the Appellant, and the matter is
listed for a directions
hearing at 9:30am on Friday 4 February 2005 for further directions to be made
for the disposition of this
