Carer Allowance: qualification; carer and care receiver not living in the
same house; whether 'care and attention' needs to be provided
STEWART and SECRETARY to the DEEWR
(2012/3854)
Decided: 13th September 2013 by B.J McCabe
Stewart lived and worked in Brisbane. Her mother lived in her own home in Mt
Tamborine, and required significant care on the basis
of her disabilities.
Stewart travelled to her mother’s home several times during the week to
provide this care, and sometimes
stayed overnight in her mother’s home. On
the days that Stewart could not be with her mother, she would telephone her to
her to take her medication and about other important tasks, and to check
in with her.
Stewart applied for Carer Allowance in respect of the care she provided her
mother. This claim was rejected by the Secretary. The
SSAT affirmed the
decision, and Stewart appealed to the AAT.
Legislation
Section 954A
Social Security Act 1991
(‘the Act’)
sets out the qualification criteria for carer allowance, where the carer and
care receiver do not live in
the same home. The decision in this matter centred
on whether Stewart met the ‘care and attention’ requirements in
(2) The care and attention:
(a) must address special care needs:
(i) that the care receiver is assessed under the Adult Disability Assessment
Tool as having; and
(ii) that relate to the care receiver’s bodily functions or to
sustaining the care receiver’s life; and
(b) must be received by the care receiver on a daily basis, for a total of at
least 20 hours a week; and
(i) be received by the care receiver from the person alone; or
(ii) be received by the care receiver from the person together with another
person whose work in providing the care and attention
is not on wages that are
at or above the wages mentioned in paragraph (1)(f), whether or not both persons
are present every day when
the care receiver receives the care and attention;
(d) must be received in a private home that is the residence of the care
receiver, the person or the other person (if any), but not
the residence of both
the care receiver and the person; and
(e) must not be care and attention of a kind (if any) specified, by
legislative instrument, by the Secretary for the purposes of this
Stewart’s application for carer allowance was rejected by the original
decisionmaker on the basis that she did not satisfy the
requirement in
s.954A(2)(b).
This requirement is that the care ‘must be received by the
care receiver on a daily basis, for a total of at least 20 hours
Stewart gave evidence that she spent more than 20 hours a week providing care
for her mother in her mother’s home. She also
explained that she was in
her mother’s home 3 or 4 days in an average week, but 5 to 6 days in other
weeks. On a day that she
was not physically present in her mother’s home,
Stewart would
call her mother at least once, in order to remind her to take her medication
and to check that she had performed self-care tasks.
On these days respite
carers visited
her mother to provide her with face-to-face care.
Stewart argued that there was nothing in the Act to say that ‘care and
attention' could not be provided by telephone. She argued
that the care provided
over the telephone, together with the care provided in her mother’s home,
meant that she was providing
care ‘on a daily basis’.
The Secretary did not agree with the submissions that the telephone care
could be taken into account. The Secretary referred to
s.954A(2)(d)
which requires that the care ‘must be received in a private home that is
the residence of the care receiver, the
person or the other person (if any), but
not the residence of both the care receiver and the person’. Reference was
Explanatory Memorandum to the
Family and Community Services
and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Budget Measures) Bill
, which introduced the qualification criteria for care situations where
the care receiver and carer did not live together.
The Explanatory Memorandum made the following statement in relation to
s.954A(2)(d):
...the carer may go to the care receiver’s home to provide care, or the
care receiver may go to the carer’s home to receive
The Secretary argued that the reference that the carer must ‘go to the
care receiver’s home’ indicated the legislative
intention that the
care must be provided on a face-to-face basis. The Tribunal expressed the
opinion that the focus on s.954A(2)(d)
was misconceived, as the purpose of that
paragraph was to confirm that there was no co-residency requirement. The
Tribunal stated
that regard must first be paid to s.954A(2)(a), which defines
the type of ‘care and attention’ that must be provided,
moving on to decide where this ‘care and attention’ was provided.
Paragraph (2)(a) states:
(2) The care and attention:
(a) must address special care needs:
(i) that the care receiver is assessed under the Adult Disability Assessment
Tool as having; and
(ii) that relate to the care receiver’s bodily functions or to
sustaining the care receiver’s life
The Tribunal did not make a determination about Stewart’s
mother’s assessment under the Adult Disability Assessment Tool.
relation to paragraph (2)(a)(ii) the Tribunal stated:
The sort of care contemplated by the parliament in that provision is
ordinarily provided on a face-to-face basis. Care that addresses
functions cannot be provided remotely. These are “hands on” tasks.
Providing telephone reminders about taking
medication is unlikely to fall within
the range of activities contemplated by the sub-section, even where taking
medication is itself
necessary to sustain life. Simply stated, you have to be
there in order to satisfy the requirements of the section. [Reasons for
decision, para. 9].
On this basis the Tribunal decided that Stewart was not providing
‘daily’ care and attention to her mother, and did not
carer allowance. The Tribunal did not make any observations about the second
part of paragraph (2)(a)(ii), which refers
to ‘sustaining the care
receiver’s life’, and whether care provided other than on a
face-to-face basis could satisfy
this requirement.
Formal decision
The Tribunal affirmed the decision under review.
