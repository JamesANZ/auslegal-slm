Love train?
Commuters' perceptions of train services in Melbourne
Amirthalingam Thevathasan, Balasingham Balachandran
Amirthalingam Thevathasan and Balasingham Balachandranlook at commuters’ perceptions of train services in Melbourne.
What do Melbourne commuters really think about their metropolitan train service? This study looks at safety, comfort, service delivery,
facilities, staff impact, ticketing and information and finds that satisfaction in the quality of service was lower during 2004–2006
than during 1998–2003. Customer perceptions must be taken into account when making decisions which have an impact on passenger
services. Customer satisfaction in relation to crowding on trains or waiting times wasn’t examined in this analysis so further
study is warranted to make more informed decisions about upgrading or improving the rail network.
Description of the Sample
Who was asked for feedback on their travel experience?
Average Ratings for Train Service Attributes
Average ratings for questions related to service delivery, facilities and value for money have declined over the years whereas average
ratings for safety issues have improved. Improving service delivery and facilities will enhance the perception of value for money.

Conclusions
Improvement on safety-related aspects and other aspects ranked lower by the commuters will help to improve the perception on
overall satisfaction on the quality of the train service.
While there is no significant difference in satisfaction between males and females, we did find that satisfaction is stronger
for youngest and oldest age groups than other age groups. Satisfaction is low for regular travellers and least frequent travellers
while passengers who travel during peak time on weekdays showed significantly lower satisfaction also. Overall satisfaction is significantly
lower during the period 2004–2006 than 1998–2003.
Although the majority of the responses hover between 4.5-5.5, (7 being the highest) respondents were still seeking improvement
in service delivery and facilities.
