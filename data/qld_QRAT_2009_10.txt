Carrigg v Queensland Racing [2009] QRAT 10 (26 May 2009)
RACING APPEALS
NOTICE OF DECISION
26 May 2009
Donna Louise Carrigg
RESPONDENT:
Queensland Racing
APPEARANCES:
Mr Mark Plunket, barrister instructed by Terry Fisher & Associates for
the appellant Donna Louise Carrigg and Allison Finlay on
behalf of the
respondent Queensland Racing
Mr Leo Williams AO – Chairman
Mr Brockwell Miller – Deputy
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
The appellant is a licensed jockey who on Monday 20 April 2009 provided a
urine sample which upon testing proved positive to a banned
substance. By
letter dated 1 May 2009 Queensland Racing advised the appellant that she was
charged with two counts of breaching
Australian Rule of Racing 81A(1)(a) which
Any rider commits an offence and may be penalised if –
(a) A sample taken from him (sic) is found upon analysis to contain the
substance banned by AR.81B.
There is an identification of the specifics of the first charge and then of
the second charge. Suffice to say that the two charges
levelled against
Ms Carrigg arise out of ingestion of the same substance one being relative
to a metabolyte of the other banned substance.
It is not therefore proper in
the opinion of this Tribunal for two charges to have been levelled as that will
reflect poorly on
the record of the appellant in the future. It is therefore
necessary to identify that there should only have been one charge. A
penalty was imposed by the Chairman of the Inquiry Mr Michael Halliday. He was
correct in his identification that there
should only be one penalty and it is
perhaps appropriate that the record be amended to reflect that there should only
have been one
The appeal is against penalty only in respect to this charge and against a
further charge under Rule 175(q). The Notice of Appeal
referred only to Rule
175(q). During the course of this appeal Mr Plunket for the appellant
sought leave which was granted by this
Tribunal to appeal also against the
severity of the penalty imposed under AR81A(1)(a).
The Tribunal is of the opinion that a period of six months disqualification
imposed in respect to the offence against Rule 81A(1)(a)
is appropriate and
proper in all the circumstances has referred to all of the precedents that have
come before this Tribunal relative
to the ingestion of the banned substance. It
is the Order of this Tribunal that the appeal against the severity of sentence
respect be dismissed.
The appellant was convicted of the charge under Rule 175(q) and in that
respect a penalty was imposed of 12 months disqualification.
The Chairman of
the Inquiry confirmed that he had exercised his discretion such that that period
of disqualification be served concurrently
with the six months disqualification
imposed in respect of the first charge.
Mr Plunket for the appellant provided us with a significant history of the
appellant’s life and asked us to take into consideration
the tender youth
of his client. His view simply was that 12 months disqualification for an
attempt to escape the imposition of a
penalty was not reasonable in all the
circumstances and in fact he considered that the charge under 175(q) should more
properly have
been brought under AR81A(1)(b). In his submissions he suggested
that it was an attempt only by her to deliver a sample or to tamper
hinder the collection of a sample. The circumstances that arose are properly
identified in the transcript before the Tribunal
and in the initial enquiry of
investigation. The appellant without doubt procured a false sample of urine for
the purposes of using
same should she be the subject of a test. She did so, she
says, because she had been forewarned on the Monday in question that in
preceding Saturday evening when she was drinking there had been a suggestion
made of someone tampering with the drinks that she
had imbibed. She alleges
that she felt unwell and sweated profusely during the evening of Saturday 18
April and the morning of Sunday
19 April which led her to believe that there may
have been some unlawful administration of a substance to her drink. The
was never rebutted or in fact questioned and this Tribunal is obliged
to effectively accept what she has said to be factual. Be
that as it may that
does not go to the heart of the matter so far as conviction is concerned because
the offence imposes an absolute
liability under the relevant legislation in that
she has presented with a substance in her system and as such is deemed, without
proof or adequate explanation, to be guilty of the offence in question.
Relative to the question of penalty however this Tribunal
most assuredly should
and is obliged to take the issue into consideration.
In that respect the attempt by Ms Carrigg to substitute the urine of another
person for that of her own was really an exercise in
futility. It was never
likely to have any prospect of success and in fact Ms Carrigg was, by her own
admission, attempting to dispose
of the false sample when she was effectively
caught in the act
. She effectively
chickened out
appreciating
that to do otherwise would have been a most serious offence and wrong morally.
Whether that is true or otherwise is
really something that this Tribunal does
not have to determine but suffice to say that all parties have accepted that had
charged under 81(A)(1)(b) then the penalty that would have been imposed
would have been lower than that of 12 months disqualification.
Mr Plunket has suggested that the case of
should be seen as
the benchmark. This Tribunal determined
on the premise that
the use of a substituted sample warranted the imposition of a severe penalty but
not that of 12 months disqualification.
In fact a period of nine months
disqualification was imposed in respect to
with the last three
months being reduced to that of a suspension. Ms Finlay for Queensland Racing
was staunch in her representations
that this attempt by Ms Carrigg was far more
serious than the attempt by Warrington however the Tribunal does not agree. If
could suggest otherwise one could hazard a guess that a reasonable person
would have considered Warrington’s state of affairs
and actions to have
warranted a more serious imposition but one has to temper that view with what
has occurred in the Racing Industry
in the recent 12 months. It is in that
period that there has been a significant increase in the use of so called
social drugs
and Queensland Racing has embarked on an attempt to stamp
out such use by members of the racing fraternity particularly those who
entrusted with the management, control and operation of thoroughbred horses
during the regime of racing and track work riding.
For these reasons this
Tribunal is of the opinion that the appropriate penalty that should be imposed
is that for the offence against
175(q) a period of nine months disqualification
should be imposed with the last three months thereof being reduced to a
and the Tribunal so orders.
Decision of the Tribunal
The decision of the Tribunal is that the
appeal against the charge under AR81(A)(1)(a) is reduced to one charge only and
appeal against that charge is dismissed and further that the appeal
against AR175(q) is upheld and in substitution therefore the
penalty imposed is
a disqualification for a period of nine months with an order that the last three
months of that disqualification
be served as a suspension.
For the purposes of clarity the Tribunal determines that the charges are to
be served concurrently and that the appellant effectively
be disqualified for a
six month period and thereafter serve a further three month period of
suspension. It is the order of this
Tribunal that the deposit be refunded.
