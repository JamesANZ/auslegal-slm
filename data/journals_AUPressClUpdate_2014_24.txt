Media Release | 16 December 2014
Coverage of the Sydney hostage incident
The Chair of the Press Council, Prof Julian Disney, has urged media to be
accurate and responsible in their coverage of the Martin
Place incident.
Prof Disney said: "Much of the coverage has been excellent and has not
hesitated to tell painful truths when necessary. But there
have been some deeply
regrettable errors and exaggerations, spreading dangerous misinformation without
any reasonable basis. This
safety, as well as causing an unjustified level of fear and distrust across the
community.”
