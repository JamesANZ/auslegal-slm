IPP 1 – Collection
– Comments on the necessity of

_____________________________________________________________________
The Complainant attended a job interview for a role
at the Public Sector Employer (‘the Organisation’). At the
of the interview, the organisation requested the Complainant provide
copies of her driver’s licence, passport, professional
registration
certificate and an original, completed National Criminal History Record Check
form (‘the identity documents’).
The Complainant provided the above
The Complainant was subsequently appointed to the role. Prior to her
commencement, the Organisation called the Complainant to check
documents had been collected at interview, and the Complainant confirmed that
The Complainant attended an orientation shift at the Organisation and was
informed that the Human Resources (HR) department had not
received the identity
documents and that the Complainant needed to provide another 100 points of
identification before starting her
next shift.
After the Complainant queried this, the HR department advised the Complainant
that the documents were probably still in the internal
organisational mail
system. As the Complainant did not have her passport, registration or other
information with her at that time,
the Complainant further provided copies of
her driver’s licence, credit cards and Medicare cards.
Approximately one week later, the Complainant again received a request from
the Organisation for her identity documents. The Complainant
immediately queried
this, and was again told that the original identity documents had not been
received by the HR department.
After repeated correspondence, the
Organisation confirmed that it could not locate the identity documents that the
Complainant had
supplied at interview. After further queries, the Complainant
discovered that not all the identity documents she had provided were
but also missing were the notes taken by interviewers and notes made during
referee checks (‘the employment documents’).
The Complainant
made numerous attempts to follow up with the Organisation as to what had
happened to both the identity and employment
documents, but each time the
Complainant was referred onto different individuals within the Organisation who
were unable to resolve
her concerns.
The Complainant then complained to
the Privacy Commissioner alleging that the Organisation had failed to take
reasonable steps to
protect her personal information (the identity and
employment documents) from loss under Information Privacy Principle (IPP) 4.
Response by Organisation:
The Organisation responded to the Complaint,
apologising for any distress caused. It noted that it was a large organisation
many new employees each year and it was normal practice to use the
organisation’s internal mail system to deliver such documents.
The Organisation confirmed that copies were taken of the relevant documents
and dispatched in the internal mail system, but advised
that there was no record
of them being received by the HR department. Despite investigations at both the
HR department and the dispatching
office, the Organisation was unable to locate
the identity documents.
The Organisation conducted a review of the mail
room processes and concluded that the systems were ‘robust’ but
acknowledged
that, due to the high volumes of traffic involved, there was a
potential for items to be lost.
Acting Privacy Commissioner’s decision:
The Acting Privacy Commissioner decided to refer the matter to
conciliation.
In his decision, the Acting Commissioner noted that while the organisation
appeared to have taken some steps to address the missing
documents (including
investigations and audits) after becoming aware of the issue, they were not
sufficient to resolve the matter.
The Complainant remained concerned about the
whereabouts of her identity documents, potential identity theft and was
dissatisfied
with the way the Organisation responded to her repeated
The Acting Commissioner also questioned the practice of collection of
identity documents at the interview stage (in relation to IPP
1.1), stating:
“I also consider [the Organisation’s] practice of collecting
these identity documents at interview to be questionable.
It is not clear why
they require both a passport and driver’s licence to establish identity,
or why these documents could not
be sighted rather than copied.”
Conciliation
The complaint was resolved with the Organisation
agreeing to:
Pay compensation
for losses incurred or expected to be incurred by the Complainant;
policies relating to handling of personal information collected during the
recruitment process and to provide the results
of the review (and any changes)
to the Complainant;
Write a letter
of apology to the Complainant; and
Write a letter
to the Complainant detailing the fact that the Complainant’s identity
documents had been lost by the Organisation
(so that the Complainant could use
this in the event that her identity was stolen in the future).
