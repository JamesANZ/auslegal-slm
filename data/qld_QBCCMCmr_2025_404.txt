applicant says that in July 2025 there was a landslide within the scheme land,
which is a large property on an escarpment,
with steep slopes, undulating
topography, and dense vegetation. On 13 August 2025 the body corporate was
given notice by the Department
of Environment, Tourism, Science and Innovation
of an alleged release of contaminants (sediment resulting from the landslide)
the local catchment, and the requirement to address that. The body
corporate says it has worked closely with various professionals
rectification steps and liaised with various authorities and its insurer about
the matter.
[3] The body
corporate says the anticipated remediation is likely to require significant
earthworks, forming surface drainage paths,
flattening slopes, and revegetation.
It says stage 1 of the works are to secure the site and ensure no further impact
to the waterway
and private property. It has obtained a single quote for
$80,415 (plus GST) for the stage 1 works.
[4] The body
corporate seeks authority to reduce the notice period to 7 days for an EGM to
consider a motion to engage a contractor
to undertake the stage 1 works. It
says it has professional advice these works are required as soon as possible to
mitigate the
risk of further damage, particularly as storm season approaches.

then is whether an order is warranted.

Determination
of the Standard Module requires a general meeting to be held at least
21 days after notice of the meeting is given to all owners.
In calculating the
notice period,
section 38(1)
Acts Interpretation Act
says the day of giving the notice and the day of the meeting are
excluded. So, there must be 21 clear days from the giving of the
notice to the
[15] The courts
have recognised that the detailed nature of the body corporate regulations make
it almost inevitable that there will
be non-compliance from time to time. It
has been said that the statutory obligation on a body corporate to act
reasonably does not
mean every minor irregularity should be used to impede the
normal conduct of business, and that ‘administrative perfection’
not required. Furthermore, meetings and meeting decisions are to be preserved
despite minor errors or procedural irregularities,
unless it can be shown that
the body corporate acted unreasonably or that voters were
disadvantaged.
So a meeting may
not be invalid simply because insufficient notice was given.
[16] But an
adjudicator has no general statutory power to authorise non-compliance with the
legislation. Accordingly, an adjudicator
could not authorise a body corporate
to call a general meeting that did not comply with the regulations governing the

Court has specifically commented on the order of an adjudicator which purported

period requirements.
were raised about whether the particular dispute amounted to emergency
circumstances for the purposes of section 243A
of the Act, although the Court
was not persuaded that it was inappropriate for the Commissioner to proceed with
the application.
[18] But more
substantively, the Supreme Court was not persuaded that the application fell
within section 227(2) of the Act for the
purposes of the order to dispense with
the notice requirements in the
regulations.
Chief Justice
Bowskill said,
“There is no power otherwise conferred by the Act or
Regulation to dispense with, or truncate, the period of notice required
meeting. And the description of the orders able to be made by an adjudicator
– as broad as they undoubtedly are –
do not include dispensing with,
or truncating, the period of
Honour said she did not consider the adjudicator had power to make an order
which had the effect of waiving compliance with the
requirement.
[19] Because
procedural non-compliance will not automatically invalidate a meeting, from
time-to-time adjudicators have previously
made a declaration to the effect that
a particular meeting will not be invalid because less than the required amount
of notice was
given (albeit usually dismissing requests for authority to shorten
the notice period). But given the comments of the Chief Justice,
questionable whether even an order of that nature is open to an adjudicator.
[20] In any
event, the applicant has not satisfied me of ‘emergency
circumstances’ that would empower an adjudicator to
intervene here. On
the submitted material it certainly appears the body corporate should pursue
rectification work as soon as possible,
and I note the constraints of the
forthcoming Christmas period and the storm season. But necessity and urgency
does not necessarily
amount to an emergency. And the application does not
indicate any deadline or particular consequences of a further 2-week delay
(being the difference between 7 days’ notice and 21 days’ notice)
given all that has occurred to date.

But I am not satisfied the circumstances warrant
the intervention of an
adjudicator’s order even if there was an order that an adjudicator could

a further observation. In the Supreme Court matter noted above, Chief Justice
Bowskill noted that a procedural irregularity
was capable of being cured by
subsequent ratification.
that case, her Honour was referring to the authority to commence legal
proceedings. But arguably it could extend to engaging
a contractor. I do not
purport to give advice or make any recommendations to the body corporate about
how to proceed, particularly
given the limited information provided to me at
this stage. But if it was confident that all or most owners supported the
of the contractor for the quoted works, and if the proposed motion
was otherwise valid, and if it was otherwise acting reasonably
circumstances, potentially the committee could consider resolving to engage the
contractor itself and then seek ratification
of that decision at a general
meeting convened in compliance with the requisite notice. I note the case law
regarding effective
ratification.
