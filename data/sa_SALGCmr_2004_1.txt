ORDER OF THE LIQUOR AND
GAMBLING COMMISSIONER
Application No:
Licence No:
ROOSTERS' CLUB
255 MAIN NORTH ROAD
SEFTON PARK 5083
ROOSTERS' CLUB
Effective Date:
15 June 2004
APPLICATION FOR A GAMING MACHINE LICENCE
Section 14(1)
The Roosters Club Inc has applied for a gaming machine licence in respect of
new premises on Grand Junction Road, Northfield currently
occupied by the
Greenacres Football Club.
The Roosters Club Inc holds a club licence and a gaming machine licence in
respect of premises at 255 Main North Road, Sefton Park.
The club licence will
be removed to the new premises at Northfield and the club will surrender its
gaming machine licence and have
a new licence granted in respect of the new
premises, on a date to be advised.
Section 14A(1) of the
Gaming Machines Act 1992
provides that:
“14A(1) Despite any other provision of this Act, the Commissioner
cannot grant an application for
(a) a gaming machine licence: or
(b) approval to increase the number of gaming machines to be operated
under a gaming machine licence,
if the application was made on or after 7 December 2000.”
However section 14A(2)(b)(i) then provides that:-
“(2) However, subsection (1) does not apply to any of the following
applications for a gaming machine licence:
(b) an application made by the holder of a gaming machine licence who
surrenders that licence so that a new one may be granted to
the applicant
(i) removal of his or her liquor licence to new premises in the same
locality as the premises from which the licence was removed;”
Section 14A(6) provides that
“this section expires on 31 May
This has been extended to 15 December 2004.
Therefore, the applicant is entitled to apply for a new gaming machine
licence on surrender of the club’s current gaming machine
licence. The
question is whether the new premises are in the same locality as the premises at
255 Main North Road.
Mr Graham Burns provided expert evidence on the question of locality. Mr
Burns holds a Bachelor of Arts Planning from the University
of South Australia
and has practised as a planner for some 30 years. He has appeared as an expert
witness around 200 times before
the Licensing Court, the Environment, Resources
and Development Court and the Fuel Licensing Board on planning matters,
the issue of locality. He is a consultant town planner. I accept Mr
Burns as an expert witness on planning and locality matters.
Mr Burns’ report is on file, refer Appendix 4.
Mr Burns gave evidence that the current Roosters Club is located in the
Sefton Park District Centre
“which functions as a higher-order centre
and is the main focus of shopping, office and community uses for surrounding
and Councils.”
The Council areas are Prospect and the City of
Port Adelaide Enfield, in particular the former Enfield Council area.
The former City of Enfield covered the suburbs listed in Mr Burns’
report, and in particular for the purpose of this application
the suburbs of
Northfield, Northgate, Oakden, Gilles Plains (western section), Hillcrest,
Greenacres, Broadview (northern section)
and Sefton Park. I detail these
suburbs to show a continuum of suburbs from Sefton Park (the location of the
Roosters Club’s
current premises) to Northfield (the proposed premises)
which all fall within the locality of the Sefton Park District Centre.
On questioning, Mr Burns agreed with me that for the purpose of determining
locality for this application it is reasonable for me
to excise the area west of
Cavern Road and Churchill Road on the plan exhibit 3. I have shaded the area
which Mr Burns agrees is
the relevant locality in green on the plan.
I accept Mr Burns’ expert evidence that all of the area highlighted in
green on exhibit 3 was deemed to be in the catchment
area of the Sefton Park
District Centre when it was established.
The proposed new premises are approximately 5.5 kilometres by road and 4
kilometres as the crow flies from the existing premises at
Sefton Park.
However, mere distance is not the determinant. If it was I would say it is at
the outer limit of locality but commonality
of community must also be
considered. Mr Burns has demonstrated to my satisfaction that Northfield lies
within the catchment area
of the Sefton Park District Centre.
But there is more. Mr Griffin for the club provided a map of the North
Adelaide Football Club Boundary (exhibit 2) which shows the
current premises *1
and proposed premises *2. The existing premises lie in the far south west of
the clubs football zone while the
proposed premises are located almost in its
I am not aware of this concept being argued before in the context of locality
but in my opinion the location of the premises within
a club’s zone is
relevant to this decision. Mr Glenn Elliott, Chief Executive Officer, North
Adelaide Football Club gave evidence
that the club will relocate the under
17’s and 19’s training and its entire underage squad program,
including it specialist
junior football administration to Greenacres.
Prospect Oval will remain the senior training facility with SANFL matches
being played there.
The North Adelaide Football Club has made a decision to position its future,
particularly its football development in the centre of
its zone to
‘capture’ the younger footballer and club member market in its north
eastern zone, a younger demographic.
Mr Griffin also provided an analysis by Mr Burns of North Adelaide Football
Club members by suburb and sex. I am less swayed by this
because from my own
knowledge and allegiance I suspect that locality plays little part in football
team loyalty.
I have no doubt in finding that the proposed premises are in the same
locality and that section 14A(2)(b)(i) has been satisfied.
In finding so I have
had regard to locality in the more traditional planning sense and also in the
sense of a club’s locality.
I have considered the matters under
section 15(4)
of the Act. In my opinion
the proposed gaming area will not predominate as it will comprise only 25% of
the total venue, with the
other areas being a sports bar, dining area/saloon and
outdoor area.
Section 15(4)(e)is
The proposed gaming area will have floor to ceiling partitioning with two
entrances, one external and the other internal which will
be under the direct
line of sight of the cashier. The club will provide CCTV surveillance of the
gaming area with a monitor being
located in the cashiers cage which will be
staffed at all times that gaming is in operation. The club will install an alarm
external entry and this will also be monitored from the cashier cage. I
am satisfied as to
section 15(4)(g).
I grant a gaming machine licence to the Roosters Club Inc in respect of
premises at Grand Junction Road, Northfield on the same conditions
existing licence at 255 Main North Road Sefton Park. The grant will take effect
from a date approved by me in writing.
I note the surrender of the licence in respect of 255 Main North Road Sefton
Park, again from a date to be approved by me in writing.
