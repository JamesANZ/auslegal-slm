[2024] HCASL 327
applicant seeks leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal
of New South Wales (Preston CJ of LEC, White
and Mitchelmore JJA
agreeing) which determined in the affirmative a question of law on a stated case
concerning the interpretation
Local Government Act
(NSW) in its application to
Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997
(NSW), and set
aside orders made by the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales
(Duggan J) dismissing an appeal from a permanent
stay of proceedings
ordered in the Local Court of New South Wales (Magistrate D McLennan).
is insufficient reason to doubt the correctness of the decision of the Court of
Criminal Appeal. Moreover, an appeal would
not raise any legal issue of public
importance suitable for the grant of special leave to appeal.
leave to appeal is refused.
