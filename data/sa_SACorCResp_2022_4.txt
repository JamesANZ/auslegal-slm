BENTLEY, John James - Inquest Number 20/2021 (0052/2017), Responses [2022] SACorCResp 4 (22 April 2022)
Bentley, John James (Coroner Schapel)
Recommendation
- As far as police involvement in this matter was
concerned, the only topic for possible recommendation relates to the question
the precision of investigation into the last time a missing person was seen. To
my mind there was imprecision in that aspect
of the investigation in this case.
Accordingly, I
to the Commissioner of Police that he cause
Police General Orders to have included in them, a direction to police officers
are participating in the investigation of the disappearance of a missing
person that they must at the first available opportunity
and with precise, clear
and unambiguous language, establish the time at which a person was last seen and
establish the identity
of the person who was the last to see the missing
Response from SAPOL
Major Crime
Investigation Branch were allocated this Recommendation and were amending
General Order, Missing persons. The amendment
to General Order, Missing persons
will now include the following instruction, as per your recommendation:
...a direction to police officers who are participating in the
investigation of the disappearance of a missing person must at
available opportunity and with precise, clear and unambiguous language,
establish the time at which a person
was last seen and establish the identity of
the person who was the last to see the missing person.
