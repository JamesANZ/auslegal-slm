DR Marshall v Forest Practices Authority [2010] TASFPT 4 (19 April 2010)
File No: 2/10 F D4/2010
DR Marshall Appellant
Forest Practices Authority Respondent
This was the hearing of an appeal against the refusal of the Forest
Practices Authority (FPA) to certify forest practices plan number
“Tullochgorum” Mount Foster.
The Appeal was heard at Hobart
on the 14 April 2010
Mr RG Marshall and Mrs P Marshall, with Mr R Smith
and Mr D Ryan appeared on behalf of the Appellant.
Mr T Leaman and Mr R
Freeman appeared on behalf of the FPA.
FPP provided for the conversion of 240 ha of principally
delegatensis
Eucalyptus nitens
plantation and selective
harvesting of 40 ha of dry sclerophyll forest.
basis of the refusal appealed against was:
is listed as Endangered on both the
Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act
1995, and the Commonwealth
Environment Protection and Diversity Conservation Act
As the proposed coupe is within the catchment of Tullochgorum Creek,
which contains a recently recorded known site of the
Swan galaxias
entire FPP Area is classified as
significant habitat
The FPA Planning Guideline precludes the clearing and conversion of native
forests to other land uses such as pasture or plantation
within areas classified
significant habitat
of threatened fauna species covered by the
guideline."
FPA contended up until the hearing that all operations in the proposed forest
practices area, involving removal of forests or
clearing and conversion to
hardwood plantation, would be contrary to the requirements of the procedures for
the management of
Swan galaxias
evidence given for the FPA at the hearing by Mr T Leaman, ecologist, and
Mr R Freeman, Senior Fisheries Manager of the Inland
Service, was that the
Swan galaxias
had been established in Tullochgorum
Creek in 1995, pursuant to the provisions of the recovery plan for the species.
Between 1999
and 2006 monitoring suggested a small but healthy population
existed, with numbers sampled fluctuating between 33 and 97 individuals.
However, there were no fish found in 2007; only 8 fish found in 2008; no
sampling in 2009 because it was assumed the creek was too
dry; and no fish
evident in January 2010 or just prior to Easter 2010. The decline in this
population was considered likely to be
due to the lack of rainfall and the creek
largely drying up. The possibility that there were some individuals surviving
in particular
remaining pools in the creek, could not be excluded, although it
was thought to be unlikely. Those pools would be likely to be in
the 300m long
stretch of the creek subsequently referred to in this decision.
expert evidence was ultimately that the "significant habitat" of the
which required protection, was limited to a 300m long stretch of
Tullochgorum Creek extending north from the road crossing of the
creek in the
south-east corner of the forest practices area. That habitat could be protected
by excluding forestry operations (in
addition to the area already reserved in
the FPP), from the area constituted by a strip extending 100m to the west of
along the above 300m section. In their opinion further protection
would in all circumstances be unnecessary and unreasonable. In
particular, it
was no longer contended for the FPA, that refusal of the FPP was required for
the protection of the species.
was no evidence to the contrary, and the Tribunal finds
accordingly.
evidence also satisfied the Tribunal that refusal to certify the FPP would
occasion significant economic detriment to the Appellant.
Application
was made on behalf of the Appellant, to amend the FPP by providing for the
exclusion of forestry operations along the
above 300m x 100m strip. That
application was not opposed by the FPA. The Tribunal allowed the application
and amends the FPP accordingly.
decision of the Tribunal is that the amended FPP is certified.
Tribunal will entertain any application for an order for costs in this appeal,
if made to the Tribunal in writing with supporting
submissions within the next
14 days. If requested the Tribunal will reconvene to hear any evidence in
respect of any matter bearing
on an order for costs.
the absence of any such application for an order for costs the order of the
Tribunal is that each party bears its own costs.
