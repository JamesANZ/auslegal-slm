Wah-Meng & Yuet-Fong v Owners Corporation Strata Plan
[2001] NSWSSB 15
(18 May 2001)
STRATA SCHEMES MANAGEMENT ACT
APPLICATION NO : SB01/00265
SCHEME : SP19359
ADDRESS OF : "..."
STRATA SCHEME Randwick NSW
APPELLANTS : L Wah-Meng & W
RESPONDENT : Owners Corporation Strata Plan 19359
Pursuant to Section 180(1)
Strata Schemes Management Act 1996
the orders made by an adjudicator on 5 April 2001 in file SA01/00028 are stayed
until further order of the Board
REASONS FOR DECISION
The appellants seek a stay of the adjudicator’s orders so as to
preserve the status quo. The appellants submission implies
that being required
to do work would render the appeal futile. Furthermore the appellants point to
the time periods involved: the
application was filed on 11 January 2001 and
orders made on 12 April 2001.
At general law, it is well recognised that
a stay may be granted where unless a stay is granted the appeal will be rendered
(No. 2) 1879 12 CLD 454. I am
satisfied that to require the appellants to take steps as required by the order
may lead to expense
and inconvenience being incurred which would require
additional expense and convenience to undo that work should the appellants,
succeed in the appeal.
The balance of convenience favours the appellants
on the only material before me. Stay granted.
