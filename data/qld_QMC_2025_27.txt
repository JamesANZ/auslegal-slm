Previous Relevant Offending and Recent Sentence
[1] This decision should be read after reading the
earlier published sentencing decision of
Cameron Sargent (Department of
Environment and Science) v Anthony Michael Palmer and Asbestos Demolition
Specialists Pty Ltd
[2024] QMC 26.
[2] These same Defendants pleaded guilty (July 2024) and were both sentenced (11
October 2024)
for the commission of a number of similar offences under
Environmental
Protection Act 1994
[3] Those offences had been committed over a period of just over 3 years and 4
months (between 29 May 2019 and 7 October 2022).
[4] The previous offences related to illegal operations in the handling and
disposal of asbestos waste. Asbestos is a regulated waste
under state
legislation due to its ability to cause significant harm to health, including
Current Offending
[5] The current offences occurred after the previous
offending period and can be best described as a continuation of offending.
[6] On 14 April 2025, pleas of guilty to an additional seven EPA charges were
entered by the individual defendant Anthony Palmer
(Mr Palmer).
[7] Prosecution of Asbestos Demolition Specialists Pty Ltd (ADS), now in
liquidation, proceeded ex parte pursuant to
section 142A
Justices Act
[8] The additional current offences for sentence were committed between 6
October 2022 and 12 April 2024 and: -
Cameron Sargent (Department of Environment and Science) v Anthony Michael
Palmer and Asbestos Demolition Specialists Pty Ltd [2024]
(a) are not re-offending;
(b) are aggravated in circumstances when the offending period coincided with Mr
Palmer also being on bail from March 2023. Further,
that bail had a specific
condition that he must not commit any further offences against the EPA;
(c) increase the overall total period of offending by an additional 18 months;
(d) only ceased about 3 months prior to the July 2024 arraignment for the first
offences charged.
Additional Offences committed by Mr Palmer
[9] Mr Palmer was culpable as: -
executive officer who failed to ensure ADS did not breach the EPA;
(b) a party to
individual for making false and misleading statements.
Charge 1 [section 426(1) Carry Out Environmentally Relevant Activity
Without Authority]
is an offence of
conduct without relevant approval
in breach of section 426 of the EPA committed between 6 October 2022 and 12
April 2024.
Charge 2 [section 493(2) Fail to Ensure Corporation Complies with Act]
relates to the same time period as charge 1, and is an offence committed by
as an executive officer of ADS by failing to ensure the corporation
complied with the EPA
[12] Both of these charges relate to
receiving and storing regulated waste
without the
relevant approval
Charges 3 and 4
are offences replicating Charges 1 and 2,
respectively, but having been committed between 11 April 2023 and 18 August
2023. These
also relate to
receiving and storing regulated waste without the
relevant approval
[14] Charge 5 [section 361(1) Wilfully Contravene an Environmental Protection
Order] is an offence of failing, as an executive officer,
to ensure the
corporation did not breach an Environmental Protection Order.
Charges 6 and 7 [both under section 481(1) Make
False or Misleading Statement]
are offences committed on 29 August 2023 when
Mr Palmer made
false and misleading statements
to Departmental
Additional Offences committed by ADS
faced an additional three
[17] Charges 1 and 2 [both under section 426(1) Carry Out Environmentally
Relevant Activity Without Authority] were for receiving
and storing regulated
waste without relevant approval.
Sections 7 & 8 of the
Criminal Code (Qld)
provisions)
[18] These offences were committed between 6 October 2022 and 12 April 2024,
between 11 April 2023 and 18 August 2023 respectively.
[19] These offences corelate to charges 1 through 4 against Mr
[20] Charge 3 [section 361(1) Wilfully Contravene an Environmental Protection
Order] is an offence of wilfully failing to comply
with an Environmental
Protection Order issued on 29 July 2021 by failing to cease disposing of
regulated waste.
[21] Charge 3 corelates to charge 5 against Mr
Details of the Offending
[22] Offending was detected from drone surveys which
secured aerial imagery and allowed for volumetric references and identification
of changes on the relevant site. Site visits were also conducted, with
additional photographic evidence of offending obtained.
[23] Overall, an additional 156.27 metres of material had been accumulated and
spread on the site, being waste materials including
roof tiles and asphalt.
Samples of waste taken included the presence of asbestos.
[24] The overall period of additional offending is some 18 months.
of the offending occurred between early October 2022
and late August 2023, a period of some 10 months (
which equates to a bit less
than a third of the total time period of the prior offending originally
sentenced in July 2024
[26] Additionally, false statements were made by Mr Palmer to Department
Officers. These were: -
(a) that the
material used to construct new roads and pads had been obtained from suppliers,
for which receipts were provided. [Detected
because other evidence revealed this
to be impossible. The only logical conclusion was that the material used
contained regulated
waste and was not sourced from approved recyclers] (Charge
(b) skip bins
containing regulated waste had been lawfully disposed of, with records provided.
[This proved to be impossible. No records
were ever provided that showed the
destination or lawful disposal of this waste] (Charge 7).
[27] The overall impact of this further offending is that the site in question
now contains more waste, with an additional impact
of adversely affecting the
adjacent property.
[28] Even if clean fill was spread over the site, it covered areas contaminated
with asbestos and therefore becomes part of the contaminated
waste requiring
Sentencing Considerations, including Totality
[29] The previous sentences imposed for the earlier
offending, on a late plea of guilty on the day of trial, married those sought
the Prosecution at that time. A $400,000 fine against ADS, a $100,000 fine for
Mr Palmer, a Monetary Benefit Order of $74,544
and a Rehabilitation of Site
Order. Mr Palmer was also sentenced to a term of 9
imprisonment wholly suspended for an operational period of 3 years. Convictions
were recorded.
[30] The Prosecutor at this second sentence hearing did not seek a further
Rehabilitation Order. This was because the existing order
would also by its
requirements rectify damage caused from the current offending.
[31] The real issue to now determine, for the additional offences requiring
sentence, is a penalty that considers the totality of
the offending with the
first in time sentence but also reflects the further aggravating conduct of the
[32] When Mr Palmer made false statements and continued to offend after March
2023, this was specifically aggravated offending because
he was on bail at that
time for the earlier offences. Whilst not charged with any breaches of bail, his
conduct contravened a specific
condition of bail that he must not commit any
further offences under the EPA.
[33] The Prosecution raised concerns about the actions of Mr Palmer around the
cessation of ADS operating and the commencement of
Gold Coast Demolition Group
Pty Ltd, with Mr Palmer as sole director. Those concerns surrounded the timing
of events and the purchase
of assets and equipment from ADS.
[34] The conduct of Mr Palmer placing ADS into liquidation whilst operating Gold
Coast Demolitions, a company that has acquired ADS
assets and taken over ADS
business, is relied on by the Prosecution as an adverse factor in considering Mr
Palmer’s character
and enhances the need for a specifically deterrent
penalty on sentence. The Court has previously imposed such a principle.
[35] Mr Palmer’s legal representation did not accept the submission that
he deliberately put ADS into liquidation to avoid
payment of penalty.
[36] Mr Palmer’s association with another company acquiring the liquidated
company’s assets and conducting the same business
operations as the
liquidated company, on the balance of probabilities with reasonable inferences,
is certainly an aggravating factor.
This is truly relevant when considering
personal deterrence.
[37] The Prosecution sought an additional suspended sentence of 6 months
imprisonment wholly suspended for 3 years with a fine of
between $40,000 and
$50,000 (being 40-50% of the first in time fine imposed).
[38] Counsel for the Mr Palmer did not resist the suspended imprisonment
sentence submission. The defence submission was for the
imposition of an
additional fine of
[39] The totality principle requires consideration of aggregate offending to
impose a sentence that reflects the total criminality.
[40] The maximum penalty for an individual committing an offence of making a
false or misleading statement is a fine of $120,000.
For pollution of land, it
is $250,000.

[41] Sentences imposed in the matter of
EPA v. Afram
(2022) NSWLEC 38
were relied on as comparative by the Prosecution, but with the submission that
Mr Palmer’s conduct was more serious given the
period of his offending
conduct, the fraudulent statements he made, the number of offences committed and
the maximum penalties that
[42] As for ADS, the corporate defendant in liquidation, the Prosecutor relied
upon the law that general deterrence is important
and insolvency should not be a
barrier to financial penalties.
The penalty set
within discrete industry sectors signifies the magnitude of what might be
imposed on others engaging in similar conduct.
It may also be
that a related company may be able to pay the fine, or, at the completion of
liquidation, there may be funds available.
[43] In the context of the defendants’ overall offending and previous
conduct and history, convictions being recorded was inevitable.
[44] The Court must sentence Mr Palmer and ADS after
considering:-
(i) the facts
of the offending;
offending history;
(iii) totality
principles;
aggravating feature of committing some offending whilst on bail;
aggravating feature of committing some offending contrary to a specific bail
condition prohibiting the commission of EPA offences;
(vi) general
deterrence;
(vii) personal
deterrence;
(viii) community
protection;
caused, including potential harm;
(x) imprisonment
being a sentence of last resort;
taken to comply with the previous sentence Rehabilitation Order; and
(xii) submissions
made by both Prosecution and Defence (mostly aligned), with case law
comparatives considered.

to in the earlier sentence imposed remain relevant
