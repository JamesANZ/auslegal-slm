Date of Decision: 30 June 2025
Information Act 1992
On 24 March 2023,
Shane Peterson (
the complainant
to the City of Melville (
) under the
Freedom of Information
the FOI Act
) for access to documents containing
personal information and metadata relating to him, including opinions that may
or may not be
true, that were sent, received, noted or logged by named officers
of the agency.
By notice of decision dated 8 May 2023, the agency decided
to give the complainant access to an edited copy of documents, deleting
information that was outside the scope of the complainant’s access
application.
The complainant sought internal review of the
agency’s decision, disputing the editing of the documents released and
that further documents should exist. By internal review decision dated
24 May 2023, the agency confirmed the initial decision.
On 15 June 2023,
the complainant applied to the Information Commissioner (
Commissioner
) for external review of the agency’s decision, claiming
that the agency had, in effect, refused him access to further documents
to section 26 of the FOI Act (
). In addition, the complainant
disputed the editing of the documents released.
The Commissioner
obtained the agency’s FOI file maintained in respect of the access
application, together with the documents
released to the complainant.
of the Commissioner’s officers (
the officer
) made inquiries with
the agency, which resulted in the agency conducting further searches. The
agency located additional documents,
and the agency released all but one of
those documents to the complainant.
After considering the material then
before the Commissioner, the officer provided the complainant with their
assessment of the matter.
It was the officer’s assessment that the
agency’s decision to, in effect, refuse the complainant access to further
under section 26, on the ground further documents could not be found
or did not exist, was justified. The officer was also of the
view that the
agency’s decision to delete information on the basis it was outside the
scope of the access application was also
The complainant did not accept the
officer’s assessment in relation to section 26 and made further
submissions. As the complainant
did not dispute the officer’s assessment
in relation to the editing of the documents released, that issue was not
The Acting Information Commissioner
A/Commissioner
) considered all the material before her, including the
complainant’s further submissions and agreed with the officer’s
assessment.
Section 26 provides that an agency may refuse access to a
document if all reasonable steps have been taken to locate the document,
is satisfied that the document is either in the agency’s possession but
cannot be found, or does not exist.
The A/Commissioner observed that the
question of whether or not ‘all reasonable steps’ have been taken by
an agency to
locate documents is a question of fact for the decision maker: see
Chu v Telstra Corporation Ltd
[2005] FCA 1730
, at [14]. Consequently,
the A/Commissioner considered that, on external review, the judgement as to
whether all reasonable steps
have been taken by an agency to locate the
requested documents is a judgement for the A/Commissioner to make, based on the
circumstances
and the material before her.
The A/Commissioner
acknowledged that, when an agency locates additional documents during the
external review process, as was the case
here, it is understandable that an
applicant will be sceptical about the agency’s record keeping practices.
The agency acknowledged
that there have been issues in the past with its record
keeping and advised that improvements have been made. The A/Commissioner
observed that good record-keeping underpins the right of access to documents
under the FOI Act.
The A/Commissioner also observed that the terms in which an access
application is framed set the parameters for an agency’s
response under
Part 2 of the FOI Act and set the direction of an agency’s searches to
locate all documents which may fall within
the scope of the access application:
Re Guest and Main Roads Western Australia
[2009] WAICmr 24
Having regard to the terms of the access application and the searches
undertaken by the agency in this matter, the A/Commissioner
found that the
agency had taken all reasonable steps in the circumstances to find the documents
within the scope of the complainant’s
access application and that further
documents either cannot be found or do not exist.
Accordingly, the
A/Commissioner confirmed the agency’s decision to refuse the complainant
access to documents under section
26 of the FOI Act.
