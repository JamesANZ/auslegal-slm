Krafft, D.W. v Queensland Harness Racing Board [2002] QRAA 23 (5 December 2002)
RACING APPEALS AUTHORITY QUEENSLAND
[2002] QRAA 23
: 5 December 2002
Wilson Krafft
APPEAL FROM
A decision of the Queensland
Harness Racing Board pursuant to Rule 163(1)(b) of the Rules of Harness
APPEARANCES
: Mr Derrick Krafft appeared on his own
Mr Norm Torpey, Chairman of Stewards, appeared on behalf of the
Queensland Harness Racing Board.
REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr Leo G Williams AO - Chairman
The Hon Sir James Killen - Deputy
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
This is an appeal
by Mr Derrick Krafft against a decision of the Queensland Harness Racing Board
Stewards that he was in breach of
Rule 163(1)(b) of the Rules of Harness Racing
which provides:
“163. (1) A driver shall not -
(a) ... ... ... ...
(b) subject to rules 164 and 164A make another horse cover more ground than
necessary;”
The Appeal by Mr Krafft is against finding
and penalty and relates to an incident which occurred on Saturday 16 November
2002 at Albion
Park during the running of Race 8. The Stewards allege that Mr
Krafft, as the driver of Werrington Guy made the horse Master Vic
driven by Mr
Peter Greig cover more ground than necessary.
At the Stewards’
inquiry held after the race both Mr Krafft and Mr Greig requested that the film
of the race be shown. The
incident occurred at about the 1200 metre point of
the race when Mr Krafft shifted from a two wide position out to a three wide
and caused Mr Greig out four deep. As a result Mr Greig had to take
hold of Master Vic and the horse went back through the race.
film was shown and the Stewards made their observations at the inquiry to Mr
Krafft, he stated that he simply didn’t
see Mr Greig and thought that he
had plenty of room to move his horse out. Mr Krafft said that because of the
rain on the night
vision was difficult and he simply didn’t realise Mr
Greig was outside of him.
At the hearing Mr Krafft presented to the
Authority newspaper clippings commenting on the poor vision of 16 November 2002
and advised
that a number of drivers stated that the vision was such that it was
dangerous to drive.
On a viewing of the film of the race it is clear
that Mr Krafft’s horse moved out and caused Master Vic to cover more
than necessary.
In relation to Mr Krafft’s submission that
he simply couldn’t see because of the vision, Mr Torpey submitted that Mr
was the only driver who was charged for breaches of rules that night and
while vision was poor for a number of races, during Race
8 the vision was clear.
Mr Torpey further stated that if vision was poor then Mr Krafft should have
taken extra care and ensured
that there were no horses on his outside. The
Authority accepts Mr Torpey’s submissions in this regard and that the
of the breach of the rules have been proved.
The Authority,
however, considers after taking into account Mr Krafft’s submissions as to
future drives that a fine of $250.00
would have been a more appropriate penalty.
The Authority substituted a fine of $250.00 in lieu of the two weeks
suspension.
The Appeal fee is forfeited.
