APPEAL AND NEW TRIAL - PROCEDURE - SOUTH AUSTRALIA - POWERS OF COURT -
PROCEDURE - CIVIL PROCEEDINGS IN STATE AND TERRITORY COURTS - COSTS -
INDEMNITY COSTS - RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS GENERALLY
In August 2021 the Court delivered reasons for judgment dismissing an
application by the appellant to vary the Court’s previous
Poniatowska v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd (No 2)
[2020] SASCFC 5)
assessing damages for defamation against the respondents:
Poniatowska v
Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd (No 4)
[2021] SASCFC 32.
The respondents seek an order that the appellant pay their costs of the
application on an indemnity basis.
Held (by the Court):
1 There is no reason to depart from the principle that costs ordinarily
follow the event (at [8]).
2 The costs ordered should be on the standard costs basis (at [16]).
3 The costs ordered will be payable forthwith after the quantum has been
fixed by taxation or agreement (at [17]).
4 Order that the appellant pay the respondents’ costs of the
appellant’s interlocutory application dated 31 March 2021
(FDN 148) on the
standard costs basis (at [18]).

PONIATOWSKA v CHANNEL SEVEN SYDNEY PTY LTD (No
[2021] SASCFC 41
In August 2021 the Court
delivered reasons for judgment dismissing an application by the appellant,
Malgorzata Poniatowska, to vary
the Court’s previous
assessing damages for
defamation against the respondents Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd and Channel
Seven Perth Pty Ltd (collectively
2 Channel Seven seek an order that Ms Poniatowska pay their costs of the
application on an indemnity basis. Ms Poniatowska resists
any order for costs
(contending that there should be no order as to costs) and opposes any costs
ordered being awarded on an indemnity
Application for costs
3 The starting point is that, while costs are in the discretion of the
Court, absent other relevant factors, costs ordinarily follow
the event. Channel
Seven were successful and ordinarily Ms Poniatowska would be ordered to pay
their costs of her unsuccessful application.
4 First, Ms Poniatowska contends that the involvement of Channel Seven in
her application was very minimal and was restricted to
two hearings in June and
August 2021. This understates somewhat the work necessarily undertaken by
Channel Seven in response to Ms
Poniatowska’s application but in any event
the mere fact that the work undertaken or the costs incurred may have been
small is not a reason to deprive Channel Seven of an order for their
costs if the appropriate exercise of the discretion otherwise
is to order that
Ms Poniatowska pay their costs.
5 Secondly, Ms Poniatowska refers to a submission by Channel Seven that, if
the Court’s previous judgment were reopened at
all, the reopening would or
should not be confined to the assessment of damages but should encompass
liability issues as well. Ms
Poniatowska contends that Channel Seven’s
attendance at the hearings and participation on her application was partly to
their own purposes of seeking to reopen their case on liability; it is
difficult to distinguish between costs incurred by them for
this purpose from
costs incurred for the purpose of opposing her own application to reopen the
assessment of damages; and in the
circumstances there should be no order as to
costs. We express no view concerning Channel Seven’s foreshadowed
contention that
any reopening would have involved a reopening of all matters.
That question was never reached because we concluded that Ms Poniatowska
justified a reopening of the assessment of damages. The mere fact that Channel
Seven foreshadowed that contention is no reason
to deprive them of their costs
of Ms Poniatowska’s application which was dismissed.
6 Thirdly, Ms Poniatowska contends that she had a reasonable basis to file
her application to reopen her case on the assessment of
damages. In support of
that contention, she makes detailed submissions elaborating on the complaints
Poniatowska v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd
that we addressed in
Poniatowska v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd (No
including by reference to
the latter reasons for judgment. The reasonableness of Ms Poniatowska’s
application is addressed
below in the context of Channel Seven’s
application for indemnity costs. Assuming for the time being (without deciding)
Ms Poniatowska had a reasonable basis for making her application, that
affords no reason why costs should not follow the event. The
mere fact that an
unsuccessful party may have had a reasonable basis for a contention on which
they were unsuccessful is not ordinarily
a ground for depriving the successful
party of an order for their costs.
7 Fourthly, and allied to her third contention, Ms Poniatowska contends
that, because our assessment was the first and only assessment
of her damages
(the trial Judge not having actually assessed damages), she did not have an
opportunity to appeal to the Full Court
against a first instance assessment of
her damages. We observe incidentally that this was the result of our acceptance
of Ms Poniatowska’s
contention, opposed by Channel Seven, that this Court
should itself assess damages rather than remitting the assessment to a single
Judge for assessment. In any event, assuming hypothetically that our assessment
of damages had been undertaken by a single Judge
and Ms Poniatowska had appealed
against that assessment, the hypothetical appeal would have been dismissed and
an order for costs
would have been made against Ms Poniatowska in respect of the
costs of that appeal.
8 There is no reason why costs should not follow the event and Ms
Poniatowska should not be ordered to pay Channel Seven’s
costs of her
unsuccessful variation application.
Application for indemnity costs
9 The starting point is that, while costs are in the discretion of the
Court, absent other relevant factors, costs are ordinarily
ordered on the
standard costs basis.
10 Channel Seven seek an order that their costs of Ms Poniatowska’s
application be assessed on an indemnity basis on the ground
Poniatowska’s application was wholly misconceived and bound to fail.
11 Indemnity costs may be awarded where a party, properly advised, should
have realised that it had no chance of
12 In assessing this question, it is relevant to take into account any
warning by the opposite party that it considers that this
criterion is satisfied
and particularly if the opposite party identifies why that is so. However, the
mere fact of the existence
of such a warning, or of reasons advanced by the
opposite party for it, is not sufficient in itself to justify an award of
costs: it is necessary for the Court to be satisfied on an objective
assessment that, properly advised, the unsuccessful party should
have realised
that it had no chance of success.
13 In the present case, Channel Seven’s solicitors wrote to Ms
Poniatowska on 16 and 19 April 2021 contending that there was
no basis for the
orders sought by her in her application and warning that, if she pressed her
application, they would seek an order
for indemnity costs. However, they did not
refer to the specific grounds advanced by Ms Poniatowska in her application or
why they considered that those grounds were bound to fail.
14 In general terms, there is a continuum in terms of prospects of success
of applications to, or proceedings in, a court. It is
a matter of judgment to
distinguish between a contention that is rejected but was reasonably arguable
and a contention that had no
chance of success or was bound to fail. In the case
of Ms Poniatowska’s application, some of her grounds were more arguable
than others. Assessed as a whole, it cannot be said that, properly advised, Ms
Poniatowska should have realised that her application
had no chance of
15 Channel Seven in their submissions observe that Ms Poniatowska’s
application was misconceived to the extent that she relied
on authorities in
relation to the setting aside of unperfected orders. That is so but Ms
Poniatowska also relied on the power of
the Court to vary or set aside a
judgment pursuant to rule 186.1 of the
Uniform Civil Rules 2020
16 This is not a case in which it is appropriate to order that the
unsuccessful party pay the successful party’s costs on an
indemnity basis.
The costs ordered should be on the standard costs basis.
Payment forthwith
17 Channel Seven seek an order that the costs be payable forthwith. There is
no need to make such an order. Rule 194.4(8) creates
a presumptive cost rule
that costs ordered to be paid “are not to be taxed and do not become
payable until the final determination
of a proceeding, including final costs
orders being made”. In this case, the “final determination of the
proceeding”
within the meaning of that rule occurred in May 2020 when
final orders were made on the appeal. Ms Poniatowska’s variation
application postdates the final determination of the appellate proceeding within
the meaning of rule 194.4(8). It follows that a
costs order made in respect of
Ms Poniatowska’s application will be payable forthwith after the quantum
has been fixed by taxation
or agreement (under rule 194.4(7)).
18 We order that the appellant pay the respondents’ costs of the
appellant’s interlocutory application dated 31 March
2021 (FDN 148) on the
standard costs basis.
