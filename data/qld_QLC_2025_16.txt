The disagreement
parties disagree about disclosure.
[2] The active
objectors seek orders that Whitehaven disclose documents.
[3] Whitehaven
opposes that.
[4] There were
initially 13 categories of documents sought. Whitehaven provided some documents
or explained that some do not exist.
[5] That has
resolved all but four of the 13 categories.
[6] The four
remaining categories of documents are:
(a) each Group Risk report or profile for 2024 and 2025.
(b) each report or other document about climate-related risk (including, but not
limited to, constituent risks relating to operations,
policy, reputation and
strategy) prepared in 2023, 2024 or 2025 for any one or more of: (a) the Board;
(b) the Audit and Risk Committee;
(c) the Executive Leadership Team; (d) the
Climate Change Working Group.
(c) (to the extent not covered by b) any document(s) prepared in 2023, 2024 or
2025 containing climate-related scenario analysis,
as referred to on p 12
(including, but not limited to, any document(s) prepared by the subcommittee of
the Climate Change Working
Group, chaired by the CFO, that coordinated work
related to WHC’s climate-related scenario analysis).
(d) any WHC climate change risk assessment prepared in 2023, 2024 or 2025.
applicant in the main the case is Whitehaven WS Pty Ltd (“WWS”).
The documents now sought are held by a different
entity – Whitehaven Coal
Ltd (“WHC”). The two entities are related.
[8] The hearing
is listed to begin on 21 July 2025.
13 and 14 of the
Land Court Rules 2022
(“the Rules”) provide:
13 Disclosure must be for main purpose
A party must not apply for an order for disclosure unless the making of the
order is in accordance with the main purposes of these
14 Disclosure
(1) A party may apply to the court for an order for disclosure by another
party to the proceeding.
(2) The application must state the proposed scope of the disclosure.
(3) If the court makes an order for disclosure by a party, the party must
disclose documents in accordance with the order.
(4) Nothing in this rule prevents the parties to a proceeding agreeing at
any time to disclose documents to each other by consent.
[10] Rule 4
4 Main purposes of rules
The main purposes of these rules are—
(a) to ensure that when the court performs a function under an Act, including
applying these rules, the court—
(i) facilitates the just and quick resolution of the issues in a proceeding;
(ii) avoids undue delay, expense and technicality in a proceeding; and
(b) to ensure that a party to a proceeding undertakes to the court and to each
other party to the proceeding to—
(i) participate in the proceeding in an expeditious way; and
(ii) comply with these rules and any order or direction made by the court in
relation to the proceeding.
The competing positions
[11] The active
objectors submit that the documents:
(a) are relevant and for a legitimate forensic purpose;
(b) ought to be disclosed so that the Court can act on the best and most current
information available;
(c) are needed to enable a proper cross-examination of WWS’s lay
[12] WWS submits
that there are two insurmountable hurdles to the application, being:
(a) the Rules tell against making an order for disclosure against a non-party
(and this Court would be “very, very slow”
to deviate from the
Rules); and
(b) the lateness of the request for disclosure and resultant application –
viewed particularly in the context of the Rules
requiring just and quick
resolution and expedition.
[13] WWS relies
on the affidavit of Mr Shute, a solicitor. He deposes to the context in which
this application is made (late) and
the difficulty he says would be involved in
making the four categories of documents available within a short timeframe.
The non-party issue
[14] The active
objectors say there is precedent for this Court making orders requiring a party
to obtain documents from a non-party.
Cherwell Creek Coal Pty Ltd
v BHP Queensland Coal Investments Pty Ltd & Ors (No
There, the Court
made a ‘Sabre’ order
which requires a party to take reasonable steps to obtain documents and file an
affidavit detailing its efforts and results. The
power “may be exercised
where there is a real likelihood that the party to the proceeding against whom
the order is made would
be given access to the documents by the third party upon
[15] Such orders
are exceptional and discretionary
[16] There is a
recent Supreme Court example as well:
BSO Network Inc v EMClarity Pty
[17] WWS says
that the Rules preclude making an order against a non-party. It cites Rule
14(1). That submission does not grapple
with the decision in
Australian Pacific LNG CSG Transmissions Pty
. The question there was
whether the Court’s leave was required to seek third party disclosure,
because of the “restricted
nature” of Rules 13 and 14. The Court
concluded that leave was not required.
respect, I agree with paragraphs [12], [13] and [14] of
[19] Rule 14(1)
does not exclude the possibility of an application for non-party
disclosure.
submission that Rule 14 tells against the orders sought here is doubtful on a
second basis. That is, a
order is not strictly an order against an
entity which is not a party to the proceeding. What is sought is an order
against WWS.
The effect of the order against WWS would be to require it to make
efforts to obtain documents from WHC.
[21] Separately,
there is something incongruous about WWS saying that it should not be ordered to
obtain documents from WHC when:
(a) WWS is going to call employees of WHC to give evidence in the case to
support the position of WWS; and
(b) WWS has been able, in a relatively short timeframe, to pull together the
information in the Shute affidavit about how many pages
of documents are
involved and how much would be involved for WHC to make those documents ready.
Cooperation between WWS and WHC
is obviously possible.
[22] All of that
said, this is not an appropriate circumstance for a
order. There
has been ample time for the active objectors to seek the documents from WWS, or
directly from WHC some other way. There
is ambiguity about whether the ordinary
process of third party discovery or subpoenas has been used or could have been
used to obtain
the four categories of documents.
orders are intended to be exceptional. Exceptional circumstances do not exist
The challenge of making the documents ready
Shute’s affidavit
that a large volume of material would have to be reviewed to determine what is
disclosable. That would involve reviewing
for confidentiality obligations and
client legal privilege. In some instances, members of the WHC Executive
Leadership team would
have to sign off on what needs to be redacted from the
[25] The active
objectors do not contest Mr Shute’s affidavit. They did not require him
for cross-examination.
respect to Mr Shute, he describes steps that, perhaps, make the task sound more
onerous than it actually would be. WWS
accept that some of the tasks which are
said to require the input or approval of multiple people across the WHC
Executive Leadership
team may be able to be coordinated by a single person.
There are ways in which the process could be streamlined.
[27] That said,
the task would be onerous and the challenges are made more acute by the hearing
being set to begin in only a few days.
To make the order sought would
inevitably divert resources dedicated to hearing preparation.
The lateness
[28] The request
for the documents stems from WHC’s 2024 Sustainability Report, which was
first filed on 10 July 2025 as an
annexure to the lay witness statement of Mark
Stevens. The four categories of documents arise from matters referred to in that
[29] WWS points
out that the active objectors were provided a copy of the report from as early
as 5 December 2024, and that it was
publicly available on the Internet on 25
September 2024.
[30] It was open
to the active objectors to request the documents months ago. If the active
objectors postponed seeking documents
so that they could make a more refined and
considered request, that postponement waited a little too long.
[31] WWS says
that lateness is, in effect, a reason to dismiss the application. When asked
for the authority that supports dismissing
an application for disclosure on the
basis that it was made too late, WWS points to the Rules.
[32] This case
has been carefully case managed. It has been subject to Court Managed Expert
Evidence under the control of an experienced
CMEE Convenor. That is important
context when considering whether this application could have been made earlier.
The role the documents would play
[33] The active
objectors argue forcefully for the disclosure. Despite their best efforts, it is
not clear how essential the documents
are to the issues in the case.
[34] The active
objectors say the documents are relevant to whether Whitehaven (whether that is
WWS or WHC is not clear) considers
the economic future of coal to be positive,
or whether it might suspect otherwise. The economic future of coal is the
expert evidence in the case. The active objectors will be able to
explore that topic through that expert evidence.
[35] To the
extent that it is relevant to explore what Whitehaven knows and what it expects
for the future, the active objectors have
some documents on those topics
already. If they cross-examine WWS’s lay witnesses about it and those
witnesses are unable
to answer questions, that may be a matter for submissions
as to the weight to be given to that evidence.
[36] Overall,
it is not appropriate to make an order requiring disclosure of the four
categories of documents because:
(a) the circumstances do not warrant a
(b) the challenge of making the documents ready would be a burden for WWS,
particularly at this stage of the litigation within what
has been a carefully
case managed process; and
(c) the four categories of documents are likely in excess of what is required
for the litigation and that ambiguity rests with the
applicant for disclosure.
[37] The Court
is conscious of the active objectors’ concern that the case might not be
argued on the best and most current
information available. That will be
something that the active objectors may choose to explore with WWS’s lay
witnesses, or
something that is presented by the expert witnesses in any case.
[38] The Court
must balance that concern with the purpose of the Rules – to facilitate
the just and quick resolution of the
issues in a proceeding, and avoid undue
delay, expense and technicality.
[39] The General
Application filed by the active objectors on 1 July 2025 is dismissed.
