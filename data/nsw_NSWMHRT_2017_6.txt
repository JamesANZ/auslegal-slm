the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre (MRRC)
pursuant to an Order of the
Tribunal. Mr Hogarth’s treating team are seeking no change to his current
order which, in addition
to requiring him to be detained in the MRRC, provides
for him to be transferred to the Forensic Hospital to receive care and treatment
as soon as a bed becomes available. He is currently 12
Flow list for transfer to the Forensic Hospital.

family support from his parents and
sister who regularly visit him and regularly

MENTAL STATE, INCLUDING THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANY DETERIORATION IN MENTAL
7. Mr Hogarth has a diagnosis of treatment resistant schizophrenia featuring
“paranoia, delusions of mind reading and auditory
hallucinations
complicated by treatment non-compliance and illicit substance and alcohol use
and poor treatment engagement”.(Psychiatrist

insight into his illness whilst being managed by the local Community Mental

in violence towards members of his family.
ANY RELEVANT PHYSICAL CONDITION:

9. Mr Hogarth has a lengthy history of chronic treatment-resistant
schizophrenia, exacerbated by drug and alcohol use and non-compliance
medication. He also has a lengthy criminal history which has frequently seen him
incarcerated. He was an involuntary patient
at the local Mental Health Unit when
he killed his roommate (the index offence).

10. His treating psychiatrist informed the Tribunal that the most significant
development is the improvement in Mr Hogarth’s
insight into his mental
illness. He attributes the amelioration of his psychotic symptoms to the
prescribed medications and told
the treating team that he felt better and
calmer. He acknowledges that he has a life-long illness necessitating long-term
His current medication is Paliperidone 100mg IMI monthly.
FUTURE PLANS IN RELATION TO CARE, TREATMENT OR CONTROL OF THE
11. Mr Hogarth has been treated with a large array of anti-psychotic
medications including Clozapine. It was suggested that he had
not tolerated this
drug well. The treating team are hoping that a bed soon comes available at the
Forensic Hospital in order that
he can be transferred there. Mr Hogarth told the
Tribunal that he will consider a further trial of Clozapine once he is
transferred
to the Forensic Hospital. His treating psychiatrist also believes
that Mr Hogarth will benefit from drug and alcohol treatment and
psychosocial
rehabilitation.
12. The Tribunal determined that Mr Hogarth requires long-term psychiatric
rehabilitation. His current detention in the MRRC is currently
restrictive and most appropriate facility to provide for his care and treatment.

long-term treatment needs can
best be met at the Forensic Hospital.

by the Tribunal on 21 October 2016: That subject to a
