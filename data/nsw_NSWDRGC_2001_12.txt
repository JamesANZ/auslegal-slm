1. The offender has applied for admission to a Drug
Court program. He could only be placed on a Drug Court program if he was an
person” within the meaning of
Drug Court Act
2. The prosecution contends that the offender’s is not an
eligible person as his usual place of residence is outside the catchment
for the Drug Court.
Section 5(1)(e)
of the Act provides that in order to be an
eligible person an offender must comply with any requirements imposed by the
regulations.
One of the requirements imposed by the regulations is that an
offender’s usual place of residence is in the Drug Court catchment
which is defined by reference to various local government boundaries.
The offender is 19 years of age. After arriving in Australia in 1990, he resided
with his family at an address in Bonnyrigg which
is in the catchment area. He
attended the Bonnyrigg High School. His family still resides at that address,
having been there for
some 11 years now. At one stage, the offender resided at
an address in Cabramatta. That address appears on police records as an address
for the offender but it is not contended on the part of either party that that
is in fact the offender’s current usual place
of residence.
offender served a term of imprisonment in 2001 and was released on 25 July. For
a period of a week or two after that, he resided
with his family at Bonnyrigg.
He then obtained employment in Leichhardt at a bakery. The employment commenced
in early August 2001.
The employer indicated that the offender ought to obtain
accommodation closer to Leichhardt as he had to undertake shift work. The
offender then moved to a shared flat at Campsie, an address which is outside the
Drug Court catchment area. This address was provided
to the supervising
probation and parole officer, i.e. the person who was supervising the offender
on parole. It is recorded at the
Probation and Parole office as the
offender’s address. While the offender was at the Campsie address, he
would return home
to his parent’s address at Bonnyrigg and stay with his
family comprising his parents, grandparents and siblings, on most weekends.
offender was arrested in Cabramatta on 11 October and charged with the matters
before the Court today.
5. The Director of Public Prosecutions contends
that “usual place of residence” within the meaning of the
regulations
is the place where a person chooses to spend most of their time
during the daytime, in terms of sleeping requirements, to eat and
to keep most
of their belongings, i.e. the person’s “home base”. I accept
this contention.
6. It is quite clear on the uncontested facts that,
from August to October 2001, the offender chose to make his home base at
It is most unfortunate that, because of this unlucky turn of events,
the offender is precluded from placement on a Drug Court program.
unfortunate, but no more unfortunate than a situation where someone on one side
of the street may be eligible to enter a Drug
Court program and someone living
on the opposite of the street may not. Until access to the Drug Court is
expanded to all areas of
the State, these unfair anomalies will continue to
arise. Regrettably, I find that the offender is not an eligible person.
