In the Review of P
An involuntary patient at Werribee
Mercy Area Mental Health Service
Date of Hearing:
13 October 2008, 24 November 2008, and 9
December 2008
Board Members:
Mr J Lesser
Involuntary patient –
Mental Health Act 1986
Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act
(Charter) –
– Charter rights
– freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment – Charter-
consistent interpretation of “treatment”
and “treatment
plan” provisions - review of treatment plan
In this case, P’s legal representative raised a Charter argument,
relating to the requirement of the Board as a tribunal to
interpret the
provisions of the Act consistently with the Charter. In particular, the
submission focussed on the interpretation of
several terms relating to
“treatment” in the
criteria and “treatment plans”
in sections 19A and 35A of the Act in light of Charter rights recognised in
section 10(b)
of the Charter that in effect prohibits “cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment.” The practical issue was
deleterious side effects of the treatment with depo provera which reduced
P’s bone density, causing serious osteoporosis.
At the time of the hearing, P was an involuntary patient being treated on a
community treatment order. P arrived in Australia with
his family in 1999 and
commenced treatment as an inpatient at EPPIC (now Orygen Youth Heath) in 2000.
In 2001, P was placed on a
CTO, and in February or March of 2001 he was charged
with a sex offence and was first treated with Depo Provera as a security patient
at Thomas Embling Hospital. In 2002, P was transferred to the Sunshine Secure
Extended Care Unit (SECU) as an inpatient. In May
2005 P was discharged to
Norfolk Terrace Community Care Unit and treated by Waratah Clinic on a CTO. In
May 2007 he was discharged
(on a CTO) to Footscray House supported
accommodation, and his care was managed by Saltwater Clinic. In May 2008, P
moved to live
with his mother in Flemington, and his day-to-day treatment was in
the process of being transferred from the responsibility of Saltwater
(Werribee Mercy area mental health service) to Waratah Clinic (Inner Western
area mental health service).
P’s general practitioner provided medical services to P in relation to
his physical health issues, primarily his diabetes mellitus.
At the request of
the treating team, he also prescribed Fosamax in an effort to counteract the
bone density reduction caused by
medications prescribed to treat his mental
illness. P was being treated with a number of medications including the
prescription of
Depo Provera, an antimale hormone treatment.
Charter arguments made in compliance with Practice Direction
In summary, the Charter argument put for P was as follows:
That the Board should interpret the criteria for involuntary treatment under
section 8(1)
of the Act consistently with the Charter, such that
“treatment” and “necessary treatment” be defined so as
to mean treatment which is not “cruel, inhuman and (sic) degrading”
pursuant to
section 10(b)
of the Charter;
the Board should interpret the provisions regarding preparation, review and
revision of a person’s treatment plan in sections
19A and 35A consistently
with human rights such that the authorised psychiatrist must consider the effect
of a person’s treatment
on their human rights, specifically the rights
of the Charter.
Accordingly,
where the Board finds that the authorised psychiatrist has not taken into
account the effect of a person’s treatment
on their human rights, that the
Board order pursuant to section 35A(2) the authorised psychiatrist to revise the
person’s treatment
In explanation of the submissions, it went on to note that P is 28
years old and under his CTO receives medication including a weekly
injection of
Depo Provera, an antimale hormone treatment, which administration has continued
regularly since first prescribed in
2001. As a direct side effect of Depo
Provera, P has developed severe osteoporosis. It asserted that the
administration of Depo
Provera constitutes cruel, inhuman and (sic) degrading
treatment under
section 10(b)
of the Charter and this limitation on P’s
human rights, given the deleterious effect of the treatment, does not satisfy
(proportionality) test in
of the Charter.
Response by the area mental health services
In response, the treating services (Werribee Mercy and Inner West) argued
that there was no possibility of incompatibility, because
the reference to
"treated" in
pertains only to treatment and punishment in a penal or
quasi penal context, and it was not intended to include situations involving
medical treatment. If the Board decided otherwise, it was further argued that
any limitation on P’s rights were justifiable
under the Charter
proportionality principles because the therapeutic benefits outweigh the aspects
of treatment complained about.
The meaning and application of “cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment” in
of the Charter
This was the Charter interpretation issue, specifically identified in the
application and the subject of detailed oral and written
What was generally agreed by the parties, and accepted by the legal member,
as relevant to the proper interpretation of
of the Charter, were the
following four propositions:
subject to the
specific limitation in the wording of
of the Charter that it do so "so far
as it is possible to do consistently with their purpose", the Board must
interpret the criteria
for involuntary treatment, the treatment plan provisions,
and all other provisions of the Act in a manner consistent with P’s
the Board may
consider, but is not bound by, relevant international jurisprudence;
to fall within
the scope of
, treatment must meet a "minimum level of severity", and the
standard is high, involving principally a question of degree and intensity;
a measure which
is a therapeutic necessity generally cannot be regarded as inhuman or
What the parties did not agree on was the extent or ambit of the
right, the relationship between the rights recognised by the different
sub-sections of
, and how the agreed principles should be applied to the
facts of P’s case. They also disagreed about whether
can be subject
to derogation and, if so, how
of the Charter, the so-called
"proportionality test", applies.
While conceding that it is most commonly raised in the context of penal
situations, taking into account the background provided by
the application of
the equivalent international human rights instruments, the legal member
determined that the right recognised in
can be applicable in a broader
context than in relation to prisoners’ rights or penal or quasi-penal
contexts or situations.
This can include situations involving involuntary
medical treatment under the Act.
The relationship between
(c) of the Charter
Turning to the relationship between
(c) of the Charter, the
legal member agreed with P’s submission that, notwithstanding the
different formulation and articulation
of rights equivalent to those in Article
3 of the European Convention and Article 7 of the ICCPR, the right recognised in
(treatment with full free and informed consent) has a more limited and
different ambit from the right relevant to P’s case
recognised in
Nor, in the legal member's view, does
limit the ambit of the
right, as the services suggested. The reason for this conclusion is a simple
reading of the wording of each subsection within the
Charter section.
Medical or Therapeutic Necessity
It was argued for P that there was a requirement for the State to
convincingly show that the treatment is a medical necessity, especially
imposes on a person's rights, but even so a therapeutic intervention can be
cruel, inhuman or degrading, and its characterisation
as a therapeutic
intervention does not automatically save the conduct from being cruel, inhuman
or degrading. In assessing the level
of severity - a composite concept -
required for it to be considered cruel, inhuman or degrading, all the facts must
be considered,
not just the level of impairment.
In their alternative argument, and as a fallback position, the services
argued that, if the Board were to decide that
can be applicable, it ought
determine that P’s medical treatment does not fall foul of the section,
based on international
jurisprudence that the treatment provided to P cannot be
considered cruel, inhuman or degrading because of its therapeutic aim.
effect, creates a higher standard of severity before it could be considered
cruel, inhuman or degrading and, in any case,
the case law suggests that the
standard of severity would need to be much higher.
The services also argued that the therapeutic benefits of P’s treatment
outweigh the adverse side-effects, and that the symptoms
for which the treatment
is being provided are referable to P’s mental illness.
The Board accepted that, as a general principle, a measure which is a
therapeutic necessity cannot be regarded as cruel, inhuman or
degrading, based
Herczegfalvy
test, and that it must nevertheless satisfy itself that the medical necessity
has been convincingly shown to exist. Despite the
fact that, with psychiatric
illnesses, it can be very difficult to be certain about the relationship between
observed signs and symptoms
and any underlying illness pathology, in this case,
the Board considered that the
Herczegfalvy
test was satisfied.
Level of severity
Notwithstanding its finding in respect of medical or therapeutic necessity,
the Board was also required to consider the level of severity
side-effects of the treatment, as it accepted P’s contention that even a
therapeutic intervention can potentially constitute
cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment, and its characterisation as a therapeutic intervention does not
automatically save the conduct
or treatment from being in breach of the person's
The more fundamental issue raised by the evidence was the potential for P to
suffer considerable physical harm because of the reduction
in bone density
resulting from his current mental health treatment. The weight of medical
evidence supported the conclusion that
the long-term prescription of Depo
Provera medication was the major cause of osteoporosis in P, and that his
current risk of fracture
is eight times that of a normal male of equivalent age.
However, there was also evidence, albeit less clear, that antipsychotic
also potentially increases the risk of a reduction in bone density,
and that any alternative anti-libido medication such as Androcur
is likely to
have an impact on P’s bone density similar to Depo Provera.
The Board concluded that, although at the time of the hearing, the level of
severity had not crossed to breach P’s charter rights,
deterioration of P’s bone density could foreseeably cross the line to
Charter right to be protected from cruel, inhuman or degrading
of the Charter applies
It was argued for P that, as far as limitations on the
right under
are concerned, the State cannot derogate from this fundamental right to be
free from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, indicating
that it is not
subject to proportionality, as treatment is either cruel or not and that, if it
is, it cannot occur at the hands of
the State. It was noted that
catch-all limitation and proportionality section, but it was proposed that each
right under the Charter creates different limitations,
and in each case a
judgement as to how much derogation and how to deal with the proportionality
issue is required.
By contrast, in their argument as a final fallback position, the Services
contended that, if the Board were to decide that the treatment
of P with Depo
Provera could constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,
Charter should be applied and the Board should determine that this constitutes a
justifiable limitation on P’s rights
in this case, in order to provide
necessary medical treatment and the best available care in the least restrictive
manner within
the context of the Act. Further, in their view, it did not fall
foul of the very high standard required to be characterised as treatment
breaching the right.
The Board could not agree with P’s argument. The framing of Article 3
in the context of the European Convention is entirely
different from the framing
of the Charter rights in
and the place of

matter of statutory construction, the legal member decided that there is nothing
to suggest that it should be treated any differently from the other
rights, although doubtless international jurisprudence which,
in relation to
other international instruments that have treated similar rights as absolute,
supports the view that, when undertaking
the proportionality analysis required
, the starting point must be that a very high degree of justification
would be required to set any reasonable limits to the
Other issues considered by the Board
1. Is the Board a Tribunal and/or a Public Authority for the Purposes of
the Charter?
The Board revisited the issues discussed in
impact of the Charter on the Board, particularly the dichotomy between being
categorised as a tribunal and/or a public
authority, in light of a subsequent
decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria in
Sabet v Medical Practitioners
Board of Victoria
[2008] VSC 346
(12 September 2008) (Sabet).
After an exhaustive analysis of the Sabet reasoning, and other relevant case
law on administrative and judicial power, the Board confirmed
its previous view
that the Board acts as a tribunal under the Charter in undertaking its hearing
function, but so decided that the
Board is not at the same time a public
authority for Charter purposes (in contrast to the finding of Hollingworth J
that the Medical
Practitioners Board of Victoria
2. The Relationship between the Charter and the Act in relation to the
Interpretive Function and its Decision-making Function
The Board was required to reconsider its five step approach to evaluating the
consistency of its interpretation of the provisions
of the Act with the Charter
in light of the recent decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in
Secretary to the Department of
In the Board’s view, at this stage in the development of the case law
, it is required to follow the approach suggested by Nettle JA,
notwithstanding any debate about the benefits of following the potentially
far-reaching approaches adopted overseas (based respectively on
Hansen v The
Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza
result, the Board’s understanding of the approach is that interpretation
of a statutory provision compatibly with human
rights should be considered in
the event that there is some ambiguity or prima-facie incompatibility
identified, otherwise the ordinary
principles of statutory construction would be
Notwithstanding that, the Board was satisfied that its five-step approach
outlined can continue to be applied to assist it to undertake
its statutory
construction task, with a minor modification to step 2.
The Board then undertook its five-step
. In relation
to step one, the Board considered that as well as P’s rights under
potentially, P’s rights under
sections 13
(privacy and reputation rights)
and 17 (family rights) of the Charter might be relevant to the issue under
consideration. The Board
also accepted that there is a genuine potential for
medical treatment for a mental illness to constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment in the event that the side-effects of treatment are of such a serious,
deleterious and potentially permanent nature that,
on a fair and objective
assessment, they could outweigh any therapeutic benefits derived from the
treatment by the patient.
In considering step 2, as regards its interpretation of the relevant
provisions in
sections 8(1)
, 19A and 35A, in respect of the terms "treatment"
and "treatment plans", the Board determined that there is consistency between
provisions of the Act relating to treatment and treatment plans in each of
the sections and Charter rights, including most importantly
considered that the treating services continue to be justified in their
treatment of P’s mental illness, including
on an involuntary basis.
Given the decision at step 2, it was unnecessary to consider any further
steps. However, if the Board were incorrect in its conclusion
at step 2 that
there is no discrepancy between the Act and the Charter, the Board considered
step 3, namely whether, applying the
criteria in the Charter, the
provisions provide a reasonable limitation on P’s Charter rights.
The question as to the relationship between the Charter and the Act in
relation to the Board’
interpretive function and its decision making
function was the subject of considerable discussion by the legal representatives
making their submissions, with a clear disagreement in their
. The Board
considered the
criteria and the submissions made and concluded that the
Act and the Charter appear to be consistent on the basis of the reasonable
justifiable limitation (or proportionality)
3. The Relevance of the Charter to the Authorised Psychiatrist and Area
Mental Health Services
A further issue that was subject to considerable argument during the hearing
was the status of the authorised psychiatrist and area
mental health services
for the purposes of the Charter. Although not strictly necessary for its
decision, the Board felt itself
obliged to consider the competing arguments put
to it and decided that, as regards actions and decisions in relation to
involuntary
patients under the Act, generally they ought be categorised as
public authorities and are therefore bound to apply
of the Charter. This
section requires public authorities to act in a way that is compatible with
Charter rights and make decisions
giving proper consideration to relevant
Charter rights.
The Board’s interpretation of the Act in respect of
P’s involuntary status and treatment plan
In summary, therefore, in response to the Charter argument outlined on behalf
accepted that any interpretation of the criteria for involuntary treatment under
of the Act must be consistent with the Charter. Accordingly, the terms
“treatment” and “necessary treatment”
must be defined so
as to exclude treatment which is “cruel, inhuman or degrading” in
contravention of
of the Charter;
circumstances of P's case, the Board accepted that his treatment with Depo
Provera can constitute "necessary treatment",
or, in the words of
Herczegfalvy,
"a measure which is a therapeutic necessity" in the
circumstances that it is being provided specifically for the treatment of
which are more likely than not the result of the mental illness from
which he suffers;
to determine
whether the treatment in question is a therapeutic or medical necessity at any
point in P’s treatment cycle involves
a careful analysis – a fair
and objective assessment - by the authorised psychiatrist, based on the advice
of experts within
and outside the treating team, of P’s mental state,
symptoms and behaviour, current and potential risks to himself and others,
the side-effects and effects of the treatment on P and his mental and physical
health; in relation to the risk analysis, a realistic
assessment of the gravity
of the risk, based on past history and a proper, objective and reliable
assessment process, is fundamentally
the Board also
accepted that, in cases such as P’s where a known side-effect of treatment
may give rise to serious, deleterious
and potentially permanent physical health
or other consequences for the patient, treatment, including necessary treatment,
can potentially
constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, which must be
avoided by all reasonable means
circumstances of P's case, the Board accepted that considerable care and
attention to his treatment has been demonstrated
by the treating teams at both
Werribee Mercy and Inner West area mental health services, including the
appropriate concern to properly
manage the physical health concerns resulting
from the side-effects of the treatment for the mental illness, as well as the
management of his diabetes mellitis;
however, in
interpreting the provisions regarding the preparation, review and revision of a
person’s treatment plan under s19A
and s35A consistently with P’s
human rights, the Board accepted P’s submission that the authorised
psychiatrist must
consider the effect of P’s treatment on his human
rights, including his rights under
of the Charter;
circumstances of P's case, in particular in properly facilitating the
relationship between the treating team and external
treaters including his GP Dr
NH, and bone density and forensic specialists, Drs ML and DSu, the authorised
psychiatrist must specify
with a considerably greater level of detail on whom
the responsibility lies for monitoring all aspects of the mental health
and associated physical health treatments provided to ameliorate the
side-effects of the Depo Provera medication.
notwithstanding
that the treatment plan provisions of the Act require the authorised
psychiatrist to provide "an outline of the treatment
the patient is to receive"
[s19A(4)(a)], in the Board's view, the more serious and deleterious the
potential risks of treatment are,
a matter requiring specific attention under
s19A(2)(e), the more detailed and specific the outline in the treatment plan
in an effort to reduce the risks as far as is reasonably possible;
evidence before the Board was that there was considerable uncertainty as to the
boundaries between the prescribing and monitoring
role of members of the
treating teams and GP Dr NH, and the regular review of P by external consultants
with various relevant specialties;
as a result, the
Board ordered the authorised psychiatrist to revise the treatment plan in
accordance with the discussion in its statement
of reasons.
Determination of the Board:
By applying the principles that it determined in relation to the key issues
argued before it, the Board decided that:
was no inconsistency in its interpretation of the treatment and treatment plan
provisions of the Act with the Charter;
deleterious side-effects of the treatment with Depo Provera could constitute
cruel inhuman or degrading treatment in breach of
Charter right;
treating team continued to be justified in treating P under a CTO, but the
treatment plan required review and revision to provide
a significantly greater
level of detail to ensure that the potential for the deleterious side-effects of
the treatment with Depo
Provera did not in the future constitute cruel inhuman
or degrading treatment in breach of P’
Charter right.
criteria for involuntary treatment outlined in
of the Act were met.
Review of involuntary status – The Board found the continued
treatment of P as an involuntary patient subject to a community
treatment order
was necessary.
Review of treatment plan – The Board ordered that the authorised
psychiatrist review and revise the treatment plan.
P was represented by Mr S Moglia (of counsel) instructed by Ms C Leslie of
the Mental Health Legal Centre.

Health Service were represented by Ms R Doyle (of counsel) instructed

Hearing Background
1 The Board had before it an appeal by P dated 31 March 2008, a review of the
extension of a community treatment order (CTO) and an
annual review. The signed
appeal document was received by the Board in early April 2008, but it contained
no specific information
or reason for the appeal. The appeal was originally
listed for hearing and rescheduled on several dates during April 2008. The
review of the extension of the CTO case was added after Dr AM extended P’s
CTO on 20 March 2008 for a period of 12 months,
and both were listed to be heard
on 21 May 2008, when the Board adjourned the hearing to 4 June 2008 at the
request of P’s
legal representative. The hearing was rescheduled to 2
July 2008, when the Board adjourned the hearing to a date to be fixed "for
Board to receive further submissions regarding how the Board should interpret
(a) the meaning of “treatment” and
“necessary treatment”
, (and) (b) the requirements of
and (e) with
regard to the completion of treatment plans, consistently with the
Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006
(the Charter)".
2 The Board scheduled the hearing as a special fixture in accordance with
Practice Direction 2007/1, added the annual review case
and, after consultation
with the parties, listed the hearing of the three cases together on 13 October
2008, in order to facilitate
a proper consideration of the Charter issues raised
on P’s behalf. At the conclusion of the day's proceedings, subject to
availability of all parties and representatives, interpreter and witnesses, the
Board adjourned the hearing to a date to be fixed,
added Waratah Clinic - Inner
West Area Mental Health Service as a party to the proceeding, and ordered that
the authorised psychiatrist
and case manager be available to give evidence at
the adjourned hearing and produce all of P’s clinical files. This was
P’s treatment was in the process of being transferred from
Werribee Mercy - Saltwater Clinic to Inner West - Waratah Clinic.
3 The hearing resumed at Waratah Clinic on 24 November 2008, when the Board
heard most of the balance of the evidence, save for several
expert witnesses who
were unavailable. At the conclusion of the day's proceedings, subject to the
availability of all parties and
representatives, interpreter and the remaining
witnesses, the Board adjourned the hearing to a date to be fixed. The hearing
at the Board’s offices on 9 December 2008, when the Board heard
the remainder of the evidence, and received final submissions
on behalf of the
parties. A further request from the solicitor for the treating services to make
an additional submission was received
on 13 January 2009 specifically in
relation to the evidence and arguments on the last hearing day about P’s
treatment plan.
This resulted in the Board delaying the finalisation of this
statement of reasons to consider an additional submission received
on 30 January
2009 from the treating services and an additional submission in reply received
on 10 February 2009 on behalf of P.
They are discussed as part of the
Board’s general consideration of P’s treatment plan (see below page
71 and following).
4 Prior to and during the hearing, the Board received a number of written
submissions relating to various issues before it, together
with substantial case
law and other documents in support of the submissions. A summary of this
additional material is provided at
the end of this statement of reasons
(Appendix 1). The Board considered all this material, together with all the
oral submissions
and evidence heard during the hearing. Because of the volume
of material to which the Board was referred, and to ensure that P can
the Board’s reasoning, in this statement of reasons, the Board has
directly referred only to the material that was
persuasive in reaching the
decisions it did.
5 In order to facilitate a better understanding of the evidence, submissions
and the Board’s decision, the Board has deliberately
broken them up and
discussed each separate issue in its entirety in turn. It dealt with the issues
in this order:
Charter Issues
1. Dealing with Charter issues and arguments
2. The relevance of the Charter to the Board
3. The relevance of the Charter to the authorised psychiatrist and public
area mental health services
The meaning and application of “cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment” in
of the Charter
5. Impact of the Charter on the Board's interpretation of the
Issues with respect to P’s involuntary status
1. Application of the
criteria and the Board’s decision
2. Application of the
criteria and the Board’s decision under
Charter Issues
1. Dealing with Charter issues and arguments
6 Before hearing and determining the substantive issue about P’s
continued treatment as an involuntary patient subject to a
CTO, Ms Leslie raised
for the Board’s consideration on P’s behalf an issue and argument
under the Charter.
7 The issue raised relates to the requirement of the Board as a tribunal to
interpret the provisions of the
consistently with the Charter. In
particular, the submission focused on the interpretation of several terms
relating to "treatment"
criteria and "treatment plans" in
in light of Charter right recognised in
of the Charter
that in effect prohibits "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment".
8 The Charter was assented to on 25 July 2006, recognising in legislation key
civil and political rights and principles. The Charter
came into full operation
on 1 January 2008.
Practice Direction 2007/1
9 In December 2007, the Board President issued Practice Direction 2007/1,
which is posted on the Board’s website at
www.mhrb.vic.gov.au
. This practice
direction sets out in detail the Board’s requirements for any party who
wishes to raise a genuine Charter issue
or argument that may affect the
Board’s decision-making. In this case, Ms Leslie raised on P’s
behalf a genuine Charter
issue addressed in detail in a statement in the
required form. The Werribee Mercy service, through its solicitors, provided a
response in the required form, which placed in issue a number of
aspects of the manner in which the Charter impacts on the Board’s
decision-making function and its interpretive obligations under the Charter.
10 All these issues were canvassed in detail during the hearing. At the
Board’s request, further written submissions were provided
to the Board on
several specific issues. The Board appreciated the efforts made by the
advocates who in their submissions - both
oral and written - greatly assisted
the Board to understand the basis of their respective arguments by clearly
articulating the issues,
the arguments and the application of the relevant
authorities cited by them.
11 Following the hearing of the first Charter special fixture, on 8 July
2008, the Board published a detailed statement of reasons
(3 June 2008)] (hereafter referred to as
, which set out a number of general
principles regarding the impact of the Charter on the Board’s
administrative and decision-making
functions. That decision is currently
subject to review by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT).
Pre-Hearing Arguments and Submissions
12 In summary, the Charter argument outlined on behalf of P in
the initial statement was as follows:
That the Board should interpret the criteria for involuntary treatment under
section 8(1)
consistently with the Charter, such that
“treatment” and “necessary treatment” be defined so as
to mean treatment
which is not “cruel, inhuman and degrading”
pursuant to
section 10(b)
of the Charter;
the Board should interpret the provisions regarding preparation, review and
revision of a person’s treatment plan in
sections 19A
consistently
with human rights such that the authorised psychiatrist must consider the effect
of a person’s treatment on their
human rights, specifically the rights
of the Charter.
Accordingly,
where the Board finds that the authorised psychiatrist has not taken into
account the effect of a person’s treatment
on their human rights, that the
Board order pursuant to
section 35A(2)
the authorised psychiatrist to revise the
person’s treatment plan.
13 In explanation of the submissions, it went on to note that P is
28 years old and under his CTO receives medication including a
weekly injection
of Depo Provera, an antimale hormone treatment, which administration has
continued regularly since first prescribed
in 2001. As a direct side effect of
Depo Provera, P has developed severe osteoporosis. It asserted that the
administration of Depo
Provera constitutes cruel, inhuman and (sic) degrading
treatment under
section 10(b)
of the Charter and this limitation on P’s
human rights, given the deleterious effect of the treatment, does not satisfy
(proportionality) test in
of the Charter.
14 In consequence, it was argued that the Board should find that the
provision of Depo Provera to P cannot be regarded as necessary
treatment under
section 8(1).
Further, the authorised psychiatrist has not taken into account
the effect of Depo Provera medication on P’s human rights
as required
section 19A
and the Board should therefore order, pursuant to
section 35A
, that the authorised psychiatrist revise Mr A’s treatment
Treating Service
15 In response to the original submission dated 3
October 2008, the service argued that, when construing the relevant provisions
, the Board should conclude that there "is no possibility of
incompatibility between the operation of a treatment plan made in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the ...
and the human right in
Charter, because the reference to "treated" in
pertains only to treatment
and punishment in a penal or quasi penal context only" (paragraph 4).
16 It went on to argue that, even if the Board took the view that
capable of application outside the penal context and might apply to medical
treatment of a patient in accordance with the treatment
plan, the Board ought to
find that the administration of Depo Provera does not constitute treatment which
is cruel, inhuman or degrading.
The reasons given were that the administration
of the drug for therapeutic purposes is not capable of constituting such
where the side-effects of the drug are not outweighed by the
therapeutic benefit, its administration does not reach the level of
required to fall within the scope of the Charter prohibition, and in its
interpretive obligation the Board must take account
of reasonable and justified
limitations on the right in accordance with the proportionality test because the
therapeutic benefits
outweigh the aspects of treatment complained about.
Arguments and submissions at the hearing
17 During a lengthy hearing over three days, the Board heard extensive
arguments from Mr Moglia and Ms Doyle, not only in respect
of the Charter
arguments outlined above, but also concerning the application of the Charter to
the Board, as well as to the authorised
psychiatrist and area mental health
service, in the context of
of the Charter. As these matters
are of considerable general importance to the Board and its operations, beyond
their specific relevance
to consideration of P’s involuntary status, the
Board proposed to deal with them in some detail in an effort to provide guidance
for the future.
18 Given the detail provided in argument, below is a summary of the most
pertinent aspects with the specific issues, submissions and
arguments, together
with the Board’s findings and decisions, dealt with under separate
Questions of Law and Questions of Fact
19 As the arguments developed, they involved a number of legal issues and a
number of factual issues. As the
requires questions of law to be decided by
the legal member in accordance with schedule 2, clause 3(1), an important issue
legal member was to decide which of the questions that require the
Board’s decisions are questions of law and which are questions
Having made that decision, what follows below is the decision and reasoning of
the legal member on the questions of law
and the decision and reasoning of the
full Board on the questions of fact.
20 It should however be noted that all members fully participated in the
hearing in relation to the Charter issues and arguments,
and formed their own
views about the strengths of the respective arguments put to the Board on behalf
of the parties. At the completion
of the hearing, the arguments, issues and
evidence were thoroughly canvassed and discussed by all members, who arrived at
a consensus
view about the resolution of these complex issues.
Chronology of Relevant Events
21 Based on the information available
to the Board, which was not disputed, the following are the key events and dates
relevant to
the P’s involuntary status and treatment history:
Circa 1992 P,
KH and family left Somalia and lived in refugee camps in other African
countries including Djibouti
arrived in Australia with his family as a refugee
treated as an inpatient at EPPIC (now Orygen Youth Health)
2001 P treated
by EPPIC on a CTO
Feb/Mar 2001 P
charged with a sex offence and placed in custody. Transferred to Thomas Embling
Hospital as a security patient;
treatment with Depo Provera commenced
conviction, P transferred to Sunshine Hospital secure extended care unit
(SECU) as an involuntary inpatient
discharged to Norfolk Terrace community care unit (CCU) and treated by
Waratah Clinic (Inner West area mental
health service) on a CTO
discharged to Footscray House supported residential service facility and
treated by Saltwater Clinic (Werribee
Mercy area mental health service)
mobile support and treatment (MST) team on a CTO
2008 Dr AM examined P and extended his CTO for a period of 12 months
moved to live with his mother in Flemington, with treatment arrangements
being transitioned in preparation for
formal transfer of the CTO from
Saltwater Clinic to Waratah Clinic.
Relevant provisions of the
22 Irrespective of the Charter, the Board was established to carry out the
functions set out in
. Its primary function is to hear appeals
by, and periodically review the involuntary status of, involuntary patients.
Section 22(2)
requires the Board in conducting hearings to "have regard
primarily to the patient's current mental condition and consider the patient's
medical and psychiatric history and social circumstances".

be treated as an involuntary patient. This applies to all decisions
made by and
on behalf of the authorised psychiatrist and the Board when conducting hearings.
for involuntary treatment
“(1) The criteria for the involuntary treatment of a person
(a) the person appears to be mentally ill; and
(b) the person's mental illness requires immediate treatment and that
treatment can be obtained by the person being subject to an
involuntary
treatment order; and
(c) because of the person's mental illness, involuntary treatment of the
person is necessary for his or her health or safety (whether
to prevent a
deterioration in the person's physical or mental condition or otherwise) or for
the protection of members of the public;
(d) the person has refused or is unable to consent to the necessary
treatment for the mental illness; and
(e) the person cannot receive adequate treatment for the mental illness in a
manner less restrictive of his or her freedom of decision
and action.”
Section 8(2)
sets out a number of circumstances under which a "person is
not to be considered to be mentally ill by reason only of any one or
(the circumstances). These include the expression of particular political,
religious and philosophical opinions or beliefs,
or particular sexual
preferences or orientation; engaging in particular political or religious
activity, sexual promiscuity, or immoral
or illegal conduct; being
intellectually disabled; taking drugs or alcohol; having an antisocial
personality; or having a particular
economic or social status or being a member
of a particular cultural or racial group.
Section 12AD
provides that any person required to have involuntary
treatment is to receive treatment for the mental illness, in effect creating
treatment obligation on the State. If necessary, under sub-section (2), the
authorised psychiatrist becomes the patient's substitute
decision-maker for the
purposes of the treatment:

mental illness.
(2) If an involuntary patient refuses to consent to necessary treatment or
is unable to consent to treatment for his or her mental
illness, consent in
writing may be given by the authorised psychiatrist.”
28 Since December 2004, the
has required the authorised psychiatrist to
prepare, review and, as required, revise a treatment plan for each involuntary
and required the Board to review treatment plans as part of its hearing
process. Under

Board’s powers, authority, discretions, jurisdiction and duty
conferred by the
29 In a previous Charter special fixture hearing,
, available on the Board’s website www.mhrb.vic.gov.au, the
Board outlined in detail (see paragraphs [72] – [84]) the
powers, authority, discretions, jurisdiction and duties conferred by the
together with the statutory scheme for involuntary treatment on CTOs (paragraphs
[85] – [92]). For the sake of brevity, this
Board does not repeat those
details, which it adopts in full.
2. The Relevance of the Charter to the Board
30 The first important question for the Board was to clarify its status under
the Charter. In
, the Board set out in detail its analysis on this
issue in paragraphs [131] – [158]. Subject to the discussion below, this
Board does not repeat that detailed analysis, which it otherwise adopts in
31 Since the Board published its decision in July 2008, the Supreme Court of
Victoria handed down the decision in
Sabet v Medical Practitioners Board of
[2008] VSC 346
(12 September 2008)
. In that decision, Justice Hollingworth was
required to consider the status of the Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria
under the Charter and made a number of comments of relevance to this
Board's consideration of this important issue. She framed the
relevant question
before her in the following manner in paragraph [121]:
"The question which then arises is whether, in making the decision, the (MP)
Board was acting in an administrative, or a judicial
or quasi-judicial capacity.
If the former, then it is a public authority to which
(of the Charter)
applies. If the latter,
does not apply."
32 Her Honour went on to note in paragraph [122] that there is no definition
of "administrative capacity" in the Charter and that
the explanatory memorandum
‘says that the term was intended to exclude instances where courts and
tribunals are acting in a
"judicial or quasi-judicial capacity". The common law
has long recognised the distinction between administrative and judicial (or
quasi-judicial) powers’. Hollingworth J accepted that the term
"administrative capacity" in
of the Charter should be equated to
"administrative power" at common law.
33 After noting the examples given in the note to
of the Charter and
considering the analysis of the High Court in
Albarran v Members of the
Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board
[2007] HCA 23
(2007) 81 ALJR 1155
,albeit in a constitutional context,
"judicial power classically involves ... the determination of a dispute inter
partes regarding the existence of a legal right or obligation
application of that law to the facts as determined",
Her Honour determined that the MP Board was conducting a disciplinary, not a
criminal, proceeding and, at paragraph [127] "in exercising
its power to suspend
Dr Sabet, the Board was acting in an administrative capacity. Therefore,
although a tribunal, it is a public
authority to which
34 In summary, then, according to the Supreme Court's analysis in the context
of the MP Board, it is both a tribunal and a public
authority in undertaking its
hearing function to decide to suspend Dr Sabet’s rights to practise
medicine, as it was acting
in an administrative, not a quasi-judicial, capacity.
Hollingworth J did not go on to consider the situation of the MP Board being
required to consider the disqualification of a medical practitioner from
practice, clearly the decision most affecting the individual
rights of a medical
practitioner in that context, but in light of her comments about the regulatory
context of registration boards
and disciplinary proceedings, it seems likely
that she would have reached the same conclusion.
35 The application made on P’s behalf pre-dated Sabet, but, in its
response, the service referred the Board specifically to
Sabet, and argued that
this Board ought maintain its previously stated position (in
that, in undertaking its hearing function, it is a tribunal, but not a public
authority, for Charter purposes, as it is acting in
a quasi-judicial capacity.
At the hearing, it was argued on behalf of P that the Board should follow the
Supreme Court ruling in
Sabet and decide that it is both a tribunal and a public
authority in undertaking its hearing function, and is therefore bound by
act and make decisions consistent with all Charter rights. This position was
supplemented by a written outline of submissions
provided at the hearing.
36 In summary, the following arguments were put to the Board:
37 During the hearing, in submitting that the Board is a public
authority in both its administrative and hearing functions, consistent
Sabet test, Mr Moglia:
expressed the
view that the disciplinary proceeding conducted by the MP Board, which is
regulatory, not criminal, in nature involved
what looked more like judicial
powers than this Board
determination dealt with whether appropriate standards were complied with, and
Dr Sabet’s status and his rights in
the sense of his capacity to practise
medicine, such that there appeared to be a dispute between the parties as to
legal rights and
obligations. Even so, Hollingworth J said it was acting as a
public authority
noted the orders
of the MP Board and their effect were not determinative of the question
went into detail
Mental Health Act
, which existed well before the
Charter, and its requirement for the State to apply and protect rights,
primarily patients’
rights, followed by lengthy submission specifically
related to how the Board should approach the
Charter issue
suggested that,
irrespective of its decision on whether it is or is not a public authority, the
difference in approach of the Board
and the end result might be the same either
way. However, as a public authority, the Board might "descend so far as to say
Provera goes too far", whereas, if its function is only interpretive, it
may limit its capacity to review specific treatments and
their effects and "deal
with facts and rights", leaving it to the authorised psychiatrist to do so.
Arguably, then, this would mean
the Board might not be able to balance all the
rights which might apply to the factual situation
referred to
R v Ashworth Hospital
(2005) UKHL 58
38 In his written outline of submissions, Mr Moglia summarised the
position as follows:
"1. The MHRB is a public authority during the hearing of this matter:
test applies
Board exercises powers under a statutory provision;
function are of a public nature;
publicly funded
, found to be acting as a public authority was exercising
powers in an even more judicial nature than here, yet it was still determined
be a public authority;
under the MHA is not in the nature of a dispute between the parties;
Board’s review function must be exercises even in the absence of a
possible to be a tribunal and yet be a public authority (Sabet [127]);
Hospital here seems to concede in [39] that the Board must apply human rights
reasoning when determining matters before it;
the role of the Board as a review body is an essential part of the system to
avoid breaches against breaches of the right here
2. Alternatively, if the Board acts ‘only’ as a
tribunal, the rights invoked here must be considered:
the same way as the right to a fair hearing binds the Board;
making orders to confirm, vary or revoke the CTO, must not make such orders as
would amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment;
a part of the common law as exemplified by
Treating Services
39 In its written response on behalf of
the services, the Board was provided with a detailed analysis in paragraphs
[6]-[15], noting
its previous findings in
, and Justice
Hollingworth's discussions in
. In its concluding submission
(paragraph [14]), it was argued that "the Board ought to confirm its previously
expressed view that
its hearing functions, including reviews of treatment plans
, are rightly to be characterised as quasi judicial in character." In
paragraph ([15]), it conceded that, if the Board adopted the
contrary view and
characterised its review function under
as administrative, then it would be
a public authority for relevant purposes, and is bound to conduct its functions
in a way which is compatible with Charter rights, including
40 At the hearing, Ms Doyle added to the submissions as follows:
the Board's
previous finding is consistent with
of the Charter, which establishes
who is not a public authority. She supported the dichotomy between the two
- administrative and quasi-judicial - expounded at paragraphs
[133] – [137], noting that Hollingworth J was considering a different
dichotomy between disciplinary and criminal proceedings, the former not in
effect determining anything, but rather assessing criteria
for professional
conduct against the facts;
operates in a court-like manner, requires a legal member as chair and as the
decider of legal issues, and exercises a number
of discretions under the
Board’s decision-making powers under
include the powers to revoke or
vary a CTO, whereas of the power under
operates in a different way in
respect of the analysis and determination of issues about treatment plans, as
the Board has no power
to vary, but can order the revision by the authorised
psychiatrist of treatment plans;
interpretation in
was surprising, as the functions analysed look
and feel quasi-judicial. Irrespective of the outcome of the analysis, this
is required under
of the Charter to interpret the
compatibly with
Charter rights and is restricted to the powers set out in the
, including
that it cannot change treatment aspects of a treatment plan, even though it can
vary a CTO;
the Board should
reaffirm its previous decision that, in its hearing function, the Board acts in
a quasi-judicial capacity, as it
is required to assess facts against the
criteria established, and exercise the powers it is given, in the
conclusive decision, which is binding until changed with the effluxion of
it is possible
that the way in which the Charter discriminates between public authorities and
tribunals means that some of its powers,
such as under
, are quasi-judicial
and others are perhaps administrative, such as under
Carl Williams
[2007] VSC 2 (Williams)
such a hybrid situation within the Supreme Court, highlighting how complex and
difficult the issue may be;
there are no
direct case authorities about this Board because of the jurisdictional
differences and the different definitions established
in the Charter compared
with other international instruments;
in comparing
this Board with the MP Board, the
appears considerably more complex because
the application of the
criteria is multifaceted, requiring a balancing of
treatment needs against patients rights against community considerations. This
tends to tip the balance towards a more judicial looking power or judicial
character than the disciplinary proceeding Hollingworth
J was required to
constitutional cases would be of little assistance to the Board’s analysis
because the considerations around Chapter 3 of
the Australian Constitution do
not apply to State bodies.
Response by P
41 In response, at the hearing, Mr Moglia
asserted that the Board’s facilitative powers, such as issuing summonses,
and adjournments, are required for operational purposes, but do not
make its hearings or powers judicial in nature. On his analysis,
the Board's
process of assessing facts against the criteria, and descending into factual
inquiries to support findings, are more
consistent with it being a public
authority. He also pointed out that the Board is not only engaged when parties
are in dispute,
but has a mandatory review function that does not require a
dispute. This tends to suggest that the Board is closer to a public
than a court, as does the ‘appeal’ right to VCAT, compared with
judicial decisions which, he would expect,
would be reviewed by courts.
Is the Board both a Tribunal and a Public Authority for the purposes of
the Charter?
42 The issue with respect to the Board’s administrative or registry
functions is reasonably clear and unaffected by
. The Board’s
executive officer and staff, all employed as public servants, clearly comprise a
public authority. Therefore,
when Board staff are carrying out registry
functions in support of the Board’s decision-making function, for Charter
they are acting in an “administrative capacity” and are
bound to act, and make decisions, consistent with Charter rights
43 The question before the Board is whether its previous decision that it is
acting in a quasi-judicial capacity in respect of its
hearing function is
correct in light of the analysis of Hollingworth J in
. Logically,
based on Hollingworth J's analysis, this requires the Board to undertake an
objective assessment of its functions and
powers under the
, consistent with
relevant case law, to ascertain which appears to be more in the nature of
administrative power and/or more in the
nature of judicial or quasi-judicial
44 Before so embarking, the Board noted that the potential complexities
resulting from the
analysis may have arisen from an interpretation
which is contrary to the logical and purposive analysis originally intended by
Victorian Parliament in passing the Charter in its current form. Noting
that the United Kingdom equivalent, the Human Rights Act
1998, opted for a model
in which courts and tribunals are specified as public authorities, the Board
considered that the clear dichotomy
established in s4(1) and s6(2) between
public authorities on the one hand and courts and tribunals on the other hand
was absolutely
intended and can be simply explained. The logical
interpretation, based on the purpose of the dichotomy, appears to be to give
to the difference in context of decisions made by public authorities, as
part of undertaking their administrative functions, compared
with decisions made
by courts and tribunals which, by contrast, for the most part, undertake a more
or less formal hearing and adjudicative
45 If that simple logical distinction was indeed the Parliamentary intention
to give effect to the purpose of the dichotomy drawn
in the Charter, as the
Board suggests is most likely, this would preclude the necessity for the
complex, convoluted and somewhat
arbitrary analysis of the meaning and
application of administrative function and/or judicial or quasi-judicial
function of bodies
like the MP Board in
and tribunals like this
Board in the context of the common law consideration of the issue in one or more
very different contexts.
Except in the case of VCAT, a deliberately hybrid
group of tribunal jurisdictions and lists, some of which quite clearly stand in
the shoes of public authorities making substitute administrative decisions with
all the original decision maker’s powers, this
simple logical analysis
would preclude the possibility of the Board being characterised as a tribunal
only in respect of some decisions
and as a public authority in respect of other
decisions. In the Board’s view, it defies both common sense and logic to
that such a result was ever part of the Parliamentary intention in
enacting the Charter in its current form.
46 Returning to the
analysis, it was conceded by both advocates
that there are factors relevant to this Board that are similar to those
identified in
in respect of the MP Board. However, their views
varied as to whether, on balance, this Board appeared more administrative or
quasi-judicial
in nature or character in undertaking its hearing function.
47 In paragraph [137] of
, the Board carefully analysed its
decision-making functions to reach its conclusion that it was a tribunal for the
purposes of the
Charter. This analysis remains valid, and is adopted, for the
purposes of this case. To these factors, two further factors should
which, in a fundamental respect, distinguish the role and status of the Board
from the role and status of the authorised
psychiatrist in respect of dealings
with, and decision-making about, involuntary patients. They are found in
sections 130 and 130A
of the Act.
48 Section 130 provides for the possible prosecution of a person for contempt
of the Board, in the same manner as would be provided
for in any judicial forum,
in the event that a person insults a member, repeatedly interrupts the
proceedings, creates a disturbance
in or near a place where the Board is sitting
or, most tellingly, does "any other act or thing that would, if the Board ...
a Court of Record, constitute a contempt of that Court".
49 By s130A, Board members have "in the performance of duties as a member the
same protection and immunity as a Judge of the Supreme
Court" (ss(1)), and
lawyers or any other person appearing before the Board have "the same protection
and immunity as an Australian
legal practitioner has in appearing for a party in
proceedings in the Supreme Court" (ss(2)).
50 In the Board’s view, Parliament is always sparing as to the
circumstances in which such provisions are considered appropriate
and desirable,
strictly limiting them to courts and court-like bodies, presumably in
recognition of the seriousness of the hearing
process and the subject matter of
the decision-making.
51 In analysing its hearing function for Charter purposes, the Board
acknowledged that there are factors or indicators, none of which
decisive of the issue, that may tend to a view one way or the other. However,
after undertaking its detailed analysis
and taking account of Her Honour’s
guidance in
, the Board decided that this Board is of a different
character when compared with the MP Board, and accordingly can distinguish,
is not bound to follow, the decision of Hollingworth J in
balance, therefore, this Board confirmed its previously stated position, and
determined that it acts more in a quasi-judicial
capacity than in an
administrative capacity, and exercises quasi-judicial powers rather than
administrative powers, as those terms
are understood at common law.
52 There are a number of reasons supporting this conclusion. They include,
most prominently, the inherently court-like nature of
the Board’s powers
and proceedings, and the protections Parliament has provided to members and
representatives, the fact that
the Board makes final and binding decisions on
the parties, and the fact that its decisions in effect either directly determine
rights of one party, namely the involuntary patient or require action by the
other party, namely the authorised psychiatrist. Therefore,
Board’s view, this obviates a requirement for the Board to distinguish
between different decisions made by the Board
under different sections of the
53 Dealing firstly with the submissions, the Board rejected Mr Moglia’s
notion that the regulatory context of the disciplinary
hearing procedures
involved what looked more like judicial powers than this Board. This is because
the disciplinary hearing procedures,
although extremely serious, particularly in
their consequences for individual practitioners, flow directly out of the
registration
responsibilities of a Board established clearly with the express
purpose to undertake duties and act in an administrative capacity.
54 While the Board agrees with Mr Moglia that the Board’s decisions and
their effect are not in themselves determinative of
its status as quasi-judicial
or administrative, they are one of a number of factors to be considered, and an
important one at that.
55 Turning to the services’ submissions, the Board was in agreement
with Ms Doyle that there are a number of important factors
which tend to support
its original conclusion that the Board acts in a quasi-judicial capacity in
undertaking its hearing function,
and that it is not proper to categorise the
Board as a public authority at the same time:
although always
attempting to provide as informal and flexible hearing procedures as are
appropriate in individual cases, it is patently
true that the Board operates in
a court-like manner, particularly as the Act requires a legal member to chair
each division and to
decide all legal issues, and gives the Board a number of
far-reaching powers which require the exercise of discretion under the Act.
example, under s36(4), having confirmed an involuntary treatment order in
relation to an inpatient, the Board must consider,
and has a discretion to
decide, in appropriate circumstances, to order that the authorised psychiatrist
place the patient on a community
treatment order;
in analysing the
Board’s decision-making powers, most, if not all, operate to directly
determine a dispute inter partes regarding
the existence of a legal right or
obligation affecting the involuntary patient and the treating service, as well
as the application
of the law (the relevant provisions of the Act) to the facts
as determined from the evidence. In other words, whether hearing an
lodged by a patient, which in effect institutes a Board review of the rights and
obligations of involuntary patients under
the Act, or undertaking a review
required by the Act, in its application of the s8(1) criteria, it is required to
discharge an involuntary
treatment order, if any one of the criteria do not
apply to the patient. This directly releases the patient from any treatment or
other obligation under the Act, and frees the patient from any constraints
associated with involuntary treatment. If, on the other
hand, the Board
confirms the involuntary treatment order, this decision directly impacts on the
rights of the involuntary patient
by requiring that he or she continue to
receive treatment without their consent or against their will from the treating
team acting
under the authority of the authorised psychiatrist. In either case,
other than the decision of a criminal court to acquit an accused
trial, it is difficult to imagine a decision resulting from a legal process
which more fundamentally or profoundly affects
the liberty interests of a
Victorian citizen;
as pointed out
by Ms Doyle, decision-making powers such as those under s36C include the power
to revoke or vary a CTO, whereas the
power under s35A operates in a different
way in respect of the analysis and determination of issues about treatment
plans, as the
Board has no power to vary, but it can order the revision by the
authorised psychiatrist of treatment plans. In relation to the
former power
under s36C, the power to vary or revoke CTOs is secondary to, and can in
appropriate cases flow from, its primary decision
to confirm the patient's
involuntary treatment order (ITO). Historically the Board has, in a small
number of appropriate cases,
varied CTOs by removing residential clauses,
thereby again directly affecting the rights of the involuntary patient in
their freedom of movement and place of abode. In respect of the
latter power under s35A, with respect to Ms Doyle's argument to
the contrary,
the Board considered that any statutory power to order a party to act in a
particular manner, such as to revise a treatment
plan or to place the patient on
a CTO is the hallmark of judicial or quasi-judicial power rather than an
administrative power. Such
an order is binding on the parties and directly
affects the rights of the involuntary patient and the responsibilities of the
psychiatrist and the treating service. Despite the lack of direct
enforcement powers by the Board itself, any failure by the authorised
psychiatrist to comply with such an order could be brought to account by or on
behalf of the involuntary patient in a number of ways,
including by complaint to
the office of the Chief Psychiatrist, through complaint to the appropriate
professional registration Board,
and, in the case of the CTO order, potentially
by a writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court;
the Board agreed
with Ms Doyle that, irrespective of the outcome of its analysis, it is required
under s32 of the Charter to interpret
the Act compatibly with Charter rights and
is restricted to the powers set out in the Act, including that it cannot change
aspects of a treatment plan, even though it can vary a CTO;
it also agreed
that it is appropriate to reaffirm its previous decision that, in its hearing
function, the Board acts in a quasi-judicial
capacity, as it is required to
apply the law to the assessed facts. This involves in almost all hearings
applying the established
statutory criteria in s8(1), and exercising the powers
it is given in the Act to reach a conclusive decision, which is binding and
determinative in effect;
however, the
Board rejected Ms Doyle's submission that it is possible that the way in which
the Charter discriminates between public
authorities and tribunals means that
some of its powers, such as under s36C, are quasi-judicial and others are
perhaps administrative,
such as under s35A. As discussed above, on balance, in
the Board’s view, all its major decision-making functions and powers
of a quasi-judicial character, rather than an administrative character, although
it did not reject the possibility that, as confusing
as it may turn out to be,
the hybrid situation within the Supreme Court, and other courts and tribunals,
as alluded to by King J
, is indeed possible.
56 The Board also considered the analysis of the High Court in
, noting that its context was specific to the determination of
whether the disciplinary Board in question (the Companies Auditors
Liquidators Disciplinary Board) was exercising quasi-judicial power, rather than
administrative power, in breach of the Australian
Constitution, which strictly
separates the judicial arm of government from the legislative and executive arms
by restricting the
judicial power of the Commonwealth to the High Court and any
other courts established pursuant to Chapter 3. This very specific
constitutional framework makes the adaptation of the general principles to the
Victorian situation very difficult.
57 In a unanimous decision that the disciplinary Board in question was at all
times exercising administrative power, the Chief Justice,
Justice Gleeson (with
Gummow, Hayne, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ) in the Joint Judgment, and
Justice Kirby made a number of comments
of relevance to the Board’s
consideration.
58 In a joint judgment, their Honours relevantly commented:
in paragraph
[16], quoting Kitto J in
R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte Tasmanian
Breweries Pty Ltd
[1970] HCA 8
(1970) 123 CLR 361 (Tasmanian
at 374-375, the Court accepted as an
accurate description of the civil judicial function as "determining a dispute
inter partes as
to the existence of a right or obligation in law and in applying
the law to the facts as determined". In analysing the
Tasmanian Breweries
decision, at paragraph [27], they quoted the court with approval when it
said "(I)ndeed, a tribunal may find it necessary to form
an opinion as to the
existing legal rights of the parties as a step in arriving at the ultimate
conclusions on which the tribunal
bases the making of an award intended to
regulate the future rights of the parties [
R v Gallagher
[1987] HCA 29
(1987) 163 CLR
140 (Gallagher)
at 149]. Of course, the formation of
such an opinion does not bind the parties and cannot operate as a binding
declaration of rights";
in paragraph
[28], the Court agreed with the submission that the disciplinary Board was
required to form an opinion as to existing
rights, but "that was no more than a
step necessary to its ultimate conclusion. This was whether, in terms (of the
relevant section
of the Act under consideration) the performance of duties or
functions required by Australian law had been carried out or performed
‘adequately and properly’";
in paragraph
[29], the Court agreed with the Full Court of the Federal Court (the decision it
was reviewing), when it said:
"If one takes the exercise of power here - that is to terminate or
suspend a right or status, created by statute, by reference, in
part to past
conduct - it can readily be accepted that a court might do this or an
administrative tribunal might do this. This is
not a power which is inherently
judicial. The character of the Board, the undoubted bringing to bear by the
Board of professional
standards..., an absence of an assigned task of deciding a
controversy between parties as to the existence or not of present mutual
and obligations of those parties upon the application of the law to past events,
the exercise of an evaluative and discretionary
power in the protection of the
public as to whether a person is fit and proper to continue to hold a
position..., all combine to
give the conclusion that the conferral on the Board
of the power in (the section) is not judicial."
59 In considering the High Court's joint judgment comments, the Board noted
that, by contrast with the disciplinary Board the court
was reviewing, it is
required to make a decision which ultimately binds the parties as to the
involuntary patient's rights under
the Act, on every occasion that it conducts a
review or appeal hearing, in that its determination continues involuntary status
discharges patients from involuntary status, directly impacting on their
rights and the responsibilities of the treating service.
60 The very nature of the Board’s jurisdiction reviewing what are often
serious episodic illnesses, subject to recurring acute
exacerbations and
remissions of symptoms, explains why, on a regular basis, discharge decisions -
whether by the authorised psychiatrist
or the Board on review - are followed by
new decisions to place patients on involuntary treatment orders or community
treatment orders,
which trigger a further review by the Board. Such situations
in no way invalidate previous decisions - whether by the authorised
psychiatrist
or the Board on review - but simply reflect the complexity of serious mental
illness and the course of its treatment
cycle. None of this, however,
diminishes the importance of the different roles of the authorised psychiatrist
as clinical director,
and the Board as independent external review body, in
undertaking their statutory functions under the Act.
61 Kirby J also made a number of relevant comments:
at paragraph
[57], his Honour observed that "(G)iven the rapid expansion of the number, type
and variety of decisions that have to
be made..., often having deleterious
consequences for natural or legal persons, it is necessary to have some concept
of the decision-making
functions that, of their character, are reserved to the
courts, so as to distinguish them from those that are not. To identify those
functions, it may be useful, though not determinative, to have regard to
considerations of history, analysis of typical judicial
activities and an
understanding of the reasons given by this Court in deciding such questions in
noting that the
High Court's decisions “afford a general description of what is involved
in ‘judicial power’, in
the context of the Australian
Constitution”, this requirement "reserves that ‘power’ to the
determination of controversies
by application of legal norms" (paragraph [73]).
His Honour went on to note (in paragraph [74]) that it was simpler to identify
"the functions that are alien to federal judicial power". In paragraph [77], in
respect of submissions made to the Court by the
appellant, His Honour conceded
that the cases "presented questions of degree" and that no feature of the
section under consideration
"conclusively demonstrated that it involved an
exercise of federal judicial power. Nor did he argue that the Board's functions
any features apt to the exercise of administrative, as distinct from
judicial, power. He simply submitted that the combination of
functions reposed
in the Board disclosed an exercise of the judicial power...".
in drawing a
conclusion about the functional analysis, at paragraph [98], His Honour quoted
the court in
[1977] HCA 62
(1977) 138 CLR 1 (Quinn)
at 11 that the historical approach to the question is based upon the recognition
that the federal system of law and government "has
traditionally protected the
rights of persons by ensuring that those rights are determined by a judiciary
independent of the parliament
and the executive. But the rights referred to...
are the basic rights which traditionally, and therefore historically, are judged
by that independent judiciary which is the bulwark of freedom".
62 Notwithstanding the difficulties of adaptation, the Board
considered that, consistent with Kirby J’s analysis, in conducting
or appeal hearings, it determines the status of involuntary patients in a manner
that fundamentally affects their rights as
citizens and their freedom to live
their lives free of constraints imposed by the Act. This places its
decision-making firmly within
the realm of "the basic rights" traditionally
determined by an independent judiciary. Added support for this view is provided
the fact that, in many Western democratic and legal jurisdictions such as the
Netherlands and many states in the USA, courts, rather
than tribunals, authorise
or review involuntary detention or treatment under equivalent mental health
legislation. The fact that,
in England, Scotland, New Zealand and most
Australian States, parliaments have seen fit to transfer this important
decision-making
function from the general courts and give it to specialist
tribunals does not in any way detract from the basic and inherent character
the underlying decision-making as essentially judicial, or, in the case of the
Board, quasi-judicial in nature.
63 Finally, the Board compared its decision-making powers under the Act with
the "classical" model of merits review of administrative
actions and decisions
in Victorian and Commonwealth arenas. Under the Act, as noted above, the Board
makes determinations with the
direct and binding effect on the parties before
64 The inherent character of these powers is directive, in the same manner as
court orders. In the Board's view, they represent to
all intents and purposes
an exercise of quasi-judicial power, not administrative power. Further support
for this view is derived
from the fact that the Board conducts a legal hearing,
rather than clinical process, unlike the authorised psychiatrist, to arrive
its determination, and, irrespective of what order the Board makes, it at no
stage stands in the shoes of the authorised psychiatrist
as regards clinical
responsibility for the patient's treatment. In reaching the Board’s
determination, s22(2) of the Act requires
it to “have regard primarily to
the patient's current mental condition and consider the patient medical and
psychiatric history
and social circumstances”. This clearly demonstrates
that the Board is not standing in the shoes of the original decision
is not reviewing the clinical decision made to commence (and maintain)
involuntary status, but is making a fresh decision
on the day of the hearing.
If the Board’s powers were to be categorised as in the nature of
administrative powers, it would
be expected that the Board would have all the
powers of the authorised psychiatrist, and that its statutory obligation would
review, albeit on the merits, the initial decision made by the authorised
psychiatrist to commence involuntary treatment of a person
under the Act.
65 A confirmation that such an analysis misconceives the character of
Board’s decision-making powers in a hearing requires only
to contrast the
wording of the Act in respect of the Board's decision-making powers with the
powers given to VCAT in undertaking
its review jurisdiction under the
Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal
Act). By s51(1)(a), VCAT "has all the functions of the decision-maker", making
it clear that VCAT stands in the shoes of
the original decision-maker. Under
subsection (2), the decision-making powers of VCAT are expressed very
differently from the Board’s,
and in a manner similar to many other merits
review administrative tribunals, including a number of Commonwealth tribunals.
It provides:
(2) “In determining a proceeding for review of a decision the Tribunal
may, by order –
(a) affirm the
decision under review; or
(b) vary the
decision under review; or
(c) set aside
the decision under review and make another decision in substitution for it;
(d) set aside
the decision under review and remit the matter for reconsideration by the
decision-maker in accordance with any directions
or recommendations of the
66 In essence, the Board considered that the clear
intention of such a provision is to enable VCAT, in appropriate circumstances,
to conduct a review of the decision of the original decision-maker, rather than
to make a fresh decision directly affecting the parties.
As an example, where a
public servant has a duty to make decisions about an application under freedom
of information legislation,
such a decision may be subject to an internal review
by a senior public servant in the same organisation, who likewise has similar
options to those provided to VCAT by s51(2). However, the process will be
strictly administrative, with none of the trappings of
a quasi-judicial hearing
or decision. In such a case, on application to VCAT, VCAT’s review
undertakes its review function under s51 - a
true merits review of an administrative action or decision - in which it
exercises administrative,
rather than quasi-judicial, power, notwithstanding its
inherent status as a tribunal.
67 Having said that, it is noteworthy that, when VCAT reviews decisions of
the Board, pursuant to s120 of the Act, in fact it conducts
a de novo hearing in
much the same manner as the Board does. It is therefore less clear whether, in
that capacity, VCAT is exercising
administrative or quasi-judicial power. This,
however, is not a matter of concern to the Board in this instance.
68 On the basis of the above analysis of the Board’s functions and
powers under the Act, and consistent with s4(1)(j) of the
Charter, the Board
reaffirmed its previous view that, in undertaking its hearing function, it is a
tribunal, but not a public authority,
for Charter purposes. As a result, it
adopted its previous analysis in paragraphs [138] – [158], and restated
paragraph [158]
in which the Board set out the direct consequences of the Board
being a tribunal for Charter purposes:
"158. Therefore, from 1 January 2008, the Board considers that the following
are the direct consequences of the Board being a tribunal:
The obligations
concerning interpretation of legislation in s32 apply to the Board. (ss2 and
6(2) of the Charter).
The Board may
refer a question of law concerning the Charter to the Supreme Court in
accordance with s33. The Board has a similar
power under s118 of the Act.
The Board has no
power to make a declaration of inconsistent interpretation, this power being
limited to the Supreme Court under Charter
s36, and is not bound by a statement
of compatibility (Charter s28(4)).
In cases where
it is required and able to do so in order to apply the Act, the Board must make
a Charter-consistent interpretation
of relevant provisions of the Act or other
relevant legislation (for example, the
Sentencing Act 1991
As the Board in most cases is concerned with the application of statutory
criteria to an involuntary patient, this interpretive
obligation is likely to be
limited to specific cases where the interpretation of the meaning of specific
provisions of the Act is
The Attorney
General and the Victorian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission have the
right to intervene in, or be joined
as a party to, Board proceedings in which a
question of law arises that relates to the application of the Charter, or a
arises with respect to the interpretation of a statutory provision in
accordance with the Charter (ss34 and 40).
For the reasons
discussed above, until determined otherwise, the Board considers itself bound by
s24 of the Charter which obliges
it to provide parties before the Board with a
fair hearing. In effect, this Charter right appears to reinforce the
obligation under the Act (s24(1)(b)) to act in accordance with the
principles of natural justice, although it is unclear as to the
extent to which
the application of this section may require the Board to make changes to its
hearing procedures, practices and processes."
69 As a result of its decision in this case, to these consequences
must now be added the following:
In undertaking
its hearing function, the Board is not bound to comply with or apply s38, as it
is not a public authority for Charter
The Relationship between the Charter and the Act in relation to
the Board’s s32 Interpretive Function and its Decision-making
70 Having clarified its role as a tribunal, but not a public
authority, the Board confirmed its previous position articulated in
that it has no direct power under the Charter to:
determine the
consistency or compatibility of the Act, or any provisions of the Act, with the
declare that
particular decisions or actions of area mental health services breach Charter
rights [152].
71 The Board also confirmed that, when required to interpret the
Act’s provisions, this may involve the formation of views about
consistency or compatibility of one or more of the Act’s provisions with
the Charter. In essence, though, this process
does not change the Board’s
substantive decision-making role under the Act [153].
72 It noted the more problematic issue it previously considered [154-157]
concerning the meaning and application of s6(2) of the Charter
in respect of its
functions (which term is defined in s3(2) to include “a reference to a
power, authority and duty”),
if any, under Part 2, the provisions of which
contain the protected Charter rights. As regards its “functions under
the Board confirmed that, in its decision-making function as a
tribunal, it is limited to the application of those Charter rights
that directly
relate to the conduct of its hearings. In effect, this means that the Board is
bound to consider the s24 fair hearing
73 Turning to the vast majority of Board hearings, the role of the Board is
one of deciding mixed questions of fact and law. This
involves it gathering
evidence, making findings of facts, and applying the s8(1) criteria for
involuntary treatment to a particular
patient who is the subject of the hearing.
Direct arguments or competing issues relating to statutory construction of
sections of
the Act have been relatively rare. It is clear that the Charter may
lead to the Board reconsidering some of its previous interpretations,
result of issues raised in cases such as this one. However in practical terms,
when determining the application of the s8(1)
criteria to the facts of
individual cases, the Board has no specific power in relation to the application
of the Charter or interpretation
of a statutory provision, except in the sense
that an involuntary patient's Charter rights are one of the many factors that
weighs up to determine whether particular criteria are or are not met.
74 Section 32(1) provides:
"So far as it is possible to do so consistently with their purpose, all
statutory provisions must be interpreted in a way that is
compatible with human
75 As it discussed in
, its understanding of this important
interpretive function of courts and tribunals is that, irrespective of there
being any ambiguity
in the language of a statutory provision in the Act, the
Board is required to make every reasonable effort to interpret the Act's
provisions in a way which is compatible with Charter rights (see
Godin-Mendoza
[2004] UKHL 30 (Ghaidan)
, paragraphs
32-33, 44-50, 59-76, and 106-124). This is subject to the Charter’s
express limitation, namely "so far as it is
possible to do so consistently with
(the Act’s) purpose", and in accordance with any general limits under
s7(2) of Charter
or expressed in a particular Charter right. In so doing, the
Board may consider, but is not bound by, relevant international
jurisprudence.
76 In undertaking this task in that case, the Board followed guidance adapted
from Canadian and New Zealand authorities (
[1986] 1 SCR 103
Hansen v The Queen
[2007] NZSC 7
), adopting a logical and stepped approach as
a practical decision-making framework to follow. Under this five-step approach,

the wording or the purpose of the Act will not permit the Charter-consistent
interpretation, adopted the current interpretation
despite its inconsistency
with the Charter. Further, in this situation, the Board must consider whether
there are other courses
of action that should be followed to bring the
inconsistency to attention in the appropriate quarters.
77 Since the Board’s previous decision in
Nettle JA discussed the proper approach to statutory construction under s32 of
the Charter in
RJE v Secretary to the Department of Justice
[2008] VSCA
, a decision handed down on 18 December
2008. Although he agreed with the other two judges (Maxwell P and Weinberg JA)
meaning to be given to the words in the section at issue, unlike his
colleagues, Nettle J’s approach to the task of statutory
construction
involved some analysis of the impact of the Charter on statutory
interpretation.
78 His Honour rejected the approach of Elias CJ in the New Zealand case of
preferring to follow the approach of Lord Woolf CJ in
Poplar Housing and Regeneration Community Association Ltd V. Donoghue
[2001] EWCA Civ 595
[2002] QB 48 (Poplar)
79 In paragraph [114], Nettle JA quoted Lord Woolf (Poplar paragraph
"It is difficult to over estimate the importance of Section 3 (of the United
Kingdom Human Rights Act). ... When the court interprets
legislation usually
its primary task is to identify the intention of Parliament. Now, when section
3 applies, the courts have
to adjust their traditional role in relation to
interpretation so as to give effect to the direction contained in section 3.
and went on to state: "I see no reason to doubt that the same is true of
s32". He then outlined the additional directions concerning
the application of
s3 given by Lord Woolf (supported by Lord Steyn in
R v A (No 2)
at paragraph [44]):
"the following points which are probably self-evident, should be noted.
(a) Unless the legislation would otherwise be in breach of the Convention
section 3 can be ignored (so courts should always first
ascertain whether,
absent section 3, there would be any breach the convention).
(b) If the court has to rely on section 3 it should limit the extent of the
modified meaning to that which is necessary to achieve
compatibility.
(c) Section 3 does not entitle the court to
(its task is
still one of
interpretation
, but interpretation in accordance with the
direction contained in section 3).
(d) The views of the parties and of the Crown as to whether a
‘constructive’ interpretation should be adopted cannot
task of the court (if section 3 applies the court is required to adopt the
section 3 approach to interpretation)."
80 In the Board’s view, at this stage in the development of the case
law on s32, it is required to follow the approach suggested
by Nettle JA,
notwithstanding any debate about the benefits of following the potentially more
far-reaching approaches adopted overseas
(based respectively on
). As a result, the Board’s understanding of the
approach is that interpretation of a statutory provision compatibly with human
rights should be considered in the event that there is some ambiguity or
prima-facie incompatibility identified, otherwise the ordinary
principles of
statutory construction would be applied.
81 Notwithstanding that, the Board was satisfied that its five-step approach
outlined in paragraph 76 above and previously endorsed
can continue to be
applied to assist it to undertake its statutory construction task, with a minor
modification to step 2 (highlighted
in italics):
2. Identified how the relevant provisions of the Act, and their current
interpretation, would apply to the issue under consideration
, including
whether any ambiguity or potential inconsistency with Charter rights can be
. If there is a match with the rights and implications identified
in step 1, the Act and Charter appear consistent.
3. The Relevance of the Charter to the Authorised Psychiatrist and Area
Mental Health Services
82 Before addressing and determining those important issues, a further issue
arose in the course of the arguments presented during
the hearing, namely
whether the authorised psychiatrist (and, by implication, staff employed by area
mental health services) is a
"public authority" for the purposes of the Charter.
It was the subject of brief oral submissions, supplemented by later written
submissions.
83 In essence, it was argued on behalf of P that the authorised psychiatrist,
together with those acting under his or her authority
under the Act, is a public
authority, whereas it was argued on behalf of the treating services that they
84 In summary, Mr Moglia submitted to the following reasons in support of his
mental health
services and the authorised psychiatrist are funded from the public purse, they
perform functions conferred by statutory
provisions, they exercise powers
necessarily affecting and restricting a person's human rights, involuntary
treatment of mentally
ill persons is a matter of high public interest, the
definition of "public authority" should be interpreted widely, and the
characterisation
of a body as "private" is of little importance;
acknowledging that questions of funding and the exercise of statutory power are
not determinative [Charter s4(2) and (3)],
they are centrally relevant;
referred the
Board to a number of cases including
YL v Birmingham City Council
[2007] UKHL 27
1 AC 95 (YL)
R, A v Partnerships in
Care Limited
[2002] EWHC 529 (Admin)
(Partnerships)
, reinforcing the importance of issues
such as public interest, functions of a public nature, the authority or control
of the State
or special powers as determining factors and, in
Aston Cantlow v
,[2004] 1 AC 546 (
increasing reliance of private bodies performing public functions, indicating
that the public-private split whilst important
cannot alone be determinative of
85 In her written submissions [24 November 2008, para 33], Ms Doyle
submitted that "the Board has no power to conclusively determine,
nor does it
need to determine in the circumstances this case, whether the approved mental
health service or the authorised psychiatrists
are public authorities to the
purpose of the Act" (sic). She went on to strongly argue that a number of the
matters, including many
raised by Mr Moglia, such as the receipt of public
funds, the fact that the authorised psychiatrist is employed by the State and
has some powers under the Act could not in themselves be determinative of the
86 At paragraph 37, she suggested that neither is an entity established by a
statutory provision that has functions of a public nature
[Charter s4(1)(b)],
nor are they entities whose functions include functions of a public nature which
are being exercised on behalf
of the State or a public authority [Charter
87 In summary, her position was that none of these "features are sufficient
to transform the authorised psychiatrist or the mental
health services into
public authorities" [para 39]. The basis of the argument was expressed in the
same paragraph in the following
"the relationship between the authorised psychiatrist and the patient
involves treatment provided in line with applicable medical
standards. The
fact that certain functions are, in addition, conferred on the psychiatrist
pursuant to the
Mental Health Act
does not convert the authorised
psychiatrist’s relationship with the patient into one which is regulatory
or governmental
in nature. The fact that he is employed by a body in receipt
of public funds is not capable of having that effect either".
88 Ms Doyle relied heavily on the majority decision in
, noting that
the provision of care and accommodation to the aged by a private company on
behalf of a local council was determined
not to be an inherently public function
and therefore fell outside the scope of the equivalent section of the United
Human Rights Act 1998
. Mr Moglia pointed out that, subsequently,
the majority decision has been criticised in many quarters.
89 Ms Doyle illustrated her basic submission with the example of a union
representative with powers under the
Occupational Health and Safety Act
to issue a statutory notice to an employer, stating that "it could not be
suggested that by so acting the union official is exercising
functions on behalf
of the state or exercising regulatory functions or functions connected with or
identified with the functions
of government such as to render him or her a
public authority for the purposes of the Charter."
90 In the course of the discussion, the Board raised with Ms Doyle the
question of coercion and its impact on the question. She took
the view that its
mere presence also could not be determinative, suggesting that private prisons
may or may not be public authorities.
Are authorised psychiatrists and area mental health services public
authorities for Charter purposes?
91 The Board agreed with Ms Doyle that
it is not empowered or required to determine the issue of categorising the
authorised psychiatrist
or area mental health services for Charter purposes.
Nonetheless, it considered that it is important to express a view on this
This is because it is fundamental to the relationships that the Board
must deal with in every hearing, namely those between the
psychiatrist and members of the treating teams of area mental health services on
the one hand, and involuntary patients
under the Act on the other hand. In this
regard, the Board also considered it important that those people charged with
statutory functions under the Act fully understand how, if at all, the
Charter may impact on their work and their decision-making
pursuant to the
92 The Board was unable to agree with Ms Doyle’s submission which,
focusing as it did on the fact that no one indicia or factor
determinative of the point, appeared to misconceive the combined impact of all
the indicia or factors to which she pointed
the Board. Notwithstanding the
medical context of the appointment of the authorised psychiatrist, it appeared
clear to the Board
that the many factors discussed, when taken together, all
support the argument that the authorised psychiatrist and members of treating
teams employed by area mental health services are public authorities for the
purposes of the Charter, rather than the opposite conclusion.
Board’s view, they are therefore bound under s38 to act and make decisions
compatibly with the Charter rights of involuntary
93 There was much discussion of the relevant factors in determining this
question, together with analysis of the relevant case law,
by all the Lords in
the leading House of Lords decision of
, to which the Board was
referred by both parties. Despite the split decision as to how to categorise
them, there appeared to be
broad agreement as to what the key factors to be
considered are when determining whether a function is of a public nature. Lord
Bingham [in para 4ff] quoted with approval Lord Nicholls in
stated that it was "appropriate to give a generously wide scope to the
expression ‘public function’" [
para 11], and that
"there is no single test of universal application to determine whether a
function is of a public nature. A number
of factors may be relevant, but none
is likely to be determinative on its own and the weight of different factors
will vary from
case to case". [
94 Lord Bingham then listed and discussed what he considered to be the
relevant factors including the nature of the function in question,
the role and
responsibility of the State in relation to the subject matter in question, the
nature and extent of the public interest
in the function, the nature and extent
of any statutory power or duty in relation to the function, the extent to which
directly or indirectly, regulates, supervises and inspects the
performance of the function, whether the funding to perform the function
directly or indirectly paid by the State, and the extent of the risk that
improper performance of the function might violate an
individual's human rights.
[paras 6-11]
95 Having carefully considered the submissions put to it and the relevant
case law, in this case, the Board considered that the relevant
sections 5 and 6
of the Act respectively set out the objectives of the Department (of Human
Services) and the functions of the Secretary
of the Department. These include,
among others, establishing mental health services which provide high-level care
and treatment
to people with a mental disorder and support people with a mental
disorder in the community. In facilitating "the provision of care,...(and)
treatment... of people with a mental disorder", under ss95 and 97, the Secretary
may employ doctors and staff, effectively on public
sector employment
conditions;
approved mental
health services are proclaimed under s94 of the Act as premises at which
treatment is to be provided, and the services
through which treatment is to be
provided, to patients, including involuntary patients. In effect, treatment
services to treat the
mental illness of involuntary patients cannot be provided
other than at approved mental health services and by staff employed in
services. Likewise, the use of the coercive powers authorised by the Act is
limited to these services and their staff. Approved
area mental health
services, although largely operationally autonomous, are State or public sector
bodies, almost entirely State
funded, and are answerable for their performance
to the State through the Secretary and Chief Psychiatrist (itself a statutory
appointed under the Act). Implicitly, approved mental health services
can employ nurses and other allied health staff to carry out
their statutory
responsibilities;
under s96, the
Secretary or the governing body of an approved mental health service must
appoint an authorised psychiatrist, who,
subject to the general direction and
control of the Secretary, has "such powers, duties, functions and immunities as
are conferred
or imposed upon the authorised psychiatrist by and under (the) Act
or any other Act". The authorised psychiatrist has a wide power
of delegation
to qualified psychiatrists, generally those leading treating teams, and a
limited and temporary power of delegation
to registered medical
practitioners;
area mental
health services and their staff are funded from the public (health) budget, and
the proper provision and use of public
funds for health purposes is always a
matter of significant public interest;
the provision of
treatment services for people with a serious mental illness by public area
mental health services constitutes a State
responsibility and, in the context of
the objects of the Act, is clearly a public function in the sense that it is a
function exercised
not only for the benefit of the individuals receiving
treatment, but also for the benefit of their families and society in general,
a manner similar to the provision of general health services by public hospitals
and their staff;
the authorised
psychiatrist and staff of area mental health services exercise a range of
specific powers conferred or imposed by the
Act, including coercive powers which
directly impact on the rights of involuntary patients; the minority in
clearly identified coercion as an important indicia of State
responsibility:
"62 The contrast is drawn in the Act between "public" functions and
"private" acts. ... The contrast is between what is "public" in
the sense of
being done for or by or on behalf of the people as a whole and what is "private"
in the sense of being done for one's
own purposes.
63 Hence it is common ground that "functions of a public nature" include the
exercise of the regulatory or coercive powers of the
state. ... Again, it is
common ground that privately run prisons perform functions of a public nature.
In a similar category are
private psychiatric hospitals when exercising their
powers of compulsory detention under the Mental Health Act 1983. ... This is
even though the power to detain rests with the hospital managers rather than
with a state body by whom it has been delegated."
(per Baroness Hale)
majority implicitly appeared to concede this point:
"28 The position might be different if the managers of privately
owned care homes enjoyed special statutory powers over residents
entitling them
to restrain them or to discipline them in some way or to confine them to their
rooms or to the care home premises."
(per Lord Scott)
"166 ... it is of particular importance in relation to the issue which we
have to decide that a proprietor of a care home is not given
significant, or
indeed (as far as I am aware) any, coercive or other statutory powers, over its
residents. ... If proprietors had
such powers, that would be a powerful reason
for justifying the conclusion that a function was ‘public in
nature’." (per
Lord Neuberger)
the range of
powers and services provided by the authorised psychiatrist and staff of area
mental health services is considerably
wider than (medical) "treatment provided
in line with applicable medical standards", as Ms Doyle suggested. The fact
that, in the
future, it may be determined that discrete transactions involving
direct medical treatment in a one-on-one doctor-patient relationship
between the
authorised psychiatrist, or any other medical person employed by the service,
and an involuntary patient fall outside
the categorisation of "public authority"
for Charter purposes in no way negates the general position that, in undertaking
their statutory
responsibilities under the Act, the authorised psychiatrist and
staff of area mental health services are acting as public authorities
acting and making decisions under the Act. For example, in considering any
treatment or other decisions under the Act which
rely on coercive practices,
such as restraint, seclusion, electro-convulsive therapy without informed
consent, and enforced injections
of medication, among other matters, the
authorised psychiatrist must take account of the human rights of the
96 In the Board's view, all these factors, taken together, clearly
support the conclusion that the authorised psychiatrist and staff
employed by
area mental health services are public authorities for Charter purposes. It
follows from this conclusion that it is
essential for the authorised
psychiatrist and management of each area mental health service to provide
appropriate and ongoing training
for staff in relation to human rights and their
obligations as public authorities under the Charter. Most importantly, all
staff employed by area mental health services must understand that they
are required to appropriately observe and implement Charter
rights, and comply
with the requirements of s38 of the Charter to act and make decisions compatibly
with the Charter rights of their
patients, including involuntary patients.
Equally, the Secretary and the Department ought be obliged to adequately fund
and facilitate
that appropriate and ongoing training across all Victorian
services to facilitate this understanding.
4. The meaning and application of “cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment” in s10(b) of the Charter
97 This Charter interpretation issue, specifically identified in the
application lodged with the Board on behalf of P, was the subject
of detailed
oral submissions, particularly on the first day of hearing, supplemented by
further written submissions, provided by
both parties, together with many case
references in support of the arguments. Not surprisingly, most of the relevant
case law was
from comparable overseas jurisdictions including the United
Kingdom, European Union, United States of America, Canada and New Zealand.
98 There was considerable detail and complexity in the arguments and the case
analysis, which greatly assisted the Board in its understanding
of the issues
and developing its own analysis to arrive at its conclusions on the issues.
What follows is a summary of the key aspects
of the arguments, and the Board's
findings and decisions on them.
Framework of the Charter right in s10(b)
99 The Board considered
the submissions of the parties in the context of the medical and clinical
evidence it heard, and the evidence
of P and his mother, KH (summarised below).
It noted that, subjectively, P said he felt humiliated by receiving the weekly
Provera injection, although it was unclear whether this was specifically
of osteoporosis.
100 In order to answer the fundamental issue raised by Mr Moglia, it required
the Board to make a number of legal decisions (by the
chairperson) and factual
findings (by the Board as a whole) on a series of the important and related
101 The first issue to determine was the proper interpretation of the
specific wording and context of s10(b) and (c) within the Charter.
required a comparison with other international instruments, including Article 7
of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights
which it was based. Much argument ensued over this point and the Board was
referred by both parties to a number of international
case authorities to
support their competing arguments.
102 Below is the actual wording of the relevant comparative provisions:
Charter s 10:
"A person must not be-
(a) subjected to torture; or
(b) treated or punished in a cruel, inhuman or degrading way; or
(c) subject to medical or scientific experimentation or treatment without his or
her full, free and informed consent."
ICCPR Article 7:
"No one shall be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment. In particular, no one shall be subjected
without his
free consent to medical or scientific experimentation."
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms Article 3:
"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment".
The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms clause 12:
"Everyone has the right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual
treatment or punishment"
New Zealand Bill Of Rights Act 1990 s9:
"Everyone has the right not to be subjected to torture or to cruel, degrading
or disproportionately severe treatment or punishment".
United Kingdom Human Rights Act 1998 Schedule One, Article 3
"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment".
United Nations Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental
Illness and the Improvement of Mental Health Care (Mental Illness
Principles -
General Assembly Resolution 46/119 - 17 December 1991)
103 This international instrument specifically was designed to recognise and
protect the rights of people with a mental illness.
Although none of the
principles have the same wording as s10(b) of the Charter, several of the
principles are relevant, namely Principle
1, clauses 3 and 5, Principle 8,
clause 2 and Principle 25. Taken together, these principles provide protection
from exploitation,
physical or other abuse and degrading treatment (Principle 1,
clause 3), and from harm, including unjustified medication (Principle
2). Principle 25 saves all existing rights recognised by international and/or
domestic law.
Ambit of the s10 Charter
104 The Board acknowledged the history helpfully outlined by Ms
Doyle in her oral and written submissions, noting – as Mr Moglia
conceded - that the majority of decisions on the point have involved issues of
punishment and treatment within a variety
of penal and quasi-penal contexts.
Among the case authorities cited by Ms Doyle, a number involved early decisions
of United States
courts on alleged violations of the "cruel and unusual
punishment" prohibition within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment to the
States Constitution. While these were helpful in providing historical context,
they were of little direct assistance to the
interpretive task facing the
105 More recent authorities from the United Kingdom and Europe were more
directly relevant, but limited by the differences in the
wording of the various
statutory provisions. The Board must consider the Charter, not its overseas
equivalents. As can be seen
by the arguments made to the Board, this is not
necessarily a straightforward process.
106 What was generally agreed by the parties, and accepted by the legal
member, as relevant to the proper interpretation of s10 of
the Charter, were the
following four propositions:
subject to the
specific limitation in the wording of s32 of the Charter that it do so "so far
as it is possible to do consistently
with their purpose", the Board must
interpret the criteria for involuntary treatment, the treatment plan provisions,
and all other
provisions of the Act in a manner consistent with P’s human
the Board may
consider, but is not bound by, relevant international jurisprudence;
to fall within
the scope of s10, treatment must meet a "minimum level of severity", and the
standard is high, involving principally
a question of degree and intensity:
For example, in
R v Secretary of State for the Home Department
ex parte Adam
[2005] UKHL 66 (Adam)
[para 7 per
Lord Bingham]:
"(T)he treatment, to be proscribed, must achieve a minimum standard of
severity, and I would accept that in a context such as
this, not involving
the deliberate infliction of pain or suffering, the threshold is a high
Menesheva v Russia
(2006) App No 59261/00
(Menesheva)
, the European Court accepted [para 58]
"(T)o assess the severity of the "pain or suffering" inflicted on the
applicant, the Court has regard to all the circumstances of
the case, such as
the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, as in some
cases, the sex, age and state of
health of the victim... ."
a measure which
is a therapeutic necessity generally cannot be regarded as inhuman or
Herczegfalvy v Austria
(1992) App No 10533/83, 24
September 1992 (Herczegfalvy)
[para 82], the European
Court stated, in a passage later approved by the House of Lords in
"the established principles of medicine are admittedly in principle
decisive in such cases; as a general rule, a measure which
is a therapeutic
necessity cannot be regarded as inhuman or degrading. The Court must
nevertheless satisfy itself that the
medical necessity has been convincingly
shown to exist."
107 In advancing his argument for a broader ambit of the s10 rights, Mr
Moglia made the point that
Herczegfalvy
involved an Article 3 analysis
in a psychiatric hospital
108 What the parties did not agree on was the extent or ambit of the right,
the relationship between the rights recognised by the
different sub-sections of
s10, and how the agreed principles should be applied to the facts of P’s
case. They also disagreed
if so, how s7(2) of the Charter, the so-called "proportionality test"
109 In making her primary submission, Ms Doyle relied on the history of the
development of the right by international courts and the
split between the two
subsections (b) and (c) to separate out medical rights or contexts from penal
rights or contexts. She suggested
that the Act and the CTO provisions are not
in conflict with s10(b) rights. Whilst this is no doubt generally true, as Mr
himself conceded, the issue raised by this case was whether, in the
particular circumstances of the case, provisions of the Act may
be in conflict
with Charter rights. The Board was not persuaded that the structure of the
rights recognised in s10 limit the ambit
of s10(b) in the way Ms Doyle
110 In considering these competing issues, clearly, in the Board’s
view, the case law has developed over many years into a wider
situations and contexts. The legal member considered, as the law stands today,
that Ms Doyle's primary submission can no
longer be sustained, and that there
are persuasive precedents to support Mr Moglia’s submission that there can
no longer be
a reasonable distinction drawn in law between the application of
the right to penal detention situations on the one hand and quasi-penal
other situations involving an element of compulsion, including involuntary
treatment under the Act, on the other hand. Under
the Act, the State, in the
form of the authorised psychiatrist and members of treating teams employed by
area mental health services,
can exercise compulsion or control over involuntary
patients such as P to the extent that they are incidental to the provision of
treatment for his mental illness. Indeed, its power to do so is complementary
to the exercise of its express obligation under the
Act to provide treatment to
P while he is involuntary patient.
111 While conceding that it is most commonly raised in the context of penal
situations, taking into account the background provided
by the application of
the equivalent international human rights instruments, the legal member
determined that the right recognised
in s10(b) can be applicable in a broader
context than in relation to prisoners’ rights or penal or quasi-penal
contexts or
situations. This can include situations involving involuntary
medical treatment under the Act.
112 Examples of cases involving government decisions raising similar issues
outside the penal context in support of the conclusion
of the legal member
cited by both parties - required the House of Lords to consider the
circumstances in which the United Kingdom Secretary of State
was required under
immigration legislation to provide support to an applicant for asylum, in the
context of a specific statutory
provision which effectively refused support to
applicants who failed to claim asylum "as soon as reasonably practicable after"
arrival in the UK. This resulted in each of the applicants being forced
to live in unsupported circumstances which, they claimed,
constituted inhuman or
degrading treatment.
In unanimously determining that such treatment can be inhuman or
degrading, the Court made several important observations:
"7 ... Treatment is inhuman or degrading if, to a seriously detrimental
extent, it denies the most basic needs of any human being.
... A general
public duty to house the homeless or to provide for the destitute cannot be
spelled out of article 3. But I have
no doubt that the threshold may be
crossed if a late applicant with no means and no alternative sources of
support, unable to support
himself, is, by the deliberate action of the state,
denied shelter, food or the most basic necessities of life. ...
8 When does the Secretary of State's duty... arise? The answer must in my
opinion be: when it appears on a fair and objective assessment
relevant facts and circumstances that an individual applicant faces an imminent
prospect of serious suffering caused
or materially aggravated by denial of
shelter, food or the most basic necessities of life. Many factors may affect
that judgment,
including age, gender, mental and physical health and condition,
any facilities or sources of support available to the applicant,
the weather
and time of year and the period for which the applicant has already suffered
and is likely to continue to suffer privation.
..." (per Lord Bingham)
"46 ... The (article 3) prohibition is in one sense negative in its effect,
as it requires the state ... to refrain from treatment
of the kind it
describes. But it may also require the state or the public authority to do
something to prevent its deliberate
acts which would otherwise be lawful from
amounting to all-treatment of the kind struck at by the article.
47 The fact that an act of a positive nature is required to prevent the
treatment from attaining the minimum level of severity which
engages the
prohibition does not alter the essential nature of the article. The
injunction which it contains is prohibitive and
the prohibition is absolute.
If the effect of what the state or the public authority is doing is to breach
the prohibition, it
has no option but to refrain from the treatment which
results in the breach. This may mean that it has to do something in order
bring that about. ..." (per Lord Hope)
Bensaid v UK
(2001) App No 44599/98, 6 February 2001 (Bensaid)
- cited without name or reference by Mr Moglia - required the European Court to
consider article 3 in the context of an Algerian
national applicant suffering
from a serious psychotic illness, the symptoms of which were such that
consideration was given to compulsory
psychiatric treatment under the English
equivalent of the Act. After a series of rejected applications, the applicant
was granted
indefinite leave to remain in the UK as a foreign spouse.
Subsequently, he visited Algeria and returned to the UK seeking leave
as a returning resident. Following a temporary admission, he was subjected to
an expulsion decision. He applied for judicial
review on the basis that it
would cause a full relapse of his mental health problems and would amount to
inhuman or degrading treatment
contrary to article 3.
On the facts of the case, the Court accepted the seriousness of the
applicant's medical condition, but it did not consider that all
circumstances met the high threshold set by article 3, particularly where the
case does not concern the direct responsibility
of the Contracting State for the
infliction of harm. In rejecting that "there is a sufficiently real risk that
the applicant's removal
in these circumstances would be contrary to the
standards of" the article, and that “the case does not disclose the
exceptional
circumstances of”
D v United Kingdom
(2 May 1997
the Court stated:
"37 ... the Court considers that the suffering associated with such a
relapse (of symptoms of the mental illness) could, in principle,
fall within
the scope of Article 3."
In respect of the general point about the broadening of the contexts within
which the Court would consider breaches of Article 3,
it observed:
"34 While it is true that Article 3 has been more commonly applied by the
Court in contexts in which the risk to the individual of
being subjected to any
of the proscribed forms of treatment emanates from intentionally inflicted acts
of the public authorities
or non-State bodies in the receiving country ... , the
Court has, in light of the fundamental importance of Article 3, reserved to
itself sufficient flexibility to address the application of that Article in
other contexts which might arise. It is not, therefore,
prevented from
scrutinising an applicant's claim under Article 3 where the source of the risk
of proscribed treatment in the receiving
country stems from factors which cannot
engage either directly or indirectly the responsibility of the public
authorities of that
country, or which, taken alone, do not in themselves
infringe the standards of that Article. To limit the application of Article
in this manner would be to undermine the absolute character of its
protection."
application of John Wilkinson v Broadmoor Hospital
[2001] EWCA Civ
1545(Wilkinson)
R on the application of B v Dr
[2005] EWHC 1936 (Admin)
neither case being directly referred to in argument before the Board - required
respectively the Court of Appeal and a single
High Court judge to consider
whether, and in what circumstances, compulsory treatment of a patient under the
UK Mental Health Act
may constitute inhuman or degrading treatment:
"78 ... one can at least conclude from this (analysis of key
comments in
Herczegfalvy
) that forcible measures inflicted upon an
incapacitated patient which are
a medical necessity may indeed be
inhuman or degrading. The same must apply to forcible measures inflicted upon a
capacitated patient.
83 ... the decision to impose treatment without consent upon a protesting
patient is a potential invasion of his rights under Article
3 ... ." (Wilkinson
per Hale LJ)
In the Dr SS case, His Honour, Justice Charles, found on the evidence and in
the circumstances of the case that "it is unlikely that
the compulsory
administration of anti-psychotic medication will result in intense physical or
mental suffering to Mr B" (para 202)
and concluded "(I)n my view it is unlikely
that the compulsory administration of an antipsychotic to Mr B will result in
of severity to engage Article 3 being reached." (para 202) He also
concluded that the evidence had "convincingly shown" that the
proposed treatment
was a therapeutic or medical necessity under the
Herczegfalvy
Relationship between s10(b) and s10(c)
113 Mr Moglia submitted that
there should be no different interpretation of the section when compared with
other international instruments
because of s10(c), as s10(c) is relevant to the
issue of consent only, and is already dealt with under the Act and effectively
from by the use of ITOs and CTOs.
114 In his written submission, Mr Moglia, in relation to the statutory
construction of ss10(b) and (c) of the Charter, asserted that
the term "treated"
in "treated and punished" in (b) relates to different subject matter compared
with "treatment" in "medical or
scientific experimentation or treatment" in (c)
- (b) relating to the effects of treatment and harm, whereas (c) relating to
- but that both can apply to medical treatment. In effect, he argued
that the term is used more broadly in (b), but its use in (c)
does not diminish
this wider ambit.
115 Ms Doyle argued that the Charter split of Article 7 rights between s10(b)
and s10(c) was a deliberate acknowledgement of the distinction
between treatment
in the punishment context [(b)] and treatment (as opposed to experimentation in
Article 7) in the medical and scientific
context [(c)], and that the Charter
right recognised in s10(c) is not engaged by P as there is no direct challenge
to his involuntary
status; as it is, the Act balances the interests of patients
against involuntary treatment where the s8(1) criteria are met.
116 She noted the different terminology employed in various international
instruments and legislation, including New Zealand which
also splits the Article
7 rights but into separate sections, and relied on the decision in
[1997] NZFLR 978
to support her
contention about how s10(c) must work under the Charter.
117 Ms Doyle's argument was superficially attractive. However, the case she
, was of limited assistance. It was a decision of the
New Zealand Mental Health Review Tribunal made in late 1997 in the context
the complaints procedure laid down in the New Zealand mental health legislation.
In considering whether the treating doctor had
breached the applicant's rights
by treating her with Lithium while pregnant, the Tribunal also considered her
human rights under
the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, but did not appear
to provide a clear decision as to its applicability in MP’s case.
case resolved on the facts found that the treating doctor did not breach the
statutory requirement to provide appropriate medical
treatment, but the
discussion was primarily concerned with MP’s right and capacity to give
informed consent, and to receive
information about her treatment, as well as the
responsibility under the New Zealand legislation for the doctor to seek the
of the patient’s principal caregiver.
118 Having carefully considered the competing arguments, the legal member
agreed with Mr Moglia’s submission that, notwithstanding
the different
formulation and articulation of rights equivalent to those in Article 3 of the
European Convention and Article 7 of
the ICCPR, the right recognised in s10(c)
has a more limited and different ambit from the right relevant to P’s case
in s10(b). Nor, in the legal member's view, does s10(c) limit the
ambit of the s10(b) right, as Ms Doyle suggested. The reason
conclusion is a simple reading of the wording of each subsection within the
Charter section.
119 The limitation inherent in the term "medical or scientific
experimentation or treatment" to either the medical or the scientific
relation to obtaining informed consent is unsurprising given the sometimes
tragic history of forced experimentation and
treatment in the name of medical
and scientific advancement. One only has to think of Nazi Germany, early
efforts at psychosurgery,
and certain drug and other treatment trials as
well-known and infamous examples.
120 Whilst the historical context of s10(b) is clearly penal, developing case
law has now taken it outside that context to a range
of contexts involving
elements of government coercion, mental health treatment included, as is
articulated above. The ambit of the
prohibition has therefore expanded, and
this expansion is, in the legal member's view, unaffected by the additional
right recognised
Medical or Therapeutic Necessity
121 Mr Moglia argued that there
was a requirement for the State to convincingly show that the treatment is a
medical necessity, especially
where it imposes on a person's rights, but even so
a therapeutic intervention can be cruel, inhuman or degrading, and its
characterisation
as a therapeutic intervention does not automatically save the
conduct from being cruel, inhuman or degrading. In assessing the level
severity - a composite concept - required for it to be considered cruel, inhuman
or degrading, all the facts must be considered,
not just the level of
impairment.
122 He went on to suggest that Depo Provera is not provided to directly treat
P’s mental illness, but to prevent future offending
or manage the risk of
behaviour specifically excluded within s8(2) of the Act, and that alternative
treatments have not been explored.
123 He asserted that the harm to P arises from a "deliberate" act, as the
treatment is administered deliberately, and osteoporosis
is a known side-effect
which has been brought to the attention of the services. In these
circumstances, it cannot be considered
accidental, and even non-deliberate harm
can offend against the right (
). Degrading treatment includes
treatment that humiliates and debases, but this does not need to be the purpose
of the treatment
to be within the ambit of the prohibition. [
Jalloh v Germany
(2006) App No 54190/00 (Jalloh)
124 In her alternative argument, and as a fallback position, Ms Doyle argued
that, if the Board were to decide that s10(b) can be
applicable, it ought
determine that P’s medical treatment does not fall foul of the section,
based on international jurisprudence
that the treatment provided to P cannot be
considered cruel, inhuman or degrading because of its therapeutic aim. This, in
creates a higher standard of severity before it could be considered
cruel, inhuman or degrading and, in any case, the case law suggests
standard of severity would need to be much higher.
125 Ms Doyle also made it clear that, in her view, the therapeutic benefits
of P’s treatment outweigh the adverse side-effects,
and that the symptoms
for which the treatment is being provided are referable to P’s mental
126 The Board accepted that, as a general principle, a measure which is a
therapeutic necessity cannot be regarded as cruel, inhuman
or degrading, based
Herczegfalvy
test, and that it must nevertheless satisfy itself
that the medical necessity has been convincingly shown to exist. Despite the
fact that, with psychiatric illnesses, it can be very difficult to be certain
and any underlying
illness pathology, in this case, the Board considered that the
Herczegfalvy
test was satisfied.
127 The clear weight of the medical evidence before the Board was in favour
of the conclusion that P’s symptom of the sexual
disinhibition or
inappropriate sexualised behaviour, however described or defined, is more likely
connected with the diagnosed mental
illness of paranoid schizophrenia than other
proposed causes including brain injury, intellectual disability or substance
Whilst all the psychiatrists and clinicians from both services who gave
evidence conceded that it is difficult to be completely
certain, they were
unanimous in supporting this view. The best articulation of the evidence, which
the Board ultimately accepted,
was given by Dr AM and by Dr DSu.
128 Therefore, on the face of it, the prescription of Depo Provera to treat
that symptom of the mental illness appeared to the Board
to be for a legitimate
therapeutic purpose. To the extent that it does - and the balance of the
medical evidence about the three
separate occasions when the dosage of Depo
Provera was reduced supports the conclusion that it does - reduce this
particular symptom,
it is no less legitimate than the prescription of
antipsychotic medication to reduce more commonly described psychotic symptoms
paranoia, delusions, and hallucinations. That its prescription also acts
to prevent possible future offending or to manage the risk
of potentially
offensive behaviours does not change its essential therapeutic purpose in this
case, nor make it significantly different
from other more regularly prescribed
medication treatments for people with a serious mental illness.
129 This finding is also consistent with the definition of "treatment" in the
Act, as the Board accepts that the prescription of Depo
Provera is being given
to treat one particular symptom of P’s mental illness in the exercise of
the professional skills of
members of both treating teams in an effort to
"lessen (the) ill effects or the pain and suffering" [s3] which P’s mental
Level of Severity
130 Notwithstanding its finding in respect of
medical or therapeutic necessity, the Board was also required to consider the
of severity of the side-effects of the treatment, as it accepted Mr
Moglia’s contention that even a therapeutic intervention
can potentially
constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and its characterisation as a
therapeutic intervention does not
automatically save the conduct or treatment
from being in breach of the person's right.
131 The legal member accepted as an accurate statement of the law which the
Board must apply, namely:
to fall within
the scope of s10, treatment must meet a "minimum level of severity", and the
standard is high, involving principally
a question of degree and intensity
]. Consistent with Lord Bingham’s observation [para 7]:
"(T)he treatment, to be proscribed, must achieve a minimum
standard of severity, and I would accept that in a context such as
involving the deliberate infliction of pain or suffering, the threshold is a
test provides an appropriate statement of the assessment
process, namely:
"(T)o assess the severity of the "pain or suffering" inflicted on
the applicant, the Court has regard to all the circumstances of
the case, such
as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, as in some
cases, the sex, age and state of
health of the victim... ." [para 58]
132 The evidence before the Board was that P subjectively feels a sense of
humiliation as a result of his compulsory treatment. However,
the Board was
unable to accept that this subjective sense was any greater than it would expect
for any involuntary patient being
treated under the Act against their will, and
especially when the treatment involves the prescription of medications that the
does not like or wish to have, and those medications have unpleasant and
unwanted side-effects.
133 The more fundamental issue raised by the evidence was the potential for P
to suffer considerable physical harm because of the
reduction in bone density
resulting from his current mental health treatment. The weight of medical
evidence supported the conclusion
that the long-term prescription of Depo
Provera medication was the major cause of osteoporosis in P, and that his
current risk of
fracture is eight times that of a normal male of equivalent age.
However, there was also evidence, albeit less clear, that antipsychotic
medication also potentially increases the risk of a reduction in bone density,
and that any alternative anti-libido medication such
as Androcur is likely to
have an impact on P’s bone density similar to Depo Provera.
134 There was also evidence that, ever since the original prescription of
Depo Provera in 2001, successive treating teams have been
aware of the potential
development of osteoporosis, and, to a reasonable extent, have addressed
P’s concerns in this regard.
This has included obtaining advice from
Forensicare, bone density scans and expert advice, and the prescription of
Fosamax and calcium
supplements specifically for the purpose of countering the
reduction in bone density. They have also considered, and on three separate
occasions attempted, a reduction in the dosage of Depo Provera, but on each
occasion have reinstituted a higher dose as a result
of observations by members
of treating teams of behaviour indicating a return of sexual disinhibition or
inappropriate sexualised
135 The Board, however, noted that it was the recommendation of Dr DSu that a
trial reduction in dosage is best attempted in an inpatient
setting, and that
there appeared to be a misunderstanding of the relationship and responsibilities
between the treating team and
P’s GP. As is discussed below, in the
Board's view, as the side-effects of the treatment being provided for the
symptoms of
P’s mental illness are serious, deleterious and potentially
permanent, the treating team cannot resile from its responsibility
to ensure a
co-ordinated, seamless and consistent treatment plan that ensures P the highest
level of treatment and care reasonably
practicable to avoid the potentially
harmful consequences of the side-effects of the prescribed treatment under the
current treatment
136 Mr Moglia raised the difficult issue of P’s legitimate rights
(recognised in the Charter in ss 13 and 17) to privacy and
family, including
looking after his own legitimate sexual needs, and ultimately his right to found
his own family. Whilst these
Charter rights were not argued before the Board,
there is a potential that they could be engaged in P’s circumstances.
issues were not specifically addressed, but the Board noted that, whilst
most treating teams refuse to countenance these matters
within their normal
treatment protocols, as Dr DSu conceded in his evidence, circumstances such as
P’s may call for a range
of creative solutions to address the issues.
137 Turning to its consideration of the assessment of the severity of the
"pain or suffering" inflicted on P, the Board acknowledged
the difficulty, both
clinically and legally, in applying the relevant standard to P’s factual
situation. Whilst Mr Moglia
was critical of the approach taken by the treating
teams, the Board accepted that they had at all times taken the side-effect risks
to P extremely seriously, and had sought and acted on external expert advice
from Forensicare and other relevant specialist services.
In the Board's view,
they had at all times attempted to act in P’s best interests.
Notwithstanding that, the Board formed
the view that there were flaws in the
development and implementation of the current treatment plan that required
further review and
revision in an effort to ensure as far as reasonably
practicable that P is protected from harm resulting from the prescribed
138 In addressing the level of severity issue, the Board considered that the
most helpful guidance to it, and the treating teams,
was that provided by the
House of Lords in
, albeit in a different context, namely:
Treatment is inhuman or degrading if, to a seriously detrimental
extent, it denies the most basic needs of any human being.
When does the Secretary of State's duty... arise?
The answer must
in my opinion be:
when it appears on a fair and objective assessment of

"46 ... The (article 3) prohibition is in one sense negative in its effect,

injunction which it contains is prohibitive and
the prohibition is absolute.
If the effect of what the state or the public authority is doing is to
the prohibition, it has no option but to refrain from the
treatment which
results in the breach. This may mean that it has to do
something in order
to bring that about.
..." (per Lord Hope)
(Board’s emphasis)
139 In this case, there was clear evidence of the serious, detrimental and
potentially permanent effects of the current treatment
P is receiving on his
bone density, directly as a result of the medications prescribed by the treating
team. What is therefore required
by the treating team in these circumstances,
as Lord Bingham suggests above, is a "fair and objective assessment of all the
facts and circumstances" to determine the point at which P "faces an
imminent prospect of serious suffering caused or materially
aggravated by" the
continued treatment under the current treatment plan. On the Board’s
analysis of the evidence below, it
considered that, in P’s case, the
balance between therapeutic benefits of the treatment on the one hand, and the
serious, deleterious
and potentially permanent side-effects on the other hand,
is already a delicate or fine one. Therefore, considerable care and attention
to this assessment is required on a very regular basis. At the point at which,
clinically, the balance tilts such that the side-effects
start to outweigh the
therapeutic benefits, then the treating team must act "to prevent the treatment
from attaining the minimum
level of severity which engages the prohibition", as
Lord Hope explains above.
140 Even with the benefits of the prescription of Fosamax and other
supplements - and acknowledging that these benefits might be improved
review and revision of the treatment plan to ensure that they are taken by P
exactly as prescribed so as to maximise their
beneficial effects - it is
undeniable that the serious and deleterious physical effects on P’s bone
density have been noted
over the years since the first prescription of Depo
Provera in 2001. With the lack of reliable base evidence of his bone density
prior to this commencement, the evidence lacked certainty about the extent of
the deterioration in his bone density and the beneficial
impact of the Fosamax
in holding or reversing the deterioration. The Board considered this to be an
absolutely crucial aspect of
the monitoring required to minimise the potential
harm to P, and therefore it is an essential element of treatment plan which
regular review and revision to ensure consistent bone density scans and
expert advice on no less than an annual basis.
141 Given the Board’s consideration that further deterioration of
P’s bone density could foreseeably cross the line to
breach his s10(b)
Charter right to be protected from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,
consideration will be regularly required
of the many other relevant factors
alluded to by the Law Lords, including P’s increasing age, the state of
his physical and
mental health (including the effectiveness of treatment of his
psychotic symptoms), and the practical day-to-day support of the treating
to maximise his capacity to take the dose of Fosamax and the other supplements
exactly as prescribed in an effort to minimise
the development of osteoporosis,
and to maximise his capacity to function in the community and live a reasonably
happy and fulfilling
142 Having so determined, the Board is at pains to reinforce to the treating
teams the essential importance of closely monitoring
every aspect of P’s
mental health treatment, including all treatments provided for consequential
physical health issues, whether
by his GP or other external specialists, or
members of the treating team. This responsibility is onerous, and will
potentially
become increasingly onerous, the longer a similar treatment plan
remains in place. Clearly, it is incumbent on the treating team
being placed at such a level of risk that in the future he may suffer an actual
fracture or a permanent physical disability
resulting from the osteoporosis.
143 The difficulty for the Board, and, more importantly, the treating team,
is to specify at what point the current treatment plan
may be considered to
reach the minimum level of severity so as to breach P’s Charter rights.
This was a point repeatedly made
by Mr Moglia when questioning members of the
treating teams. While assistance can be gained from the international
jurisprudence,
the determination ultimately rests with the treating team and its
expert external advisers such as Dr ML and DSu on the basis of
their close and
regular monitoring of P’s physical and mental health and the factual
information available to them, including
a regular, reliable and consistent bone
density testing regime. This demands constant and well co-ordinated
consideration by the
treating team of the efficacy of treatment on P’s
mental health, and the impact of the side-effects on P’s physical health
at a level far more intense than would be routinely provided to involuntary
patients. This is because, the Board accepts, if the
State’s treatment
becomes cruel, inhuman or degrading, it must desist notwithstanding a continued
view that there continue
to be therapeutic benefits of the treatment. At the
point at which the therapeutic benefits on a fair and objective assessment no
longer outweigh the adverse side-effects, the treatment plan will require
significant change.
Gravity of Risk
144 Mr Moglia argued that the effective treatment
of P is disproportionate to the gravity of risk sought to be avoided, as,
to the actual 2001 charges and penalty, there is no evidence of
(criminal) conduct by P "of the gravest kind". This argument was
based around whether the symptoms for which the treatment is being provided are
referable to P’s mental illness.
As discussed above, the Board has
decided that they are, and that the current treatment is therefore presently
justifiable under
145 However, further comment should be made, and may be of assistance to the
services in this and other similar cases. In this case,
it has been noteworthy
the extent to which the treating teams have sought and relied on expert advice
from Forensicare. Notwithstanding
this, there appeared to be considerable
confusion, as Mr Moglia effectively highlighted, among the staff about the
seriousness of
P’s offending history. In the Board's view, much of this
was the result of variations and inconsistencies in the reporting
"stories" underpinning the history of P’s sexually disinhibited and
inappropriately sexualised behaviour. This was
true both in relation to the
offences for which he was originally charged and eventually convicted and
punished, and his actions
and behaviour during the periods when different
treating services were attempting to reduce the dose of Depo Provera.
146 Mr Moglia rightly highlighted that the gravity of risk must properly be
assessed, in determining the appropriate treatment response.
Whether the use of
Depo Provera, or similar anti-libido medications, should be limited to only
those offenders of the gravest kind
is a matter beyond the Board’s
consideration. However, in its view, it is a matter that the treating team must
factor in to
its rights-based decision-making about an appropriate treatment
plan. Dr DSu explained that there is one other alternative treatment
would reserve for offenders at a far more serious level than P, and that oral
alternatives such as Androcur would be preferred
in the absence of compliance
147 Without in any way underestimating the advice given by Dr DSu to the
services, the Board highlighted the fundamental importance
of weighing, and
continually reassessing, the gravity of risk in cases such as P’s. As
time goes on, such a reassessment should
inevitably lead to a reconsideration of
a reduction strategy for the dosage of Depo Provera or the instigation of
alternative treatments,
including other anti-libido medications such as
Androcur. As advised by Dr DSu, and conceded by Mr Moglia, this may require P
temporarily be placed in a more restrictive inpatient setting for the
purposes of ultimately reducing the restrictions inherent in
his long-term
mental health treatment in the community. Again, these are matters for timely
and appropriate clinical consideration
and decision-making, with P’s
rights as one of the factors to be balanced.
Whether s7(2) applies to s10 rights
148 Mr Moglia argued that, as
far as limitations on the s10(b) right under s7(2) are concerned, the State
cannot derogate from this
fundamental right to be free from cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment, indicating that it is not subject to proportionality, as
treatment is either cruel or not and that, if it is, it cannot occur at the
hands of the State. He noted that s7 is a catch-all
limitation and
proportionality section, but proposed that each right under the Charter creates
different limitations, and in each
case a judgement as to how much derogation
and how to deal with the proportionality issue is required.
149 He was adamant that, based on international jurisprudence, in respect of
the s10(b) right, there should be no derogation, as otherwise
the State could
justify cruel treatment or punishment, which is different from other more
flexible rights such as privacy rights.
He conceded, appropriately in the
Board's view, that the right recognised in s10(c) does not apply to P, as it is
dealt with under
the Act and can be derogated by involuntary orders.
150 In his written submission, Mr Moglia suggested that the criteria in s7(2)
cannot be considered equal, and that it is implicit
in the proportionality
analysis that some criteria are of more importance and cannot be overridden by
the other criteria. He gave
as his example the fact that the nature of the
right under s10(b) is conceded on behalf of the services to be very important,
suggested that the international jurisprudence supports the view that it is
a right from which there can be no derogation, as it
so fundamental that its
nature overwhelms the other criteria.
151 By contrast, in her argument as a final fallback position, Ms Doyle
contended that, if the Board were to decide that the treatment
of P with Depo
Provera could constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, s7(2) of the
Charter should be applied and the Board
should determine that this constitutes a
justifiable limitation on P’s rights in this case, in order to provide
necessary medical
treatment and the best available care in the least restrictive
manner within the context of the Act. Further, in her view, it did
foul of the very high standard required to be characterised as treatment
breaching the right.
152 Ms Doyle did not accept Mr Moglia’s argument that s7(2) applies to
some rights but not others, asserting that the Charter
would have been specific
if it did not apply to any particular right, in this case s10(b). She conceded
that, when considering s7(2)(a),
the s10(b) right is a very important right, but
argued, relying on the other s7(2) criteria and the proportionality analysis in
, that the delicate balance struck in the context of the Act
supported the treatment as being a justifiable limitation on P’s
right under s10(b).
153 With respect to Mr Moglia, the Board could not agree with his argument.
The framing of Article 3 in the context of the European
Convention is entirely
different from the framing of the Charter rights in Part 2 and the place of s7,
in particular s7(2). As a
matter of statutory construction, the legal member
decided that there is nothing in s10 to suggest that it should be treated any
differently from the other rights, although doubtless international
jurisprudence which, in relation to other international instruments
treated similar rights as absolute, supports the view that, when undertaking the
proportionality analysis required by s7(2),
the starting point must be that a
very high degree of justification would be required to set any reasonable limits
to the s10 rights.
Previous Board Determinations regarding "Treatment" under the
154 In considering the Board’s obligation to interpret the
provisions of the Act compatibly with Charter rights, it reviewed
Board’s many previous statements regarding aspects of treatment under the
Act. However, it formed the view that there
was nothing in the Board’s
previous interpretations that, applying the ordinary principles of statutory
interpretation, were
inconsistent with the submission made on P’s behalf
or, indeed, his rights under the Charter, including his right under s10(b).
155 Therefore, in principle, the Board agreed with the submission that any
interpretation of the s8(1) criteria and the requirements
of s19A and s35A with
regard to treatment plans should define the relevant terms so as to mean
treatment which is not cruel, inhuman
or degrading. Further, the Board agreed
that it should interpret the provisions regarding preparation, review and
revision of a
person’s treatment plan in s19A and s35A consistently with
human rights such that the authorised psychiatrist must consider
the effect of a
person’s treatment on their human rights, specifically the rights under
section 10 of the Charter.
156 As noted above, treatment is defined in s3 of the Act to mean:
“...things done in the course of the exercise of professional skills
(a) remedy the mental disorder; or
(b) lessen its ill effects or the pain and suffering which it causes.”

Re the review of RD (1997) 2 MHRBD (Vic) 425
The Board adopted the following approach in determining whether or not
immediate treatment was required:

(2) the possible severity of relapse; and
(3) the degree of disruption a relapse would be likely to cause should the
patient immediately cease medication.
Citing an earlier 1994 decision of the Board, the Board observed:
“The Board must decide whether treatment, including medication and
compulsory attendance at the clinic, needs to be given directly
and without
delay. In deciding whether immediate treatment is required, the positive
benefits of treatment, and particularly medication,
must be weighed against the
patient’s negative attitude to involuntary treatment, particularly
medication. We must assess the

The Victorian Administrative Appeal Tribunal made it clear that “(I)t

161 It is unsurprising that, even before the commencement of the Charter, the
Board was concerned about the balance between therapeutic
benefit and
detrimental side-effects, both in terms of the physical effects on the patient
of a particular treatment, usually medication
see PX above
patient's attitude, usually negative, to involuntary treatment (quotation, as
). Indeed, in virtually all its previous decisions made
by the Board in relation to P, different divisions of the Board focused
significant
attention on this issue specifically in relation to the prescription
of Depo Provera and the development of osteoporosis.
162 To quote but one example, which is representative of a number of similar
decisions, in decision 07-008 (unreported, MHRBD (Vic)
7 July 2006)
, in its analysis of P’s treatment plan
at the time, the Board discussed at length the s19A requirements. In response
to submissions
and concerns surrounding P’s lengthy treatment with Depo
Provera, that division of the Board noted:
"Although not defined in the Act, the Board concluded that by the use of the
words “health or well-being”, section 19A(2)(c)
contemplates (that)
... “well-being” can include a range of matters relevant to that
patient such as, but not limited
to, their health, safety and quality of life.
In the Board’s view section 19A(2)(c) allows the Board to consider a
range of matters including the whole of the treatment,
the aim of the treatment,
the balance between therapeutic and effective treatment and any negative side
effects, and how the planned
treatment affects the patient’s mental and
physical health, their safety and quality of life. That is, it was appropriate
consider whether, on balance, the proposed treatment as a whole had the
objective of promoting and maintaining a patient’s
overall health or
well-being.
In P’s case, this was complex given the history of his mental illness,
behaviours which had resulted in a criminal conviction
in the past and the side
effects of the medication, in particular the continuing use of Depo Provera. The
Board concluded that the
treating team had considered P’s history and took
into account past treatment, the opinions and recommendations contained in
report by Dr P of Forensicare, the serious physical side effects of his current
treatment and P’s physical and mental state
over time. ... The Board was
satisfied that P’s treatment was designed only to promote and maintain
P’s health or well-being.
This conclusion also led the Board to be satisfied, for the purpose of
section 19A(2)(d), that the treatment plan as implemented by
the treating team
took into account alternative treatments for P, including attempts to reduce the
dose of Depo Provera, analysis
of previous attempts to cease this medication,
and changes to his anti-psychotic medication.
The evidence of the treating team was that they were cognisant of the side
effects and risks associated with the current treatment.
They had arranged
appropriate specialist referrals to monitor and advise on treatment for
P’s conditions and the Board was
satisfied that this met the requirement
that the authorised psychiatrist take into account the matters in section
19A(2)(e)."
163 Looking to P’s future, in the Board’s view, the Charter
provides a clearer rights focus to the various considerations
that, in the past,
the Board has indicated are relevant to its decision-making task of applying
criteria specified in the Act, including
the s19A criteria in respect of the
preparation, revision and review of treatment plans. This Board would add to
the checklist provided
by the Board in
above in respect of the
matters relevant to whether treatment is "only to promote and maintain the
patient's health or well-being"
both the protection of the patient's Charter
rights in general, and the likelihood that the treatment may become or be
characterised
as cruel, inhuman or degrading in particular.
5. Impact of the Charter on the Board’s Interpretation of the
Section 7(2) and the proportionality analysis
164 Having arrived at
the determinations explained above, the Board undertook its five-step analysis,
as outlined above in paragraph
76 and modified in paragraph 81:
Charter rights relevant to the issue under consideration and their
implications.
165 The issue argued before the Board in this case was whether the
medical treatment P is receiving under the current treatment plan
raises, and
potentially breaches, his Charter right under s10(b), namely that the treatment
could constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment. The basis of the
argument was that, as a result of the regular prescription of Depot Provera, an
anti-libido medication,
since 2001, a direct side-effect has been the reduction
in P’s bone density such that currently his spinal readings confirm
he has an eightfold risk of spontaneous fracture in comparison with a person at
the median of the normal range of the population
of equivalent age.
166 As the arguments developed during the hearing, on its own analysis, in
the context of his right to a normal sex life and the capacity
to found his own
family, the Board considered that, potentially, P’s rights under s13 (the
right not to have his privacy, family
... unlawfully or arbitrarily interfered
with) and s17 (families are the fundamental group unit of society, which are
entitled to
protection) might be relevant to the issue under consideration.
167 As the above discussion, and the medical and clinical evidence below,
illustrate, there is considerable complexity in determining
the factors relevant
to identifying the point at which medical treatment which, on the basis of
proper and appropriate application
of current medical knowledge, is considered
by the treating team to be required in P’s best interests to treat his
condition of paranoid schizophrenia, including the symptom of sexual
disinhibition which has led to inappropriate, and potentially
sexualised behaviour, can cross the line from therapeutic necessity to cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment.
168 Notwithstanding that practical difficulty, the Board accepted that there
is a genuine potential for medical treatment for a mental
illness to constitute
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in the event that the side-effects of
treatment are of such a serious,
deleterious and potentially permanent nature
that, on a fair and objective assessment, they could outweigh any therapeutic
derived from the treatment by the patient.
how the relevant provisions of the Act and their current interpretation would
apply to the issue under consideration, including
whether any ambiguity or
potential inconsistency with Charter rights can be identified. If there is a
match with the rights and
implications identified in step 1, the Act and Charter
appear consistent.
169 It was argued on behalf of P that the Board should interpret
the involuntary treatment criteria provisions in s8(1) involving
"treatment" and the treatment plan provisions in s19A and s35A of the Act in a
manner consistent with his s10(b) right.
According to their argument, there is
potential for inconsistency between the Act and this Charter right.
170 The Board’s analysis of its previous interpretations of the term
"treatment" noted that, essentially, the Board’s
focus has been on
defining the term in relation to the health consequences for involuntary
patients. Accordingly, as discussed above,
the Board did not consider that
those interpretations appear in any way inconsistent with the argument put on
behalf of P.
171 In its detail analysis of the application of the requirements of the
s10(b) right to P’s treatment situation, the Board
determined that it was
in broad agreement with the interpretation suggested on P’s behalf.
Notwithstanding that the treating
services strongly argued that, in their view,
the provisions of the Act could not be in conflict with s10(b) for reasons with
the Board did not entirely agree, there was no suggestion from the
treating services that they opposed the basic interpretation premise
proposed on
P’s behalf.
172 Therefore, as regards its interpretation of the relevant provisions in
sections 8(1), 19A and 35A, in respect of the terms "treatment"
and "treatment
plans", the Board determined that there is consistency between the provisions of
the Act relating to treatment and
treatment plans in each of the sections and
Charter rights, including most importantly s10(b). The Board considered that
the treating
services continue to be justified in their treatment of P’s
mental illness, including on an involuntary basis.
173 However, as is discussed below, in P’s case, the Board also formed
the view that, mindful of the potential Charter implications
on account of the
serious, deleterious and potentially permanent consequences of the direct
side-effect of the medication regime,
namely reduction in P’s bone
density, their statutory obligations under the treatment plan provisions require
the treatment
plan to be revised to specify a much more rigorous and carefully
planned outline of the relationship between, and responsibilities
for actions
and decisions concerning, the monitoring and treatment of the mental illness by
the treating teams and forensic specialists,
and the regular monitoring and
testing, and treatment, of P’s physical health consequences by external
treating agents including
his GP, Dr NH and bone density specialists.
174 The reason for the Board’s view is that, at a future point in time
- itself not easy to identify - there is potential for
the current treatment
plan to breach P’s s10(b) Charter right, in the event that the serious,
deleterious and potentially permanent
side-effects outweigh the therapeutic
benefits of the treatment. As far as reasonably practicable in order to protect
Charter rights and reduce the possibility that the continuation of the
treatment plan will lead at some point to a breach of the
Charter right, the
services in this case need to pay for much greater attention to the detail of
these obligations, specifying in
detail the liaison relationships and
responsibilities, and monitoring and testing regimes, whether under their direct
supervision
or the supervision of the relevant external treaters.
there is a discrepancy, assess whether the discrepancy is permitted by the
Charter as a reasonable limitation of the relevant right/s.
If so, the Act and
Charter appear to be consistent.
175 Given the decision at step 2, it was unnecessary to consider
this step. However, if the Board is incorrect in its conclusion
at step 2 that
there is no discrepancy between the Act and the Charter, the Board considered
whether, applying the s7(2) criteria
in the Charter, the provisions provide a
reasonable limitation on P’s Charter rights.
176 This question was the subject of considerable discussion by the legal
representatives in making their submissions, with a clear
disagreement in their
views. On behalf of P, Mr Moglia strongly argued that, based on international
jurisprudence mainly related
to the interpretation of Article 3 of the European
Convention, there can be no derogation of the right in s10(b). As a fallback
position, he argued that any application of the s7(2) would have a similar
result, as the nature of the right is so important and
fundamental that it would
overwhelm all the other s7(2) criteria. Ms Doyle argued that the Board should
consider P’s treatment
as a reasonable and justifiable limitation on his
Charter rights as the current treatment plan appropriately takes account of the
concerns regarding side-effects of the Depo Provera medication. This medication
is being prescribed to ameliorate a symptom referable
to his diagnosed mental
illness, and therefore is of therapeutic benefit.
177 The Board considered the s7(2) criteria:
“(2) A human right may be subject under law only to such reasonable
limits as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society based
on human dignity, equality and freedom, and taking into account all relevant
factors including—
(a) the nature of the right; and
(b) the importance of the purpose of the limitation; and
(c) the nature and extent of the limitation; and
(d) the relationship between the limitation and its purpose; and
(e) any less restrictive means reasonably available to achieve the purpose
that the limitation seeks to achieve.”
178 The Board noted the following factors support the view that the Act and
Charter appear to be consistent on the basis of the reasonable
and justifiable
limitation (or proportionality) argument:
(a) the nature of the right
179 Mr Moglia emphasised, and Ms Doyle conceded, the important and
fundamental nature of the s10(b) Charter right to protect Victorian
from State-imposed cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Mr
Moglia reiterated that, in international law,
this right is not derogable.
180 The Board accepted that this right is one of the highest order of rights,
along with, for example, the right to life, to be protected
as a fundamental
basis on which any free and democratic society should operate. Only in very
limited and specific circumstances,
and for very important reasons, would courts
and tribunals consider limiting this right, and then only in circumstances where
processes and procedures are in place to protect the person whose rights
are being limited.
(b) the importance of the purpose of the limitation
181 The Act
establishes a comprehensive legal framework to provide involuntary treatment to
people suffering from a serious mental
illness who refuse or are unable to
consent to necessary and adequate treatment for the mental illness.
International jurisprudence
has consistently confirmed that, in general, similar
regimes in themselves do not offend against the human rights of involuntary
patients, notwithstanding that there are inherent conflicts between a
patient’s right to, and the state's responsibility to
provide, treatment
for the mental illness and protection of the person's individual human
182 Although more than 20 years old, as indicated above, the Act provides
clear purposes, express statutory criteria and a range of
protections (including
appeal rights and regular independent external review by the Board) to underpin
the legal framework.
183 Subject to the discussion above regarding the proper diagnosis in
accordance with internationally recognised psychiatric practice
of a mental
illness of a level of seriousness and distress to justify involuntary treatment,
the ascertainment of a reasonable connection
between observed signs and symptoms
and the diagnosed mental illness, the proper assessment of necessary and
adequate treatment to
alleviate the symptoms of, or cure, the mental illness,
and the therapeutic benefit derived by the patient from the treatment provided,
the Board considered that limitations of rights pursuant to treatment provided
under the Act can be considered reasonable and justifiable
in a free and
democratic society.
(c) the nature and extent of the limitation
184 Having so decided,
in the Board’s view, this case highlighted an important rider to the above
discussion, namely the relationship
between the therapeutic benefits of
treatment and any side-effects of that treatment. In the event that the
side-effects in relation
to a particular involuntary patient become or are of
such a serious, deleterious and potentially permanent nature that they may
any therapeutic benefits derived by the patient from the treatment,
then, in the Board’s view, it is arguable that the treatment
under the Act can no longer be considered reasonable and justifiable in a free
and democratic society. At that point, although
difficult to predict or
ascertain, and taking account of all the circumstances of the case, the
treatment could potentially be considered
cruel, inhuman or degrading, and
therefore breach the patient's s10(b) Charter right.
(d) the relationship between the limitation and its purpose
The key to the determination of this relationship is the ongoing and proper (in
the words of Lord Bingham, "fair and objective")
assessment of the patient's
mental state, treatment needs and the positive and negative impact of the
treatment being provided under
the Act. In circumstances such as P’s,
where side-effects are known and potentially serious, deleterious and
potentially permanent,
in the Board's view, it is incumbent upon the authorised
psychiatrist and members of the treating team to provide and implement a
detailed treatment plan which carefully outlines the personnel, responsibilities
and liaison between elements of the treating team
(both internal and external)
to ensure that the patient's mental and physical health is protected so far as
is reasonably practicable
in the circumstances. In P's case, this includes a
requirement for regular, reliable and consistent monitoring and testing.
(e) any less restrictive means reasonably available to achieve the purpose
that the limitation seeks to achieve
186 The Board considered the fact
that, in practice, treatment of patients in the community under CTOs provides a
considerably less
restrictive treatment regime than involuntary detention in an
inpatient setting, and accordingly, in terms of the extent of the limitation
rights under s7(2) of the Charter, generally constitutes a less restrictive and
burdensome limitation on involuntary patients.
187 However, the Board agreed with Mr Moglia’s assertion that, at the
point at which on a fair and objective assessment, serious,
deleterious and
potentially permanent treatment side-effects start to outweigh the therapeutic
benefits of the treatment, then involuntary
treatment under the Act can no
longer be justified in a free and democratic society, even if provided in a
community context.
the limitation is not reasonable, but the wording of the Act, interpreted in
accordance with its purpose, can permit a Charter-consistent
interpretation,
adopt the new interpretation.
188 Given the decision at step 2, it was unnecessary to consider
the wording or the purpose of the Act will not permit the Charter-consistent
interpretation, adopt the interpretation despite its
inconsistency with the
Charter. Further, in this situation, the Board must consider whether there are
other courses of action that
should be followed to bring the inconsistency to
attention in the appropriate quarters.
189 Given the decision at step 2, it was unnecessary to consider
The Board’s interpretation of the Act in respect of P’s
involuntary status and treatment plan
190 In summary, therefore, in
response to the Charter argument outlined on behalf of P:
accepted that any interpretation of the criteria for involuntary treatment under
s8(1) of the Act must be consistent with
the Charter. Accordingly, the terms
“treatment” and “necessary treatment” must be defined so
as to exclude
treatment which is “cruel, inhuman or degrading” in
contravention of s10(b) of the Charter;
circumstances of P's case, the Board accepted that his treatment with Depo
Provera can constitute "necessary treatment",
or, in the words of
Herczegfalvy,
"a measure which is a therapeutic necessity" in the
circumstances that it is being provided specifically for the treatment of
which are more likely than not the result of the mental illness from
which he suffers;
to determine
whether the treatment in question is a therapeutic or medical necessity at any
point in P’s treatment cycle involves
a careful analysis – a fair
and objective assessment - by the authorised psychiatrist, based on the advice
of experts within
and outside the treating team, of P’s mental state,
symptoms and behaviour, current and potential risks to himself and others,
the side-effects and effects of the treatment on P and his mental and physical
health; in relation to the risk analysis, a realistic
assessment of the gravity
of the risk, based on past history and a proper, objective and reliable
assessment process, is fundamentally
the Board also
accepted that, in cases such as P’s where a known side-effect of treatment
may give rise to serious, deleterious
and potentially permanent physical health
or other consequences for the patient, treatment, including necessary treatment,
can potentially
constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, which must be
avoided by all reasonable means
circumstances of P's case, the Board accepted that considerable care and
attention to his treatment has been demonstrated
by the treating teams at both
Werribee Mercy and Inner West area mental health services, including the
appropriate concern to properly
manage the physical health concerns resulting
from the side-effects of the treatment for the mental illness, as well as the
management of his diabetes mellitis;
however, in
interpreting the provisions regarding the preparation, review and revision of a
person’s treatment plan under s19A
and s35A consistently with P’s
human rights, the Board accepted Mr Moglia’s submission that the
authorised psychiatrist
must consider the effect of P’s treatment on his
human rights, including his rights under s10(b) of the Charter;
circumstances of P's case, in particular in properly facilitating the
relationship between the treating team and external
treaters including his GP Dr
NH, and bone density and forensic specialists, Drs ML and DSu, the authorised
psychiatrist must specify
with a considerably greater level of detail on whom
the responsibility lies for monitoring all aspects of the mental health
and associated physical health treatments provided to ameliorate the
side-effects of the Depo Provera medication. This includes
the implementation
of very regular, reliable and consistent testing regimes. It was the
Board’s view that, inadvertently,
and probably largely as a result of the
transition of care from one area mental health service to the other, there has
been a lack
of effective liaison, and certainty as to the assignment of specific
responsibilities, between the treating teams and the external
treaters in
respect of the monitoring of, amongst other things, P’s capacity to
comply, and actual compliance, with the prescribed
a daily dose of Fosamax, and
in respect of regular, reliable and consistent testing of P's bone density. The
Board did not accept
the argument put on behalf of the services that, because
this medication was prescribed for a physical health issue, it was therefore
the service’s responsibility. If the service continues to take the view
that P’s treatment plan should include a
libido-inhibiting medication,
whether Depo Provera or a substitute, then the service must monitor all aspects
of the treatment prescribed
to reduce or ameliorate the impact of the treatment
on P’s physical health, in particular his bone density;
notwithstanding
that the treatment plan provisions of the Act require the authorised
psychiatrist to provide "an outline of the treatment
the patient is to receive"
[s19A(4)(a)], in the Board's view, the more serious and deleterious the
potential risks of treatment are,
a matter requiring specific attention under
s19A(2)(e), the more detailed and specific the outline in the treatment plan
in an effort to reduce the risks as far as is reasonably possible;
therefore the prescription of, and monitoring of the effective
compliance with, Fosamax and other relevant medications and supplements should
be expressly specified and outlined in
the treatment plan
evidence before the Board was that there was considerable uncertainty as to the
boundaries between the prescribing and monitoring
role of members of the
treating teams and GP Dr NH, and the regular review of P by external consultants
with various relevant specialties;
as a result, the
Board ordered the authorised psychiatrist to revise the treatment plan in
accordance with the discussion in this
statement of reasons.
REVIEW OF P’S INVOLUNTARY STATUS
191 Having considered the Charter issues and arguments, the Board proceeded
to conduct the review hearing.
INFORMATION CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD:
files of P – held by Werribee Mercy-Saltwater Clinic and Inner West-
Waratah Clinic.
on Involuntary Status dated 7 October 2008 prepared by the treating teams and
presented to the Board.
Plans of P dated 21 August 2008 and 7 October 2008, prepared by Mr SC and
presented to the Board.
4. Submissions and oral evidence at the hearing.
192 Under s36C(2), if the Board is satisfied that a person subject to a
community treatment order does not satisfy the criteria specified
in s8(1) , the
Board must discharge the person from the community treatment order. Therefore,
the Board considered:
P appear to be mentally ill; and
P's mental illness require immediate treatment and can that treatment be
obtained by making P subject to a community treatment
of P’s mental illness, is involuntary treatment of P subject to a
community treatment order necessary for his health
or safety (whether to prevent
a deterioration in his physical or mental condition or otherwise) or for the
protection of members
of the public; and
P refused or is he unable to consent to the necessary treatment for the mental
illness; and
P receive adequate treatment for the mental illness in a manner less restrictive
of his freedom of decision and action?
193 Under s35A, the Board must review the patient’s treatment
plan to determine whether:
authorised psychiatrist has complied with s19A in making, reviewing, or revising
the plan (as the case may be); and
plan is capable of being implemented by the approved mental health service.
DISCUSSION:
194 Dr AM examined P on 20 March 2008 and extended his
community treatment order for a period of 12 months. His day-to-day treatment
was in the process of being transferred from the responsibility of Saltwater
Clinic (Werribee Mercy area mental health service) to
Waratah Clinic (Inner
Western area mental health service) because of his recent move to live with his
P’s GP, Dr NH, provides medical services to P in relation to his
physical health issues, primarily his diabetes mellitus. At
the request of the
treating team, he also prescribes Fosamax in an effort to counteract the bone
density reduction caused by medications
prescribed to treat his mental illness.
Submissions
195 Both parties made a number of submissions about the
medical evidence at different stages during the hearing:
196 On 24 November 2008, in the context of the application of the
s8(1) criteria, Mr Moglia questioned how wide the Depo Provera treatment
extend and whether it could be considered a treatment for the mental illness.
He also raised issues around the capacity of
P to consent to treatment and
consideration of less restrictive treatment options.
197 He suggested that, at the strongest he could put the argument, there were
issues relevant to the review of P’s treatment
plan under s35A relating to
the matters required to be considered under s19A(2), particularly the basis for
the assessment of risk
regarding P, and whether sufficient and appropriate
procedures had been put in place to undertake risk assessments. This raised
issue of whether, overall, in that context, the risk assessment process imported
considerations of the s10(b) Charter rights.
198 Regarding the evidence to undertake the "pure s8(1) exercise", divorced
from considerations of the treatment plan, Mr Moglia noted
that the Board had
heard from P candid evidence, an acknowledgement of symptoms, and discussions
"no wholesale refusal of P to understand the
issues". He highlighted page 3 of the 2006 neuropsychological report which
that P was weak across the verbal domain in areas such as general
knowledge (below-average) and abstract verbal reasoning (borderline),
relevant to the Board's assessment about whether P can communicate his capacity
to identify symptoms and seek help especially
for a mental illness.
199 In summary, Mr Moglia asserted that the Board should note the evidence
that P has responded to the treatment, and acknowledged
symptoms, the support of
his carer KH whose evidence the Board has heard, and the evidence from the
treating team about his attendance
for and lack of refusal of treatment, all of
which relate to the consent issue.
200 On 9 December 2008, Mr Moglia addressed in more detail the criteria under
s8(1) and s19A. He submitted that the evidence of Dr
ML supported a conclusion
that the actual nature of the side-effects of Depo Provera treatment or their
consequences have led to
an extreme case of osteoporosis. The summation of the
evidence in relation to causation was such that the Board should be satisfied
that the treatment with Depo Provera was a direct or substantial cause, and that
the evidence of other possible causes, such as risperidone
or other medications,
was not sufficient. Therefore, the Board should form conclusions based on the
fact that Depo Provera is the
substantial cause and the extent of the harm, that
is osteoporosis worse than expected for an eighty year old person, is
201 Secondly, Mr Moglia suggested that the treatment of P must take account
of two things. First, the balance between risk and harm
which, he asserted, had
not happened in this case. Second, there should be sufficient certainty as to
the management of the restorative
treatment which, he asserted, had fallen
between the cracks in this case, in that the case manager’s evidence was
was being supervised by the GP, whose own evidence was that it was a
matter for the mental health service. An unanswered question
was whether
non-compliance with the Fosamax would breach the terms of P’s CTO
potentially leading to a return to inpatient
202 In any event, Mr Moglia argued that, given that the treatment for the
mental illness is the substantial cause of a serious harm
to P’s physical
health, the lack of a concerted system in place for ensuring that the
restorative treatment is being effective
to prevent harm, leaves P with an
unacceptable risk of harm and points to a lack of responsibility on the part of
the services for
the cure or restoration of his physical health.
203 Mr Moglia went on to argue that, if the disinhibition is said to be
caused by P’s mental illness, a matter he would not
concede, such as to
justify treatment with Depo Provera, then the State’s responsibility must
extend to the proper care of
P to restore him to a healthy condition or at least
maintain his physical health. If the Depo Provera is linked to P’s mental
illness, then so is the Fosamax, but the treatment plan does not go that far.
Leaving aside the primary submissions he had previously
made, he submitted that,
as an absolute minimum, the Board should make an order under s35A to that
204 Turning to the risk-benefit analysis, Mr Moglia conceded that the
authorised psychiatrist may have gone through an exercise, but
suggested that it
was faulty because of the lack of any ascertainable, objective or reliable
procedure to weigh them up. Applying
Dr DSu’s words, the seriousness of
the risk of "misbehaviour" must be weighed against the harm caused by the
treatment. In
his view, none of the treating team had articulated an objective
procedure to balance these two things, as evidenced by the witnesses’
inability to properly describe the charges that P had been convicted of, thereby
failing to grapple with the realities of what had
occurred in 2001.
205 Mr Moglia rejected the notion that the original charges were as important
as the conviction and sentence imposed, but agreed that
the reality of the risk
of reoffending remained the key issue. In his view, far too great a reliance on
hearsay, as opposed to an
objective record of what actually occurred, to record
P’s behaviours has led to inaccuracy as to the actual behaviours and
analysis of risk. He noted that no service witnesses had demonstrated a
principled or objective basis for a criminal behaviour risk
assessment in order
to assess and understand the comparison with the risk of harm of the treatment
being imposed. For example, there
was a failure in providing a sufficient
process to assess a fracture risk eight times the normal risk in comparison with
of sexually disinhibited behaviour. This demanded a revision of the
treatment plan under s35A to provide a satisfactory analysis
by the authorised
psychiatrist based on an objective or ascertainably objective process by which
risk and benefits are assessed and
compared. The service relied on Dr DSu,
whose process was the closest to an objective assessment.
206 Mr Moglia accepted that his submission may risk the situation that P will
be detained in the future, which was not his instructions,
but a better
treatment plan in the long-term should result from the Board requiring a
revision by the authorised psychiatrist who
would have to take into account the
law and what it requires.
207 Turning to the s8(1) criteria, Mr Moglia acknowledged his difficulties
and accepted that, even if treatment with Depo Provera
should not occur, the
evidence relating to treatment for schizophrenia and sexual disinhibition
together may not lead to the Board
discharging the CTO. However, the
Board’s decision under s35A should provide detail to the authorised
psychiatrist.
208 In respect of the issue as to what constitutes "necessary treatment", and
whether it includes Depo Provera or not, Mr Moglia asserted
that there would be
an argument for discharging P on the Depo Provera issue if the subsection were
drafted differently. Mr Moglia
pointed to the issue of whether identified
symptoms or behaviour of P may be explained by mental health concerns or other
disabilities,
which in turn raised an issue of equality, in that their
categorisation one way or the other may lead to forced treatment under the
For example, the difficulty in ascertaining the cause of P’s sexual
disinhibition and his poor executive functioning
skills was highlighted by Dr
DS’s evidence, leading to a question about whether they warrant mandatory
intervention under the
Act. He conceded that this presents a difficult
balancing exercise, particularly where mental health issues impact on others.
referred to Dr DSu’s evidence in relation to the risk of assault,
noting that compulsory treatment would not be justifiable
for several other
groups including people with intellectual disability or personality
209 Finally, in considering the evidence of Dr ML, Mr Moglia was adamant that
an actual fracture should not be the required symptom
before the Board was
satisfied of the extent of the potential harm to P. A spontaneous fracture
could occur without forewarning
or obvious symptoms. In these circumstances, he
argued that the Board should take account of the precautionary principle, that
not requiring certain proof that Depo Provera is causing the loss of bone
density, but reasonably accepting on all the evidence the
link as a sufficient
cause, if not the only and necessary cause.
Treating Services
210 On 24 November 2008, dealing with the s19A(2)
criteria, Ms Doyle noted that the evidence regarding P’s wishes and views,
in the context of consent and compliance, supported that, absent a requirement,
P would rather not continue treatment and medication,
a position consistent with
the views of the two case managers. Turning to subsection (c), the purpose of
treatment, each of the
medical experts gave clear and consistent views that P
continues to suffer from a mental illness and needs the prescribed antipsychotic
medication regime, he has little insight, there are continuing concerns about
compliance, and a suggestion that symptoms attributable
to auditory
hallucinations continue to persist. In total, this evidence supports the view
that there is an underlying mental illness
which requires treatment.
211 In respect of the treatment with Depo Provera, Ms Doyle submitted that
the evidence supported the benefit in the reduction of
sexual inappropriate
behaviour, which was reported to have re-emerged when the dosage was reduced on
three separate occasions. This
indicated the failure of these attempts with the
re-emergence of sexually disinhibited behaviour. On balance, in her view, the
of the treatment continue to outweigh the risks from a mental health
point of view. Therefore, continuing symptoms, sexually disinhibited
the three experiences of the failure of dose reductions, and the assessments
made in the "grand round" case conference
of relevant medical and clinical staff
and by the risk assessment committee all confirmed the opinion evidence and
supported findings
in relation to s19A(c), (d) and (e). On alternative
treatments, Androcur appeared to be the only feasible one, but raised compliance
issues. It was not thought by Dr JF that cognitive behavioural therapy will
work, leaving no viable beneficial alternative treatments.
212 On the available wealth of material, the Board should find that the
improvement in P's mental and physical state supports a conclusion
that the use
of the Act is working.
213 On 9 December 2008, Ms Doyle provided the Board with a further written
submission dealing with the criteria under s8, 19A and
35A, which she briefly
addressed. She submitted that the Board could reach its necessary conclusions
without the Charter interpretation
in respect of the s10(b) rights, because s4
and s8(1) of the Act require it to balance the rights of P and the rights of the
a matter which the Charter simply amplifies in respect of
patients’ rights.
214 In her written submission, Ms Doyle summarised the important aspects of
the evidence collected during the first two days of hearings
in respect of each
of the criteria. She took the Board through these in summary, supplementing the
evidence received on 9 December
2008. Unsurprisingly, she submitted that the
section 8(1) criteria were all met on the evidence, including the increased risk
sexual disinhibition on the reduction of the Depo Provera dosage. In respect
of less restrictive alternative treatment options,
she noted that other
medication and CBT were not considered viable alternatives.
215 In respect of s19A, she noted Dr DSu’s oral evidence that, at some
stage, treatment benefits might be outweighed by risks,
requiring guidance, but
counselled the Board and the authorised psychiatrist from elevating the
assessment to a rule or policy as
the criteria have to be applied in a way which
mirrors the risk-benefit analysis. In respect of risk to P, she highlighted the
progression
in reduction of the restrictive nature of the treatment settings
from Thomas Embling Hospital to P living with his family in the
community, a
direct result of his treatment with risperidone and Depo Provera. As for
alternative treatment options, the evidence
suggested that they are not
significantly different with respect to the impact on bone density, and Ms Doyle
noted that Depo Provera
appears to be a cause, but not necessarily the only
cause, of P’s osteoporosis. She conceded that his bone density scores
low and did not dispute the increased risk of fracture. However, she
highlighted the uncertainty about whether P is efficaciously
taking the Fosamax,
which the treatment plan notes is for his physical health.
216 Ms Doyle questioned the level of detail that should be required within a
treatment plan, particularly in relation to the level
of prescription for the
actions of the GP and/or the treating team. She did not concede the
State’s responsibility in respect
of the restorative medication for the
physical side-effects of treatment. She highlighted the intensive review
processes undertaken
by the services, including the grand round and referral for
reports from Forensicare.
217 Ms Doyle emphasised in respect of s19A that subsections (2) and (4) do
not appear to require treatment plans to include matters
relating to physical
treatment issues, although subsection (5) provides scope to the authorised
psychiatrist to add other relevant
matters. In her view, the Board is confined
to the question of review and revision of the treatment plan, but not to the
of prescribing the details of how medication is to be taken, especially
medication prescribed by P’s GP.
218 In relation to the evidence of Dr ML, the parties made the following
submissions:
Mr Moglia (for P):
there is clear
evidence that P’s bone density is lower than that which is normal for an
eighty year old, it has been acknowledged
as a known side-effect of the Depo
Provera, there has been a gradual reduction in bone density over the years
between 2005 and 2008,
which is significant, and, if any of the test scores are
to be set aside, it should be the 2004 score
once weakened, a
particular bone or bone area is susceptible to more troubling further weakening,
leaving it vulnerable to a higher
level of attack or a higher risk of fracture;
the nature of the risk is grave and should not require observation of actual
the spine is particularly vulnerable, the crumbling of which can
result in greater impacts such as paraplegia, when compared with
other bones
such as a fractured arm
whilst conceding
that the effects of treatment with Fosamax are known, episodic non-compliance
will only compromise its effect minimally,
when compared with drugs having an
acute effect, because of its long-term restorative effect
assessment noted a factor of eight in the increased risk of fracture or failure,
which is extreme.
Ms Doyle (for the treating services):
did not quibble
with the findings regarding the low bone density scores for P, and did not
dispute that he has a high risk of fracture;
however, she noted that in
relation to the causation and treatment submissions regarding his bone density,
it is difficult to include
or exclude the mental health treatments without
starting date data before the prescription of risperidone and Depo Provera (in
treated appropriately with Fosamax, which appears to be working to hold the
decline in bone density; P remains asymptomatic
at present, leaving open the
question of the source of the pain of which P complains; P’s current
scores do not inhibit usual
activities within the normal range
conceded that it
is difficult for the Board to make findings or draw inferences as to whether the
Depo Provera is solely responsible
or one of a number of causes of the reduction
in bone density in P.
Medical and Clinical Evidence
219 The Board heard evidence from a number of medical witnesses, as well as
the two case managers assigned to treat P, one from Werribee
Mercy and the other
from Inner West. In each case, all Board members asked the witnesses specific
questions, as did the parties’
legal representatives. Other than Dr ML
and Dr DSu, whose attendance to give evidence was requested on behalf of P, all

221 On most of the major medical and clinical issues, there was
broad consistency in the evidence. What follows is a summary of the
main points
made by the witnesses, together with any variations in their positions on key
13 October 2008
222 Before giving her evidence, the Board requested Mr Moglia
to outline his key submissions, so that Dr LD could address the specific
raised by them.
In summary, Dr LD gave the following information to the
Board in answer to its questions:
she had not seen
the documentation about the hearing, but had treated P for several months with
the MST team, and had been aware of
him when he lived at the Norfolk Terrace CCU
for several years;
she was aware
that Depo Provera had been prescribed at the CCU to reduce and control sexual
behaviour and activity, that the dose
of Depo Provera had been reduced because
of the side-effect of osteoporosis, leading to an increase in sexually
disinhibited behaviour
and desire for sexual interactions; she had received
second-hand reports about conversations with P that had suggested this to the
case manager and registrar - P had told his case manager, and his GP had
reported to a registrar, within the three months that the
service has been
managing him, that trams are unpatrolled, and he was looking for sexual
partners; the GP had also told the registrar
that P was looking at girls in a
sexually inappropriate way;
when asked about
P’s response to the reports of his thoughts, Dr LD agreed with Mr Moglia
that P denies them or says that what
he said to the GP was a mistake, leading to
her view that "at some level" he realises their importance;
in response to a
specific question as to whether the sexual disinhibition resulted from P’s
schizophrenia, Dr LD noted that
the syndrome often involves positive and
negative symptoms, which can affect the frontal lobes and create very real
disinhibition,
which is different from the voices and delusions; in her view,
treatment is important to reduce the negative symptoms, which in turn
the frontal lobe effect and sexual disinhibition; depot antipsychotic medication
does not treat these symptoms, but the reduction
in Depo Provera resulted in
inappropriate sexual thoughts returning, which in turn might result in
hospitalisation;
Dr LD consulted
with the office of the Chief Psychiatrist regarding treatment direction, after
which she decided to return P to the
original dose of 300 mg weekly, from the
reduced dose instigated by Saltwater Clinic;
she conceded
that, in analysing the link between P’s sexual desires and his mental
illness, it is difficult to extricate the
mental illness from changes in the
brain and to determine whether sexual disinhibition is a symptom of
schizophrenia or whether there
are two separate disorders, as not everyone with
schizophrenia has the symptom of sexual disinhibition; Dr LD confirmed that the
symptom of sexual disinhibition was indicative of frontal lobe changes, and that
other executive and planning difficulties were noted,
although she had not seen
any neuropsychological reports; she stated that P had some simple deficits and
some complex deficits from
his chronic schizophrenia;
she conceded
that P’s behaviours may have been subject to cultural aspects, such as
chewing khat, but indicated that his behaviour
was still culturally
inappropriate when compared with other patients who chew khat;
although he
denies it, Dr LD believed that P still hears and responds to voices, which has
been witnessed "in animated fashion", but
was unable to say if his behaviour was
part of a delusional system, as he is not very forthcoming in discussing such
matters; when
questioned, P denies having a mental illness or needing treatment,
despite observations that he has been seen to talk to himself,
and that his
history includes thought disorder, delusions and perceptual abnormalities, which
have been reduced with the use of antipsychotic
medication;
Dr LD was not
entirely satisfied that the current dose of risperidone controls his symptoms
well; she conceded that he is very sensitive
to medications, which have been
more or less efficacious with positive and negative symptoms, preferring the
zuclopenthixol but being
affected by extrapyramidal side-effects; a clozapine
trial made little difference and there was a question mark about compliance;
within the community setting, depot medication appears the most appropriate and
beneficial;
receiving medication to alleviate the effects of osteoporosis in the form of
vitamins, calcium and Fosamax, which increases
bone density, although it is
unclear about his regularity of taking them; the osteoporosis has been monitored
through outpatient
appointments; she conceded that risperidone consta may also
impact on the osteoporosis, as it can elevate prolactin levels and can
other problems, so it is difficult to determine which is worse in relation to
the risk of osteoporosis;
she expressed
the view that, without Depo Provera, she would be concerned about increasing
inappropriate sexual behaviour creating
a significant risk to other people;
Dr LD had been
informed that P had told a previous case manager at Saltwater Clinic that he had
obtained sexual favours during his
stay at Footscray House, giving cigarettes
for oral sex, which was not seen as normal or appropriate behaviour at the
Boarding house
among other patients;
continue the Depo Provera treatment unless she received a forensic psychiatric
assessment and a recommendation for alternative
treatment; the side-effects and
the amelioration of the side-effects by medication were being monitored by the
clinic from when P
was first put on medication; more recently this has been
regularly monitored by the Western Hospital endocrine clinic which diagnosed
osteoporosis and commenced P on treatment; on moving to Inner West, P would be
referred to Royal Melbourne Hospital;
specifically about alternatives to Depo Provera, Dr LD acknowledged that male
hormone levels are affected by all medications,
with depot medications being the
worst, but she had concerns about P’s compliance with oral
anti-androgens
suggestion of cognitive behavioural therapy as an alternative treatment, Dr LD
suggested that it was not appropriate for
P as he lacks the high level of
motivation required and is not cognitively intact, however it may be possible
with an appropriate
cognitive profile and patient motivation in an environment
such as Thomas Embling Hospital;
she did not
agree with Mr Moglia’s suggestion that his desire for a partner might be
"innocent and justifiable" and simply reflects
a legitimate desire to seek a
loving relationship, as it results in adverse attention and inappropriate
when asked about
the process by which an alternative medication to Depo Provera could be
substituted, Dr LD said it would require
time and investigation of other
possibilities; she said that the suggestion of Androcur would not necessarily
work as it also causes
osteoporosis; she gave the opinion that, if Depo Provera
was ceased, there was likely to be a deterioration in behaviour, but it
done immediately, as no withdrawal was required;
Dr LD understood
that P had only one conviction for a criminal offence, with nothing prior to it,
and that P has been well behaved
since because he has been under good treatment
in the form of medication the entire time.
223 Between Dr LD’s evidence and calling Dr DS, Ms Doyle
noted that P had attended an appointment at Western Hospital with an
Endocrinologist in September 2008, and that the service has been attempting to
obtain a report, so far without response. Discussion
ensued between legal
representatives and the Board about the need for current evidence of P’s
bone density to see whether it
has increased or decreased, evidence from
forensic psychiatrist, Dr DSu, and impact of the transfer of the CTO to Inner
224 Dr DS told the Board:
P had moved
approximately 5 months before the hearing, but Saltwater Clinic continued to
hold the CTO and clinical oversight through
a proposed two to three-month
transition period to enable the new service to get to know him before handing
over the treatment; this
would have occurred several months ago, but for the
Board hearing;
the service
(Saltwater Clinic) had attempted to reduce the dosage of the Depo Provera from
300 mg to 200 mg per week, by a reduction
of 25 mg each week over four weeks;
other alternatives including Androcur had been discussed, but rejected because
of compliance
issues as they are only available in oral form, and that they can
also cause osteoporosis;
service’s perspective on P’s treatment was that the CTO should
continue as a longitudinal analysis of the current
treatment regime supports its
effectiveness in applying the least restrictive environment to manage a very
serious mental illness
by progressively reducing the levels of restriction
required of P as he has moved from Thomas Embling Hospital to Sunshine extended
care unit to the CCU to the boarding house and finally to return to live with
his family;
when asked about
relapse pathology, Dr DS acknowledged that it is a difficult question, involving
many variables, and suspected that
some chronic psychotic symptoms were not
responsive and would depend on when treatment was reinstituted; because
P’s illness
has been longstanding and chronic, he would predict a
psychotic relapse without treatment; he noted that cognitive decline is well
recognised, and is multidimensional, in this case, affecting a gradual decline
in frontal lobe and executive functions, and P’s
affective and cognitive
domains with both positive and negative symptoms; he acknowledged that
treatments are not that effective
as far as cognitive decline is concerned, but
was unable to advise about recent brain scan results or neuropsychiatric or
psychological
assessments and whether there was any sign of atrophy;
when asked as to
whether there was any less restrictive measure available, Dr DS expressed the
view that, without either Depo Provera
or another anti-androgen treatment and
very close supervision, P would be likely to act on his sexual disinhibition; as
regards the
risperidone consta, he pointed out that the older depot
antipsychotic medications tended to have worse physical side effects, and
all depot medications increase prolactin levels and affect bone density, some
more than others, so he saw the current treatment
as the "lesser of the
when asked about
oral, atypical antipsychotic medication, such as aripiprazole, he conceded that
they were less problematic regarding
prolactin elevation, but also less
effective in controlling the symptoms of chronic mental illnesses; Dr DS
highlighted that the
treatment plan had been carefully considered by the
treating team, all of whom have been aware of the side-effects of the Depo
and have aimed to provide the lowest effective dose of antipsychotic
medication to keep P in the community;
agreed with the
psychiatrist member that prescription of Fosamax may have the effect of
improving P’s bone density;
when asked by Mr
Moglia about the relationship between P’s schizophrenia and his
inappropriate sexual behaviour, he referred
to the past history and noted that
such behaviour began at around the onset of his mental illness, and was
associated with "hypofrontality"
which led to impulsivity; he also suggested a
possible relationship with his delusional content, and a third possibility that
could be a component of intellectual disability leading to sexual
problems; treatment by the treating team has been more specifically
directed to
chronic schizophrenia and the cognitive component because of their view of the
link between schizophrenia and his sexual
disinhibition; he disagreed that
P’s behaviour was likely to be the result of a brain injury, although it
could be in some
cases; in relation to an assertion that P’s premorbid
non-verbal and executive functions being in the low range may make it
difficult to determine the cause of his disinhibition as schizophrenia or some
other cause, Dr DS agreed that it may be a confounding
in answer to a
question about the point at which the osteoporosis would be considered so severe
that treatment should be stopped,
he acknowledged that it was a complex
situation that did not lead to a simple answer, requiring consideration of the
severity of
symptoms, P’s mobility, home environment and other factors; he
acknowledged that, if the situation reached the level of fractures,
arguably that would be too far, although he conceded that he was not qualified
to give an opinion about the relative risk of
fracture in P compared with the
ordinary population.
225 Dr AM told the Board:
Dr AM reviewed P
on 20 March 2008 at Footscray House, just prior to the CTO being due to expire.
In his view, on a file review and
examination, P fulfilled the criteria and he
extended the CTO; he noted that P made several comments which seemed to involve
themes and suspiciousness but at a lower degree, he was not forthcoming
with information and he demonstrated a limited understanding
of his illness such
that he could not give informed consent;
since then, in
May 2008, P returned to live with his mother and has been in a transition
process in between; his second examination
of P took place on 23 September 2008
in preparation for the Board hearing, when he found no substantial difference in
state compared with the March 2008 examination; he attempted
some frontal lobe testing in an effort to obtain a sense about his
hypersexuality
and its connection with his mental illness or criminal behaviour,
and noted perseveration which he considered to be a basic distinguishing
he formed the
view that P’s persistent return to the question of why he was not off the
CTO was evidence of perseveration and
was related to the frontal lobe, although
he conceded that he was unaware of any brain imaging or testing which would
confirm structural
changes to P’s brain;
Dr AM explained
that, over the span of seven years since the start of P on the Depo Provera,
there had been at least three attempts
to reduce the dose, one in Thomas Embling
Hospital, a second in Sunshine extended care unit , and most recently by his MST
consultation with Dr DSu, reducing it by 25 mg at a time from 300 mg to
175 mg over a five week period in July and August 2008, then
then to the original 300 mg; in mid-August 2008, when the dose was at 175 mg, he
heard reports from clinical colleagues
that P was showing signs of inappropriate
sexual behaviour, leading him to wonder whether the reduction had been too
quick; after
discussion with Dr LD the dose was returned to 200 mg in the third
week of August, then increased to 300 mg in one dose after more
serious issues
in respect of
symptoms of mental illness, Dr AM conceded that, as a result of treatment with
antipsychotic medication, he found no
psychotic symptoms on questioning, but his
affect and demeanour were guarded and suspicious, and P displayed a limited
understanding
of the need for treatment which he described as "low-grade
psychotic symptoms";
Dr AM expressed
the opinion that, if P ceased taking antipsychotic and Depo Provera medication,
it would be likely that he would relapse
significantly with a risk of
self-neglect and a risk to the community if he acts on his urges which are
delusionally driven;
acknowledged the difficulty in determining the link between mental illness and
sexual disinhibition, but noted that two of the
three reductions in the
medication occurred in a custodial setting leading him to wonder whether,
because of the limit setting environment,
his hypersexuality is part of the
schizophrenic spectrum of symptoms and therefore tends to the conclusion that it
is more likely
to be related to schizophrenia than other causes;
P’s khat addiction and use, and its impact on his sexual disinhibition, he
understood that it is derived from a native
bush and has a chemical component
with properties similar to amphetamines, which may lead to a sense of euphoria
and wellbeing that
increase P’s sexual urges;
in respect of
the question of consent, Dr AM stated that his September 2008 review with
Waratah Clinic case manager, MP, involved
a lengthy discussion about whether P
would continue to take medication and attend for treatment if he were not
required to, to which
he was non-committal, indicating that he would take
medication for one year, but did not need to, but did not believe that he
ongoing treatment; his assessment of P’s understanding and
insight was that he lacked the intellectual and true emotional insight
translate his words into action, making it unlikely that he would continue
treatment, particularly with the Depo Provera, which
he would stop
immediately;
dealing with the
question of the least restrictive treatment option, Dr AM added to what Dr LD
had said about the possibility of cognitive
behavioural therapy, noting that it
was more likely to be successful if used in the forensic setting;
acknowledged the rights issues relating to the treatment of P with Depo Provera
and the ethical challenges for the treatment
team, noting that they were
carefully monitoring its impact on his bones and skeletal system, but was
unaware of any recent orthopaedic
he agreed that
the sexual disinhibition was a symptom of schizophrenia, which is currently
under control with medication, as a result
of which the sexual disinhibition is
also under control or reduced; however, he disagreed that this situation reduced
the need for
Depo Provera, as it is the treatment which reduces P’s
hypersexuality, and is part of the overall treatment being provided
illness of schizophrenia, not for any reason of deterrence or punishment;
Risperdal consta, he conceded that P attended without prompting to receive the
injection, but agreed with Dr DS that P
has demonstrated poor reasoning and
executive functions, making it difficult to determine what motivates his
behavioural aspects
- mental illness, disability, ill will, and his true
capacity to consent to treatment as opposed to agree to continue taking some
medication for 12 months; off the CTO, Dr AM’s impression was that P would
not voluntarily comply, and would not choose to
do so, irrespective of whether
he wants treatment or not;
regarding what
level of damage to P’s bone structure would be too serious a side-effect,
Dr AM conceded that it is a very difficult
question that has led to previous
efforts to reduce the level of use of Depo Provera, and continues to require
regular balancing
of risks and benefits, in this case preventing the risk of
future offending against the harm caused by the drugs; he conceded that
seriousness attributed to the behaviour by the courts and the gravity of
offending are legal matters, but that the treating team
continued to work to
reduce, and eventually cease, the use of Depo Provera based on the circumstances
at the time.
226 Ms Doyle informed the Board that, according to her
understanding, the most recent bone density test was carried out on 16 March
2007, although she was unable to provide test results more recent than the one
in July 2006.
Case Manager, Mr SC
227 Mr SC told the Board:
period that P lived at Footscray House, a supported accommodation facility, his
psychiatric and diabetic medication was
supervised, but his compliance was such
that on several occasions his blood sugar levels were problematic, as he refused
necessary testing equipment, which SC would resource when
he had witnessed
very few positive symptoms, although P would occasionally say that he would talk
to himself or complain that people
in the street were looking at him oddly,
suggesting some paranoia towards others, but denied hearing voices, and was
often guarded;
P generally denied that he had a mental illness, and was always
appropriate, although at the start he had been overfamiliar and had
invading people's personal space, touching them or standing very close,
particularly to women; once he was advised of
the issue and cultural
differences, P ceased this conduct completely;
in the past,
excessive use of alcohol and khat, together with gambling, caused significant
financial and other problems, leading to
his funds being managed by State
Trustees who now limit how much money he can have and use;
relating to risk
issues, SC recalled that a female MST staff member and the manager at Footscray
House had complained of inappropriate
behaviour with staring and touching,
hugging intellectually disabled residents, but that this ceased when he was
transfer to Inner West, P had continued to receive his weekly injections; it was
on the last visit that P had made a comment
if he knew of any without cameras, and indicated that he had thoughts about
women, but would
not do anything about it because he felt that he might be
deported; SC indicated that he had made the assumption that P was thinking
women in the lifts;
on the question
of consent to treatment, he said that he had discussed this with P who was
guarded and slightly paranoid, and had
told him that on or off the CTO he would
not take medication, originally all medication, but later he said he would
continue to take
antipsychotic medication but not the Depo Provera
as to compliance
with the diabetic medication, SC said that P had lost 7 kg in weight according
to the endocrinologist, and misconstrued
the advice about the need to continue
medication.
228 Ms Doyle asked SC for his recollection of the process by which
the dosage of Depo Provera had been reduced, to which he responded
initially it was by 25 mg every four weeks from 300 mg to 250 mg, with no overt
signs or changes reported or observed, then
25 mg per week from 250 to 175 mg,
the whole process taking a number of weeks and being monitored by Saltwater and
then Waratah,
with 225 mg being the last dose that SC provided on the day that
the lift discussion took place; the reports he received from Waratah
Clinic were
that staff were not comfortable about the way P was staring at and talking about
women, and that it was the GP who suggested
that the dose be increased to 300
229 In response to a suggestion that the depot injection could be given
voluntarily and assertive follow-up by the MST team could
be given if P failed
to attend, SC pointed out that, in those circumstances, P would have the right
not to attend for treatment,
and they would be required to wait for a relapse,
which might involve an inpatient admission and a return back to the level of
restriction
previously required.
24 November 2008
230 Dr JF told the Board:
There is no
distinction in the funding received by area mental health services for treatment
of voluntary and involuntary patients;
almost all funding comes from State
recurrent funds, except selected areas such as dual diagnosis, which come via
grants usually
from the Victorian government. General recurrent funds are
provided as a "job lot" and each service determines how it spends its
with no portion being earmarked specifically for involuntary patients;
a few months
ago, Dr JF took part in a "grand round", a case conference in which the
registrar provided a 15 minute case summary and
presented the issues involved in
P’s treatment to a large group of up to 50 clinicians from the service,
including 8-12 consultant
psychiatrists, who then discussed the clinical issues
for 20-25 minutes. He noted that P had a long-standing mental illness and
there were significant concerns about his sexual and predatory behaviour and the
role of Depo Provera, in particular the side-effect
of osteoporosis from the
hormones. He was aware that the service at Saltwater Clinic had reduced the dose
in an effort to reduce
the side-effects, but that there was concern that some of
the symptoms of sexual disinhibition had returned;
there are no
viable alternatives to Depo Provera, and what alternatives there are are
variants of the same thing, involving female
sex hormones, which reduce sexual
drive, but all have some effect on bone density;
acknowledging
his experience working with behavioural programs for sex offenders, he lacked
confidence in the capacity of P to effectively
undertake cognitive behavioural
therapy, which requires a patient to be able and willing to understand something
of the cognitions
which relate to feelings and be able to work on them;
Dr JF was unsure
whether P’s case was ever referred to the risk management committee, which
operates differently from the grand
round, focusing every two months on
referrals from teams within the service of cases that raise risk issues. No
notes are kept from
either grand rounds or risk management committee
he advised that
the service’s process for assessing risk of behaviour to be avoided is
based on information provided from the
treating team, including the consultant
psychiatrist, and, if there is a discrepancy, following it up with second
opinions, greater
detail or a referral to a grand round or risk management
committee meeting. He conceded that there were no easy answers in relation
sexual misbehaviour and the standards to be applied, but said that it involved a
review of past behaviour and events, together
with an assessment of
patients’ levels of insight and understanding, and remorse. Decisions to
treat patients with Depo Provera,
and to review and reduce the dosage, are not
taken lightly, but with great care, and occur in only a very few cases out of
the thousands
that the service treats. Steps involved include an assessment of
a patient's improvement in general clinical state as a result of
not having to
deal with sexual impulses, other social improvements in assisting a return to
normal life, and increasing insightful
understanding as observed by the clinical
staff who are skilled at forming a reasonable view of what the community thinks
taking account of cultural, social and religious differences.
Case Manager, Mr MP
231 Mr MP told the Board:
he advised that
his initial meeting (with Dr LD) with P and the Saltwater Clinic case manager,
SC, occurred in mid-July 2008, after
which he and SC met weekly with P for the
next four weeks for P to receive his Depo Provera medication. After that, he
P at least weekly, sometimes twice a week when there was a specific
reason such as a financial or physical health issue;
he confirmed
that the reduction in Depo Provera occurred before the transition commenced, but
he had some uncertainty about the process
and rate of reduction of the
medication. Personally, he did not notice any change in behaviour on his weekly
reviews, but he had
who reported to him that P had "voiced sexualised thoughts about young
and discussed that he may be observed on public transport by hidden cameras.
Under questioning, he explained further that
the comments were made in the
context of the overall examination by the GP, and that P felt that he was being
monitored by hidden
cameras on public transport. As a result, MP discussed this
with his team leader and Dr LD, and a decision to refer the issue to
management committee was made. MP attended the meeting, which resulted in a
decision to continue monitoring P and to return
the dose of Depo Provera to 300
mg weekly in one injection which, he believed after referring to the clinical
file, was given to
P on 28 August 2008. He immediately arranged an appointment
with P and an interpreter to discuss the decision with him;
he advised in
respect of his own observations regarding sexualised behaviour and thoughts that
the only concerns have been about P’s
continuing but transparent use of
khat, and overfamiliar touching involving "a hand on my shoulder", which MP had
discouraged on
a number of occasions;
MP rejected a
suggestion that the rapid decrease in Depo Provera was a reason for concern in
the context of any problems for P in
catching up emotionally, but pointed out
that the rapid increase in sexualised behaviour was consistent with Dr
DSu’s forensic
report and P’s previous history, and also the
recommendation to carefully monitor P in the event of a reduction in
medication;
in respect of
the GP's comments, MP felt that the reference to the monitoring represented a
return of P’s paranoid thoughts;
when asked about
the process of assessment of the nature of the behaviour - in terms of severity
and danger - sought to be avoided
by Depo Provera treatment, MP indicated that
he relied on historical information and past behaviour resulting in charges and
detention in Thomas Embling Hospital and a secure extended care unit,
together with a comparison of behaviour before and after treatment,
the observation of increased sexual behaviour symptoms at the time of reduction
of the treatment on two occasions. The
treating team consulted the Chief
Psychiatrist;
as for the bone
density testing, MP was aware of the 2006 and 2008 results, and stated that it
was planned to continue to monitor
and regularly test this. The treatment plan
was developed in conjunction with the GP focusing on P’s mental health,
but requiring
three-monthly medication reviews of all medication, including
medications for diabetes and other physical health problems, as well
compliance with medications; the service prescribes the risperidone and Depo
Provera only, with the other medications, including
Fosamax, prescribed by the
GP, with whom the service remains in regular contact;
since reviewing
P weekly from August 2008, no overtly sexualised behaviour or comments have been
he has discussed
the treatment plan with P, who shows a reasonable general understanding in
conversation, although an interpreter
was arranged for two reviews, one with the
registrar and P’s mother to obtain a clear understanding of the home
situation and
approval of the treatment plan, and the second with the consultant
psychiatrist to ensure clarity around the discussions, especially
discussion about his feelings;
regarding the
balance between benefits and side-effects of Depo Provera, MP felt that the
benefits continue outweigh the problems,
referring back to the report of Dr DSu
which highlighted the potential result of offending behaviour and a return to
hospital in
the context of decreasing or discontinuing the treatment. He
observed that P is "his own worst enemy in telling us about his thoughts";
MP noted that
the treatment plan was in place before Waratah Clinic took over P’s
treatment, but the treatment is being regularly
reviewed by the consultant
psychiatrist three-monthly and the registrar monthly, who not only monitor the
medication and its efficacy,
and the risks, but are informed by the previous
information available from Saltwater Clinic and Norfolk Terrace.
232 Dr SG told the Board:
Dr SG informed
the Board that his first contact with P was in July 2008 and outlined the mental
health and treatment information,
including risk issues, given to him via file
access; he advised that he has seen P twice for review, once with his mother and
interpreter in order to introduce information about the service and the
treatment plan, and discuss psychoeducation and community
he presented the
case to the grand round conference, and expressed views on risk issues,
sexualised behaviour and P’s response
to medication at the dosage of 300
mg per week, but did not attend the risk management committee meeting. No
experts on bone density
or P’s physical health issues attended the grand
he advised that,
in respect of physical health issues, he had relied on MP’s discussion
with the GP, with whom he had not spoken
directly. After the second clinical
review interview four weeks after the first, he had personally observed P
crossing the road
talking to himself, probably responding to voices, but P was
guarded and denied it on interview. He found it difficult to engage
with P, but
he felt that P lacked insight, despite saying superficially that he has a mental
illness and is prepared to take medication,
because when asked about past
incidences of schizophrenia he denies them, and minimised his past
Dr SG advised Mr
Moglia that the treating team had not considered or made efforts to facilitate
P’s access to sex, nor was it
part of the treatment plan, agreed that his
sexual urge has been successfully suppressed at 300 mg and reiterated his view
thoughts and behaviour appeared inappropriate in the context of
the GP's comments. Any further dosage reduction will be based on
experiences as a guide;
he doubted that
a failure by P to take his Fosamax would lead to a revocation of the CTO despite
its importance as a health issue;
he expressed the view that P’s
unreliability to take tablets and risk of inadequate compliance reduced the
possibility of replacing
Depo Provera with Androcur.
233 Dr DS was recalled:
Dr DS confirmed
that he was aware of three attempts to reduce the dosage of Depo Provera, one by
Forensicare, one at Norfolk Terrace
and the recent Saltwater Clinic trial. He
had seen a written report from Norfolk Terrace, but not the full records. He
aware of the details regarding dosages, nor a previous clozapine trial.
He had not attended the grand round conference.
234 After specifically seeking P’s consent to
him participating in the hearing, Dr NH told the Board:
for several
months, he has treated P for diabetes and medical issues, leaving the treatment
of his psychiatric illness to the service;
P’s mother assists in the
treatment of P’s diabetes, but even with that assistance, P’s
management of the illness
was mostly "hopeless", although it is currently better
than it was; he asserted that "P needs help", as the condition, which is his
most important physical health problem, is not under control and P does not take
regular blood sugar readings;
Dr NH was aware
of the Board's interest in comments P had made to him, as he had informed P at
the time that he should discuss them
with his doctors, and had advised Waratah
Clinic on the day. He was unaware of the date. On that one occasion, P had
informed him
that, on a train, he had looked at a particular person and was
concerned "if he did anything wrong". P had asked him not to make
it an issue.
He alerted Waratah Clinic to take some interest in talking to P about it, but
took no further action;
Fosamax, the service asked him to prescribe it, but he left the bone density
issues to Waratah Clinic;
he tries to see
P weekly if possible, but he turns up less regularly, usually with his
9 December 2008
235 Dr ML told the Board:
Dr ML had access
to four bone density scan reports dated 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2008;
bone density
studies provide x-rays that enable a calculation of how much calcium is present
in bones, as this allows an assessment
of their strengths and susceptibility to
breaking. The two major measurements are done at the lumbar spine, L1-4 or
L2-4, and the
hip, the sub-femoral neck and upper femur. Bone density is
measured by the amount of calcium in grams per square centimetre, with
comparisons made between the individual and the normal population. The graphs
show the statistical distribution line representing
the average normal value for
particular age groups, with a bell-shaped curve demonstrating plus or minus two
standard deviations
representing 95% of the population. 2.5% of the population
appear above and 2.5% of the population appear below the coloured zones
Dr ML noted
variations in the four reports, in that the last two had been conducted under
his guidance at Royal Melbourne Hospital
photographing L1-4, whereas the
previous tests and reports had been had been prepared at another hospital
photographing L2-4. He
said this would make very little difference, but did
indicate that different machines could give slightly varied results;
T-scores compare
the person with the whole population of 20-30 year olds and the Z-scores compare
the person with a population of
similar age. In P’s case they are
virtually identical because he is within the prime age group of 20-30 years;
in relation to
P, his hip has been fairly normal on all studies, whereas his lumbar spine is
abnormal, as shown in the table at the
bottom of the report. His statistical
value of -3 placed him in the bottom 1% of the population. His score indicated
eight times as likely to fracture his spine as a person at the
midpoint of the normal range. In practical terms, he is susceptible
spontaneous fracture caused by vertebrae collapse from lack of calcium and the
effect of weight. This is different from traumatic
fracture, and the risk is
likely to get worse as he gets older. By contrast, Dr ML expressed the view
that the normal hip result
is surprising;
in comparing the
study results from 2004 to 2008, Dr ML noted that there had not been much change
over the period. It was difficult
to ascertain why P had a low calcium reading
in the spine and why it had not changed significantly, and he questioned whether
was because of the therapy. But he noted that he had no starting point
before the time when P was commenced on Depo Provera. He
concluded that there
was an increased risk of fracture in the spine, but not the hip, but it was not
getting worse. In general,
the risk of spontaneous fracture is small in young
people, but increases from the age of the late 30s and early 40s;
in addressing
the causes of osteoporosis, progesterone medications have been found to cause it
in women, although he was unaware of
data about normal men. It was difficult to
ascertain whether medication was the cause without a starting point. There are
two different
and strontium vanalate. Fosamax is a biphosphonate, with the recommended
of 10 mg daily which, Dr ML suggested, should stabilise the condition and he
would expect an increase in the calcium load without
needing higher doses of the
medication;
when asked about
advising P in respect of the risk of fracture, Dr ML said that he would counsel
against extremely risky behaviours
such as riding motorbikes. In respect of
carrying weights, he would advise not to do anything outside what P would
normally do.
He agreed that exercising would have a positive effect on both
muscles and bones, and suggested it as a positive strategy, but starting
he confirmed
that vitamin D and calcium may help restore bone density, was unsure about the
effect of risperidone on osteoporosis,
and doubted that diabetes added to
P’s risk. In his view, Fosamax would halt the decline in calcium loss
precipitated by the
prescription of Depo Provera, and suggested that the reports
confirmed that it had done so. He asserted that, if Depo Provera was
the bone density should improve in the spine;
in addressing
the difference in results between the spine and the hip, he said that he has
seen this difference periodically, but
is unable to explain it;
he suggested
that spinal symptoms would only be evident with an actual fracture;
unaware of any research that suggested that there were specific effects or
side-effects on particular patients, nor was
he aware of different responses in
different parts of the body. He agreed, however, that he could not exclude the
possibility of
the side-effect of Depo Provera in reducing bone density in P in
the two different degrees in the two locations, but was not aware
evidence to support it;
individual vulnerability in the L1-4 region, Dr ML said it was common for the
lower vertebrae to have a slightly higher
risk than the higher vertebrae;
in discussing
the variations between the scores over the four tests, Dr ML considered them
small and relatively insignificant, unless
related to P stopping the medication.
He agreed that, if the Depo Provera were to be ceased, its effect on the bone
density would
also cease.
236 Dr DSu told the Board:
access to 8 volumes of P’s files from his time in Thomas Embling Hospital,
including a discharge summary from 2001;
his personal
role in providing secondary consultations had involved one meeting with P in
2007 and several telephone consultations
to Norfolk Terrace and Werribee Mercy
area mental health service;
he conceded that
prescription of Depo Provera is unusual, but when it is prescribed by
Forensicare, because of the range of fairly
significant side-effects, the
forensic service makes itself available to monitor and advise on risks and
in assessing the
bone density issue, Dr DSu said he assessed three different factors, namely the
individual problem being treated
in the first place and the significance of the
risk of dangerous offending, compared with occasional nuisance behaviour, other
concerns such as age, metabolic response etc, and the nature of the harm,
for example physical consequences or the increased risk,
such that it was
sufficient to consider ceasing the treatment;
in relation to
P’s offending history, Dr DSu noted that P persisted in denying all
knowledge of offending or inappropriate behaviour,
or said he had no
recollection because he was drunk; on admission to Thomas Embling Hospital, it
was noted his behaviour caused problems
as he was persistently inappropriately
touching people or making sexualised gestures, which caused a nuisance and
placed him at risk
of assault by others; under cross-examination, Dr DSu
accepted that the final charges on which P was convicted may have been two
charges of indecent assault leading to a good behaviour bond, and that the
original charge was assault with intent to rape and was
not proceeded with;
in relation to
the index offence, he understood that it was attempted rape of a woman on a
train, at which time his behaviour was
disinhibited. He ended up in Thomas
Embling Hospital. He referred to a 11 April 2001 summary of charges to confirm
that the initial
charge was downgraded to assault with intent to rape, indecent
assault and assault, resulting in time served and a good behaviour
after leaving
Thomas Embling Hospital, Forensicare continued to provide consultations
including attempts to reduce Depo Provera in
the community, but on each occasion
staff noted a recurrence of sexually inappropriate behaviour and the attempts
were aborted quickly
because of the difficulty in managing the behaviour;
Dr DSu made it
clear to the Board that, in analysing how to treat the person with the problem,
Depo Provera was not prescribed for
the benefit of a community, but for the
benefit of the individual, in this case P, with whom the pros and cons are
discussed. In
a report dated 21 May 2007, later provided to the Board, Dr DSu
advised Inner West that its use was justifiable under the Act because
incapable of providing consent because of his poor insight, denial of previous
inappropriate sexual behaviour and inability
to accept the consequences of
cessation of the medication. With every patient, he would always look for an
appreciation by the person
of his past behaviour and potential future behaviour,
as a means of establishing a realistic way to deal with it. With a number
patients, if they can countenance the risk, they are capable of electing or
refusing to take the medication, but P was unable
to do this, as he could not
make an informed decision;
in relation to
the connection between paranoid schizophrenia and P’s sexual behaviour, Dr
DSu stated that, based on the absence
of other disordered sexual interests, the
lack of such problems until he developed a psychotic illness and the reduction
in symptoms
when the treatment of the psychotic illness is more effective, P
does not suffer from a sexual disorder such as paraphilia. He was
also aware of
two second opinions from other experts, including a neuropsychiatrist, both of
whom were of the opinion that the behaviour
was related to psychosis rather than
frontal lobe syndrome or brain injury. Therefore, on balance, it was considered
symptoms are a direct consequence of his mental illness, rather
than a primary sexual disorder or brain injury. His disinhibition
with his psychotic symptoms and executive dysfunction, and can be well
controlled so long as the psychotic symptoms are
controlled;
in dealing with
the risk-benefit analysis, he recommended the use of calcium and vitamin D
supplements, together with Fosamax or a
similar medication to reduce the bone
density impact of the medication. Any decision to cease Depo Provera would be
made by the
service, and he would recommend that it be done gradually in an
inpatient setting, so that, if the sexual behaviours returned, professional
staff could minimise the consequences in a way which could not be done in the
community, where P might be liable to be assaulted
or P’s sexual behaviour
may lead to risk to others;
when asked about
the treatment options for P, Dr DSu considered antipsychotic medication as the
primary treatment option on the basis
of the causal link between psychosis and
his sexual behaviour. These medications increased prolactin levels which
reduces sexual
drive, but do not minimise genital functioning or sexual
behaviour. By comparison, Depo Provera medication is prescribed to reduce
P’s libido, with the main alternative option being Androcur, which is
likely to be slightly more effective, but as an oral
medication creates
compliance issues. He was unaware of comparative research between the two
medications or their effect on bone
density, but thought it would be similar.
The decision on Depo Provera resulted from P’s reluctance to take
medication;
in relation to
other potential alternative medications, Dr DSu mentioned SSRI antidepressant
medications such as Prozac to reduce
sex drive, but said the supporting evidence
was more limited. In respect of risperidone, Dr DSu acknowledged that all
antipsychotic
medications have a slight effect on bone density, but the exact
extent is difficult to assess. He conceded however that Depo Provera
to be the main contributor in P’s case;
regarding the
management of the cessation of Depo Provera, Dr DSu indicated that Dr DS’s
view that this may require P to be
hospitalised for months might be seen as
unfair, but would reduce the possibility of any increase in sexual behaviours
causing problems
that might lead to personal problems or backlash, or even
victimisation by his community. Based on the history of attempts to reduce
Depo Provera, he suggested that there was a clear and demonstrable risk increase
in the possibility of custody, offending or
victimisation;
Provera has been ceased, normal fertility would return within three to six
months, although prolonged treatment may impact
on the suppression of
testosterone in the body and take longer. He noted that with age there is a
natural decline in testosterone
P’s desire to have relationships with women and form a family, Dr DSu
conceded that there was a strong dose dependent
relationship with sexual
functioning such that, at higher doses of Depo Provera, sexual thoughts,
erection and ejaculation are significantly
reduced, but titrating it to lower
doses would potentially allow some form of effective sexual functioning; the
most recent testosterone
testing of P indicated its suppression to a very low
level compared with the average for his age;
Dr DSu conceded
that area mental health services were often ambivalent about promoting sexual
activity amongst patients, but was unaware
of any specific procedures or
policies used to assess P’s capacity for normal sexual behaviour. This
was because of consent
issues and vulnerability;
in addressing
what level of side-effects would lead to cessation of the Depo Provera
medication, Dr DSu acknowledged that continual
risk-benefit reassessments have
led to adjustments, in balancing the clear risk of bone density reduction
against the risks of offending,
conceding that there was evidence of actual harm
to P’s bone density compared with a risk of reoffending which was
speculative
based on observed behaviours;
he reiterated
his view that it was preferable to reduce the medication in an inpatient setting
so that any problematic increase in
sexual behaviour could be managed more
safely for P by staff acting in a therapeutic manner, rather than by the
criminal justice
system or worse vigilante action; if he had to make the
decision himself, Dr DSu said that he would seek to admit P to hospital and
develop a management plan involving a graded reduction of medication and
discussion of any decisions around increased behaviour and
reinstituting higher
doses, together with psychological input to manage sexual urges and develop
strategies to reduce their impact.
He pointed out that he was not involved in
the previous attempts to reduce or cease the medication;
he agreed that
testing had established that in general P had borderline or extremely low
capacities in reasoning and executive skills,
but he was unable to be certain
whether the cognitive impairment was the result of a brain injury when younger
or the psychotic illness.
His view was that psychological treatments would
prove difficult because of capacity issues, P’s level of functioning and
his reluctance, requiring staff to pitch programs at a very concrete level. He
conceded that the exact contributing causes to P’s
sexual disinhibition
were unclear but rejected any notion that P had a bad attitude. On the balance
of evidence available, including
the reports of two highly regarded second
opinion specialists, his impression was that the cognitive impairment was
related to the
schizophrenic illness in the absence of evidence of a brain
injury, acquired brain injury, frontal lobe syndrome or other causes.
P’s Evidence
237 On 24 November 2008, in his evidence to the Board in answer to questions,
he receives the
Depo Provera injection weekly and the risperidone injection fortnightly from the
service, and understood that one
was for sexual issues and the other for his
mental health;
he believed that
the risperidone does help, but has side-effects in that he can't bend down or
pick things up; he believed he needed
risperidone for his mental health "if I'm
sick", and would take it if required to, but if he had a choice "I wouldn't take
he said that
side-effects of the Depo Provera are not good, and if he fell or climbed, he
might break a bone; he said "I can’t
pick up anything, even light objects"
for fear of fractures, but was not specifically aware of the Fosamax, though he
said he took
all his medication and measured his blood sugar levels;
when asked about
paranoid schizophrenia, P said "I used to have it but I feel better now; I am
getting better now". When asked why,
he mentioned medication, freedom of
movement and "God helps me too", stating that he "enjoys living at home";
when asked about
criminal charges, he mentioned sitting in the train and touching a person who
complained, stating that touching him
was "an error, a mistake". With respect
to the allegations that, in Footscray House, he traded cigarettes for oral sex,
he did three times, but the woman involved "demanded it". He denied
discussing cameras in trams;
when asked about
the reduction of the Depo Provera in mid-2008, P denied any change in his level
of sexual desire; he did not know
why the dose was increased. He said it was
discussed with his case manager, but he did not know the reason and he denied
had increased sexual urges;
when asked about
continuing treatment, P thought it was unnecessary as he is "feeling better".
He said his goals were to lead a normal
life, and be independent, and to seek
work possibly as a salesperson, although he acknowledged he had no prior
experience. He said
he enjoyed having a cup of tea with and talking to his
in relation to
chewing khat, he acknowledged that he does so about twice a week, and that it
makes him feel happy for about four to
six hours; he sometimes does it with
friends; he denied that it affects his sexual urges or desires. He acknowledged
common in his community, but denied other drug or alcohol use,
stating that he stopped drinking alcohol when he moved back to live
in relation to
receiving the injections, he said he felt back pain, pain at the site of the
injection, and pain all over his body.
It lasts about a day. He said that the
process of receiving the injection "humiliates me";
illness, P confirmed that he used to have one, when he was an inpatient in about
2000, but is "feeling better now".
Then, he was told he was sick, and he
thought so himself, but he was unable to say how. His mother took him to EPPIC,
went to Thomas Embling Hospital, and she told him he was sick, but he
said that he had had a fight with her and had left the home.
He acknowledged
that he used to hear voices, but denied that it has happened since. He thought
it was only on one occasion and
he got better. He said that he was sick from
2000 to 2005, but has been well for last few years. He was unable to say why
the doctors
think he needs treatment;
hearing, he said he understood that it was about him and living a free life, and
he said he takes
all his medications, that his GP looks after his diabetes medication and he
follows his instructions and attends
all appointments, although he acknowledged
that he might miss some if he is busy;
he denied that
he had said, as recorded in his clinical file on 20 November 2008, that his
family had taken his recently purchased
mobile phone from him, denying that he
bought a mobile phone;
P confirmed that
he would not take his medications if it was not required, although he suggested
that this applied only to the injections.
He said he would take his medication
for diabetes and would take the Fosamax. He did not think that a mental illness
back without medication, but said that if something did happen, or he
felt sick or ill, he would contact the doctor. He thought
that he could tell
when he was ill, giving an example of starting to talk to himself. If he had
thoughts about women, sexual feelings
or wanting to touch women, he would see
the doctor;
he could not
recall why he had asked Dr NH if he had done something wrong regarding the
person on the train;
the incident
with his brother and a knife was not to do with mental illness, they fought over
238 In answer to questions from Mr Moglia:
P said that his
back hurts always, including in bed
Dr NH told him
to take the tablets he prescribes, and said they were good for his bones;
he had some
memory of 2000-2001, stating that his memory is okay, and thought he was
mentally ill then as he was talking to himself;
receiving any information, good or bad, from service staff, including both case
managers, about his bones or about bending.
239 When asked by Ms Doyle:
P denied asking
don't think I told him", but said that
they argued about things, including
injections.
KH’s Evidence
240 P gave the Board permission to ask questions of his mother. In her
evidence in answer to questions, KH advised:
P is doing well
now, and she noted a big difference compared with 2000, when she had concerns
P’s behaviour was not normal, that
he hid himself, did not clothe himself properly or go to school. She went to
for help, but had difficulties with language etc. As a result, P
ended up in hospitals, clinics, the community care unit and other
places before
returning home. On the one hand, this was good, as P received medical help,
which stopped him ending up on the streets,
but she acknowledged that the
side-effects "are not really good for him";
over the last
six months, P has taken his medication and his social behaviour has been okay.
His relationships with the family have
been good, he plays and talks with his
siblings, much better than he did, she can have normal discussions with him, and
his behaviour
is "very normal". She acknowledged that he chews khat, which she
described as "acceptable", for example, when he feels tired. He
goes quiet and
becomes less talkative;
KH said she was
not informed about the bone issues, and noted that she lives on the 15th floor.
When there is no elevator, sometimes
P can only walk to the second level, in
which case he stays downstairs;
if P were not on
medication for a mental illness, KA conceded that she did not know whether
anything would happen, or whether it was
the medication or God that has made him
better. She thought that she would notice if he became unwell, but has had no
concerns so
far, as P takes his medication. She worries about the side-effects.
She thought that, if the medication were stopped, she would
note it if he did
not do things properly;
attending appointments, KH conceded that he is sometimes late and sometimes not
clean or properly washed, although she said
his personal cleanliness is
generally satisfactory, but sometimes requires her to tell him;
she told the
Board that she has a long wish list for P, including a normal life, getting
married, having offspring, and taking short
courses to obtain employment,
something P has thought about but not started yet;
she first noted
differences between P and his brothers and sisters in about 1992 in Djibouti,
before they arrived in Australia in
1999. She thought that she probably noticed
it over six or seven years, and it got worse after arrival in Australia. He
more worries for her than the others, as he stopped attending school and
playing with his siblings. His self care was poor, and
he sometimes used to
smile in an unusual way. She didn't think he was any harm to others, but things
got worse in Australia when
he drank alcohol;
now P gets on
with his brothers and sisters, and they talk to one another. She thanked
everyone involved and hoped that God would
properly resolve things.
KH has other
family members in Melbourne, including a brother; she denied ever hearing about
an improper relationship between P and
her brother's wife, as was recorded in
the medical report.
241 KH responded to a question from Mr Moglia about pressure on P
to have a wife and family, saying that it wasn't coming from her,
year old men have some pressure. She said "I'd be happy if he married and had
242 On 9 December 2008, after hearing all the medical evidence, the
Board’s psychiatrist member asked further questions of P
and KH regarding
the use of the Fosamax medication. P said he was aware of the big tablet, which
he took every Monday with his diabetes
medication, usually with a half glass of
water. He explained his morning routine, indicating that he would usually have
his breakfast
straight after taking the tablets. He was unaware of any special
instructions. He said he takes it every week, and has not missed
indicated that she was also unaware of any special instructions for taking
Fosamax, other than to take it on Monday before
breakfast, although she asked
one of her children to translate the instructions on the packet. She said that,
if she had been told
by the doctors, she would have made sure the instructions
were adhered to.
BOARD’S DECISION:
243 In order to be satisfied that the continued treatment of a person as an
involuntary patient subject to an community treatment
order is necessary, the
Board must be satisfied that the criteria in s8(1) of the Act have been met. The
Board considered each of
the criteria in turn.
1. Section 8(1)(a)
Does P appear to be mentally ill?
244 Section 8(1A) states:
"Subject to sub-section (2), a person is mentally ill if he or she has a
mental illness, being a medical condition that is characterised
by a significant
disturbance of thought, mood, perception or memory."
245 The Board considered the exclusionary criteria in s8(2) and has decided
that these were not relevant in this case. This was notwithstanding
Moglia’s suggestion of alternative causes of P’s sexualised
behaviour symptoms, including intellectual disability.
In this regard, the
Board accepted the weight of medical evidence to the effect that the most likely
cause was his mental illness.
246 There was abundant material in the written Report on Involuntary Status
and the oral evidence of five consultant psychiatrists
- including two
authorised psychiatrists, two delegated psychiatrists heading P’s treating
teams and Dr DSu, a highly regarded
forensic psychiatrist, on whose secondary
consultations the treating teams have relied in respect of the treatment of P
Provera - that the diagnosis for P’s mental illness continues to
be paranoid schizophrenia. Although his symptoms are currently
partially controlled on medication, in the past P’s condition was
characterised by a significant disturbance of thought
and perception, with
symptoms reported as "psychosocial decline, talking to self, auditory
hallucinations or ‘voices’,
disorganised behaviour, sexual
disinhibition and aggressive behaviour".
247 On P’s behalf, Mr Moglia fairly raised the question about the cause
of the sexual disinhibition and behaviour which led
to his offending in 2001.
He noted that the evidence about these issues was not always direct, and
opinions varied as to a connection
between this behaviour and a mental illness.
In essence, despite this, he did not argue with any strength that P did not have
mental illness. P himself gave evidence that he believed he had had
schizophrenia, but did not any longer. By contrast, Ms Doyle
suggested that
there was abundant evidence to support the diagnosis even in the absence of a
finding about the connection between
sexual disinhibition and the diagnosed
248 To the extent that it is necessary, notwithstanding the lack of clarity
in the totality of the medical evidence, the Board accepted
opinion (supported as it was by several other specialist opinions) that it is
more likely that the symptoms of sexual
disinhibition are linked with the
diagnosed illness of schizophrenia than any other cause. Accepting the
difficulties of certainty
in the context of the continued use of Depo Provera,
the most compelling evidence appeared to be the relationship between the control
of P’s psychotic symptoms and the improved control of his sexualised
249 Irrespective of this aspect, the Board accepted the well documented
history of mental illness. The Act defines a person as mentally
ill if they have
a significant disturbance of thought, mood, perception or memory. If the person
has a condition characterised by
a significant disturbance of any one of these,
they satisfy the legal test of appearing to be mentally ill. On the evidence
it, the Board was satisfied that P has a mental illness, and appears to
be mentally ill. Accordingly this criterion was met.
2. Section 8(1)(b)
Does P's mental illness require immediate treatment and can that
treatment be obtained by P being subject to an involuntary treatment
250 The word "treatment" is defined in s3 of the Act as follows:
"treatment", in relation to a mental disorder, means things done in the
course of the exercise of professional skills to
(a) remedy the mental disorder; or
(b) lessen its ill-effects or the pain
and suffering which it causes.
251 An important issue raised in this case was whether treatment with Depo
Provera was required in order to treat P’s mental
illness. At various
stages during the hearing, Mr Moglia closely questioned witnesses about the link
between his alleged sexual
disinhibition and the diagnosed mental illness. He
proposed that there might be other causes such as a brain injury or frontal lobe
syndrome, and did not concede that treatment with Depo Provera should be
required as part of the treatment plan for P’s mental
252 Having accepted that the balance of evidence favours the view that the
symptoms of sexual disinhibition are more likely related
to the mental illness
than other proposed causes, the Board was satisfied that P’s current
medical condition is such that he
continues to require treatment, including the
administration of medication, close monitoring of his mental state and
psychoeducation.
253 The Board was satisfied that P continues to require treatment to
ameliorate the symptoms of his mental illness, and to prevent
a deterioration in
his mental health. It noted the clear evidence that P's mental health and
behaviour had benefited from the administration
of medication and the support
provided by the mental health services. Dr DS highlighted the point that, under
the involuntary treatment
orders, the treating teams have been able to
progressively manage P in a less restrictive manner, as evidenced by his move
highly restricted environment of Thomas Embling Hospital to a secure
extended care unit, to a community care unit, to a supported
residential
service, and recently to return home to live with his mother and siblings. In
each environment, the level of restriction
has reduced, and the capacity of P to
develop and maintain his skills of self care have increased, together with his
freedom to undertake
activities in a more normal manner.
254 This evidence supported the Board’s view that P’s treatment
is being, and can be, obtained by being subject to a community
treatment order.
Accordingly this criterion was met.
3. Section 8(1)(c)
Because of P's mental illness, is involuntary treatment of P necessary
for his/her health or safety (whether to prevent a deterioration
in his physical
or mental condition or otherwise) or for the protection of members of the
255 There was considerable discussion during the hearing about the risks
associated with P’s sexually disinhibited behaviour.
Mr Moglia was
critical of the basis on which it had been categorised by the treating teams,
that is the quality of the evidence
used to support the assessment of risk to
others, as well as what he saw as the lack of a principled or objective process
for assessing
risk in P’s case.
256 At its worst, if it were to reach the level of criminal behaviour as
occurred in 2001, or worse, in the Board's view, clearly
an elevation in such
behaviour has the potential to place members of the community at risk. Dr DSu
asserted that there was at least
an equal risk that such behaviour could place P
at risk of injury, assault or possible victimisation by others reacting to his
disinhibited
behaviour. He made a clear connection between P becoming unwell,
and such an increased risk of re-offending or being the victim
of assault.
257 Leaving aside those matters, the evidence of KH contrasting P’s
current situation of relative wellness with his disorganised
thinking and
behaviour at the time that she first took him to EPPIC in 2000 reinforced the
Board’s view that an exacerbation
of his symptoms of schizophrenia is
likely to inevitably lead to a serious deterioration in his self care,
functioning and capacity
to relate to, and live successfully with, his family.
Given the progress that he has made in recent years, such a decline would
nothing short of a tragedy.
258 The Board noted P’s clearly expressed dislike for the current
medication regime, which was consistent with the treating
teams’ evidence
of their various discussions with him about his attitude to continuing with
treatment voluntarily. In addition
to the treatment for his mental illness, P
requires active and regular treatment for diabetes. The Board was not confident
if he were not subject to the community treatment order, P would continue
to regularly take his prescribed medication for either
his mental or physical
health issues. Given his attitude to medication, and the evidence, particularly
from GP Dr NH, that P’s
capacity for self care and managing his medication
requires close monitoring and considerable support from his mother, the Board
was satisfied that, if he were not subject to the community treatment order, the
risk of deterioration in his mental state remains
very real. The consequences of
such a deterioration would be a risk to P’s mental and physical health,
his safety, and, on
the basis of the history, potentially the safety of members
of the public. Accordingly this criterion was met.
4. Section 8(1)(d)
Has P refused or is he unable to consent to the necessary treatment for
the mental illness?
259 In considering whether a person is in fact consenting to treatment, the
Board must be satisfied that the person is able to consent
to treatment. In
Re the Review
of MB (unreported MHRBD 13 November
, the Board expressed this as follows:
“To be able to consent a patient must be aware of the extent of
their illness and be aware of its nature to the extent they
can recognize those
aspects of behaviour that are symptomatic of the existence of that illness. In
addition they must understand
the changes in symptoms that the treatment is
intended to bring about.”
260 The Board carefully considered whether P is capable of giving informed
consent to treatment. This involves a person being
aware of the nature
and extent of their illness. P stated in his evidence to the Board that he
accepted that he had had a mental
illness in the past, but now thought himself
well. Although he expressed the view that he needs treatment, on questioning he
candid in his view that he would not continue injections if he were not
required to. He displayed considerable ambivalence to his
current psychiatric
medication and lacked a realistic appreciation of what treatment would be
required to treat his condition.
261 In the Board's view, P’s evidence reflected very limited
understanding of his condition, consistent with the observations
of the treating
team over the years. There was considerable discussion during the hearing about
the level of P’s intellectual
capacity, and its effect on his
decision-making skills, particularly his executive and reasoning functions.
Unlike some mental health
legislation, the Act does not require lack of capacity
to consent to be directly related to the mental illness. On the basis of
the evidence, the Board concluded that P was not sufficiently aware of the
nature and extent of his illness, nor the underlying
purpose of the treatment.
He did not inspire confidence in the Board that he was committed to the type of
ongoing treatment that
is required to treat his condition.
262 As a result, the Board concluded that P does not have sufficient
understanding of the nature and extent of his illness or the
purpose of the
treatment to be capable of giving informed consent to the necessary treatment.
This criterion was therefore satisfied.
5. Section 8(1)(e)
Is P unable to receive adequate treatment for the mental illness in a
manner less restrictive of his freedom of decision and action?
263 On behalf of P, Mr Moglia initially submitted that P could receive
adequate treatment in a manner that was less restrictive of
his freedom of
decision or action, although he did not press the point towards the end of the
hearing. He conceded that, irrespective
of the Board’s decision about the
continued treatment with Depo Provera, there were difficulties arguing for
discharge from
the community treatment order.
264 There was compelling evidence before the Board from the treating team
that the use of involuntary treatment over a number of years
has facilitated P
returning to live with, and reengage well with, his mother and his family. In
the Board’s view, the incremental
steps by which P has gone from the most
highly restricted environment of the Thomas Embling Hospital to living in a
community with
the support of his family reflect considerable credit on both P
and his family and the members of the various treating teams. However,
evidence supported the conclusion that there continues to be a demonstrable need
for considerable support and monitoring of P
to maintain his life in the
community at a reasonably functional level. In respect of his mental health, P
continues to require
monitoring of his mental state, his treatment, including
all medication, and assistance with daily living skills. In respect of
physical health, GP Dr NH suggested that P continues to require monitoring of
his blood sugar levels, and his medication. On
top of these important issues,
Mr Moglia made a compelling argument that P requires close and systematic
monitoring of the effect
of his mental health treatment on his bone density, and
the risks associated with osteoporosis.
265 The Board accepted that P has very limited insight into his health
conditions and the need for ongoing treatment, and remained
concerned that,
without the compulsion that the community treatment order provides, he would not
be able to receive the range of
treatments that he requires. In the
Board’s view, without continuing involuntary status, P is likely to
disengage from treatment
over time, creating significant pressures on his family
relationships. In that circumstance, the Board was satisfied that P would
unlikely to continue to receive adequate treatment for his mental illness.
266 Accordingly, the Board was satisfied that P cannot receive adequate
treatment for his mental illness in a manner less restrictive
of his freedom of
decision and action than as an involuntary patient subject to a community
treatment order. This criterion was
therefore met.
267 As all of the s8(1) criteria were satisfied, the Board must order the
continuation of P’s community treatment order.
Review of Treatment Plan
268 In reviewing a patient's treatment plan, the Board must be satisfied that
the requirements of s35A(1) of the Act have been met.
The Board considered each
of the requirements in turn.
1. Section 35A(1)(a)
Has the authorised psychiatrist complied with sl9A in making, reviewing
or revising the plan (as the case may be)?
269 On behalf of P, Mr Moglia asserted that the treating team had not
complied with all the requirements of s19A in that P’s
wishes had not been
taken into account, the treatment being carried out was not only to promote and
maintain P’s health or
well-being and that alternative treatments had not
been considered. By implication, he also argued that the level of significance
of the risks associated with treatment with Depo Provera or its alternatives had
not been appropriately considered. Mr Moglia reinforced
this position with his
final additional submission received by the Board on 10 February 2009.
270 On 13 January 2009, the Board received a request from the solicitor
acting for the treating services to have the opportunity to
provide a final
submission in respect of the arguments put on behalf of P on the last hearing
day concerning P’s treatment
plan and the prescription and monitoring of
medication for his physical health issues.
271 On 30 January 2009, the Board received the additional submission which
noted (in paragraph 1) that the psychiatrist member questioned
P about "the
method and timing of the administration of certain medications used to treat his
physical health issues, including medications
used to maintain or improve his
bone density" and that no evidence had been led about this issue from any other
witness. He further
noted that it appeared from the questions that P "may not
have been taking these medications so as to make them most effective".
272 The submission then noted (in paragraph 2) the submission of Counsel for
P to the effect that the area mental health services
should have "created
treatment plans which gave further information about the proper methods of
administration of various medications
used to treat (P’s) physical health
issues" and that the treatment plans did not comply with s19A because they did
not contain
this information.
273 To this, in short, the services argued (in paragraph 3) that there was no
evidence adduced from witnesses from the area mental
health services or
P’s other treaters, including his GP or endocrinologists, to establish
what information P was given about
the administration of medications to treat
physical health issues. Further, it was argued that s19A "does not require area
health services to provide information about administration of
medications to treat physical health issues". In the alternative,
it was argued
that it "would not be desirable for area mental health services to be required
to provide (such) information".
274 The submission went on to advise the Board that the relevant part of the
most recent treatment plan "is not contained on the most
recent formal treatment
plan form, but is instead contained in the Report on Involuntary Status dated 7
October 2008 at part 2.6".
It sets out three specific medications with dosages,
including for Fosamax, and it noted that no evidence from staff was obtained
to what information was in fact provided to P about the administration of these
medications.
275 In paragraphs 7-14, the submission strongly argued about what was and was
not required by s19A and what was and what was not appropriate
for an authorised
psychiatrist drafting a treatment plan to "stipulate" in relation to "a
particular method of administration for
every medication forming part of the
treatment plan", suggesting that "it is appropriate for such information to be
given by the
patient's general practitioner (or by a specialist in the relevant
area) ..., on the basis that they have greater expertise in treating
health issues and would usually be more familiar with an individual
patient’s physical health than an authorised psychiatrist
or delegate.
276 The submission also noted that relevant information "might also be
available to a patient from labels and other information on
the packaging" and
that case managers provide various forms of assistance, such as to:
arrange and
monitor regular attendance at the patient’s general practitioner
arrange access
to a specialist if needed
take a patient
to his or her appointments with general practitioners or specialists
act as a liaison
between the patient and his or her general practitioner or specialist to ensure
that the patient understands his
treatment and the proposals or orders by
doctors are acted upon.
277 Finally, the submission noted that P’s case managers
"have frequently performed these services for him. (P) and his representatives
have raised no complaints about any actions or omissions by the case
278 Having forwarded the submission to P’s legal representative, the
Board received its response on 10 February 2009. In it,
Mr Moglia argued, under
the heading, obligations with respect to non-psychiatric care or treatment:
in the event
that the Board decided that the administration of Depo Provera is authorised,
the “Treatment Plan necessarily must
encompass ‘restorative’
treatment. The kind of restorative treatment captured by this obligation
includes any treatment
that is directly linked to the depo-provera. Where a
medication is administered with the sole or substantial purpose of counteracting
a detrimental side-effect of the depo-provera (here, Fosamax, etc), there is a
direct link sufficient to bring it within the matters
to be contained in the
Treatment Plan”
he noted that a
range of restorative treatment by way of medication (eg Fosamax) is already
included in the treatment plan and asserted
that “(P)roviding a patient
with information about prescribed medication and its administration is an
essential part of medical
treatment. It is incumbent on those responsible for
the treatment to ensure that the treatment is complete, that is, it includes
relevant information and advice. So much is simply a normal and necessary part
of medical practice.”
he referred the
Board to the Chief Psychiatrist’s Guideline,
General medical health
needs, annual examination, non-psychiatric treatment, special procedures and
medical research procedures
, which states, ‘The authorised
psychiatrist maintains a responsibility for the physical as well as the mental
health of patients’
(p 2, para 2). The Mental Health Service is obliged to
actively monitor side effects (p3) and conduct an annual examination to
any side effects of treatment can be identified and appropriately
managed’ (p5). He also asserted that “active monitoring
side-effects and management of them is essential to ‘best possible care
and treatment appropriate to [a patient’s]
needs' (s 4 of the
he went on to
argue that “(T)he evidence demonstrated that bone density had not been
monitored annually. Further, both the Mental
Health Service and the GP denied
the responsibility for monitoring the compliance with or efficacy of the Fosamax
treatment.”
He did not submit that the authorised psychiatrist must carry
out all tasks in relation to management of side-effects, but stated,
“(C)learly, a family GP may well be best suited to some aspects of the
overall treatment. What is objectionable is that neither
the Mental Health
Service nor the GP take responsibility for active monitoring P’s
compliance with and the efficacy of the
restorative treatment.”
he correctly
noted that the treatment plan must contain or specify who is to monitor the
patient’s treatment (s19A(4)(b) and
(c)), suggesting that a treatment plan
that does not do so should be reviewed so that essential elements of the
treatment do not
‘fall through the cracks’ as seems to have occurred
with respect to the monitoring of the restorative treatment prescribed
he went further
to suggest that a treatment plan that “does not provide for such
monitoring suggests that the authorized psychiatrist
has not appropriately
considered the reality of the ‘nature and degree of any significant risks
associated with the treatment’
(s 19A(2)(e))”.
referring to his previous submissions and case law, he asserted that “(I)n
circumstances where involuntary treatment
has known detrimental side-effects and
the side-effects are capable of being treated, the steps taken to ensure or
monitor restorative
treatment is an influential matter when determining whether
the treatment amounts to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.”
Therefore, “the Mental Health Service cannot ‘blow hot and
cold’ by, on the one hand, claiming that depo-provera
is essential to the
treatment of P’s mental illness (a treatment that has ‘no effect on
his psychotic condition’:
Statement of Dr DSu, 12 October 2008
on the other denying responsibility for addressing the harm it does or the
efficacy of restorative treatment. Such an approach
seems out of touch with the
medical profession’s duty of care.”
279 In considering
these submissions, the Board makes no criticism of the treating teams in respect
of the support they have provided
to P in almost every respect. In general, it
does not disagree with the basic submission about the requirements of s19A put
of the treating services. However, as has been explained above, in
the circumstances of P’s case, and any similar cases where
the treatment
provided for the mental illness has serious, detrimental and potentially
permanent physical consequences, which are
known to the treating services, they
are not in a position to assume that P’s general practitioner and relevant
physical health
specialists are in complete control of the advice and monitoring
of medications being prescribed by them for P's physical health
including the most effective methods of administering them.
280 In this respect, the Board is in entire agreement with the tenor of Mr
Moglia's submission. In the Board's view, whilst the general
practitioner and
the relevant physical health specialists may have the primary obligation in this
regard to provide the practical
advice and monitoring of the medications,
including the most effective methods of administering them, there remains an
on the authorised psychiatrist to ensure that the treatment plan is
crystal clear as to how those obligations will be fulfilled and
relationship between the treating team and external treaters will be managed.
This level of specificity is required to ensure
as far as possible that all
reasonable contingencies are covered to reduce the possibility of negative
outcomes for P as a direct
result of the effects of the treating teams’
treatment, care and management of his mental illness.
281 Turning to the specific requirements of s19A, s19A(1) requires that the
authorised psychiatrist must prepare, review on a regular
basis and revise as
required, a treatment plan for each patient. Section 19A(2) states that, in
preparing reviewing and revising
a treatment plan, the authorised psychiatrist
must take into account six matters:
- the wishes of the patient as far as they can be ascertained (sub-section
- (unless the patient objects) the wishes of any guardian, family member or
primary carer involved in providing ongoing care or support
(sub-section
- whether the treatment to be carried out is only to promote and maintain the
patient’s health or well-being (sub-section (c));
- any beneficial alternative treatments available (sub-section (d)); and
- the nature and degree of any significant risks associated with the treatment
or any alternative treatment (sub-section (e)).
282 Sub-section (f) adds "any prescribed matters", but to date
there are none.
283 If the Board is satisfied that the authorised psychiatrist has not
complied with section 19A, it may order the authorised psychiatrist
the treatment plan [s35A(2)].
284 The Board had before it two treatment plans for P, the first dated 21
August 2008 and the second dated 7 October 2008. They were
both prepared in
similar form by case manager, SC, and authorised by consultant psychiatrist, Dr
AM. Both referred to the joint
treatment arrangements between Saltwater Clinic
and Waratah Clinic, but neither noted as "Other Parties to the Plan" P’s
KH or GP, Dr NH, both of whom were conceded in the hearing to be
important to its successful implementation. Both included a review
date, namely
20 October 2008 and 7 January 2009 respectively.
285 It was self-evident that treatment planning has been complicated by the
extended transition of care between the two treating teams,
necessitated in part
by this hearing. Nonetheless, efforts at an effective collaboration to maintain
P’s mental and physical
health appear to have been successful to date.
286 In respect of P’s medication, both treatment plans mentioned
Risperdal Consta 62.5mg IMI 2/52, meaning at a dose of 62.5
milligrams injected
intramuscularly every two weeks, and Depo Provera. In the first plan, the
dosage was recorded as "200mg IMI
1/52 (gradually being tapered off as per
recommendations of Forensic Psychiatrist)" and in the second plan as "300mg
INTRAMUSCULAR
INJECTION WEEKLY". In both plans, a long list of non-psychiatric
medications followed which included "Fosamax 70 mg weekly, Caltrate
Daily...Novamix 30 insulin 14 units morning, 10 units teatime".
287 Many matters included in each plan were repeated with identical wording,
but there were several important individual matters referred
to in each plan in
slightly different wording, including ongoing psychiatric follow-up, the
transition period for transfer to Waratah
clinic and engagement with the new
team, and the different doses of Depo Provera, reflecting the attempt to reduce
the dosage in
288 The submissions on behalf of P focussed on the serious side-effects that
P has experienced as a consequence of taking over many
years the prescribed
medication to treat his serious mental illness. Like most classes of
medications, for many patients, antipsychotic
medications can have unpleasant
side-effects which impact on their physical health. In P’s case,
fortunately, few such side-effects
from the risperidone consta have been noted
or complained of. However, it was suggested by various witnesses that it, and
antipsychotic medications, do have the effect of mildly increasing
the risk of reduction in bone density and, ultimately, the potential
development of osteoporosis.
289 Much evidence was provided to the Board about the long-term prescription
of Depo Provera to reduce the likelihood of a repetition
of P’s sexually
disinhibited behaviour which, on one occasion, led to criminal charges and a
conviction. Dr DSu expressed
the opinion that it was this medication that was
the most likely cause in P’s case of the diagnosis of osteoporosis. On
the Board accepted this opinion. Mr Moglia was adamant that Board
should find that the link, if any, between P’s observed
behaviours and
noted comments about his sexual desires and interests and his mental illness is
too tenuous to accept that the prescription
of Depo Provera can be considered a
necessary treatment for the mental illness under the Act.
290 The Board noted that the medical evidence was not entirely clear, both in
relation to the actual behaviours described over the
years as sexually
disinhibited or inappropriately sexualised and because of the variety of
possible causes proposed for P's sexually
disinhibited behaviour. These
included mental illness, brain injury, acquired brain injury, intellectual
disability, and frontal
lobe syndrome. On balance, the Board has accepted the
weight of the medical evidence that it is more likely than not connected with
his psychotic disorder. The evidence was that there was no evidence of P
exhibiting such behaviour before the diagnosis of paranoid
schizophrenia and the
offending behaviour appeared to occur in the context of poorly treated and
escalating psychotic symptoms.
Despite the less than satisfactory reporting of
P’s comments via his GP, his case manager and the registrar during the
of the trial of the reduction of Depo Provera in July and August 2008
that led to the increase of the dose, it cannot be overlooked
that, according to
the evidence, this was the third similar trial in different environments and, on
each occasion shortly after the
reduction in the dosage of Depo Provera, there
was concern expressed by the clinicians treating P about his increasing sexual
and desires accompanied by inappropriate and sexually disinhibited
behaviour. In each case, the staff was different and, even accepting
may all have been very sensitive to possible changes in P’s behaviour, the
Board concluded that the link has been
291 What flows from this finding is that the authorised psychiatrist must
regularly monitor and review the risks and benefits of the
continued treatment
of P with Depo Provera in the context of the Board’s finding that severe,
deleterious and potentially permanent
medication side-effects can potentially
constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Also, notwithstanding that
the medication
is prescribed for therapeutic purposes, in order to promote the
health and well-being of the patient, P’s treatment plan must
frequently reviewed and, when required, revised to clearly establish and
maintain a regime of regular and transparent monitoring
and review, with
responsibilities clearly specified, including GP, Dr NH, and regular external
secondary consultations such as bone
density testing and forensic psychiatric
advice as required, accompanied by an established set of principles and a
protocol for determining
how to manage the reduction, cessation and
reinstitution of P’s Depo Provera in changing clinical circumstances.
292 Turning specifically to Mr Moglia’s and Ms Doyle’s
submissions and the requirements of s19A, although s19A(2)(a) requires
authorised psychiatrist must
take into account
the wishes of the patient,
it does not require that the treatment plan reflect or accede to the wishes of
the patient. The nature
of an involuntary treatment order is commonly that the
treatment required for a patient is not what the patient would choose for
himself or herself. The Board noted the evidence provided at the hearing that
the treating team has had regular conversations with
P about his treatment. The
Board was not of the view that the treating team’s refusal or failure to
accede to P’s wishes
in relation to his treatment required an order to
remedy the situation. Further, it was satisfied that P’s wishes have been
considered and taken into account in determining his treatment and in developing
his treatment plan, as evidenced by the decision
to again effect a reduction in
the dosage of Depo Provera.
293 On the available evidence, the Board accepted that the treatment team was
in contact with P’s mother and that the most recent
treatment plan has
also taken into account her wishes. The requirement of s19A(2)(b) was met.
294 With respect to s19A(2)(c) and the question of whether the treatment to
be carried out was only to promote and maintain P’s
health or well-being,
the Board noted the submissions and concerns surrounding P’s lengthy
treatment with Depo Provera. It
also noted as appropriate Mr Moglia’s
concession that the medication was being prescribed for therapeutic reasons.
not defined in the Act, the Board has previously concluded that, by the
use of the words “health or well-being”, s19A(2)(c)
contemplates
consideration of a broader range of matters not confined to the physical and
mental health of the patient. Whilst satisfied
that it is the health or
well-being of the patient that is to be considered, “well-being” can
include a range of matters
relevant to that patient such as, but not limited to,
their health, safety and quality of life.
295 The Board agreed with the view expressed by previous divisions of the
Board that s19A(2)(c) allows it to consider a range of matters
including the
whole of the treatment, the aim of the treatment, the balance between
therapeutic and effective treatment and any negative
side effects, and how the
planned treatment affects the patient’s mental and physical health, their
safety and quality of life.
That is, it is appropriate to consider whether, on
balance, the proposed treatment as a whole has the objective of promoting and
maintaining a patient’s overall health or well-being. As a result of its
detailed considerations in this case, the Board
adds to the matters relevant to
whether treatment is "only to promote and maintain the patient's health or
well-being" both the protection
of P’s Charter rights in general, and the
possibility that his treatment may become or be characterised as cruel, inhuman
degrading in particular.
296 P’s case involves considerable complexity, given the history of his
mental illness, behaviours which had resulted in a criminal
conviction in the
past and the side effects of the medication, in particular the continuing use of
Depo Provera. The Board concluded
that the treating teams had considered
P’s history and taken into account past treatment, the forensic opinions
and recommendations,
the serious physical side-effects of his current treatment
and P’s physical and mental state over time. On the evidence before
the treatment plan which included the continued use of 300mg of Depo Provera
weekly appropriately weighed up the positive and
negative effects on P’s
mental and physical health and well-being. The Board was satisfied that
P’s treatment was designed
only to promote and maintain P’s health
or well-being.
297 However, given its findings in this case, the Board agreed with Mr
Moglia’s concerns for the future. It was of the view
that, to continue to
fulfil the requirements of the section, the treating team must take a much more
proactive role in reviewing
and revising the treatment plan to ensure continuing
seamless monitoring and liaison between the treating team and external treaters
such as GP, Dr NH, and relevant forensic and bone density specialists of both
the mental health and physical health aspects of P’s
297 The Board was also satisfied, for the purpose of s19A(2)(d), that the
treatment plans as implemented by the treating teams have
taken into account
alternative treatments for P, including previous attempts to reduce the dose of
Depo Provera, consideration of
Androcur as an alternative medication,
consideration of psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy,
a behaviour
modification-based therapy, and previous changes to his
anti-psychotic medication.
298 As for s19A(2(e), the evidence of the treating team was that they are
constantly cognisant of the side effects and risks associated
with the current
treatment. At regular intervals, they had arranged appropriate specialist
referrals to monitor and advise on treatment
for P’s conditions. Although
not actively considered as a direct alternative to medication-based treatments
for the symptom
of sexual disinhibition, during the hearing it became clear that
the weight of medical evidence was clearly against the successful
implementation
of a program of cognitive behavioural therapy for P, mainly on the basis of
engagement issues, intellectual capacity
and, potentially, cultural
299 The Board noted that s19A(5) allows the authorised psychiatrist to
include in a treatment plan "anything else" that he or she
"thinks appropriate".
As explained above, the Board has always drawn a clear line between its
statutory requirement to review treatment
plans compared with the authorised
psychiatrist’s statutory role of preparing, reviewing and revising
treatment plans from
a clinical standpoint. Nonetheless, for the reasons
explained in detail in this statement of reasons, in a case such as P’s,
the Board has every reason to expect that the authorised psychiatrist would use
this broad facilitative provision to provide the
detail necessary so that all
members of the treating team, together with all related external medical and
support personnel, are
fully aware of their roles and responsibilities in
relation to every aspect of P’s treatment, both as to actions and
decision-making,
to minimise the possibility of poor communication, liaison or
interaction between them. The potential dangers inherent in anything
a rigorous and seamlessly implemented treatment plan could result in dire
consequences for P’s health, and potentially
lead to significant issues
for the responsible mental health service and the government.
300 In the Board’s view, this not only extends to treatment and
assessment of P’s mental and physical health, but to the
processes for
providing advice to P and his family about their understanding of the treatment
plan and their own role in the proper
and effective administration of medication
in accordance with prescription, the monitoring of P, both in relation to
compliance and
also in relation to the effective administration of medication,
the reporting and liaison responsibilities for all aspects of P’s
treatment, and the regular review and revision of the treatment plan to take
account of developments that occur. Consideration of
a means of reasonably
meeting P’s legitimate privacy and family rights could also be given as
part of this process.
301 For the reasons given, and without in any way reflecting criticism on the
significant efforts to date of both treating teams operating
under challenging
circumstances, the Board could not be satisfied that the most recent treatment
plan has taken into account all
of the matters required by s19A(2) that are
specifically relevant to P’s complex mental health and physical health
Accordingly the Board was not satisfied that the authorised
psychiatrist had complied with s19A in preparing, reviewing and revising
P’s Treatment Plan, and ordered the authorised psychiatrist to revise the
treatment plan, taking account of the matters discussed
in this statement of
2. Section 35A(1)(b)
Is the plan capable of being implemented by the approved mental health
302 While recognising the importance of the issues discussed above in
relation to the need for a revision of P’s treatment plan,
both to bring
into effect the transition of his treatment to Inner West area mental health
service and to take account of the issues
discussed by the Board in this
statement of reasons, the Board could not help but be very impressed with the
progress P has made
under the treatment plans developed to date. Dr DS
highlighted the efforts of the treating team to engage with P in such a way as
to maintain his good mental health and provide necessary support for him and his
family, while at the same time continuing to focus
P’s treatment in a more
normal home environment. In this regard, the evidence was clear that the
treatment plans to date have
not only been capable of being implemented, but
have in fact been successfully implemented, such that P has progressed from a
restrictive treatment environment in the Thomas Embling Hospital through a
series of gradually less restrictive treatment environments
to his current
situation of living at home with his family. Both P, his family and the
treating teams involved at each stage deserve
considerable credit for this.
303 Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, the Board was not satisfied
that the authorised psychiatrist has complied with s19A
in making, reviewing or
revising the plan, and ordered the authorised psychiatrist to revise the
treatment plan on taking into account
the matters set out in this statement of
reasons. The Board is confident that further discussion between P, his family,
treating team, as well as his GP, Dr NH and other relevant specialists,
will facilitate continuing progress towards less restrictive
self-directed treatment over time.
304 As a result, as all the s8(1) criteria were met, therefore the Board made
the determination set out on page 3 above.

As outlined in
paragraph 76 of the statement of reasons, and modified at paragraph
On behalf of
P, it was strongly argued that, based on international jurisprudence mainly
related to the interpretation of Article
3 of the European Convention, there can
be no derogation of the right in s10(b). As a fallback position, it was argued
application of the s7(2) would have a similar result, as the nature of
the right is so important and fundamental that it would overwhelm
all the other
s7(2) criteria. The Services argued that the Board should consider P’s
treatment as a reasonable and justifiable
limitation on his Charter rights as
the current treatment plan appropriately takes account of the concerns regarding
side-effects
of the Depo Provera medication. This medication is being
prescribed to ameliorate a symptom referable to his diagnosed mental illness,
and therefore is of therapeutic
