Date of this report
18 June 2025
Executive summary
Wangaratta is a regional
centre in the north-west of Victoria identified for growth. Areas to the
north-west and south of Wangaratta
have been identified to accommodate that
growth. However its ability to service that growth and provide housing land
supply is constrained
by the capacity of its sewerage network.
Wangaratta Planning Scheme Amendment C86wang (the Amendment) seeks to rezone
approximately 24.3 hectares of land at the southern urban
edge of Wangaratta
from Low Density Residential Zone to the General Residential Zone to facilitate
residential development. The
planning permit for the subdivision of that land
into 233 lots, remove native vegetation and an easement and construct access to
Wangaratta-Whitfield Road is also being considered as part of this
The Amendment also proposes to rezone part of the adjacent Targoora Park to
the Public Use Zone to facilitate the construction of
a wastewater treatment
facility (WWTF). This facility will service the proposed subdivision, provide
capacity to service an additional
100 residential lots and provide treated water
for irrigation of sporting fields on Targoora Park and adjacent Cathedral
The WWTF does not require a planning permit.
Key issues raised in submissions included:
density and
extent of development and its impact on existing character
the impacts of
the WWTF including potential odours and loss of public open space
biodiversity
impacts on One
Mile Creek.
Overall, the Panel considers that the Amendment is
consistent with the Municipal Planning Strategy and Planning Policy Framework.
It will unlock short term housing supply otherwise constrained by the sewerage
network in a location well suited for greater residential
development. The
impact on public open space has been minimised by its location and small
footprint and will be offset by additional
open space provision including along
One Mile Creek.
The Amendment and draft Permit provide for an innovative wastewater
management solution which will provide additional short term housing
and the opportunity to sustainably irrigate adjacent active recreation areas.
The proposed WWTF, while subject to a separate
EPA approval, is designed to have
a low risk of potential odour or noise impact on nearby sensitive receptors.
The proposed subdivision development is an appropriate response to its
context and responds to the relevant planning policies and
Planning Scheme
provisions. Issues associated with traffic and movement, native vegetation
removal, open space provision, flooding,
stormwater, bushfire and impacts on One
Mile Creek have been mitigated through subdivision design or the draft Permit
as amended through Final Hearing Day versions and additional
condition drafting changes recommended by the Panel.
Recommendation
Based on the reasons set out in this Report, the
Panel recommends:
Wangaratta Planning Scheme Amendment C86wang as exhibited.
Issue planning permit PlnApp24/005 for the
staged multi-lot subdivision (233 lots), removal of native vegetation, removal
of an easement
and construction of access to a road within a Transport 2 Zone
subject to the permit conditions contained in Appendix D.
1 Introduction
1.1 The Amendment and permit application
Planning Scheme Amendment C86wang (the Amendment) is a combined planning scheme
amendment and planning permit application
section 96A
and Environment Act
(PE Act). It is proposed to
facilitate the residential development of land located at Lot 2 PS744661D
Wangaratta-Whitfield Road,
Wangaratta at the southern urban edge of
Wangaratta.
Specifically, the Amendment (refer Figure 1) proposes to:
rezone Lot 2
PS744661D (the Permit land, outlined in red) from Low Density Residential Zone
Schedule 1 (LDRZ1) to the General Residential
Zone Schedule 1 (GRZ1) to
facilitate the residential subdivision of that land
approximately 1.5 hectares of land within Targoora Park (330
Wangaratta-Whitfield Road, Wangaratta) (the Targoora Park land,
outlined blue)
from the Public Park and Recreation Zone (PPRZ) to the Public Use Zone (Service
and Utility) (PUZ1) to facilitate
the construction of a wastewater treatment
facility (WWTF) which will provide reticulated sewerage services for the Permit
to provide additional housing development
The Amendment land
Explanatory Report
The Rural City of Wangaratta (Council) is the Planning Authority for the
Amendment and Responsible Authority for the permit application.
Council has
prepared the Amendment at the request of Bislake Pty Ltd (the Proponent).
The Planning Permit application PlnApp24/005 (Permit application) applies to
Lot 2 PS744661D only and proposes (refer Figure 2) the:
subdivision of
land to create 230 residential lots ranging from 328 square metres to 801 square
metres and 3 medium-density ‘superlots’
ranging from 1,960 square
metres -2,349 square metres
removal of 0.179
hectares of native vegetation (as exhibited)
alteration of
access to a road in a Transport Zone 2 (Wangaratta-Whitfield Road)
removal of an
electricity transmission easement.
Other features of the Permit
application concept development plans include:
pedestrian and
cycle paths links to One Mile Creek and Wenhams Lane Reserve
a local street
connection to Milnes Creek Drive and widened Clarkes Lane
a bioretention
2.47 hectares of
unencumbered open space (as exhibited) along One Mile Creek and sections of the
northern and southern
boundaries.
Concept Development Plan (Version 15)
To reduce the electronic size of this document, Figure 2 has been removed
from this version of the report. Contact Planning Panels
Victoria to obtain a
complete copy of the report.
The Permit application does not apply to the WWTF because as a minor utility
installation a permit is not required under Clause 62.01
(Uses Not Requiring a
Planning Permit) or Clause 62.02 (Buildings and Works). The WWTF will however
require further approval under
Environment Protection Act 2017
including any discharge to treated water to One Mile Creek. The details of the
WWTF are set out in more detail in Chapters 3 and
4 of this report.

1.3 Submissions
37 submissions were
received to following exhibition of the Amendment and Permit application
(including a late submission and referral
authority submissions). Key issues
raised were:
density and
extent of development and the impact on the character of the area
including potential odours and loss of public open space
biodiversity
impacts on One
Mile Creek.
Submissions were received from the following referral
authorities:
Environment
Protection Authority Victoria (EPA) – initially opposed the proposal but
following submission of the Odour Assessment
conditionally support of the
conditional
support from GMW, NEW, DEECA, NECMA and AusNet.
1.4 Procedural issues
(i) Native vegetation removal
response to Panel Direction 6 relating to inconsistent permit application
documentation about the extent of native vegetation removal,
the Proponent
advised (D12):
The total amount of native vegetation to be removed is 0.467ha including
three scattered trees and includes removal from Lot 2 in
Plan of Subdivision
) and the road reserve adjacent the Land where access is
No native vegetation is proposed to be removed from Targoora Park comprised
in Lot 1 on Title Plan 844150 (
Targoora Park
) as confirmed in the
Preliminary Arborist Report and the Biodiversity Assessment.
Both the Preliminary Arborist Report and the Biodiversity Assessment consider
and assess native tree and vegetation impacts to both
the Land and Targoora
Park. The Study Area described in the Biodiversity Assessment references both
Targoora Park and the Land. Similarly,
Maps 1 to 5 in the Preliminary Arborist
Report show mapped vegetation on both the Land and Targoora Park.
(ii) Unencumbered public open space
In response to Panel Direction 6 relating to the
inconsistent permit application documentation about the area of unencumbered
open space, the Proponent advised (D12):
We confirm that the total amount of unencumbered public open space in the
proposal is 2.46ha or 2.47ha equivalent to 10% of the Land.
The figure of 2.47ha is set out in the post-exhibition Planning Report,9 and
the Proponent’s letter responding to submissions.10
The Concept
Development Plan11 refers to 2.46ha of public open space.
An errant reference to the previous amount of public open space (2.21ha or
9%) remained in the post-Exhibition Planning Report.12
This appears to be an
error and we confirm that the correct figure is 2.46 / 2.47ha or 10% of the
We will clarify the figure of 2.46 / 2.47ha in the Day 1 Amendment
documentation to be circulated in advance of the Panel Hearing.
(iii) AusNet easement
In response to Panel Direction 6 relating to
clarifying the changes proposed to the AusNet easement, the Proponent advised
The north-south AusNet easement is contained in Easement E-1 on Plan of
Subdivision 744661 and currently contains overhead powerlines.
The Proponent’s position in respect to Easement E-1 is set out in the
Planning Report extracted below.
2.2 Encumbering Easements (Lot 2 PS74466lD Wangaratta-Whitfield Road,
Wangaratta)
The Site is affected by an encumbering easement identified as E-1 on Plan of
Subdivision 744661D. E-1 is an electricity supply easement
in favour of the land
in LPI7871, generally measures 11-metres in width and irregularly bisects the
south-eastern portion of the
'Easement E-1 protects an existing overhead (north/south) electricity
transmission line and a previously proposed (south-west / north-east
transmission line that has not been constructed. It is understood that the
proposed (south-west/north-east) transmission line is
no longer required to
service the school while the existing (north/south) electricity transmission
lines are likely to be rerouted
underground (to an existing pole at the front of
the Cathedral College as part of the development of the Site. As
Easement E-I is not considered to impact the potential development of the Site
and will likely be removed prior to the commencement
of development.
The Proponent understands that AusNet requires a masterplan review process to
be undertaken which would incorporate the overhead powerlines
being redirected
to the east and that the easement would be removed as part of the powerline
relocation. Accordingly, the Proponent
seeks a permit condition for this process
to be undertaken with AusNet at an appropriate time.
We have made inquiries of Council in respect to AusNet comments received by
Council in respect to the proposed Amendment to confirm
that the Proponent and
Planning Panels is apprised of all relevant referral comments.
Council has advised that the original submission received from AusNet has
been misplaced in Council’s records, although it does
have record of
receiving a submission.
We understand that Council contacted AusNet directly and Council was advised
that the following
documents were submitted by AusNet on 13
January 2025 in response to its query:
Rapid Earth
Fault Current Limiter (REFCL) Industry Briefing March 2022; and
Wangaratta Area
GIS 1to5000.
The Proponent will include an appropriate permit
condition in the ‘Day 1’ version of the Amendment documentation in
regard and will liaise with AusNet and Council in respect to the proposed
permit condition.
The Proponent notes that the post-Exhibition letter from Council to the
Proponent dated 21 June 2024 provides:
AusNet • REFCL
The submission from Ausnet requires changes to the plan of subdivision to
incorporate a reserve for a REFCL transformer near the sites
Wangaratta-Whitfield Road interface (refer to submission for exact
requirements). Any reserve to accommodate the REFCL:
considered encumbered and therefore will not be counted as open space.
Must Detail
urban design treatments to integrate the facility into the surrounding
Siting of any
facility must not require the removal of native
Consideration should also, be given to the location of
the other required 300KVA kiosks within the subdivision and provision made
them within any re-design.
The Concept Development Plan Version 17 (12 July 2024) submitted to Council
with post-Exhibition Submission 08 responds to AusNet’s
comments in
respect to the REFCL by incorporating the proposed REFCL at the north-west edge
of the public open space in the south-east
corner of the Land, as shown in the
extract below.
(iv) Bushfire advice
The Panel wrote to the Country Fire Authority (CFA)
as requested by Council on the 26 March 2025 seeking a response to
earlier referral (D14). The CFA advised on 11 April 2025 that
the Permit land is within a Fire Rescue Victoria (FRV) area of responsibility
and forwarded the Panel’s correspondence to FRV (D16). Despite further
attempts from Council and the Proponent to obtain a
response from FRV no
response was received during the Hearing. Because the Permit land is not within
a Bushfire Management Overlay
but is within a Bushfire Probe Area, the only
Permit application referral for bushfire (albeit to the CFA) is where the Clause
Standard 29 for the provision of fire hydrants is not met. In this
context Council was requested to identify appropriate conditions
based on the
provisions of Standard 29 and the Bushfire Report.
On 10 June 2025 the Panel was advised that FRV had reviewed the exhibited
Bushfire Report and proposed conditions proposed by Council
in its final version
of the draft Permit. Bushfire considerations are discussed in Chapter 6 of this
(v) Day 1 Hearing version of the draft Permit
Council provided a Day 1 Hearing version of the
draft Permit (D24) which amended the conditions of the draft Permit including
referral authority conditions. The key changes to the exhibited
version are summarised in Table 3:
Day 1 changes to the draft Permit
New condition relating to future gas connections (to reflect Clause

Notes added for GMW and NECMA
The Proponent provided its amended version of the draft Permit based on
Council’s Day 1 version which proposed changes to conditions
based on its
traffic evidence. It also provided an annotated Concept Plan (version 17) (D30)
included in Figure 3, which identified
changes for the Permit land to respond to
additional technical documentation and submissions including:
revising the
area and dimensions of open space areas
identifying a
maintenance access to Cathedral College and fencing detail to common boundaries
with the school
identifying the
location of five kiosks and a REFCL to accommodate AusNet infrastructure
Exclusion Zones on lots 211-214
identifying
additional surveyed trees
simplifying the
line-marking detail for Clarkes Lane.
The Panel has based its
discussion and recommendations on Council’s Day 1 version informed by the
Final Day versions provided
by Council (D41) and the Proponent (D39) and
subsequent drafting submissions. The draft Permit is discussed in more detail

(i) Victoria’s Housing Statement
State Government Housing Statement sets a target to deliver 800,000 homes across
Victoria over the next ten years
(2024 to 2034). The Housing Statement also
sets a longer-term target of 2.24 million homes by 2051, of which, 425,600 homes
expected to be delivered across Victoria’s regional areas. The draft
target for Wangaratta Rural City Council is 6,000 homes.
(ii) Hume Regional Growth Plan
The Hume Regional Growth Plan is a ‘Policy
Document’ under Clause 11.01-1S (Settlement) and a ‘Background
under Clause 72.08 of the Planning Scheme. It provides a 30 year
direction for land use and development across the region and more

2.3 Strategic justification
(i) Evidence and submissions
submissions opposed the Amendment considering that:
provide a strategic basis for rezoning the land from LDRZ to GRZ1 and would
reduce the availability of LDRZ land in Wangaratta
to three disjointed
there was no
need for the proposed subdivision to meet housing targets
the existing
LDRZ should be retained
the existing
PPRZ should remain.
Council’s submissions explained the
strategic context for the Amendment:
the 2013 Housing
Strategy identified two greenfield areas for short to medium term growth –
the North West and South Growth
Amendment C71
gazetted in 2019 implemented the Wangaratta North West and South Growth Area
Structure Plans applying the GRZ1 to both
areas to accommodate approximately
2,285 residential lots
sewerage network capacity constraints had resulted in a high level of
uncertainty about the future growth of the two growth
Council had been working with NEW to find short term solutions to alleviate pipe
and pump capacity issues to enable the
delivery of new housing lots. This
included installing large storage tanks in the growth areas with NEW reviewing
its longer term
infrastructure needs
Victoria’s Housing Statement target of 6,000 new dwellings to 2051 would
be met through greenfield development, infill and
township growth
the North west
Long Term Growth Area was under investigation and had the future capacity to
accommodate up to 4,800 lots
the Low Density
and Rural Living Strategy, 2021 (rural component) identifies additional LDRZ
land supply in several townships to be
implemented in part by Planning Scheme
Amendments C83wang and C95wang
investigation had identified the land to the south of the subject land on the
south side of Clarks Road for potential rezoning
to LDRZ and Rural Living Zone
subject to the preparation of a Precinct Plan.
The planning evidence
of Ms Rigo concluded:
The proposed
amendment is strategically justified and will facilitate an outcome aligned with
urban consolidation policies in an area
already zoned for residential use and
identified for future growth
The proposed
subdivision is an acceptable outcome having regard to the relevant planning
policy and physical context of the site and
surrounds, and appropriately
balances the various policies seeking to provide for housing, the protection of
biodiversity, environmental
risks (bushfire and flooding) and a functional,
environmentally sustainable and attractive residential environment
She considered the Amendment:
was consistent
with the directions in the Hume Regional Growth Plan
policies directing the municipality’s growth to Wangaratta
addressed a
critical shortage of housing in Wangaratta and helped achieve the State
Government housing targets for the municipality
made better use
of an otherwise underutilised residential area (250 lots as opposed to an 80 lot
yield under the LDRZ) within the
urban boundary of the town and which would
complement the South Growth Area in particular and the North West Growth Area in
of housing supply in the short-medium term
would facilitate
the WWTF which would provide for additional short term housing capacity and
irrigation of playing fields
would deliver
positive social, economic and environmental benefits.
The Proponent
the Amendment
would result in an additional 170 lots than could be provided in the LDRZ
additional housing supply opportunity, in a strategically desirable location,
was both logical and positive, irrespective
of other supply and where
constraints were properly managed as proposed
there were no
character or significant constraints that would point against a GRZ1 housing
application of the PUZ was not required (as the WWTF did not need a permit in
either the PPRZ or PUZ) it reflected Council’s
preference for the PUZ
reflecting the ownership and operation of the WWTF by NEW.
(ii) Discussion
While the Permit land is not specifically identified
for growth within the Planning Scheme including the Wangaratta Regional City
plan, this is not a basis to not support the Amendment. This is because
strategically:
the majority of
the municipality’s growth is to be directed to Wangaratta as a Regional
City consistent with the Municipal Planning
the Permit land
is within an identified growth front in the Hume Regional Growth Plan
significant infrastructure constraints that are impacting the release of land
for housing which the Amendment and draft
Permit seek to address
release of Victoria’s Housing Statement now introduces a target of 6,000
new dwellings for the municipality by 2051.
The locational context
of the land is relevant to its potential role in accommodating future growth.
The Permit land is:
already within a
residential zone
southern urban edge of Wangaratta as determined by the application of
residential zones (GRZ1 and LDRZ) and the southern
extent of the South Growth
Area to Clarkes Lane
school, extensive areas of open space and an arterial road which links the
Wangaratta Central Activities Area with the Hume
has relatively
few constraints to more intense residential development.
these characteristics the Permit land presents as an infill site. The Amendment
provides an opportunity for the Permit land
to make effective use of existing
infrastructure and provide a positive contribution to addressing short term
housing supply than
would otherwise be achieved through the existing zone. Such
an outcome is consistent with clauses 11.01 and 16.01.
The GRZ1 is the most logical residential zone to apply to the Permit land.
It is consistent with:
the zoning of
established residential areas to the north and applied to the North West and
South Growth Areas
the guidance of
Planning Practice Note 91.
Applying the GRZ1 further ensures key
characteristics including garden area requirements and building heights are
appropriately managed.
Interface issues with One Mile Creek and larger lot
areas to the south and west can be appropriately managed through subdivision
design as discussed further in this report.
The Amendment does not prejudice the growth area planning for Wangaratta.
The North West and South Growth Areas collectively provide
2,285 lots for new
dwellings well below that required to meet the Housing Statement target for
Wangaratta (assuming 90 per cent of
that target will be accommodated within
Wangaratta). While the North West Growth Area will make a substantial
contribution to meeting
the housing target in the longer term and beyond 2051,
planning of this area remains in its early stages. It is both logical and
consistent with local and state policy to support infill growth where the
opportunity exists ahead of additional longer term greenfield
The Panel is not concerned that the Amendment will remove an area of LDRZ
from the periphery of Wangaratta. While Council identified
that demand for LDRZ
land remains strong, its overall supply in Wangaratta is not the basis for land
being used more efficiently
to provide for greater housing supply where it is
needed. Council advised that rezoning and planning for the provision of
LDRZ land supply at several townships was in progress consistent with
its settlement framework in addition to current investigative
work to the south
of Clarkes Lane. The Panel is satisfied that this strategic issue is being
appropriately managed by Council.
One of the strategic benefits of the Amendment is to provide for an
innovative approach to addressing a significant servicing constraint
restricting
the delivery of short term housing supply. The proposed WWTF to be facilitated
by this Amendment through the application
of the PUZ1 unlocks the ability to
deliver land for housing and increase the capacity of the sewerage network to
support an additional
100 lots in the short term.
As identified by the Proponent, while the PUZ1 may not be required to allow
for the WWTF to be provided without a planning permit,
it recognises that the
facility is likely to be in place for some time and will be owned and operated
by NEW rather than Council.
Other policy considerations relevant to the Amendment and draft Permit
associated with native vegetation, flooding, bushfire, open
space and transport
are able to be addressed through the development response and Permit conditions
as discussed in subsequent chapters
of this report.
Overall, the Panel considers that the Amendment:
supports and
achieves the objectives of the Municipal Planning Strategy and Planning Policy
is consistent
with the directions and guidance of the relevant Ministerial Directions and
Planning Practice Notes
balanced outcome that delivers net community benefit and sustainable development
as required by Clause 71.02-3.
(iii) Conclusions and recommendation
For the reasons set out in this report, the Panel
concludes that the Amendment:
is supported by,
and implements, the relevant sections of the Planning Policy Framework
is consistent
with the relevant Ministerial Directions and Practice Notes
is well founded
and strategically justified
should proceed
subject to addressing the more specific issues raised in submissions as
discussed in the following chapters.
The Panel recommends:
Adopt Wangaratta Planning Scheme Amendment C86wang as exhibited.
3 Density and extent of development
3.1 Residential subdivision
(i) The issue
issue is whether the proposed subdivision layout, lot size and density are
appropriate and provide a reasonable response to the
character of the area.
(ii) Evidence and submissions
Submissions raised concerns about the proposed
development including:
it was of a
metropolitan Melbourne scale and density
it provided for
an excessive number of lots, would impact on the amenity and larger lot
character of the area and create an isolated
island of GRZ1
the density
proposed was not necessary to meet housing targets
support a 20-minute neighbourhood or social housing or affordable outcomes
because of the distance to services and lack
of public transport and would
entrench car ownership and use
the proposed
lots were not appropriately orientated
the size of lots
was insufficient to:
appropriate areas for play or relaxation
- plant canopy
- store caravans
the density of
lots would result in traffic congestion within the subdivision and impact
emergency vehicle access
impacts from the
development and location of the medium density ‘super lots’
impacts from the
school including from playing field lighting and balls over fences
considered the impact on existing service including health and community
Several submissions suggested that the subdivision should
be redesigned to provide a high quality residential area with embedded energy
efficiency design principles (including sustainable housing, passive solar
access and achieve carbon neutrality), use of recycled
water, larger lots and
additional open space. Two submissions suggested the superlots could be better
used for community uses such
as childcare, aged care, social housing or a
community hub.
Ms Rigo considered the proposed subdivision layout was an appropriate
response to its context including the South Growth Area to the
Clarkes Lane and the Farming Zone to the south that was more closely
characterised as a rural living area. She considered
the provision of medium
density housing lots (at around 17 dwellings/hectare) would be consistent with
the emerging character of
the area and provided opportunity for
diversification.
Mr Hunter advised that there were significant issues with providing
third-pipe infrastructure for recycled water into the subdivision
including the
relatively small area that would be serviced by it.
The Proponent submitted:
the Permit land
was within the existing urban area of Wangaratta City
the size of lots
in the LDRZ reflected the need to accommodate onsite septic systems rather than
protect character
there were no
character or other built form overlays that applied to the Permit land or other
strategic work that identified any character
constraints for the land and there
was no apparent character consistency in the area
the location of
the permit land as an ‘island’ or infill area would enable it to
create its own character without adversely
affecting other
Council submitted that while the proposed lot sizes would
result in a character change from the current LDRZ, the average density
consistent with the South Growth Area.
(iii) Discussion
The subdivision proposal provides a range of lot
sizes in each of the proposed stages. The majority of lots are within the
square metre range, with nine larger lots over 700 square meters and
seven smaller lots mostly on corner locations.
The Panel acknowledges these lot sizes are in some cases slightly smaller
than the established lots in the adjoining Milnes Creek
Road area or along
Wenhams Lane and substantially smaller than the LDRZ lots to the west of One
Mile Creek or the lot sizes to the
south of Clarkes Lane. However as identified
in Chapter 2 the Permit land is effectively an infill area within the
established urban
area of Wangaratta and close to existing open space, open
space linkages, a school and major transport routes. In this context an
subdivision form should be anticipated which enables an emerging character to
develop. While the Permit land may be more than
a 20 minute walk to the
Wangaratta Central Activities Area this is not a reason to refuse the Amendment
or permit. The land remains
close (and walkable) to other facilities and
services, and like adjoining residential areas, will benefit in time from
improved public
transport services that will follow urban growth in the
The Panel is satisfied the proposed mix of lot sizes is appropriate and
provides for a diversity of housing outcomes along with the
three superlots.
The mix proposed will offer additional housing choice within Wangaratta.
The identification of superlots to provide for medium density housing is an
appropriate way to support a more integrated approach
to providing this housing
form, noting that overall yield of this area will be modest, as it is limited by
the capacity of the WWTF.
The location of the superlots are suitably positioned
near areas of open space.
The subdivision provides for lots to be setback from One Mile Creek which
provides a clear visual break between the subdivision and
adjoining LDRZ
subdivision to the west. An urban edge to the school is appropriate and
consistent with school-residential interfaces
in established residential
neighbourhoods. The proposed southern treatment of the subdivision to include
areas of open space or
internal streets provides a suitable urban-rural living
interface treatment along Clarkes Lane.
In terms of the subdivision design response to the arrangement and
orientation of lots, open space provision, landscaping or environmental
sustainability outcomes, it is not the role of the Panel nor the planning
process to provide for ideal or exemplar planning outcomes.
Rather the question
for the Panel is whether, on balance, the development appropriately responds to
the policy framework and decision
guidelines of the Planning Scheme. The Panel
is of the view it does.
In the absence of any local policy seeking specific environmentally
sustainable outcomes, third-pipe infrastructure, design or built
form outcomes
for residential subdivision, it is not appropriate to apply higher standards on
a case by case basis. The Panel is
broadly satisfied that the subdivision
response is consistent with the objectives and standards of ResCode (Clause 56),
for lot design. It follows a detailed assessment of the relevant
subdivision design provisions in the Planning Report and evidence
of Ms Rigo,
which was not disputed by Council or any other evidence.
The Panel observes that the proposed Residential Guidelines permit condition
includes guidance for fencing, building materials and
setback treatments,
location of services and stormwater reuse which will support the character of
the residential areas to the north
being reflected in future lot
development.
There are likely to be some amenity impacts on future residents from
proximity to the school from existing lighting or wayward balls
These impacts are to be expected in urban settings and are not unreasonable.
The Day 1 draft Permit includes conditions
for higher fencing along the common
boundary. Any additional future school lighting is a matter to be managed if
Overall, the subdivision layout ensures the Permit land is integrated into
the neighbourhood and existing movement and open space
networks and provides for
a suitable mix of lot sizes.
(iv) Conclusions
The Panel concludes:
subdivision layout, lot size and density are appropriate and will not have a
detrimental impact on the character of the area.
Overall, the
Amendment and draft Permit strike an appropriate balance between housing supply
yield and a transition to adjoining residential
and low density/rural living
3.2 Loss of public open space
(i) The issues
issues are whether the proposed WWTF:
would result in
an unacceptable loss of public open space
should instead
be located within the Permit land.
(ii) Background
In terms of the capacity of existing sewerage
infrastructure to support growth, Mr Hunter’s evidence identified:
There are constraints on North East Water Corporation’s (NEWC) sewerage
infrastructure, namely the lack of transfer capacity
from the urban area to the
Wangaratta North Treatment Plant. Because of the flat topography of Wangaratta,
there are several sewage
pump stations around the city, which transfer sewage to
the main transfer pump stations. This lack of capacity in the main sewers
results in the spillage from sewers during significant rainfall events. I am
advised that this lack of capacity in the network is
limiting the availability
of developable land in Wangaratta.
NEWC has implemented short and long term plans to address this problem. Long
term plans include major upgrades of pump stations, transfer
mains. Short term
plans include sewage detention tanks in some areas, to reduce localised sewage
spills. The spillages from the sewerage
system are also influenced by the
infiltration of ground water into the sewerage network through old pipes and
illegal connections
of stormwater from properties, when rainfall events occur.
The infiltration prolongs the excess flows in the sewerage network. By
sewage from the existing network during wet events, capacity is created in the
network, as less sewage is flowing to the
pump stations. NEWC advised that they
will require any solution to be able to detain sewage for 18 days to allow for
infiltration
NEWC strategic plans called for innovative servicing solutions to address the
problem in the short and long term.
He identified the proposed WWTF:
combines sewage treatment and detention of the treated water and recycling of
Class A water, to address wastewater infrastructure
capacity and facilitate
irrigation of open space for net community benefit. This solution also provides
a long term alternate water
resource to replace ground water and potable
In addition to providing sewerage services for the Clarkes Lane land, the
system also has capacity to take sewage from an adjoining
sewerage network (the
Wenhams Lane Pump Station) to add further detention during rain events and
support irrigation supply through
“sewer mining”, i.e. sewage is
taken from the sewer in wet events and treated to create capacity in the
network. (Access
to this pump station also provides additional water for
irrigation.) Having access to the Wenhams Lane system, allows additional
be released in another catchment, to support Council’s request to support
release of 100 lots in the Wangaratta South
Growth Area. The system will serve
an equivalent population of 1,225 from 350 lots.
Mr Hunter’s evidence (written, verbal and in response to
cross-examination):

footprint of the WWTF plant was less than shown on the draft Concept Plans but

confirmed that its Targoora Park storage tank would be located within the PUZ1
(iv) Discussion
Development of all components of the WWTF will
result in a reduction of public open space within Targoora Park by up to 1.9
based on Council’s closing submission advice. While this
represents only a small portion of the park it is not an insignificant
The Panel also understands that WWTF may not be a temporary solution to the
wider sewerage network challenges given its design
and secondary role to provide
Class A water for irrigation of open space and nearby school on an ongoing
There are however several factors that offset or ameliorate against this loss
of passive public open space:
the WWTF and
associated storage dam will provide the capacity to reliably and sustainably
irrigate the Targoora Park playing facilities

relying on reticulated water or the uncertainties of ongoing access to bore

accepts the advice of Mr Hunter that the proposed location of the WWTF is the
appropriate location based on access to the
existing sewer main and the areas to
receive the treated water for irrigation.
On balance the Panel considers the location of the WWTF within Targoora Park
(and therefore the basis for applying the PUZ1) is appropriate
and will have a
net positive open space result. It will be up to Council as current land owner
and NEW to work together to ensure
the final design of the WWTF creates the most
efficient footprint and minimises the visual and operational impacts on the

alternative sewerage solutions beyond that
negotiated with and supported by NEW
as the relevant servicing authority. The proposed condition providing for
rehabilitation of
the WWTF site in the event of its decommissioning remains
appropriate while NEW and Council continue to work towards a longer term
strategy that will also be important for the development of the existing growth
areas and longer term growth area. This
strategic work will be important to
provide developer and community certainty.
(v) Conclusion
The Panel concludes:
proposed location of the WWTF will not result in an unacceptable loss of open
space with the proposed development likely to provide
a net positive open space

(iii) Evidence and submissions
Submissions were concerned about the potential for
the operation of the WWTF to impact on the amenity of nearby residents and users
of the adjacent open space areas including the playing fields during sporting
events and training periods. Submissions considered
any odour even if of a low
level would be unwelcome and should not be introduced so close to homes and
public open space.
Several submissions raised concerns about odour or risk resulting from:
the potential
for system failure
In relation to odour, the evidence of Dr Shepherd was that
there was a medium risk of odour impacts for the nearest residents and
risk for the nearest recreation areas based on his Level 2 assessment under EPA

conservative analysis given the scale of the wastewater facility and its
Dr Shepherd’s evidence identified his application of EPA Publication
Separation distance guideline
, 2024 (Separation guideline) to the
WWTF (as a mechanical/biological wastewater plant) confirmed the separation
distance for the
plant was 107 metres consistent with Astute Environmental
Consulting’s 2024 Odour Assessment. The closest existing and proposed
dwellings and Cathedral College (sensitive receptors) were at or beyond this
distance. The passive open space areas (informal open
space) adjacent to the
WWTF were clearly within this distance although the use of this area would be
transient and short term, where
any odour present would be experienced
differently to those at home or in schools.
Informed by his odour observations of a recycled water plant in Sunbury that
used similar plant and processes and the proposed WWTF,
Dr Shepherd
I therefore do not expect any of the odour I observed from these processes at
the Sunbury facility to be released to the ambient air
environment at the
Proposed WWTP. Any faint residual odour emitted from the carbon filter vent
would be subject to a degree of dilution

such that odour would be unlikely to be observed in proximity to the Proposed
I understand that there will be no overflow tank and that given the low odour

In response to cross-examination and questions from the Panel, Dr Shepherd
some odour may
be experienced at 107 metres from the WWTF, but it would not be at the same
level as adjacent to the facility given

instance the main odour source was

further concerns about the Amendment and WWTF.
(iv) Discussion
The WWTF does not require a planning permit, and its
development is not therefore before the Panel. Notwithstanding this, its
is a direct consequence of the need to service the subdivision and is
a requirement of the development by way of permit conditions.
The Panel is satisfied that the WWTF, sited in the location shown in the
plans, can be developed in a way that achieves acceptable
amenity outcomes, if
designed and managed appropriately. Mr Hunter and Dr Shepherd’s evidence
shows this is the case, supported
by the EPA’s advice.
The Panel considers that the Permit application is supported by a
sufficiently rigorous odour analysis consistent with Clause 13.07-1S
Separation Guideline with two Level 2 odour assessments confirming that:
residential and
school sensitive receptors are outside the required separation distance
within adjacent informal open space areas will be low

The Panel further notes that:
the final design
and operation of the WWTF will require an EPA development licence which would
consider both odour and noise impacts
the WWTF will be
owned and operated by NEW, an authority familiar with operating such
facilities.
(v) Conclusion
The Panel concludes:
The WWTF will
not result in an unreasonable amenity impact on nearby residents and open space
uses through the production of odour
4.2 Traffic
(i) The issues
issues are whether:
the proposed
subdivision will have an acceptable impact on traffic volumes and traffic
movement on the surrounding streets
the proposed
traffic works and intersection treatments are appropriate.
(ii) Background
What is proposed?
Key traffic and transport
movement features of the proposed subdivision include:
vehicle access
intersection to Wangaratta-Whitfield Road including realignment of
Laceby-Targoora Road in the vicinity of the Wangaratta-Whitfield
intersection
- Clarkes Lane,
including new left and right turn lanes on Clarkes Lane
- the extension
of Milnes Creek Drive
an upgrade to
the Wangaratta-Whitfield Road/Site Access intersection to provide left and right
turn lanes on Wangaratta-Whitfield
allowance for
the widening of Clarkes Lane if required in the future by the provision of an
eight metre setback from Clarkes Lane
to the edge of development and
internalisation of all property access within the Permit land
a new network of
‘internal’ streets
a network of
shared paths along Clarkes Lane, One Mile Creek and between One Mile Creek and
Targoora Park.
Traffic Report
The Amendment and draft Permit application was
supported by a Traffic Report, the key findings of which included:
The design of
the proposed subdivision is generally in accordance with Clause 56 requirements
of the Wangaratta Planning Scheme and
the Infrastructure Design Manual.
The proposed
internal road network and connections to Clarkes Lane are expected to be
suitable to accommodate the proposed development
traffic generation;
configuration of Clarkes Lane has been developed in conjunction with
Council’s future plan;
The ultimate
cross section of Clarkes Lane (which will be delivered by others) has been
allowed for within the proposed subdivision
The proposed
Wangaratta-Whitfield Road intersection arrangement is considered appropriate in
accommodating the traffic generation
of the proposed development and any future
traffic growth in the future;
Up to 80 lots
can be delivered prior to the upgrade works at the Wangaratta-Whitfield Road
intersection; and
The proposed
Laceby-Targoora Road / Clarkes Lane intersection arrangement is considered
appropriate in the ultimate configuration.
Freight bypass
A key traffic issue for Council was the impact of
the proposed development on the potential of Clarkes Lane to provide for a
bypass route option as identified in its
Wangaratta Freight and Land Use Strategy,
2016. The potential for a freight route along Clarkes Lane was considered
as part of the Amendment and draft Permit, notwithstanding
that the Strategy has
no status from a planning perspective under the Planning Scheme, and that the
proposed route is one of several
Head, Transport for Victoria (DTP-Transport) was a referral authority for the
Amendment and Permit application. Prior to exhibition
of the Amendment,
DTP-Transport provided a written response advising it generally supported the
Amendment and draft Permit but raised
a number of matters for consideration:
The realignment
of Clarkes Lane through the subject site to intersect with Wangaratta-Whitfield
Road is proposed to allow for Clarkes
Lane to function as a major Council Road
in the future.
The intersection
of the realigned Clarkes Lane & Laceby-Targoora Road must be as far as
practical from Wangaratta-Whitfield Road.
Desirably access
to/from individual residential properties would be via an internal road network
rather than directly from Clarkes
Lane, especially in the vicinity of
Laceby-Targoora Road and Wangaratta-Whitfield Road.
lf, and when,
Clarkes Lane is upgraded to be the proposed southern Wangaratta Bypass, an
appropriate control for the intersection
of Wangaratta-Whitfield Road &
Laceby- Targoora Road must be to the satisfaction of and at no cost to the Head,
Transport for
The proposal to
limit bus access from the subdivision and nominate Clarks Lane is not supported.
A bus-capable north/south central
connection should be retained through the
provision of a road that meets the design criteria required for bus access (see
for land-use development | Department of Transport and Planning
(dtp.vic.gov.au). This is consistent with the policy contained in
Clause 18.01
of the Wangaratta Planning Scheme.
Included in its response were
conditions to be included in the draft Permit including:
plans to show
the realignment of Clarkes Lane to provide a direct connection to
Wangaratta-Whitfield Road
the realignment
of Laceby-Targoora Road to provide a T-intersection at Clarkes
It is unclear however why DTP-Transport’s drafting was
not exactly replicated in the exhibited draft Permit.
(iii) Evidence and submissions
Several submissions were concerned about the impact
of the Amendment and development proposal on traffic and parking. These
concerns about:
capacity and road network impacts (including the design of the reconfigured
Wangaratta-Whitfield Road intersection and the potential
for further traffic
delays at the reconfigured intersection)
intensification of school related traffic from future residents
impacts to the
existing residential area to the north of the subject site as a result of
connecting Miles Creek Drive to the development
parking impacts (including impacts to emergency vehicles access)
safety impacts
including pedestrian access along Clarkes Lane, and access for the Murray to
Mountains Rail Trail users.
In response to these issues, additional
post exhibition advice was prepared by One Mile Grid to address some of these
concerns. This
additional advice confirmed, amongst a range of matters,

DTP-Transport’s conditions (although as noted by the Panel above, the
conditions differ to those included in the DTP-Transport’
February 2024 response). It identified the Proponent had made no changes to the
proposed road layout or traffic treatments in response
to the submitter
The Proponent relied on the traffic evidence of Mr Furness in relation to
traffic matters. Mr Furness undertook a review of the traffic
work that had
been undertaken by OneMileGrid, the traffic concerns of the submitters and the
requirements of DTP-Transport advising:
a) The development traffic can be accommodated by all surrounding roads and
intersections, with all intersections expected to operate
at Level of Service A
(Excellent) in all time periods).
b) The proposed turn lanes to be provided at the Wangaratta-Whitfield Road/Site
Access Road/Laceby-Targoora Road intersection provide
an appropriate treatment
to safely and efficiently accommodate the development traffic. However, I
recommend that:
crossing point of the shared path should be revisited, to bring it closer to the
intersection where visibility is better and to
cross the median island, which
would provide a pedestrian refuge.
shared path be further offset from the road carriageway on the south side of the
intersection (minimum 1.8m separation).
FLP prepared by OMG for the Wangaratta-Whitfield Road/Site Access Road
intersection is showing CHR and AUL turn lane treatments,
which are higher
standard treatments than required by Austroads Guidelines. These upgrade
treatments have been included in the conditions
required by DTP. I do not have a
concern with implementing the higher treatment, however:
future traffic volumes are well short of the higher treatment standard under an
Austroads warrants assessment, and in this context
these works are more than
works are potentially redundant if a roundabout is constructed by Council as
part of the upgrade of Clarkes Road a bypass.
d) The reorientation of the Laceby-Targoora Road to connect to the site access
road is an acceptable outcome.
e) Laceby-Targoora Road (between Wangaratta-Whitfield Road and Clarkes Lane)
will require an upgrade to provide a 6.2m sealed pavement
to accommodate the
additional traffic (noting it is already operating beyond capacity for its
constructed cross section). This is
consistent with a Rural Collector Road cross
section in the IDM.
f) The DTP condition requiring the realignment of Clarkes Lane to connect
directly to Wangaratta-Whitfield Road is not necessary
as a result of this
development, with the nexus for these works being with Council, if Council
proceeds with upgrading Clarkes Lane
to a Bypass.
g) The location of the site access point to Clarkes Lane is acceptable, with the
detailed design of the turning lanes determined
at the post-permit stage via a
Functional Layout Plan. However, the Austroads guidelines indicate that only a
Basic Left and Right
Turn Lane treatment is warranted at this location.
h) The widening of the Clarkes Lane road reserve, provision of an off-road
shared path and prohibition of direct vehicle access from
private lots to
Clarkes Lane means that:
Lane would provide an appropriate configuration to operate as a Collector Road,
with no changes to the main carriageway.
Lane can readily be upgraded to higher order road/Freight Bypass route by
Council at a later date, as the design is not encumbered
by needing to
accommodate additional access points and direct property access.
internal roads provide cross sections that accord with the objectives of both
Clause 56.06 of the Planning Scheme and Council’s
IDM and can accommodate
the daily traffic expected within the site.
j) The Development Plans contain a variety of shared path and footpath
connections, providing a connective network that promotes
walking/cycling for
local trips.
k) Clarkes Lane provides an appropriate and efficient option for a future bus
service and all new lots are within walking distance
of this potential future
internal road network has been designed to ensure all properties can be
adequately serviced by Council waste collection and emergency
m) Having reviewed the relevant background material, I am satisfied that there
are no reasons why the proposed amendment should not
proceed, subject to
appropriate conditions.
On the 21 May 2025, during the Panel Hearing, DTP-Transport through the
Proponent provided a further response to the proposal informed
Furness’ evidence (D31). The DTP-Transport response addressed each of the
draft conditions it had previously requested
for inclusion on the planning
permit in February 2024 and advised that it supported:
The realignment
of Laceby-Targoora Road to intersect with the Proposed Access Road (future
Clarkes Lane).
The Proposed
Access Road (Future Clarkes Lane) directly intersecting with
Wangaratta-Whitfield Road.
The provision of
land within the subject site for the future realignment of Clarkes Lane (to
connect to the Proposed Access Road).
The provision of
a CHR(s) and BAL in-lieu of the originally proposed CHR and AUL turn treatments
at the Wangaratta-Whitfield Road
intersection.
(iv) Discussion
Wangaratta-Whitfield Road and Laceby Targoora Road
intersection
The most recent
DTP-Transport response in relation to this intersection clarified that it does
not require ‘
realignment of Clarkes Lane to provide a direct connection
to Wangaratta-Whitfield Road’
as part of this combined amendment and
application. It does however require is
the realignment
of Laceby-Targoora Road to intersect with the proposed subdivision’s
‘Proposed Access Road’, which
will, if the freight route is
developed, act as an extension of Clarkes Lane)
the ability to
provide for the realignment of Clarkes Lane to connect with Wangaratta-Whitfield
Road if that is required in the future.
This response appeared to be
a point of confusion with Council on the final day of the Hearing, with Council
interpreting DTP-Transport’s
advice as requiring provision of the direct
connection now. However, the Panel considers it is clear DTP-Transport’s
advice is to ensure there is adequate reservation space allowed if the
realignment of Clarkes Lane is required in the future and
not to require these
works now. The Panel’s recommended permit conditions reflects its and the
Proponent’s understanding
of DTP-Transport’s advice.
In terms of the intersection arrangement shown on the Concept Development
Plan Version 17, and assessed in Mr Furness’ evidence,
the Panel is
satisfied that the configuration of the Wangaratta-Whitfield Road and
Laceby-Targoora Road intersection as proposed
is appropriate. This includes
prioritising the new ‘Proposed Access Road’ to the subdivision over
Laceby-Targoora Road
(where normally the higher order road, being
Laceby-Targoora Road, would be prioritised).
In addition, the Panel supports the recommendations of Mr Furness in relation
to the shared path crossings at the intersection (where
he recommends minor
changes to the crossing alignments to provide a safer crossing environment) and
his recommendations in relation
to the right and left turn treatments to be
provided at that intersection. These include a ‘downgrade’ of the
originally proposed by OneMileGrid at the intersection to instead
provide a Channelised Right Turn Lane (Short) and Basic left turn
lane, changes
which DTP-Transport did not contest in its most recent referral response. The
Panel’s recommendations in this
regard are captured in the Panel
recommended Planning Permit in Appendix D.
Finally, the Panel supports the requirement for Laceby-Targoora Road to be
sealed to a width of 6.2 metres to meet current Infrastructure
Development
Manual requirements for a rural collector road, noting that it is already
operating beyond capacity for its constructed
cross-section, as raised by
submitters and Mr Furness.
Clarkes Lane (including consideration of the potential freight
bypass and access to the subdivision)
The Panel considers that appropriate allowance has
been made for the widening and upgrade of Clarkes Lane to a Collector Road, if
required in the future. This includes the provision of an eight metres setback
from the Clarkes Lane road reserve, the provision
of a shared path along the
north side of Clarkes Lane and the provision of internal accessways for the
subdivision so there is no
direct access to the Clarkes Lane other than via the
single vehicular access point located shown on the Concept Development Plan
(Version 17) and shown in Figure 8.
Clarkes Lane treatment
To reduce the electronic size of this document, Figure 8 has been removed
from this version of the report. Contact Planning Panels
Victoria to obtain a
complete copy of the report.
The Panel also supports the traffic treatment at the proposed central access
point to the subdivision from Clarkes Lane as recommended
by Mr Furness. This
involves the provision of Basic Left and Right turn lanes, where OneMileGrid
originally proposed higher standard
treatments. The Panel accepts the evidence
of Mr Furness that the higher order treatment suggested by OneMileGrid will only
be required
if Clarkes Lane is upgraded to a higher order road/freight bypass
and should not be a requirement or expectation of the proposed
subdivision to
In addition, Mr Furness’s evidence provides a discussion of what would
need to happen at the Wangaratta-Whitfield Road and Clarkes
Lane intersection if
Clarkes Lane is upgraded to function as a freight bypass. Whilst the
intersection detail of a potential future
upgrade is not a matter for this Panel
(other than considering whether there is flexibility for such an upgrade if
as discussed above) the Panel highlights Mr Furness’
observations as something the Road Authority could consider if the upgrade
occur at some point in the future.
Finally, the Panel does not consider there is any nexus between the proposed
subdivision and the need for an upgrade to the Greta
Road/Clarkes Lane
intersection given the low volumes of traffic from the proposed subdivision that
are predicted to use this intersection,
as outlined in the OneMileGrid response
to submissions. Accordingly, the Panel does not support the need for works to
that intersection
as suggested in submissions.
Impacts to surrounding local streets from the Permit
application
The Panel acknowledges the concerns of the local
community about potential impacts to the local road network, both in terms of
possibility of through traffic utilising the existing local road network as
well as the potential exacerbation of any safety issues
particularly around
Cathedral College at peak times. The concerns about access for emergency
services are also acknowledged.
The Panel firstly notes that it accepts the findings of OneMileGrid and Mr
Furness that the existing road network surrounding the
site generally has
capacity in terms of traffic volumes and surveyed intersections including at
peak hour. Multiple surveys of existing
conditions have been undertaken, and
careful consideration given to anticipated future traffic volumes and
anticipated movements
and traffic flow.
Based on this work, the Panel is satisfied that the road network can readily
accommodate the additional traffic the proposal will
generate at all times
(including at peak times for Cathedral College) without material delays to road
users, including emergency
The Panel is also satisfied that the extension of Milnes Creek Drive into the
proposed subdivision represents an acceptable traffic
outcome. Whilst this
change will result in additional traffic in Milnes Creek Drive, the Panel is
satisfied that the extent of additional
traffic is not unreasonable and sits
well within the capacity for which the road was designed. The subdivision
layout appropriately
responds to the movement network strategies of Clause
Public transport access and pedestrian/cycling
access/safety
The Panel acknowledges that, as it often the case
in regional towns, there is limited access to public transport in this part of
Wangaratta.
However, the Panel is satisfied that there is the potential for
better access to be provided via the provision of a bus route and
bus stop along
Clarkes Lane. This is not a matter that is within the control of either the
Proponent or the Council, however, the
additional population that the proposal
will generate should provide further support for the provision of public
transport services
to the area.
In relation to pedestrian and cycling access and the safety issues that have
been raised the Panel considers the proposal should assist
in alleviating some
of these issues. The Permit application includes:
a new cycling
lane along Clarkes Lane (where there is currently no dedicated pedestrian or
cycling access) and along One Mile Creek
a shared path
crossing at the intersection of Wangaratta-Whitfield and Laceby-Targoora roads
designed to utilise the proposed median
and provide a safer crossing environment
for pedestrians and cyclists.
Accordingly, the Panel is satisfied
that the proposal will not result in an unsafe environment for pedestrians or
cyclists and that
the subdivision design appropriately responds to the movement
network strategies of Clause 18.02.
Street layout and accessibility of the proposed
subdivision
Mr Furness undertook an assessment of the proposal
against the relevant requirements of Clause 56 of the Planning Scheme as well as
the requirements of the Infrastructure Design Manual. He confirmed that the
proposal satisfied the objectives of both provisions
and will result in an
appropriate road layout that can accommodate the predicted daily traffic
(including on-street parking) within
the site and the access and turning
movements of emergency vehicles and garbage trucks.
The proposed street layout and accessibility of the subdivision is considered
acceptable.
(v) Conclusions
The Panel concludes:
The proposal
will not result in unacceptable impacts on traffic volumes and traffic movement
on the surrounding streets.
The traffic
works and intersection treatments that are proposed are appropriate, subject to
the inclusion of appropriate permit conditions
changes consistent with the
Panel’s recommended planning permit in Appendix D.

(ii) Background
The Amendment and draft

with the remaining
patches representative of
EVC55: Plains Grassy Woodland
. The patches are
of moderate quality and located as follows:

The Biodiversity Assessment noted that habitats for native wildlife were
generally highly modified, aside from the areas of remnant
vegetation. While
the open exotic grasslands provided limited fauna habitat, they did provide
foraging habitat for a range of birds.
Higher quality habitats included the
areas of remnant vegetation that supported mature trees, which were generally
located within
the south-eastern portion of the study area, One Mile Creek, and
as scattered trees including within the road reserves.
Fifteen fauna species were recorded within the study area including species
such as Striated Pardalote and the Red-rumped Parrot
One Mile Creek
formed a contiguous habitat corridor, which extends beyond the study area which
provided opportunities for fauna to
move across the landscape. Fish and frog
species were likely to utilise the aquatic habitats located along One Mile
Creek, although
none were recorded during the assessment. Potential fauna
impacts in relation to One Mile Creek are discussed further in Chapter
(iii) Evidence and submissions
Several submissions raised concerns about the
impacts to biodiversity on the site including loss of native vegetation and
to a range of species including within One Mile Creek.
DEECA provided a written response to the proposal in relation to biodiversity
matters on 14 May 2024 which identified that:
DEECA has assessed the application (in its current form), the proposed
development doesn’t appear to have significant impact
on the biodiversity
values and efforts have been made to design a development sympathetic to the
natural values.
DEECA supports the planning permit application and the “draft”
planning permit conditions with the inclusion of the recommendations
in the Biodiversity Assessment, Clarkes Lane, Wangaratta
(Ecolink February
including those that seek to protect and enhance existing natural
values in the development area and the adjoining One Mile Creek
Wenham’s Lane Reserve and permit conditions provided below.
Included in DEECA’s submission were also a number of conditions which
it requested to have included on any planning permit.
Council advised that
subsequent to DEECA’s initial advice it was provided with the updated
Biodiversity Assessment and Arborist
Report. As a result, DEECA provided
updated permit conditions which Council included in its Day 1 version of the
draft Permit.
In relation to flora and fauna matters the Proponent advised:
The Site is predominantly cleared grazing land, with small patches of native
vegetation and native scattered trees. As a starting
point, this provides an
opportunity for building homes without causing significant ecological impacts.
Notwithstanding, consistent
with the avoid-minimise principles in the Planning
Scheme, the subdivision design and WWTP siting have been laid out to avoid
vegetation removal so far as practicable. For instance, reserves have
been located in areas containing clusters of native vegetation,
setback has been provided to One Mile Creek, avoiding impacts to this
environment entirely. Similarly, the WWTP has been
sited to avoid any native
vegetation removal. In the circumstances, the Proposal has very low ecological
impact and has acceptably
responded to the avoid-minimise requirements of the
Planning Scheme. Permit conditions as drafted by DEECA and Council will ensure
appropriate tree protection measures, weed control, fauna management and offsets
are secured during development.
(iv) Discussion
The Panel considers that the requirements of the
Planning Scheme at Clause 52.17 to ‘avoid, minimise and offset’ have
been appropriately addressed through the proposed development response. The
Permit land is highly modified with only limited native
vegetation currently
present. The subdivision layout has been designed to retain trees and native
vegetation where possible in open
space reserves.
In addition, the Concept Development Plan Version 17 includes building
exclusion zones and tree protection zones to further ensure
that those trees or
areas of native vegetation to be retained as are protected when development of
the site occurs. It is also noted
that the WWTF has been sited to ensure that
no native vegetation removal is required.
Having considered the Biodiversity and Arborist Reports, the advice of DEECA,
the policy provisions of Clause 12.01 and decision making
guidelines of Clause
52.17, the Panel is satisfied that the proposed development will not result in
unacceptable impacts to biodiversity,
subject to appropriate conditions to
manage native vegetation impacts and impacts on fauna impacted by tree removal.
This includes
the Day 1 proposed:
DEECA conditions
including for offsets
proposed conditions for wildlife protection associated with any tree
proposed Construction and Environmental Management Plan conditions and other
related conditions providing for tree
protection zones
amended plans
condition to identify a wildlife corridor as identified in the updated
Biodiversity Report and associated condition
for a detailed landscaping plan
providing for supplementary planting of this area.
Potential impacts
on the environmental values of One Mile Creek are discussed below.
(v) Conclusion
The Panel concludes:
The development
proposal will not result in unacceptable impacts to biodiversity subject to the
inclusion of appropriate permit conditions
including DEECA’s proposed
conditions.

treated water from the WWTF to be discharged to One Mile Creek, during
Targoora Park WWTP Recycled Water Discharge – Environmental
Risk Assessment report
was subsequently prepared by Water Technology in May
2025 to consider the proposed discharge of excess recycled water (Class A) into
One Mile Creek. The Environmental Risk Assessment was prepared to support the
WWTF proposal in accordance with EPA Guideline 1287
and was included as an
Appendix to Mr McAlister’s evidence statement.
The Environmental Risk Assessment includes a biodiversity assessment of fauna
in One Mile Creek and identifies six species as having
a high likelihood of
inhabiting One Mile Creek. These species comprise the Common Froglet, Plains
Froglet, Sloane’s froglet,
Southern Bell Frog, Rakali (Australian Water
Rat) and Platypus. The Environmental Risk Assessment identified a medium level
to local frog species (including under existing conditions without any
discharge from the project) and seasonal medium risk during
autumn and winter.
To manage any potential impacts a 5 year monitoring program was recommended,
along with investigation of species-specific
toxicity thresholds and discharge
suspension protocols.
Stormwater Run-off
The stormwater management of the Permit land has
been designed to provide for all stormwater to flow to a proposed bioretention
in the western portion of the site, abutting One Mile Creek. From the
bioretention basin the stormwater will then be released into
One Mile Creek via
a single discharge point.
The exhibited Stormwater Management Strategy outlines the specific site
requirements for the stormwater quantity management through
the site, covering
runoff volumes generated, permissible site discharge and the on-site detention
requirements.
(iii) Evidence and submissions
The potential impacts to One Mile Creek from the
discharge of Class A treated water or the flow of stormwater from the
bioretention
basin, was raised in several submissions. A key concern was the
potential for these flows to impact creek fauna, particularly the
One submitter also raised concerns in relation to erosion impacts to One Mile
Creek. The submitter highlighted that the section of
One Mile Creek abutting
the site is upstream of Wangaratta where it flows through the town and into the
Three Mile Creek. The submission
noted that there was a risk of sediment
running into the waterways during construction, and from the subdivision on an
ongoing basis
which could exacerbate the existing environmental conditions of
Other submissions identified potential concerns from flooding on any
infrastructure constructed within flood prone areas, safety around
bioretention basin or pedestrian access to the creek (on private property).
Council’s Part B submission responded to these concerns as follows:
...a Stormwater
Management Plan was exhibited with the amendment deals with quality and
quantity. Exhibited draft permit conditions
also deal with legal point of
discharge to ensure flood impacts minimise flood risk.
exhibition period NECMA made a submission to the amendment. NECMA has
responsibilities relating to floodplain management
and the special water supply
catchment. NECMA submitted conditions to be added to the exhibited draft permit
to address floodplain
management.
Officers have
made updates in response to NECMAs submission. The relevant permit conditions
are contained in the Day 1 Document –
Draft Permit Conditions at paragraph
81 and permit notes.
exhibited Biodiversity Report refers to isolated records of platypus sighting
and the One Mile Creek may provide habitat for
such species.
Proponent also provided a response to the concerns raised, submitting:
First, the Proposal does not include works on One Mile Creek, other than the
outfall from the detention basin which is a very minor
work, so will not have
direct impacts on the Creek.
Second, it is observed that residential lots abut One Mile Creek for several
kilometres as it passes through urban Wangaratta, which
is an expected and
common condition where waterways traverse urban areas.
Third, the future residential use of the Land can be expected to have neutral
if not lesser impacts than the current grazing use.
This is because the proposed
onsite stormwater detention and treatment systems will treat water quality to
best practice standards.
This can be contrasted with agricultural use which has
no such control and is often a source of sediment and nitrogen loads on
Concerns about the ecological health of the creek were also addressed by Mr
McAlister’s evidence who confirmed:
stormwater from the proposal will go the bio-retention basin and will be
released to One Mile Creek at a controlled rate,
to ensure no impact to
downstream flooding
the use of the
bio-retention basin was a best practice “
tried and tested
there will be no
unacceptable water quality or environmental impacts associated with the
potential release of water from the WWTF,
as any water discharged would be
dechlorinated and require EPA approval
there will be no
adverse impacts on the water quality or ecological health of One Mile Creek
notwithstanding the above, once the proposal has started and operation the
operation of the WWTF commenced, a data collection
program should be undertaken
to confirm there are no adverse impacts.
When asked under
cross-examination about potential impacts to the platypus from the release of
Class A water from the WWTF, Mr McAlister
stated that having reviewed the
proposal from a water quality perspective, and noting that he is an engineer
rather than an ecologist,
he expected there would be ‘none
whatsoever’.
(iv) Discussion
As identified earlier in this report the WWTF does
not require planning approval. While the Permit can and does have conditions
to its provision by stage 1 it cannot include specific conditions
Mile Creek. This is a matter of further detailed design approval by NEW and the
EPA under other legislation. The Panel
anticipates that any EPA approval would
likely include a requirement for data collection and monitoring as recommended
by Mr McAlister.
Broader issues relating to impacts on One Mile Creek directly relating to the
proposed subdivision (including habitat impacts, flooding
and erosion) are
however relevant considerations.
The Panel understands the concerns of the local community in relation to the
potential for impacts to One Mile Creek and any fauna
in the creek. The Panel
notes that both the Biodiversity Assessment and the Environmental Risk
Assessment report identified the
potential for there to be fauna in the Creek,
although only the Environmental Risk Assessment recorded the presence of any
Notwithstanding the above, the Panel is persuaded by the evidence of Mr
McAlister and considers that the proposed subdivision development
result in unacceptable impacts to the creek and its role as potential habitat
for the platypus and other fauna. In coming
to this conclusion, the Panel
highlights that:
the existing
creek environment as it extends through Wangaratta is urban in nature, thus the
environment that will be created here
is not an unusual circumstance however
managing the interface to the creek during and post construction will be
run-off from the proposed development is expected to represent an improvement to
what occurs currently in terms of the
quality of the water that is released.
This is due to the use of the bio-retention basin and the implementation of best
techniques - as compared to the existing conditions of the site where
there is no treatment of water before it flows into the creek
the two referral
authorities with a particular interest in stormwater quality and management
– MGW and NECMA, advised they did
not object to the development and their
nominated conditions have been included in the Day 1 version.
relation to the erosion concerns that were raised, the Panel does not expect
that the proposal will result in a worsening of conditions
along the creek line
– noting that the subject site does not include the creek itself.
The exhibited Landscape Master Plan shows an open space reserve, bike path
and landscaping on the land abutting the creek corridor.
The Panel expects that
landscaping of this area may well assist in improving the ecological conditions
of the creek, as will the
improved quality of the stormwater discussed
The Panel is satisfied the draft Permit conditions provide for drainage areas
to be constructed in such a way to ensure public safety
whether that be through
batter angles or fencing.
The Panel notes the advice of Council that there are no lots proposed within
the existing LSIO and any paths and other infrastructure
within the LSIO can be
appropriately designed to minimise damage or impede flood water.
Further, any potential impacts from construction are able to be managed by a
Construction Environmental Management Plan condition
requirement as proposed in
the exhibited draft Permit. The Day 1 version of draft Permit includes a number
of conditions that will
assist in managing impacts on One Mile Creek from
stormwater or erosion including:
Residential
Design Guidelines providing for stormwater re-use
Detailed landscaping plans to provide for native vegetation restoration and
additional plantings along the creek reserve
conditions for
on-site detention and water sensitive urban design
amending the
Construction and Environmental Management Plan condition to include specific
measure for works adjacent to the creek.
However, the landscaping
conditions should be amended to provide for fencing treatments along the creek
edge property boundary to
restrict pedestrian access to the creek to minimise
erosion) and to delineate private property.
With the inclusion of these updated conditions the Panel does not expect the
proposal to result in further erosion of One Mile Creek
or detrimental impacts
to water quality consistent with the policy considerations of Clause 12.03.
(v) Conclusion
The Panel concludes:
The proposed
subdivision development will not result in unacceptable impacts to the water
quality of One Mile Creek or habitat values
of the creek from stormwater or
erosion subject to the inclusion of appropriate conditions on the draft Permit
to manage potential
4.5 Provision of open space
(i) The issue
issue is whether the location and extent of open space provided as part of the
proposed subdivision is appropriate.
(ii) Background
The open space areas as shown on Concept
Development Plan Version 17 comprise:
a linear open
space reserve of 5,247 square metre, which also incorporates a shared path,
along the north side of the subdivision,
connecting Targoora Park to One Mile
a second linear
reserve of 4,292 square metres, along One Mile Creek, also with a shared path,
that extends along the western boundary
of the site, incorporates the
bio-retention basin and connects to Clarkes Lane to the south
an open space
reserve abutting Clarkes Lane of 3,372 square metres that also abuts one of the
three medium density housing superlots
an open space
reserve of 1.172 hectares in the south east corner of the site, which will be
truncated if Clarkes Lane is upgraded
to be used as a freight route.
(iii) Evidence and submissions
There were a number of submissions concerned about
the open space provision. Submitters noted its importance from both a mental
and environmental perspective and highlighted that there was no provision
of a playground area or place for informal recreation to
play ball sports.
Council responded to these concerns in its Part B submission and highlighted
that the required amount of open space is provided (from
a Planning Scheme
perspective) noting that the open space is provided as open space links rather
than traditional playground type
space. Council also noted that the Proponent
had advised that the proposal would continue to exceed the open space
requirements
even if open space is lost in the future as a result of the
re-alignment of Clarkes Lane.
In relation to open space Ms Rigo considered that:
2.46 hectares of unencumbered open space (equivalent to 10% of the total site
area, excluding flood prone land) is proposed to be
provided, with proposed open
space areas linked to existing public open space reserves and integrated with
encumbered land (One Mile
Creek reserve) that is accessible for public
recreation (Clause 56.05-2 / Standard C13).
(iv) Discussion
The proposed open space provision on the Permit
land has considered several factors:
linkages to
existing open space areas and bicycle/pedestrian paths
retention of
indigenous trees in open space reserves
co-location of
open space reserves with the medium density housing superlots
the presence of
significant regional level open space in proximity to the site in the form of
Targoora Park and its baseball and softball
sports facilities, along with the
additional dog off-leash area and the Wenhams Reserve interface.
proposed location and extent of open space represents an acceptable planning
outcome and is consistent with the requirements of
Clause 53.10, the urban
landscape standards and policy objectives and strategies of Clause 19.02. The
proposed open space linkages
along the western and northern sides of the
subdivision, and the connections that are provided both to Targoora Park to the
and Clarkes Lane to the south will result in an accessible and permeable
open space network.
In terms of the open space areas located in the south east of the site, while
they are not centrally located on the site, their locations
are broadly
appropriate given the presence of existing trees to be retained as well as the
accessibility of the northern portion
of the site to Targoora Park and Wenhams
However, the Panel considers improved surveillance is required in relation
the open space reserve located in the south east of the
site, abutting the
medium density housing superlot 172. With this in mind, the Panel supports the
proposed condition put forward
by the Proponent requiring the Residential
Guidelines for the subdivision to include:
Principles to promote passive surveillance from a future development of lot
172 (future medium density housing) to the public open
space south of lot 172,
including through measures relating to outlook from dwellings, fence height and
permeability.
In relation to access to active open space areas and sporting facilities, the
Panel is satisfied that with the proximity of the site
to Targoora Park, and the
access that is provided by the linear open space and shared paths shown on
Concept Development Plan Version
17, that there is no need for additional active
open spaces to be provided beyond those shown. It is also considered acceptable
that there are no areas of active open space proposed as part of the subdivision
given the presence of extensive sporting facilities
at Targoora Park, and the
connections provided to the park via the shared path network.
In relation to submitter concerns regarding the lack of a playground area or
play equipment, the Panel notes that the draft planning
permit that was
exhibited as part of the Amendment included a condition requiring the landscape
master plan to include the ‘
detailed design and the exact location of
the playground to be provided in Stage 1 – South East reserve
paths, paved areas, playgrounds, play items, structures, and
street furniture
(v) Conclusion
The Panel concludes:
The location and
extent of open space proposed as part of the proposed subdivision development is
appropriate.

(iii) Discussion
Policy considerations
The Panel is satisfied
that the proposed subdivision development is consistent with the relevant
policies of the Municipal Planning
Strategy and Planning Policy Framework.
As discussed in Chapter 3 the proposed subdivision layout, lot size and
density are appropriate for the Permit land, taking into account
both the policy
context of the Planning Scheme and the locational and physical attributes of the
site and its surrounds. The Panel
also considers that the proposed provision of
public open space and the new shared paths proposed as part of the subdivision
provide appropriate interfaces and connections to existing surrounding
development.
As discussed in Chapter 4, the Panel is satisfied that potential impacts on
the environment (including existing vegetation and potential
impacts to the
habitat of One Mile Creek) have been appropriately considered as part of the
planning permit application, as has potential
traffic impacts. These impacts
can all be managed through proposed or further amended conditions on the
During the Hearing there was further discussion about the approaches to:
the Cultural
Heritage Management Plan (CHMP) approved under the
Aboriginal Heritage Act
based on changes to the concept plans forming part of it consistent
with the considerations of Clause 15.03-2S
bushfire threat consistent with Clause 13.02-1S.
Cultural Heritage Management Plan
Planning Practice Note 45: The
Heritage Act 2006
and the Planning Permit Process
(PPN45) identifies the
Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006
requires permit applicants to prepare a CHMP
if all or part of the activity is a listed high impact activity, resulting in
significant
ground disturbance, and if all or part of the activity area is an
area of cultural heritage sensitivity, which has not been subject
to significant
ground disturbance. Where required (as it is here) the responsible authority
cannot issue a planning permit until
it receives a copy of the approved CHMP
section 52(1)
Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006
The Panel asked questions of the Proponent about whether the approved CHMP
appropriately reflected either version 15 or 17 of the
Concept Development Plan
Version 17, and whether this was of consequence.
The Proponent noted that the current proposed layout of the northern portion
of the site, comprising the area of the WWTP, was not
reflected in the
‘activity area’ included in the CHMP, but highlighted that the
residential subdivision area did ‘match’
that shown in the CHMP. The
Proponent also advised that if the subdivision and WWTP were considered as two
different projects then
the WWTP would not actually have required a CHMP as it
was not within an area of cultural heritage sensitivity (determined by proximity
to the One Mile Creek).
The CHMP identified there were no Aboriginal cultural heritage places or
material identified within the Permit land activity area.
The Panel is of the view that the CHMP clearly identifies the Permit land and
proposed subdivision layout within the activity area
map and does not need to be
amended prior to the issue of the Permit. However, whether the CHMP needs to be
amended prior to the
development of the WWTF is a matter for further
investigation by Council and the Proponent.
A condition regarding compliance with the CHMP is not required as a condition
of permit as it repeats a requirement of other legislation.
It was deleted in
the Day 1 version.
The exhibited amendment was referred to the CFA however no response was
received. After further follow up from Council, the CFA advised
that FRV was
the appropriate authority.
As no submission was received from the FRV prior to or during the Panel
Hearing, consideration was given to the recommendations included
exhibited Bushfire Report. Council and the Proponent were directed by the Panel
to consider whether any recommendations of
that report needed to be implemented
via conditions of the planning permit and, if so, to prepare draft
conditions.
The Final Day version of the permit was subsequently amended to include a
number of conditions addressing the recommendations of the
Bushfire Report in
addition to Clause 56 provisions for fire hydrants.
The Panel advised it would receive further correspondence from the FRV during
or shortly after the conclusion of the Hearing, noting
Council was also able to
add any late FRV advice before considering approval of the Amendment and draft
FRV on 10 June 2025 advised Council (who had provided it with Council’s
Final Day version of the draft Permit) that it had read
the Bushfire Report and
identified:
The water supply, hydrant and roads conditions contained within the Bushfire
Planning Report (once endorsed as part of the Permit)
would satisfy FRV
conditions...
Consideration of Planning Scheme provisions
Table 8 summarises the Panel’s consideration
of the draft Permit against the relevant zone and overlay provisions and
provisions of the Planning Scheme.
As noted elsewhere in this Report while the WWTF is required to service the
proposed subdivision, and its provision is appropriately
required as a condition
of the draft Permit it does not require a planning permit and has not been
assessed by the Panel.
Zone, overlay
and particular provisions planning permit considerations
Panel position
Refer Chapter 3 and 4.1. The proposed pattern of subdivision is consistent
with the purpose of the zone and the ‘General’
‘Subdivision’ decision guidelines and the objectives and standards
of Clause 56.
Refer Chapter 4.4. The permit application has appropriately considered the
potential flood impacts from One Mile Creek with all residential
lots outside
the LSIO. The Day 1 version of the draft Permit includes the conditions of the
floodplain management authority. The
draft permit (as amended) is consistent
with the clause decision guidelines.
Clause 52.17
Refer Chapter 4.3. The assessment of native vegetation impacts have been
appropriately assessed consistent with the decision guidelines,
Vegetation Guidelines and consistent with the position of DEECA and identified
conditions including for vegetation offsets
in the Day 1 version of the draft
Permit. The draft permit (as amended) is consistent with the clause decision
guidelines.
Clause 52.02
The permit application has appropriately sought the views of AusNet as the
affected party to remove the easement (E-1) with AusNet’s
included on the Day 1 version of the draft Permit in relation to the location of
electricity supply assets. The draft
permit (as amended) is consistent with the
clause decision guidelines.
Clause 52.29
Refer Chapter 4.2. The permit application has appropriately sought the
views of DTP-Transport and included their conditions (amended
consistent with their further written advice) in the Day 1 version of the draft
Permit. These conditions subject to minor
changes are supported.
Clause 53.01
Refer Chapter 4.5. The proposed subdivision provides more than the 5 per
cent contribution required in the clause Schedule.
Clause 53.03
The Day 1 draft Permit includes a condition prohibiting reticulated gas
connections to residential lots.
Clause 53.18
Refer Chapter 4.5. The Day 1 draft Permit contains conditions relating to
stormwater detention and Assessment required against stormwater
management and
objectives with identified objectives to be met and standards which should be
The draft Permit application was supported by a detailed analysis of the
objectives, requirements and standards of Clause 56 (contained
in the Planning
Report) and confirmed in Ms Rigo’s evidence statement. The Panel is
satisfied that the subdivision layout (subject
to amendments to draft Day 1
Permit conditions) achieves the objectives and standards including:
- the size of
lots and identification of medium density lots
orientation
- providing
connectivity to existing pedestrian and open space and street networks and
future bus routes
- appropriately
integrating into the surrounding environment including One Mile Creek and the
rural residential character south of
Clarkes Lane
- stormwater
management during construction
The mandatory conditions for subdivision permits have been included in the
Day 1 version of the draft Permit in addition to the conditions
of DEECA, NECMA,
NEW, GMW and AusNet.
On balance, the Panel considers that the draft Permit application is an
appropriate response to the site’s setting and residential
context and
provides for an innovative response to a significant infrastructure constraint.
The subdivision layout is consistent
with the orderly and proper planning of the
area and will result in a net community benefit. A permit should be granted
to further changes to conditions as discussed below.
Final Day versions of the draft Permit
As discussion in Chapter 1.3, Council’s Day 1
version of the draft Permit made numerous changes to the exhibited version
the addition of the referral authority conditions.
Council and the Proponent provided Final Day changes to Council’s Day 1
version of the draft Permit. The changes proposed by
Council and the Proponent
are summarised in Table 9 which includes a summary of the Panel’s
position. Minor drafting corrections
are not identified. Changes that have
been supported by the Panel have been included in its recommended version in

(iv) Conclusion and recommendation
The Panel concludes:
a permit should be granted subject to further changes to conditions to broadly

C:1 Victorian
planning objectives
Council and the Proponent submitted that
the Amendment supported and implemented the objectives of planning in Victoria
section 4 of the PE Act as follows:
To provide for
the fair, orderly, economic and sustainable use and development of land, by:
Allowing for the
residential development of land within the existing urban boundary of Wangaratta
Regional City in response to forecast
population growth.
Facilitating the
development of new housing land which has been identified as a location for
residential development and housing growth
in the Wangaratta Housing and
Population Strategy (2013) and the Hume Regional Growth Plan (2014).
Preventing the
underdevelopment of land which is capable of providing for higher density
To provide for
the protection of natural and man-made resources and the maintenance of
ecological processes and genetic diversity
Facilitating the
efficient and appropriate use of established urban land, thereby reducing
pressure on land outside Wangaratta Regional
City urban area.
To secure a
pleasant, efficient and safe working, living and recreational environment for
all Victorians and visitors to Victoria
Ensuring the
scale, form and quantity of residential development responds appropriately to
the surrounding context of Wangaratta and
optimises access to existing jobs,
services, schools and public transport infrastructure.
Facilitating the
development of a secure and provide a pleasant, amenable, and safe living
environment.
public utilities and other assets and enable the orderly provision and
coordination of public utilities and other facilities
for the benefit of the
community, by:
Applying the
Public Use Zone to land that will be developed for a wastewater treatment plant
and associated assess ways and recycled
water storage.
Facilitating the
development of the land in a coordinated manner in accordance with a services

planning strategies
Population and Housing Strategy
Council’s adopted
Wangaratta Population and Housing Strategy 2013 (2013 Housing Strategy) includes
as its purposes to:
different types of population and housing growth to be planned for the Rural
consistency with the current and future regional direction/s for residential
land and housing.
Examine existing
and future regional and local conditions (physical, environmental and social)
that may affect the delivery of residential
land and housing in the Rural
Establish a
charter to guide housing sustainability initiatives within the Rural City.
Identify key
information gaps that will affect local planning for residential land and
housing directions and delivery of infrastructure.
Develop short,
medium and long term priorities for residential land and housing.
delivery priorities and actions to initiate those priorities.
2013 Housing Strategy sets out low, medium and high population growth scenarios.
The high growth scenario forecasts a population
of 29,840 in 2021.
Council and the Proponent submitted the Amendment is consistent with the 2013
Housing Strategy which identifies:
the subject land
as a location for “
residential subdivision and development of
undeveloped residential zoned land in the southern growth corridor
(refer Figure 10)
housing density
targets of 10 dwellings per net developable hectare
opportunities
for planning controls to guide the layout/form and delivery of greenfield
housing and combat housing affordability through
a provision of housing
Wangaratta Population and Housing Strategy
Wangaratta Population and Housing Strategy – Section of Wangaratta City
Strategic Framework Plan
Low Density and Rural Residential Strategy
Wangaratta Low Density and Rural Residential Strategy
(2020) has been
prepared by Council to:
identify the
future need for low density and rural living zoned land
strategy to meet the identified needs need and provide a diverse range of
housing options.
The draft Strategy recommends land on the southern
side of Clarkes Road (opposite the subject land) to be rezoned to the Low
Residential Zone and Rural Residential Zone. Council adopted the
Strategy on 14 December 2021, except for the elements relating
to Wangaratta
pending further strategic work. Council has subsequently adopted the
Density and Rural Residential Strategy (Wangaratta) Draft Additional
Investigations Report Oct 2023
, which identifies the land to the immediate
south of the subject land on the south side of Clarks Road as forming part of
the ‘Wangaratta
W-1C (South) Precinct’ for further consideration for
rezoning to LDRZ and RLZ, subject to the preparation of a Precinct Plan.
and overlays
A common zone and overlay purpose is to implement
the Municipal Planning Strategy and the Planning Policy Framework.
includes the relevant zone and overlay
provisions (as summarised from the Practitioner’s Guide).
Zone purpose and application
General Residential Zone (GRZ)
This zone is applied to areas where housing development of three storeys
exists or is planned for in locations offering good access
to services and
A mandatory maximum building height of 11 metres and three storeys applies
to a dwelling or residential building. A schedule to the
zone can be used
permit requirement for a dwelling (based on lot size)
specify a higher
mandatory maximum building height
requirements for specified clause 54 and clause 55 standards.
does not include additional design objectives or variations to clause 54 and
clause 55 requirements or set maximum building height
requirements.
Low Density Residential Zone (LDRZ)
This zone is applied to areas on the fringe of urban settlements and
townships with reticulated sewerage (0.2 ha minimum) or without
reticulated
sewerage (0.4 ha minimum) to ensure lots remain large enough to treat and retain
all wastewater but are small enough
to be maintained without the need for
agricultural techniques or equipment.
LDRZ1 applies 1 hectare minimum lot size for land not connected to
reticulated sewerage.
Public Use Zone (PUZ)
This zone recognises the use of land for a public purpose and prescribes a
number of categories of public use which can be shown on
the planning scheme
map. This is the main zone for public land used for utility or community service
provision. A schedule allows
specified uses or managers of public land to be
exempted from specified requirements. Alternative sign categories may be
if required.
Public Park and Recreation Zone (PPRZ)
This is the main zone for public open space and public recreation areas. A
schedule allows specified uses or managers of public land
to be exempted from
specified requirements. It also allows an exemption for buildings and works
specified in an incorporated plan.
Transport 2 Zone (TZ2)
This zone identifies land in the transport system. State-managed transport
infrastructure is designated Transport Zone 1. A road declared
Management Act 2004
is designated Transport Zone 2 and significant municipal
roads are designated Transport Zone 3. Other transport infrastructure is
designated Transport Zone 4.
Design and Development Overlay (DDO)
This overlay is principally intended to implement requirements based on a
demonstrated need to control built form and the built environment.
The intended
built form outcome, and the way in which the imposed requirements will bring
this about, must be clearly stated. where
possible, performance-based
requirements should be used rather than prescriptive requirements.
DDO6 applies to the Wangaratta aerodrome Obstacle Height Areas 1, 2 and 3
and seeks to protect the Airport’s approaches and
avoid aircraft flight
hazards by ensuring buildings and works are not within specified height limits.
The subject land is located
within Obstacle Height Area 3. A Permit is required
under DDO6 for a building that exceeds 196 metres Australian Height Datum in
Obstacle Height Area 3. No permit is triggered by under DDO6 by the Planning
Permit application.
Land Subject to Inundation Overlay (LSIO)
This overlay applies to either rural or urban land in riverine areas that
are subject to inundation but are not part of the primary
floodway. The overlay
is also applied to areas subject to coastal flooding, including areas where the
flood risk will increase as
a result of climate change. The identification of
these areas should be established in consultation with the relevant floodplain
management authority.
The LSIO applies to a small section of the site along the western lot
boundary, adjoining One Mile Creek. A Permit is required for
buildings and
works and to subdivide land affected by the LSIO. No residential lots are
proposed within the LSIO.
C:4 Ministerial
Directions and Planning Practice Notes
Ministerial Directions
The Explanatory Report discusses how the Amendment
meets the relevant requirements of Ministerial Direction 11 (Strategic
of Amendments) and
Planning Practice Note 46: Strategic Assessment
, August 2018 (PPN46). That discussion is not repeated here.
Council and the Proponent submitted that the Amendment has been assessed
against the requirements of
Ministerial Direction 1: Potentially Contaminated
. Given that the current and previous use of land the land has been
limited to pasture for the grazing of livestock, the land has
not been subject
to contaminating activities that would lead the subject land to be potentially
contaminated under Planning Practice
Note 30 (Potentially Contaminated Land).
Therefor the Amendment was considered to comply with the relevant requirements
of Ministerial
Direction 1.
The Amendment was referred to the EPA prior to the authorisation of the
Amendment in accordance with
Ministerial Direction No 19: Environmental
Protection Authority
. In response to comments received from the EPA the
Amendment documentation was revised to include an assessment against Ministerial
Direction 1 and NEW provided written confirmation that it would be the owner and
operator of the WWTF.
Planning Practice Notes
Planning Practice Note 90: Planning for housing
Planning Practice Note 90 provides guidance on “
how to plan for
housing growth and protect neighbourhood character to ensure a balanced approach
to managing residential development
in planning schemes
.” It sets out
the recommended approach to identifying minimal, incremental, and substantial
housing change areas. Council
identified that the area was a substantial change
area based on its proximity to jobs, services, schools and public open space;
has the scale to provide a diversity of housing types and result in a new
built form and neighbourhood character.
Planning Practice Note 91: Using the residential zones
Planning Practice Note 91 provides guidance on the use of the residential
zones to implement strategic work with the residential zones
and make use of the
key features of the residential zones. The General Residential Zone is to be
applied to areas where housing
development of three storeys exists or is planned
for in locations offering good access to services and transport and for areas
for incremental and substantial housing change areas. The
application of the Neighbourhood Residential Zone to substantial change
not supported in the Practice Note.
C:5 Planning
Native Vegetation Guidelines
The guidelines for the removal, destruction or
lopping of native vegetation are incorporated into the Victorian Planning
and all planning schemes in Victoria.
The guidelines set out, and describe the application of Victoria’s
statewide policy in relation to assessing and compensating
for the removal of
native vegetation. This includes:
the assessment
of impacts from removing native vegetation on biodiversity and other values
how offsets are
calculated an established to compensate for the loss in biodiversity value from
the removal of native vegetation.
To ensure that there is no net
loss to biodiversity as a result of the removal, destruction or lopping of
native vegetation. This
is achieved through the following three-step approach,
in accordance with the Guidelines:
removal, destruction or lopping of native vegetation.
Minimise impacts
from the removal, destruction or lopping of native vegetation that cannot be
offset to compensate for the biodiversity impact from the removal, destruction
or lopping of native vegetation.
Separation Distance Guideline (EPA 1949)
This guideline provides advice on recommended
separation distances between industrial land uses that emit odour and/or dust,
and sensitive
Separating incompatible land uses is important. It protects the community
from industries and activities that pose health, safety
and amenity risks. It
also protects industries from incompatible land use and development. Separation
distances are often used
as a planning tool to manage and mitigate these risks
by keeping conflicting land uses apart.
The purpose of this guideline is to support land use and development
decisions that:
protect the
community from human health and amenity risks associated with unintended offsite
odour and dust generated by industry/activity
industry/activities from inappropriate land use and development nearby that may
constrain its operations.
The decision-making process for
considering a separation distance between an odour or dust emitter and sensitive
land use is categorised
into 3 stages. The guidelines contain a flow chart
which describes the decision making process for Stages 1 (Does a recommended
separation distance apply?) and 2 (Is the recommended separation distance
The guidelines states that if a proponent wishes to seek a variation of a
recommended separation distance for odour from a decision
maker a risk
assessment should be completed. This entails the proponent:
providing a risk
assessment that details the factors and risks associated with the odour
proposing an
alternative separation distance based on the findings of the risk
demonstrating
the proposed separation distance poses a low risk of odour impact.
Practitioner’s Guide
A Practitioner’s Guide to Victorian
Planning Schemes Version 1.5,
April 2022 (Practitioner’s Guide) sets
out key guidance to assist practitioners when preparing planning scheme
provisions.
The guidance seeks to ensure:
the intended
outcome is within scope of the objectives and power of the PE Act and has a
sound basis in strategic planning policy
a provision is
necessary and proportional to the intended outcome and applies the Victoria
Planning Provisions in a proper manner
a provision is
clear, unambiguous and effective in achieving the intended
