THE COURT (
Introduction
applicant and the respondent are in the midst of Family Court proceedings. Soon
after those proceedings commenced on 12 January
2024, the respondent reported an
alleged aggravated assault of her by the applicant, after which the applicant
was arrested by police.
Police obtained an interim intervention order.
applicant challenged the police intervention order and police withdrew it and
the criminal charge on 2 May 2024.
respondent then applied for an interim intervention order. An interim
intervention order was made and, at subsequent hearings,
the applicant did not
appear. On 27 June 2024 a magistrate ordered service by email pursuant to
s 21(8a)(b)

called on before a magistrate on 4 July 2024, service was proved and a
final intervention order was made.

parties were given an opportunity to file short written submissions together
with a brief opportunity to speak to those submissions
this morning. These were
directed to the applicant’s Amended appeal grounds – Revision 2,
whereas Revision 1 was the
subject of an application for leave to amend dated
2 October 2025, which was granted on 9 October 2025. Revision 2 is as
Introduction
These amended grounds are confined to errors by the single Judge. They do not
re-argue the merits of the intervention-order application.
They contend that the
primary Judge failed to grapple with the appellant’s central submissions
conduct and the fairness of the process below,
departed from earlier coordinate authorities without satisfying the
wrong’ threshold, and did not apply the practical-injustice
test to the real issues before that Appellate court. Further, these
“further” Amended Appeal Grounds - Revision 2, integrate all issues
raised in the comprehensive leave submissions (including
Special Circumstances).
Prior grounds are not abandoned to the extent consistent; these grounds
supersede and refine them.
A. Denial of procedural fairness (natural justice).
primary judge proceeded on the incorrect premise that the Appellant was in
default of the 30 April 2025 deadline and failed to
regularise or consider
interlocutory material lodged on 28 April 2025 and rejected by Registry on 29
April 2025, notwithstanding
contemporaneous notice to Chambers on 30 April 2025.
Further, the judge treated affidavit material as determinative without affording
the Appellant a fair opportunity to be heard and to test that material.
Notwithstanding that, final orders were upheld (in the Appellate
notwithstanding the absence of a merits hearing and any opportunity for
cross-examination on contested credibility; the central
fairness complaint was
not squarely addressed by HH the Appellate Judge.
reasons / failure to address a substantial, clearly-articulated issue
a) The primary Judge failed to engage with the appellant’s central
submission that the Magistrate, knowing the appellant had
been denied any merits
hearing and any opportunity to cross-examine the protected person on contested
allegations, nevertheless confirmed
the order. A court must respond to a
substantial, clearly-articulated argument based on established facts; failure to
do so is error
Dranichnikov v Minister for
Immigration
b) Particulars:
(i) Written/oral submissions squarely advanced that no trial on the merits
occurred and credibility was decided without cross-examination.
(ii) The reasons focus on notice/service and threshold issues but do not expose
reasoning on whether the Magistrate’s process
denied a fair hearing.
(iii) The omission prevents meaningful appellate review as it does not reveal
the path of reasoning on the determinative issue.
3. Failure to apply the ‘practical injustice’ analysis
a) The court treated the denial of cross-examination as harmless, rather than
asking whether the appellant lost a realistic chance
of a different outcome with
a fair hearing.
4. Procedural fairness misapplied: wrong issue addressed; wrong test
a) The primary Judge approached the matter as a question of notice/service,
rather than deciding whether the Magistrate’s process
produced practical
injustice by deciding disputed facts without permitting cross-examination. The
correct touchstone is practical
injustice (
Re Minister for Immigration
Ex parte Lam
[2003] HCA 6).
Where denial of fairness touches facts in
contest, the order should be set aside and
Stead v SGIC
(1986) 161 CLR 141).
b) Particulars:
(i) No evaluation of the fairness of confirming the order without a merit
hearing and without allowing cross-examination on the contested
allegations.
(ii) No application of the ‘practical injustice’ standard to the
issue actually raised by the appellant.
to consider orthodox relief (quash and remit) / misapplication of
‘inevitability’
(a) The orthodox remedy of setting aside and remitting for hearing according to
law was not considered or was rejected without reasons;
‘inevitability’ was misapplied.
6. Error in appellate function: failure to consider appropriate relief (set
aside and remit)
a) Having been squarely invited to address the Magistrate’s denial of a
merits hearing, the primary Judge failed to determine
whether that denial
required the confirmation to be quashed, and the matter remitted for a proper
hearing before a different Magistrate
with witnesses available for
cross-examination. On established principle, where procedural unfairness affects
facts in issue, the
appeal should be allowed and the matter remitted for
b) Particulars:
(i) No distinct consideration of the remedy of quashing and remitter to a
different Magistrate for a hearing
7. Threshold error as to leave/permission (Section 42
Magistrates Court Act
a) The primary Judge treated the appeal as one requiring permission and/or
characterised the Magistrate’s confirmation as interlocutory.
paragraphs [25]–[30] of the Reasons, the Appellate judge did not explain
why a Magistrate’s final confirmation order
should be treated as
interlocutory, nor why the appellant’s contrary arguments were rejected.
This constitutes inadequate reasons
and error of law.
permission/leave gateway was not determined (or was
misapprehended), vitiating the appellate pathway and relief analysis.
c) Particulars:
(i) No reasons given for rejecting the appellant’s contention that the
Magistrate’s confirmation was a final order.
(ii) Failure to engage with established authorities requiring explicit
justification when treating orders as interlocutory (
White v Police
[2028] SASC 123
JP v Police
[2024] SASC 114
Thakur v Police
[2016] SASC 75
[2009] SASC 8
[2013] SASC 51).
(iii) Constitutes a departure from the duty to give adequate reasons and the
principles of classification.
from coordinate authority without satisfying the ‘plainly wrong’
(stare decisis)
a) The primary Judge departed from, or failed to follow/distinguish, earlier
single-judge authorities on the leave/permission question
Nicholson J
Groom v Police (No 3)
[2013] SASC 93
Duncan v Police
[2015] SASC 146
[34]–[35]), without demonstrating those decisions were plainly wrong or
giving reasons adequate to justify non-compliance.
Principles of coherence and
comity require a single judge to follow a coordinate decision unless convinced
it is plainly wrong; at
minimum, reasons must be given for any departure

[1993] HCA 15
Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say
Dee Pty Ltd
(2007) 230 CLR 89
at [135]–[136]).
b) Particulars:
(i) Earlier single-judge decisions recognise that leave is not required under
the statutory appeal pathway; the reasons below do
not explain why those cases
are distinguished or plainly wrong.
(ii) The omission undermines consistency and predictability and constitutes an
error of law and/or inadequate reasons
from settled SA authority (including
JP v Police
[2024] SASC 114)
a) The judgment departed from, or failed to follow and distinguish, existing SA
authority (including
JP v Police
on forward-looking risk/appropriateness)
without identifying a principled basis and without explicit reasoning.
of explicit reasoning when doctrinal development is attempted (
Farah/Hill v

adhere to the ‘plainly wrong’ discipline before
departing from
intermediate appellate authority; reasons did not squarely engage with existing

a) Reliance upon redacted/unavailable reasons (including the limited public
) undermined stare decisis and procedural fairness
because the parties could not test, distinguish or address the reasoning.
to observe the discipline required when altering legal direction (illustrated by
Commonwealth v Yunupingu
[2025] HCA 6)
a) If the primary Judge intended to change direction from earlier single-judge
authority on the leave/permission question, the Judge
was required to identify
and justify that doctrinal shift expressly. The High Court’s approach in
Commonwealth v Yunupingu
[2025] HCA 6
—where the Court expressly
Teori Tau v Commonwealth
(1969) to correct doctrine —
illustrates (as ought to have been done by the Appellate Judge in the matter on
appeal) that legitimate
change requires open identification of the earlier
authority and a reasoned basis for departure. No equivalent reasoning is present
b) Particulars:
(i) No express engagement with, or displacement of, earlier single-judge
authority; no articulation of why earlier authority is plainly
(ii) Absent that analysis, the departure (if any) should not have occurred; the
matter should have been decided in accordance with
the earlier decisions or
of law – misdirection as to the appellate task under
(‘real review’).

Appellant’s interlocutory application lodged on

conducted no investigation of the allegations prior to initiating/pressing the
application. On 2 May 2024 the HH the Magistrate
failed to make proper inquiry
of the protected person before issuing the interim IO; and on 4 July 2024 in
confirming a final order,
it was also made without sworn or reliable evidence as
to present risk or appropriateness or any change in circumstances since 14th
January 2024 – when the initial SAPOL interim IO was imposed. The
statutory threshold was not met, and the (or any) discretion
miscarried.
“Reasonable
suspicion” requires plausible material facts with probative value —
not mere conjecture — before
a court may be satisfied of future risk and
the appropriateness of orders (
George v Rockett

House v The King

Misapprehension

Law Act mechanisms (ss
68Q, 68R, 69J, 114) on the ‘appropriateness’ limb, on SAPOL’s
initiation, and on the risk
of inconsistent orders; this amounted to error of
principle – and any reasonable judicial officer who had care and conduct
of the matter as late as 2 May and 4 July 2024 – would have enquired as to
any Family Law proceedings or any further developments
with the matter after
January 2024.

appeal judge observed that there was a division of authority over whether an
order confirming an intervention order was interlocutory
or final in nature.
Whilst most of the authorities suggested that the order was interlocutory in

the question whether the applicant had been given proper notice, the appeal
judge referred to a recent decision of
Commissioner of Police v Knight;
Commissioner of Police v
before addressing the
terms of the
Intervention Orders
The appeal Judge observed
that by s 21 of the
Intervention Orders Act
, an interim intervention
order comes into force when served, whether personally or in the manner
authorised by the Court. The appeal
judge also recognised that, once an interim
intervention order is confirmed, only the final intervention order
appeal judge then recorded the following concession by the
applicant ultimately, on appeal, accepted that he received on 27 June 2024
notice of the interim intervention order and notice
of the hearing of the final
intervention order confirmation
In the circumstances, I
reject the submission advanced by the applicant that he was not given notice of
the proceedings. I find that
the applicant was properly served with the interim
intervention order in accordance with the statutory
requirements,
and that he had
actual notice of the proceedings and was given notice prior to the confirmation
hearing of that hearing.
for the allegations of procedural unfairness, the appeal judge recognised that
s 20(3) of the
Intervention Orders Act
required that the respondent
inform the Magistrates Court about the existence of any Family Court proceedings
but that any failure
to do so did not invalidate the interim order nor occasion
any relevant procedural
unfairness.
Indeed, s 20(3) of
Intervention Orders Act
explicitly recognises that, while an
applicant must inform the Magistrates Court about any pending Family Court
proceedings, “an
intervention order is not invalid merely because the
applicant fails to so inform the Court”.
appeal judge addressed a number of other contentions, including an asserted lack
of jurisdiction, allegations of judicial error
and allegations of corrupt
conduct, before rejecting what was said to be a constitutional
appeal judge refused an extension of time, presumably because the proposed
appeal lacked sufficient merit to warrant a grant
of leave to appeal. She
otherwise dismissed the appeal.
The determination of the
application for leave to appeal
reviewed the reasons of the appeal judge against the Amended appeal grounds, it
is not immediately obvious that the appeal
judge has made any material error of
fact or law. To the extent any discretion was exercised, it was neither
unreasonably nor unjustly
exercised. The applicant has not identified any reason
to doubt or reconsider the decision of the appeal judge. He has not identified
any issue of principle or of general importance. He has not demonstrated that
allowing the decision to stand would work substantial
short, whilst police abandoned an interim intervention order and withdrew the
criminal charge, an interim intervention order was
sought and obtained by the
respondent and then, in accordance with orders made by the Magistrates Court,
the applicant was properly
served and given notice of the hearing at which the
interim order was confirmed as a final order.
there was a failure by the respondent’s counsel to formally advise the
magistrate about the extant Family Court proceedings,
which was “less than
the appeal judge
was not satisfied that this occasioned any “relevant practical
injustice”.
the heart of the applicant’s complaints is the proposition that he should
have been afforded what he described as a full
“merits hearing”,
permitting him to undertake a cross-examination of the respondent, ignoring that
he was given proper
notice and a reasonable opportunity to appear, but failed to
those circumstances, the many complaints made by the applicant lack merit. They
do not warrant a grant of leave to appeal. It
would not be in the interests of
justice to grant leave.
