What a relief! Here is a legal book which is clear in language and structure,
breaks down complex legal matters and covers basic legal
principles: the best
proof that law need not be expressed in some ancient English language with
strange grammatical and semantic
constructions hard to explain even for the
professionals. Peter Gillies fulfils his objective, as stated in his
introduction to the
first edition, 1988, ‘to improve the clarity of legal
writing and to structure material in a logical way’.
The first four chapters give a broad overview of the Australian legal system:
in the historical context, with its origin in the English
system; and, within
the Australian
Constitution
, the different sources of law (common law, equity,
statute law) as well as the court/tribunal system. As a German lawyer, I found
that this chapter gave me a useful introduction to the Australian legal system.
One important aspect of this book is the depth of analysis of contract law
(Chapters 7–25). This can only be welcomed, as contract
law is the basis
of everyday dealings as well as business agreements. Basic requirements for the
formation, terms and termination
of a contract and, on the other hand, vitiating
factors and remedies for breach of contract are fully discussed. In his
of contract law, Gillies refers to the leading cases and integrates
useful quotations from decisions into the text. The reader who
information can utilise the text to undertake further research.
Later chapters refer to important aspects of business law. Chapters
26–29 examine agency, partnership and property law (real,
personal and
intellectual). The discussion of intellectual property is up-to-date in
incorporating an analysis of the
(Cth). The topics of trust, succession and bailment deal with matters that are
relevant in business. The remaining chapters deal
fully with specific
legislation that is important for business: the
Trade Practices Act 1974
and the Fair Trading Acts which concern consumer protection (Chapter 33), as
well as regulating restrictive trade practices
(Chapter 39). A useful table at
the end of Chapter 33 refers to the provisions of the
Trade Practices Act 1974
(Cth) and the corresponding provisions in the Fair Trading Acts.
Business Law
is also a practical reference for ‘Credit
Law’ (Chapter 34) and ‘Insurance Law’ (Chapter 35). Chapter
‘Bills of Exchange’, and Chapter 37, ‘Banks and
Cheques’, offer a useful guide to the use of bills of exchange
cheques. Chapter 38, ‘Bankruptcy’, has a good discussion of the
process of invoking the bankruptcy jurisdiction,
and includes a useful
discussion of non-bankruptcy remedies, for example, arrangement with creditors.
Gillies has updated the chapter on company law (Chapter 40) to include the
changes brought in by the
Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 1999
The final two chapters, ‘Employment’ (Chapter 41) and ‘Debt
Collection’ (Chapter 42), are written by Tony
Smith. They are equally
clearly structured, containing easy-to-understand flow charts and tables. Debt
collection was newly added
to this edition and provides a lot of practical
guidance for the procedure of recovery of debts.
The most compelling feature of this book is that it is well written and easy
to understand. Each chapter contains a useful introduction
that places the topic
in context and often shows the development of the legal principles. The book
includes a comprehensive table
of statutes and cases. The index is excellent.
Business Law
is an ideal reference book about basic legal principles that
relate to business and are also relevant to legal practice. The publishers
should consider publishing this important work in hardcover, as it forms an
important part of the libraries of many practitioners
who use the work as a
first reference.
