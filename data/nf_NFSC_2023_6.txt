REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
BESANKO CJ:
9 November 2023, I delivered reasons for judgment on two applications one
involving the estate of William Nihill Champion late
of, Norfolk Island,
deceased and the other involving the estate of Sarah Clara Champion, late of,
Norfolk Island, deceased, (
Deputy Curator of Deceased Estates, in the matter
of Champion
[2023] NFSC 3).
I made an order that, to the extent necessary,
the Deputy Curator be heard further on the form of the orders to be made.
that point in time, there were two outstanding issues to be resolved. First, I
asked the Deputy Curator to consider whether where
there are two succeeding
executors and recognition of only one succeeding executor is sought, there is a
need to give notice to the
other succeeding executor. This situation arose in
the case of the estate of Isabella May Dillon (nee Champion) and the estate of
Alice Augusta Rendell (nee Champion).
publishing my principal reasons, the Deputy Curator advised the Court that Miles
Selwyn Dillon, succeeding executor under the
estate of Isabella May Dillon
(Isabella), died in September 2023. The second issue is whether there is a new
succeeding executor
under Isabella’s estate.
27 November 2023, solicitor for the Deputy Curator, Mr Frederick John Grose,
swore and filed an affidavit annexing further evidence
to address these
two applications came back before the Court on 28 November 2023. I made the
orders sought by the Deputy Curator and said that
I would deliver brief
additional reasons addressing the matters set out above. These are those
light of the further evidence provided in relation to the succeeding executors,
it is not necessary to resolve the first issue.
In the estate of Alice Augusta
Rendell (Alice), there were two succeeding executors, Geoffrey Court Rendell and
Henry Bruce Johnson.
The only order sought in relation to Alice’s estate
was an order recognising Geoffrey Court Rendell as the succeeding executor.
the principal reasons at [59], I decided that was an appropriate order and noted
there was no evidence as to the position and
circumstances of Mr Johnson.
Grose deposes that internet searches have since informed him that a Henry Bruce
Johnson, born at Auckland, New Zealand on 8 June
1918 and married to Josephine
Grace Johnson (nee Taylor), died in Auckland on 19 July 2006. Mr Grose states
that Geoffrey Court
Rendell has confirmed that the information relating to Mr
Johnson’s death is correct and advised that he was an executor of
Johnson’s will, but no longer holds any documentation. I am satisfied
that Mr Johnson died on 19 July 2006 and that Geoffrey
Court Rendell is the
sole succeeding executor under the estate of Alice.
the estate of Isabella, there were two succeeding executors, Miles Selwyn Dillon
and Anthony Clive Sandlant. The only order sought
in relation to
Isabella’s estate was an order recognising Miles Selwyn Dillon as the
succeeding executor. In the principal
reasons at [50], I concluded that was an
appropriate order and noted there was no evidence as to the position and
circumstances of
Mr Sandlant.
the death of Miles Selwyn Dillon, Mr Sandlant became the sole succeeding
executor. On 22 November 2023, Mr Sandlant signed a
document renouncing his
role of succeeding executor in the estate of Isabella. Mr Sandlant states that
at the time of acting as
executor in the estate of Lillian Selwyn Dillon, he was
a partner at a law firm in Auckland, New Zealand. Mr Sandlant is now 80
years old and retired from legal practice over 10 years ago.
Selwyn Dillon died in Auckland, New Zealand, on 1 September 2023. He left a
will dated 5 July 2023 and by his will, appointed
his sister, Rosemary Anne
Dillon and her partner, Gregory Victor Graydon, as his executors. Mr Grose
deposes that probate has been
applied for by the executors, but has not yet been
granted and may take some months.
probate being granted to them, Rosemary Anne Dillon and Gregory Victor Graydon
will be succeeding executors in the estate of
Isabella. In November 2023,
Gregory Victor Graydon signed a document renouncing his role of succeeding
executor in the estate of
Isabella. Mr Grose states that Rosemary Anne
Dillon is prepared to act as succeeding executor is the estate of Isabella to
distribution in the estates of Sarah Clara champion and William Nihill
Champion subject to probate of the will of Miles Selwyn Dillon
being granted.
order sought in relation to Isabella’s estate was that upon the issue of a
grant of probate of the will of Miles Selwyn
Dillon, Rosemary Anne Dillon is the
succeeding executor under the estate of Isabella May Champion deceased. In the
circumstances,
that was an appropriate order.
