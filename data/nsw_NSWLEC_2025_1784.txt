are jurisdictional prerequisites that must be satisfied before this function can
be exercised. The parties identify the jurisdictional

how the jurisdictional prerequisites have been
satisfied in a jurisdictional statement provided to the Court, allowing the

Modification Application is supported by a Supplementary Town Planning Statement
prepared by Urbis dated 29 October 2025 (Planning
Statement) that assists the
Court in considering whether the development as proposed to be modified is of no
or minimal environmental
impact (s 4.55(1A)(a) of the EPA Act), and whether that
development is the same or substantially the same development as the development
for which consent was originally granted (s 4.55(1A)(b) of the EPA Act).
am satisfied that the development as proposed to be modified is of minimal
environmental impact, and that it is the same or substantially

reasons set out in the Planning Statement,

building footprint, building height, gross floor area
or the number of car
parking spaces or their physical dimensions.

the development was approved.
(3) Thirdly, there is no requirement to amend the terms of any other consent
condition that would result in an additional impact
beyond what was contemplated
and assessed prior to the granting of the Original Consent.

accordance with the Georges River Community Engagement
Strategy in accordance
s 4.55(1A)(c) of the EPA Act. No submissions were received. As such,

EPA Act has no work to do.
