After more than half a century of contemplation and controversy, deep-sea
mining is becoming increasingly technologically and economically
However, despite its potential, deep-sea mining poses serious environmental and
political threats. Understanding the legal
regimes that regulate deep-sea mining
is crucial for understanding its prospects and consequences and for establishing
governance.
This article explores the impact of territorial disputes in the South
China Sea (‘SCS’) on the regulation of deep-sea
mining in the
region. It begins by charting the existing territorial disputes in the SCS and
the salience of seabed resources to

regimes under which deep-sea mining may be conducted and their comparative
benefits. After

regimes, the article analyses the serious challenges posed to these

Deep-sea mining may

national jurisdiction) or in the Area.

challenges as deep-sea mining

As resource insecurity grows and technological capability develops, resource
extraction of hydrocarbons and critical minerals in the
deep sea is becoming
increasingly viable.

The legal governance of deep-sea mining is crucial for both its prospects and
consequences, including whether effective regulation
of both the industry and
its effects on the marine environment can be
established.
This is especially the case in areas where maritime entitlements and associated
boundaries remain unresolved and where tensions exist
between coastal states.
The South China Sea (‘SCS’) is one such
As explained further below, these tensions arise because of significant contest
between states over their territorial claims to islands,
rocks, low-tide
elevations, reefs and shoals scattered throughout the SCS. In addition, there
are differing views as to the characterisation
of these features under
and, consequently, their entitlements to maritime zones under the
law of the sea.
This determines
whether these features generate a continental shelf, which ultimately impacts
the delineation of the SCS deep seabed
This article explores the impact of territorial disputes in the SCS on the
legal aspects of deep-sea mining on the continental shelf
and in the Area. Given
the existing resource and environmental controversies in the SCS, further
disagreement between coastal states
(and potentially the broader international
community) will increase legal and geopolitical tensions in the region. We begin
charting the existing SCS territorial disputes and the growing
salience of deep-sea mining in these disputes, before identifying
regimes under which deep-sea mining may be conducted. We analyse the intense
uncertainty around these regimes in the SCS.
In particular, the 2016 award in
South China Sea Arbitration
constraints on the ability of coastal states to claim part of the SCS seabed
because of its findings regarding the
inability of some features to generate a
continental shelf.
In this context, the presence of various disputes in the region presents
serious challenges to legal and regulatory systems. Several
aspects of the
current framework interact to create a legal impasse, including the current
approach to assessing continental shelf
claims in disputed areas, the lack of
any clear deadline to make continental shelf claims, and the ambiguous
relationship between
delineation and delimitation of maritime boundaries. The
resulting inability to conclusively determine the limits of national sovereignty
over the seabed in disputed areas results in a regulatory vacuum.
As a result of these issues, this article concludes that general legal
regimes for deep-sea mining in the SCS are severely constrained
by territorial
contests. Any form of deep-sea mining will therefore likely occur through
unilateral, bilateral or trilateral action
outside international law frameworks.
These conclusions are also relevant to the prospects and regulation of deep-sea
mining in all
areas where territoriality or maritime boundaries are contested.
By analysing the challenges that conflict poses to current legal
regimes for
deep-sea mining in contested areas, this article may inform the evolution of
more effective regulatory regimes.
Part II of this article outlines the context by describing current
territorial claims in the SCS and the impact of seabed resource
disputes on
these claims. Part III then outlines the legal regimes under which seabed
(including deep-sea) mining can be conducted
and their implications for the
regulation and profitability of such mining. After assessing the impact of the
South China Sea
Arbitration
on these regimes, Part IV analyses the
serious challenges posed to regimes by the presence of regional disputes. It
concludes that
the interaction between various governing rules, systems and
bodies results in an inability to conclusively determine the limits
of national
sovereignty over the seabed in disputed areas and, consequently, a regulatory
lacuna. Part V outlines the implications
of this lacuna for the future of
deep-sea mining in the SCS. This article seeks to reflect law and state practice
up to April 2024.

Nineteen of the total
31 exploration contracts granted by the ISA relate to this Zone, including two
contracts granted to China.
However, as technological capability grows, deep-sea mining is likely to expand
to other parts of the Area (current areas being explored
include the Western
Pacific Ocean, Central Indian Ocean and Central Indian Ridge, and Mid-Atlantic
Ridge) and to claimed areas of
continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles that
are contested. Importantly, any mining in the ISA-regulated Clarion-Clipperton
(or other parts of the Area) will be subject to mining regulations
including the exploration regulations and the emerging exploitation
regulations.
The developing ISA regulatory regime applicable to mining in the Area, outlined
below, may make deep-sea mining in the
continental shelf comparatively more
profitable. Mining by the coastal state in the continental shelf will not be
subject to this
regime, which in the ISA-regulated Area may include costly
administrative and environmental obligations alongside profit-sharing
requirements. This may make SCS deep-sea mining more attractive: ‘the best
way for China to ensure continued access to these
seabed minerals ... would be
to treat [waters holding minerals] as sovereign
territory’.
It is important to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of SCS disputes, which
are driven not only by seabed resources but also by
fisheries conflicts and
other political factors.
Nonetheless, territorial conflicts are undeniably and inextricably intertwined
with seabed mining in the SCS. As shown above, competition
over seabed resources
has fuelled — and will continue to fuel — territorial conflict in
the SCS. Inversely, seabed resources
are also used as a tool to reinforce
assertions of territorial sovereignty. Surveys, research and resource
exploitation may all be

IV UNCERTAINTY IN THE SOUTH
The conduct and profitability of seabed mining by a coastal state therefore
depends on its territorial sovereignty and on certainty
as to the maritime
entitlements that may be generated offshore its coast (including from both
adjacent and distant islands). In the
SCS, there are multiple factors that
contribute to uncertainty as to the extent of a coastal state’s
continental shelf and
the extent of the Area within which other interested
states may be able to operate under an ISA-administered framework consistently
with the Part XI regime. Two aspects in particular add to that uncertainty:
overlapping maritime claims and the CLCS process to obtain
recommendations as to
the extent of the juridical continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles.
Overlapping
Asserted continental shelf claims between opposite or adjacent states may
overlap in three ways: first, where each coastal state asserts
a continental
shelf of no more than 200 nautical miles; second, where one state’s
200-nautical-mile entitlement overlaps with
another state’s ECS; and
third, where states have overlapping ECS claims.
The first type of overlapping claim to the seabed can be resolved through
general delimitation dispute resolution mechanisms as outlined

claimant states, only China has made such a

In general, dispute resolution takes place through
arbitration.
Both the second and third types of overlapping claim have been significantly
affected by jurisprudence. The possibility of the second
claim, albeit rare and to date subject to little state practice, was addressed
by the recent decision of the

V IMPLICATIONS AND
CONCLUSIONS
The SCS is one of the most deeply contested areas in the world. The geography
of the region is highly complex. It involves numerous
proximate states with long
histories of engagement, making individual and collective territorial claims
over hundreds of features,
each with varying legal status. The intersection of
these issues with
maritime entitlements creates exceptional
challenges for notions of territoriality that have rarely been encountered since
War Two. These challenges are particularly evident in the juridical
continental shelf and the Area because of the deep seabed’s
resources. This intensifies the territorial, maritime and resource-related
challenges over deep-sea mining.
As a result, it is unlikely that deep seabed activities or resolution of
territorial challenges in the SCS will be conducted within
the mechanisms
originally devised by

aspects mutually reinforce each other.
As outlined above, the CLCS, ISA and
Part XV dispute settlement
bodies all lack a clearly defined role in resolving these SCS issues. This is
due to the complexity of
the SCS’s territorial and maritime issues and
was not designed as a legal instrument to resolve and
manage territorial issues. Outside of
frameworks, other
extra-juridical resolution mechanisms may gather support. Joint development
agreements can occur within existing
legal frameworks (such as provisional
arrangements between states with continental shelf delimitation disputes under
) or outside these frameworks (such as between SCS states

The latter is

the impotency of legal frameworks

exploitation of the SCS seabed by multiple states is
continually taking place.
Such unilateral exploitation may be incentivised by recent international
judicial treatment of oil and gas activities in disputed
seabed areas. In

perspective, it is possible that the allure of deep-sea mining may in fact drive
SCS claimant states to politically cooperate
and resolve disputes in order to
circumvent paralysis within regulatory bodies and create a secure regime for
their investments.
The environmental dimension of these issues should not be ignored. In
addition to calls for a mineral mining moratorium being applied
to the Area,
Virginie C Tilot et al have recently proposed specific management tools such as
a sustainability index adapted to deep-sea
mining for solid minerals in order to
foster sustainability and engagement with affected
communities.
implementation of such measures requires clarity on the legal regime under which
any deep-sea mining is operating and the bodies
responsible for managing it.
Although mechanisms such as joint development zones may allow deep-sea mining
(including hydrocarbon
extraction) to proceed in the face of territorial
conflicts, the absence of a secure role for the CLCS, ISA or dispute settlement
bodies presents challenges to the effective governance of resource extraction in
these areas. For example, imposing the various obligations
and protections set
— such as benefit-sharing and environmental
protection requirements — faces serious
The need for
regulation is not limited to these issues — the 2023 Nauru incident
referred to above, in which the ISA felt compelled
to intervene in a conflict
between environmental protestors and a contractor, demonstrates the highly
volatile nature of these activities
and the need for effective
governance.
As shown, the extent and complexity of territorial disputes in the SCS bar
any resolution of ECS claims. This means the legal regime
applicable to deep-sea
mining cannot be established in the short-to-medium term. Not only is it
impossible to determine the Area’s
limits, but it is practically
impossible to legally resolve delimitation disputes between overlapping
continental shelf claims and
entitlements. The legal regimes and bodies created
to govern deep-sea mining are effectively thwarted.
Although the above factors indicate that deep-sea mining in the SCS will
likely occur outside the mechanisms originally devised in
these activities, it remains important to understand the legal framework in
which these developments are occurring. This is vital
to hold states accountable
for breaches of international law and to identify and correct deficiencies in
that law. As deep-sea mining
becomes increasingly viable and profitable,
effective regulation will be key to ensuring exploitation occurs in an
environmentally
and economically sustainable manner.

For the purpose of the

that the publicly available material
associated with a CLCS submission is an
‘Executive Summary’ and not the full submission made by a coastal
State. Nevertheless,
an Executive Summary does provide sufficient detail to
enable an appreciation of which areas of land and associated territorial sea
baselines are being relied upon to assert an entitlement to a continental shelf
beyond 200 nautical miles.
