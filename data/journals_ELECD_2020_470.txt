Abstract/Description:
The need to resolve overcapacity problems in domestic industry is frequently cited as a key reason for the Chinese government’s
promotion of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). This chapter analyses the relationship between industrial overcapacity in China
and the BRI. It assesses the degree to which the BRI and the related policy of “production capacity sharing” has had
or may have an impact in overcapacity in China, and whether this domestic factor can explain China’s apparent attempt to reshape
the global economic order through the BRI. The chapter uses trade and investment data and policy documents to analyse the relationship
between the BRI and overcapacity, focusing on the steel and cement sectors as key inputs to infrastructure, which is central to the
construction of the BRI. It argues that while overcapacity is a key domestic policy concern, the BRI can have only marginal impact
even if reducing overcapacity were its goal. In this regard the BRI makes no global governance contribution to resolving the overcapacity
problem, which, from a Chinese perspective, is dependent largely on domestic policy measures.
