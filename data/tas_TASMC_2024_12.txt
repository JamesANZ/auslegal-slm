REASONS FOR DECISION FAIRLEY, M
10 December 2024
Introduction
defendant is charged with one count of drive a motor vehicle whilst a prescribed
illicit drug is present in his oral fluid contrary
Road Safety (Alcohol
and Drugs) Act
). It is alleged Mr
Marshall was driving on Watkinson Street, Devonport on 28 June 2023 with
delta-nine-tetrahydrocannabinol
) in his oral fluid.
factual circumstances underpinning the charge were uncontentious. By a set of
agreed facts it was established Mr Marshall was
driving his motor vehicle on a
public street when intercepted by police and subjected to an oral fluid test. As
a result of the positive
roadside test he then became liable to submit to oral
fluid collection and analysis. All of the requirements of the legislation were
met in relation to the collection and analysis of the defendant’s oral
fluid. A certificate of analysis tendered pursuant to
of the Act confirmed
the presence of THC in Mr Marshall’s oral fluid sample.
concluded the prosecution case. Mr Marshall elected to give evidence. He did not
dispute he had consumed THC prior to driving
on 28 June 2023, but said the THC
had been obtained pursuant to a medical prescription. He gave detailed evidence
of the prescription
and dispensing process, which I will not repeat here other
than to say the evidence was such as to satisfy me the cannabis was lawfully
prescribed by a medical practitioner situated in Victoria. The cannabis itself
was dispensed from a pharmacy also in Victoria and
carried by Australia Post to
the defendant’s Tasmanian address. I make no specific comment upon the
legality of the supply
Marshall went on to give evidence about his use of the prescribed cannabis via a
Therapeutic Goods Administration approved vaporiser
and cannabis oil via
droplets administered orally. The defendant said he had self-administered
cannabis in the early hours of 28
June 2023 to assist with sleep. He maintained
that by the time he commenced driving on the day in question he was not feeling
of the primary effects of the THC. Such is consistent with the observations
of the intercepting police officers.
cross-examination Mr Marshall said he was unaware that medicinal cannabis could
be obtained from a Tasmanian based medical
practitioner. Further, that he had
sourced his information concerning the legalities around medicinal cannabis use
and driving from
an internet chat forum. He said it was his belief that it was
lawful to drive after using medicinally prescribed cannabis so long
under the influence”
concluded the evidence on the hearing. The defendant advanced two arguments via
his counsel:
the defence provided by
of the Act applied to the circumstances of his
case; or alternatively
was entitled to rely upon the defence, or more properly the ground of
exculpation, of honest and reasonable mistake of fact.
of the Act provides:
(1) Subject to
subsection (2)
a person who drives a motor vehicle while a prescribed illicit drug is present
in his or her blood or oral fluid is guilty of an
(2) A person does not commit an offence
subsection (1)
the prescribed illicit drug was obtained and administered in accordance with
the purposes of the Act a
“prescribed illicit drug”
defined as a
“drug prescribed in the regulations as an illicit
. The list of illicit drugs is set out in
regulation 15
Road Safety (Alcohol and Drugs) Regulations
and includes delta-nine-tetrahydrocannabinol.
the defence provided by s 6A(2) of the Act to apply, Mr Marshall must establish
on the balance of probabilities that the THC detected
in his system at the
relevant time originated from THC which had been
“obtained and
administered in accordance with the
Poisons Act
operation of
Poisons Act
, the legislation adopts the uniform standard published by the
Therapeutic Goods Act
(Cth) including
“Poisons List”
Substances”
which relevantly include THC.
Section 59E
Poisons Act
provides authority to the Secretary to authorise a
medical practitioner to make available THC for use by a particular patient upon
application.
Poisons Act
practitioner”
“a medical practitioner, except in
and VA in which case the medical practitioner must be present in
Tasmania and acting in the course of medical practice in Tasmania”
Section 59E
falls under
Poisons Act
. The effect of
those provisions is that a medical practitioner may prescribe cannabis for use
by a patient only if that practitioner
is present in Tasmania and acting in the
course of medical practice in Tasmania and has made the appropriate application
to the Secretary
in accordance with the legislation.
evidence presented by Mr Marshall clearly indicates the THC detected in his oral
fluid was not the result of a prescription obtained
from a medical practitioner
present in Tasmania and acting in the course of medical practice in Tasmania. It
was therefore not obtained
and administered in accordance with the
. The defence provided by s 6A(2) of the Act does not apply.
s 6A of the Act creating an offence of strict liability, the common law defence
“honest and reasonable mistake
applies (see
L v The Queen
[1985] TASSC 44
He Kaw Teh v The Queen
[1985] HCA 43.).
application of the defence was addressed by the Full Court in
Hindrum v Lane
[2014] TASFC 5.
In summary,
the Full Court found that the defendant bears the evidentiary onus of raising
the issue of honest and reasonable mistake
of fact and that, if there is
sufficient evidence such that the burden is satisfied, then prosecution must
prove guilt beyond reasonable
doubt, which includes excluding the defence.
mistake relied upon by a defendant must be one of fact and not of law. I refer
to the oft-quoted passage from
(2008) 236 CLR 440
where Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Crennan and Kiefel JJ
said (at 982):
“Honest and reasonable mistakes of fact do
not cover the whole field of risk of criminal liability to which a person may be
exposed by making an error. Mistakes of law are not a ground of exculpation:
ignorance of the law is no excuse... The concept of
mistake itself is protean.
The state of mind that, in a given set of circumstances, will qualify as a
mistaken belief in a fact or
state of affairs may be a matter of difficulty. An
honest and reasonable belief in a certain fact or state of affairs may be very
different from an absence of concern”.
the evidence of Mr Marshall is that his internet research convinced him it was
lawful to drive a motor vehicle after consuming
THC legitimately prescribed to
him by a medical practitioner from another state or territory so long as he was
“under the influence”
. For the reasons already addressed
that advice was wrong. Clearly the defendant’s mistake was one of law
alone and the defence
is therefore not available. However, even if I am wrong as
to that and the defendant’s belief was one of fact, it was not a
reasonably held. Mr Marshall said he gained his knowledge concerning driving
with lawfully prescribed THC in his body from
an internet chat forum rather than
from a legal practitioner or other proper authority. As such I find he could not
reasonably rely
upon said information as the basis for his mistaken belief.
the reasons set out above I find the single count on complaint 52746/2023
