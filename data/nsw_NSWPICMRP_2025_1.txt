STATEMENT OF REASONS
INTRODUCTION
Shane Wade (the claimant) sustained injury in a motor vehicle accident on
February 2024 (the accident).
Wade lodged an Application for Personal Injury Benefits dated 27 February 2024.

statutory benefits to the claimant under the
Motor Accident Injuries Act
insurer accepted Mr Wade’s claim for statutory benefits under the MAI Act
for 52 weeks from the date of the accident.
dispute is the amount of the claimant’s pre-accident weekly earnings
(PAWE). At the time of the accident Mr Wade was self-employed
handyman/painter/project manager.
insurer concedes Mr Wade is an “earner” as defined by Sch 1, cl 2 of
the MAI Act.
5 April 2024, the insurer determined Mr Wade’s PAWE as
The insurer relied upon a
report from Procare Forensic Accountants dated 5 April 2024.
14 October 2024 Mr Wade sought a review of this
determination.
He sought to rely
upon an amended 2023 Individual Taxation Return (amended FY23 ITR).
an internal review decision dated 5 November 2024 the insurer determined the
claimant’s PAWE was $163.02.
The insurer noted the amended FY23ITR included cash income of $42,240 and the
exclusion of business expenses in the sum of $61,063.
The amended FY23ITR
resulted in an increase in gross earnings to $131,871. In the absence of
supporting evidence showing receipt
of this additional income, the insurer
calculated the PAWE on the 12-month earnings as reconciled with bank statements
of $12,480 less business expenses of $8,477 divided by 52 weeks to
arrive at a PAWE of $163.20.
13 November 2024 Mr Wade sought an internal review of the Internal Review
decision dated 5 November 2024.
a letter dated 22 November 2024 the insurer advised given an internal review had
already been conducted and no further decision
had been made the insurer
declined to conduct a further internal

a decision dated 2 July 2025, the President’s delegate referred the
application for review of the decision of Merit Reviewer
Medland to this Review
Panel (Panel) pursuant to s 7.15 of the MAI Act.
9 July 2025 the Panel directed the claimant on or before 17 July 2025 to upload
to the portal an indexed and paginated bundle of
all evidence sought to be
relied upon in the review. The insurer was directed to upload to the portal an
indexed and paginated bundle
of all evidence sought to be relied upon by 24 July
25 July 2025 the insurer uploaded to the portal an indexed bundle of documents
paginated from pages 1 to 118 (insurer’s documents).
29 July 2025 the claimant uploaded to the portal an indexed bundle of documents
paginated from pages 1 to 182 (claimant’s
documents).
26 August 2025 in response to a direction from the Panel the insurer uploaded to
the portal Schedules 4 and 5 of the Procare report
dated 23 January 2025.
THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION
3.3 of the MAI Act deals with an injured person’s entitlement to weekly
payments of statutory benefits.
3.6 and 3.7 set out an entitlement to weekly payments calculated with reference
to the “pre-accident weekly earnings”.
1 of the MAI Act sets out the definitions relating to “earner” and
“pre-accident weekly earnings”
for the purposes of statutory weekly
payments under Div 3.3.
1, cl 2 of the MAI Act provides:
“Meaning of
A person who is injured as a result of a motor accident is
an earner if the person is at least 15 years of age and who—
(a) was employed or self-employed (whether or not full-time)—
(i) at any time during the 8 weeks immediately preceding the motor accident,
(ii) during a period or periods equal to at least 13 weeks during the year
immediately preceding the motor accident, or
(iii) during a period or periods equal to at least 26 weeks during the 2 years
immediately preceding the motor accident,
and, at the date of the motor accident, had not retired permanently from all
employment, or
1, cl 3 provides:
“Meaning of ‘loss of
(1) Loss of earnings means a loss incurred or likely to be incurred in
a person’s income from personal exertion.
(2) A person’s income from personal exertion is—
(a) the amount that is the income of the person consisting of earnings,
salaries, wages, commissions, fees, bonuses, pensions, retiring
allowances and
retiring gratuities, allowances and gratuities received in the capacity of
employee or in relation to any services
rendered, and
(b) the proceeds of any business carried on by the person either alone or in
partnership with any other person, and
(c) any amount received as bounty or subsidy in carrying on a business.
person’s income from personal exertion does not
(a) interest, unless the person’s principal business consists of the
lending of money, or unless the interest is received
in respect of a debt due to
the person for goods supplied or services rendered by the person in the course
of the person’s
business, or
(b) rents or dividends, or
(c) any employer superannuation contributions, or
(d) the monetary amount of any annual, sick or other leave entitlement.”
1, cl 4 provides:
“Meaning of ‘pre-accident weekly
earnings’--general
(1) ‘Pre-accident weekly earnings’, in relation to an earner who
is injured as a result of a motor accident, means the
weekly average of the
gross earnings received by the earner as an earner during the 12 months
immediately before the day on which
the motor accident occurred, unless
subclause (2) applies.
(2) In the following cases,
’pre-accident weekly
in relation to an earner who is injured as a result of a
motor accident, means--
(a) if, on the day of the motor accident, the earner was earning continuously,
but had not been earning continuously for at least
12 months--the weekly average
of the gross earnings received by the earner as an earner during the period from
when the earner started
to earn continuously to immediately before the day of
the motor accident,
(a1) if the earner was employed or self-employed during a period or periods
equal to at least 26 weeks during the first year of the
pre-accident period, but
was not obtaining earnings from any source at any other time during the
pre-accident period--the average
weekly gross earnings received by the earner as
an earner during the first year of the pre-accident period,
(b) if subclause (3) applies--the weekly average of the gross earnings the
earner received as an earner, or could reasonably have
been expected to receive,
during the 12 months after the change of circumstance referred to in the
subclause occurred,
(c) if the earner is an earner by reason of having entered into an arrangement
with an employer or other person to undertake employment
or to commence business
as a self-employed person--the average weekly gross earnings that the earner
could reasonably have been expected
to earn, but for the injury, in employment
under that arrangement.
‘pre-accident period’
, in relation to a motor
accident, is the period of 2 years immediately preceding the motor
(3) This subclause applies if, during the 12 months immediately before the
day of the motor accident, there was, as a result of any
action taken by the
earner, a significant change in his or her earnings circumstances that resulted
in the earner regularly earning,
or becoming entitled to earn, more on a weekly
basis than he or she was earning before the change occurred.
Examples of a change of circumstances to which this subclause
would apply include a change of job, a promotion, a move from part-time
full-time employment, or a pay increase arising from the achievement of
performance standards.
(4) For the purposes of this clause, an earner earns continuously if he or
she obtains earnings from permanent employment or from
a source that, on the day
of the motor accident, was likely to continue for a period of at least 6 months
to provide earnings to
the earner on the same, or a similar, basis to the basis
on which the earnings were being provided as at that day.”
DECISION OF MERIT REVIEWER MEDLAND
Reviewer Medland issued a certificate and reasons for decision dated 14 May
She set aside the reviewable
decision and assessed the claimant’s PAWE at $334.01.
Reviewer Medland noted the matter proceeded to an assessment conference by way
of oral submissions only. Mr Wade did not provide
a statement, and he did not
give evidence at the assessment conference. The claimant relied on a report of
Anthony Carmody &
Associates dated 5 November 2024. The insurer relied on
three reports of Procare Forensics (Procare).
primary submission for the claimant was that the Procare reports disregarded the
claimant’s amended income tax return for
the financial year ending 2023
and should not be considered where their preparation constituted a denial of
procedural fairness.
Furthermore, it was submitted the amended FY23 ITR and the
amended Notice of Assessment (amended FY23 NA) provide conclusive evidence
the claimant’s gross earnings. The insurer submitted the amended FY23 ITR
was unreliable where there has been a failure
of the claimant to declare
business expenses and where it cannot be reconciled with source documentation
such as invoices and bank
statements.
Reviewer Medland found the relevant period for the calculation of the PAWE was
from 21 February 2023 to 20 February 2024. In
considering whether the amended
FY23 ITR can be relied upon as conclusive evidence of the claimant’s
income, she noted the
financial year only runs from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023
so inevitably other material must be considered to calculate earnings during
relevant period. Therefore, Merit Reviewer Medland found the amended FY23 ITR
cannot be considered “conclusive” evidence
for the purposes of
calculation of PAWE. She concurred with the reasons of Merit Reviewer Ruschen in
Ataei v QBE Insurance (Australia)
who found that taxation
summaries and business activity statements were not sufficient to determine PAWE
over a precise pre-accident
Reviewer Medland noted she had been taken to a number of cases dealing with the
conclusiveness of the amended FY23 ITR. She
noted that the findings in
Bloemen Pty Ltd v Commissioner of
conclusiveness of an assessment was questioned in
David Jones Finance and
Investments and
Adsteam Finance and Investments
Commissioner of Taxation
concluded that an assessment can be challenged in certain circumstances.
Reviewer Medland concluded she was not satisfied the amended FY23 ITR was
reliable evidence for the purposes of calculating
PAWE over the relevant period
for the following reasons:
(a) it does not cover the relevant period for the purposes of Schedule 1 of the
(b) the other documentation provided, such as bank statements, the FY2022 and
original FY2023 individual taxation returns put into
doubt the accuracy of the
(c) the document was prepared well after the claim was lodged and the initial
determination of PAWE by the insurer was made, and
(d) it defies commonsense that the claimant’s business would not have
incurred any business related expenses for the 2023
financial year. The nature
of the claimant’s business of itself means that it is more likely than not
that expenses were incurred.
This is further verified by other documentation
such as the Bunnings expenses summary and expenses declared in the 2022 and
2023 taxation return. There was no explanation given as to why there
would have been no business expenses in the 2023 financial year.
In the absence
of any such explanation, she found on the balance of probabilities that business
expenses were in fact incurred.
Reviewer Medland agreed that cash payments should be considered in the
calculation of PAWE, however only when supported by evidence
to verify the
receipt of the cash payment. She noted in the absence of any evidence from the
claimant there is no evidence to verify
the cash payments other than the amended
FY23 ITR. As previously noted, she did not consider the amended FY23 ITR
reliable evidence
upon which to assess the claimant’s PAWE.
relation to the Procare report, Merit Reviewer Medland concluded there may have
been some inappropriate discussions between the
claimant and the author of the
report. However, she found that the ultimate conclusions contained in the report
were based on the
source documentation.
Reviewer Medland stated she found the approach taken by a Review Panel in the
NRMA Insurance v Sarkis Iskandar
to be correct when calculating
PAWE for self-employed persons. That is, the term “gross earnings”
in Sch 1, cl 4 of the
MAI Act means gross business earnings less total business
expenses but before the deduction of taxation.
Reviewer Medland found that the reasoning of the report of Anthony Carmody &
Associates did not follow the requirements
of Sch 1 of the MAI Act and was of no
assistance in the assessment of PAWE.
Reviewer Medland accepted the conclusions and calculations of Procare to be the
most accurate assessment of PAWE on the evidence
available. She calculated the
claimant’s PAWE in accordance with the Procare report of 23 January 2025,
being $334.01.
THE EVIDENCE
Application for personal injury benefits dated 28 February 2024 describes Mr
Wade as a handyman/painter/project manager with earnings
of $100,000
Wade filed a Schedule of Earnings in which he stated the PAWE for the first 13
weeks post-accident, that is from 12 February 2024
to 13 May 2024, was the sum
of $2,535.98 and the PAWE thereafter was the sum of
of Anthony Carmody
Wade relied upon a report of Anthony Carmody, certified practising accountant,
5 November 2024.
Carmody relied upon a report from Finder into Australian Household Spending for
the year ended 31 December 2023 which stated that
the average household spent
$132,372 in 2023, equivalent to $2,546 per week. He undertook an analysis of
bank statements from Qudos
Bank for the period 1 January 2022 to 31 December
Mr Carmody calculated the loss of income suffered by Mr Wade in the
sum of $63,252.35 calculated as follows:
(a) annual income required for an average Australian family as per the report
from Finder Australia $132,372.3;
(b) less funds drawn from Qudos Bank $24,803.25, and
(c) less net income provided by Lisa Wade, the claimant’s spouse,
$44,316.70.
Carmody divided the sum of $63,252.35 by 52 (weeks) to arrive at a loss of
$1,216.39 per week.
Carmody’s calculation is based on “required funds” from a
Finder Australia report. There is no reference to the
MAI Act or other relevant
legislation. Further, there is no basis on which Mr Carmody says the Finder
Australia report, or the net
income provided by the claimant’s spouse is
relevant to the determination of the claimant’s PAWE. Accordingly, the
places no weight on the conclusions of Mr Carmody or his

insurer has also provided emails documenting conversations between
representatives of Procare, the claimant, and the
claimant has asserted that the exchanges between Procare and him involved an
obvious power inequality and a prejudicial denial
of procedural fairness where
the claimant was encouraged to disclose information which was confidential and
legally privileged.
Accordingly,
the Panel has not considered these emails for the purposes of the
Forensic accounting reports
insurer provided a Procare report of Ms Davis dated 5 April 2024 and a Procare
report of Mr Paul Croft dated 23 September 2025.
a further report of Mr Paul Croft dated 23 January 2025 was said to supersede
the two earlier reports.
Panel only proposes to address the report dated 23 January
Outstanding information
Croft reported the following information was requested from the claimant but not
receipts for all
cash work in the relevant period;
breakdown of FY22 purchases and other costs in in FY22 ITR, and
explanation for the omission of expenses from his amended FY23
Amended FY23 ITR
amended FY23 ITR lodged on 9 September 2024 increased the claimant’s
taxable income to $131,871 comprising:
undeclared “additional cash income” of $42,240, and
the reduction of
$61,063 in business expenses to Nil.
Croft concluded the amended FY23 ITR was not an accurate record of the
claimant’s actual FY23 taxable income. He states the
amended FY23 total
income does not reconcile to amounts invoiced by him and deposits received by
him in the FY23. Further, where
the claimant has continued to operate the same
business, he states it is not reasonable for the claimant to incur no business
in the FY23 given he declared business expenses in the FY22 of $71,868.
He states even if the business income is net of reimbursements,
the claimant
ought to have incurred non-reimbursable expenses, such as motor vehicle expenses
and insurance.
relation to expenses Mr Croft makes the following observations about payments
shown in the claimant’s bank statements:
the claimant
consistently made payments to Bunnings;
other payments
were made for fuel, to NRMA, Reece, IKEA and Trilogy Contracting;
the claimant
made a payment of $905 to Adaman Plumbing on 7 March 2023;
the claimant
made a payment of $300 to Sean Muggy on 10 March 2023 for “Sparky
Account” presumably for electrical services,
the claimant
made a payment of $88 to Unique Plaster on 27 April 2023.
Reconciliation of quotes/invoices with bank
of the bank deposits shows that total FY23 cash deposits of $99,229 are $32,642
lower than total income in the amended FY23
ITR ($131,871).
Croft states based on invoices issued by the claimant it appears that the
claimant is reimbursed for some expenses incurred so
the sum of $99,229 may
represent not only personal exertion income but also reimbursements from
review of the documents Mr Croft assumed that a deposit of $3,181 received from
Cheryl Garrard (Keane) on 23 May 2023 was an overpayment
and excluded it from
his calculation.
relevant period referenced by Mr Croft is from 21 February 2023 to 20 February
Croft reported quotes and invoices for the relevant period, verified by the bank
statements, total $42,915 which he included in
the total assumed income.
However, in calculating income in the sum of $42,915 Mr Croft made adjustments
for actual errors and possible
errors he identified in the claimant’s
invoices. This includes charging GST on four occasions even though the claimant
registered for GST and is not entitled to charge it, a quote issued to
Annemarie with no associated payment, two invoices issued
to Janice Boldeman
where the duplicate invoice for $3,120 was not paid, an invoice to Lurice for
$10,555 and an invoice to Paul Yarrawarra
for $14,700 where there is no evidence
of payment, and an overpayment by Illawarra Tennis in the sum of $9,380. Mr
Croft included
the sum of $42,915 in the claimant’s total income for
calculating PAWE for the relevant period.
Croft reported FY23 receipts verified by the bank statements and confirmed with
quotes/invoices totals $75,704, which is $52,167
less than the income declared
by the claimant in his amended FY23 ITR.
Croft noted deposits totalling $4,415 but was unable to identify invoices or
other records to confirm the source of the deposits.
However, he assumed they
represented income received from the claimant’s personal exertion and
included that sum in the total
assumed income.
Text messages
Croft refers to the following screenshots of text messages sent by the claimant
to “Paul” as follows:
an undated text
message for a total of $5,760 (80 hours at $80 per hour);
a text message
sent 11 November 2022 for “van reno” showing hours worked, but no
dates, rates charged or total cost, and
a text message
sent on 1 December 2022 showing hours worked, but no dates, rates charged or
total cost.
Croft states he cannot rely on these messages where there are no details as to
the nature of the services, whether the hours were
worked in the relevant period
and where there is no related cash deposit shown in the claimant’s bank
statements.
Claimant’s schedule book
Croft states he cannot rely on the claimant’s schedule book for the
purpose of his calculations where the book does not:
show the name of
the client;
confirm the
dates the work was completed;
confirm who
completed the work;
show the nature
of the services provided (save for the entry 23 May); or
confirm the date
of payment.
Bunnings expenses
claimant has provided a list of Bunning expenses for FY22 to FY23 and for the
1 July 2023 to 20 February 2024. Mr Croft observes:
expenses are $6,593;
expenses are $12,511;
total expenses
in the relevant period are $8,016;
the claimant did
not provide a breakdown of FY22 other purchases and costs, so Mr Croft was
unable to verify the FY22 Bunnings expenses
to his ITR, and
FY23 Bunnings
expenses reconcile to the claimant’s original FY23
Calculation of PAWE
income of $47,330 comprised deposits received reconciled to invoices of $42,915
and deposits assumed to be personal exertion
income of $4,415.
Croft has calculated costs of sale as follows:
Expenses taken from the schedule of expenses prepared by the claimant;
equipment hire
equivalent to that declared in the claimant’s original FY23 ITR;
material costs, subcontractor expenses and tip fees as set out in the
claimant’s invoices, and
motor vehicle
expenses equal to 13% of total sales being the average motor vehicle expenses in
the claimant’s FY22 ITR and original
FY23 ITR, expressed as a percentage
of total income.
Croft concluded Bunnings expenses, equipment hire and motor vehicle expenses are
necessarily incurred by the claimant in deriving
his income and he has deducted
those costs from the total income.
relied on the expenses declared in the original FY23 ITR including electricity,
hat, insurances, internet, laundry, phone, PPE,
replacement tools, sunglasses,
sunscreen, and work boots/wet weather gear.
Croft reported the claimant’s PAWE was $334.01 calculated as follows:
business income
of $47,330; less
expenses of $29,961;
which equals
$17,369, and
taken over 52
weeks, the number of weeks in the 12 months before the
SUBMISSIONS
Claimant’s submissions
Submissions in response to internal review decision of 5 November
claimant provided
submissions in response to the internal review
decision dated
claimant attached to those submissions his FY23 NA and argued the Australian
Taxation Office had assessed his income at $131,871
without declaration of
expenses. On that basis it is submitted the claimant earnt the sum of $2,534.90
gross per week in FY23.
claimant submits in the period between 1 July 2023 to 21 February 2024 (31
weeks) his average income was $1,559.223 gross per
week. The claimant provided
bank statements and invoices for cash payments to verify his income in that
claimant submits that his PAWE should be calculated in accordance with these
Submissions dated 4 February 2025
claimant provided submissions dated 4 February
claimant submits that the earnings from his business was for the supply of his
labour with no significant investment or capital,
and therefore it is
appropriate to look at his gross income as disclosed in his tax returns.
claimant submits that any unsatisfactory features of his record keeping, or
business operations does not diminish the correlation
established between the
invoices and bank records, and the claimant’s evidence of a business
productive of a weekly income
greater than $334.01.
respect of the Procare reports, the claimant submits that in the case of a
non-evidence based jurisdiction the question of the
admissibility of expert
evidence will not be one of admissibility but of
further submits that rule 73 of the Personal Injury Commission Rules (PIC Rules)
involves discretionary factors including evaluating
whether the prejudice and
unfairness caused by reliance on the evidence is disproportionate to the
probative value. The claimant
submits the Procare reports are replete with
innuendo going to the claimant’s propriety in the conduct of the business
of operating on a cash basis, lodging of tax returns and compliance
with GST obligations.
claimant alleges Procare induced him to disclose information to which
confidentiality and legal privilege was attached. He alleges
that the use of
this material by Procare constitutes a denial of procedural fairness which
renders the Procare reports inadmissible.
claimant submits the conduct of Procare borders on an abuse of process
the claimant was
interrogated in the absence of legal representation where there was an obvious
at all times
during those interactions the claimant had been diagnosed with major depression
and was susceptible to exploitation;
in reporting
that the claimant had consulted a “tax lawyer about his PAWE”,
Procare failed to respect confidentiality
and legal privilege and used this
information in the preparation of a report;
volunteered accountancy advice to the claimant, when in a position of conflict
with the claimant;
in interrogating
the claimant Procare engaged in a breach of privacy and professional
obligations;
Procare gave
legal advice to the claimant when expressing the opinion that PAWE is based on
“gross earnings, being total income
less expenses” and when Procare
discussed the claimant’s interaction with his tax lawyer;
Procare, having
improperly procured confidential and privilege information from the claimant,
relied upon that advice stating it “leaves
us in a position questioning
the veracity and completeness of the supporting documents” and “in
particular given the
‘advice’ provided by his tax lawyer on to
maximise PAWE, whilst simultaneously creating a significant liability”,
the exchanges
between Procare and the claimant involved an obvious power inequality and a
prejudicial denial of procedural fairness
where the claimant was encouraged to
disclose information to which was attached confidential and legal privilege.
claimant submits that Procare’s impropriety was a factor in the opinion
expressed by Procare and that this was made clear
by the comment at paragraph 25
23 January 2025 report; “I do not consider the claimant’s
amended FY23 ITR to be an accurate record of his actual FY 23
income” and the conclusion that the claimant’s amended FY23 ITR
“is likely to be materially overstated”.
The author of the 2025
Procare report comments that the dominant purpose for requesting an amended FY
23 ITR has been to increase
PAWE calculation.
claimant submits that the Procare report should be excluded where the probative
value of the report is outweighed by the prejudicial
claimant submits he has acted in good faith where he has provided all his
financial records for scrutiny by Procare and where
he has utilised professional
tax advisers to prepare his returns, consistent with his obligations.
it is submitted that the “assumptions” to which the Procare authors
refer are in effect inferences drawn to establish
the assumption upon which the
author wishes to proceed. It is submitted this is demonstrated by excluding
income for which a receipt
is not identified to establish the income was earned.
Examples of inferences based on “assumptions” are at paragraph
and 26.4 “It does not appear to me...”, 27.2 “appears to be an
overpayment”, 27.1 “I assume those
deposits represent income”
and 31 “I assume”.
claimant submits it does not follow that the omission of an entry or record that
the transaction or fee was not generated or the
income earned should not lead to
the drawing of an inference adverse to the claimant.
Notwithstanding
the decision of a Merit Review Panel in
the claimant submits
the MAI Act is beneficial legislation and that fixed expenses should not be
deducted for the purposes of assessing
PAWE. The claimant contends that gross
earnings should be construed to mean revenue less the costs of

However, the
insurer submitted the same principles must apply to income that is overstated.
insurer submits the claimant would have incurred expenses in conducting his
business as a handyman, for example motor vehicle
expenses given he used his
vehicle to transport himself and his equipment from job to job.

from his business than he
insurer submits that the summary provided by the claimant in his submissions is
misleading. Firstly, the amended ITR has income
increasing from $103,503 to
$131,871 including previously undeclared additional cash income of $42,240 and
100% reduction in the
claim for business expenses. Secondly the total expenses
identified by the claim of $12,511 are only the expenses incurred at Bunnings
and do not take into account other expenses such as vehicle maintenance, repairs
and running costs, petrol, advertising, telephone,
internet, and other hardware
CONSIDERATION
response to a Direction from the Panel dated 8 August 2025 both parties agreed
the claimant’s PAWE should be determined in
accordance with Sch 1, cl 4(1)
of the MAI Act.
Panel finds that the relevant period is 20 February 2023 to 20 February 2024
being the period of 12 months immediately before
the day of the motor accident
per Sch 1, cl 4(1) of the MAI Act.
Accordingly,
in accordance with Sch 1, cl 4(1) of the MAI Act the Panel proposes to calculate
the PAWE based on a weekly average of
the gross earnings received between
February 2023 and 20 February 2024.
The amended Notice of Assessment
claimant submits that the Notice of Assessment issued by the Australian Taxation
Office is conclusive evidence of income.
177(1) of the
Income Tax Assessment Act
"The production of a notice of assessment, or of a
document under the hand of the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner, or a Deputy
Commissioner, purporting to be a copy of a notice of assessment, shall be
conclusive evidence of the due making of the assessment
and, except in
proceedings under
Administration Act 1953
on a review or appeal relating to the
assessment, that the amount and all the particulars of the assessment are

several authorities including
FJ Bloemen Pty Ltd v Commissioner of
where the High
Court referring to the
Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
"Section 177(1) specifically operates by compelling a court,
for example the Supreme Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction to
notice of assessment on its production as conclusive evidence that the
assessment has been duly made and thereby foreclosing
that issue."
Commissioner of Taxation v Futuris Corporation
the majority of the High
Court stated at [64]:
“The evident policy reflected in the
is the facilitation of proceedings for the recovery of tax which
are instituted by the Commissioner under s 209 of the
a court of competent jurisdiction. Corresponding provision is made elsewhere in
the recovery of other amounts. The action for recovery is facilitated by the

matters arising under the

considering the interpretation of Sch 1, cl 1(1) of the MAI Act Senior Member
Williams in

“I do not accept the claimant’s submission

Panel agrees with Senior Member Williams. The Panel finds that s 177(1) of the
is designed to facilitate the recovery of tax and the
“conclusive evidence” provision does not apply in other proceedings
not associated with the recovery of tax including the assessment of the
claimant’s PAWE in accordance with the MAI Act.
Panel finds the claimant’s Amended Notice of Assessment for the financial
year ending 2023 is not conclusive evidence of
the claimant’s earnings for
the purpose of calculating his PAWE in accordance with the MAI Act.
The admissibility of the Procare Report
Procare report of Paul Croft of Procare dated 23 January 2025 (the Procare
Report) was said to supersede two earlier reports dated
4 April 2024 and 23
September 2024.
Panel has considered the parties submissions as to the admissibility of the
Procare Report, noting in particular the claimant’s
submissions that the
report should be excluded where the probative value of the report is outweighed
by its prejudicial effect.
Direction PIC 4 mandates that an expert witness is not an advocate for the party
retaining them and is subject to an overriding
duty to assist the Commission on
the real issues in dispute. Breach of those obligations can result in the report
being inadmissible,
however r 35(3) of the PIC Rules gives the Commission a
discretion to admit the report.
the Commission is not constituted by Merit
the conduct of merit
review panel proceedings is governed by Procedural Direction MA6. Clause 27
provides the Panel is not bound
by the rules of evidence and cl 28 states the
review panel must be conducted in a way that best supports the objects of the
legislation and the
Personal Injury Commission Act 2020
(the PIC Act) . To that end, the Panel proposes to be guided by Procedural
Direction PIC 4 and r 35(3) of the PIC Rules.
Panel agrees the conduct of Procare was less than ideal and the author of the
Procare report has improperly relied upon information
gleaned in conversations
with the claimant to draw inferences adverse to him. However, the Panel concurs
with Merit Reviewer Medland
that the conclusions contained in the report were
based on the source documentation furnished by the claimant.
Panel proposes to admit the report into evidence but to disregard any gratuitous
comments made by the author of the report as
to the claimant’s intentions
in filing an amended 2023 income taxation return or as to the accuracy of that
Panel notes there has been very little assistance from the claimant in collating
and analysing the business records furnished
by him. The Panel finds it
necessary to have regard to the analysis in the Procare Report particularly
where the Panel is required
to calculate the claimant’s gross earnings for
the entire 12-month period immediately before the day on which the accident
occurred, including the period 1 July 2023 to 20 February 2024 which is a period
not covered by the income tax returns filed for
the 2023 financial year.
Panel proposes to admit the Procare Report into evidence but to disregard any
gratuitous comments made by the author of the report
as to the claimant’s
intentions in filing an amended income taxation return for the financial year
ending 2023 or as to the
accuracy of that return.
Calculation of
the pre-accident weekly earnings
response to a Direction from the Panel dated 8 August 2025, both parties agreed
the claimant’s PAWE should be determined
in accordance with sch 1, cl 4(1)
of the MAI Act.
the Panel found that loss of earnings in Sch 1, cl 3(b) relates to
the proceeds of any business resulting from the earners own personal
Therefore, the term gross earnings as it appears in Sch 1, cl 4 relates to the
gross earnings received by the earner after
the deduction of business expenses
but before the deduction of tax. The Panel agrees with the approach adopted by
the Review Panel
submissions dated 13 August 2025 counsel for the claimant submitted if the Panel
did not consider the claimant’s amended
income taxation return as
conclusive evidence of earnings, then the Panel should apply common law
principles of assessment of earning
capacity to determine the statutory payment.
The Panel does not agree this is appropriate. Schedule 1, cl 4(a) defines
pre-accident
weekly earnings as the weekly average of the gross earnings
received by the earner during the 12 months immediately before the day
the motor accident occurred. Other than the interpretation of the term
“gross earnings”, which was addressed
meaning of the text is clear
what is required is a calculation of the claimant’s actual earnings during
the relevant period.
on either the financial year 2023 Income Tax Return (FY23 ITR) or the amended
FY23 ITR does not assist the claimant in calculating
the gross earnings received
by the claimant as an earner during the 12 months immediately before the day on
which the motor accident
occurred, which the Panel finds is the period 20
February 2023 to
20 February 2024. Only part of that period is governed by
the FY23 ITR or the amended FY23 ITR. Accordingly, the Panel proposes to
regard to the source records in addition to the Procare report and the taxation
Panel notes that there is no evidence from the claimant to establish the
veracity of various records where doubt exists. The Panel
has attempted to
reconcile cash payments/bank deposits with invoices but is unable to do so
without evidence from the claimant.
a Review Panel Report and Directions dated 3 September 2025 the Panel stated as
“The following are
examples only of the difficulties the Panel has experienced in attempting to
reconcile the source documents:
(a) An invoice dated 5 January 2024 is near illegible and the Panel cannot
identify the name of the customer or the job. There is
a deposit of $1,500 on 9
January 2024 but the Panel is unable to determine if it relates to the 5 January
2024 invoice.
(b) An invoice from Yarrawarra is for the total sum of $14,700. This invoice
notes payments of $2,680 on 4 November 2023, $2,900
on 11 November 2023, $2,904
on 18 November 2023, $3,000 on 25 November 2023 and $3,480 on 1 December 2023.
The claimant or his solicitors
has included a notation on his November 2023 bank
statement which reads “income from cash $11,220”, and a notation on
his December 2023 bank statement which reads “earnings from cash
$3,480”. The Panel is unable to determine if the reported
cash earnings
are related to the Yarrawarra invoice, as the total amounts differ.
(c) There are payments shown on the bank statements from Teresa Findlay but no
invoices. It is not clear if these payments are earnings.
(d) There is a payment from Daniel MacPherson on 14 August 2023 for $88 but no
(e) There is a payment from AAI Limited on 14 August 2023 of $5,471.31. It is
not clear what this payment is for and whether it relates
to earnings.
(f) There is a payment from A Prince on 23 October 2023 for $100 and another on
9 December 2023 for $65 but no invoices. It is not
clear if these payments are
(g) There are payments from Janice Bolderman and Jans Kitchens which cannot be
reconciled with tax invoices. It is not clear if either
of these payments relate
to invoices issued to Jan, Jon and David, or Jan and John, or other invoice(s).
(h) There is a payment from Sally Dunn on 21 April 2023 of $1,520 but no
(i) There is a payment from Jarrod A Gaal on 23 May 2023 for $1,000 but no
(j) There is a payment from C A Garrard on 23 May 2023 for $3,181 and a further
payment from Cheryl A Garrard for $1,893 which appear
to align with quotes
issued by the claimant but no invoices.”
that Report the Panel made the following directions:
on or before
30 September 2025
the claimant is to provide evidence reconciling
invoices rendered with deposits and reported cash payments received for work
during the relevant period of 20 February 2023 to 20 February 2024
including but not limited to the examples outlined in paragraph
submissions dated 10 June 2025 the claimant conceded there should be a deduction
for business expenses in the sum of $12,511.
On or before
30 September
the claimant is directed to provide a breakdown of the expenses

Bank accounts for the claimant for the period 1
February 2023 until 29 February
2024, and a schedule marked Annexure B said to identify the payments received
and banked by the claimant
during the relevant period totalling $59,813.12. A
further schedule marked Annexure C was provided purporting to list cash payments
received by the claimant during the relevant period totalling $28,250. A third
schedule marked Annexure D purported to provide a
list of business expenses
totalling $9,188.81.
submissions dated 29 September 2025 the claimant submitted the claimant’s
gross income for the relevant period is as follows:
Gross Income
Business Expenses $ 8,742.43
Income for Relevant Period $72,320.69 /52 weeks
Weekly Income for PAWE Calculation $1,525.39 gross per week.
response to the Panel’s directions the insurer provided submissions dated
15 October 2025. The insurer noted there had been no additional evidence

and not as a Merit Reviewer.
Whether the decision by Member Medland under s 8.10(4)(b) was within the scope
of the dispute referred
to Merit Reviewer Medland is not a matter which this
Panel can determine. As stated, a Merit Review Panel can only review a merit

decision of Member Medland as to costs is not amenable to review by the Review
Panel and the Review Panel has no power to determine
an application for legal
costs on the basis of “exceptional circumstances” under s 8.10(4)(b)

PANEL DETERMINATION
Panel revokes the decision of Merit Reviewer Medland dated 14 May 2025.
Panel determines for the purposes of Sch 1, cl 4(1) of the MAI Act, the
