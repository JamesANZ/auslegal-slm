Karen Leann Jorgensen-Hall v Workcover Corporation (Australian Poultry Ltd - Steggles Ltd) [1999] SAWCAT 3 (23 March 1999)
WORKERS COMPENSATION APPEAL TRIBUNAL
Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, 1986
In the matter of an appeal by
KAREN LEANN JORGENSEN-HALL
worker, against a determination of a
REVIEW OFFICER
dated the 31st day
of December, 1996, which also concerns
WORKCOVER CORPORATION (AUSTRALIAN
POULTRY LTD. - STEGGLES LTD.)
the employer.
(No. 10W of 1997)
His Honour Acting Deputy President G.M. Thompson
REASONS FOR DECISION
PUBLISHED THE 23RD
DAY OF MARCH
Application by Corporation for this matter to be heard at same time as two
Workers Compensation Tribunal matters between the same
parties arising from the
same facts with the same employment - Directions re application of
- Calling evidence from medical witnesses who had supplied written
reports to Review Panel.
Cases Cited:
Jorgensen-Hall v. WorkCover
(unreported Supreme Court S.6459).
Appearances:
M.W. Saies for the Worker/Appellant.
M.A. Crawley for the Corporation/Respondent.
By Application for Directions the Corporation has applied for an order that
appeal number 10W/1997 in the Workers Compensation Appeal
Tribunal be heard at
the same time as Judicial Determinations 1317/96 and 1272/97 pending in the
Workers Compensation Tribunal.
WCT 1317/96 deals with a claim for
WCT 1272/97 deals with a claim for
entitlements.
The Judicial Determinations are set down for three days commencing 4 May
Broadly speaking the WCAT matter deals with the issues of disability.
All the matters arise from incidents that occurred in the first half of 1992.
The issue of disability after 1992 was dealt with
by a Review Officer and a
determination made on 31 December 1996. (There had been a prior decision of a
Review Officer point adverse
to the worker on a Section 102 point - which was
the subject of an unsuccessful appeal to the WCAT A.4/1996.)
In this matter the worker lodged an appeal to the WCAT from the determination
of 31 December 1996. That appeal was dismissed by
me on 24 March 1997 in
From that the worker appealed to the Full Court of the Supreme Court. The
appeal was allowed in part in respect of the contention
that the Tribunal had
wrongly failed to hear medical evidence which the worker sought to adduce
pursuant to
Section 97(4e)(b)
of the Act as it then stood.
In judgment S.6459 of 1 December 1997 the Full Supreme Court returned the
matter to Tribunal.
By letter 4 May 1998 the Worker's Solicitors wrote to the Tribunal requesting
the matter be relisted for hearing.
While the above was in progress the worker filed a notice of dispute in respect
of a claim for
expenses. (WCT 1317/96).
That matter proceeded to arbitration. On 16 November 1998 Acting Judge
Gilchrist ordered that the matter proceed to judicial determination.
On 5 March 1997 the worker filed a notice of dispute in respect of the
compensating authority's decision that the worker's
entitlements
were nil. (WCT 1272/97).
That matter also proceeded to arbitration.
In November 1997, Acting Judge Gilchrist ordered that that matter also proceed
to judicial determination.
Hence there are three sets of proceedings in two jurisdictions with a common
factual basis which emanates from January 1992.
The Respondent applies for an order that the evidence in all matters be heard
at the same time - and that the evidence in one should
be treated as the
evidence in all cases.
Counsel for the worker Appellant opposes this scenario. It is submitted that if
the worker does not give evidence (in the WCAT)
(and a successful application
pursuant to
Section 97(4d)
would have to be made in order for the worker to
give evidence) the Deputy President hearing the matter might be confronted with
the worker giving evidence in the
matters within WCT
but not in the disability
(Section 35)
matter. The credibility of the
worker/appellant may be an issue in the WCT. The view taken of credibility in
the WCT matters, might
influence the view taken of credibility in the WCAT
matter. This is said to be undesirable.
A further ground for opposition (and perhaps a development of the first ground)
is that the Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal
and the Workers Compensation
Tribunal are different processes with different routes of appeal. Therefore it
is inappropriate for
both matters to be heard together.
Of course it was common, and indeed the usual course under the Review system
that these matters
(Sections 35
) would be heard by one judicial
Indeed, the usual course now is that the same issues are heard by the one
judicial officer in the WCT.
The judicial officer hearing this matter presides over appeals in the Appeal
Tribunal WCAT and from time to time presides over Judicial
Determinations
I bear in mind the history of this matter and the immense costs thereof thus
far incurred. It seems to me that there is an extremely
powerful argument for
attempting to dispose of all outstanding matters between the parties as
quickly, expeditiously and cheaply
as possible. The way to do that is to hear
all matters at the same time or one following the other.
I reject the first submission. Firstly I take a robust view of my capacity to
exclude from consideration in the WCAT matter, material
that is only germane to
the WCT matters.
Secondly, it is unlikely with the present state of the lists that the WCAT
matter would be listed until mid August 1999. That is
twenty one months after
the Supreme Court decision was published - two and a half years since the WCAT
decision A.28/1997. - three
years and eight months from the Review Officer's
determination the subject of this appeal - and as the Appellant last worked for
the Respondent in July 1992 - some seven years after the parties severed the
work relationship.
Finally it would be quite undesirable for different Judicial Officer to hear
the cases. In that event there is a real possibility
of a conflict of findings
As to the second submission - I do not perceive the alleged undesirability. The
appeal rights of both parties would be unaffected.
The Appellant proposes to
call six doctors in the WCAT matter (pursuant to
Section 97(4e)b
see hereunder
- the same six doctors are presumably to be called in the WCT matters. I reject
the second submission.
I order that the Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal matter 10W/1997 be heard
at the same time as the WCT matters 1317/1996 and
The second matter that falls for consideration is the application
to call evidence from Drs. Ormandy,
Blight, Cullum, Guirgis, Spitzo and Cassar.
I am informed that reports by each of those medical practitioners were in
evidence before the Review Officer.
It is clear from the Full Court's decision in
Jorgensen-Hall
the Appellant has the right to call those doctors pursuant to
Section 97(4e)(b).
I am told from the bar table that the evidence sought
to be adduced will be supported by medical reports where the examinations
- or the reports were generated either after the conclusion of the
review hearing, or after the review proceedings.
In order that the Respondent be not taken by surprise at the hearing, thus
generating an application for an adjournment - I order
pursuant to Rule
12(2)(f) of the Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal Rules 1988 that by the 1st
April 1999, the Appellant's solicitors
provide the Respondent's solicitors with
a copy of all medical reports upon which the Appellant proposes to rely on the
this appeal including those that were before the Review Officer.
To the extent that it might be thought that Rule 12(2)(f) will not support such
an order, then pursuant to Rule 27 of the said rules
I direct that the
procedure to be followed is that mandated by Supreme Court Rule 61.06 -
mutalis mutandis
in accordance with my order.
The final application in this matter is from the Respondent that leave should
be given to it to call Mr. E.T. Eriksen to give evidence
on the appeal. This
was as I understand not opposed by Mr.
and I make that order
pursuant to Section 97(4d).
In summary I make the following orders:-
1. That Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal matter 10W/97 be heard at the
same time as the Workers Compensation Tribunal matters
1317/96 and 1272/97.
2. That the Appellant have liberty to call Drs. Ormandy - Guirguis, Blight,
Callum, Spitzo and Cassar.
3. Pursuant to Rule 12(2)(f) of this WCAT rules I order that by 1st April 1999
the Appellant's solicitors and the Respondent's
solicitors supply each other
with a copy of all medical reports upon which they propose to rely - including
those that were before
the Review Officer.
4. Pursuant to Rule 12/4/a I order both parties to provide to the Tribunal and
to each other the names of witnesses to be called.
5. Pursuant to Section 97(4d) - of the Act I give leave to the Respondent to
call Mr. Eriksen to give evidence.
6. I order the Appellant to file a supplementary appeal book containing all
medical reports - and any other written evidence -
on which the Appellant and
Respondent propose to rely on the hearing of the appeal. This is to be done by
April 15th 1999.
Liberty to apply.
