matter is remitted for re-determination by a different Arbitrator, in accordance
with the Court of Appeal decision in
Theoret v Aces Incorporated
which identified the errors into which the original Arbitrator and
Presidential member had fallen.
INTRODUCTION
matter comes before the Commission pursuant to an order for remitter made by the
Court of Appeal in
Theoret v Aces
Incorporated
claim is brought by Patricia Theoret against her employer Aces Incorporated.
Ms Theoret suffered injuries at different times
during the same employment
with Aces Incorporated. Ms Theoret first became entitled to weekly compensation
of workers compensation
in 2004. This was when she first became entitled to
receive weekly compensation. Ms Theoret continued to receive weekly payments
until September 2017. In 2018, the insurer carried out a work capacity
assessment and as a result of that assessment, Ms Theoret
continued to be
entitled to receive weekly payments of workers compensation.
3 April 2019, the insurer gave notice under s 78 of the
Workplace Injury
Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998
(the 1998 Act) advising Ms
Theoret that she was assessed as having no work capacity. This notice also
advised Ms Theoret of the insurer’s
determination of her pre-injury
average weekly earning entitlement (indexed PIAWE) under s 43(1)(d) of the
Workers Compensation Act 1987
(the 1987 Act).
24 July 2019, Ms Theoret’s lawyers sought a review of the s 78 decision
arguing that the PIAWE calculation should be indexed
from the date she first
received weekly compensation. This matter involved the construction of s 82A of
the 1987 Act, which commenced
on 1 October 2012.
proceedings were determined initially by the Arbitrator on 6 November 2019, who
concluded that the indexation of her weekly payments
applied from the first
review date after 1 October 2012. An appeal to a Presidential member was
determined on 25 March 2020 in a
decision which confirmed the decision of the
Arbitrator.
Theoret appealed the decision of the Presidential member to the Court of appeal.
THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
Court of Appeal decision is dated 2 February 2021. McCallum JA said as
“The critical question is whether, properly
construed, s 82A provides for historical indexation, as contended by the
or only prospective indexation (that is, indexation that commences
only after the commencement of s 82A), as contended by the respondent.
have concluded that the appellant’s construction is correct, for the
following reasons.
The appellant referred to the well-known principles of statutory construction
stated in the decision of the High Court in
Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian
Broadcasting Authority
(1998) 194 CLR 355
[1998] HCA 28
relied in particular on the principle stated at [70]:
‘Reconciling conflicting provisions will often require the court ‘to
determine which is the leading provision and which
the subordinate provision,
and which must give way to the other’. Only by determining the hierarchy
of the provisions will
it be possible in many cases to give each provision the
meaning which best gives effect to its purpose and language while maintaining
the unity of the statutory scheme.’ (citations omitted)
appellant submitted that, prior to the 2012 amendments, the method of
calculating weekly payments ensured that ‘currency
was maintained’
because a worker’s benefit was calculated by reference to probable
earnings if uninjured, determined
from time to time by reference to updated
evidence as to what the worker would have been earning had their employment
Whether or not currency was ensured by that method, it certainly
offered some safeguard against inflation. As already explained,
respondent’s construction of s 82A would offer no such safeguard
because, in a case such as the present, it would determine
future entitlements
by reference to a historical wage frozen for a period without indexation.
Be that as it may, the inquiry as to which construction is to be preferred
must begin with a consideration of the statutory text.
The appellant identified
s 82A(1) as the ‘leading provision’ (invoking the principle
Project Blue Sky
at [70]) and submitted that s 82A(4) is
subordinate to that provision, being merely mechanical or procedural. The text
of s 82A(1)
supports that analysis: the amount of a weekly payment
‘is to be varied on each review date after the day on which the worker
became entitled to weekly payments in respect of that injury’. Subsection
82A(1) is capable of having effect on its own terms.
As noted by the appellant,
the number to be declared by the Authority in accordance with subs 82A(4)
is determined in accordance
with the expression set out in subs 82A(1).
There is no element of discretion or the exercise of any judgment or choice on
of the Authority in declaring the relevant
Garling, agreeing with the judgment of McCallum JA, stated as
“As the relevant date for s 82A is not always
the date of injury, although in many cases it may well be because there is an
incapacity immediately consequent upon the injury, a factual determination needs
to be made of the relevant date so as to enable
the correct application of the
indexation calculation in s 82A.
In this appeal, the issue of the relevant date has real and significant
consequences to the indexation calculation. If incapacity
is established at the
time immediately following the subject injury, then the first review date for
the purposes of s 82A will be
1 April 2003.
If an incapacity is established by the payments of compensation made for the
period commencing 24 May 2004 because they relate to
the subject injury and not
to the third injury, then the first review date will be 1 October 2004.
Alternatively, if the relevant
incapacity of the appellant is only established
by reference to the payments of compensation commencing on 13 December 2013,
the first review date will be 1 April 2014.
The determination of the relevant date for the purposes of the application of
s 82A will be a matter for proof when the proceedings
are determined by the
Workers Compensation Commission as required by the orders disposing of this
JA also noted that it was:
“necessary in order to apply the
indexation required by s 82A to determine when for the purposes of that
section Ms Theoret
became entitled to weekly payments in respect of the injury
occasioned by her assault in 2002, that being a question of fact which
arise for determination on the approach taken by the Arbitrator and the Deputy
President.”
orders of the Court of Appeal were:
“1. Allow the appeal.
