REASONS FOR DECISION:
21 November 2024, Sam Weston (the ‘Applicant’) referred a Code of
Conduct complaint (the ‘Complaint’) to
the Local Government
Association of the Northern Territory under
section 124(3)(a)
Government Act 2019
(‘LGA’). The Applicant is a City of Darwin
Councillor. In the Complaint, the Applicant alleged that another City of Darwin
Councillor, Amye Un (the ‘First Respondent’) had breached clauses 1,
2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Code
of Conduct set out in Schedule 1 of the
prescribed corporation panel (the ‘Panel”) was established under
section 127(2) of the LGA to consider the Complaint. The three members
of the Panel were the Second, Third and Fourth Respondents.
a decision dated 18 February 2025, the Panel concluded that the First Respondent
had not contravened clauses 1, 2 and 4 of the
Code of Conduct. The Panel found,
however, that the First Respondent had breached clauses 3, 5 and 6. The Panel
reprimanded the First
Respondent for her conduct in accordance with section
127(5)(b)(i) of the LGA. The Panel also recommended that,
Department of Housing, Local Government and Community Development mandate the
Respondent undertake further training within 3 months
of the date of this
decision in accordance with section 127(5)(b)(ii) of the [LGA], particularly on
the Code of Conduct and appropriate
use of social media, in order for her to
properly understand her responsibilities of being a member of council under the
First Respondent completed the training recommended by the Panel. As evidenced
by a Certificate of Completion issued by the Northern
Territory Government dated
16 April 2025, the scope of the training provided to the First Respondent
included the roles and responsibilities
of Council Members, the Code of Conduct
and the personal use of social media.
to an Initiating Application dated 18 March 2025, the Applicant sought pursuant
to section 327 of the LGA a review of the
Panel’s findings that the First
Respondent did not contravene clauses 2 and 4 of the Code of Conduct. No
challenge was made
to the Panel’s findings in relation to clauses 1, 3, 5
Panel’s findings in relation to clauses 2 and 4 of
the Code of Conduct
alleged breaches of clauses 2 and 4 of the Code of Conduct arose from posts made
by the First Respondent and others on the First
Respondent’s Facebook
page. Clause 2 of the Code of Conduct provides: “A member must act with
reasonable care and diligence
in performing official functions”. Clause 4
provides: “A member must not bully another person in the course of
official functions”.
Panel found that, to fall within clauses 2 and 4 of the Code of
there must be a nexus between the alleged contravention and
the “performance of official functions” in order to make out
breaches of clauses 2 and 4. If the Respondent was not performing official
functions when making the Facebook posts, then
breaches of clauses 2 and
4 are not made out.
reviewed the First Respondent’s Facebook page, the Panel
that the Facebook profile “does not appear to assert that it is
official page as a member of Council or provide her title as Councillor Un,
member of City of Darwin
The Panel found,
therefore, that the Applicant had not established the nexus between the posts on
the First Respondent’s Facebook
page and her performance of her official
functions as a City of Darwin Councillor.
Applicant’s
submissions
Applicant submits that the Panel erred in concluding that no nexus was
established between the posts on the First Respondent’s
Facebook page and
her performance of her official functions as a City of Darwin Councillor.
Secondly, the Applicant maintains that
the Panel failed to inform him that the
nexus between the First Respondent’s Facebook posts and the performance of
her official
functions was in issue. Consequently, the Applicant maintains that
he did not have an opportunity to respond which was a denial of
fairness on the part of the Panel.
the question of nexus, the Applicant notes the following:
10.1. the First
Respondent’s profile biography clearly identifies the First Respondent as
a City of Darwin Councillor;
10.2. the First
Respondent appears in an official City of Darwin uniform in a number of pictures
posted to her Facebook page.
the question of the alleged denial of procedural fairness, the Applicant
maintains that he “was entitled to be notified of
any significant issue
the Panel intended to rely upon, particularly one that became the basis for
dismissing a
complaint”.
Respondent’s submissions
submissions filed by the First Respondent did not address the issues relevant to
this review. The First Respondent noted that
she had completed the required
training recommended by the Panel and takes issue with the Applicant’s
assertion that the Panel’s
findings in relation to clauses 2 and 4 of the
Code of Conduct were in error.

section 46(1)
Northern Territory Civil and Administrative Tribunal
“Preferable” is apt to refer to a decision
which involves discretionary considerations. A “correct” decision,
in the context of review, might be taken to be one rightly made. It is,
inevitably, a decision by the original decision-maker with
which the Tribunal
Consideration
Applicant correctly asserts that the First Respondent’s Facebook profile
notes that the First Respondent is a “Councillor
Darwin City
Council”. The profile page also states that the First Respondent is a
“Business Owner at Laksa House Darwin”
and notes where she went to
high school, the city in which she lives and her relationship status. In her
profile picture, the First
Respondent is not in her Darwin City Council
constitute the performance of official functions within the meaning of clauses 2
and 4 of the Code of Conduct, such functions must
be identified with some degree
of precision.
That reference is
made in the First Respondent’s Facebook profile, or in some posts, to her
position as a City of Darwin Councillor
does not transform what is clearly a
personal Facebook account into an official Facebook page for her role as a City
of Darwin Councillor.
The mere fact that the person setting up a Facebook page
holds the position of a City of Darwin Councillor and is identified on the
Facebook page as holding such position, cannot convert private acts carried out
by the person into the performance of official functions.
The Panel was correct
to conclude that the First Respondent was not performing official functions when
making the impugned posts.
Denial of procedural fairness
establish a denial of procedural fairness, the onus is on the Applicant
prove that, through the actions of the Panel, an opportunity to advance
case has been lost.
Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Lam
at [37], Gleeson CJ stated that “[w]hether one talks in terms of
procedural fairness of natural justice, the concern is
to avoid practical
injustice”.
is not at all clear from the evidence adduced and submissions made by the
Applicant precisely how the Applicant, in the proceedings
before the Panel, lost
an opportunity to advance his case. The Applicant was aware of the wording of
clauses 2 and 4 of the Code
of Conduct. He was aware that, unlike clauses 3, 5
and 6 relied on by him in making the Complaint, clauses 2 and 4 stipulated that,
to apply, the First Respondent had to be performing official functions. Finally,
the Applicant was aware that the First Respondent
was contesting the assertion
that she had breached clauses 2 and 4.
Panel had to consider whether the impugned Facebook posts of the First
Respondent were made in the performance of the First Respondent’s
functions. The Panel’s need to consider this issue was not something that
should have taken the Applicant by surprise.
It is an issue that arose clearly
from the text of the Code of Conduct. There was no denial of procedural fairness
by the Panel.
Panel came to the correct decision in relation to clauses 2 and 4 of the Code of
Conduct. The decision of the Panel is
general rule in Tribunal proceedings is that parties are to bear their own
Pursuant to section
132(1) and, in the case of review proceedings, section 133, the Tribunal retains
a discretion to make an award
of costs based on the considerations enumerated in
those sections. Neither the Applicant nor the First Respondent indicated that
they wished to be heard on the questions of costs. Consequently, the general
section 131
Northern Territory Civil and Administrative
Tribunal Act 2014
should apply.
Accordingly, the Tribunal
orders that:
decision of the prescribed corporation in the Code of Conduct Complaint brought
by Sam Weston against Amye Un dated 18 February
2025 is confirmed.
parties are to bear their own costs.
