INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
factual background is uncontroversial. Linda Merritt (the worker) suffered a
series of injuries from 1990 to 1994, whilst in the
course of her employment
with Lachley Meats (the employer) working as a labourer at the Forbes Abattoir.
She was described as having
a deemed date of injury of 10 January
She ceased working there in
1998 and has not worked since.
was paid compensation on a voluntary basis.
general terms,
Workers Compensation Act 1987
Act), as amended by the
Workers Compensation Legislation Amendment Act
(the 2012 Amending Act), limits weekly payments of compensation to an
aggregate period of 260 weeks. Clause 13 of Div 2 of Sch 6
to the 1987 Act
provides that the application of s 39 is to have no regard to periods of
compensation paid prior to commencement
of the 2012 Amending Act. The
respondent’s insurer ceased paying the worker weekly benefits on
25 December 2017, at the expiration
of 260 weeks of relevant payments.
Section 39(2) provides that the section does not apply to a worker whose injury
results in permanent
impairment of more than 20 per cent.
worker was assessed by Dr Anderson, an Approved Medical Specialist (AMS) who in
a medical assessment certificate (MAC) dated 1
November 2018 certified that she
suffered whole person impairment (WPI) of 24 per
The employer’s insurer
recommenced the payment of weekly payments from 1 November 2018. At issue in the
current proceedings
is the weekly entitlement from 26 December 2017 to 1
November 2018. There is an issue regarding whether, in the case of such an
worker, who is ultimately certified as having WPI of more than 20 per
cent, there is a weekly entitlement during periods before the
certification
occurs. The matter was heard initially by Arbitrator Sweeney on 2 April 2019. He
delivered an ex tempore decision in
which he made a weekly award at the rate of
$814 per week as adjusted from 26 December 2017 to 1 November 2018.
decision was appealed by the employer pursuant to
Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998
(the 1998 Act). There
was an oral hearing before the President Phillips DCJ. The State Insurance
Regulatory Authority (the Authority)
also appeared through counsel at the
hearing, it having intervened pursuant to s 106 of the 1998 Act. The
issue, in similar terms,
had previously been the subject of Presidential
decisions in
RSM Building Services Pty Ltd v
Technical and
Further Education Commission trading as TAFE NSW v
Honour issued a decision on 12 September
His Honour followed his
earlier decisions in
Hochbaum No. 1
, upheld the
appeal, and an award in favour of the employer, on the closed period, was
substituted for the award made by the Arbitrator.
LEGISLATION
39 of the 1987 Act provides:
39 Cessation of weekly
payments after 5 years
(1) Despite any other provision of this Division, a worker has no
entitlement to weekly payments of compensation under this Division
in respect of
an injury after an aggregate period of 260 weeks (whether or not consecutive) in
respect of which a weekly payment
has been paid or is payable to the worker in
respect of the injury.
(2) This section does not apply to an injured worker whose injury
results in permanent impairment if the degree of permanent impairment
from the injury is more than 20%.
For workers with more than 20% permanent impairment,
entitlement to compensation may continue after 260 weeks but entitlement after
260 weeks is still subject to section 38.
(3) For the purposes of this section, the degree of permanent
impairment that results from an injury is to be assessed as provided
65 (for an assessment for the purposes of Division 4).”
350(3) of the 1998 Act provides:
“(3) The Commission may
reconsider any matter that has been dealt with by the Commission and rescind,
alter or amend any decision
previously made or given by the
Commission.”
THE COURT OF APPEAL DECISION IN
Presidential decision in
was appealed to the Court of Appeal,
which delivered a decision upholding the appeal on 17 June
“... on the proper construction of s 39, the 260-week
limit never applies to a worker whose degree of permanent impairment resulting
from the relevant injury exceeds 20%, regardless of when that threshold is
crossed, and regardless of whether or when it is formally
assessed as having
been crossed.”
THE RECONSIDERATION APPLICATION
5 November 2020 the worker’s solicitor wrote to the Registrar, seeking a
reconsideration pursuant to s 350(3) of the 1998
Act of the Presidential
decision dated 12 September 2019. The letter submits that the Presidential
decision in the current matter
cannot stand in the light of the decision in
Hochbaum No. 2
. It is submitted that the decision of the Arbitrator
should be reinstated. The worker submits that reconsideration provides a just,
quick and cheap outcome, now that the Court of Appeal has clarified the legal
principles to be applied.
employer’s solicitors responded in an email dated 8 November 2020. The
employer advised that it will not be filing submissions
in response to the
application.
ON THE PAPERS
354(6) of the 1998 Act provides:
“(6) If the Commission
is satisfied that sufficient information has been supplied to it in connection
with proceedings, the
Commission may exercise functions under this Act without
holding any conference or formal hearing.”
party submits that an oral hearing is appropriate. Having regard to Practice
Directions Nos 1 and 6 and the documents that
are before me, I am satisfied that
I have sufficient information to proceed ‘on the papers’ without
holding any conference
or formal hearing and that this is the appropriate course
in the circumstances.
THRESHOLD MATTERS
is no dispute between the parties that the threshold requirements as to quantum
and time pursuant to ss 352(3) and 352(4) of
the 1998 Act have been met.
principles that govern exercise of the discretion pursuant to s 350(3) of the
1998 Act were reviewed by Roche ADP in
Samuel v Sebel Furniture
in a passage that has
been repeatedly applied in such applications in the Commission. The discretion
is a wide one, although there
is a public interest that litigation should not
proceed indefinitely. I have previously applied these principles in
reconsidering
a Presidential decision in circumstances where, shortly after the
decision was issued, a subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal
dealing with the construction and interpretation of the relevant provisions of
the workers compensation legislation, and
a regulation was promulgated which
clarified the relevant law (dealing with common law
accept that the reasoning and conclusions of the Court of Appeal in
are inconsistent with the Presidential decision in the current matter.
I accept that it is appropriate to exercise the reconsideration
power in the
circumstances to do justice between the parties. The worker submits that the
decision of the Arbitrator should be reinstated.
I note that the employer, quite
properly, does not make submissions contrary to that course.
note that the employer’s identity was described in the Certificate of
Determination dated 2 April 2019, issued by the Arbitrator,
in a fashion
consistent with what appears in the Presidential decision dated 12 April 2019
(and in this decision). I note the employer
was described in the Application to
Appeal and the Notice of Opposition as the ‘Workers Compensation Nominal
It was suggested by the employer’s counsel at the hearing
of the appeal that the correct identity may well be the ‘Workers
Compensation Nominal
There appears to
have been some uncertainty. I note the Arbitrator gave the parties liberty to
apply in respect of the calculations
regarding the weekly entitlement from
26 December 2017 to 1 November 2018. It is, in my view, appropriate to
grant liberty for the
parties to apply to the Arbitrator in respect of both of
these matters, should it prove necessary.
the exercise of its discretion pursuant to s 350(3) of the 1998 Act the
Commission orders:
Orders made in the Determination of Appeal Against a Decision of the Commission
Constituted by an Arbitrator dated 12 September
2019 are revoked.
Orders in the Certificate of Determination – Ex Tempore Orders dated 2
April 2019 are confirmed. Additionally, a further
Order is added to those
“4. Liberty to apply to the Arbitrator
in respect of the description of the respondent’s identity.”
