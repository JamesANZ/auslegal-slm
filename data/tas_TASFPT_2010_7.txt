V L Walker v Forest Practices Authority [2010] TASFPT 7 (21 July 2010)
File No: 4/10 F D07/2010
VL Walker Appellant
Forest Practices Authority Respondent
This was the hearing of an appeal against a refusal to approve a Forest
Practices Plan number RSS0009 at Castle Forbes Bay.
The appeal was heard
at Hobart on the 15 July 2010.
Ms A Chuter and Dr P Bell appeared
on behalf of the Forest Practices Authority.
Mr R Smith and Mr V Walker
appeared on behalf of the Appellant.
Practices Plan RSS0009 (the ‘FPP’) was for clearfelling of 10 ha of
Eucalyptus globulus
(blue gum) forest and conversion to hardwood
plantation at Castle Forbes Bay. The vegetation is dominated by
Eucalyptus globulus
and is attributed to the TASVEG community wet
forest and is subsumed into the RFA community
Forest Practices Authority (the ‘FPA’) recommended refusal of the
FPP. The grounds of the refusal were: first, the
presence of significant
habitat for the White bellied Sea Eagle; and secondly, the presence of
significant habitat for the Swift
appeal contested each of those grounds.
evidence on behalf of the FPA was that it relied upon management tools
constituted by the Threatened Fauna Advisor (the ‘TFA’),
FPA Planning Guideline 2008/1.
The TFA is an expert decision support
system for threatened species in forestry situations. It is applied pursuant to
Section D3.3
of the Forest Practices Code, which requires that Forest Practices
Officers (‘FPO’) in determining the management of
threatened species
in wood production areas,
consult the TFA.
The White-Bellied Sea Eagle.
species is listed as Vulnerable, under the
Tasmanian Threatened Species
Protection Act 1995
endorsed management prescription is comprised by Recommendation 3 of the TFA,
which requires that all known nests of the White-bellied
Sea Eagle be
surrounded with an undisturbed reserve of at least 10 ha (a circle with a
diameter of 360 m). To avoid nest desertion,
no forestry activities, (including
roading, harvesting, burning and other activities such as cutting, loading,
boundary making, planting,
1080 baiting, etc) should be carried out within
500 m of the nest, or within 1 km of, of line of sight of the
the evidence, and it was uncontested, there are two White bellied Sea Eagle
nests located approximately 65 and 85m respectively
south of the FPP boundary.
Both nests have a recorded history of recent use, and it is likely they are
utilised by the same breeding
pair. Either nest is used each year for breeding,
and has resulted in successful breeding and fledging of chicks.
nominal nest reserve of 10 ha, or 180m radius, would extend into the proposed
FPP area. It is, on the evidence for the FPA, inappropriate
to change the shape
of the nest reserve because the nests are downhill of the FPP and the Eagle
therefore more readily disturbed.
In order to comply with the recommendation,
the minimum 180m radius from the nest point should be applied and activity
within 500m
and a one kilometre line of sight, should be restricted during the
breeding season, subject to a nest activity check.
evidence was further that the FPP area also supports significant habitat for the
White-bellied Sea Eagle as defined under the
FPA Planning Guideline
. Under that Guideline, habitat for the White-bellied Sea Eagle is
defined as, all native forest and native non-forest within 500
m or a 1 km line
of sight of a White-bellied Sea Eagle nest known to be active in the last
30 years. The FPP area is comprised of
native forest and is within both
those distances. The FPP area is therefore significant White-bellied Sea Eagle
habitat and should
be maintained and not converted to hardwood plantation, under
FPA Planning Guideline 2008/1
evidence on behalf of the Appellant was that there are approximately
290 White-bellied Sea Eagle nests in Tasmania, and that accordingly
nests close to the proposed nest site represented only 0.67% of the known nests.
It was contended accordingly that the refusal
to certify the FPP was
disproportionate to the supposed threat and would not increase the risk of
endangering the White bellied Sea
Eagle. The answering evidence on behalf of
the FPA was, that given the low numbers of active nests and the relatively low
of successful breeding pairs, interference with the two subject nests
would be a significant threat to the species.
all of the evidence into account, the Tribunal is satisfied that the two
White-bellied Sea Eagle nests should be protected
by the recommended
180 m radius circle and 1 km line of sight forestry limitation, and
that accordingly the refusal appealed against
was in this respect,
The Swift Parrot
evidence for the FPA, and it was uncontested, was that this species is listed as
Endangered under both the Tasmanian
Threatened Species Protection Act
1995, and the Commonwealth
Environment Protection and Biodiversity
Conservation Act 1999
breeding habitat of the species is, on the evidence, comprised of two essential
elements, foraging trees and nest trees. Foraging
habitat includes all
Eucalyptus ovata
Eucalyptus globulus
dominated woodlands and
forests, where
Eucalyptus globulus
is a greater than 10% component of the
canopy. Most nests occur in hollow-bearing trees, with a significant size, dead
branches in
the crown and visible potential hollows. They are generally less
than 9 km from foraging habitat with current flowering.
percentage cover of
Eucalyptus globulus
in the subject FPP area is
greater than 50%, and therefore is all considered to be significant foraging
habitat for the Swift Parrot
and should not be cleared and converted to another
land use. In addition, the FPP area contains potential Swift Parrot nesting
The evidence for the FPA was that the presence of any potential nesting
habitat increases the value of the forest type as Swift
was contended on behalf of the Appellant that, as in the case of the
White-bellied Sea Eagle , the conversion of the 10 ha of the
FPP to plantation
would not cause a serious or irreversible threat and would not increase the risk
of endangering the Swift Parrot
habitat. It was contended that instead of a
refusal which would constitute a zero risk approach, the use of adaptive
techniques would avoid endangering the relevant habitat. It was,
however, conceded that as it was proposed to completely clear that
forest cover, it would not be possible to retain individual trees which were
potential habitat, within the FPP area. The
Tribunal accordingly sees little
room for the use of adaptive management techniques in the present
was also contended that wholly refusing to certify the FPP was otherwise
inappropriate to the perceived risk. That was again on
the basis that the
proposed conversion of the 10 ha would not cause a serious or irreversible
threat and would not increase the risk
of endangering either of the threatened
species. The Tribunal considers that the same reasoning, as above, is also
applicable to
this contention.
The financial effect of the Tribunal's determination.
section 37(13) of the
Forest Practices Act 1985
the Tribunal is to take
into account the financial effect of its determination on the parties to the
appeal. The relevant financial
effect which will, on the evidence be likely to
occur as a result of the present refusal, is the loss of a substantial amount of
revenue from the proposed harvesting operations, and an opportunity loss with
respect to the potential lease of the FPP land for
plantation in the future. In
this respect, the Applicant has the opportunity to apply to the Minister
pursuant to the
Nature Conservation Act 2002
, for compensation; and in
the event compensation is refused, then the Applicant
may reapply to the
Forest Practices Board under
section 18(1)(b) of the
Forest Practices Act 1985
for the certification of the
relevant forest practices plan. The Tribunal accordingly does not see the
financial effect of its determination
if the refusal appealed against is upheld,
as justifying approval of the FPP when it should otherwise be
Tribunal considers that the refusal appealed against was appropriate having
regard to all the relevant matters. The decision
of the Tribunal is that the
refusal appealed against is upheld.
Tribunal will entertain any application for an order for costs in this appeal,
if made to the Tribunal in writing with supporting
submissions within the next
14 days. If requested the Tribunal will reconvene to hear any evidence in
respect of any matter bearing
on an order for costs.
the absence of any such application for an order for costs the order of the
Tribunal is that each party bears its own costs.
