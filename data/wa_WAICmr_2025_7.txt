Roughan and City of Nedlands
[2025] WAICmr
Date of Decision: 27 June 2025
Information Act 1992
Schedule 1, clause 3(1)
March 2023, Gordon Roughan (
the complainant
) applied to the City of
) under the
Freedom of Information Act 1992
(the FOI Act
) for access to ‘all building/demolition
plans/permits engineering detail submitted and approved for [a specified
property and]
all submissions to [the Council of the agency] regarding [the
property]’.
By notice of decision dated 18 April 2023
initial decision
), the agency identified five documents within the
scope of the access application (
the disputed documents
) and refused the
complainant access to those documents on the basis they are exempt under clauses
3(1) and 4 of Schedule 1 to the
The complainant sought internal
review of the agency’s decision and, by internal review decision dated 31
May 2023, the agency
confirmed the initial decision.
On 28 July 2023, the
complainant applied to the Information Commissioner (
the Commissioner
for external review of the agency’s decision. The Commissioner obtained
the agency’s FOI file maintained in respect
of the access application,
together with copies of the disputed documents.
In May 2024, one of the
Commissioner’s officers informed the complainant’s representative
that the Acting Information
Commissioner (
the A/Commissioner
) considered
that, on the information then before her, the disputed documents were likely to
be exempt under clause 3(1) of Schedule
1 to the FOI Act (
clause 3(1)
The complainant was invited to reconsider their application for external review
or to provide further written submissions. The
complainant provided further
written submissions in July 2024.
On 18 October 2024, the A/Commissioner
provided the parties with her preliminary view of the matter
the preliminary view
), after considering all
the material then before her. It was the A/Commissioner’s preliminary
view that the disputed documents
were exempt in full under clause 3(1).
The complainant did not accept the preliminary view and made further
submissions on 1 November 2024 (
the further
submissions
After considering all the material before her,
including the disputed documents, the preliminary view and the
complainant’s
further submissions, the Commissioner agreed that the
disputed documents were exempt under clause 3(1).
Clause 3(1) provides
that matter is exempt matter if its disclosure would reveal personal information
living or dead). Personal information is exempt
under clause 3(1) subject to the application of the limits on the exemption set
out in clauses 3(2) to 3(6).
The term ‘personal information’
is defined in the Glossary to the FOI Act to mean:
[I]nformation or an opinion, whether true nor not, and whether recorded in a
material form or not, about an individual, whether living
(a) whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the
information or opinion; or
(b) who can be identified by reference to an identification number or other
identifying particular such as a fingerprint, retina
print or body sample.
The Commissioner referred to the observations about the definition of
personal information made by the Supreme Court of Western Australia
Pearlman -v- WA Information Commissioner
[2025] WASC 167
, at [78], noting
that the definition is expressed in wide terms.
The Commissioner
considered that disclosure of the disputed documents in their entirety would
reveal personal information, as defined
in the FOI Act, about the owners of the
property in question (
the third parties
) because the complainant had
requested documents relating to building works at a private home and is aware of
the identities of the
third parties. The information about the third parties
that would be revealed by disclosure of the disputed documents included the
names of the third parties, their address and the building works proposed by the
third parties to their private home. Therefore,
the Commissioner was satisfied
that the disputed documents were, on their face, exempt under clause
The complainant claimed that the disputed documents are not exempt
under clause 3(1) because the name and address of the third parties
already public knowledge and, in any event, is ascertainable from the
address of the property from publicly available records at Landgate.
Commissioner noted that, in the circumstances, the complainant is likely to be
aware of the identities of some of the individuals
referred to in the disputed
documents. However, the characterisation of the documents as exempt documents
does not depend on what
the complainant knows or claims to know of their

, at page 14; see also

Family Support

The Commissioner
considered the only limit on the exemption that may apply to the disputed
documents was clause 3(6). Clause 3(6)
provides that matter is not exempt under
clause 3(1) if its disclosure would, on balance, be in the public interest.
Under section
102(3), the onus was on the complainant, as the access applicant,
to establish that disclosure of the disputed documents would, on
balance, be in
the public interest.
As no restrictions or conditions can be placed upon
the release of documents under the FOI Act, it is well established that
of information under the FOI Act is disclosure to the world at large:
Public Transport Authority
[2018] WASC 47
. Accordingly, when
considering whether or not to disclose documents under the FOI Act, the effects
of disclosure are generally considered
as though disclosure were to the world,
rather than only to the particular access applicant.
Determining whether
or not disclosure would, on balance, be in the public interest involves
identifying the relevant competing public
interests for and against disclosure,
weighing them against each other and making a judgment as to where the balance
lies in the
circumstances of each particular case.
In favour of
disclosure, the Commissioner considered that there is a public interest in the
accountability of the agency for its actions
and decisions – including, in
this case, the manner in which the agency deals with building applications.
The Commissioner also recognised that there is a public interest in the
actions and decisions of local governments being as transparent
as possible and
in the public having confidence that local governments enforce compliance with
laws without fear or favour.
However, the Commissioner was of the view
that the public interest in the accountability of the agency was satisfied in
the circumstances
of this matter by the ability of the public to attend meetings
of the Council of the agency in relation to those matters; the public
availability of minutes of meetings of the Council of the agency; and the
ability to raise concerns regarding compliance issues with
the agency’s
compliance team.
Favouring non-disclosure, the Commissioner recognised
the strong public interest in maintaining personal privacy and noted that this
public interest may only be displaced by some other strong or compelling public
interest or interests that requires the disclosure
of personal information about
one person to another person.
The Commissioner observed that the
FOI Act is intended to make Government, its agencies and officers more
accountable, not to call
to account or unnecessarily intrude upon the privacy of
private individuals, where there is no demonstrable benefit to the public
interest in doing so.
In balancing the competing public interests, the
Commissioner concluded that the public interests favouring disclosure of the
documents were not sufficient to outweigh the strong public interest in
the protection of the personal privacy of other individuals.
Therefore, the
Commissioner was not persuaded that disclosure of the disputed documents would,
on balance, be in the public interest
and found that the limit on the exemption
in clause 3(6) did not apply.
The complainant contended that it should
be possible for the agency to provide access to edited copies of the disputed
documents under
section 24 of the FOI Act by deleting the personal information
that may be contained in those documents. The Commissioner considered
not be practicable for the agency to edit the disputed documents to delete all
the exempt matter because the severe editing
that would be required to avoid the
disclosure of the exempt matter would render the remaining matter
unintelligible. Consequently,
the Commissioner did not consider that the agency
was obliged to give the complainant access to an edited copy of the disputed
pursuant to section 24 of the FOI Act.
The Commissioner found
that the disputed documents were exempt under clause 3(1) of Schedule 1 to the
FOI Act and confirmed the agency’s
