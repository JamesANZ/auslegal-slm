SOLICITORS:
Applicant on own behalf
Hannay Lawyers for respondent
[1] At the request of Hannay Lawyers the solicitors for KD, the respondent
mother, on 12 October 2011 the Children's Court at Southport
issued a subpoena
directed to Compass Health Group, returnable before the Children’s Court
at Southport on 20 October 2011,
seeking all documents in the actual or
constructive possession of Compass Health Group relating to the assessment of
the child TD
or his carers L and LG, inclusive of all electronic and manual or
hard copy records including case notes, memorandum, case plans,
review reports,
decision making tools and reports, referrals, placement review, placement
agreements, plans, career reviews and assessments
and any other documents
created or coming into existence in respect to the child or it’s
parents/carer and it’s involvement
with the Department of Communities
(Child Safety) inclusive of all documents obtained from other agencies. TD was
the child the subject
of the child protection proceedings before the Court.
[2] It is clear from two affidavits sworn by Jennifer Worsfold, a director
of Compass Health Group, that considerable time and expense
was incurred by
Compass Health Group in complying with the subpoena, particularly given the
short notice that Compass Health Group
was given of the issue of the subpoena.
Compass Health Group seeks to recover from Hannay Lawyers costs incurred in
complying with
the subpoena, including the costs of researching their rights and
obligations with the Australia Psychological Society and obtaining
legal advice. Ms Worsfold was particularly concerned at her confidentiality
obligations in relation to the material the
subject of the subpoena.
evolution of the law pertaining to payment to persons for the cost of compliance
with a subpoena was explored in Bank of NSW

[1928] ArgusLawRp 98
(1981) 35 ALR
Sheppard J referred to, amongst other authorities, the decision of Collins v
Godefory (1831) 109 ER 1040. He quoted the following
passage from that
“Assuming the offer to pay
the six guineas without costs was evidence of an express promise by the
defendant to pay that sum
to the plaintiff as a compensation to him for his loss
of time, still, if the defendant was not bound by law to pay that sum, the
to do so, not having been accepted, will not avail the plaintiff. If it be a
duty imposed by law upon a party regularly subpoenaed,
to attend from time to
time to give his evidence, then a promise to give him any remuneration for loss
of time incurred in such attendance
is a promise without consideration. We think
that such a duty is imposed by law; and on consideration of the Statute of
and of the cases which have been decided on this subject, we are all
of the opinion that a party cannot maintain an action for compensation
of time in attending a trial as a witness. We are aware of the practice which
has prevailed in certain cases, of allowing,
as costs between party and party,
so much per day for the attendance of professional men; but that practice cannot
alter the law.
What the effect of our decision may be, is not for our
consideration. We think, on principle, that an action does not lie for a
compensation
to a witness for loss of time in attendance under a
[4] Having canvassed myriad authorities, including Collins v
Godefory, Sheppard J stated:
“The principles which, in my opinion, the
authorities to which I have referred establish are:
1. Citizens including corporations are bound to comply with subpoenas to produce
documents properly served upon them. Failure to
comply will render the citizen
liable to be dealt with for contempt of court.
2. A person will not be bound
to comply with a subpoena if it is oppressive, because it is too wide or too
uncertain or because it
has been served too late to enable the person on whom it
is served to have a reasonable opportunity of complying with it. It will,
however, remain valid until set aside upon a notice of motion taken out for this
purpose. And if a subpoena is served late, it would
be unwise of the person upon
whom it is served not to come to court and explain why he has been unable to
produce the documents.
3. A person upon whom a subpoena, whether to produce
documents or otherwise, is served is entitled at common law (but originally
because of the terms of the statute 5 Eliz c9, s 12) and now under
rules of court to an adequate indemnity for his expenses of coming
to and from
court and for his sustenance during the time he is required to remain there.
Such expenses may be recovered in an action
based upon an implied contract from
the person, that is the party (not usually his solicitor), who causes the
subpoena to be served.
He may refuse to give evidence or produce documents until
he has a proper assurance that these expenses will be met. He is not obliged
come to court unless he has received a proper sum for conduct money, that is
money which will enable him to travel to court: O27,r3.
4. Professional
witnesses, especially doctors and attorney, and seafaring witnesses were also
entitled at common law to recover an
amount to indemnify them for loss of time
whilst they were detained at court as a result of the services of a subpoena. No
person was so entitled.
5. That position changed in England and
Australia from about the time of the passing of the Common Law Procedure Act
1852, pursuant
to which scales of fees for witnesses were promulgated.
Thereafter witnesses have been entitled, according to the appropriate scale,
payment for loss of time as well as for payment of expenses of travelling to and
from, and remaining at court. Whether the right
to recover is based upon an
implied contract or upon a statutory entitlement arising by reason of the
provisions of the rules, it
is unnecessary to decide.
6. But it should be
emphasized that unless the payment is provided for in the rules there can be no
recovery. Collins v Godefory remains
the law. The citizen’s duty to aid
the administration of the law by attending remains paramount and is the reason
can be no recovery for loss of time as distinct form out of pocket
expenses in the absence of specific provisions in rules of court.
Furthermore,
and this needs to be stressed, it is not possible, in the sense of it not being
lawful, for a contract to be made between
a party to litigation and a person
upon whom a subpoena is served whereby that person is promised more than he
would receive upon
the basis of what is provided in rules of court. That is the
essential proposition for which Collins v Godefory is authority.”
[5] His Honour went on to hold that there was no provision in the Federal Court
rules which permitted a bank to recover $1,392.50
being the cost of complying
with the subpoena for the time bank officers engaged in searching and copying at
various places the documents
the subject of the subpoena.
Children’s Court is constituted under the Children’s Court Act 1992.
The Court is established as a court of record
under s 4 of that Act. Section
5(3) of that Act provides that if the Children’s Court is not required to
be constituted by
a Children’s Court Judge it may be constituted by a
Children’s Court magistrate or if such magistrate is not available
magistrate.
[7] It is clear than that in exercising jurisdiction in the
Children’s Court, a magistrate is acting as a member of the
[8] The Children’s Court Rules 1997 apply to
Child Protection applications such as this
Rule 27(2) enables the registrar upon the application of a party to a proceeding
to issue a subpoena requiring the attendance of
a person before the court to
give evidence in a proceeding or produce stated documents and things. The Rules
are silent as to the
cost of complying with a subpoena.
[9] Ms Worsfold
contends that the Children’s Court has power to make an order in relation
to the costs of Compass Health Group
complying with the subpoena by virtue of
the provisions of the
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999
of the UCPR empowers the court to make an order for the payment of any
loss or expense incurred in complying with a subpoena. However
those rules apply
to civil proceedings in the Supreme, District and Magistrate’s
The Rules will only apply to the
Children’s Court exercising jurisdiction under the
Child Protection Act
if a Magistrate’s Court in the Rules includes a reference to a
magistrate constituting the Children’s Court. The UCPR
are enacted
pursuant to
Supreme Court of Queensland Act 1991
which empowers the
Governor in Counsel to make rules for the practices and procedures of the
Supreme Court, the District Court or
the Magistrates Court.
[10] There has
been some recent judicial decision and comment on whether a Children’s
Court constituted by a District Court
Judge is a District Court.
Section 118(3)
District Court of Queensland Act 1967
provides that a party who is
dissatisfied with any other judgement of the District Court may appeal to the
Court of Appeal. In SBD
v Chief Executive, Department of Child Safety
in Keane JA (with whom Muir JA and Lyons J agree) stated; “It is
arguable that the Children's Court constituted by a Judge
is not the District
Court for the purposes of
District Court of Queensland Act
Indeed counsel for the applicant advanced just that
. It is to be noted that Keane JA did
not express a concluded view because in any event, if that section did apply it
was not appropriate
to grant leave.
[11] In KAA & Anor –v-
Schemioneck & Anor (2)
[2007] QCA 449
Daubney J, with whom Muir JA agreed,
“Counsel for the Department submitted that an appeal as of
right does not lie to this court against the decision and orders
of the three
Children’s Court. It was submitted on behalf of the Department that ....
whilst, pursuant to
District Court of Queensland Act 1967
an appeal against a judgment of the District Court may lie to this Court with
the leave of the Court, with the reference to
“District Court” in
does not extend to encompass a reference to District Court judges who are
sitting as Children’s Court judges. Children’s
Court judges are
appointed under
Division 2 of the Act and, it is submitted, whilst
District Court judges are appointed as Children’s Court judges, an
appointment
as a Children’s Court judge is a separate and district
appointment to that as a District Court judge. The submission is that
of appeal, with leave, granted by
District Court of Queensland
does not extend to a decision of a Children’s Court constituted by a
judge on an appeal from a decision and orders of a Children’s
magistrate.
Some significant support for the argument advanced on behalf of
the respondent is found in the judgement of Keane JA, with whom Muir
Lyons J agreed in SBD v Chief Executive, Department of Child Safety. However,
his Honour in that case declined to go so far
as to hold expressly that there is
no right of appeal, even with leave, to this Court from an appellant decision of
a District Court
Judge sitting as the Children’s Court.
manner in which these matters have been argued before this Court, I consider
that this is an inappropriate vehicle for the
determination of this
Daubrey J agreed with the approach of Keane JA in the decision
in SBD v Chief Executive, Department of Child Safety that “if
intention of the legislature that there should be no further appeal, even by way
of leave under
....from the appellate court being the Children's Court
constituted by a judge, then it would be desirable for the position to be
beyond doubt by the
legislature.”
[12] McMurdo P in KAA
anor –v- Schemioneck & Anor (No 2)
[2007] QCA 449
stated “It is
by no means clear that there is an avenue to apply for leave to appeal from a
decision of the Children’s
Court to this Court under
Court of Queensland Act 1967
(Qld)”, citing the decision of SBD v Chief
Executive, Department of Child Safety. Her Honour then stated, “Accepting
for present purposes there is such an avenue, the applicants have not
demonstrated in any of these three applications any reason
warranting a grant of
leave to appeal to this
[13] In Cousins v HAL &
[2008] QCA 49
Fraser JA stated with reference to
Court of Queensland Act 1967
Section 118
authorises appeals only from
the District Court. That is a reference, of course, to the District Court of
Queensland established
District Court of Queensland Act 1967
That Court is a court of record constituted by any of the District Court Judges.
It is to be distinguished from the Children’s
Court which is a separate
court established as a court of record by section 4 of the Children’s
Court Act 1992. The Children’s
Court is not constituted by any of the
District Court judges. Rather, section 5 of that Act provides that the members
of the Children’s
Court are, so far as judges are concerned, a
Children’s Court Judge, or and only if such a judge is not available, a
Court judge. That on occasions where a Children’s Court Judge is
not available the court may be constituted by a District Court
Judge does not
establish an identity between the Children's’ Court and the District
Court. The Courts are established by separate
legislation and have a different,
albeit overlapping, membership. Ultimately, the question is whether the
Children's Court of Queensland
established by the Children’s Court Act
1992 may also be regarded as the District Court for the purposes of the right of
conferred by
District Court of Queensland Act 1967
question was adverted to in SBD, in which Keane JA observed that it was arguable
that the Children’s Court constituted
by a judge was not the District
Court for that purpose. It is necessary to decide the point here. For the
reasons I have given, the
conclusion is unavoidable, in my opinion, that these
are different courts. It follows that I must conclude that the Children’s
Court is not the District Court for the purpose of
so that no appeal
lies from a decision of the Children’s Court, constituted by a District
Court judge under
District Court of Queensland Act
[14] In FY & Anor v
Department of Child Safety
[2009] QCA 67
, Keane JA with whom Muir JA and Daubney
J agreed stated, “At the outset of the discussion of this issue, it is
necessary to
note that the respondents to this application argue that no appeal
lies to this court, even by leave, from a decision of the Children’s
as the appellate court. There is much to be said in favour of this view.”
The footnote then referred to the paragraphs
I have previously referred to in
the decisions in SBD v Chief Executive, Department of Child Safety and Cousins v
2008 [QCA] 49 at pages 8-9. Keane JA then states, “But it
is unnecessary to decide this question because it is clear that,
even if this
court has the discretion to grant leave to appeal under
Court of Queensland Act
, this is not a case in which that discretion should be
exercised in favour of the applicants.”
[15] In CAO v Dept of Child Safety & Ors
[2009] QCA 169
Keane JA, (with
whom the Chief Justice and Fraser JA agreed) expressed his agreement with the
views expressed by Fraser JA in Cousins
v HAL & Anor. In CAR & Anor v
Department of Child Safety [2010] ACQ 27 the Court of Appeal unanimously
followed Cousins v
HAL & Anor.
[16] Applying the reasoning of Fraser JA
in Cousins v HAL& Anor
[2008] QCA 49
at pages 8-9 the fact that a Magistrate
constitutes a Children’s Court does not make that court a
Magistrate’s Court
for the purpose of the UCPR. As there is no provision
in the Children's Court Rules permitting a subpoenaed witness to recover
incurred in complying with a subpoena the Children’s Court has no
power to make an order for re-imbursement of those
[17] Accordingly, whilst it is of concern that Compass Health Group
has been put to considerable time and expense in complying with
the subpoena
issued by the Court, the only cost to which Compass Health Group is entitled is
the costs of attending Court in compliance
with the subpoena. I note that there
is not prescribed rate for the Children’s Court but there seems no reason
why the rate
prescribed for persons appearing in a court pursuant to the UCPR
would not be an appropriate amount. I note the attendance fee for
a professional
witness is $74
and that travelling is allowed
at 74c per kilometre
. Assuming a 12km
return trip travelling expenses equate to $8.88. I order the respondent to pay
the costs of Compass Health Group
fixed in the sum of $82.88 being conduct money
and travelling expenses due and owning pursuant to the subpoena served upon
Health Group by the respondent’s solicitors. There is nothing in
the Children’s Court Act or Rules that permits me to
order that the
payment be made by a person other than a party to the proceedings.
