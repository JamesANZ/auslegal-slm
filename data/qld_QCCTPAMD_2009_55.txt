REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is a decision on a disciplinary proceeding commenced by the Chief Executive
against the respondent Robert John O’Neill.
The charges against the
respondent are set out in an application filed in the Tribunal on 18 August
2009. The evidence in support
of those charges, as particularised in annexures
to the application, is found in two statements of Sean Linnane filed in the
Each of the statements exhibits other statements and documents
provided to the Chief Executive’s investigators by persons
dealings with the respondent.
proceeding was commenced by the Chief Executive pursuant to
section 497
Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000
(“the Act”). The
grounds relied upon by the Chief Executive for starting this disciplinary
proceeding are found in
section 496(1)(g)(i)
and (1)(g)(iii).
Section 529
the Act sets out the orders the Tribunal may make in a disciplinary proceeding.
Section 107
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act 2003
CCT Act”) provides a further basis for the Tribunal’s powers in
deciding disciplinary proceedings.
Appearances
the hearing of the application, Mr Danen appeared for the Chief Executive.
There was no appearance by or on behalf of the respondent.
A notice of
today’s hearing was sent to the respondent by post on 21 October 2009 to
the address, which I accept, on the evidence
in a statement of Mr Linnane, as
the respondent’s residential address.
have considered the application of section 59 of the CCT Act. In the events
that have occurred, I am satisfied that the respondent
has been given notice of
the hearing and did not appear. I therefore proceeded to hear and determine the
matter in the respondent’s
absence, pursuant to section 59 of the CCT
Grounds for taking disciplinary proceedings
have considered the evidence filed on behalf of the Chief Executive. I am
satisfied that the respondent has demonstrated by his
conduct that he is not a
suitable person to hold a license under the Act and that in carrying on a
business or performing activities
as a licensed motor dealer the respondent has
been incompetent or acted in an unprofessional way. In particular I am
satisfied that
the respondent has engaged in the conduct particularised at
paragraphs 4 – 10, 11 – 21, 22 – 29, 30 – 31,
45 and 46 – 54 of annexure B to the application.
Appropriate orders
the Tribunal is satisfied that there are appropriate grounds for the Chief
Executive to take disciplinary proceedings against the
respondent, it is
necessary to consider the orders, if any, that should be made. It is well
settled that a disciplinary proceeding
in the Tribunal involves the exercise of
a power that is entirely protective. Although it may involve deprivation or
the person disciplined, there is no element of punishment involved.
In discharging this protective function, the Tribunal’s
role is to frame
orders to deter any repetition of the offending conduct, to indicate to other
licensees that the conduct is unacceptable
and to maintain public confidence in
the regulatory regime established under the Act.
conduct of the respondent, which I am satisfied occurred, was very serious. It
involved the taking of vehicles on consignment
from persons, selling those
vehicles and then failing to account to the owners for the proceeds of sale, in
whole or in part. A
substantial sum of the order of $60,000 remains outstanding
to the various vehicle owners who placed vehicles with the respondent
In the case of Mr Milham the conduct involved the disappearance of a vehicle
purchased from the respondent and returned
to him for repairs under warranty.
respondent’s conduct directly affected six consumers who placed their cars
with him for sale or purchased a car from him.
As a result of the
respondent’s conduct these consumers have, or in all likelihood will, seek
compensation for their losses
pursuant to other avenues available under the
has been no cooperation from the respondent in dealing with the disciplinary
charges. None of the charges or particulars was
admitted by the respondent.
The respondent has not given any indication of remorse for his conduct or the
consequences suffered
by affected consumers by reason of that conduct. No
references or other evidence as to the respondent’s general character
conduct have been offered. In short, there are no significant mitigating
factors to be considered in determining the appropriate
disciplinary orders.
the circumstances, I consider that the respondent’s conduct and the
absence of any indication of concern for the effect of
his conduct upon
consumers make it inappropriate for the respondent to hold a license or a
certificate of registration under the
Act or to be an Executive Officer of a
company holding a license under the Act.
respondent held a motor dealer’s principal license between 28 September
2005 and 28 September 2008. It was during this
period that the conduct the
subject of these Disciplinary Proceedings occurred. It is apparent from the
documentation produced to
the Tribunal that over this period the respondent used
his license to enable various other legal entities, corporations and trusts
engage in a motor dealers business without any of those entities holding the
appropriate license.
the respondent no longer holds a license, I consider it appropriate as a means
of protecting consumers from such conduct
that orders be made preventing the
respondent from resuming a license under the Act. For those reasons I propose
to make the following
to section 529(1)(b) of the Act I will order that the respondent pay a fine of
$14,000.00 to the applicant within six months
of the date of this order.
will order pursuant to section 529(1)(d)(ii) of the Act that the respondent be
permanently disqualified from holding a license or
registration certificate
under the Act.
will order pursuant to section 529(1)(e) of the Act that the respondent be
disqualified permanently from being an executive officer
of a corporation that
holds a license under the Act.
I will order pursuant to section 71 of the CCT Act that the respondent pay the
applicant’s cost of the proceeding fixed
in the amount of $1,000.00 within
six months of the date of this order.
copy of this decision should also be sent to the respondent at 44 Little Norman
Street Southport Queensland 4215.
