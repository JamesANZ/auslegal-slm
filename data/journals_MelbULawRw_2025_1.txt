Four decades have passed since the landmark decision of the High Court of
Australia in

elderly migrant parents to support an overdraft

of a company controlled by the parents’

The principle applied was that a legal transaction resulting from the
unconscientious use, by one party, of an opportunity arising
from a known
position of relative special disadvantage affecting the other party will not be
enforced — or will be set aside
— upon the successful application of
the party of whom unfair advantage was shown to have been

extent, the High Court’s (at times) elusive expressions

occurred most recently in

But far and away the principal cause of the current problematics has, in our
respectful view, lain in the apparent preference of

been dutifully echoed by lower and intermediate courts, for ‘language

exploitation might be said to ‘offend

If a precept of non-exploitation truly underlies the equitable jurisdiction to
relieve against an unconscionable dealing, then it
should follow that the
requisite elements of an unconscionable dealing claim will reflect the component
parts of a basic exploitation
claim. Those elements — the doctrinal
criteria of an unconscionable dealing claim — are discussed in Part III.

view, that, in order to satisfy basic rule of law
requirements,
any substantive doctrine of
law or equity must be ‘conceptually sound and explicit in its policy

What, then, is the underlying justification for judicial interference with legal

From the Too Vague to
the Too Specific?
Now, given that the Australian legal system provides a (more or less) neutral
facility to render legally effective the creation and,
if necessary, enforcement
or maintenance of ‘binding’ consensual or voluntary arrangements
such as contracts and other
dispositions,
it follows that it must also recognise a raft of so-called ‘invalidating
circumstances or conditions’ that dispense from
the normal consequences of
such transactions (or dispositions) being concluded in legal
implied by the very notion of ‘voluntary assumption’, or
‘consensual transfer’,
it is uncontroversial that unconscionable dealing forms part of this raft of
invalidating reasons, the more precise rationalisation
of the doctrine within
the wider raft remains a matter of ongoing debate
uncertainty.
In our view, a convincing rationalisation of the equitable doctrine of
unconscionable dealing in normative terms remains indispensable
to the creation
of a stable set of application criteria that are linked to and conceptually
aligned with the underlying rationale.
Ambiguity as to the doctrine’s
normative foundations can readily convert into confusion over its specific proof
elements, which
can in turn imperil the predictive certainty expected of private
law adjudication when those proof elements are called upon for application
the established facts, especially in so-called ‘hard’ or
‘marginal’ cases.
conceptualisation of the doctrine is also necessary to facilitate the
intellectual and practical differentiation of unconscionable
dealing from other
exculpatory doctrines within the raft that also regulate significant
power–vulnerability relationships in
transactional settings and which may
be attracted by the same or similar fact patterns. Even accepting some
inevitable overlap at
the boundaries,
kind of conceptual clarity is necessary, not least to justify the continued
maintenance of the jurisdiction as a standalone
category (ie apart from other
recognised heads of transactional relief)
or else, perhaps, to support an
argument for absorption of such existing heads into the unconscionable
dealing jurisdiction itself.
Unfortunately, the track record of Australian courts (and, albeit to a lesser
extent, commentators) in articulating the distinct rationale
underlying the
unconscionable dealing jurisdiction is not as good as it could

Traditionally, in
equity, ‘victimisation’ has been taken to signify ‘an
unconscientious use of the power arising
out of [the] circumstances and
conditions’ of the parties, which ‘can consist either of the active
extortion of a benefit
or the passive acceptance of a benefit in unconscionable
circumstances’.

exploitation’ of the claimant’s weakness, whereby exploitation

‘predation’ represents the correct cognitive standard, though, it is
difficult to see how more ‘passive’
instances of victimisation, such
as those that occurred in
itself, could plausibly be said to have
met that threshold.
Although Deane J said
that the bank manager in that case had ‘simply closed his eyes to the
vulnerability of Mr and Mrs Amadio
and the disability which adversely affected
them’, his Honour was also, in the very same paragraph, at pains to acquit

weaker party initiated the impugned transaction, rather than the stronger party

Here, the complaint seems more to do with ‘opportunism’ than
‘predation’, with the latter implying an inevitably
relationship between the victimiser and their
Interestingly, the imperative terminology of ‘predation’ seems to
quietly fallen away in decisions of the High Court after
although the (presumably
synonymous) locutions of ‘exploitation’ and
‘victimisation’ have remained.

[i]n Australia, the central concern of a court administering equity in

to be to relieve

to his or her interests.

suggest that once the High Court narrows the jurisdiction’s focus down to
a specific, targeted form of opprobrious conduct
‘exploitation’, the risk then arises of lower courts subsequently
being straitjacketed by the exploitation concept
itself: that is, in a manner
that might be counterproductive to equity’s ultimate ability to deliver on
what ought to be regarded
as ‘the real justice of’ cases of the
present kind.
Why Does (and Should)
Exploitation in Transactions Offend Equity’s Conscience?
Assuming, for now, that a precept of non-exploitation is what normatively
underlies the
principle as a conscience-based operation of equity,
what then, exactly, is the ‘construct of values and standards [of personal
conduct] against which the ... [unconscionable dealer] ... is to be
judged’ in the present connection?
examination into that construct is an important exercise, for it affords a
starting point for testing the elasticity of the exploitation
Relatedly, an examination also produces a platform for assessing the true weight
of that concept’s explanatory power
in the present context and across
different transaction types — that is, as an
justificatory reason for interference with legal transactions, whether contract
or perfected inter vivos gift, in the name of the
unconscionable dealing
competing values and standards
at play in unconscionable dealing cases, the
exploitation concept proves inapt — too narrow — to plausibly
rationalise
the outcomes of the spectrum of cases that have been decided in the
name of the equitable doctrine. We will also suggest that it
may further be
unfit for addressing contemporary norms and values that, in our view,
to inform the modern doctrine.
For now, however, we will take at face value the courts’ own vocabulary in
modern unconscionable dealing cases and consider
just what an insistence on
‘exploitation’ may logically require to be shown as the elements of,
or considerations relevant
to, the claim.
In the absence of a dedicated curial definition of exploitation, we will
assume that the concept carries its ordinary juridical meaning:
unjust advantage of another for one’s own benefit or selfish
Both ordinary and philosophical meanings are to similar

phraseology of ‘
exploitation’ or

unconscionable dealing
Strictly speaking, there can be no instances of
interpersonal
exploitation that are other than ‘unfair’ or
‘unconscientious’, for ‘[t]o characterize a relationship

respect) — as opposed to a
To our knowledge, the ‘values and standards’ that inform and
explain equity’s antipathy towards interpersonal exploitation
transactional settings have never been systematically articulated by Australian
courts. They are, however, assumed by them and,
if one looks closely enough,
implicit in judgments across various pockets of the private law. Thus, it is
possible to glean such
values and standards from intermittent dicta across
various Anglo-Commonwealth legal systems over time, including from cases that
not directly involve the equitable doctrine of unconscionable dealing.
The starting point of the unwritten law, no doubt, is the
‘liberal’ conception of transfer or exchange: the law in general
not ‘paternalistic’,
it leaves each of us free to enlist others in the pursuit of our own
self-interest and, accordingly, to make such bargains
or other dispositions as
we see fit, ‘[h]owever improvident, unreasonable, or unjust ... [they] may
This conception emphasises not
only the values of liberty and autonomy but also individual
responsibility;
for under the liberal ideal, people are generally seen to ‘deserve’
to have their lives determined by the choices they
make, irrespective of whether
those choices turn out well or badly for
Not to respect (ie recognise, enforce
or sustain) regretted transactions legally entered into voluntarily
inevitably denies the
transacting party the equivalent right (ie
to self-determination and hence denies their equal status as a freely

But a basal assumption behind the liberal conception, of course, is that the
actors concerned are governed by conditions (including
political systems) under
which it is possible to act ‘legally autonomously’, hence
responsibly, when exercising situation-altering

reasons, sometimes described as ‘constitutional’ or
‘situational’ (or both), individuals
may find themselves seriously
unequalised vis-a-vis others in pre-transactional
encounters.
This is to the point, at times, where ‘the presumption of rational
autonomy in self-interested contract-making is
displaced’.
And while, on the liberal
ideal, no objection can be taken to the mere existence of (even very serious)
inequality or transactional
disadvantage between actors per
through particularised doctrines such as unconscionable dealing, nevertheless
makes it harder for power-holders to use their
interpersonal power or relative
strategic advantage.
The law does this,
essentially, by ensuring that such power or advantage, if it is to be exercised
at all, must only be used consistently
with the injunction against using fellow

On the liberal conception, serious inequality,

stronger party, functions merely as a reason to impose context-specific side

party’s normal transactional liberty vis-a-vis the weaker

Quite apart from the question of whether such a flagrant non-observance of
transactional side constraints should be seen as necessary
in every case to
offend equity’s conscience through unconscionable dealing — a matter
to which we shall return below
— it is certainly sufficient for that
In the end, we believe that equity objects to transactional exploitation
because the practice involves an unauthorised interference with the specially
protected domains of a fellow person’s autonomy
and proprietary integrity.
Exploiters (ie unconscionable dealers) selfishly violate the other
party’s general ‘right’ (ie ‘legal immunity’)
not have resources or value transferred away from them — here, under the
colour of an objectively valid contract or other
legally perfected disposition
— without their full transactional consent. In such transference,
exploiters avail themselves
of strategic opportunities that are, or ought to be,
denied to them under the rules and ethos of contract bargaining or, as the case
may be, of the facilitative social institution of gifting. By failing to observe
(or respond to) the side constraints (or ‘legal
disabilities’) that
the law engrafts upon transactional liberty when dealing with persons known to
be specially disadvantaged
relative to them, unconscionable dealers ignore a
basic demand articulated in the liberty principle itself — namely, to
the special status of fellow jural agents as ‘freely choosing,
rationally valuing, specially efficacious ... moral
personalit[ies]’.
Such a failure
ultimately results in an unjust reallocation of resources between the
transacting parties inter se, and this reallocation
warrants reversal in the
name of corrective justice.
A final point relating to the precise manner in which unconscionable dealing
— if the doctrine is based strictly upon an anti-exploitation
— offends equity’s conscience, especially in contractual contexts,
is that exploitation is a
purely procedural
concern. In contrast to other
Anglo-Commonwealth jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom and Canada, whose
respective doctrines
of unconscionable dealing and unconscionable bargain appear
to be preconditioned on proof of both procedural unconscionability
substantive unconscionability,
Australian doctrine is purely procedural in its
Australia, substantive unconscionability serves merely a
— namely, ‘supporting the inference that a position of disadvantage
existed’ and also ‘tending to show
that an unfair use was made of
the occasion’.
This aligns with a
liberal conception of contractual justice: ‘unconscionable bargains’
simply lack the element of ‘voluntariness’
(ie procedural fairness)
that would otherwise allow a court to conclude that the values exchanged by the
parties under the impugned
contract were ‘equivalent’ in the
relevant (ie normatively ‘sufficient’, qualitative)
On this approach,
‘contractual imbalance’ (or ‘substantive unfairness’) is
of the unconscionable dealing complaint, although it
may be relevant — even perhaps crucial in some cases — to inferring
procedural unfairness.
The question to which we will return in Part IV is whether
‘exploitation’, although capable of serving as a compelling
justification for the grant of relief, is nevertheless an unduly constricting
basis for conceptualising the normative underpinnings
principle and doctrine. In Part III of this article, though, we enumerate and
consider the proof elements of an unconscionable dealing
claim on the basis that
they match the anti-exploitation thesis expounded by the modern High Court (as
discussed in this Part). However,
we will propose in Part IV what we consider to
be a preferable justificatory foundation for the subject jurisdiction (as
to strict ‘exploitation avoidance’), with a corresponding
adjustment to the doctrinal criteria and general methodological
approach which
we invoke in aid of that alternative foundation.
III Doctrinal
The Doctrinal
Formulations (and Burden of Proof)
If the normative purpose of the unconscionable dealing doctrine is the
avoidance of interpersonal exploitation in the (active) procurement
or (passive)
acceptance of legal benefits via voluntary or consensual transactions, it
follows that the doctrinal criteria enlisted
to implement that purpose ought to
match the bilateral structure of a basic ‘exploitation claim’: (a)
an inquiry, first,
into the circumstances or situation of C that rendered C
vulnerable to merely instrumental use, in the manner of
‘exploitation’,
at the hands of D (namely, peculiar asymmetries in
power, opportunity or ability
and (b) a sequent
assessment as to whether D
‘exploited’ (ie made
unfair strategic use of) those circumstances or the situation to their own
advantage, which is the
of interpersonal exploitation itself,
so as to justify denying them the fruits of an otherwise perfectly lawful
transaction.
This is (more or less) in parallel with contemporary formulations of the
unconscionable dealing doctrine in Australia, which, as mentioned
emphasise the need for C to show equitable fault in the manner of D taking
‘unconscientious advantage ... of [C’s]
disabling condition or

Deane J formulated the criteria of an unconscionable dealing
claim slightly differently in
— in a manner resonant with
formulations in 19
-century English expectant-heir case law:
The jurisdiction is long established as extending generally to circumstances in
which (i) a party to a transaction was under a special
disability in dealing
with the other party with the consequence that there was an absence of any
reasonable degree of equality between
them and (ii) that disability was
sufficiently evident to the stronger party to make it prima facie unfair or
‘unconscientious’
that he procure, or accept, the weaker
party’s assent to the impugned transaction in the circumstances in which
he procured
or accepted it. Where such circumstances are shown to have existed,
an onus is cast upon the stronger party to show that the transaction

transaction is thrown on the person who seeks to

distinguished between, on the one hand, the presumption that — at least at
the time — was understood to arise
by operation of law (for public policy
reasons) in Class 2 undue influence cases, which is said to create a persuasive
(ie not merely
evidential) burden on the influential party, and, on the other
hand, the ‘presumption’ that is sometimes said to operate
unconscionable dealing cases, which is merely an ‘inference’ that
arises ‘from the facts of the case’:
the persuasive burden remains
on C throughout to show that the impugned transaction ‘is the product of

The approach of Brennan J with respect to the onus of proof in unconscionable
dealing cases has recently been criticised. Ying Khai
Liew and Debbie Yu suggest
that it was the product of an ‘oversight’ on his Honour’s
part, as his Honour was merely
‘purporting to apply the principle as set
without modification’, including in relation to the
onus of proof.
The authors argue that
this suggestion is fortified by the consideration that Brennan J’s
statements on the onus point were
‘strictly obiter’, as ‘the
reversal of burden of proof was not in issue on the facts of that case, where
clear and overt exploitation of C’s position was obviously
unconscionable’.
Liew and Yu
comment that Brennan J’s ‘approach has not been followed’ and
argue that it ‘ought not to be
followed’ compared to their own
interpretation of the position in
namely, that ‘once C
has established the first and second requirements’, D then ‘bears
burden of establishing
that the transaction was fair, just, and
reasonable’.
In other words, Liew
and Yu regard the answering party to be carrying the legal, or
, burden in relation to the proposition that must be
established (that ‘the transaction was fair, just, and reasonable’)
and not merely a tactical or evidential burden (ie a
burden of production
only) to bring evidence forward to affect the weight of, or to throw doubt on,
the initial inference (or ‘prima-facie case’)
established by C upon
proof of the first two elements.
We disagree with Liew and Yu. First, it is inconceivable that a judge of
Brennan J’s experience and standing would simply fail
to comprehend how
burdens and presumptions work in civil litigation. His Honour would certainly
have appreciated that, once created,
the persuasive burden (on a single issue)
can never ‘shift’ during the course of a
Far from being an
‘oversight’ in his Honour’s reasoning, Brennan J clearly
appreciated the true purport of Deane

the tag ‘prima facie’ denotes, Deane J understood that what was
being created under the first two steps of his Honour’s
formulation was
merely a provisional burden establishing a ‘“prima facie”
case’ — a permissible inference
or provisional conclusion of
unconscionable dealing only — which is consistent with the creation of an
, rather than persuasive, burden on the other
That Brennan J understood this is
also confirmed by his Honour’s reference to the
contrasting
‘presumption’ in Class 2 undue influence cases where, for public
policy reasons, a
burden was created in favour of the
subordinate party upon proof of a specified risk (that of fiduciary disloyalty,
essentially).
No equivalent public
policy reasons exist to justify a similar approach in
unconscionable dealing cases where, at least traditionally, the risk to be
managed is of a completely different nature than in a situation of relational
undue influence.
The further assertion of Liew and Yu that Brennan J’s statements
regarding the onus of proof were ‘strictly obiter’
is not convincing
Where the overall burden of
persuasion lies in an unconscionable dealing claim cannot plausibly turn on mere
happenstance —
whether the transaction-affecting exploitation alleged was
‘clear and overt’ or not. That, in
, ‘the reversal
of burden of proof was not in issue on the facts of that case, where D’s
clear and overt exploitation
of C’s position was obviously
unconscionable’, is merely recognition of the fact that C’s
persuasive burden could
be met by resort to direct evidence alone and that
inferences from indirect evidence were not needed to bridge the sorts of
gap that are prone to arise in more passive instances of interpersonal
exploitation.
Finally, although the
authors claim that Brennan J’s approach ‘has not been
followed’ in Australia, it has not
been contradicted
In fact, no subsequent
unconscionable dealing case heard by the High Court has been decided in a manner
that could plausibly cause
the reader to assume that the respondent to the claim
carries a persuasive burden as to establishing non-exploitation (if that is
really underlies the
equitable jurisdiction) as opposed to merely an evidential burden to
undermine the claimant’s allegations of actual exploitation,
inference or
direct proof.
Componentry of an Unconscionable Dealing Claim (as Currently Formulated towards
‘Exploitation Avoidance’)
Conceptually, at least, the first component of the
— special disadvantage — seems to generate little in the way of
contention nowadays.
A finding of
special disadvantage seriously affecting C’s ability to conserve their own
best interests in a transaction vis-a-vis
D signifies the point at which, in
equitable contemplation, it would be unjust to hold C to the normal level of
individual responsibility
expected of the generality of transacting parties at
law (particularly in contractual
The first component involves
a finding that C is ‘vulnerable to exploitation’ or
‘advantage-taking’ at the
hands of D — that is, if D
sufficiently knows of the opportunity for advantage-taking that has been placed
in their hands.
Recall that such a known
vulnerability results in a responsibility (ie a precautionary side constraint)
being imposed upon D to modify
their pre-transactional behaviour so as to avoid
‘taking unfair advantage of’ their dominant position relative to C

Thus, subject to what we will ultimately argue in Part IV, if we are to take
seriously modern courts’ repeated assertions that

principle of unconscionable dealing, it must follow that, while interpersonal
exploitation involves an agency-responsible pre-transactional
D’s part to respond adequately to C’s special disadvantage (as a
sine qua non of not exploiting the weaker
party), such a failure is
accompanied by a particular state of mind
. In its legal, philosophical
and ordinary sense, ‘exploitation’, whether it takes an active (ie
overt, positive) form
or a passive (ie non-overt, omissive) form, is not an
accidental, casual or wholly incidental process of misusing (hence abusing)
another; there is a demanding state-of-mind requirement on the part of D, the
would-be exploiter.
As John Lawrence
Hill has explained, a genuine charge of exploitation implies that the exploiter
must act (or, as the case may be,
omit to act) purposefully or with reckless
disregard for the subjectively known
special vulnerability of the exploitee; the exploiter must either

The High Court in

agency-responsibility (ie fault or blame) is not met by proof of mere neglect:

party is not sufficient’ for the purposes of the equitable doctrine

With respect, though, this strikes us as inconsistent with what, after
considered discussion, appears to be an inescapable consequence
of the reasoning
and it accords with
the understanding of at least one intermediate appellate court in Australia
Liew and Yu have suggested that when courts use the language of
‘exploitation’ in the present context, this ‘is
understood not as a positive requirement but [rather as] a loose description of
the effects of the doctrine’
that when a court sets aside ‘an unfair or unjust transaction’ where
D in fact possessed knowledge that was less
than ‘actual’ (including
where D merely had ‘constructive knowledge’), this ‘can be
described as having
the effect of preventing C from being
exploited’.
We do not think that
this is consistent with what was said or implied in
Ultimately, Liew and
Yu’s view presents an account of the jurisdiction that depends on resort
to a legal fiction or contrivance
— and one that could easily be avoided
if Australian courts had not become so wedded to such lofty justificatory
epithets as
‘exploitation’, ‘victimisation’ and
‘predation’ in the first
For there can be no
‘exploitation’ without a human ‘exploiter’. Exploitation
is an (agency-responsible)
; it cannot plausibly be an
‘event’ or ‘effect’ of some antecedent act that is
itself less than exploitative
To suggest otherwise can only
be to needlessly and unhelpfully fictionalise what is really
and to deny exploitation as a
concern — that is, present causally at the moment of
transaction formation.
That would be to
alter the current understanding of the unconscionable dealing jurisdiction in
Australia, even if, as we will ultimately
argue below, that understanding
to be altered — and altered in a way that does not resort to
pretence in the explication of the ‘exploitation’
or any other
justificatory concept.
As will be seen,
we consider the exploitation concept simply to be the wrong basal concept to
explain (and justify) curial interference
with transactions in the name of the
equitable jurisdiction to relieve against an unconscionable dealing. But before
turning to that
analysis, we must first address the possibility that these
matters are not, in any event, doctrinal elements or rigid preconditions

we are left with some questions.
The first question concerns whether the portrayal of the common law’s

as presented in

equitable vitiating doctrine was never determined by a jury and that to do so

and inappropriate’ given that the requisite
legal inquiry was not confined to deciding discrete questions of

We will refer to this form of legal reasoning by the shorthand of

Explicit resort to foundational jurisdictional norms to supplement the

Indeed, French CJ has acknowledged that the

A second question concerns the methodological distinction drawn in
between an unconscionable dealing claim and a ‘cause of
action in tort’.
What is meant by
the directive that the three matters relevant to the former claim constitute
mere ‘considerations’ for
the court to assess (as opposed to
‘separate elements’ that must be systematically addressed as if a
were being pleaded)?
Is this what distinguishes the determination of relief pursuant to
unconscionable dealing from the determination of a cause of action
It must surely be necessary to
by addressing the three
‘considerations’ listed by the plurality in
(a) special disadvantage, (b) knowledge and (c) unconscientious exploitation
— separately and systematically, by reason
of basic considerations of
lexical ordering.
In other words, in
relation to an interpersonal exploitation claim: (a) and (b) are preconditions
of (c) — which involves
human conduct and a juridical
conclusion as to that conduct — and (a) and (b) are lexically ordered in
the sense that the need
to show (b) falls away if (a) is not established at all
as an initial threshold matter.
Exploitation requires at least some level of ‘awareness’ by D of
circumstances or a condition capable of being ‘exploited’
no amount of
on the part of D as to C’s circumstances or
condition could lead to a judgment of ‘unconscientious exploitation’
of C if those circumstances, or the relevant condition, do not pass the
equitable threshold for vulnerability to interpersonal exploitation
in the first
place — that is, the threshold of ‘special disadvantage’.
Thus, each of (a), (b) and (c) could be
said to be the scaffolded, properly
sequenced integrants of the phenomenon of interpersonal exploitation itself
— the avoidance
of which, modern courts have declared, lies at the basis
of the jurisdiction. For that reason, why should the considerations not
‘addressed separately’ and in their correct priority order? Hence,
if special disadvantage cannot be established at
the first step, that would,
theoretically, be the end of the inquiry and the claim could be dismissed
without the need to proceed
to the next two
Likewise, even if special
disadvantage could be shown, a failure to prove knowledge of the superior party
thereof would render redundant
the need to proceed to the third
How, then, is the determination of
an unconscionable dealing claim different to the determination of a cause of
action in tort?
One possible explanation is that the difference is in the relative weighting
given to each ‘consideration’ in an unconscionable
Judgment-in-the-round goes beyond
a sequential or checklist inquiry of the sort just described, because the weight
or significance
of each consideration will vary depending on the character of
the other considerations.
For example,
consideration (a) cannot fall out of the picture entirely until considerations
(b) and (c) are addressed, because the
court must consider the interaction of
all three and make an evaluative judgement as to whether, in all of the
circumstances, there
was a sufficient special disadvantage. Lord Walker’s
description of judicial method in relation to the doctrine of proprietary
estoppel illustrates the point: ‘although [the doctrine’s] elements
(assurance, reliance and detriment) may have to be
considered separately they
cannot be treated as watertight
compartments’.
This was because ‘the fundamental principle that equity is concerned to
prevent unconscionable conduct permeates all the elements
of the doctrine. In
the end the court must look at the matter in the
The court must step back
from the logic of the detail, as it were, in order to ascertain the
full picture.
This is especially true of considerations (a) and (b) of the unconscionable
dealing doctrine. They are sequential, but not independent
of each other, as can
itself, where the plurality treated consideration
(b) — that is, D’s knowledge — as not being a major hurdle on
the facts despite expressing some uncertainty as to whether it amounted to
actual knowledge.
This was because the
combination of the naivety of the complainant and the palpable imprudence and
risk of the transaction made the
knowledge element easier to satisfy:
‘[D’s agent] had sufficient appreciation of [C’s]
vulnerability, and the disaster
awaiting him under the mortgages, that his
conduct in procuring the execution of the mortgages is justly described as
unconscientious’.
Although this
statement could be rationalised as a finding of wilful blindness, it seems clear
that the plurality were not concerned
at all with whether there could be
‘an unequivocal finding of actual knowledge’ on the part of the
But how convincing is this as a basis for distinguishing the judicial method
employed in unconscionable dealing from that employed
in a cause of action in
‘tort’ given that instances of judgment-in-the-round occur across
common law, equity and statute?
It could be argued, for example, that the tort
of negligence involves a judgment-in-the-round — a ‘calculus’
with respect to ‘incommensurables’ that necessarily invites
the application of expert judgement on the part of a decision-maker
that are unknowable in advance of
the event upon which the decision-maker is called to
adjudicate.
it be that the adjudication of some torts, at least, is similar to that of
unconscionable dealing?
Perhaps the plurality in
were suggesting that the legal
as well as the weight of the three ‘considerations’
relevant to unconscionable dealing might vary (compared with the
fixed legal
content of the elements of a cause of action in
For example, might the content of
the requisite mental element (which we have argued must be actual knowledge if
the prevention of
‘exploitation’ is accepted as the foundational
norm, but which the plurality in
framed more generally as
‘knowledge of that special
disadvantage’),
vary depending on
the court’s overall assessment of the facts such that constructive
knowledge or even constructive notice
suffices for a finding of
‘unconscientious exploitation’ in some
In other words, was the
plurality’s conclusion that D had ‘sufficient appreciation’ of
C’s special disadvantage,
such that ‘an unequivocal finding of
actual knowledge’ was unnecessary, indicative of a different legal test of
‘knowledge’
due to the severity of the special
disadvantage?
This seems an unduly
complex explanation if the foundational norm is indeed exploitation avoidance,
but it is persuasive if (as we
suggest below) the foundational norm in
should not be restricted to the prevention of exploitation
stricto sensu
It seems even more
troubling to suggest that the legal content of the special disadvantage
consideration can vary across different
cases and contexts. It seems to us that
special disadvantage is necessarily an unwavering
jural threshold
must be crossed on the facts of each and every case. There must always be proof
of a serious inability on the part of the claimant
to conserve their own best
interests in the impugned transaction relative to the other party. Once that
threshold has been met —
and, granted, that will be harder to show in some
contexts than in others — then it is possible that the other features of
an unconscionable dealing inquiry may or may not be easy to make out depending
to which the threshold had been crossed in the individual
case. In other words, there may well be
disadvantage and so in that sense the ‘weight’ of the criterion
may vary in the totality of the overall inquiry. But this
is only in a forensic
rather than in a
substantive sense. In our view, special disadvantage remains a non-negotiable
aspect — hence
requirement
— of the doctrine. Unconscionable
dealing without initial proof of a special disadvantage strikes us as a
impossibility. Obviously, we would not say the same about the superior
party’s ‘awareness’ of a special disadvantage,
but the extent
to which that must be shown, if it must be shown at all, will turn on what one
considers to be the underlying purpose
of the jurisdiction. We discuss this
further in Part IV.
All of this suggests what seems to us to be the most plausible and simplest
explanation of the plurality’s statement in
namely, that it reflects an enduring belief of Australian courts that the
potential of equitable doctrines to regulate relational
dealings should not be
constrained by overly specific and rigid doctrinal criteria or
application.
On this explanation, the
mischief to which the plurality in
were referring was
the danger that the over-enthusiastic and unnecessary statement of broad general
principles of equity in terms of inflexibility may
destroy the vigour which it
is intended to promote in that it will exclude the ordinary interplay of the
doctrines of equity and

compared to other conscience-based doctrines? We can only
speculate. Perhaps it reflects a latent uneasiness with the narrow scope
anti-exploitation rationale and consequent unsatisfactory formulation of the
doctrinal considerations. Perhaps it is part
of a corrective response to the
perceived dominance in the latter part of the 20
Birksian taxonomic thinking, which threatened to eliminate the distinction
between equity and the common law
altogether.
Perhaps it reflects a judicial concern that legal practitioners (particularly

This rhetoric is

described as ‘unfair advantage-taking’. But to say that the elderly

inconsistent with the evidence as it appears in the authorised report of the

transaction-inducing acts of deliberate exploitation, the

‘transactional neglect’ — not predation or
exploitation.

‘public normative role in the protection of the weak

in the context of so-called ‘arm’s-length commercial

the same extent in
connection with gifts as with bargains, but it is not removed altogether in that

‘special disadvantage’, that links D to
C’s plight and which
justifies D ‘suffer[ing] the consequences’ of C’s
vulnerability.
Of course, the linking reason that taints D’s conscience in connection
with an unconscionable dealing claim need not be viewed
as identical as between
contractual and non-contractual transactions, especially on a
judgment-in-the-round style of approach. One
would naturally expect the reason
to be stronger for contracts than for gifts. Proof of naked exploitation is a
very high threshold

hand, ‘transactional

interests of [C]’
— might well be an appropriate minimal standard of
agency-responsible misconduct sufficient for setting aside non-contractual
transactions in the name of the unconscionable dealing
But it is not clear, at least
to us, why it is not also the most appropriate
minimally sufficient
standard for all transaction types.
One can appreciate the strong signalling function that elevated rhetoric such
as ‘exploitation’ and ‘predation’
plays in the present
connection: bargain transactions validly concluded at law should not be seen as
vulnerable to casual destruction
However, it is to be borne in
mind that the
of both exploitative and neglectful uses of
interpersonal power causing transactions is identical; each results in a
reallocation

autonomous consent. All that differs is how much weight the law should be seen
to assign to D’s specific
(and society’s general) interest in
transactional liberty and security at the expense of C’s personal and
proprietary
integrity when what is sought to be upset is a bargain transaction
rather than a gratuitous one — noting that, in unconscionable
cases, it almost always lies within D’s power (and typically at minimal
cost or effort to D) to ensure that C’s
transactional autonomy was
properly protected (hence respected) before entry into the impugned
transaction.
The notion that nothing
less than a full-blown charge of exploitation suffices after a threshold finding
of special disadvantage
is initially made in favour of C, and that
‘heedlessness of, or indifference to, the best interests of [C]’
tip the scales of justice in favour of C, seems unnecessarily ruthless
towards C given the
juridical significance
of the finding of special
disadvantage in C’s favour: that the normal rules of self-reliance and
individual responsibility
in bargaining are suspended and that C can then
reasonably expect D to exercise appropriate restraint in the pursuit of
own self-interest. That is, the exercise of appropriate restraint
renders D’s legal transaction with C consistent with the
minimum standards of fair

Of course, unconscionable
dealing might be more readily inferred in the case of gratuitous transactions
than with genuine contracts,
but this is
not, in our view, because some differential behavioural standard should be seen
to apply when one party deals with another
who is sufficiently known, by the
stronger party, to be operating under a special disadvantage — rather,
‘transactional
neglect’ ought to be the minimal standard of conduct
or norm of interpersonal treatment that is applied across both contractual

the power of the ‘special disadvantage’
requirement as the most
appropriate gateway for sifting out unmeritorious unconscionable dealing claims.
Given the ‘game’
element inherent in free competitive
bargaining,
it is only natural that
‘risk analysis’ will attend and inform the threshold question of
whether a contracting party
should be found to be acting under a ‘special
disadvantage’ in a contractual setting, as opposed to a pure gift scenario
(where no such game element applies).
Bargain transactions are thus less likely than gratuitous ones to be unravelled
for unconscionable dealing because the courts have
made it clear that equitable
principles are not available to redeem someone ‘from the coming home of

And it can be

the practice of the transactionally strong using
the transactionally weak merely
instrumentally as a means or expendable resource to their own

quarrel with that being
a legitimate function of equity in the regulation of significant unofficial
power–vulnerability relationships
in our society?
However, despite four decades of judicial learning (much at the hands of
differently constituted benches of the High Court), many
uncertainties remain in
relation to crucial aspects of the equitable doctrine in its modern contexts and
application: (a) its normative
rationale or foundation, (b) the formulation of
doctrinal proof criteria intended to implement that rationale or foundation and
method of adjudication of specific claims of unconscionable dealing, (c) the
doctrine’s relationship to other exculpatory categories
of the unwritten
law and the statutory ‘unconscionable conduct’ jurisdiction, and (d)
the (in)consistency of curial approach
in applying the doctrine to different
transaction types that are subject to its scrutiny (especially contracts versus
gratuitous transactions). Such uncertainties are not helpful to courts and
legal advisers who must follow the High Court’s (at
times seemingly
discordant)
pronouncements in this field. Hence, we propose that it is time for a
big-picture ‘reset’, primarily through the leadership
of the modern
High Court.
We have speculated as to the reasons for the ongoing uncertainties described
in this article and attributed many of them to a failure
on the part of senior
courts, including the Court in
itself, to robustly engage with the
theoretical core of the unconscionable dealing complaint and hence to then
articulate, in sufficient
detail and with clarity, a normative basis for
intervention. Even allowing for equity’s distinctive adjudicative approach
to that of the common law (à la
we have argued that the
High Court’s increased reliance, post-
, on elevated rhetoric
such as ‘exploitation’, ‘victimisation’ and
‘predation’ to signify the
gravamen of the jurisdiction has caused
the doctrine’s focus to become excessively narrow and the associated proof
accordingly to become too strict to deliver on what we consider ought
to be seen as ‘the real justice of’ the cases of
the type to which
principle originally appeared directed: instances of
‘unfair advantage-taking’ by the strong against the especially
in transactions. Indeed, the current, very narrowly formulated
conception of unconscionable dealing appears antithetic to the judicial

perplexing statement that the bank manager in that case
had ‘simply closed
his eyes to the vulnerability of Mr and Mrs Amadio and the disability which
adversely affected them’,
while also acquitting the manager of
‘dishonesty or moral
obliquity’,
the worst that the
bank seemed to have done towards the elderly couple was simply neglect their
basic autonomy interests when it
was apparent that they were in need of
transactional assistance, advice or explanation which the bank could easily
have, if it had
so chosen, ensured that they received before entry into the

Why should it matter, at least when justifying the minimal rectificatory

merely carelessly
as opposed to deliberately, exploitatively or predatively?

‘values-and-standards’-laden question, although

have been assumed by the High Court (particularly in
so-called ‘arm’s length commercial transaction[s]’ (at

transactions. Even

In our view, to go further and

interference with transactions in the name of equity’s conscience but
licences those who benefit from transactions with the seriously vulnerable to
evade the consequences of their own moral obtuseness.

seeming preference for attenuated knowledge criteria

modification in its application as between
contracts and non-contractual transactions (provided that the ‘special

to the differences
between ‘commercial’ and ‘non-commercial’ relational
situations despite this distinction’s
occasional formalism); and (d) lend itself to more of a
‘judgment-in-the-round’ approach by involving, as it would, a
negligence-type calculus in the circumstances of the individual case (noting
that Australian courts continue to
emphasise the equitable method in contrast to the more rigid and binary
approach engendered by a strict, and hence potentially overly constrictive,
exploitation-based account of the jurisdiction and its animating purpose). In
short, it would render the equitable doctrine of unconscionable
dealing fit for

‘unconscionable’ within the name of the doctrine carries linguistic
connotations of serious misconduct:

It suffices for present purposes to indicate that we
consider the moment of
procurement
(or acceptance) of the impugned
benefit to be the correct point at which to assess the existence of
‘unconscientious advantage-taking’
on the part of the defendant and
that any judgment as to a wrongful ‘enforcement’ or
‘retention’ must refer
from, a wrongful procurement or acceptance at some earlier point in time. This

In that same case, Ward P (at 430 [181]) attempts to avoid this problem by
reading the need
for a ‘predatory’ state of mind
as simply another way of saying that there needs to be unconscientious
exploitation with the requisite knowledge. If that is established,
then it can
be said that there was a ‘predatory’ state of mind in that there was
a deliberate or intentional taking of
advantage of the known special
disadvantage or disability. That is consistent with the recognition that passive
acceptance or retention
of moneys may in some circumstances be sufficient to
amount to unconscionable dealing.
On a close analysis, only Keane J in
) seemed to treat
‘predation’ as an immutable intent requirement of the equitable
doctrine: see especially at 48–9
[118]–[120]. Cf 84–5
[257]–[258] (Nettle and Gordon JJ). At least one commentator has
suggested that the subsequent silence on the predation requirement
appear to be an indirect ratification of what appears to be the current legal
position: that one does
need to establish that the plaintiff had a
predatory state of mind when alleging unconscionability as understood in
Giancaspro (n
(emphasis in original). However, given the explicit recognition of the predation
requirement in
regard it as self-evidently undesirable that the requirement should subsequently
be abandoned by the High Court
sub silentio
: see at 439 [161] (French CJ,
Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell, Gageler and Keane JJ). We suspect that Mark
Giancaspro would agree: see

Recently, as nicely put by the
majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Uber Technologies
), the idea of disadvantage that triggers
the unconscionable dealing jurisdiction is that the claimant is shown to have
been afflicted,
at the moment of transaction formation, by a condition or set of
circumstances that ‘impair[s] ... [their] ability to freely
enter [into]
or negotiate a contract, compromise[s] ... [their] ability to understand or
appreciate the meaning and significance
of the contractual terms, or
both’: at 163 [68] (Abella and Rowe JJ for Wagner CJ, Abella, Moldaver,
Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin
and Kasirer JJ).

These corrective responsibilities are
not in the nature of true ‘duties’, for no right of action to
enforce them belongs
to the disadvantaged party; rather, the party who fails to
so act will be under an equitable ‘disability’ with respect

having the transaction rescinded at the discretion
of the court: cf

Khai Liew and Debbie Yu’s interpretation of Australian law to the effect
that the unconscionable
dealing doctrine imposes a ‘positive duty on D to
a primary duty’: Liew and Yu (n

Gain-Based Damages: Contract, Tort, Equity and Intellectual Property

We mention in passing, but discuss

shifting at the
same moment, or upon proof of the same basic facts, as Deane J

(Deane J, Wilson J agreeing at 468). For example, in
), Brennan J said of the jurisdiction that
‘[o]nce it is proved that substantial property has been given by a donor
after the donee has exploited the donor’s known position of
special disadvantage, an inference may be drawn that the gift is
the product of
the exploitation’: at 632. In other words, his Honour saw the
‘presumption’ operating with respect
to a causal link between
D’s exploitation and C’s entry into the impugned transaction and,
unlike Deane J in
not with respect to the question of whether C’s position of special
disadvantage had in fact been exploited: see at 474,
479–80 (Deane J,
Wilson J agreeing at 468);
), Ward P spoke of ‘at least an
evidentiary onus on the stronger party’ arising upon proof of (a) special
disadvantage,

239–46; Carrera (n
). We do not
want to be taken to suggest that the concept of special disadvantage is always
easy to apply as a matter of fact and
judgement to particular scenarios
presented to the courts for adjudication. On the contrary, the case law in the
field demonstrates
considerable scope for reasonable difference of opinion as
between trial judges and appellate judges and among appellate judges in
application of the conceptual test to the particular facts: see, eg,

Again, we do not engage here with
the question of whether post-formation knowledge of special disadvantage can
influence the court’s
assessment of ‘unconscionability’ in
unconscionable dealing cases. We do not believe that it can, at least under the
principle as presently formulated by the High Court, but there is
emerging dicta to the contrary in recent decisions of the NSWCA:

inconsistency between

to the level of knowledge required for proof of unconscionable dealing. They
state that ‘

derogating from the position set out in

requirements for an unconscionable conduct claim’: Pranay Jha and Alan
Zheng, ‘Constructive Notice
and Passive Retention Scenarios in

(Steward J).
In other words, category (iv)
knowledge on the five-category
scale of knowledge (ie
‘knowledge of circumstances which would indicate the facts to an honest
and reasonable’ person)
would suffice for an unconscionable dealing claim,
as opposed to category (v) knowledge on that scale (ie ‘knowledge of
circumstances
which would put an honest and reasonable
[person] on inquiry’): see
Baden v Société
Générale pour Favoriser le Développement du Commerce et de
l’Industrie en France
[1993] 1 WLR 509
, 575–6 [250] (Peter
Gibson J) (‘
’). For further discussion on the
differences between ‘constructive knowledge’ and ‘constructive
in the present context, see Bigwood,
Exploitative Contracts
) 252–60; Jha and Zheng (n
) 6–7. Giancaspro argues in favour
of constructive knowledge sufficing in the present context, based on a purely
, as opposed to legal, view of what constitutes ‘actual
knowledge’: Giancaspro (n
32–3. See also at 33.
If one turns a blind eye to the possibility that their counterparty is
labouring under a
special disadvantage, they literally do not know if this is true or not. It
is presumed, if the
circumstances should have alerted them to the possibility, that they knew of
the special disadvantage, but this does not displace
the fact that they did not
know in the truest sense.
We suggest caution in relation to such an argument. Not only does the
argument (too quickly) dismiss what is a well-established
equitable technique in
the field, it also overlooks the
important role that ‘legal fictions’ play in the administration
of justice claims: see generally LL Fuller, ‘Legal
Illinois Law Review
(‘Legal Fictions I’); LL
Fuller, ‘Legal Fictions’
(1931) 25(5)
Illinois Law Review
; LL Fuller, ‘Legal Fictions’
(1931) 25(8)
Illinois Law
These articles were republished (in slightly modified form) as a
short book: see Lon L Fuller,
Legal Fictions
(Stanford University Press,
1967). For Fuller, the equitable deeming of ‘wilful blindness’ as
the legal equivalent of
‘actual knowledge’ (ie for the purpose of
the administration of an unconscionable dealing claim) would be an
‘assumptive’
(rather than ‘assertive’) legal fiction:
see Fuller, ‘Legal Fictions I’ (n
) 390. Assumptive fictions are
‘safe’ in the sense that they are facially false (ie the author of
the fiction adopts a
grammatical construction that ‘concedes th[e]
falsity’ involved). Wilful blindness functions
as if it were
legal equivalent of actual knowledge, purporting to state nothing contrary to
legal fact. Of course, legal fictionalisation in
this area is necessary if the
courts are to persist with viewing the jurisdiction as strictly requiring
‘exploitation’
or ‘predation’ — hence, one of us
has in the past argued against the fictionalisation of wilful blindness as the
legal equivalent of actual knowledge in favour of equity’s adoption of the
common law’s concept of ‘inferred knowledge’
in the present
context: see Bigwood,
Exploitative Contracts
) 257–9. However, this previous
argument would need to fall away if the arguments we present in
be accepted. We also note that some commentators have argued that
‘[n]otwithstanding the logical constraints of applying
constructive notice
to active exploitation cases, in our view the doctrine of “constructive
knowledge” may have some
role to play’ in such cases: Jha and Zheng
) 14. Jha and Zheng appear to
assign to ‘exploitation’ a meaning that, in our view, the word
cannot naturally bear, and we take a different view of the distinction
between ‘active’ and
‘passive’ exploitation: see at 10–11. See also

point is unsettled:

Although the High Court’s
comments in
directed at dismissing the claimant’s argument that ‘constructive
’ (rather than ‘constructive knowledge’) sufficed
to require the defendant to disgorge what it had taken from the
claimant, the
Court’s ultimate insistence on actual knowledge or wilful blindness, based
on its interpretation of what Mason
J had meant in
) when he had used the language of
‘knows or ought to know’, must logically exclude the possibility of
‘constructive
’ sufficing as well: Bigwood,

and Gordon JJ understood the idea of
exploitation in the context of the equitable doctrine of unconscionable
bargains’ in
Liew and Yu (n
[258] (Nettle and Gordon JJ) (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). Their
Honours stated that
[u]nconscionable conduct in equity can include the passive acceptance of a
benefit in unconscionable circumstances. Mr Kobelt’s
conduct went beyond
that — he engaged in an active system of conduct that, even if approached
without dishonest motives or
‘degree of good faith’, had the
exploitative and unfair. The requirement is
still ‘victimisation or exploitation’ by a stronger party of a
more vulnerable party.
Even if Liew and Yu are correct as to Nettle and Gordon JJ’s stance
here, it is difficult
to see how their Honours’ view can be consistent with what was said in
at 439–40 [161] (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell, Gageler and
Keane JJ). Still, what was said in
) in terms of the mental requirements of
exploitation is not inconsistent with the exploitation concept being limited by
a criterion
of dishonesty or bad faith, which may be all that Nettle and Gordon
JJ were intending to say here:

We do not deny that legal fictions
are sometimes helpful and necessary in the law, for, as William Blackstone once
famously acknowledged,
they may serve to ‘prevent a mischief, or remedy an
inconvenience, that might result from the general rule of law’: William
Blackstone,
Commentaries on the Laws of England
(Clarendon Press,
1765–69) vol 3, 43. See above n
. In the present context, however, a
paradigm shift away from law’s present reliance on a precept of
non-exploitation to a precept
that is essentially negligence-based would
eliminate the need for fictionalisation altogether: see Bigwood, ‘Still
Unconscionability’ (n

fiction should be vacated in favour of truth: see John

of a distinct mistake

of its consequences, and make
an evaluative judgment whether it would be
unconscionable, or unjust, to leave the mistake uncorrected. The court may and

knowledge of that special disadvantage by the stronger party.

While it is true that the bank had,
in active participation with the Amadios’ son, been selectively
dishonouring cheques drawn
on the already seriously overdrawn accounts of the
son’s company and presented, at times repeatedly, for payment, this was
primarily to ensure the
capacity of the company to continue its building activities in the hope that
it would be able
to trade out of its ‘liquidity crisis’:
) 457–8 (Gibbs CJ), 464–5
(Mason J), 473
(Deane J), 482–3 (Dawson J). Further, Wilson J suggested that the
purpose of the bank’s conduct was to facilitate the
interests of its
wholly owned subsidiary whose interests were closely related to the
Amadios’ son, thereby ‘embroil[ing]
the bank in a conflict of
interest which, in the special circumstances of this case, inhibited the proper
conduct of its banking
at 468. Although the bank’s conduct undoubtedly contributed to the
elderly Amadios’ special disadvantage — for the
Amadios were
consequently misled as to the prosperity of their son’s business and hence
misled as to the risks that they would
be assuming by signing the proposed
mortgage guarantee — none of the judges suggested that the bank’s
practice was part
of a self-conscious (ie predatory) scheme designed to create a
special disadvantage in the parents that the bank could then actively
Even Gibbs CJ, who described the bank’s conduct as constituting ‘not
merely dishonour[ing] ... cheques’
but rather making ‘itself a party
to their selective dishonour, in an endeavour to maintain the facade of
prosperity that the
company, although insolvent, had erected — a facade
which, the bank should have expected, may well have deceived the
[Amadios]’,
ultimately concluded that the bank’s failure to make
disclosure of such ‘unusual features’ of the banker–customer
relationship amounted to a transaction-vitiating misrepresentation,
‘albeit unintended’: at 457–8. That the misrepresentation
innocent variety is inconsistent with any possible implication that the bank
was ever acting in a ‘predatory’ way towards
the Amadios.
