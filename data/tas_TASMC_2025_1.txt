REASONS FOR DECISION GIVEN ORALLY STANTON, DCM
26 March 2025
is an application by the claimant for an order for substituted service of the
claim on the defendant by sending it to his email
address and mobile phone
claim seeks damages of $9,827.65 as a result of a motor vehicle collision which
it is alleged was caused by the defendant’s
negligence.
facts relied on by the claimant to support the order for substituted service are
set out in the affidavit of Alexandra Morris,
the solicitor for the claimant,
affirmed on 10 September 2024. The affidavit of Ms Morris is hearsay to the
extent it relies on statements
made by the process server. Hearsay evidence is
admissible on an interlocutory application: s 75
Evidence Act
evidence establishes that a process server has been unable to serve the claim
personally despite attempts to do so by attending
the defendant’s
residence at 2/10 Burrawong Court, Rocherlea in August 2024.
10 August 2024 the process server knocked multiple times but believed the
defendant was not present. The evidence of that contained
in Ms Morris’s
affidavit is a hearsay recounting of the opinion of the process server. But so
long as such evidence is otherwise
admissible as an opinion, it is permissible
to adduce hearsay evidence of that opinion:
Terranora Group Management Pty
Ltd v Terranora Lakes Country Club Ltd
(unreported NSW SC Austin J, 1
December 1997 BC9706535).
hearsay evidence includes the statement by the process server that on 15 August
2024 a neighbour of the residence confirmed the
property was tenanted. That
statement is second-hand or double hearsay. However, such hearsay evidence is
permitted by
Evidence Act
Remess v Rabe
per Tennent J.
that as it may, on 16 August 2024 the process server received no response from
the inhabitant.
17 August 2024 the process server observed multiple active security cameras but
did not receive a response to knocking.
defendant has previously communicated with the claimant by email on 22 April
2024. The email said,
“Hello my name is Christopher brewer parker pls
gibe [sic] me a call on 0492034815”
. It was sent from the email
address christopherparker2019@gmail.com.
4 June 2024 the claimant emailed a demand notice to the defendant at the email
address christopherparker2019@gmail.com. The defendant
responded saying
“I was not at fault so what can we do now?”
I can make an order for substituted service the claimant must show “proper
cause”: r 42(2)
Magistrates Court (Civil Division) Rules
courts have developed principles governing applications for substituted service.
Proper cause would exist where the requirements
for an order for substituted
service by application of those principles have been met.
requirements were expressed by Mason J (as he then was) in
Foxe v Brown
[1984] HCA 69
(1984) 58 ALR 542
at 546-547 in the following terms.
In general,
for an order for substituted service to be made it must be shown: (a) that the
plaintiff, using reasonable effort, is
unable to effect personal service; and
(b) that the method of substituted service requested is one which is likely to
cause the writ
to come to the knowledge of the defendant (Porter v Freudenberg
[1915] 1 KB 857).
[The standard of diligence or effort required of a plaintiff in seeking out a
defendant],
“however it is expressed, is one of reasonableness so as to
show a practical impossibility of personal service. Furthermore,
the question is
not whether reasonable effort has been shown by the plaintiff over a particular
period but whether at the date on
which the application for substituted service
is made, the plaintiff, using reasonable effort, is unable to serve the
defendant personally.”
the requirements for substituted service expressed in
Foxe v Brown
met, there would be proper cause to order substituted service. However, the
expression “proper cause” is a broad
expression. It is not, on its
ordinary meaning, limited to cases of practical impossibility using reasonable
Ricegrowers’ Co-operative Ltd & Anor v ABC Containerline NV &
[1996] FCA 1663
(1996) 138 ALR 480
, Tamberlin J considered the meaning of the word
“practicable” in the context of a rule granting a power to order
substituted
service. It was held the word should be given a wide meaning. For
similar reasons, in my view the expression “proper cause”
given a broad meaning in this context.
Furthermore,
the expression “proper cause” is used in the context of r 4 of the
Magistrates Court (Civil Division) Rules
which requires proceedings
to be conducted with the least possible delay, in a manner that saves costs and
that is proportional to
the amount of the claim, the importance or complexity of
the proceedings and the financial position of the parties. The claim is
minor civil claim and is therefore required by
s 31AB(1)(f)
Magistrates Court (Civil Division) Act
to be conducted with as
little formality and technicality and with as much expedition as the
requirements of the Act, rules of court
and a proper consideration of the issues
permit. Achieving those purposes may require a more robust and proactive
approach so that
unduly technical and costly disputes about non-essential issues
are avoided:
Expense Reduction Analysts Group Pty Ltd v Armstrong Management
and Marketing Pty Ltd
[2013] HCA 46
(2013) 250 CLR 303.
this case, there is evidence of multiple attendances on the residence of the
defendant. The defendant has not answered the door
in circumstances where he is
clearly aware a claim will be made and he has security cameras which would
enable him to observe unknown
people who might be process servers and avoid them
by not answering the door.
there is no evidence of attempts to identify other locations, such as a
workplace, where the defendant might be served or
attempts to keep the defendant
under surveillance to catch him leaving from or arriving at his residence, there
would be additional
cost involved in such steps. I do not have evidence of what
that cost might be but in the context of a claim in the order of $10,000.00;
is likely those costs would be significant. Service by emailing it to the email
address the defendant has used and the phone number
he has given will also be
significantly less costly than the additional steps that will be required to
serve the defendant personally.
is likely that sending the claim to the defendant at his known email address and
phone number would bring it to his attention.
There is no evidence of an attempt
to serve the defendant by registered post which is permitted by r 40(1)(b) of
Magistrates Court (Civil Division) Rules
. But such service
requires the defendant to collect the mail containing the claim from the post
office. His avoidance of personal
service is likely to extend to not collecting
mail from the claimant’s solicitors or from an unknown sender if it is
to use registered post anonymously. Requiring that step to be taken now
would lead to further delay and it is less likely to bring
the claim to his
attention than sending it to his email and phone number.
I am not satisfied the test of practical impossibility has been met, for the
above reasons I am satisfied that proper cause
has been shown to justify the
making of an order. However, in order to achieve greater certainty that the
claim will be brought to
the defendant’s attention, it would also be
desirable to send it by ordinary pre-paid post to the defendant’s address.
Sending it by that means where there is evidence to support an inference that
the defendant is avoiding service is more likely to
bring it to his attention
because it does not involve an active step on his part to collect it. I will
therefore also require service
by that means.
Magistrates Court (Civil Division) Rules
therefore order as follows.
substitution for service under
Magistrates Court (Civil
Division) Rules
, service of the claim will be validly effected by
sending a copy of the claim and a copy of this order:
email to the email address christopherparker2019@gmail.com;
them to the mobile phone number 0492 034 815; and
sending them by ordinary pre-paid post to 2/10 Burrawang Court, Rocherlea,
Tasmania 7248.
application also seeks an order that the defendant pay the costs of the
application. In my view the question of who should be
responsible for those
costs, should be dealt with after service is effected. I therefore reserve the
question of the costs of this
application.
