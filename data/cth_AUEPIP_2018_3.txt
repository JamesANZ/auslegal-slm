To provide guidance on designing or implementing programs, plans and actions
to improve the condition and trend of values and achieve
an overall net benefit
to the Great Barrier Reef.
Net benefit is an overall improvement in the condition
and/or trend of a Great Barrier Reef value, or those actions which result in
net improvement.
Decisions and actions to reduce pressures and impacts on the Great Barrier
Reef deliver a positive change in the condition and trend
of Great Barrier Reef
values, regardless of whether they occur within or outside the Great Barrier
Reef, including internationally.
Target audience
The target audience for this policy is all stakeholders - government,
Traditional Owners, industry and the community - involved in
programs, plans, ground actions that influence the condition of the Great
Barrier Reef.
Government agencies and authorities should apply this policy when revising or
preparing relevant agreements, policies, plans, strategies
and programs likely
to facilitate or directly contribute to drivers and pressures on the Great
Barrier Reef or actions to improve
the condition or trend of Great Barrier Reef
values. Government agencies and authorities are encouraged to use this policy
to actively
engage with stakeholders in improving the health of the Great
Barrier Reef.
Traditional Owners and stakeholders, including industry, businesses,
conservationists, infrastructure providers and developers –
are encouraged
to consider this policy when developing proposals, guidance material, programs
Researchers and the community can also use this policy to better understand
priorities for the Great Barrier Reef, and focus on areas
for improvement and
measurement.
Like all reefs globally, pressures related to climate change are impacting
the Reef’s resilience and we are witnessing dramatic
system-wide declines
in its condition.
Existing efforts to reduce pressures on the Great Barrier Reef have not been
sufficient to reverse the decline in its health.
These changes, combined with future climate projections, compel us to refocus
our efforts and adopt new approaches to secure the future
of this irreplaceable
Tackling threats to the Reef at their source is critical. Accelerating
actions to address climate change and continuing improvements
in catchment water
quality are fundamental to providing the best possible future for the Reef. At
the same time, we must intensify
our efforts to build the Reef’s
resilience to the disturbances we know to expect in coming decades.
The 2014 Outlook Report identified the four main pressures on the Great
Barrier Reef as:
- climate change (global scale)
- coastal land use change (Great Barrier Reef catchment scale)
- poor water quality from land-based run-off (Great Barrier Reef catchment
- some remaining impacts of fishing (Great Barrier Reef Region – marine
park scale).
Pressures can originate at the local, marine park, catchment and global
scales, and require integration of decision-making at all
space and time scales
to manage their impacts on the Great Barrier Reef.
The impact is not just on the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem, but also impacts
on the cultural values of Traditional Owners; economic
values to the tourism and
fishing industries which rely on a healthy Reef; social and heritage values for
communities along the coast
for whom the Reef is part of their daily life;
together with the broader Australian and international community who consider it
be an irreplaceable icon – belonging to the global community.
Improving management of cumulative impacts, reducing pressures, and
delivering solutions which result in an improvement in the condition
is critical to the future health and resilience of the Reef.
This policy provides a framework for actively engaging stakeholders in
delivering actions and drive cultural change toward a healthy
functional Great
Barrier Reef.
Opportunities to foster net benefit outcomes for the health and resilience of
the Reef are best provided through a diverse range of
approaches, working with
all stakeholders involved with the Reef, and at local, regional, national and
international scales.
Protecting the Great Barrier Reef is a key priority for the Australian and
Queensland governments. The Reef 2050 Plan is the overarching
strategy for
protecting the Great Barrier Reef. The Plan is pivotal to bringing together
actions and coordinating strategies across
government, Traditional Owners,
industry, researchers and the community to protect the Reef and provide for
ecologically sustainable
The Reef 2050 Plan specifically includes the delivery of net benefit in its
primary principles for decision-making that affects the
Great Barrier Reef. The
primary principles for Reef 2050 are:
1. maintaining and enhancing outstanding universal value in every action
2. basing decisions on the best available science
3. delivering a net benefit to the ecosystem
4. adopting a partnership approach to management.
Avoiding and mitigating impacts will remain the primary focus of management
efforts; however, these are not sufficient on their own
to deliver a net
improvement in the condition of Great Barrier Reef values. This policy promotes
net benefit outcomes above and
beyond requirements to avoid, mitigate and
This policy is one of a number of Reef 2050 documents being developed (refer
Practical approaches for addressing the Reef 2050 principles are contained in
the Reef 2050 Policy Guideline for Decision Makers.

for the Great Barrier Reef
provides additional direction for decision-makers
and the broader community.
for operationalising net benefit
Identify relevant Great Barrier Reef values
To ensure decisions effectively deliver an improvement in the condition or
trend of the Reef’s values (Attachment 1), identify
the values that will
benefit from the proposed program, plan or action (refer Attachment 2).
Seek to understand pressures and impacts affecting values
Net benefit actions should consider the range of drivers, pressures and
impacts (refer Attachment 3) affecting values relevant to
your proposed program,
plan or action as this may influence the management approach adopted, and the
design and timing of actions
that deliver a net benefit. Specific effects that
should be considered include the effects of global warming of at least
C above pre-industrial levels and irreversible impacts.
The Reef 2050
Cumulative Impact Management Policy
provides specific
guidance on this principle.
Consider the scale required to deliver the desired positive
Proposed programs, plans or actions should be delivered at a scale relevant
to achieving the desired outcome (Table 1) and consider:
- the number of drivers and pressures impacting on the values and any
interactions
- the cause and effect relationships between drivers, pressures and impacts
on values, should be considered together with any irreversible
- the timeliness of actions
- the effects of a changing climate
- the space and time scales at which drivers, pressures and impacts are
- the scale at which decisions or actions are required to improve the values
or processes (Attachment 4)
- partner and stakeholder collaboration that can strengthen and facilitate
enduring outcomes.
In many cases to achieve an overall net improvement in Great Barrier Reef
values, improvement options may range from local to global

Deteriorating

: Desired outcomes for Great Barrier
Reef values
Consider strategic and innovative approaches
The benefit from decisions to improve the condition and/or trend of the Great
Barrier Reef values is maximised when aligned with strategic
(Attachment 4) that are aimed at improving the condition of Great Barrier Reef
values (Attachment 2 - Tables A1.2 and
Strategic and innovative approaches and interventions should consider
opportunities to restore values or reduce cumulative impacts.
For ecosystems,
these should be targeted at critical ecological functions or key species that
support ecological processes.
Strategic approaches should consider a variety of options and be implemented
to manage uncertainty, address risk (Attachment 5) and
facilitate learning and
adaptive management. New and novel approaches that target restoration or deliver
improvements are more able
to be considered if actions are supported by
strategies designed to manage the risk created by uncertainty.
Strategic approaches that facilitate coordination and collaboration with
industry, government or community groups with a special interest
in an area, and
that deliver multiple outcomes for environmental values, should be
encouraged.
Use coordinated and collaborative approaches to improve effectiveness
of programs
Wherever possible, actions should:
- Adopt coordinated and collaborative approaches to align efforts and share
information between Traditional Owners and stakeholders
(such as industry and
science organisations)
- Support community groups with a special interest in an area to identify the
condition and trend of locally significant values, establish
locally relevant
baselines and desired outcomes for values, consistent with Table 1, and engage
in the delivery of programs, plans
and actions
- Integrate and support targeted efforts to facilitate efficient and
effective delivery of agreed decisions at the most relevant scale,
maximise the net benefit across multiple actions.
Opportunities to foster net environmental benefit outcomes are best provided
through a diverse range of approaches, working with all
stakeholders across the
Reef, and at local, regional, national and international scales. This includes
- planning mechanisms (e.g. Plans of Management and Site Management
Arrangements)
- stewardship initiatives (e.g. Reef Guardians program)
- partnerships (e.g. Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan)
- programs (e.g. natural resource management programs, Joint Field Management
- international agreements (e.g. Paris Climate Agreement).
Implementation
Implementation of this policy will be staged, recognising the need to develop
specific guidance to promote coordination, alignment
and communication for
- government agencies
- industry sectors
- decision-makers and
- the broader community.
This policy is to be read in conjunction with the Reef 2050 Policy Guideline
for Decision Makers which illustrates a wide range of
actions designed to manage
drivers and pressures on the Reef.
Where legislation allows, decision-makers should consider opportunities to
provide net benefits to the Great Barrier Reef within these
and other relevant
decision–making processes.
This Policy has been developed in parallel with the Reef 2050 Plan Cumulative
Impact Management Policy and guidance for Good Practice
Management under the
overall governance framework for the Reef 2050 Plan (Figure 2).
The effectiveness of this policy will be reviewed and evaluated in line with
the five yearly Outlook Report and review of the Reef
2050 Plan. Effective
implementation of a net benefit approach should deliver a long-term positive
change or trend in condition of
values as reported on in the Outlook Report and
Reef 2050 Plan five yearly review.
Definitions
Actions and activities are used to describe projects and project parts under
Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999

. For this policy actions are
used, assuming activities comprise action, or a subset of an action. Also
includes development proposals
and/or planning actions.
Adaptive capacity
The ability for a component of the environment to adapt to impacts to
maintain or improve its condition. Includes the environmental
component’s
ability to recover, reorganise or build capacity to learn and adapt in between
Adaptive management
A systematic process for continually improving management practices through
learning from the outcomes of previous management. It

highest priority is given to avoiding impacts on the environment.
measures must consider prudent and feasible alternatives to a proposed action.
Potential impacts that cannot be avoided
must be minimised. Mitigation measures
must consider direct, indirect and cumulative impacts, and account for the
likely spatial
and temporal scales of impacts across the duration of the
proposed activity. Offsets compensate for the residual adverse impacts
action on the environment.
Baseline condition
A description of existing conditions to provide a starting point (e.g.
pre-project condition of biodiversity) against which comparisons
can be made
(e.g. post-impact condition of biodiversity), allowing the change to be
quantified. Baseline conditions for the Marine
Park are measured from its World
Heritage Declaration in 1981.
Biodiversity elements
Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth. It includes all living things
and the way they interact with each other and their environment.
Region’s biodiversity values which underpin matters of national
environmental significance include:
- Great Barrier Reef habitats
- terrestrial habitats that support the Great Barrier Reef
Community benefit
The interconnectedness of people and their environment as reflected in the
definition of ‘environment’ under the EPBC
Act and GBRMP Act and as
defined in this document.
Consequential impacts
Are a form of ‘indirect’ impact resulting from further actions
(including actions by third parties) that are made possible
or are facilitated
by implementation of the activity. For example, a port expansion may result in
an increase in shipping activity
which may bring with it a suite of
consequential impacts (e.g. anchoring impacts, displacement of uses).
Cumulative impacts
Cumulative impacts are defined as the interaction of effects between one or
more impacts and past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
future pressures.
Cumulative impact assessment
Takes into account direct, indirect and consequential impacts and the
incremental and compounding effects of these impacts over time,
including past,
present and reasonably foreseeable future pressures.
Decisions are not limited to regulatory decision-making. Decisions include
developing, revising or implementing relevant agreements,
policies, plans,
strategies and programs; implementing legislation as part of the Great Barrier
Reef planning and assessment processes;
prioritising and undertaking on-ground
An overarching cause that can drive change in the environment. It can affect
the environment indirectly by changing the way people
undertake activities that
affect the environment (indirect drivers) or by directing changing conditions in
the environment itself
(direct drivers). Examples include climate change,
economic growth and population growth.
Ecological processes and functions
Ecological processes comprise a number of functions including: microbial
processes, particle feeding, primary production, herbivory,
symbiosis, recruitment, reef building, competition and connectivity. Key
ecological processes of the Great Barrier Reef
are listed in Table A2.2. Changes
in these processes can have direct and indirect effects on other species such as
depletion of prey
or predators and the delivery of ecosystem services.
Ecosystem services are the benefits provided to humans through the
transformations
of resources (or environmental assets, including land, water,
vegetation and atmosphere) into a flow of essential goods and services
clean air, water, and food 12 (Ecosystem services definition cited in Department
of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the
Arts (2009). Ecosystem Services: Key
Concepts and Applications, Occasional Paper No 1, Department of the Environment,
Water, Heritage
and the Arts, Canberra).
Ecologically sustainable use
The principles of ecologically sustainable use are defined in section 3AA of
the GBRMP Act as:
a. decision-making processes should effectively integrate both long-term and
short-term environmental, economic, social and equitable
considerations
b. the precautionary principle
c. the principle of inter-generational equity—that the present
generation should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity

d. the conservation of biodiversity and ecological integrity should be a
fundamental consideration in decision-making
e. improved valuation, pricing and incentive mechanisms should be

Heritage values
The Region’s heritage values, which underpin matters of national
environmental significance, are grouped into five broad categories:
Indigenous heritage values
: the heritage values of a place
that are of significance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons in
accordance with their
practices, observances, customs, traditions, beliefs or
other heritage values
: a place’s natural and cultural
environment having aesthetic, historic, scientific or social significance, or
other significance,
for current and future generations of Australians
world heritage values
: the natural heritage and cultural
heritage of a property that is internationally recognised as being of
outstanding universal value
national heritage values
: the values of a place that are of
national significance as recognised through placement on the National Heritage
Commonwealth heritage values
: the values of a place that are
specified in its placement on the Commonwealth Heritage List.

to a hazard; may be positive or negative.
Matters of national environmental significance
Those matters as defined in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity
Conservation Act
Net benefit
A decision or action which results in a net improvement to the condition
and/or trend of a Great Barrier Reef environmental value
or process as described
in Attachment 2– Tables A2.1 and A2.2.
Outstanding universal value
Cultural and/or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend
national boundaries and to be of common importance for
present and future
generations of all humanity. Outstanding universal value is distributed
throughout the entire Great Barrier Reef
World Heritage Area. The relationship
between outstanding universal value and Great Barrier Reef values is described
in Attachment
Pressure (Threats)
An activity or group of activities that cause an impact on a value.
Includes programs, plans, decisions and on-ground actions.
Reference condition
Assessment of the reference condition and trend of Great Barrier Reef values
(taking into account past and present effects) is described
in Attachment 1 and
values are benchmarked and graded every five years through the Outlook Report.
Reference scenario
What is likely to have occurred in the absence of management response. The
reference scenario is based on the current condition and
trend, taking into
account reasonably foreseeable future pressures. Grading statements for
condition are described in Attachment
1 – Table A1.1.
The ability of an environmental component to cope with change or exposure and
remain in a desirable functioning state. It includes
the ability to absorb
impacts and continue functioning, and recover, reorganise or build capacity to

31000:2009 ) as “effect of uncertainty on objectives.”
policy/guideline, risk relates to uncertainty as to whether the objectives of
the policy can be achieved i.e. achieving
desired states for Great Barrier Reef
Sensitivity
The degree to which a component of the environment is responsive to a
specific impact.
How serious a consequence would be if it occurred; the degree of degradation
that would occur to the value if that consequence occurred.
Refers to values and ecological processes as described in Attachment 2,
Tables A2.1 and 2.2. Foremost, healthy and resilient ecosystems
are fundamental
to the protection of biodiversity and heritage values and the community benefits
they support.
Vulnerability
The susceptibility of environmental components to degradation from impacts.
Vulnerability is a function of the environmental component’s
sensitivity and adaptive capacity.
Zone of influence
The area or spatial extent in which an activity or pressure has the potential
to impact a component of the environment. The ‘zone
of influence’ or
‘zone of impact’ is used to describe the area and temporal scale of
effect at which impacts (such
as from an action, project, plan or program) are
occurring and the scope of response available or required to manage impacts. The
zone of influence includes the assessment of the boundaries to biological and
life processes needed to encompass the spatial and
temporal extent of impacts
that influence the condition of environmental values, ecosystem processes and
socio-ecological systems
throughout the period during which impacts of the
decision will occur. The zone of influence can be described in three parts:
- zone of ecological influence - the area or spatial extent in which an
activity or pressure directly impacts a component of the environment
- zone of system influence - the area or spatial extent in which an activity
or pressure has an indirect or consequential impact on
a component of the
environment, recognising the boundaries to biological and life processes extend
beyond the direct impact of the
- zone of management influence – which includes the scope of response
encompassing direct and indirect impacts and other past,
present pressures and
threats affecting values and processes.

1: Great Barrier Reef Outlook report condition and trend assessment approach
(adapted from page 9 of the Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report 2014)
A set of assessment criteria is used to analyse available evidence. For
example, the assessment of biodiversity uses two assessment
habitats to support species and populations of species or groups of species.
Within each assessment criterion there
are multiple assessment components. A
series of statements is then used to standardise the allocation of grades for
all components
examined in an assessment, as well as the overall grade for the
Grading statements (refer to Table A1.1)
The grade allocated is a ‘grade of best fit’, based on a
qualitative assessment of the available evidence for the Region.
It is not a
comparison of the Region in relation to other tropical ecosystems around the
world. The statements developed for assessing
most heritage values are based on
those used in the Australian State of the Environment Report and Strategic
Assessment draft report.
Those for the assessment of world and national heritage
values are adapted from a grading system developed by the International Union
for Conservation of Nature to assess the outstanding universal value of natural
world heritage sites. One aspect considered in grading
the condition of heritage
values is the degree to which those values have been recorded and identified.
This recognises the important
role an understanding of heritage plays in its
protection.
Trend and confidence
The approach to grading is refined by including an indication of trend and
confidence, similar to the Australian State of the Environment
Report and the
Strategic Assessment report. There are four categories for trend: improved,
stable, deteriorated and no consistent
trend. The category of ‘no
consistent trend’ is applied to a component when the available information
is too variable
to establish a trend, for example where there is strong
variation across broad areas or across species within a group. The terms
‘improved’ and ‘deteriorated’ are replaced with
‘increased’ and ‘decreased’ in assessments
of benefits,
impacts, threats and risks. Similar to the Australian State of the Environment
Report and the Strategic Assessment report,
the level of confidence in each
assessment of grade and trend is rated. The categories used are:
- adequate high quality evidence and high level of consensus
- limited evidence or limited consensus
- inferred, very limited evidence.
For components where the confidence level is ‘inferred, very limited
evidence’, the assessment is based on knowledge from
managing agencies,
Traditional Owners, topic experts and informed stakeholders (expert
elicitation).
Evidence used
The evidence used in the Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report is derived from
existing research and information sources. It is drawn
from the best available
published science based on:
- relevance to the required assessments
- duration of study
- extent of area studied
- reliability (such as consistency of results across different sources, peer
review and rigour of study).

‘outstanding universal value’
A property is considered to be of ‘outstanding universal value’
if it meets one or more of 10 world heritage criteria
and is inscribed on the
World Heritage List. To be deemed to be of outstanding universal value ‘a
property must also meet the
conditions of integrity and/or authenticity and must
have an adequate protection and management system to ensure its
safeguarding’.
Effective future protection of the Great Barrier
Reef’s outstanding universal value, together with the seven matters of
environmental significance, relies on the integration of management
measures and a systems approach to the protection of values and

3: Drivers of change, pressures and impacts on the Great Barrier Reef
Drivers are overarching causes that can drive change in the environment
(State of the Environment, 2011; Strategic Assessment Report,
2014) and have
also been referred to as underlying causes of change in the environment (Outlook
Report, 2014). For the purposes
of this policy and the Reef Integrated
Monitoring and Reporting Program, it is proposed to adopt six drivers of change
for the Great
Barrier Reef system:
1. Climate change
2. Population growth
3. Economic growth
4. Technological developments
5. Societal attitudes
6. Governance systems
Pressures and impacts are mechanisms that exert a change force (either
positive or negative) on a value. Put another way, pressures
and impacts are
the change mechanisms (e.g. processes or activities) that result from drivers.
For the purposes of this policy,
pressures are defined consistent with the
Outlook Report ‘threats’ (2014) and the Strategic Assessment Report
(2014). The green boxes in Table A1.1 are pressures and
impacts of particular relevance in the Great Barrier Reef catchment. Refer

5: Risks to Great Barrier Reef values as reported in the Great Barrier Reef
Outlook Report
The Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report provides a full description of threats
and risks. The Outlook Report has a standard set of criteria
to allow the
comparison of different types of threats within the one risk assessment, based
on the likelihood and consequence of
each threat. The likelihood and consequence
of each predicted threat are ranked on five-point scales, as described

Marine Park permission system
Determine sensitivity and exposure
Determine whether a risk event may occur. A risk event is when an activity
exposes a value to hazard to which that value is sensitive.
An event only occurs
if two things are true:
• The value is
to that hazard; and
• The value may be
to that hazard.
sensitivity
– is the value sensitive to the hazard,
that is, likely to change in response to the hazard, creating an impact?
• Low sensitivity – Value is not known to be affected by the
• Medium sensitivity – Value is known to be slightly affected by
the hazard (sub-lethal effects)
• High sensitivity – Hazard has well-documented negative impacts
on the value (lethal effects are possible)
• Uncertain – There is a high degree of scientific uncertainty,
or no knowledge about the value’s sensitivity.
– is the value likely to be exposed to the
• Low exposure – The value is not known to occur in the zone of
impact, or has been reported as a rare, aberrant visitor.
There are no reasons
to believe that the value occurs in the zone of impact.
• Medium exposure – The value has occasionally been reported in
the zone of impact, or there is reason to believe that
the value occurs in the
zone of impact.
• High exposure – The value is commonly reported or known to
occur in the zone of impact.
• Uncertain - There is a high degree of scientific uncertainty, or no
knowledge about the value’s occurrence or range.
Use figure A5.4 to determine whether a risk event needs to be considered in
the assessment.

assessment?
SENSITIVITY 
Case by case decision
Case by case decision
Analyse the risks
Analyse the likelihood and consequence of how a risk may affect a value.
These effects are called “impacts.”
A “risk rating” is calculated based on:
• the consequence of the impacts to a value (expressed in terms of
severity) if a risk event occurs and
• the likelihood of that risk event occurring (expressed in terms of
probability or frequency).
The risk rating provides a measure of the level of risk, which is then used
to decide the acceptability of that risk and to establish
management priorities
for treating the risk.
Standard descriptions for consequence and likelihood, based on a five-point
scale, allow the comparison of different types of hazards
within a single risk
assessment.
Determine the possible impacts
For each event and hazard, list the potential impacts to relevant values that
might reasonably be expected to occur.
Impacts are distinct effects on some aspect of a value. They are different
from consequences (which are considered in the next step);
a consequence is the
overall outcome on the condition or trend of the value.
Consider the full range of values that might be impacted. For example, death
of a dolphin may impact not only on the biophysical value
of dolphins, but also
on social or Indigenous heritage values associated with dolphins.
Where quantitative information is available, this should be used to more
accurately identify the potential impacts.
Determine the severity of consequences
This step moves from impacts on an aspect of a value to considering the
consequence – that is, the overall outcome on the condition
or trend of
Table A2.3 provides a standardised description of consequences for different
general categories of values. These generic descriptions
may be supplemented
• The individual
assessment guidelines
provide consequence tables unique to specific
• Expert advice may be used to develop a consequence table for a
specific value, where Value Assessment Guidelines are not yet
Consider each value that may experience consequences, and how the severity of
these consequences differ depending on the value.
Consider at what scale the consequence may occur:
• Local scale – A single bay, reef or island; generally an area
less than 100 square kilometres
• Regional scale – A Natural Resource Management region
• Widespread scale – Overall condition of the value across
multiple regions or across the entire Marine Park; generally,
affecting 50 per
cent or more of the value’s extent.
Consider the vulnerability of the value, or of sub-groups within that value.
If there are populations, groups or individuals that
are particularly vulnerable
to a certain impact, the consequence level will typically be higher. In
particular:
• impact to different life histories/processes
• the dependency of values on impacted resources
• the current condition and trend in condition of values
• relevant health thresholds
• the ability of the value to adapt to the new impact to maintain or
improve its condition, such as the rate of recovery between
disturbances, based
on current condition or rate of change and reorganising of a system to a
desirable functioning state.
