Press Council seeks Government commitment to open and
transparent government
The Chair of the Australian Press Council, Professor David Weisbrot, called
on the Turnbull government today to demonstrate its commitment
to open and
transparent democracy by immediately providing the Office of the Australian
Information Commissioner (OAIC) with sufficient
resources to fulfil its mission
under existing law.
Professor Weisbrot also called on the government to send a high level
delegation to the Open Government Partnership’s Global
Summit in Mexico
City, to be held on 27-29 October.
“Australia used to be one of the world’s leaders in promoting
open government and freedom of information, along with Scandinavian
countries,” Prof Weisbrot said. “Now, there appears to be little
interest in federal government circles, which is a great
shame as these issues
are more important than ever.
"These are not only critical issues for all of us as citizens, but they are
of particular importance in underpinning the work of the
free press, which is
reliant upon open access to government information, minimising secrecy laws and
encouraging whistleblowers who
disclose government or corporate malpractice.
“The lack of commitment to our own OAIC is a very discouraging sign
— and with the Global Summit to commence in days,
we are still waiting for
any sign of interest in that meeting by the Turnbull government or the federal
Opposition”
The OAIC has been badly run down in recent years, with a single commissioner
(the former Privacy Commissioner) on a short-term contract
filling the roles
designed by Parliament to be covered by three senior statutory officers.
There was little evidence at the recent Senate Estimates hearings that
Attorney-General George Brandis is planning to restore the
budgetary and human resources, nor was any alternative strategy canvassed for
ensuring that Australia maintains a robust
freedom of information system, open
government and privacy protection.
Australia made a commitment in May 2013 to join the Open Government
Partnership (OGP), but has been inactive ever since, while most
other nations
have been busy designing and implementing government Action Plans in
collaboration with civil society organisations,
Prof Weisbrot pointed out. The
OGP consists of 66 member countries and aims to secure concrete commitments from
governments to promote
transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and
harness new technologies to strengthen governance.
“Open and transparent government is one of the key foundation stones of
liberal democratic government,” Prof Weisbrot
said. “Free access to
data and documents held by government — with some obvious exceptions for a
small amount of information
that is security sensitive or otherwise clearly
inappropriate for release — is essential for ensuring good policy making
sound administrative decision making, as well as for exposing and preventing
corruption”.
