FOR DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL
Introduction
reasons relate to the application for costs made by the respondent for the
applicant's unsuccessful application for review
of the decision of the
respondent on 6 May 2024 to issue two notices in relation to a dilapidated house
on Lot 273 (No. 6) Keever
applicant was self-represented in the matter, the respondent had legal
representation.
respondent applied to the Tribunal pursuant to
State Administrative Tribunal Act 2004
(WA) and r 42A of
State Administrative Tribunal Rules 2004
(WA) for an order
that the applicant pay a portion of the respondent's costs totalling $8,265.51
including GST. incurred in these
proceedings.
respondent's grounds of the application for costs are
the Applicant's
case was wholly without merit;
the Applicant
conducted the proceedings unreasonably, in that he pursued the application to a
contested final hearing but did not
adduce relevant or helpful evidence at the
hearing; and
cost orders are,
in all the circumstance, fair and reasonable.
applicant opposes the orders sought by the
respondent.
Mr Kessell argues that it was not his choice but the choice of the
respondent to take the matter to final hearing rather than varying
the notice to
allow him time to undertake the works necessary. He also argues that it was the
choice of the respondent to seek legal
representation, and he says that the
financial liability therefore rests with the
respondent.
The discretion in relation to costs
application for review was brought under
Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act
approach to costs in the Tribunal is well established and recently explained in
Danni and Town of Cambridge
[2023] WASAT 123
the starting point is that each party will bear their own costs in a review
proceeding,
satisfied that it is appropriate to make an order for costs, I retain a residual
discretion to do so.
The making of a costs order in the Tribunal generally flows from a finding that
the conduct of a party is unreasonable.
JA (Martin CJ, Corboy J agreeing) in
, explained
Although s 87(2) does not in terms say that the discretion [to make a costs
order] is to be exercised if it is fair and reasonable
in all the circumstances
of the case to do so, the judicial nature of the exercise and the scheme of the
SAT Act indicates that,
broadly speaking, that is the legislative

), the Tribunal stated at [38] that:
... In the unusual event that an order for costs is made by the Tribunal, the
Tribunal's obligation to minimise the costs to parties
will be reflected in the
costs assessed by the Tribunal as recoverable. That approach reflects an
expectation that representatives
of parties before the Tribunal will approach a
proceeding in a way that minimises costs to their clients. If clients choose to
proceedings before the Tribunal in a way which substantially increases
costs for them, it will be a rare case where that increase
in costs will be
recoverable through a favourable costs order.
Tribunal's considerations
coming to my decision on costs, I have taken into consideration the submissions
of the respondent dated 30 June 2025, 18 July
2025 and the schedule of costs
dated 18 July 2025, and the submissions by the applicant dated 1 August
respondent was aware that the applicant was to be self­represented in the
hearing process and chose to be legally represented
as is its right. The costs
associated with that legal representation are therefore not readily costs that
are to be borne by the
applicant in this matter unless I find that the applicant
has conducted himself unreasonably.
find it is neither unusual nor unreasonable for a party to be
self­represented in a review proceeding. My intention in pointing
ways in which the applicant may have further assisted the Tribunal in
the reasons for the decision on the review application,
was to provide an
explanation for the applicant to assist him in understanding how I had come to
my decision.
do not accept that the applicant was unreasonable in prosecuting his case given
his position of wanting to retain his house on
the lot, contrary to the notices
issued. The applicant's right of review is enshrined in legislation pursuant to
s 137(ii) of the
HMP Act. I find that the materials and submissions made by the
applicant were relevant and genuinely attempted to enable and assist
Tribunal in understanding his case, even though he did not call expert evidence.
do not find that the case was wholly without merit as asserted by the respondent
or that the applicant conducted himself unreasonably
in the hearing.
overall length of time this issue has been ongoing has also been raised by the
respondent as a concern, and I agree it is considerable.
However, I do not
believe this decision on costs turns on the duration of the issue. Nor do I
need to make a finding that attributes
fault to one party or the other in that
regard without detailed knowledge of both parties' reasons for not resolving the
matter more
expeditiously.
all the reasons above, I find the applicant's conduct in the prosecution of his
case is not unreasonable and that this case is
not an unusual or exceptional
occurrence that warrants consideration of costs being awarded against the
applicant. The Tribunal
concludes that the correct and preferable decision in
this case is that the respondent's application for costs be dismissed and makes
the following orders.
The Tribunal orders:
respondent's application for costs dated 30 June 2025 against the applicant is
I certify that the preceding paragraph(s)
comprise the reasons for decision of the State Administrative Tribunal.
