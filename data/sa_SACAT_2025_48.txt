This decision considers an application to the Tribunal for determination of
whether the agreement between the parties meets the definition
of a residential
tenancy agreement pursuant to
Residential Tenancies Act 1995
The applicants submitted that the agreement was a residential tenancy
agreement such that the Tribunal could resolve their dispute
respondents. The applicants provided submissions in support of their application
that the first applicant conceded were
prepared using artificial intelligence
The Tribunal considered whether there was rent payable under the agreement
such that the exclusion under
of the Act did not apply, and whether
Residential Parks Act 2007
would apply in relation to the agreement.
Held, dismissing the application:
The parties
agreed that no money had been paid for rent and therefore, the Act cannot apply
to the agreement from which this dispute
arises and the Tribunal cannot hear and
determine the application;
Residential Parks Act 2007
applies only to agreements between a resident
of a residential park and the park owner. Clearly, the land in question here was
a residential park in accordance with the definition under that Act;
The Tribunal
considers that providing a written submission which grossly misrepresents the
effect of statutory provisions and cites
non-existent cases in support could
fall foul of either

REASONS FOR DECISION
Dismissal of application for lack of jurisdiction

Findings of the Tribunal
applicants, Mr Blackmore and Ms Cederman, reside or resided on land owned by Ms
Comley and Mr Smyth. The application arises from
a dispute between the parties.
The application, lodged on 13 May 2025, states that the applicants request that
“SACAT urgently:
Issue an order
preventing the landowners from disconnecting our water and electricity
Recognise the
validity of our original agreement including the three month notice clause
Support our
family in maintaining access to basic utilities until we can transition safely
off the property within the agreed time
Correspondence
between the applicants and the respondents indicated that the respondents denied
that the agreement was a residential
tenancy agreement. The applicants lodged
several submissions prior to the hearing, including a submission giving reasons
Tribunal should accept that the agreement is a residential tenancy
agreement and should exercise jurisdiction.
application is made under the
Residential Tenancies Act 1995
which only gives the Tribunal powers to deal with two types of agreement:
residential tenancy agreements and rooming house
agreements. The residential
arrangement described by the applicant self-evidently does not involve a rooming
house. It follows that,
unless the applicant resides or resided on the
respondent’s property under a residential tenancy agreement, the Tribunal
no jurisdiction, or in plainer terms, has no lawful powers to determine the
dispute and make orders.
The submission concerning jurisdiction
Mr Blackmore’s submission titled “
Legislative Analysis –
SACAT Jurisdiction & Tenancy Recognition
”, he cited three
provisions of the Act and one provision of the
South Australian Civil
Administrative Tribunal Act 2013
. As “Supporting Case
Law”, the submission cited three Tribunal cases, one each from New South
Wales, Victoria and South
Australia. These references were all in support of his
arguments that the relevant agreement was a residential tenancy agreement
therefore within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. On scrutiny of the
legislation and the cases, I concluded that the legislative
provisions did not
express the things ascribed to them by the submission. For example, the
submission asserted that
of the Act “
prohibits the unlawful
disconnection of essential services like water and electricity and provides a
statutory right to redress
actually provides that a
tenant may serve a notice on the landlord to terminate a periodic tenancy
without specifying a ground.
scrutiny of the cases cited showed that none of the three exists. The citations
belonged to cases unrelated to residential tenancy
agreements and between
parties with names different from those in the submission. My search of the
relevant Tribunal databases on
corresponding party names.
The jurisdiction question
submission asserts that paragraphs 5(1)(d) and 5(1)(e) of the Act “
not apply where the nature of the arrangement involves exclusive possession,
permanence, and ongoing mutual obligations
”. Paragraph 5(1)(e) of the
Act relates to the agreements commonly known as rent-to-buy agreements and I do
not consider it
to have any relevance. However, paragraph 5(1)(d) of the Act is
centrally relevant and, in my view, determinative:
5—Application
(1) This Act does not apply
(d) an agreement conferring a right to occupy premises for the purpose of
residence but under which no rent is payable; or
An agreement under which families exchange houses for an agreed period would not
be a residential tenancy agreement if no rent were
payable under the agreement.
initial informal written agreement referred to “Chris and Holly to work on
the certified organic farm in mutual exchange
for living, while electricity,
water and insurance costs, to be paid by Chris and Holly in either hours or
money”. The parties
agreed that, as a simple fact, no money had been paid
definition of residential tenancy agreement in s 3 refers only to
‘valuable consideration” in exchange for the right
to occupy, and
labour would certainly constitute valuable consideration. However, the provision
quoted above uses the word “rent”.
At common law, rent might be
payable by any form of valuable consideration, but in
McColl v Hearse
[2016] SACAT 38
, President Parker held that for the purposes of the Act,
“rent” has a narrower meaning than in the common law, and means
to Mr Blackmore’s submission, the Act does not provide an exception to
this exclusion, in any circumstances. The conclusion
is inescapable that the
Act cannot apply to the agreement from which this dispute arises, and the
Tribunal cannot hear and determine
the application.
Blackmore, in writing and orally, submitted that the Tribunal should deal with
the dispute applying principles of common law, equity,
natural justice and good
will. Whereas a superior court automatically has power to deal with
applications, subject only to the
Constitution
, tribunals are creatures of
statute. They exist only to the extent that statute law creates them, and they
may only exercise powers
that a statute gives them. The relevant statute here,
Residential Tenancies Act 1995
, prevents the Tribunal from exercising
any powers in relation to this agreement.
parties may wish to seek independent legal advice in relation to the
Inapplicability of
Residential Parks Act 2007
note that the applicants resided on the respondent’s land in a dwelling (a
tiny house) that they say they own. This circumstance
would also rule out any
applicants a right to occupy
but would be conferring a right to
. Although alternative Acts were not raised in the
submissions, this appears analogous to a residential park site agreement under
Residential Parks Act 2007
, where the right conferred by the
agreement (in exchange for valuable consideration) is to occupy the site and to
install or locate
a dwelling on it.
that Act applies only to agreements between a resident of a “residential
park” and the “park owner”.
A residential park is defined as
land used for a complex of dwellings with residential park tenancy agreements
and/or sites with
residential park site agreements. Clearly, the land in
question here was not a residential park.
Comments regarding Mr Blackmore’s submission
questioned Mr Blackmore as to how he had prepared his submission regarding
research and speaking with
RentRightSA. I repeated my question, and after his response commenced in the
same way, I expressed my
near-certainty that the submission was the product of
ChatGPT or similar artificial intelligence software. Mr Blackmore conceded
South Australian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013
, permits dismissal of applications in certain circumstances. In relation to
the submission in question, I commented during the hearing
on two such
circumstances: abuse of process and attempting to deceive another party or the
Tribunal. Providing a very detailed written
submission which grossly
misrepresents the effect of statutory provisions and cites non-existent cases in
support could well fall
foul of either provision.
considered his response and on reflection, I accept that Mr Blackmore was not
consciously doing either of those things but
rather was enlisting the support of
a tool without proper regard to, or perhaps awareness of, its limitations in
this respect.
Orders of the Tribunal
application is dismissed.
