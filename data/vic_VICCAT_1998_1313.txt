APPEARANCES
M/s Rebecca West, Town Planner represented the Responsible Authority.
Mr Rob Milner, Planning Consultant represented the Planning Applicant.
Objectors, Mr Con Mydaras and M/s Shirley Murdoch appeared in person.
SUBMISSIONS
Written submissions were presented by M/s West, Mr Mydaras and Mr Milner.
These are on file together with attachments and photographs
as a record from
the Hearing.
M/s West outlined the locality and site, zoning and planning scheme provisions,
the application background, the proposal and assessed
it against the provisions
of the Good Design Guide under the headings of density, infrastructure,
neighbourhood character, site layout
and landscaping, energy efficiency,
building envelope, visual and acoustic privacy, car parking and vehicle access,
private and communal
open space and finally commented on the ground of
Mr Mydaras undertook his assessment of the proposal against the Good Design
Guide and in fourteen pages pointed out his interpretation
of deficiencies. He
concluded with:
"This site is at the entry and exit point of a laneway that services Shops
and Offices in Bay Street, Brighton. This laneway belongs
to the people of
Brighton and is not part of Private land as the developer states. The Title
should be amended to depict the real
Approx 50 cars are parked within the length of the laneway.
Currently one driveway is provided from the development site to the laneway.
This causes no one detriment. The lane also services
cars and trucks loading
goods and unloading Goods. Two "No Standing signs" are located along the site.
These were put there to keep
this entry clear.. The extra width also enables
cars to pass each other when entering or leaving. This area is also sometimes
as a loading zone although not officially listed as such.
The proposal has too many driveways at this "Gateway" to the commercial
zone. The proposal has not done a Site Analysis Plan or a
Site Response Plan.
This is in complete rebuttal of the Good Design Guide. The Proposal has
completely ignored its neighbours.
The proposal is contrary to the intent and
spirit of the Good Design Guide. The site is not a corner site as the council
and should not be treated as one. It is a great overdevelopment of the
site. It will lead to conflict with the neighbouring commercial
believe the close proximity of the Units to the lane with no buffer area will
be a threat to the Residents safety.
This can only result in great detriment to all who currently use of the
laneway its use which we all now enjoy.
For all the reasons stated we consider this a highly inappropriate
Development".
Mr Milner also undertook complete documentation and discussed the design
response against elements of the Good Design Guide concluding:
"This report has detailed an analysis of the proposal to establish five
double storey dwellings to be located on land at 127 St Andrews
This report was found:
* that the site is excellently located for medium density housing;
* that the proposal is entirely consistent with policy;
* that the proposal is consistent with the purposes of the zone;
* that the proposal has responded to the characteristics, opportunities and
constraints presented by the site and the neighbourhood
Following the Hearing, the Tribunal visited the site to understand the concerns
of the Objectors fully.
REASONS FOR ORDER
M/s West outlined the proposal and locality/site as:
"The application for a planning permit proposes to develop five double
storey, attached dwellings and use the site for the purpose
of multi-units.
The proposal can be summarised as follows:
* Unit 1will have a living room, dining room, kitchen, laundry and bathroom
on the ground floor. The first floor contains two bedrooms,
a study and
* Units 2, 3 and 4 comprise a kitchen, living room and laundry on the
ground floor. The first floors contain two bedrooms, a study
* Unit 5 comprises a living room, kitchen, meals area, bedroom, bathroom
and laundry on the ground floor. The first floor consists
of a bedroom and
* Unit 1 has a ground floor area of 76 square metres and a first floor area
of 79 square metres.
* Unit 2 has a ground floor area of 56 square metres and a first floor area
of 82 square metres.
* Unit 3 and 4 have a ground floor areas of 57 square metres and first
floor areas of 78 square metres.
* Unit 5 has a ground floor area of 86 square metres and a first floor area
of 37 square metres.
* The development proposes a ground floor setback to St Andrews Street of
3.0 metres, a setback of between 1.0 and 6.6 metres from
the northern boundary,
a setback from the southern boundary of between 2.0 and 3.0 metres and a
setback to the western boundary of
between zero and 6.6 metres.
* The development proposes a first floor setback from St Andrews Street of
4.0 metres, a setback to the north of 4.5 and 7.5 metres,
a setback to the
western boundary of 6.0 metres and a setback of between 2.5 and 3.7 metres to
* Dwelling 1 proposes an area of open space measuring 58 square metres
located within the front setback of the dwelling.
* Dwelling 2 proposes an area of open space measuring 25 square metres
located to the north of the site.
* Dwelling 3 proposes an area of open space measuring 26 square metres
located to the north of the site.
* Dwelling 4 proposes an area of open space measuring 28 square metres,
located to the north of the site.
* Dwelling 2, 3, and 4 propose north facing balconies with an area of 9
square metres on the first floor of each dwelling.
* Dwelling 5 proposes an area of open space measuring 48 square metres
located to the north and south of the site.
* Units 2, 3 and 4 are provided with tandem garages, each capable of
accommodating two vehicles with access provided, fronting the
laneway, which
runs along the north of the site.
* Pedestrian access to each of the dwellings is proposed via a path located
along the southern side of the site.
* The development is contemporary in design and proposes a rendered finish
with pitched roof elements.
* The development proposes a front fence to be constructed using brick and
concrete columns with wrought iron in-fill.
* The development proposes a density of one dwelling per 177 square metres
and has a site coverage of 54.7%.
* The subject site is located on the western side of St Andrews Street,
approximately 25 metres south of the Bay Street and St Andrews
intersection.
* The subject site has a frontage to St Andrew Street of 20.45 metres and a
depth of 49.68 metres, giving the site a total area of
1015.96 square metres.
There is an existing carriageway easement, which runs along the northern
boundary of the site and forms the
laneway. The carriageway reduces the area
available for development to approximately 931.98 square metres.
* The site is bounded on the north by the carriageway, which runs along the
rear of shops having a frontage to Bay Street. The Bay
Street shopping
precinct is a strip shopping centre providing a range of commercial facilities.
The Sandringham Railway line and
a number of buses run through the centre
providing public transport.
* St Andrews Street is a street which is primarily comprised of single
storey detached dwellings on relatively large residential
lots. St Andrews
Street intersects Bay Street and continues to the northern side of Bay Street
as Asling Street. The character
of St Andrews Street changes adjacent to the
Bay Street intersection, taking on a more commercial appearance with the
presence of
a hotel and loading facilities on the eastern side of the street
and the side elevations of the larger scale commercial buildings
forming the
streetscape.
* On street parking in St Andrews Street is limited to 2 hour parking
between 8am to 6pm Monday to Sunday.
* The site is presently occupied by a single storey dwelling. Vehicle
access to the site is provided via the laneway, which runs
along the northern
boundary of the site. The site has a slope from the north-eastern corner to
the south western corner with a difference
of 1.69 metres between the two
points. The site is presently fairly heavily vegetated in the front and rear
setback with a variety
of different plant species. This vegetation provides a
thick screening between the existing dwelling and the street.
* A single storey weatherboard dwelling is located to the south of the
site. There are two garage structures located on the northern
boundary of the
site. The dwelling to the west is a single storey brick dwelling existing as
part of a unit development. The properties
to the north of the laneway are
commercially zoned. These buildings are single and double storey. The vehicle
facilities dominate
the southern elevations.
* The site is located within a precinct of mixed architectural styles and
forms the interface between the commercial and residential
zones. Although the
surrounding buildings vary in materials and façade treatment, their
scale and massing is consistent.
* The site is included in Area 2 of Council's Urban Character and
Streetscape Study. This study has local policy status and has
been adopted by
Council after a significant consultation process. The Study has described the
area as having a good residential
quality `due mainly to a leafy and green
environment', and describes the street shopping centres as having a `major
community focus'.
One of the objectives of the Study is to `encourage
consolidated residential development to Activity Areas with increased densities
where appropriate around Martin Street and Bay Street'".
This appeal is about amenity and to a lesser extent neighbourhood character in
the location of the site on the interface with the
commercial area of Bay
The inspection was very helpful in understanding the concerns of the Objectors,
however the inspection revealed that there are not
likely to be any loss of
amenity issues from this proposal to adjoining properties. The underlying
concern of the two Objectors
at the Hearing was traffic and parking. The
Tribunal is very familiar with traffic events and does not see the proposed
a concern at all. The laneway is an access road and not a parking
area or loading zone. The site has access and right to use just
as the shops
that front Bay Street and all must co-exist.
In this proposal, the Responsible Authority has carefully considered the
various aspects in relation to all relevant elements of
the Good Design guide
and the Tribunal is satisfied that it is a development that will add to the
area rather than detract and will
not create a loss of amenity for abutting
properties. The request will be disallowed.
For the reasons outlined, the request is disallowed and the Responsible
Authority is directed to issue a planning permit for the
five (5) attached
dwellings with conditions 1 - 11 as listed in the Notice of Decision to Grant a
Permit dated 25
