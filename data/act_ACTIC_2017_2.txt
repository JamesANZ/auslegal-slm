charges as laid do not address the capacity in which the defendant is alleged to
owe a duty nor the duty or duties alleged to
Informations and Summons were sworn before the Deputy Registrar on 2 December
2017. An Affidavit of Service of the Informations
and Summons was lodged with
the court, together with the Particulars, on 7 February 2017, which is outside
of the two year limitation
period provided by
Work Health and
Safety Act 2011
Particulars delineate the manner in which it is alleged DECC contravened its
duty, and claim that an individual, to whom the
duty was owed, sustained injury
because of DECC’s alleged contravention.
the 10 March 2017, being the second mention date, the prosecution amend the
charge and the defendant agreed to the proposed amendment.
The amendment relates to charge CC16/41492 only and the proposed amendeded
charge reads as follows:
On 4 December 2014 at Canberra House, 45 West Row and 40 Marcus Clarke
Street, Canberra City in the Australian Capital Territory,
being a site or
workplace, Demolition Environmental Civil Contractors Pty Ltd, being a person
conducting a business or undertaking,
contravened

and Safety Act 2011
in that: they had a health and safety duty (category 2) by
sections 19(1)
, (3)(a) and (c); they failed to comply with that duty;
and that failure exposed an individual, namely David Keena, to risk of death,
serious injury or illness.
proposed amendment, if allowed, addresses the defect in the
the preliminary issue now before the court is whether the charge can be
corrected by an amendment filed after the expiry
of the limitation
this issue, the prosecution, by way of written submissions, seeks leave from the
court to amend the charges after the expiry of
the limitation period under
Magistrates Court Act 1930
Power of the court to amend information
(1) If at the hearing of any information or summons any objection is
taken to an alleged defect in it in substance or form or if objection
to any variance between the information or summons and the evidence adduced at
the hearing of it, the court may make any
amendment in the information or
summons that appears to it to be desirable or to be necessary to enable the real
question in dispute
to be decided.
(2) The court must not make an amendment under subsection (1) if it considers
that the amendment cannot be made without injustice
to the defendant.
prosecution submits that it is within the power of the court to grant leave for
the charge to be amended in circumstances where
the court found the charge
defective, or lacking particularity, and because no new offence is being created
by the amendment sought,
this would not create injustice to the
prosecution relies on the following authorities in making its submissions
[2011] VSCA 257
, [35], [37] and [44] and
Willing v Hollobone (No
(1975) SASR 118 at 121.
The prosecution submits that the amendment to the defective charge reflects the
Particulars served on the defendant together with
the Informations and Summons
(served 6 Feb 2017), and therefore the defendant has known the nature and terms
of the charge since
that time. It cannot, therefore, be said that an injustice
would be done to the defendant by granting leave to amend the charge as
In its submissions, the defendant objects to the amended charge because it
introduces “breaches of duties owed under
sections 19(3)(a)
and (c) of the
Work Health and Safety Act 2011
(ACT)” as “Additional
defendant submits that, where in the “opening chapeau”, the original
particulars refer to a breach of
section 19(1)
only, the amended charge now
alleges a total of three duties were breached. Therefore, the prosecution
“seeks to introduce
two new and different charges after the expiration of
the relevant limitation period”.
The defendant submits that “The proposed amended charge represents an
improper avoidance of the limitation period in relation
to the Additional Duties
which causes a significant injustice to DECC”. Accordingly, pursuant to
Magistrates Court Act 1930
(ACT), the Court must not grant
leave to the prosecution to amend the charge.
reply to the defendant’s claim that it is introducing two additional
charges, the prosecution submits that
sections 19(3)(a)
and (c) are pleaded in
paragraphs 1.1(g) and (c) of the Particulars served on the defendant on 6
February 2017.
is, therefore, the prosecution’s ultimate submission that it has
“not introduced two new and different duties not previously
known to the
defendant thereby improperly avoiding the limitation period; causing injustice
to the defendant”.
Determination
charges, brought two days prior to the expiry of the limitation period, are
defective in that they fail to identify the duty alleged
to have been breached
