The proceedings below
brief substance, in 2015, the Director instituted proceedings in the Federal
seeking declarations that the five CFMEU officials had contravened s 500 of the
Act, as permit holders within the meaning of that
section, by acting improperly
while exercising, or seeking to exercise, rights in accordance with Pt 3-4 of
that, by reason of s 793, the CFMEU was taken also to have contravened s 500.
its defence in each of the proceedings, the CFMEU admitted that each of the five
CFMEU officials had, by their actions, contravened
s 500 of the Act, and that,
by reason of s 793, the CFMEU was taken also to have contravened s 500
("the s 793 admissions").
s 793 admissions were based on an interpretation of that section which, until
recently, was generally assumed to be correct.
Other cases in which that
assumption was made include
Darlaston v

Director of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate v

a result of the CFMEU's admissions, the parties agreed upon statements of
including the s 793 admissions, which were filed in the proceedings before
Collier J for the determination of penalties. On 25
November 2015, Collier J
heard submissions on the basis of those agreed facts. Following the conclusion
of oral argument, and pursuant
to orders made on 10 December 2015, the parties
filed further written submissions on 29 February 2016 and 25 March
16 May 2016, while judgment stood reserved, Charlesworth J delivered judgment in
an unrelated matter,

, in which her Honour held that s 793 does not, of itself, fix
upon a body corporate liability for contraventions found to have been
learning of Charlesworth J's decision, on 31 May 2016 the CFMEU sought to file
in the Adelaide Registry of the Federal Court an
interlocutory application for
leave to withdraw the s 793 admissions. On 2 June 2016, Collier J
ordered that the interlocutory application
not be filed without leave of the
Court and made directions for the filing of submissions as to whether leave
should be granted.
19 July 2016, Collier J
that leave to file the interlocutory application be refused. In her reasons for
judgment, her Honour stated that the principles
to be applied where a court is
asked to hear further submissions after judgment has been reserved are as stated
by this Court in
Autodesk Inc v Dyason [No
Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions
and, more recently, by Gilmour J in
Featherby v Commissioner of
Accordingly, leave to advance further submissions once judgment has been
reserved should not be granted except in "very exceptional
circumstances"
Her Honour was further satisfied that such very exceptional circumstances did
not exist in this case because the CFMEU had made
the s 793 admissions on the
basis of legal advice and, although the CFMEU might now consider that
Charlesworth J's observations in
provided a basis for a new
argument to the
"no reason has been advanced by the CFMEU why it did not
rely upon such principles in its dealings with the Director or before this
Court, other than the apparent remissness of its lawyers in considering the
CFMEU's position".
that it had become apparent that the CFMEU sought by its application not only to
withdraw the s 793 admissions, but also to:
"'go back to
square one' so far as concerns the Director's case against it in respect of
s 500, and both amend its pleadings and require
a separate trial in respect
of its own position under s 500 of [the Act]".
being so, her Honour stated in effect that the observations of this Court
regarding the significance of case management principles
Aon Risk Services
Australia Ltd v Australian National
Expense Reduction Analysts Group Pty Ltd v Armstrong Strategic Management
and Marketing Pty

Federal Court of Australia Act
(Cth) as to the timely and efficient disposition of court business; and the
impact on the Court's resources if leave were granted
and the Court were
required to reopen the proceedings, all militated against the grant of leave.
J also expressly rejected submissions made on behalf of the CFMEU that to refuse
the CFMEU leave to file its interlocutory
application would be productive of
substantial injustice because it would bind the CFMEU to the s 793
admissions contrary to the
true operation of the provision, and therefore
contrary to law. Her Honour stated that, although she did not consider it
appropriate
to undertake a detailed examination of s 793 at such a late stage of
the proceedings, it was nonetheless relevant to note the following

application to show cause
its application for an order to show cause, the CFMEU seeks, in substance:
(a) a writ of prohibition to prohibit the Director from relying
upon the final judgment and orders of Collier J of 19 July 2016;
(b) a writ of mandamus to compel Collier J to hear and determine according
to law the CFMEU's application for leave to withdraw the
admissions.
grounds upon which that relief is sought are, in substance, that:
(1) Collier J's interlocutory decision to refuse the CFMEU leave
to file its application for leave to withdraw the s 793 admissions

to file such an application
and by reason of her Honour's failure authoritatively to determine the CFMEU's
objection to jurisdiction.
(2) Collier J's interlocutory decision is vitiated by jurisdictional error
constituted of Collier J's failure to undertake a detailed
examination of the
operation of s 793 and thereby her Honour's failure to consider the
mandatory requirement of the "interests of
justice" in the exercise of
discretion to refuse leave to file.
(3) Collier J's penalty decision is vitiated by jurisdictional error
constituted of Collier J proceeding on the basis that, as a
result of the
s 793 admissions, the Court had jurisdiction.
(4) Collier J's penalty decision is vitiated by jurisdictional error
constituted of Collier J's holding that, by reason of s 793,
the CFMEU was
to be taken to have contravened s 500.
(5) Collier J denied the CFMEU procedural fairness by failing to entertain

The parties'
contentions
Director contends that the application for an order to show cause should be
dismissed in the exercise of discretion under r 25.03.3(a)
because the
application inappropriately invokes the original jurisdiction of this Court in
circumstances where it was open to the
CFMEU to appeal to the Full Court of the
Federal Court, and, further or alternatively, because the CFMEU has not
identified any arguable
found relief by way of constitutional writ.
CFMEU answers that the Director's application should be rejected and that the
application for an order to show cause should be
referred for further hearing by
a Full Court of this Court pursuant to r 25.03.3(b). It submits that its
failure to take an appeal
to the Full Court of the Federal Court is not a basis
for discretionary dismissal of the present application because, when the matter
was before Collier J, the Director contended that a decision to refuse the CFMEU
leave to file its application for leave to withdraw
the s 793 admissions
was an administrative decision not subject to appeal. In any event, in the
CFMEU's submission, this Court's
constitutional writ jurisdiction exists
independently of any rights of appeal against an impugned decision.
CFMEU further contends that the suggestion that it has not identified any
It submits that the
imposition of a penalty on the CFMEU for a contravention of s 500 of the Act,
where that contravention is unknown
to the law and the CFMEU was incapable
therefore of committing it, in circumstances where the CFMEU sought to withdraw
admissions, constituted jurisdictional error. Further or
alternatively, in the CFMEU's submission, Collier J's failure to reach
concluded view as to the operation of s 793 was a failure to exercise
error. Finally, in
the further alternative, the CFMEU argues that, whether or not Collier J fell
into jurisdictional error, the
identified errors are errors of law on the face
of the record for which certiorari will go.

leave to appeal against Collier
J's refusal of leave to file the application for leave to withdraw the
s 793 admissions before final
judgment was delivered in each proceeding.
But that did not foreclose the CFMEU's ability to appeal against the final
judgment on
the basis that the CFMEU had been found to have committed a
contravention of s 500 which is unknown to law. Under
Federal Court of Australia Act

There was nothing to prevent the CFMEU appealing against the declaration that it
contravened s 500 of the Act, and against the penalty
imposed, on the basis
that, upon what is said to be the proper construction of s 793, the CFMEU could
not have contravened s 500.
Nor, in the event of such an appeal, would there
have been anything to prevent the Full Court considering whether, in light of
CFMEU's argument as to the proper construction of s 793, Collier J's refusal
to grant leave to the CFMEU to file its application
for leave to withdraw the
admissions was productive of substantial injustice.
fact that the Director wrongly contended before Collier J that an interlocutory
decision to refuse the CFMEU leave to file its
application for leave to withdraw
the s 793 admissions was an administrative decision not subject to appeal
is, to say the least,
unfortunate. But, for present purposes, it is
insignificant. The CFMEU submitted before Collier J that "the question of
file [the application for leave to withdraw the admissions] involves an
exercise of judicial rather than administrative
is nowhere deposed that the CFMEU was thereafter persuaded by the Director's
contrary submission to adopt a different view of
the matter. Nor is it
suggested that the CFMEU was otherwise influenced by the Director not to
exercise its rights of appeal against
Collier J's final judgment or to conclude
that, on such an appeal, the Full Court might not take into account that Collier
found the contraventions of s 500 to be established on the basis of
admissions that the CFMEU had sought, and been refused, leave
to withdraw. Of
course, if the Director's submission as to the administrative nature of the
decision had led the CFMEU to conclude
that it was bound to come here rather
than timeously exercising its rights of appeal in the Federal Court, one might
suppose that
fact would warrant an appropriate extension of time in which to
appeal. But that would be a matter for the Full Court of the Federal

may go to compel a defendant to perform a public
this case, the CFMEU alleges in effect that Collier J failed to perform her
judicial duty to determine its application for leave
to withdraw the s 793
admissions because her Honour failed to reach a concluded view as to the true
effect of that provision.
my judgment, that contention is untenable. As has been explained, Collier J
decided the application for leave to file the application
for leave to withdraw
the s 793 admissions on the basis that it had not been established that
there were present the very exceptional
circumstances necessary to render it
appropriate to allow a party to advance further arguments once a matter has been
reserved for
judgment; that case management principles and court resource
considerations militated against the grant of leave (and, in effect,
the opening
up of the proceedings for wholesale re-litigation); and that her Honour was not
satisfied that a refusal of leave would
be productive of substantial injustice
because it was not apparent that the CFMEU had necessarily erred in making the
s 793 admissions.
Plainly, Collier J did not fail to consider and
determine the CFMEU's application for leave to file the application for leave to
withdraw the s 793 admissions. Nor did her Honour deny the CFMEU
procedural fairness. Beyond peradventure, her Honour decided the
matter on the
multiple bases stated in her reasons, as summarised above, after devoting
detailed express consideration to each of
the submissions advanced by the CFMEU
in support of its application.
even if it be assumed for the sake of argument that Collier J was in error in
concluding that the circumstances were not
sufficiently exceptional to justify
the grant of leave to file the application for leave to withdraw the s 793
admissions, it does
not follow that her Honour would thereby have fallen into
the exercise of her jurisdiction to determine whether or not leave should be
granted. That would not be a jurisdictional
error, but an error in the exercise
of jurisdiction for which mandamus will not
for the CFMEU submitted that it was at least
that Collier J could not rationally determine the application for leave to file
the application for leave to withdraw the s 793 admissions
without first
determining whether the basis on which the CFMEU sought to withdraw the
admissions was sound, and thus without first
coming to a concluded view as to
whether s 793 has the meaning for which the CFMEU now contends. To do less, it
was submitted, would
result in a failure to determine the matters in issue
between the parties and, as such, would constitute a constructive failure to
exercise jurisdiction. In counsel's submission, that raises a question as to
the dimensions of the functions and powers of a Ch
III court which only this
Court can determine in the exercise of its constitutional writ jurisdiction.
Asked how that could be so
if the function being exercised by Collier J
resulted in an administrative decision as opposed to a judicial determination
(as counsel
had contended was also arguable), counsel replied that, because the
administrative decision prevented the CFMEU from withdrawing
its admissions, it
resulted in the CFMEU being found to have committed the relevant contraventions,
and thus resulted in Collier
J committing what was arguably a jurisdictional
error in determining liability according to an administrative decision rather
according to law. In counsel's submission, that squarely raises issues of
the kind considered by this Court in
Kirk v Industrial Court
concerning the functions and powers of a Ch III court.
reject the argument. As Collier J identified correctly, the question of whether
the CFMEU should be granted leave to file its
application for leave to withdraw
the s 793 admissions after judgment was reserved depended on whether the
circumstances were sufficiently
exceptional to allow the CFMEU to advance a new
argument as to the operation of s 793. Plainly enough, that involved making an
of the likelihood of success of the new argument, just as the
determination of any application to amend pleadings or advance a further
submission involves a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the proposed
amendment or submission. But, axiomatically, such an
assessment can never be
more than a preliminary and tentative assessment falling short of a final
determination of the issue. The
purpose of the assessment is to aid in the
determination of whether or not to grant the application, and a final
determination of
the issue cannot be undertaken until and unless the application
is granted. To suggest otherwise confounds the plain and necessary
distinction
between the discretionary determination of an interlocutory application for
leave to advance further submissions, to
amend a pleading or to withdraw an
admission − all of which are established matters of interlocutory
practice and procedure
− and the final determination of a matter after
such an interlocutory application has been determined. That distinction has
nothing to do with issues of the kind dealt with in
elements of a contravention of a provision of an Act or as to whether
legislative or executive constraints on the matters
which a Ch III court may
take into account in the determination of an issue are inconsistent with the
functions of that court as
provided in Ch III of the
Constitution
on this aspect of the matter, the CFMEU argued that the categories of

reach a concluded view as to the true effect of
s 793, the CFMEU did not

Public interest
it was submitted on behalf of the CFMEU that there are a very large number of
cases awaiting determination in the Federal
Court in which the meaning of s 793
is in issue, and consequently that the meaning of the section is a matter of
such public importance
that this application for an order to show cause should
be referred to a Full Court of this Court to allow for an authoritative
determination

do not accept that argument either. As Collier J
the CFMEU seeks not only to withdraw the s 793 admissions, but also to "'go
case against it".
Consequently, were this Court to construe s 793 favourably to the CFMEU, it
would not necessarily be determinative
of whether Collier J's final judgment
should be set aside. That determination might involve other discretionary
considerations with
which the Full Court of the Federal Court is better placed
to deal. Furthermore, as counsel for the Director informed me without
objection, there are now a large number of matters likely to be listed for
hearing in the February 2017 sittings of the Full Court
of the Federal Court
which turn on the correct construction of s 793. In those circumstances,
it would be preferable that the proper
construction of the section be determined
by the Full Court in one of those matters, so that when and if it becomes
necessary for
this Court to consider the meaning of the section, we will have
the benefit of the Full Court's reasons.
CFMEU argued that, if I were to dismiss its application for an order to show
cause, I should nevertheless refrain from ordering
that the CFMEU pay the costs
of the Director. Counsel for the CFMEU submitted that, since the Director had
maintained before Collier
J that the determination of the application for leave
to file an application for leave to withdraw the s 793 admissions was an
administrative
decision not subject to appeal, the CFMEU's decision to make an
application to this Court for an order to show cause, rather than
to pursue its
rights of appeal to the Full Court, was not without reasonable cause. That
being so, counsel submitted, it would be
an appropriate exercise of discretion
not to order the CFMEU to pay the Director's costs.
also pointed to s 570 of the Act, which relevantly provides in substance that a
party to proceedings in a court in relation
to a matter arising under the Act
may not be ordered by the court to pay costs incurred by another party to the
proceedings unless
the court is satisfied that the party instituted the
proceedings vexatiously or without reasonable cause. Counsel conceded that
there might be some doubt as to whether s 570 applies directly to a proceeding

regarded as an expression of legislative intent
and thus as a relevant
consideration in the exercise of

application that the CFMEU's application for an order to show cause be
dismissed, the Director maintained that
Collier J's decision to refuse leave to
file was an administrative decision not subject to appeal to the Full Court. As
contention was not directed towards the CFMEU's right of appeal against Collier
J's final judgment or the Full Court's ability
to take the interlocutory
decision into account upon such an appeal. But I accept that, in the manner in
which it was put and maintained,
the Director's contention as to the
administrative nature of the decision might be thought to have put in issue the
CFMEU's ability
to rely on the interlocutory decision as a ground of appeal
against the final judgment. In those circumstances, it appears that
the CFMEU's
decision to pursue the present application for an order to show cause was not
altogether unreasonable.
the reasons earlier given, I consider that the CFMEU's complaint of
suggest, however, that
the CFMEU's application for certiorari for error of law on the face of the
record is unarguable. That being
so, I consider that the most appropriate order
to make in the exercise of discretion is that there be no order as to costs.
the result, the application for an order to show cause is dismissed with no
order as to costs.
