NRA v Swan DP, Bloomfield DP, Fisher C [2009] QIC 19; 191 QGIG 87 (1 June 2009)
[Extract from Queensland Government Industrial
dated 12 June, 2009, Vol. 191, No. 5, pages 87-89]
INDUSTRIAL COURT OF QUEENSLAND
Relations Act 1999
- s. 248 - application for prerogative relief
National Retail Association Limited, Union of Employers AND
Deputy President Swan, Deputy President Bloomfield and Commissioner Fisher
(C/2009/10)
PRESIDENT HALL
1 June 2009
It is useful to commence by rehearsing the statutory background.
By s. 21 of the
Trading (Allowable Hours) Act 1990
the Industrial
Commission may decide trading hours for non-exempt shops. By s. 36 of the
Acts Interpretation Act 1954
the reference to the Industrial Commission
is a reference to the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission (the QRIC)
in existence by s. 255 of the
Industrial Relations Act 1999
(the Act). Section 265(1)(e) of the Act, one should add, expressly contemplates
that by another Act matters may be committed to
the QIRC for hearing and
determination.
By s. 256 of the Act, the QIRC may be constituted by a
Commissioner (as defined by s. 256(1)(b)) sitting alone or as a Full Bench
(defined by s. 256(2)). By s. 21(1) of the
Trading Allowable Hours Act
, when deciding trading hours for non-exempt shops, the QIRC must be
constituted as a Full Bench.
By s. 264(2) of the Act, in ordinary
circumstances, the function of determining the members of a Full Bench will be
discharged by
the Vice President. As s. 264(1) makes plain, the performance of
such a function is necessary for the orderly and expeditious exercise
QIRC's jurisdiction and powers.
As to the factual matters, the tale
commences with a decision of this Court in each of three proceedings instituted
in the Court by
the National Retail Association Limited Union of Employers
(hereafter the NRA). The NRA was successful in all proceedings (see
[2009] QIC 4
The Orders made by the Court (on 23 January 2009) were as
"The Order of the Industrial Court in Appeal Matter Nos.
C/2008/40 and C/2008/43 is:
(a) that the Decision of the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission be
set aside and that the matter be remitted to the Commission
to be heard and
determined according to law; and
(b) that the Full Bench rehearing the matter be constituted and selected by
members other than Vice President Linnane and Commissioners
The Order of the Industrial Court in Appeal Matter No.
C/2008/44 is:
(a) that the proceedings before the Queensland Industrial Relations
Commission be quashed and that the Commission hear afresh Application
(b) that the Full Bench hearing the matter afresh be constituted and
selected by members other than Vice President Linnane and Commissioners
and Thompson.".
As and from 23 January 2009, the effect of
disqualification from further participation in proceedings pursuant to the
Orders (above)
was that only Deputy President Swan, Deputy President Bloomfield
and Commissioner Fisher might lawfully have been invited to sit
on a Full Bench
established to hear the matters remitted by the Orders (above). [There have
been no discussions pursuant to either
s. 307(1) or s. 308(1) of the Act
It may be doubted that an application about trading hours for non-exempt
shops is an "industrial matter" for the purposes of s. 308(1).]
Orders made on 23 January 2009, contemplated the delegation of the entirely
ministerial function of issuing an invitation to Deputy
President Swan, Deputy
President Bloomfield and Commissioner Fisher to constitute the Full Bench in
each of the matters remitted
to the Commission. That the function at s. 261(2)
may be delegated to a Deputy President pursuant to s. 261(3) is made plain by
261(5) which provides:
"(5) A commissioner must comply with
a direction
of the vice
president or a
deputy president given for the performance of responsibilities
under subsection
.". [Emphasis added.]
delegation might a Deputy President acquire the power to issue a s. 261(2)
"direction". What in fact happened after publication
of the Orders of 23
January 2009, appears sufficiently from the affidavit of Mr Gary Black, the
Executive Director of the NRA sworn
on 12 March 2009. [To understand the
extract below one needs to know that the orders referred to, are the Orders of
23 January 2009
and that the cases numbered TH/2007/7, TH/2008/3 and TH/2008/4
are the matters remitted.] The material paragraphs are in the following
"(b) On 29 January 2009, the NRA sent a facsimile to the Queensland
Industrial Registry requesting that the above order be actioned
practicable.
(c) By 23 February 2009, the NRA had received no contact from the Registry
in relation to the orders flowing from this Court's decision
of 23 January 2009
or our correspondence of 29 January 2009.
(d) On 23 February 2009, the NRA telephoned the Registry to enquire into the
status of these matters and was advised that no action
has been taken and that a
further request should be lodged.
(e) On 24 February 2009, the NRA sent a further facsimile to the Registry
requesting a Full Bench to be constituted and matters TH/2007/7,
TH/2008/3 and
TH/2008/4 be listed for directions hearings as soon as practicable.
(f) As of 2 March 2009, the NRA has still not received any contact from the
Registry in relation to these matters.
(g) TH/2007/7 was originally filed on 7 December, with a hearing in Mackay
on 20 and 21 May and in Brisbane on 3 June 2008. The
Full Bench of the
Commission released their decision on 18 September 2008.
(h) TH/2008/3
and TH/2008/4 were both filed on 3 July 2008.".
The affidavit, which is
corroborated by an affidavit sworn by Mr Jed Isaac Moore on 31 March 2009, was
not the subject of cross-examination.
[Each of Deputy President Swan, Deputy
President Bloomfield and Commissioner Fisher entered an appearance, indicated an
to abide the Decision of the Court but otherwise (by consent) withdrew
from proceedings. The Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers
Association
(Industrial Organization of Employers) (the QRTSA) was granted leave to be
No explanation for the delay appears from the materials before
the Court. It is unnecessary to speculate whether a refusal to act
inferred. By s. 24 of the
Trading (Allowable Hours) Act 1990
Commission is required to deal with a s. 21 application "as quickly ... as is
consistent with a fair and proper hearing of the
issues". In circumstances in
which the Commission lacks corporate personality (if s. 24 is to have meaning)
each member of the Commission
who might sit as a member of a s. 21 Full Bench
must be treated as burdened by that statutory duty. Each of the Respondents has
been served and is aware of the factual situation.
Howsoever the
efficacy and order by performance of the QIRC's responsibilities may be
disrupted by errors and omissions in the discharge
of the function at s. 264(2),
the consequences are internal to the Commission and impact not at all on
litigants which have no or
limited means of knowing how (if at all) the function
has been performed. The general proposition is that developed by the Privy
Montreal Street Railway Co v Normandin
[1917] UKPC 2
[1917] AC 170
"When the provisions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty
and the case is such that to hold null and void acts
done in neglect of this
duty would work serious general inconvenience, or injustice to persons who have
no control over those entrusted
with the duty, and at the same time would not
promote the main object of the Legislature, it has been the practice to hold
such provisions
to be directory only.".
Here, the general proposition is
reinforced by s. 348(2) of the Act which operates to protect a decision of the
QIRC (once given)
from collateral attack.
Had Deputy President Swan,
Deputy President Bloomfield and Commissioner Fisher elected to sit as a Full
Bench to hear the matters
remitted by the Court, it may be doubted whether any
order under the
Trading (Allowable Hours) Act 1990
might have been
successfully challenged on the ground that an invitation to constitute a Full
Bench had not been issued. However,
that is not the issue before the Court.
The Court is being asked to make orders requiring Deputy President Swan, Deputy
Bloomfield and Commissioner Fisher to sit as a Full Bench,
notwithstanding that an invitation under s. 264(2) of the Act has not
issued. Granted that the remedies made available by s. 248(1)(e) of the Act are
discretionary in nature and that the Commission
is a court of record (see s.
255), the relief sought seems to me to be a step too far. I dismiss the
application.
