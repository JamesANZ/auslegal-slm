MELBOURNE, 20 DECEMBER 2024
Alteration of other rules of organisation.
On 11 December 2024 the Transport Workers' Union of Australia (TWU)
lodged with the Fair Work Commission (the Commission) a notice
and declaration
setting out particulars of alterations to its rules, to which R2024/179 refers.
On the same day, the TWU lodged with the Commission another notice
and declaration setting out particulars of alterations to its rules,
R2024/182 refers.
Further information in support of the alterations was provided on 17
December 2024.
The TWU seeks certification of the alterations under section 159 of
Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009
The particulars in R2024/179 set out alterations to Rule 8.
The particulars in R2024/182 set out alterations to Rules 6, 7, 10,
25, 72, 73, 92 and Rules 1, 3 and 23 of Annexure F. The particulars
delete Rules 93 and 94 and Rule 2 of Annexure F.
Rule altering procedure
Subrule 33(2)(c) states that the National Secretary shall provide
notice of National Council meetings to all branches. The declarations
matters advise that the National President provided notice of the National
Council meeting.
Therefore, it appears that in making the alterations, the procedure
required by Subrule 33(2)(c) was not strictly complied with. In
accordance with
paragraph 159(1)(c) of the Act, I am required to be satisfied that the
alterations have been made under the rules
of the organisation.
As discussed in
Master Builders’ Construction and Housing
Association of the Australian Capital
necessary to consider whether a failure to strictly comply with the
rule-altering procedure invalidated the decision to alter
the rules. In this
matter, I need to consider whether the failure to have the National Secretary
give the notice invalidated the
resolutions to make the rule alterations.
To assess this question, it is necessary to consider the decision of
the High Court in
Project Blue
application by a Full Bench of this Commission in
Re: Australian Principals
Federation.
In the context of the rules of registered organisations these authorities
indicate that the issue is not whether an instance of non-compliance
occurred (and as an inevitable consequence the decision to alter the rules is
invalidated). Instead, the issue is whether an
act which does not comply
strictly with the rules has no effect. To determine this, regard must be given
to the language, purpose,
scope and object of the relevant provisions.
Applying this reasoning to the facts before me, the purpose of
Subrule 33(2)(c) is that all members receive proper notice of a meeting,
can make an informed decision when attending it. In the circumstances, all
members have received sufficient notice, and the
TWU confirms that no member has
complaints.
view, the fact that the notice was given by the National President does not
invalidate the decision to alter the rules on this
occasion. However, the TWU
should ensure in future that all the provisions associated with transacting rule
alterations are complied
On the information contained in the notices, declarations and
further information provided in support of the alterations, I am satisfied
alterations in both R2024/179 and R2024/182 have been made under the rules of
the organisation.
The Rule Alterations
The alteration to Rule 10, the insertion of Subrule 92(aa2), and the
deletion of Rules 93 and 94 are minor and uncontroversial. They
are made to,
shorten the time
when an unfinancial member becomes financial;
definition for “Gig worker”; and
remove redundant
transitional provisions.
They do not require comment beyond expressing my opinion about the
matters set out in subsection 159(1) of the
The alterations to Rules 6, 7, 8, 25, 72, 73, 92 (except the
insertion of Subrule 92(aa2)) and Rules 1 – 3 and 23 of Annexure

of 1 January 2025.
Currently, the TWU in,

The alterations to Rules 7 and 73 remove the Entrance Fee and the
Training Fund, and introduce a new fund called the TWU Campaign
Fund. The new
fund will form part of the Annual Fee and become payable from 1 January
The alterations to Rules 6, 25, 72, 92 (except the insertion of
Subrule 92(aa2)) and Rules 1 – 3 and 23 of Annexure F are consequential
changes following the removal of the Entrance Fee.
The alterations to Rule 8 increase TWU’s Annual Fee from
$752.75 to $838.23 and make it payable from 1 January 2025.
Setting the rate of fees payable by members, removing existing fees
or funds, or introducing new funds is generally a matter for a
organisation and/or its branches to
Nothing about
the magnitude of the fee change, the size of the fees or funds, or the addition
or removal of them engages section
142(1)(c) of the Act.
Therefore, I am satisfied that the alterations to Rules 6, 7, 8, 25,
72, 73, 92 (except the insertion of Subrule 92(aa2)) and Rules
23 of Annexure F are not contrary to the Act or the
Fair Work Act 2009
(Cth) (FW Act) or fail to comply with those pieces of legislation. Nor is there
any basis to conclude that the proposed alterations
are contrary to modern
awards, enterprise agreements or otherwise contrary to law.
On 17 December 2024, the Assistant National Secretary of the TWU,
Emily McMillian, gave consent under subsection 159(2) of the Act
for me to make
various amendments to the alterations for the purpose of correcting
typographical, clerical or formal errors. Accordingly,
the following corrections
have been made:
In proposed
Subrules 25(g) and 92(1)(i), removed the second comma after the words
“Annual Fees”;
In proposed
Subrules 72(2)(a) and Rule 3 and Subrule 23(4) of Annexure F, removed the
redundant “and”; and
In proposed
Subrule 1(1) of Annexure F, changed the words “nor shall he or she”
to “No applicant shall”.
In a previous
urged the TWU to lodge time-sensitive rule alterations early in the calendar
year. Despite my suggestion, the TWU lodged the
current matters on 11 December
2024, less than three weeks before their fixed operative date of 1 January 2025.
The Commission published its 24-25 Corporate Plan on 30 August
It is clear
from the Plan that the Commission finalises 50% of matters within 8 weeks from
the date of lodgement and 90% of matters
within 16 weeks from the date of
In this instance, I have exercised my discretion to expediate
processing these matters. However, it would be a misconception that
Commission would arbitrarily accommodate short notice or prioritise one matter
over another. The Commission aims to treat all
matters with equal consideration
and fairness. I emphasise my previous suggestion that the TWU should attend to
future time-sensitive
rule alterations earlier in the calendar year.
In my opinion, the alterations comply with and are not contrary to
the Act, the FW Act, modern awards and enterprise agreements, are
not otherwise
contrary to law and were made under the rules of the organisation. I certify
accordingly under subsection 159(1) of

MacKenzie v
Administrative and Clerical officers’ Association, Commonwealth Public
, Spicer CJ, Joske J, 26 March 1962) the Commonwealth
Industrial Court was dealing with a challenge to a rule, among others which
provided that "all subscriptions to the association shall be determined from
year to year by conference or the executive council,
as the case may be".
Spicer CJ noted at 355: “There is nothing in the [
Conciliation and
Arbitration] Act [1904-1961 (Cth)]
or regulations which expressly limits the
power of the organization to fix its own subscriptions... There is, I think, no
to such a power being vested in bodies within the organization which
are representative of members”.
At 369, Joske J stated: “In my opinion this rule is not unreasonable...
Should this rule be administered in such a way as to
be oppressive, unreasonable
or unjust a remedy is available under s.143 of the Act”.
Nothing about the Act compels a different conclusion. I note for completeness
that s,143 of the
Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1961
concerned with cancellation of the registration of an organisation.
