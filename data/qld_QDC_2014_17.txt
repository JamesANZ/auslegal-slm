SOLICITORS:
Butler McDermott Lawyers for the Applicant
Introduction
[1] The plaintiff seeks leave to lodge a further caveat in
respect of land owned by the defendant and situated at 10 Osmanthus Close,
Brightwater, and more particularly described as Lot 424 on SP213874, County of
Canning, Parish of Mooloola, bearing title reference
50765068 (“the
Brightwater property”). The additional complication is that for reasons
outlined subsequently the application
has been brought on an ex parte basis and
accordingly the applicant also requires leave to dispense with the requirements
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999
in respect of the service of
this application on the respondent.
[2] The application filed in this
regard on 24 January 2014, alternatively sought any other appropriate order and
also that costs
be reserved. Accordingly the reasons that follow are in respect
of the following orders made on 6 January 2014:
application for this order is made returnable immediately.
Plaintiff must serve the Claim, the Statement of Claim, the Amended Statement of
Claim, the Application filed 24 January 2014,
the Affidavit of the Plaintiff
filed 24 January 2014 and this order:
(a) Upon each
of the Defendant and David John Latemore by no later than Wednesday, 12 February
(b) Upon any
other person whom the Plaintiff knows or in future learns claims an interest in
the property described as Lot 424 on
SP 213874, County of Canning, Parish of
Mooloolah, bearing title reference
referred to as 10 Osmanthus Close, Brightwater in the State of Queensland
(“the Property”) as soon as is reasonably
practicable.
to the next paragraph, this order has effect up to and including 4pm on 21
February 2014 (“the Return Date”).
On the Return Date at 10:30am
there will be a further hearing in respect of this order and the Application
filed 24 January 2014
before a judge listed in Applications.
served with or notified of this order may apply to the Court at any time to vary
or discharge this order or so much of it as
affects the person served or
Defendant must not personally or in any other way dispose of, deal with,
diminish the value of or encumber the Property or allow
the Property to be
diminished, encumbered or charged in any way.
6. The costs of the
application are reserved.
These orders were made upon the applicant giving the following
undertakings:
Plaintiff undertakes to submit to such order (if any) as the Court may consider
just for the payment of compensation (to be assessed
by the Court or as it may
direct) to any person (whether or not a party) affected by the operation of the
Plaintiff will take all reasonable steps to comply with Order 2 above with
respect to service.
soon as practicable, the Plaintiff will cause anyone notified of this order to
be given a copy of it.
Plaintiff will pay the reasonable costs of anyone other than the Defendant
which have been incurred as a result of this order.
this order ceases to have effect, the Plaintiff will promptly take all
reasonable steps to inform in writing anyone who has been
notified of this
order, or who he has reasonable grounds for supposing may act upon this order,
that it has ceased to have effect.
[3] This application is made in the proceedings commenced by way
of claim filed on 17 December 2013. In that claim the following relief
“1. A declaration that
the defendant holds the property at 10 Osmanthus Close, Brightwater, more
particularly described as Lot
424 on SP213874, County of Canning, Parish of
Mooloola, bearing title reference 50765708 [sic] (“the Brightwater
on constructive trust for the plaintiff and the defendant, in
proportions to be determined by this honourable court.
this honourable court sees fit, orders for the taking of an account of the
monies utilised by the defendant to purchase the Brightwater
order charging the defendant’s interest in the Brightwater property in
favour of the plaintiff.
Consequential
orders for the transfer of such share in the Brightwater property by the
defendant to the plaintiff as this honourable
court sees fit.
the alternative to order 4 hereof, an order that the defendant pay to the
plaintiff such sum as represents the value of the plaintiff’s
interest in
the Brightwater property.
the further alternative, equitable compensation in an amount to be determined by
this honourable court.
pursuant to
Civil Proceedings Act
[4] First it can be noted that this court has jurisdiction in respect of the
claim which has been filed pursuant to
subsection 68(1)(b)(viii)
as far as it relates to a claim for a declaration that a trust subsists.
Further and on that basis, this court has, pursuant
Court of Queensland Act 1967
, the full powers and authorities of the Supreme
Court. Further and to the extent that the jurisdiction to entertain this
application
or power to make the order sought is not granted under
Land Title Act 1994
District Court of Queensland Act 1967
provides this court with the full powers and authorities of the Supreme Court
for the purposes of exercising its jurisdiction under
Application
[5] Leave to lodge a further caveat is required pursuant to
Land Title Act 1994
(“LTA”). This is because on 3
July 2013 the plaintiff, without the benefit of legal assistance, lodged a
caveat in respect
of the Brightwater property. In that caveat the interest
being claimed was described as “an equitable interest as purchaser
estate in fee simple” and the grounds of the claim were described
“a constructive trust has arisen from funds outstanding to the
caveator from Family Law Court order BRC8621/2011 and the caveator
is protecting
their financial interest. Further matters are on foot under appeal NA15/2013 in
the Full Appellate Court.”
However the plaintiff received a
requisition dated 11 July 2013 and which required response by 8 August 2013.
That indicated that
“examination of the ... document has revealed that it
does not meet Land Registry requirements for registration” and
leaving aside some issues only going to form, the requisition notice indicated
that lodgement fees were required to be paid
and that a copy of “court order BRC8621/2011 should be deposited in
support of the grounds of claim.” Those matters
were not attended to and
the caveat was rejected on 23 August 2013.
[6] Before dealing with the
reasons for that and the basis upon which leave for a further caveat is sought,
it is convenient to set
out some context. It can also be noted that although
misdescribed as to the basis upon which an equitable interest was claimed in
lodged caveat, it is accepted that the applicant is now seeking to protect
substantially the same interest and more importantly
for the application of
of the LTA, seeking to do so on substantially the same grounds.
plaintiff and Mr David Latemore, the son of the respondent, were married in
1998. On 4 January 2002 Mr David Latemore became
the registered proprietor
of a property at 2 Silveroak Court, Mountain Creek (“the Mountain Creek
property”). The marriage
failed and Mr David Latemore commenced
proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court on 12 September 2011. It is the
applicant’s
contention that the Mountain Creek property formed part of the
pool of matrimonial assets. A mortgage had been registered against
the Mountain
Creek property in favour of Perpetual Trustees Victoria Ltd. However, as at 30
April 2012, the balance owing on the
loan account which was secured by that
mortgage, was nil. On 2 May 2012 and 24 July 2012 Mr David Latemore
withdrew a total of $300,465.40
from the loan
The evidence of the plaintiff is
that this was not disclosed to her and remained undisclosed prior to the making
of property settlement
orders, by consent and after negotiation of the parties,
on 30 August 2012 (that is the order referred to as
BRC8621/2011).
[8] A particular focus is
upon the way in which the Mountain Creek property was incorporated in the
property settlement orders and
in particular the following clauses:
“18. On or before 1
October 2012, the husband will pay to the wife, or as she may direct, the sum of
two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars ($250,000).
the event that the husband fails to comply with his obligations in accordance
with paragraph 2 of this order, the husband will,
within a further fourteen (14)
days do all such acts and things and sign all such documents as are necessary to
transfer to the wife
a fifty percent (50%) interest in the property situated at
and known as 2 Silveroak Court, Mountain Creek, in the State of Queensland
“Mountain Creek property”) and upon such transfer, the wife will be
entitled to and will receive fifty percent (50%)
of the rental income for the
Mountain Creek property on a monthly basis at all times that the Mountain Creek
property is rented...
fourteen (14) days of the date of this order, the husband, and if necessary, the
wife, will do all such acts and things and
sign all such documents as are
necessary to pay out and discharge the current indebtedness to Perpetual
Trustees Victoria Ltd pursuant
to mortgage no 705304878 registered on the title
of the Mountain Creek property and shall not again encumber the property during
the life tenancy period PROVIDED THAT the husband be solely liable for meeting
any such indebtedness.”
[9] It appears that the reference in clause 19 to “paragraph 2 of this
order” is an erroneous reference to paragraph
18 of the orders that were
made. The sum of $250,000 referred to in paragraph 18 of the property
settlement orders was not paid
by 1 October 2012, or at all. The plaintiff
however did receive a 50% interest in the Mountain Creek property but that came
the encumbrance securing the loan of $300,465.40, which indebtedness and
encumbrance has not been resolved in accordance with paragraph
property settlement orders.
[10] It may be
accepted that an underlying rationale of the property settlement orders was to
provide the applicant with approximately
a 48% share of the matrimonial asset
, and that a 50% interest in the Mountain
Creek property was to be a substitute for and security in lieu of the payment of
of $250,000.00, and have beneficial effect of some equivalence. On the
face of it that is not what has occurred. A valuation performed
for Mr David
Latemore in the course of the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court,
valued the Mountain Creek property at $400,000.00
as at 12 December
Whilst the applicant now has a 50% legal
and beneficial interest in that property, it is otherwise encumbered to the
extent of at
least $300,465.40 and notwithstanding that it may be contended that
David Latemore remains solely responsible for the repayment of
indebtedness, he entered bankruptcy on 17 October 2012 and has acknowledged to
the applicant a lack of capacity to do so.
plaintiff deposes to the Mountain Creek property being sold at auction on or
is yet to receive any of the
[11] It is the plaintiff’s
understanding that the settlement in respect of the purchase of the Brightwater
property occurred
on or about 25 September 2012, consistently with the
Queensland Land Registry settlement notice executed on that date and which
that the transferee in respect of the property is the respondent and
that the respondent has granted a mortgage over the property
to AFSH Nominees
[12] The plaintiff says that it
was not until 17 October 2012 that she learned of the redraws under the mortgage
on the Mountain Creek
deposes that Mr David Latemore told her that he had moved into the
Brightwater property and it is the plaintiff’s
understanding, that when
her daughter is with her father, she stays at that
[13] On 4 January 2013 the
applicant filed an application for contravention of the orders made in the
Federal Magistrates Court and
on 21 January 2013, the applicant had subpoenae
issued to a bank seeking the bank account records of both Mr David Latemore
respondent from 1 June 2012. In the result and by correspondence dated
25 January 2013 each of Mr David Latemore and the respondent
raise objections to the subpoenae. In the respondent’s case he
“I object on the basis that the applicant has no grounds to request
such items or documents as the matter has nothing to do
with myself. Further,
the Federal Magistrate has yet to hear the matter to determine any possible
contravention.”
[14] By letter dated 4 February 2013, the parties in the Federal Magistrates
Court were advised that the objection to the subpoenae
would be heard when the
matter came before the Federal Magistrate on 25 February
However, that did not occur because
on that day the Federal Magistrate dealt with the application for contravention
of orders and
on 28 February 2013, orders were made that Mr David Latemore
be sentenced to:
“a period of imprisonment, commencing immediately and ending:
(a) when he has served a period of six (6) months; or
(b) he complies with order 26 of the orders made on 30 August 2012 in the
Federal Magistrates Court of Australia, Queensland
whichever happens
[15] However, on appeal to the Full Court of the Family Court of Australia and
on 29 April 2013, those orders were set aside and
the application for
contravention made by the applicant was
Primarily, that was because it
was uncontentious that on 17 October 2013 the husband entered into bankruptcy
and a trustee was appointed
to his estate and because of the effect of
Bankruptcy Act 1966
(Cth), which precluded a creditor
seeking to enforce any remedy against a bankrupt debtor or the property of the
bankrupt in respect
of a provable debt or, except with the leave of a court, to
commence any legal proceeding in respect of a provable debt or take any
step in such a proceeding. That was further because of a determination that the
contravention proceedings, although leading
to a sanction of imprisonment
specifically having regard to the position of the bankruptcy, were considered to
be proceedings in
respect of a provable debt, in the sense of the refusal to or
failure to comply with the order to discharge the mortgage on the Mountain
This was further considered to
follow because, by her contravention application, the applicant in fact sought
that the mortgage
debt be discharged pursuant to the orders and reference was
made to her affidavit in support of the contravention application, where
“33. It is my firm belief that during the month of September, the
respondent moved sums of money amounting to approximately
$500,000 through
various Suncorp accounts in his name, and finally either withdrawing them or
moving them to a Suncorp account in
his father’s name. This would be
proved by subpoenas on any and all Suncorp accounts held in the
respondent’s name and
in the name of Glenn Desmond Murray Latemore.
is my firm belief that these monies were used in part or full to go towards the
purchase of the property located at 10 Osmanthus
Close, Brightwater.”
[16] Although there is no clear account as to the dealings of Mr David Latemore,
with these funds, which emerges from the contravention
proceedings, he did tell
“The money was drawn down prior to their signing of the
orders, because it was known full well by myself and the applicant’s
lawyer and the applicant herself was notified that because – because I
needed somewhere obviously I can take our child to,
and in the end I end up with
nothing apart from paying board to my parents. There is no other – I
don’t have –
every asset I have has been seized by the
[17] The applicant has
also deposed to her understanding of the limited financial means of the
respondent, in order to have independently
purchased the Brightwater property
and to her past observations of a closeness of collaboration in or at least
knowledge of the respondent
as to the financial affairs of Mr David
She has provided evidence of the
respondent’s unsuccessful application to intervene in the proceedings in
the Federal Magistrates
Court, on the purported basis of seeking the repayment
of $650,250.00 from the total amount of $876,000.00 paid to Mr David Latemore
way of loan and in cash payments and taken from funds originally passed to the
respondent in cash, by his late father. This, at
the very least, seems to
demonstrate that the Respondent had some knowledge of and was interested as to
the proceedings in the Federal
Magistrates Court.
the principles to be applied to applications brought under
Land Title Act 1994
, the applicant relied particularly on the observations of
Chesterman J in Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd v Becker
[2003] QSC 301
, as follows:
Section 129
is new. The previous legislation forbad lodging further caveats on
the same or substantially the same grounds as caveats which had
lapsed or had
been removed. The section confers no guidance for the exercise of the court's
power to permit a fresh caveat to replace
a lapsed one. There is clearly a broad
general discretion to be exercised by reference to whatever considerations are
relevant in
the particular case.
[18] In accordance with general principle the applicant for leave must show
that the order is appropriate in all the circumstances.
Obviously the applicant
must demonstrate a caveatable interest in the land such as to justify the
caveat. If the grounds for lodging
the caveat are arguable rather than plain
questions of the balance of convenience between caveator and caveatee must be
as they are in applications to remove caveats.
[19] The reason why the caveat was allowed to lapse in the first place and
any delay and explanation for the delay will ordinarily
be relevant factors but,
depending on the circumstances, will not be decisive. Any prejudice that a
caveatee would suffer by reason
of the lodging of a second caveat would be
[20] In a case such as the present where the plaintiff's interest in the land
is clearly established and could be defeated in the
absence of a caveat I
apprehend that the application should be granted notwithstanding delay, and even
in the absence of some reasonable
explanation for allowing the caveat to lapse
in the first place, unless the grant of leave would be unfair, in the sense of
prejudice, to the caveatee. In such a case the competing interests of
the parties would have to be assessed.”
[19] To similar effect are the observations of Wilson J in Landlush Pty Ltd v
[2002] QSC 219
[2003] 1 Qd R 236
“The Court has discretion whether to grant
leave to lodge a second caveat on the same grounds as a lapsed caveat. The
on which the Court will order a current caveat to be removed are a
relevant consideration. It is well established that a current
caveat should be
removed unless the caveator shows that there is a serious question to be tried
which would justify leaving it undisturbed
McKean's Caveat
[1988] 1 Qd R 524)
and the balance of convenience favours the maintenance of the
status quo. A fortiori, where leave is sought to lodge a second caveat
same grounds as one that has lapsed, the applicant should at least satisfy those
criteria. The Court should consider also
whether there is a satisfactory
explanation for the lapse of the first caveat, whether there is a satisfactory
explanation for any
delay in making the application for leave, and whether the
respondent would be unduly prejudiced by the lodging of a second
[20] The difference in emphasis and outcome in these cases is largely reflective
of the different circumstances as to the extent
to which there was evidence of a
caveatable interest, or at least a serious question to be tried in respect of
the claimed interest
in the property and therefore, the extent to which the
considerations as to the balance of convenience and prejudice became
[21] More like the situation in Landlush and where the application
was unsuccessful, notwithstanding the finding of a serious question
to be tried
in respect of the claimed interest in relation to the beneficial title of the
property; the caveatable interest claimed
here depends upon the
applicant’s ability to obtain a remedy of declaration of a trust in the
subject property. However, and
unlike the position in the both cited decisions,
this application is made on an ex parte basis.
[22] On the initial hearing
of that application, on 31 January 2014, the applicant was granted leave to read
and file an amended statement
of claim. In that statement of claim and in
reference to the pleaded facts as to the existence and then breakdown of the
of the applicant and Mr David Latemore and the property settlement
proceedings in respect of that marriage, the basis upon which
the constructive
trust is alleged to have arisen in respect of the Brightwater property is
pleaded as follows:

the Plaintiff
David John Latemore
commenced the property settlement proceeding, David
John Latemore held the Mountain Creek property on constructive trust and for

marriage between the Plaintiff and David John Latemore and was
an asset of the

10A. Further, or in the alternative, on the making of the orders, David
John Latemore held the Mountain Creek property and all moneys
procured by
borrowing against that property on constructive trust to the Plaintiff and for
no later than 2 May 2012, the Defendant knew that:
(a) David John
Latemore was the registered proprietor of the Mountain Creek property;
(b) the marriage between the Plaintiff and David John Latemore had come to an
(c) the Plaintiff had applied for orders including for a property settlement
of the assets of her marriage with David John Latemore;
(d) the matrimonial asset pool of the Plaintiff and David John Latemore was
such that any fair and equitable distribution of the assets
of the marriage
would likely involve the plaintiff being granted an interest in the Mountain
Creek property, or alternatively being
paid a sum representing a substantial
proportion of the market value of the Mountain Creek property.
Particulars
(i) The Defendant had actual knowledge of each of the matters alleged.
(ii) Further, or alternatively, the Defendant had constructive knowledge by
reason of his relationship with David John Latemore and
that it was obvious to
the Defendant that David John Latemore was capable of raising the sum of
approximately $300,000 only by drawing
against the Mountain Creek
property, in which the Plaintiff had, or was likely to have, an interest as a
consequence of the breakdown of the marriage.

The Plaintiff is not presently able to particularise the date(s) or manner of
the said payment(s).
The money was paid at a time at which it was subject to a constructive
trust as pleaded at paragraph 10 or paragraph 10A hereof.
Further particulars will be provided, if possible, following the completion
of interlocutory steps.
the premises pleaded at paragraphs 2 to 7 and 10

“the Brightwater Property”
Defendant became the registered proprietor of the Brightwater Property on or
the premises pleaded in this statement of claim, the Defendant holds the
Brightwater Property on constructive trust for himself
and for the Plaintiff in
proportions to be determined by this Honourable
Particulars
The proportions in which the Defendant holds the Brightwater Property are to
be determined by reference to:
(a) the proportion which the Trust Property bore to the market value of the
Mountain Creek property as at the dates of David John
withdrawals from the loan account; and
(b) the proportion which the Trust Property bore to the purchase price of the
Brightwater Property.
or in the alternative, by reason of his knowing receipt of the Trust Property
procured in breach of the said trust, the Defendant
is liable to pay equitable
compensation to the Plaintiff in an amount to be determined by this Honourable
Particulars
The equitable compensation is to be calculated by reference to the value of
50% interest in the Mountain Creek property, as at 1 October
2012, on the basis
that the Mountain Creek property was free of encumbrance, in accordance with the
[23] The applicant relies particularly on the circumstances that:
(a) a starting point is that the applicant has been deprived of the benefit
which the property settlement orders contemplated;
(b) the reason the
applicant has been so deprived and placed in a poor financial situation, is that
Mr David Latemore had taken the
benefit of the funds redrawn from the loan
account but and apparently in contravention of the property settlement orders,
remains unpaid and secured against the Mountain Creek property and as
Mr David Latemore is now a bankrupt and whilst he remains so,
there is no
realistic prospect of repayment by or recovery from him personally;
(c) although it is conceded that it is not known whether (in a direct
sense) and when any such transfer occurred and that the timing
importance to which of the claimed bases of existence of a constructive trust
needs to be pursued by the applicant, an
inference arises from these
circumstances, including the timing of the known transactions, particularly in
the context of the property
settlement proceedings and orders and the residence
of Mr David Latemore in the Brightwater Property and the actions of he and
respondent in seeking to resist the subpoena and the lack of explanation
provided on the enforcement proceedings in the Federal Magistrates
what is deposed to as the respondent’s known financial circumstances and
capacity to have otherwise purchased this
property, that a transfer of at least
a substantial proportion of the loan redraws must have occurred.
[24] Further, and in the context of what the applicant has deposed as to the
past closeness of consultation and collaboration between
Mr David Latemore and
his father (the respondent) as to financial matters and the respondent’s
interest in the property settlement
proceedings, as evidenced by his application
to intervene, an inference also arises as to the knowledge of the respondent as
source of and circumstances under which any such transfer was made to him
to enable the purchase of the Brightwater Property.
[25] On this
application reference was made to the statement of general principle in
Baumgartner v Baumgartner
[1987] HCA 59
(1987) 164 CLR 137
at 147-148, as to the finding of a
constructive trust. There and after referring to an earlier statement in
Muschinski v Dodds
[1985] HCA 78
(1985) 160 CLR 583
at 618-620, it was observed:
Honour pointed out that the constructive trust serves as a remedy which equity
imposes regardless of actual or presumed
agreement or intention ‘to
preclude the retention or assertion of beneficial ownership of property to the
extent that such
retention or assertion would be contrary to equitable
principle’. In rejecting the notion that a constructive trust will be
imposed in accordance with idiosyncratic notions of what is just and fair his
Honour acknowledged that general notions of fairness
and justice are relevant to
the traditional concept of unconscionable conduct, this being a concept which
underlies fundamental equitable
concepts and doctrines, including the
constructive trust.”
[26] However and as may be noted from the pleading extracted above from the
amended statement of claim, the contention as to the
circumstances giving rise
to the constructive trust claimed as a remedy here, is not without complication.
Also it potentially remains
to be seen whether there is any suggestion of any
equitable interest of Mr David Latemore in the Brightwater
Further, and in specific
recognition of authorities to the effect that a claim for settlement of
property, or the possibility or
expectation of that occurring, under the
Law Act 1975
, does not amount to an interest in land and therefore a caveatable
the applicant recognises that
there is a need to otherwise establish an equity in the nature of a constructive
trust in property
which has been transferred in breach of that trust and become
part of the funds used to purchase the Brightwater Property. There
is therefore
an element of tracing towards the establishment of an equity in the nature of a
constructive trust and therefore a caveatable
interest in the Brightwater
Property. However the applicant rightly concedes that her case will necessarily
be stronger in that
regard if, as presently appears to be more likely, any
transfer of funds for that purpose occurred after the making of the property
settlement orders.
[27] The applicant sought to explain that her earlier
attempt at lodgement of a caveat should be viewed in the context of her then
absence of legal representation and her ongoing predicament in respect of the
property settlement orders and the distraction of the
appeal in respect of the
contravention proceedings. She otherwise pointed to the facts that since the
lapsing of the caveat there
was only a period of about four months to the issue
of the claim and that this occurred after she engaged her current solicitors
within weeks of the lapsing of that caveat and also that this application has
been brought within a further period of about one month.
[28] Further and in
express acknowledgement of her obligations as an ex parte applicant and as to
disclosure and candour, the applicant
specifically drew attention to the
following considerations:
(a) She does not yet have admissible direct evidence of the transfer and
provision of funds to the respondent to purchase the Brightwater
although, as is correctly pointed out, disclosure in respect of the proceedings
on her claim may be expected to do so in
support of the inference which is
otherwise open, on the presently known circumstances;
(b) There may be an
issue as to the efficacy of the terms of the property settlement orders in
protection of the applicant’s
interests and therefore as to the quality of
her legal advice in that regard. In particular, there is the issue as to
what was known about the position of the loan secured by the mortgage
over the Mountain Creek property at the time of the making
of those orders;
(c) On this application the applicant’s evidence does not descend
into detail as to any precise contributions which she made
during the course of
the marriage, to render it unconscionable for Mr David Latemore to assert
sole ownership of the Mountain Creek
property to the exclusion of the
[29] Such considerations potentially relate not only to the issue as to whether
there is a plain or only arguable caveatable interest
in this case but also to
the question of balance of convenience. As the applicant also conceded, on this
latter question, there
may also be an issue as to the potential efficacy of the
alternative relief that is claimed, such as for equitable damages. Further
there may be a need to consider and balance any relevant prejudice to the
respondent.
[30] However there is a limit to the extent to which all of
these considerations may be appropriately considered on an ex parte application
and in the absence of the opportunity of evidence and submissions from the
respondent.
[31] In support of the making of this
application, on an ex parte basis, the applicant points to the available
inferences as to the
respondent’s involvement in what are capable of being
characterised as Mr David Latemore’s breaches of trust and the
prospect that upon notice of this application and/or the applicant’s claim
there may be some step taken to further alienate
any proceeds of any such breach
of trust from the reach of the applicant. I accept in the circumstances, these
are legitimate and
real concerns and that it is appropriate to maintain the
status quo, at least until the applicant’s claims in respect of a
caveatable interest in the Brightwater Property and the wider considerations,
including as to the balance of convenience, may be
[32] Cognisant of the difficulties confronting the making of an ex
parte application, in these circumstances, the applicant contended
that a caveat
should be viewed as a form of statutory injunction, which in the first instance,
may be lodged without obtaining any
leave of a court, subject only to the right
of a caveatee to apply under s 127 of the LTA for removal of that caveat
and that upon
such an application the caveator would bear the onus of justifying
the continuation of the caveat. It was contended that the purpose
of the LTA was to effectively prevent vexatious or oppressive lodgements and it
was suggested that any order made under
s 129 of the LTA on an ex parte
basis, could be coupled with further directions to allow for the return of the
matter to this court,
for any application for removal of the caveat by the
respondent and in that way imbue the order with an interim characteristic.
[33] Whilst it may be accepted that an effect of s 129 of the LTA is in
prevention of vexatious and/or oppressive caveats, the difficulty
applicant’s approach is that s 129 of the LTA in context, is
concerned with the obtaining of the imprimatur of the
court to lodgement of the
further caveat and even though such an order may be subsequently set aside,
there is a potentially important
consideration, as was conceded on the hearing
by the applicant. That is, that a caveat when lodged pursuant to
the LTA, has the effect of preventing registration of any instrument affecting
the lot over which it is lodged from the date and
time of lodgement and whilst
s 130(1) of the LTA stands as protection for the interests of any person
who suffers loss or damage
as a result of a caveat lodged without reasonable
cause, application of that provision to a lodgement authorised under s 129
court, would appear at best as unlikely.
[34] Accordingly, the
alternative upon an adjournment of this application to enable service of it and
the applicant’s claim
and amended statement of claim and so that the
respondent has an opportunity to be heard in respect of the application and in
to protect the status quo, are orders in the nature of an interlocutory
injunction of a kind that might be made under UCPR 260A,
together with
appropriate undertakings of the usual kind.
[35] Like the power in s129 LTA,
a discretion is exercised as to the grant of an interim injunction and such
remedy may be allowed,
on the basis, as I have found appears on the presently
known circumstances, of a prima facie cause of action, or an arguable case,
the sense of raising a serious question to be
Further, the determination on an
ex-parte basis, as to whether it is just and convenient to make an interim order
and until any party
to be affected by the application has an opportunity to be
heard, is necessarily of a different character to determining that application
in light of that opportunity.
