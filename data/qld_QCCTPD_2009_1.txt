REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is an application brought to review a decision by the Plumbers and Drainers
Board made 22 October 2008 (conveyed to the applicant
by letter dated 24 October
2008) refusing the applicant’s application for a plumber and drainers
application for a review was brought pursuant to section 129 of the
and Drainage Act 2002
(“the Act”). The scope and powers of the
Tribunal upon a review appear at sections 130 and 131 of the Act and are –
(a) confirm the
original decision;
(b) amend the
original decision;
(c) substitute
another decision for the original decision; or
(d) set aside
the original decision and return the matter to the Board with the directions the
Tribunal considers appropriate.
Reasons for the Board’s decision
reasons for the Board’s decision appear from the Board’s statement
of reasons filed further to the Tribunal’s
directions.
reasons are as follows –
“1. Section 37 (a) of the Plumbing and Drainage Act 2002
(‘Act’) provides, inter alia, that an individual is entitled
licence if the Plumbers and Drainers Board (‘Board’) is satisfied
the individual has the qualifications and practical
experience required by
regulation for the licence.
Plumbing and Drainage Regulation 2003
(‘Regulations’) provides that the qualifications and practical
experience required for a plumbers licence are as stated
in Schedule 1 of the
Regulations.
3. Schedule 1, Item 1, Column 2 of the Regulations specifies the
qualifications required for a plumbers licence and Schedule 1, Item
1, Column 3
of the Regulations specifies the practical experience required for a
plumber’s licence.
4. When assessing an overseas licence applicant the Board uses the
Australian and New Zealand Reciprocity Association’s (ANZRA)
Plumbing Qualifications (the Guide). The Guide contains all the overseas
qualifications currently recognized by ANZRA for
the issue of a Certificate of
Registration, which entitles a person to work as a plumber in Australia and New
Zealand. An excerpt
of the relevant certificate of qualifications issued in the
United Kingdom is attached (Attachment A).
5. Mr Imoff does not hold any formal qualifications in plumbing from the
United Kingdom. It was noted by the Board that Mr Imoff did
registration in gas. This is not a recognised plumbing qualification in
Australia. Further, it is noted that Mr Imoff,
through his own written
application stated that he employed as a trainee plumber in 1988. Mr Imoff
provided no evidence to indicate
successful completion of this training.
6. In the absence of formal qualifications, Schedule 1, Item 1, Column 2
Item (d) of the Regulations specifies that the required qualification
least equivalent to the competencies in the apprenticeship for a plumber’s
licence a certificate of competency in
7. The documentary evidence provided to the Board by the Applicant does
not satisfy the required qualifications as prescribed by Schedule
Column 2 of the Regulation.
8. The documentary evidence provided to the Board by the Applicant does
not satisfy the required practical experience as prescribed
by Schedule 1, Item
1, Column 3 of the Regulations.
Plumbing and Drainage Regulation 2003
(‘Regulations’) provides that the qualifications and practical
experience required for a drainers licence are as stated
in Schedule 1 of the
Regulations.
10. Schedule 1, Item 2, Column 2 of the Regulations specifies the
qualifications required for a drainers licence and Schedule 1, Item
2, Column 3
of the Regulations specifies the practical experience required for a drainers
11. In the absence of formal qualifications, Schedule 1, Item 2, Column 2
Item (d) of the Regulations specifies that the required
qualification must be at
least equivalent to the competencies in the plumbing and draining apprenticeship
for a drainers licence
a certificate of competency in draining.
12. The documentary evidence provided to the Board by the Applicant does
not satisfy the required qualifications as prescribed by
Schedule 1, Item 2,
Column 2 of the Regulation or by application of RPL.
13. The documentary evidence provided to the Board by the Applicant does
not satisfy the required practical experience as prescribed
by Schedule 1, Item
2, Column 3 of the Regulations.”
Plumbing and Drainage Act 2002
Relevantly,
section 37 of the Act provides –
“37 Entitlement to licence
An individual is entitled to a licence if the board is, on application by
the individual, satisfied the individual—
(a) has the qualifications and practical experience required by
regulation for the licence; and
(b) has not had an interstate or New Zealand licence suspended or
cancelled.”
40 deals with what the Board must do upon receipt of an application for a
licence in that regard. Section 40(1) provides
“1. The board must consider the application and decide to
(a) licence the applicant; or
(b) provisionally licence the applicant for the class of licence applied for;
(c) refuse to licence the applicant.”
5(1) of the Regulations then provides that, for the purposes of section 37(a) of
the Act, the qualifications and practical
experience required for a Plumbers
licence and for a Drainers licence are as stated in schedule one.
for the required qualifications for both a plumbers licence and a drainers
licence, the alternatives are, in summary –
(a) competencies
in plumbing and drainage apprenticeship for a plumbers licence and relevant
post-trade courses approved by the board;
certificate of competency in plumbing/drainage; or
(c) foreign
licence as a plumber; or
qualification at least equivalent to the qualification mentioned in paragraphs
(a) or (b).
for the required experience, again as to both a plumber’s licence and a
drainer’s licence, what is required is at least
one year’s practical
plumbing experience or its equivalence.
requirements are cumulative.
Applicant’s evidence
In making his application to the Board the applicant produced –
(i) a letter
dated 23 March 2003 from the managing director of his former employee in the
United Kingdom, R Imhoff and Son Limited,
which sets out a chronology of the
progression of plumbing work undertaken by the applicant from January 1988
apparently until about
(ii) various
references from persons, for whom the applicant had performed work in the United
is clear from the evidence produced by the applicant to the Board is that the
applicant did not have the qualifications required
by schedule one to the Act
for the purposes of being granted either a plumbing or draining licence pursuant
to section 37(a) and
to experience noted in schedule one, all that the Board had before it was the
said letter, dated 23 March 2003, from R Imhoff and
Son Ltd. On the basis of
that material the Board considered that the applicant did not meet the schedule
one requirements for practical
experience. In arriving at that decision it must
be assumed that the Board considered that the experience noted in the letter was
not the equivalence of one years’ practical experience in either
discipline, as noted in paragraph (a) of column three of schedule
one. There is
no evidence from either party as to the practical plumbing/draining experience
against which the letter could be assessed
for such equivalence. In any event,
the applicant bears the onus in that regard. Nonetheless, without the
accompanying qualifications,
as mentioned in schedule one (a lack as to which is
common ground), the Board would have had no option but to refuse the issue of
licence to this applicant which, of course, it did.
Provisional licence
As noted, section 40(1) of the Act sets out what the Board must decide when
considering an application. That decision must be either
the applicant; or
Provisionally
licence the applicant for the class of licence applied for; or
to licence the applicant.
Board, of course, made a decision under (3) above, and in so doing opted against
option one.
there is no specific comment in the Board’s reasons that it considered
option two as a possibility. Whilst that might
not have been envisaged by the
applicant in his application to the Board, section 40(1) of the Act, in my view,
suggests that option
two would be available in any application for an
unconditional licence.
Accordingly,
one would have thought that option two should have been specifically addressed
in the Board decision and, if thought
appropriate, discounted, particularly as
this applicant was relying solely upon his experience through his employment in
option of a provisional licence now becomes relevant, in my view, because the
applicant produced with his review application to
the Tribunal a detailed ten
page account of the plumbing/drainage work the applicant had performed, whilst
working for R Imhoff and
Son Ltd., Building Contractors. The experience
detailed in that document included how the applicant went about various tasks.
way of explanation, in paragraph five of the applicant’s review
application, filed at this Tribunal, the applicant noted
with respect to this
“5. When I applied for the plumbers and drainers licence
I was not asked to produce the paperwork to prove my work experience,
now provided this with this appeal application as I feel that it is relevant to
passing I should note that, relevantly, in paragraph six of the same application
the applicant concedes as to his lack of the qualifications
required by schedule
one to the Act. That lack of qualification is a condition precedent to the
operation of section 40(2)(b)(ii)
which sets down the circumstances in which a
provisional licence could be approved by the Board. That sub-paragraph is as
“(ii) the board reasonably considers the applicant does
not have the qualifications required under section 37(a), but does have
practical experience to be able to perform work under the provisional
It is clear then that the Board has not had the opportunity to consider the ten
page document produced by the applicant in these
proceedings. I should note
that the ten page document was prepared by the applicant for the purposes of the
Department of Employment
and Workplace Relations assessing the applicant’s
skills for the purposes of the Migration Act. It would appear that the relevant
Department considered those skills to be suitable for the occupation of general
plumber in terms of the Migration Act, and therefore
sufficient for the grant of
the relevant skilled - independent visa for permanent residence in Australia.
such an assessment is by no means binding upon the Board, I consider that, as
the ten page document was not produced to the
Board, and that the Department of
Employment and Workplace Relations saw fit to approve the skills nominated in
that document under
the occupation general plumber, the Board should have the
opportunity of considering that document in terms of whether the Board
prepared to grant to this applicant a provisional licence in terms of section
40(1)(b) of the Act.
Accordingly,
pursuant to my powers under section 131 of the Act, and more particularly
131(1)(d), I set aside the decisions of the
Board in respect of each of the
applications for a plumbers licence and a drainers licence and return the matter
to the board with
the direction that it consider, in light of the ten page
document produced in these proceedings and any further material, that it
considers relevant, whether a provisional licence should be granted to the
