12 May 2025 I heard three motions in these proceedings, being the
plaintiff’s notices of motion dated 11 September 2024 (
11 September
2024 motion
) and 25 March 2025 (
25 March 2025 motion
) as well as the
defendant’s notice of motion dated 3 March 2025 (
3 March 2025
). In summary:
(1) By the 11 September 2024 motion, the plaintiff sought orders dismissing,
permanently staying, or otherwise striking out two cross-claims
brought by the
defendant pursuant to rr 13.4 and 14.28 of the
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules
Civil Procedure Act 2005
). The plaintiff had previously filed a motion on 19 August 2024
seeking those orders in respect of the first cross-claim and the
11 September
2024 motion was described as an ‘amended motion’ which amended that
earlier motion to seek the same relief
in respect of the second cross-claim.
(2) By the 25 March 2025 motion, the plaintiff sought an order restraining the
defendant from ‘selling, providing security
on, further encumbering or any
way dealing, selling or otherwise dealing with her 60% share of the Haymarket
(3) By the 3 March 2025 motion, the defendant sought leave to file
an amended defence originally filed without leave on 12 February 2025

Amended Defence.

), I dismissed the two
motions brought by the plaintiff, being the 11 September 2024 motion and the 25
March 2025 motion, and granted
the defendant’s motion, being the 3 March
2025 motion. The orders made on 12 August 2025 were:
1. The plaintiff’s notices of motion dated
11 September 2024 and 25 March 2025 are dismissed with costs.
2. Leave is granted
nunc pro tunc
for the defendant to
file the Amended Defence filed 12 February 2025.
3. The defendant has leave to withdraw such admissions as are
withdrawn by the said Amended Defence.
4. In relation to the defendant’s motion dated
3 March 2025, order that the parties’ costs of the motion will be
in the cause.
5. Grant leave to each party to approach the Associate of
Richmond J within 14 days by email if either party wishes to seek a different
costs order to those set out in these orders.
parties took up the invitation in order 5. The defendant did so by filing
another notice of motion dated 26 August 2025 (

That motion seeks the following orders (together

1. An Order that the Plaintiff’s motion filed on 19
August 2024 be dismissed with costs.
2. An Order that the Plaintiff pay the costs of the
Defendant’s motion filed on 3 March 2025.
3. An Order that Order 4 of the Orders made on 12 August 2025
be vacated.
4. An Order pursuant to UCPR 42.7 that the costs ordered by
Orders 1 and 2 of these Orders and the costs ordered by Order 1 of
made on 12 August 2025 be payable forthwith.
5. Costs of this motion, payable forthwith.
support of the motion, the defendant provided written submissions on 12
September 2025 and relied on an affidavit in support by
her solicitor, Ms
Jessica Prats, sworn on 26 August 2025 as well as two affidavits of service
dated 19 and 22 September 2025. The
plaintiff, who is now self-represented,
filed (with leave) written submissions dated 26 September 2025 opposing the
proposed orders
and, relevantly, sought orders (1) that the determination of
costs of the motions heard on 12 May 2025 be reserved until final hearing
plaintiff’s proposed costs order
); and (2) that a ‘freezing
order’ in respect of rental income from the Haymarket property which the
plaintiff says has
been in place since July 2023, be varied to permit the income
to be released to the defendant as to 60% and the plaintiff as to 40%,
this distribution continue monthly until final determination of the proceedings.
propose to deal only with the plaintiff’s proposed costs orders and
submissions related thereto, as only these issues relate
to the motion presently
under consideration. The matter regarding the variation to the so-called
‘freezing order’ will
need to be brought by way of a notice of
motion to allow the defendant a proper opportunity to respond, if agreement
cannot be reached,
particularly as it is not clear to me what ‘freezing
order’ is being referred to.
parties were content for me to deal with the costs issues on the papers. For the
reasons that follow, the defendant is entitled
to her proposed orders 1, 4 and
5, subject to a discount in relation to proposed order 5 to reflect her failure
in relation to proposed
orders 2 and 3.
Consideration
will consider the defendant’s proposed orders first and then address the
plaintiff’s proposed costs order. These reasons
assume familiarity with
and maintain the same abbreviations used in the primary
Defendant’s proposed order 1
Defendant’s
proposed order 1 refers to the ‘Plaintiff’s motion filed on 19
August 2024’ (
19 August 2024 motion
). That motion was amended (and
subsumed) by the 11 September 2024 motion rather than being a different notice
of motion altogether.
Reflecting this, at the hearing the plaintiff moved on the
11 September 2024 motion and not the 19 August 2024 motion. Order 1 made
August 2025 provides that the 11 September 2024 motion is dismissed with costs.
While the defendant accepts that proposed order
1 is strictly unnecessary it is
sought to put beyond doubt that the costs ordered include the costs of the
motion filed 19 August
the 11 September 2024 motion was dismissed with costs, the defendant will be
entitled to recover costs which have reasonably
been incurred in the conduct of
the litigation in relation to the motion (see eg
Oshlack v Richmond River
[1998] HCA 11
(1998) 193 CLR 72
[1998] HCA 11)
which in my view includes
the earlier motion which was subsumed into that motion. That was my intention
when the order was made.
Nevertheless, given the degree of disputation between
the parties, it is desirable to avoid any doubt as to the scope of Order 1
on 12 August 2025. Accordingly, I will make an order amending Order 1 made on 12
August 2025 so that it reads: ‘The plaintiff’s
notices of motion
dated 11 September 2024 (including the motion filed on 19 August 2024 which
it amends) and 25 March 2025 are dismissed
with costs’.
Defendant’s proposed orders 2 and 3
proposed orders 2 and 3 the defendant seeks to replace Order 4 made on 12 August
2025 (that the parties’ costs of the 3 March
2025 motion will be costs in
the cause) with an order that the plaintiff pays the defendant’s costs of
that motion.
effect of Order 4 made on 12 August 2025 for an award of ‘costs in the
cause’ in respect of the 3 March 2025 motion,
is that the costs of that
motion will be only payable to whichever party is ultimately successful in the
proceedings. An order for
costs in the cause is essentially the default rule for
interlocutory applications pursuant to r 42.7 of the UCPR. I note that such
orders have been made in applications for leave to amend pleadings: see eg
Joudo v Joudo
[2024] NSWSC 232
Shelteo Pty Ltd v
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd
[2021] NSWSC 224
support of proposed orders 2 and 3, the defendant relied on
Public Trustee v
(1921) 38 WN (NSW) 142
where a party held to have unreasonably opposed
an application for leave to amend was ordered to pay the costs of the
application
and the costs of the amendment were made the costs in the cause. The
defendant submitted that the plaintiff has been unreasonable
in her opposition
by not giving the requested consent, not providing any reasons for refusing to
do so, and when finally doing so
the reasons were difficult to understand and
lacking in substance.
particular, the defendant submits that the plaintiff’s opposition to the 3
March 2025 motion was unreasonable given the following:
(1) there were previous court directions made by Kunc J on 14 February 2025
which ordered the plaintiff to consider the proposed
amendments in the Amended
Defence and signify any consent or opposition and that the motion was to be
filed if consent was not forthcoming
within the agreed period. However, no
response to these proposed amendments were made in time, which necessitated the
need for the
motion to be filed even when the Amended Defence itself was already
filed on 12 February 2025 (albeit without leave) and the trial
affidavit as well
as all supporting exhibits were served even earlier on 8 February 2025;
(2) further, when a response was finally made on 27 March 2025 refusing consent
to the amendments, that response supplied no reasons
for that refusal. This was
said to have caused the defendant substantial prejudice as she had to prepare
submissions in chief dealing
with all of the amendments without any notice of
the grounds upon which the plaintiff objected to them; and
(3) lastly, when the basis of these objections later came to light in subsequent
written submissions by the plaintiff to the Court
and during oral argument on 12
May 2025, they were said to be 'difficult to understand and lacking substance'
and therefore the amendments
should not have been opposed in the first place.
am not persuaded that these matters justify a change to Order 4 made on 12
August 2025.
defendant required leave to amend her defence under
Procedure Act 2005
(NSW). She also required leave under r 12.6 of the UCPR
to withdraw the admissions previously made in her original defence, as the
plaintiff did not give consent. Given the nature of the admissions which were
sought to be withdrawn, it is not surprising that the
plaintiff did not give her
consent. In my view the plaintiff was entitled to require the defendant to
satisfy the court that in all
the circumstances the grant of leave to withdraw
the admissions previously made was appropriate because, irrespective of whether
the plaintiff opposed the application, the defendant had an independent
obligation to satisfy the court that the withdrawal of the
admissions should be
Media Ocean Ltd v Optus Mobile Pty Ltd (No 6)
[2009] FCA 1319
defendant also needed to explain to the court how it came about that the Amended
Defence came to be filed, in error, without leave.
She did so by an affidavit
from her solicitor, Ms Prats, explaining how the error within her office came
light of these matters, I consider that it was not unreasonable for the
plaintiff to require the defendant to satisfy the court
that the relief sought
in the 3 March 2025 motion be granted, irrespective of whether the plaintiff
could establish good reasons
to oppose it.
the main reason put forward by the defendant as to why she should have her costs
of the 3 March 2025 motion is because she
had to ‘prepare submissions in
chief dealing with the whole motion and each of the amendments without notice of
[the] grounds
of the Plaintiff’s objection to any part of it’.
However, in reality, the defendant’s written submissions in support
3 March 2025 motion did not refer to the motion in any detail, and very little
time was actually spent on it at the hearing.
I am therefore not satisfied that
the plaintiff’s conduct caused the defendant to incur significant further
costs than she
otherwise would have done.
these reasons, I consider on balance that fairness dictates that the
responsibility for the costs of the 3 March 2025 motion be
determined by the
ultimate outcome of the proceedings. Thus, I consider that it is appropriate to
leave Order 4 of the primary judgment
undisturbed.
Defendant’s proposed order 4
Defendant’s
proposed order 4 seeks the costs under proposed orders 1 and 2, as well as those
under Order 1 of the primary judgment,
to be ‘payable forthwith’. In
light of what I have already said, the only remaining issue is whether costs
under Order
1 made on 12 August 2025 be payable forthwith.
42.7 of the UCPR provides relevantly:
(1) Unless the court orders otherwise, the costs of any application or other
step in any proceedings, including ... are to be paid
and otherwise dealt with
in the same way as the general costs of the proceedings.
(2) Unless the court orders otherwise, costs referred to in subrule (1) do not
become payable until the conclusion of the proceedings.
the present case, what the defendant seeks is for the court to exercise its
discretion under r 42.7(2) to make an order that the
costs under Order 1 made on
12 August 2025 be paid forthwith rather than at the conclusion of the
proceedings which is the usual
position for costs of interlocutory proceedings
in accordance with rr 42.7(1) and (2).
guiding principle in exercising that discretion is whether, in all the
circumstances of the case, the demands of justice require
v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (No 2)
Fiduciary Ltd v
Morningstar Research
(2002) 55 NSWLR 1
[2002] NSWSC 432
. Relevant factors in this
regard include whether: (1) the proceedings giving rise to the order are
sufficiently self-contained and
discrete from the main proceeding yet to be
heard to make it just for an actual payment to be made in the meantime; (2)
been some unreasonable conduct by the party against whom the costs
were ordered (with ‘unreasonable’ conduct not necessarily
there to be an abuse of process or misconduct:
[2023] NSWSC 208
); and (3) there is still likely to be a
considerable time before the conclusion of the proceedings:
Morningstar Research
at [11]-[13].
potentially relevant matter to the exercise of the discretion is the financial
position of the parties, which goes to the
degree of financial hardship which
such an order may cause the party bound to comply with it, balanced against the
prejudice which
may be suffered by the party entitled to the costs due to delay
in their payment:

; G E Dal Pont,
(5th ed, LexisNexis, 2021), [14.51].
is not necessary for all of the factors mentioned above to be present before an
order that costs be payable forthwith could be
Consideration
accept the defendant’s submission that the three factors referred to at
[23] above are present here. As to the first factor,
the motions to which Order
1 on 12 August 2025 relates, being the strike out/stay application and the
freezing order application,
are of a discrete nature. Orders for costs to be
payable forthwith have been made against applicants in unsuccessful strike out
applications
Watson v Kriticos (Cost of Summary Judgment Application)
[2021] FCA 917)
and unsuccessful stay applications (eg
WLD Practice
Holdings Pty Ltd, in respect of WLD Practice Holdings Trust v Sara Stockham
[2020] NSWSC 576)
, as well as unsuccessful applications for freezing orders
Zhao v Bonheur Holdings Pty Ltd atf Bonheur Holdings Trust (No 2)
[2020] NSWSC 648).
to the second factor, I accept there was some unreasonable conduct part of the
plaintiff in the prosecution of those motions. As
I noted in the primary
judgment, the plaintiff advanced many grounds for relief in respect of the 11
September 2024 motion but provided
very little or no support for most of those
grounds, either by way of submissions or evidence and many of the grounds were
repetitive.
to the third factor, this is a protracted piece of litigation which is likely to
remain on foot for a considerable period of time.
As foreshadowed in her
submissions, the plaintiff has now filed another notice of motion dated 23
October 2025 seeking leave to amend
her statement of claim, plus a further six
weeks to serve evidence and submissions in support. No date has been set down
hearing of that notice of motion, but if such relief is granted the
defendant will need further time to file further evidence in
response to the
extra claims. There is a history of delay on the part of both parties in
bringing the matter to a stage where it
can be listed for final hearing and the
latest motion of the plaintiff will have the effect of pushing the trial date
even further
into the indeterminate future.
relation to the financial position of the defendant, the affidavit of Ms Prats
in support of the 26 August 2025 motion, together
with the evidence of the
defendant in her affidavit dated 8 February 2025, establishes that the defendant
is a junior medical officer
with a current annual income of $68,000 per year, is
not in receipt of rental income from either the Haymarket property or the
properties, has no other significant assets or income, and is not
presently able to pay her legal costs of the proceedings. She will
significant hardship if the costs are not paid forthwith.
plaintiff raised a number of matters against an order making costs payable
she submits that the making of orders requiring costs to be paid at this stage
would stifle her ability to continue these proceedings,
as she is currently in
‘precarious financial circumstances’ and would be unable to meet any
substantial costs order without
jeopardising her ability to prosecute her
statement of claim (including her proposed amendment to the statement of claim)
defend the cross-claims.
plaintiff also submitted that making a costs order at this stage would
effectively deny the ‘second plaintiff’ (her
son, Harold, who is a
minor without any independent financial capacity) access to justice. However,
this latter submission is misplaced
as Harold is not a party to the
proceedings.
accept that the potential stultification of a party’s ability to pursue
proceedings to finality is a factor going against
the discretion to make an
order for costs to be payable forthwith (see eg
Re Elsmore Resources Ltd
[2014] NSWSC 1390
). However, the plaintiff has not adduced any
evidence to establish this. Although she claims to be in a ‘precarious
situation’, the only matters put forward in support of that
claim are that she has paid the deceased’s funeral expenses
$58,787.50 without reimbursement from his estate, tuition fees and living
expenses for her son, Harold, in unspecified
amounts and the tuition expenses
she provided to the defendant (which are subject to the dispute in the present
proceedings). However,
she has not put evidence before the court as to her
overall financial situation (including her assets and income, and those from
whom she is entitled to financial support). Nor has she established that her
financial position is ‘precarious’ or threatens
her ability to
effectively pursue her claims for the remainder of these proceedings.
the plaintiff has not explained how her financial circumstances will improve in
a way which will allow her to fund the proceedings
going forward. Her
unexplained financial difficulty is no justification for the court to refuse to
make an order that costs be paid
forthwith if the proceedings are going to
collapse for lack of funding in any event:
at [107]-[109].
the plaintiff asks that her current poor health issues in relation to her
pregnancy should be taken into account. However,
it has not been shown how this
is relevant to the question whether costs should be paid forthwith in
circumstances where there is
no evidence of her financial position as noted
the plaintiff submits that the defendant’s conduct has substantially
protracted this litigation and increased the costs
for both parties. As noted
above, there are aspects in which both parties have delayed the conduct of the
litigation but ultimately
I do not see that as being relevant to the present
the above reasons, I consider that in all the circumstances of the case, it is
in the interests of justice that the costs payable
under Order 1 made on 12
August 2025 should be payable forthwith.
Defendant’s
proposed order 5
defendant seeks her costs of the 26 August 2025 motion, such costs to be payable
forthwith. The defendant has succeeded in respect
of substantially all the
relief sought in the motion except for proposed orders 2 and 3. I see no reason
why costs of the motion
should not follow the event, so that the defendant is
entitled to her costs of the motion, subject to a discount of 15% to reflect
failure relation to proposed orders 2 and 3.
is recognised that in circumstances where there has been a mixed outcome in
proceedings an apportionment of costs may be appropriate
and one way of
achieving this is to have the successful party’s costs reduced by the
application of a discount if it would
be unfair to allow the person to get the
whole of his or her costs:
Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd (No
(1998) 30 ACSR 20
light of the defendant’s failure in relation to proposed orders 2 and 3,
it would in my view be unfair to allow her to get
the whole of her costs of the
motion and it is appropriate to apply a discount to reflect this. Bearing in
mind that the question
of apportionment is a matter of discretion and that a
relatively broad-brush approach may be taken, I consider that a discount of
is appropriate, being my assessment of the relative time spent on that issue in
the defendant’s submissions and evidence
on the motion and its relative
significance in the conduct of the motion.
the same reasons already given in respect of the defendant’s proposed
order 4, it is in the interests of justice that those
costs also be paid
Plaintiff’s proposed costs orders
relation to costs, the plaintiff proposed that costs in relation to all orders
made in the primary judgment be reserved until final
hearing. In support of
this, she advanced several very brief global submissions, with the only salient
submission being on the matter
of hardship which I have considered above. In
light of my previous reasons as to why the original orders should stand, it
that I reject her proposed orders in relation to costs. It remains the
case that the plaintiff was substantially unsuccessful in
relation to the three
motions in the primary proceedings and that as a matter of principle the
defendant should be entitled to her
costs of those motions, subject to what has
been said above.
Court orders as follows:
(1) Order 1 of the Orders made on 12 August 2025 is amended by inserting after
“11 September 2024” the words “(including

(2) Order that the costs ordered by Order 1 of the Orders made on 12 August 2025
be payable forthwith.
(3) The plaintiff to pay 85% of the defendant’s costs of the

(4) Otherwise dismiss the defendant’s motion filed 26 August 2025.
