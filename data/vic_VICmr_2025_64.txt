Reasons for Decision
Background to review
[date], the Agency accepted a request from the Applicant seeking access to the
following documents:
I seek access to the following document(s)

In reference to Planning Application: [application number] for [address in
1. The planning application documents including registered land survey
2. The building permit including registered land survey.
Agency identified two documents falling within the terms of the
Applicant’s request and decided to grant access to both
documents in part,
exempting certain information under
section 33(1).
The Agency’s decision

application
Applicant sought review by the Information Commissioner under
section 49A(1)
the Agency’s decision to refuse access.
Applicant advised OVIC of three issues they wanted to be addressed. These issues
1) A decision to redact information in part, or exempt
documents in full.
2) A decision to not waive or reduce the application fee.
3) A decision to defer access to a document until a later date.
number 2 will be addressed independently from this review, with OVIC reference
number [reference].
issue number 3, in further correspondence, the Applicant clarified their
I would like to make an additional complaint regarding:
inadequate search for documents by an agency or Minister
accordance with
section 61B(3)
, this concern will be addressed within this
Applicant’s concerns regarding adequacy of
Applicant complained that the Agency had failed to identify all documents
falling within the terms of their request, stating:
...if the agency
(Maribyrnong City Council) have only provided 2 pages of the Building Permit,
then this is incomplete and missing
the majority of the contents attached to the
Building Permit Application.
A building permit application should contain an attached copy of;
the approved
planning permit application
the building
licenced land
surveys, etc.
response to OVIC’s enquiries, the Agency advised:
(a) Documents that support the building permit were not part of the
Applicant’s original request. To obtain those documents
the Applicant
would need to make an additional FOI request.
(b) Some of the documents that support the building permit would be the planning
permit and endorsed plans. These are available for
a fee under the
and Environment Act 1987
14(1)(a) of the FOI Act states:
(1) A person is not entitled to
obtain access under this Part to—
(a) a document which contains information that is open to public access as
part of a public register or is published on an Internet
site that is owned or
maintained by an agency or otherwise, whether or not that access is free of
charge or subject to a fee or other
on the Agency’s response, I am satisfied the Agency:
(a) undertook a thorough and diligent search for documents within the scope of
the request;
(b) additional documents the Applicant is seeking can be provided either via
another FOI request or
(c) are available for a fee and therefore subject to 14(1)(a) of the FOI Act.
Accordingly,
I consider the Applicant’s concern as listed under issue number 3 has been
fully pursued and there is no need to
make further enquiries or take further
action under the FOI Act in relation to this particular
is open to the Applicant to make a new request for the building permit
supporting documents, and to access other planning documents

on my review of the Agency’s decision to refuse access to information in
the documents located now follows which
responds to issue 1 as raised by the
Initial view
Agency was provided with an initial view that certain information it exempted
was not personal affairs information, or that it
was information that would not
be unreasonable to release.
response the Agency provided a second set of marked up documents, but did not
elect to make a fresh decision.
Review of exemptions
Section 33(1) – Documents affecting personal privacy of third
more information about section 33(1), see the FOI
Guidelines.
33(1) protects an individual’s privacy where their right to privacy
outweighs the public interest in disclosing their
information.
This will only occur
when disclosing the individual’s personal affairs information is
unreasonable.
document or information is exempt under section 33(1) if two conditions are
(a) the document or information relates to the ‘personal affairs’ of
a natural person (living or deceased); and
(b) disclosure of that personal affairs information is unreasonable in all the
circumstances.
Do the documents contain personal affairs information of individuals other
concept of personal affairs information is broad. Information will relate to the
personal affairs of a person if it ‘concerns
or affects that person as an
individual’.
This includes
information relating to health, private behaviour, home life, or personal or
family relationships of
individuals.
document will indirectly disclose personal affairs information if it contains
information from which any person’s identity,
address or location can
reasonably be determined. This means that a document can be exempt under section
33(1) where the document
itself does not contain personal affairs information,
but its disclosure would reveal personal affairs information.
affairs information can be revealed or indirectly disclosed by connecting or
linking the information in the disclosed document
with other information
available to the applicant.
am satisfied the documents contain personal affairs information of third parties
in the form of names, addresses, signatures and
other information that can
identify third parties. However, I am not satisfied all the information exempted
by the Agency is personal
affairs information. This includes an outline of the
plan in Document 1, and information that I don’t think could be used to
identify a person in Document 2, including insurance and cost information.
I have decided the information is personal affairs, I have further considered
whether it would be unreasonable to release it.
Would disclosure
of the personal affairs information be unreasonable?
determining whether disclosure of the personal affairs information would be
unreasonable in the circumstances, I have considered
the following factors:
(a) the nature of the personal affairs information
(b) the circumstances in which the information was obtained
(c) the extent to which the information is available to the public
(d) the Applicant’s interest in the information
(e) whether any public or important interest would be promoted by release of the
information
(f) whether the individuals to whom the information relates object, or would be
likely to object, to the release of the information
(g) whether disclosure of the information would or would be reasonably likely to
endanger the life or physical safety of any person.
have decided the release of most of the personal affairs information remaining
in the documents would be unreasonable to release
for the following
(a) the information was collected by the Agency due to its regulatory
(b) in these circumstances I consider the people named in the documents would
expect their information to remain private
(c) the information is not publicly available
(d) I do not consider any public or important interest would be served by its
making this decision, I note there is no dispute as to the authenticity of the
documents, and that other relevant information has
been released to the
have decided to release a small amount of personal affairs information where I
can see that it is publicly available information,
this includes the address of
the subject location, a mobile telephone number (that is publicly available) and
PO Box address that
relates more closely to a business than a person.

documents provided to the Agency with this decision.
Section 25 – Deletion of exempt or irrelevant information
25 requires an Agency to grant access to an edited copy of a document where it
is practicable to delete exempt or irrelevant
information and the Applicant
agrees to receiving such a copy.
have decided it is practicable for the Agency to delete the exempt information,
because it would not require substantial time and
effort, and the edited
documents would retain meaning.

33(1); however, I have decided to release further
information where it is not
