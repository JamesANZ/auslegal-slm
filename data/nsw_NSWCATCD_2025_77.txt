REASONS FOR DECISION
is an application to vary the costs order made in the substantive decision.
substantive decision is dated 28 May 2025. Written reasons were provided
comprising of 64 pages. This costs decision is to be
read in conjunction with
the substantive decision.
substantive decision involved a dispute under the
(NSW) (HB Act). The applicants are homeowners and the respondent is a licensed
applicants are successors in title who purchased the dwelling in about April
2021. The respondent constructed the dwelling.
applicants brought proceedings in the Tribunal for breach of statutory
warranties under s 18B of the HB Act, by way of the extension
of those statutory
warranties to successors in title during the relevant limitation period.
a contested hearing, the Tribunal:
(1) Rejected the builder’s defence under the principles in
[2009] NSWCA 224
; (2009) 15 ANZ Insurance Cases 224 that a
pre-purchase building inspection report was sufficient to sever the casual nexus
any breach of statutory warranties and loss or damage of the owners.
(2) Found that a defect in respect of water ingress involving the balcony/front
façade and front window involved a major defect
under s 18E of the HB
(3) Found that a defect in respect of water ingress involving the dining room
window was a major defect under s 18E of the HB Act.
(4) Found that a defect in respect of water ingress into the living room corner
was a major defect under s 18E of the HB Act.
(5) Rejected the owners claim that alleged failed waterproofing over the garage
was a major defect under s 18E of the HB Act.
(6) Found that inadequate falls to tiling in the bathroom of the granny flat and
absence of a water stop angle in the shower area
was a major defect under s 18E
of the HB Act.
(7) Found that a work order under s 48O of the HB Act for the builder to rectify
defects was the appropriate remedy. Of the 4 defect
items, the Tribunal accepted
the method of rectification of the owners expert over the builder’s expert
on most of the items.
(8) Found that
Civil and Administrative Tribunal Rules
(NSW) (NCAT Rules) applied to the proceedings.
(9) Made an order that the builder pay the owners’ costs as agreed or
assessed, but imposed a condition that any party may
apply to vary the costs
order in the manner set out in the orders.
builder has made an application to vary the costs order.
builder filed and served submissions in chief and documents on 4 June 2025.

10 June 2025.
party opposes the Tribunal considering the costs application under
Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013
(NSW) (NCAT
Position of the Parties
builder submits the appropriate costs orders are either:
(1) Builder pay the owners’ costs to 16 July 2023 on the ordinary basis;
and owners pay the builders costs from 17 July 2023
on an indemnity basis. The
builder relies upon a Calderbank offer; or
(2) Each party bear their own costs, except for and adjournment application
granted on 9 February 2024 for which the owners should
pay the builder’s
“costs thrown away”.
owners submit that the costs order should remain that the builder pay their
costs of the proceedings, but it be clarified that
costs are on a party/party or
‘ordinary’ basis.
Builder’s Costs Submissions
builder does not dispute that r 38 of the
Civil and Administrative Tribunal
(NSW) applies to the proceedings.
builder’s submissions refer to the principles applicable to
offers, and attach a copy of various correspondence .
are 2 letters from the builder to the owners headed “Without prejudice
save as to costs”.
first is 23 June 2023. It does not contain an offer. It refers to alleged
“fundamental problems” in the owners claim,
and asserts (a) the
owners are precluded from litigating for non-major defects by reason of s 18E of
the HB Act; (b) the findings
set out in the pre-purchase inspection report of Mr
Xue of Jims Building Services is “materially deficient” and
“speculative”;
and (c) there is “no reliable evidence”
of major defects. The letter “invites” the owners to “conduct
a proper review of you evidence and provide us with a Scott Schedule setting out
only alleged defects which are considered to be
major defects as defined by s
18E(4) of the HBA”.
second is dated 17 July 2023. That letter states the proceedings have been
listed for hearing on 19 September 2023. The offer
’ terms is that the builder will:
(1) “Investigate” the major defects identified in the Jim’s
Building Inspection report dated 16 April 2021 (items
2.01 to 2.10) to
“determine the cause and extent of any defective and non-complying work
undertaken” by the builder;
(2) Undertake “all necessary” remedial work found in respect of
major defects identified in the report of Jim’s
Building Inspections to
“an acceptable industry standard;” and
(3) The owners proceedings are withdrawn under s 48I(2) of the HB Act, with no
order as to costs, and the parties “are to enter
into a formal deed of
release which reflects the above terms and the completion of the investigation
and remedial works” by
the builder “within a reasonable period of
offer was open for 14 days.
owners responded to that letter on 28 July 2023. The letter is under their own
names, and not a firm of Solicitors. The owners
rejected the builder’s
offer of 17 July 2023. Reasons are given. Those reasons include the builder not
complying with a work
order issued by NSW Fair Trading on 5 December 2022 and
previously making “empty promises”. The owners made an offer
they would accept $120,000 in full and final settlement of the dispute. That
offer was open for 14 days.
builder’s submissions also contain interlocutory orders of the Tribunal.
28 August 2023, Ziegler SM refused the owners’ application for an
adjournment of the hearing on 19 September 2023. Written
reasons were provided.
No costs order was made.
12 September 2023, Robertson SM refused the owners’ second application for
an adjournment of the hearing on 19 September
2023. Written reasons were
provided. No costs order was made.
19 September 2023, Goldstein SM adjourned the hearing, and made procedural
directions that included the builder having the opportunity
to file and serve
further evidence in response to the evidence of the owners; evidence in reply;
and joint expert report. Both parties
were granted leave for legal
representation. There was no order that any party pay the other party’s
costs by reason of the
adjournment.
9 February 2024, Rosser PM (at a procedural direction hearing caused by
non-compliance) adjourned the hearing that had been set
down on 5 March 2024.
The owners were granted leave to reply on the expert report of Mr Xue dated 21
December 2023 and the Points
of Claim lodged on 16 January 2024. There was an
extension of the timetable for previous procedural directions regarding the
and serving of evidence and a joint expert report. Rosser PM made further
direction for the preparation of the matter for hearing,
including a joint
Tender Bundle.
Importantly,
Rosser PM made the following order:
“7. The applicants are to pay the respondent’s costs thrown away of
and incidental to the granting of leave to rely on
Mr Xue’s report and the
adjournment of the hearing on 5 March 2024, on the ordinary basis, as agreed or
builder submits that the owners unreasonably refused to accept the
letter of 17 July 2023, such that the builder
should pay the owners costs to 17 July 2023, but after that the owners pay the
costs on an indemnity basis.
the builder submits that there are “special circumstances” under s
60(3) of the NCAT Act such that the Tribunal
should make an order in favour of
the builder. The “special circumstances” under s 60(2) of the NCAT
Act are that (a)
the builder incurred costs by reason of the adjournment of two
hearing dates; (b) the owners continued to press “non-major
defects”; and (c) the owners continued to press “a money order
pursuant to s 48MA (sic) of the HBA, in which the Tribunal
Owners’ Costs Submissions
owners submit that it was reasonable for the owners to reject the Calderbank
offer of 23 June 2023. The owners further submit
(1) The builder’s submissions make no reference to its failed
[2009] NSWCA 224
; (2009) 15 ANZ Insurance Cases 224 (
(2) The hearing was adjourned on 19 September 2023 because the builder raised
Allianz v Waterbrook
defence for the first time.
Builder’s Costs Submissions in Reply
builder repeats its submission that the
offer of 17 July 2023
(read in conjunction with the letter of 23 June 2023) was unreasonably rejected.
The builder submits that the
“ordinary costs rules apply” but the
matters raised by the respondent mean the Tribunal should find there are
circumstances” under s 60(2) of the NCAT Act to award the
builder costs; or in the alternative that each party bear its own
costs other
than the costs thrown away by reason of the adjournment orders made by Rosser
builder also submits that it was reasonable for it to raise the
defence. The builder refers to various periods in the litigation
where the owners were represented by different law
Consideration
is appropriate to dispense with a hearing under s 50(2) of the NCAT Act and
determine the issue of costs on the papers.
submissions of the builder do not reflect the applicable costs principles,
because the submissions conflate r 38 of the NCAT Rules
and Sections 60(2)-(3)
of the NCAT Act.
the Tribunal pointed out in paragraphs [209]-[210] of the substantive decision,
the starting point is s 60 of the NCAT Act. However,
there is an exception to
the principle that parties are to bear their own costs unless ‘special
circumstances’ are established
(ss 60(1)-(3) of the NCAT Act).
exception is where r 38 of the NCAT Rules applies. Rule 38 of the NCAT Act
states as follows:
38 Costs in Consumer and Commercial Division of the
(1) This rule applies to proceedings for the exercise of functions of the
Tribunal that are allocated to the Consumer and Commercial
Division of the
(2) Despite section 60 of the Act, the Tribunal may award costs in
proceedings to which this rule applies even in the absence of
circumstances warranting such an award if—
(a) the amount claimed or in dispute in the proceedings is more than
$10,000 but not more than $30,000 and the Tribunal has made
an order under
clause 10(2) of Schedule 4 to the Act in relation to the proceedings, or
(b) the amount claimed or in dispute in the proceedings is more than
r 38 of the NCAT Rules applies, then costs may be determined without reference
to the principles under ss 60(1)-(3) of the NCAT
Act. The Tribunal does not mix
r 38 of the NCAT Rules and ss 60(1)-(3) of the NCAT Act to discrete parts of the
proceedings.
when r 38 of the NCAT Act applies, the principle that costs follow the event is
the starting point. A helpful summary of the
principles (although in the context
of Clause 13 of Sch. 5D of the
Health Practitioner Regulation National Law
(NSW)) is set out in
Puri v Medical Council Of New South Wales (No
[2024] NSWCATOD 122
Vella v Mir (No 3)
[2020] NSWCATAP 17
, the Appeal Panel stated at
“ [28] Clause 38 gives the Tribunal a wide discretion to make an order for
costs. It does not specify the factors the Tribunal
must take into account in
exercising the discretion, although the discretion to make such an order must be
exercised judicially:
see, for example,
[2001] FCA 1865
[29] Where an application has been heard and determined on the merits and Clause
38 applies, the appropriate starting point for the
exercise of the discretion is
not that the parties are to pay their own costs. Rather, it is the
well-established position at common
law; that is, that the purpose of making a
costs order is to provide compensation to the party in whose favour the order is
for the expense the party has been put to in prosecuting or defending legal
proceedings. In general terms, this means that a party
who is successful is
entitled to an order for costs in its favour, subject to exceptions generally
involving misconduct on the part
of that party:

BNT Constructions Pty Ltd v Allen
[2017] NSWCATAP
the Appeal Panel, having set aside a costs order made in the Consumer
and Commercial Division, decided to re-exercise the costs discretion.
was the applicable costs provision in that case. At [67] the Appeal Panel noted
the following principles relevant to the
exercise of the discretion:
(1) the starting point is that a successful party should be entitled to an order
for costs in his favour;
(2) an award of costs is by way of an indemnity and not as punishment;
(3) there is no absolute rule that, absent disentitling conduct, a successful
party is to be compensated by the unsuccessful party;
(4) the factors to be considered are not to be confined as to do so would
constrain the general discretion;
(5) the relative success of the parties on different issues and the time taken
to determine them may be relevant;
(6) the nature of the proceedings is relevant;
(7) the proper exercise of the discretion requires a decision maker to do
justice between the parties and to exercise the discretion
having regard to
relevant considerations and in a manner which is not arbitrary and
capricious.”
successful party is entitled to its costs unless there is an appropriate reason
to depart from that principle (
Oshlack v Richmond River Council
[1998] HCA 11).
onus lies on the losing party to establish a basis for any departure from the
general rule:
Waterman v Gerling (Costs)
[2005] NSWSC
the discretionary power of a Court (or the Tribunal when r 38 of the NCAT Rules
applies) to determine the appropriate costs
order is wide and is to be liberally
construed in order to achieve justice in the particular case (
State of New
South Wales v Stanley
[2007] NSWCA 330
Elite Protective
Personnel Pty Ltd v Salmon (No 2)
[2007] NSWCA 373
Circumstances
where there is departure from the principle that the successful party is
entitled to be awarded its costs of the proceedings
(1) Unreasonable rejection of a
offer by the successful
(2) Mixed success on different issues by both parties such that a proportionate
costs order should be made (
Bostik Australia Pty Ltd v Liddiard

Monie v Commonwealth of
Australia (No 2)
[2008] NSWCA 15
Michael Hill Jeweller (Australia) Pty Ltd v Gispac Pty Ltd
[2024] NSWCA 274
); or an order that each party bear
its own costs (
Hogan v Trustee of the Roman Catholic Church
[2006] NSWSC 74
(3) Disentitling conduct by the successful party (
Tomanovic v Global Mortgage
Equity Corporation Pty Ltd (No 2)
[2011] NSWCA 256
Ritter v Godfrey
[1920] 2 KB 47).
An example of disentitling
conduct is where the successful party’s conduct caused unnecessary expense
Douglass v Lawton Pty Ltd (No 2)
[2007] NSWCA 90).
(4) The party achieves only very minor, or nominal, success in comparison to the
extent of claims made (

(5) An earlier interlocutory costs order against the successful party.
Was the Calderbank Offer Unreasonably Rejected?
principles are well established. A concise summary of those
principles was set out in
Harper v Harper (No 2)
[2025] NSWSC 360
“The failure by a party to accept an offer of compromise which is a
Calderbank offer where that party does not achieve a judgment
more favourable
than the offer is one of the circumstances in which the court may exercise its
discretion under r 42.1 of the UCPR
to make some order other than costs
following the event on the ordinary basis. However, merely because the party to
whom the offer
was made does not ultimately obtain a more favourable judgment
does not automatically lead to a favourable costs order, or raise
a presumption
that such an order should be made:
E Group Security
The onus is on the party making a Calderbank offer to satisfy the court that it
should exercise the costs discretion in its favour,
in particular that (a) the
Calderbank offer embodies a genuine compromise and (b) it was unreasonable for
the other party not to
accept it, which is an evaluative judgment to be made by
reference to the terms of the offer and all the relevant surrounding
circumstances
at the time that it was made, and not with the benefit of

[2011] NSWCA
, [11], [16];
Wheatley v Lakshmanan (No 2)
[2022] NSWSC 851
E Group Security
at [57]-[58]
Relevant factors in determining whether the rejection of an offer was
unreasonable include (a) the stage of the proceeding at which
the offer was
received; (b) the time allowed to the offeree to consider the offer; (c) the
extent of the compromise offered; (d)
the offeree’s prospects of success,
assessed at the date of the offer; (e) the clarity with which the terms of the
expressed; and (f) whether the offer foreshadowed an application for
indemnity costs in the event of the offeree rejecting it:
Hazeldene’s
Chicken Farm Pty Ltd v Victorian Workcover Authority (No 2)
(2005) 13 VR
[2005] VSCA 298
Group Security
at [59]. A finding of unreasonableness should not be made
other than on clear grounds:
E Group Security
In relation to (d), what is required is an objective assessment of the
offeree’s prospects of success as at the date of the
Hazeldene’s Chicken Farm
The practice of treating Calderbank offers in this way is informed by the public
policy objective of providing an incentive to the
parties to end their
litigation as soon as possible and discouraging wasteful and unreasonable
behaviour by litigants:
Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Gretton
. However, the mere fact that the offer is a reasonable one
does not make it unreasonable for the offeree to have rejected it:
at [74] and [120].”
this matter, the builder has failed to establish the owners unreasonably refused
to accept the offer of 17 July 2023 (when read
in conjunction with the letter of
23 June 2023) for the following reasons:
(1) The builder was not clearly offering to perform any work to rectify defects.
Rather, what the builder was offering to do was
to “investigate” and
then, only if the builder thought that there were major defects set out in the
report of Mr Xue
dated 16 April 2021, rectify those defects. The offer empowered
the builder to “determine the cause and extent” of any
defects. It
follows that if the builder did not believe it caused any major defects, it did
not have to rectify. That offer was vague,
uncertain and entirely dependent upon
the opinion of the builder.
(2) The offer was contingent upon the parties entering into a Deed at some
future time. However, no terms of the Deed were identified.
Again, the terms of
the offer were vague and uncertain.
(3) It cannot be said that had the offer been accepted, the owners would have
been in a better position (or no worse position) than
the work orders ultimately
made by the Tribunal. By the time the Tribunal determined the matter at a
contested hearing, the owners
had obtained a second and more comprehensive
report of Mr Xue, and the builder had obtained an expert report by Mr Roberts.
The Tribunal
found in favour of the owners on most of the defect issues and
accepted the proposed method of rectification by Mr Xue on most of
issues. That was clearly a much better outcome for the owners than accepting an
offer that the builder “investigate”
and only repair the defects set
out in Mr Xue’s first report that the builder thought were major defects,
as well as enter
into a Deed with unspecified terms.
Any Other Reason to Depart from the Principle that the Builder Pay the
Owners Costs?
is no basis established for making a proportional costs order, nor is there any
basis for making an order that each party bear
its own costs.
owners succeeded on most of the issues in dispute, and the builder failed on its
Allianz v Waterbrook
causation argument, which consumed a significant
amount of hearing time and submissions.
builder’s arguments that the owners unsuccessfully pressed
“non-major defects” is not reflected in the findings
of the Tribunal
in the substantive decision.
builder’s submission that the fact the owners obtained a work order under
s 48O of the HB Act rather than an award of damages
is a matter to be held
against the owners is rejected. The Tribunal dealt with this issue at paragraphs
[204]-[206] of the substantive
decision. The fact that the owners ultimately
only sought a work order, rather than pressing for an order for damages, does
not constitute
disentitling conduct in the circumstances of this matter.
a HB Act matter, it is open to the Tribunal to make remedial orders that include
ordering the builder to rectify defects; or make
an order for damages (s 48O of
the HB Act). Section 48MA of the HB Act states the ‘preferred
outcome’ is that the builder
be ordered to rectify, but that principle can
be departed from in appropriate circumstances. The fact that the owners
chose to press for a work order rather than argue the Tribunal should
depart from the ‘preferred outcome’ was not unusual
or unorthodox.
It does not, in the circumstances of this matter, constitute disentitling
conduct, such as the builder incurring unnecessary
or unreasonable costs to
defend an issue which was unsuccessful, or withdrawn, or not pressed. The
builder obtained expert evidence,
and that evidence included the method of
rectification for any defects.
one exception, the interlocutory history of the proceedings does not raise any
issue that causes the Tribunal to depart from
the principles that costs follow
the event, and the owners, as the successful party, are entitled to a costs
order in their favour.
one exception is the interlocutory costs order made by Rosser PM on 9 February
2024. In the substantive decision, the Tribunal
overlooked that costs order.
There is no basis to vary or set aside that interlocutory order. If no
interlocutory costs order is
made, the usual principle is that costs of the
interlocutory dispute are costs in the cause. However, in this matter there was
interlocutory costs order made. It is surprising that the owners’
Solicitor did not concede that there had been an interlocutory
costs order made
against the owners, and the final costs orders should take into account that
(1) A hearing on the issue of costs is dispensed with under
Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013
(2) Order 3 of the Tribunal dated 28 May 2025 is varied to read: “The
respondent is to pay the applicants’ costs of the
proceedings on the
ordinary basis as agreed or assessed, other than in respect of the costs order
made by the Tribunal on 9 February
(3) The Tribunal affirms the costs order made on 9 February 2024.
I hereby certify that this is a true and accurate record of the reasons for
decision of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal of New
