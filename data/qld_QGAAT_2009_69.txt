REASONS FOR DECISION
[1] DAE is 27 years old. She came to the attention of
the Tribunal when the Tribunal received an application from BP on 25 May 2009.
BP is an Acting Service Manager for Disability Services in the Department of
Communities. She applied to the Tribunal seeking the
appointment of DJ,
DAE’s mother, as guardian for restrictive practices and the appointment of
The Public Trustee of Queensland
as administrator for DAE.
[2] DAE lives in a duplex supported by Disability Services on a 24 hour-a-day
basis. She shares the duplex with another woman. DAE
receives community access
services 4 to 5 days a week varying in length from half days to full days. This
includes voluntary work
at Lifeline and other outings to the community.
DAE’s services in this regard are provided by Family Support Group
(FSGA). DAE has a good understanding of the spoken word.
[3] These Reasons relate to the application for the appointment of a guardian
for restrictive practices only.
[4] The application was heard in regional Queensland on 13 August 2009. Present
at the hearing was DAE, the adult, BP, applicant,
WF, team leader, VD,
residential care officer and DJ, DAE’s mother.
[5] The relevant legislation governing this application is
Section 80ZD
Guardianship and Administration Act 2000
(the Act). The relevant parts of
Section 80ZD
are shown below:
80ZD Appointment
(1) The tribunal may, by order, appoint a guardian for a restrictive
practice matter for an adult if the tribunal is satisfied—
(a) the adult has impaired capacity for the matter; and
(b) the adult’s behaviour has previously resulted in harm to the
adult or others; and
(c) there is a need for a decision about the matter; and
(d) without the appointment—
(i) the adult’s behaviour is likely to cause harm to the adult or
others; and
(ii) the adult’s interests will not be adequately protected.
(2) The appointment may be on terms considered appropriate by the
(3) The appointment has effect for the period stated in the order.
(4) The period for which the appointment has effect must not be more than
12 months from the day the order is made
[6] The first question that the Tribunal has to address is whether DAE has
impaired capacity for the matter, which in this instance,
is about the use of
chemical restraint as a restrictive practice.
[7] Capacity is defined in Schedule 4 of the Act:
, for a person for a
matter, means the person is capable of-
(a) understanding the nature and effect of decisions about the matter;
(b) freely and voluntarily making decisions about the matter; and
(c) communicating the decisions in some way.
DOES DAE HAVE IMPAIRED CAPACITY FOR DECISION-MAKING?
[8] The health professional report from Dr C dated 21 May 2009 indicated that
DAE has a severe intellectual disability and is unable
to make any simple or
complex decisions in any area of her life. All parties present agreed that DAE
would not have the capacity
to make decisions about the use of medication to
control her behaviour. The Tribunal concluded that DAE did not have capacity for
decisions about restrictive practices.
HAS DAE’S BEHAVIOUR PREVIOUSLY RESULTED IN HARM TO
HERSELF OR OTHERS?
[9] The Tribunal heard evidence from Disability Services staff that DAE’s
behaviours include harm to herself and others from
biting herself, hitting of
others and head banging. The Tribunal was satisfied that DAE’s behaviour
has caused harm to herself
and others. The Tribunal also received in written
evidence a report from Disability Services entitled Comprehensive Functional
and Support Plans which included information outlining DAE’s
behaviour and the procedures to be used by staff to reduce the
above behaviours
and to record such behaviours. After considering the definition of harm in
Section 123E
Disability Services Act 2006
123E Definitions
In this part—
to a person means—
(a) physical harm to the person; or
(b) a serious risk of physical harm to the person; or
(c) damage to property involving a serious risk of physical harm to the
[10] The Tribunal concluded that DAE’s behaviour has previously resulted
in harm to herself or others.
IS THERE A NEED FOR A DECISION ABOUT THE MATTER?
[11] The application seeks the appointment of a guardian to make decisions about
the use of chemical restraint to control DAE’s
behaviours which cause harm
to herself or others. Chemical restraint is defined in
section 123F
Disability Services Act 2006
123F Meaning of chemical restraint
Chemical restraint
, of an adult with an intellectual or
cognitive disability, means the use of medication for the primary purpose of
controlling the
adult’s behaviour.
(2) However, using medication for the proper treatment of a diagnosed
mental illness or physical condition is not chemical restraint.
(3) To remove any doubt, it is declared that an intellectual or cognitive
disability is not a physical condition.
(4) In this section—
, for a mental illness or physical condition, means
a doctor confirms the adult has the illness or condition.
mental illness
Mental Health Act 2000
[12] The medication, for which the approval of a guardian is to be sought, is
Tegretol liquid. The Tribunal was advised that DAE
has had medication for
epilepsy since she was 11 years old. She has always taken Tegretol to control
her petit mal and grand mal
seizures. She currently receives 20mls twice daily.
Her previous dose was 15mls. There was a reported increase in her challenging
behaviours which appears to have been ameliorated to some extent when the dose
was increased to 20mls. It is on this basis that the
application has been
[13] The Tribunal considered that the use of Tegretol was for the proper
treatment of a physical condition, namely epilepsy and that
its primary purpose
was for the treatment of epilepsy. The use of the medication was therefore not
for the primary purpose of controlling
DAE’s behaviour.
[14] The Tribunal considers that the increase in Tegretol does not constitute
chemical restraint in accordance with the definition
of chemical restraint in
Disability Services Act 2006
As a result, the Tribunal does not
consider there is a need for a decision about the matter because no chemical
restraint is being
used. DAE’s mother, DJ, can give consent to medication
if required as a statutory health attorney when the medication is being
the proper treatment of a physical condition.
[15] The Tribunal therefore dismissed the application for the appointment of a
MATTER OF CONCERN
[16] The Tribunal as indicated earlier received a health professional report
from Dr C. This report has been partly prepared by Dr
C and partly prepared by
Disability Services staff and provided to Dr C to sign. In the light of the
serious matters being considered
by the Tribunal, the Tribunal considers this
practice is flawed and advised the parties at the hearing that this is
unacceptable.
[17] The health professional report must be completed by the person who signs
it. Disability Services might also look at revising
the form headed
“Clarification of Purpose of Medication (PRN or fixed dose)”.
Someone, presumably Dr C has ticked the
two available boxes. That is, the reason
for the medication being for the proper use of a diagnosed mental or physical
as well as the box indicating that the primary purpose is for
controlling the person’s behaviour. Dr C ticked both boxes and
plus sign between the two, presumably indicating that the medication was used
for both purposes. It would be helpful to
the Tribunal if this form was revised
indicating to the doctor that only one of these boxes was to be ticked.
[18] This has been brought into sharper focus because, in the health
professional report in response to a question, “Which
if any of these
medications are used primarily to control the adult’s behaviour as opposed
to treating a diagnosed mental illness
or physical condition”, the answer
provided was “Nil’.
[19] These inconsistencies are unhelpful and difficult to reconcile when the
Tribunal is uncertain about who has filled the forms
