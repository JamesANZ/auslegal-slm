2008 VPrivCmr 3
Complainant AK v Statutory Authority
– Information Privacy Principle (IPP) 1.3 –
allegation that the Statutory Authority (the Authority) failed to notify
the Complainant’s personal information would be available on the world
wide web (www).
Use and Disclosure
– IPP 2.1 – allegation that the
disclosure of the Complainant’s personal information on the Statutory
Authority’s
website was not in accordance with the primary purpose of
collection or a related secondary purpose that would reasonably be
________________________________________________________________________
The Complaint
In 2007, the Complainant sent the Authority a
submission in regards to a proposed alteration to one of the Authority’s
systems. When submitting the response, the Complainant was made aware
via notices on the Authority’s website, that having
made a submission, the
Complainant’s name and locality would become available to view on the
Authority’s website. The
Complainant states that the notice did not state
that the information would also therefore be available on the world wide web
In mid 2008, the Complainant “self-googled”, as most people do
from to time to time. A search listing was returned naming
the Complainant, the
Complainant’s suburb and a link to the Authority’s website. The
Complainant stated that because
the Complainant’s personal information
appeared on internet search engines, it appeared outside the Authority’s
and this was not sufficiently articulated by the notice.
The Complainant wrote to the Authority who then arranged to have the
Complainant’s details removed from Google and the Authority’s
website. The Authority advised the Complainant that:
“Any information that is added to any website can be picked up by
the organisation
publishing that information on its website, but is an automatic process. It is
generally understood that publishing
information to the internet places that
information in the public domain, where it can be picked up by search
The Complainant believed that the Authority failed to fully
inform how the Complainant’s personal information contained in the
submission would be disclosed, in that it would be made available on the world
wide web (www), therefore constituting a breach of
The Complainant also believed that by publishing the
Complainant’s name and suburb on the Authority’s website, given that
the website is publicly accessible and available on the world wide web, the
Authority disclosed the Complainant’s personal
information. The
Complainant believed the disclosure was unauthorised because it was unrelated to
the primary purpose of collection
and was not a secondary purpose the
Complainant would reasonably expect, therefore breaching IPP 2.1.
Response to Complaint
The Authority stated that it believed its
policies and processes complied with the IPPs. Submitters are informed that
their names
and locality will appear on the Authority’s website and the
Complainant had been informed of this when invited to forward a
submission.
Consequently, the Authority stated that it provided the Complainant with
appropriate and adequate notice under IPP 1.3
and disclosed the
Complainant’s personal information for a purpose that should have been
reasonably expected by the Complainant
under IPP 2.1.
The Authority also believed that it was common knowledge that information
placed on a website could be located through search engines
such as Google.
Furthermore, a significant amount of information would need to be provided if
they were expected to convey everything
that can happen to information once it
is placed on a website.
IPP 1.3 requires organisations to take reasonable steps to
notify individuals about how their personal information will be used and
disclosed. The Privacy Commissioner considered that the notice provided in its
Guide for Submissions and published on the Authority’s
website constituted
reasonable steps to notify individuals about how their information would be used
and disclosed.
IPP 2.1 requires that an organisation only use and disclose personal
information in accordance with the primary purpose of collection
related secondary purpose that could be reasonably expected. It was considered
that the majority of individuals would understand
that disclosing their personal
information on a publicly accessible website would mean that the information
would be able to be accessed
via the world wide web. The Privacy Commissioner
considered that the Complainant’s personal information was disclosed in
with the purpose for which it was collected.
For these reasons, the Privacy Commissioner believed there was adequate
notice stating how the Complainant’s personal information
was going to be
used and disclosed under IPP 1.3. Consequently, as a result of the notice
provided, the Privacy Commissioner considered
the disclosure was in accordance
with the primary purpose of collection or for a reasonably expected secondary
purpose under IPP
The Privacy Commissioner declined to entertain the complaint under section
29(1)(a) of the Act on the grounds that there was not an
interference with the
Complainant’s privacy. The Complainant did not request to have the matter
referred to the Victorian
Civil and Administrative Tribunal.
