Obtaining client�s consent to collect personal information [2006] NSWPrivCmr 5 (1 July 2006)
Obtaining client’s consent to collect personal information
We had received a number of inquiries from Department of Housing tenants in
relation to the Department’s Application for Rental
Subsidy and Rental
Subsidy Renewal Certificate forms. The forms had to be completed by those
seeking to apply or renew eligibility
for the rental subsidy, which the
Department provides to low income tenants. Both forms request tenants’ and
other household
members’ financial and other information and also
requested consent to the Department verifying the information provided with
third parties. Some tenants found it confusing that what they considered to be
two different matters i.e. (a) a declaration that
the information provided is
true and correct and (b) consent for verification of this information, were
required to be verified by
only one signature.
We assessed the forms and agreed, that tenants should have the option of
making an application to renew their rental subsidy without
at the same time
consenting to the Department verifying the information from third parties. We
then wrote to the Department inviting
their representatives to a meeting about
the issue and to discuss whether the forms might not be able to be
redesigned.
In our opinion the best way to address the complainants’ concerns was
to redesign both forms so that tenants can provide 2 signatures:
one to declare
the accuracy of the information provided and another one to consent to that
information being verified by the Department
with third parties. Although we
pointed out to the complainants that withholding their consent may result in
their rental subsidy
not being granted, many of our enquirers would prefer to
have the choice of giving or withholding their consent (without that choice
consent is not genuine). The meeting with the Department of Housing
representatives was very productive. We had a look at the forms,
explained to
them best privacy practice in relation to consent and discussed the
enquiriers’ concerns. Our suggestions in relation
to redesign of the forms
were accepted by the Department and some time later we were provided by the
Department with new forms that
incorporated our suggestions in relation to the
consent issue. We were also invited to make some suggestions as to wording and
The Department agreed to incorporate our suggestions in the next
reprint of the forms.
