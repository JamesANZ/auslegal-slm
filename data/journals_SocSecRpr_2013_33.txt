Austudy: waiver of debt arising solely from administrative error
Decided: 8th October 2013
F was unemployed and receiving newstart allowance. His employment services
provider suggested he study through NSW TAFE’s Open
Training and Education
Network (OTEN), which is a form of online distance education. His provider
IV course and claim Austudy. F continued to
study throughout this period, but struggled in this course, and in the
subsequent similar
course he enrolled in for 2013, due to mental health
problems. In the end he only completed one unit of his course.
Centrelink granted him Austudy from 25 February 2012 and paid him until 8 May
2013, when it decided that he was not qualified to receive
the payment and, in
fact, had never been qualified to receive the payment. It raised a debt of
$18,021.09. An authorised review officer
decided that the debt was correct and
should be recovered and F applied to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT)
for review.
The legal framework and issues
To qualify for Austudy, a person must meet an activity test
Social Security Act 1991
(Cth) (the Act)). A person who is a full-time student
can meet this test by being enrolled in an approved course of education
of the Act). A person is a full-time student if they undertake at least
75% of the normal full-time student load in the relevant
study period, which
might be in practice a year, a term or a semester
of the Act).
Applying these rules to different forms of study can be difficult.
Departmental policy in the Guide to Social Security Law provides
guidance in
some cases (especially at section 3.3.4.60). Applying these rules to study
through OTEN is especially difficult. Students
are generally enrolled for 12
months at OTEN, do not have to attend classes or other face to face contact and
can complete assignments
and modules of a course at any time throughout the year. So it is hard, for
example, to assess how much study is being undertaken.
Despite this, there is no
guidance in Departmental policy.
The problem of applying these rules to OTEN students was considered by the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) in Willmer and Secretary,
Department of
Education, Employment and Workplace Relations
[2009] AATA 22 (Willmer).
Willmer the AAT’s solution to the problem was to make progress a measure
of full-time status. This is very different from
the ordinary approach to
full-time status for face-to-face learning, where a person will be generally
treated as full-time so long
as they remained enrolled at the required level.
In effect, the AAT decided that full-time status and qualification for
Austudy was a matter of enrolment in a sufficient number of
satisfactory completion of the minimum hours required. This has a troubling
consequence unique to OTEN, which is that a
student may be found retrospectively
not to have been qualified for the payment if they do not make satisfactory
progress by completing
a sufficient number of modules by the end of the 12 month
study period. The debt could arise even if they have continued to study
changed their enrolment, the main circumstances they are obliged to notify
Centrelink of if they change. As the SSAT commented
in this case, this is
unsatisfactory as ‘[a] person whose payment was properly granted and who
as complied with the requirements,
should not have a debt because of facts that
come into existence only when the debt is raised’.
The SSAT decision
The SSAT found that the Certificate IV course in which F was enrolled in 2012
had been assigned 405 ‘nominal hours’ by
OTEN; that is, OTEN
classified it as the equivalent of 405 hours of class time if it were a
face-to-face course.
In NSW the normal full time student load for TAFE is 16 hours per week, so
that the requirement to undertake 75% of this load to qualify
for Austudy
that 12 hours per week of study must be undertaken.
The SSAT reasoned that, as OTEN enrolled students for 52 weeks (there being
no semesters or vacations), the nominal weekly hours for
the course F enrolled
in 2012 were 405 ÷ 52 = 7.78 hours per week. This meant that even if F had
completed all his subjects
he would never have reached the required minimum of
12 hours per week.
As he was never a full-time student, F had been overpaid and had a debt
Social Security Act
). However, it was decided he should never
have been granted Austudy on the information provided to Centrelink, that he had
the payment in good faith and met his obligations (as his enrolment had
never changed and he continued to study throughout the period),
and the debt was
not raised within 6 weeks. The SSAT therefore decided that it must be waived
Social Security Act
, as it had arisen solely because of
Centrelink administrative error. The SSAT emphasised that, given the complexity
of this issue,
F had no way of knowing how his qualification might be
determined.
Formal decision
The SSAT decided that F was not a full-time student, was not qualified for
Austudy, but that the resulting debt should be waived in
