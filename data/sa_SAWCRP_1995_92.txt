Catchwords:
Costs reasonably incurred —

used (yet) in legal
proceedings, but used by employer in assessing lump sum
compensation award — decision set aside and accounts to be paid with
exception of x-rays relating to non-compensable condition.

Workers’ Compensation Review
HADJIARGIRIS AND PASMINCO METALS
(06849789/01/02)
Ex Tempore Decision made by Review
Officer on 12th January 1995
(Hearings 12th January 1995)
Review Officer FitzGerald
This is the written determination requested by the employer for an ex
tempore decision made on 12th January 1995.
An application for review pursuant to the
Worker's Rehabilitation and
Compensation Act, 1986
, (the Act) was made by John Hadjiargiris on 31th August
1994 in relation to a decision by the employer Pasminco Metals BHAS which
decided on 10th August 1994 not to pay for the reports provided by Doctors Moss
and Russell and for x-rays performed by Perrett and
Partners. These accounts
amounted to $1773.00.
The worker appeared and was represented by Mr Trevor Girdham of the AWU.
The employer Pasminco Metal BHAS which I find to be an exempt
employer under the
Act was represented by Mr David Langston, Senior Claims Officer of the
I have before me the decision of the employer date 6th June 1994, in
which they said
"We acknowledge receipt of you compensation claim date 3rd January 1992 and
previous correspondence and communication between your
solicitor of 3rd February
1994, 23rd May 1994 and 30th may 1994 and those representing ourselves
particularly of 14th April 1994
and 27th May 1994 wherein you are seeking
compensation for a strain to the left groin area, lumbar spine and an
aggravation of Perthes
disease pursuant to
Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1986
and whereas we have considered the
following opinions in respect of your claim namely the reports of Mr H I Moss of
1st December
1993 and 22nd April 1994 and Mr Albert W Russell of 21st February
1994 together with your request for a commutation
AND FURTHERMORE WHEREAS
we have accepted the claims for a compensable disability pursuant to the
abovementioned Act for the abovementioned injuries which
occurred on the 31st
December 1991 and on various other occasions we determine that you are not
entitled pursuant to the provision
of the abovementioned Act tp an assessment
pursuant to
Section 43."
The letter goes on to detail
entitlements and
then states
"It has been agreed between your solicitors and those representing
ourselves that a lump sum assessed in accordance with the legal principles
and your continuing partial incapacity amount to $8,000.
Pasminco Metals - BHAS Pty Ltd has determined pursuant to the provision of
Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, 1986
accept your claim as being due to your employment, your condition is permanent
and your request pursuant to
to pay you an amount of
THOUSAND DOLLARS
($8,000) inclusive of representation costs and
disbursements pursuant to
of the said Act.
Pasminco Metals - BHAS Pty Ltd further determines that you have no further
claim against if for the injuries which are the subject
matter of this
determination which is essence giving effect to the agreement reach by our
respective solicitors and includes your
withdrawal of your
application pursuant to the Industrial Relation Act (SA) without any order as to
Following that determination Mr Hadjiargiris lodged a claim for repayment
of the account of Dr Moss for $540.00 and Dr Russell for
$443.00 and Perrett and
Partners x-ray account of $790.00.
In the letter of 10th August 1994 the employer states
"We acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 20th July 1994, requesting us to
pay to you or on your behalf charges by Mr HIM Moss,
Mr AV Russell and Perrett
and Partners. All of these costs were generated by your solicitors and not in
connection with the treatment
of your medical condition. Therefore ,we can
only regard them as disbursements.
The agreement which was reached between our respective solicitors to pay you
the sum of $5,000 clearly stated that the amount included
representation costs
and disbursements."
In a later letter dated 29th August 1994 the employer stated
"We believe the $8,000 paid to you was pursuant to
Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, 1986
, and included any representation costs
and disbursement.
We apologise for the error in our earlier letter. The lump sum was $8,000
not $5,000."
The issue then is what is the nature of the services provided by Doctors
Moss, Russell and the x-rays taken by Perrett and Partners.
I note the letter from the employer's solicitor, Lawson Downs dated 14th
April 1994 to the workers then solicitors Paul, Kirk, Roberts
and Company
"We have read Mr Russell's report with some interest.
As you are probably aware the only claim your client has against our client
for compensation under the Act is a strain to the groin
superimposed upon his
pre-existing Perthes disease.
Consequently, the matters that Mr Russell canvassed to a large degree have
nothing to do with the compensation claim except, without
prejudice, the 10%
alleged disability for a left inguinal strain.
We have taken this into account simply because it is a disability located in
the region upon which you client complained.
Our client is most mindful that there are two outstanding matters between it
and your client.
Taking all thing into consideration, our client is prepared to offer to
settle the claims, the sum of $8,000 inclusive of costs.
That sum of money is to provide full and final resolution subject to
of your clients's claim against our client pursuant to the
Rehabilitation and Compensation Act
and also to finalise and dispense this claim
under Section 31 of the Industrial Relations Act."
From examining the report from the doctors, I find Dr Russell ordered the
x-rays on 31st January 1994 and that these do not involve
the disability. I
find however, that the reports from Dr Moss dated 1st December 1993 and 22nd
April 1994, were requested to resolve
the Section 43 claim which was lodged in
May 1993, according to my notes.
I note that the Section 43 claim was refused by the company and is not
subject to an application for review. However, in order to
make the decision to
refuse the Section 43 claim the company did consider and use the opinion of Dr
Moss detailed in his reports
of 1st December 1993 and 22nd April 1994. Indeed
Dr Moss' report of 22nd April, 1994 is addressed to the employer's solicitors.
I find that the company would not have been able to properly make their decision
of 6th June 1994, unless they had had available
to them the reports of Dr Moss
and indeed in their decision of 6th June 1994 they referred to them.
I note in their decision of the 6th June 1994 that the employer paid an
amount of "$8,000 inclusive of representation costs and disbursements
to Section 42 of the said Act", but the reports of Dr Moss were used to
determine to refuse the Section 43 claim and as
such have not been included as
disbursements pursuant to Section 42 of the Act.
I find therefore that the account of $540.00 for Dr Moss is a
disbursement arising from the decision of the company on 6th June 1994
grant a lump sum pursuant to Section 43 of the Act.
Dr Russell's report includes his opinion that the worker is still
partially incapacitated from work injuries, whereas Dr Moss believed
no incapacity arising from the work injury. I find that the decision to pay a
lump sum pursuant to Section 42 is based
on Dr Russell's opinion. His report is
then properly a disbursement already covered in the $8,000 payment.
I find that the X-rays were for another non-compensable condition and for
this reason X-ray costs are not the liability of the employer.
DETERMINATION
Accordingly, pursuant to Section 96 of the Act I set aside the decision
of the employer dated 10th August 1994 and substitute for
that my fresh
determination that the accounts for payments for Dr Moss' reports of 1st
December, 1993 and 22nd April, 1994 are disbursements
in relation to a Section
43 decision made on 6th June 1994 and have not been included in the
disbursements pursuant to Section 42
of the Act. Accounts for X-rays taken by
Perrett and Partners are not the liability of the employer as they relate to a
non-compensable
condition. Dr Russell's report of 21st February, 1994 is a
disbursement relating to the Section 42 decision which has already been
The worker was represented by a member of a registered association and is
entitled to costs and disbursements relevant to this application
for review.
Any appeal against this determination must be lodged with the Workers'
Compensation Appeal Tribunal within one month of the receipt
determination. Enquires about appeals may be directed to the Registrar of the
Tribunal, Riverside Centre, North Terrace,
Adelaide (Phone: 207 0960), and forms
for appeal are available from the same address.
