Merits review at the federal level
Merits review at the federal level
In the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Australia is fortunate to have had the
benefit of a long‑established independent external
merits review tribunal
of no small stature in the federal scheme of things. It was established by the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975
(Cth) and was part of what is
styled the administrative law ‘package’ designed and proposed in a
number of Commonwealth
reports in the early
Few administrative law lawyers would have imagined that, about 30 years after
the AAT’s establishment, the High Court of Australia
would be deliberating
on fundamental aspects of the AAT’s nature and the scope of its
in the AAT was discussed at length by
the court in
Shi v Migration Agents Registration
[140]–[141], Kiefel J stated (with Crennan J agreeing (at [117])):
The term ‘merits review’ does not appear in the AAT Act, although it
is often used to explain that the function of the
Tribunal extends beyond a
review for legal error, to a consideration of the facts and circumstances
relevant to the decision. The
object of the review undertaken by the Tribunal
has been said to be to determine what is the ‘correct or preferable
‘Preferable’ is apt to refer to a decision which
involves discretionary considerations. A ‘correct’ decision,
context of review, might be taken to be one rightly made, in the proper sense.
It is, inevitably, a decision by the original
decision-maker with which the
Tribunal agrees. Smithers J, in
Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor
Automotive Pty Ltd
[1979] FCA 21
((1979) 24 ALR 307
at 335), said that it is for the
Tribunal to determine whether the decision is acceptable, when tested against
the requirements of
good government. This is because the Tribunal, in essence,
is an instrument of government administration …
The reasons of the members of the Full Court of the Federal Court in
Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs
((1979) 24 ALR 577)
confirm what
is apparent from s 43(1), that the Tribunal reaches its conclusion, as to what
is the correct decision, by conducting
its own, independent, assessment and
determination of the matters necessary to be addressed
((1979) 24 ALR 577

Immigration and Ethnic Affairs

case Hayne and Heydon JJ described the
nature of the AAT’s ‘task’ in some detail (at [96] to [100]).
Further, Kirby
P discussed at length the nature of the AAT (at [30] to [32]),
its function (at [33] to [38]) and the purpose of the AAT Act (at
[39] to [42]).
Although the case arose in the context of the disciplinary provisions for the
control of registered migration agents
Migration Act 1958
(Cth), these fundamental matters assumed primary significance.
The court held that, when the AAT was reviewing the finding of the migration
agent’s regulatory authority that the migration
agent was not a fit and
proper person to be registered and was not a person of integrity, this did not
involve a temporal element,
as the Federal Court had held it did by majority in
Shi v Migration Agents Registration
The court held that
the tribunal, in reviewing this decision, was not restricted to a consideration
of the events occurring until
the time the authority made its decision but could
consider later events. It held that the tribunal could have regard to the state
of affairs at the time of making its decision unless in the legislation
empowering the decision maker to make the original decision
under review there
is a statutory qualification that the making of the decision should be
restricted to the material before the original
decision maker. It held that
there was no such statutory qualification in the
Migration Act
and therefore the
tribunal’s review was relevantly unrestricted (as to temporal
considerations).
The court also considered the AAT’s power to fix
‘conditions’ in the determination of the review. The tribunal had
determined that the migration agent should be cautioned but that the caution
should be lifted at a specified time if specific conditions
satisfied—namely, that he be supervised as a migration agent for three
years and that he not provide immigration assistance
in relation to applicants
for a protection visa during that period. The registration authority possessed
statutory power to ‘set
one or more conditions for the lifting of a
Migration Act
). The High Court determined (by
majority) that this power to impose conditions was wide enough to enable the AAT
to fashion, or ‘mould’,
conditions to the particular circumstances
of the case. The court did not comment on the appropriateness of the conditions
case, only on their legality—with the exception of Kirby J, who
stated (at [70]) that the tribunal had made an ‘available
and arguable
sensible disciplinary decision’.
The court also took the opportunity to endorse aspects of ‘long
established’ determinations as to the nature and scope
tribunal’s task in external merits review in cases such as
Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs
Re Brian Lawlor Automotive
Pty Ltd and Collector of Customs (New South Wales)
Minister for
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v
It is interesting to observe in the
case that the High Court
accepted the AAT’s significant review role and its evident important place
in the federal executive
scheme of independent merits review and construed its
powers widely in that broader context.
case has itself raised a number of questions left unanswered
by the High Court and that would benefit from investigation or review
Administrative Review Council. For example, the nature or function of the AAT as
an ‘investigative’ body or as
an ‘adversarial’ body is
not explored. Nor is the manner by which the agency or executive decision maker
is to defend
the decision in the tribunal or to assist the tribunal is settled.
That is so particularly having regard to the recently inserted
the AAT Act, which obliges the person who made the decision to use their best
endeavours to help the tribunal make its decision.
What does this mean in
practical terms? Do the model litigant rules apply?
More fundamentally, given the High Court’s firm confirmation of the
‘standing in the shoes’ merits review dogma,
what role or
significance remains for the primary decision or the decision under review (a
question raised but not wholly answered
by Kirby J in
at [34] and
[37]’? Is the primary decision merely relegated to the status of a
material now before the tribunal
(as Kirby J holds it is in
at [37])? Does it have significance in
fixing or narrowing the matters before the tribunal (as the delegate’s
decision limited
the Refugee Review Tribunal in
SZBEL v Minister for
Immigration
)? What scope is
there in the tribunal for raising fresh matters or for ‘ambush’
between the parties at tribunal
What does it mean for the tribunal to ‘review’ the original
decision, as the enabling Act requires and as is provided
for in section 25(4)
of the AAT Act? In
at [43] Kirby J suggests that it merely
‘makes it necessary in each case to identify the precise nature and
incidents of the
decision that is the subject of the review’.
These questions are all the more apposite when the decision maker or the
responsible agency, or both, possesses considerable specialist
corporate history, and experience and
Who is best equipped to
deal with such difficult and complex questions and in what manner? These
questions lead to further difficult
questions about, for example, the best way
to provide to the AAT proper resources and expertise in these cases.
Should all matters continue to be dealt with in the same fashion by the
tribunal? Should matters concerning safety, such as the regulation
transport industry, be dealt with separately or differently? The Administrative
Review Council’s investigation,
and perhaps resolution, of some of these
matters would be better than waiting for the High Court to focus on them in
another 30 years’
