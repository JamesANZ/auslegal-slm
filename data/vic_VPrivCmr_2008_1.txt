____________________________________________________________________
The Complainants were engaged in a protracted dispute with their neighbour.
As part of the dispute, the Complainants wrote regular
letters to the Local
Council over a two year period, requesting that Council take certain action in
regards to the neighbour.
The letters the Complainants wrote to Council contained detailed information

as part of Council Briefings.
The majority of letters written by the Complainants to Council
contained requests that the information contained in them be kept in
strictest confidence.
Unbeknownst to the Complainants, the neighbour with whom they were in dispute
made a Freedom of Information (FOI) application to the
Council. Council then
released documents containing the above mentioned information to that
The Complainants only became aware of this release on advice from a third
party. The Council later contacted the Complainants confirming
that documents
had been released to the neighbour under FOI.
The Complainants raised the issue of this release with Ombudsman Victoria.
Although Ombudsman Victoria considered the matter, the
FOI Act did not provide
the Complainants with any remedy for the release of information by the Council.
As the Ombudsman Victoria
considered that the FOI matter might raise unresolved

Section 33(1) of the FOI Act states that documents are exempt from disclosure
if this would amount to an unreasonable disclosure of
a person’s personal
Section 33(3) provides that where a request is made for a document which
contains information relating to the personal affairs of
any person who is not
the applicant and it is decided that access should be granted, if practicable,
the person who is the subject
of that information should be notified of the
decision and of their right to appeal to VCAT against that decision.
Although the Complainants’ neighbour made an FOI application and many
of the documents released to the neighbour were stamped
as having been
‘released under FOI’, the Complainants had not been contacted about
the application in compliance with
section 33(3), nor was there any indication
that Council had ‘turned its mind’ to the exemptions in the FOI Act
releasing the documents. By disregarding the FOI Act, the Privacy
Commissioner found that Council had not treated the disclosure
as an FOI matter;
rather, it released the documents similarly to any other release of
information.
documents contained “personal information” and the Council was
deemed to be an “organisation” under
section 9(1)(d) of the
Information Privacy Act
, the Privacy Commissioner’s jurisdiction was
therefore enlivened. The complaint involved an alleged breach of Information
Copies of documents released by Council to the neighbour were viewed by

Ombudsman Act 1973
allows the Ombudsman to communicate any
information it obtains to the Privacy Commissioner, provided that it is relevant
to the performance
of the Privacy Commissioner’s functions or duties).
As a part of its investigation, Privacy Victoria determined that
approximately 223 pages of documents were released by Council to
the neighbour
under FOI. Of these, around 185 pages were correspondence between the
Complainants and the Council, raising issues
Information Privacy
In light of the volume, nature and seriousness of the personal information
that was disclosed, in the Privacy Commissioner’s
view, the release did
not appear to be authorised under IPP 2.1. Based on this, coupled with the
Council’s failure to attempt
to address the complaint, the Privacy
Commissioner decided that it was not appropriate to decline the complaint under
Information Privacy Act
. The complaint was therefore
referred to conciliation.
The complaint was successfully conciliated. Council provided the
Complainants with compensation, a formal apology, and an undertaking
of its policies and conduct internal training.
