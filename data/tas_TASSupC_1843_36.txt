Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land

Cornwall Chronicle
(supplement), 14 October 1843
The Queen v Charles Reed. - This was an information preferred against the defendant for a nuisance, in having blocked
up a certain road leading to Fenton's Ford, in the district of Norfolk Plains. In the Attorney-General's address to the jury,
he stated that the road in question had always been open to the public, and that the defendant had obstructed it by cutting ditches
across it. The road in question, it would be proved, had been open to the public since the year 1814, and the defendant had on one
occasion subscribed with other persons towards its repair; that the defendant became possessed of a punt which worked across the
river, and then obstructed the road for a period of three months.
J.C. Carr. - I am a shopkeeper; I know the premises in and about Fenton's Ford; I have known the road pointed out
in the plan (now produced) leading across the Ford and leading from Longford about ten years; that road has undergone some alteration;
the alterations were made under the superintendence of Mr. James Hortle, district constable; the alterations were made four or five
years ago; the expenses were defrayed by public subscription. The public were in the habit of passing along that road before the
alteration took place; since the alteration the public have been in the habit of passing; I know of an obstruction being placed on
that road; there was three ditches cut. (The witness described where the ditches were cut on the chart.) One of the ditches was cut
the whole width of the road. The second obstruction appeared to be from taking up a bridge from the quantity of water on the place.
The third obstruction was close down to the river; Mr. Reed has property in that neighbourhood; there was a punt when I first came
into the district; I believe the property of Mr. Brumby. At the time the obstructions were made, the punt was the property of Mr.
Reed. It was possible for a horseman to pass the obstruction, but not a carriage. Mr. Reed subscribed very liberally towards repairing
the road on the Launceston side of Fenton's Ford; that is, the continuation of the road leading from the other side. I know Mr.
Scott, the surveyor; I pointed out the obstruction to him.
Cross-examined by Mr. Macdowell. - The last obstruction or ditch next the river was full of water; the river was not very
high at the time; there was no danger in passing the Ford at that time; I saw a party cross; I did not observe how deep it was; the
ditches were afterwards filled up; I think with gravel; I was not present at the time; I did not see them filled up; the order to
fill the ditches was given by several persons; I did not hear the order given; did not give any orders myself about filling them
up; I was appointed one of a public committee that advised the filling up; I paid Â£10 for having them filled up, out
of the money that had been subscribed; I saw part of one of Mr. Reed's fences cut down; I assisted in cutting it down myself.
The ditches remained about three weeks, according to my recollection; when the ditches were dug, I do not think the river was fordable;
I know that life has been lost in attempting to cross the Ford when the river was not fordable. The road leads through Mr. Reed's
land on the Longford side were the obstructions were; I believe the land on the other side belongs to a person of the name of Badcock;
it leads to the main road to Launceston; the road where the obstructions were, led to the road to Launceston.
James Davey. - I reside at Norfolk Plains, near Longford; I have resided there 28 years; I know Fenton's Ford. (The
Act of Council was here referred to by His Honor, where it states that no road shall be deemed a public road unless advertised in
the Gazette as main and cross roads, or which are now used at public roads.) I have known Fenton's Ford the last 28 years; the
road leading from the Longford road through Fenton's Ford has been in use 28 years; the land was originally granted to George
Eggleston; I believe he sold it to Fenton. The Ford is on the farm in possession of Mr. Reed; it was a road before Mr. Reed had possession
of it. The public have used that road continually; carriages, horses and carts have passed on the road ever since it has been a Ford.
There has been no other road of late years; I assisted in repairing the road; I was employed by Mr. Reed. I contributed towards the
repairs of the road myself; the road ran then where it does now; the line of road has never been altered to my knowledge; the road
was repaired three or four years ago; it was then made a good road; the public used that road 24 years ago; I do not know of any
other road leading from Longford to Launceston except the one over the bridge; there was fences on each side of the road; I think
they were put up by Mr. Reed's orders; the road was obstructed about a twelve-month ago; one obstruction was close to the Ford
- a ditch full of water; there was two other obstructions - ditches cut across the road; I should say six feet deep. People used
to get their water from the Ford, but could not do so when the obstructions existed. The inhabitants always used that road in summer
time. There has been drunken persons lost, and sober ones too at the Ford.
Cross-examined. - I have known the Ford for 28 years, but do not think that number of people have been drowned there.
William Mason. - I reside at Longford; I know Fenton's Ford; I have known the road leading from Longford to Fenton's
Ford for 22 years; the road runs through property formerly in my possession; it was used as a public road; I sold my interest in
that property to Mr. Reed; Mr. Reed's carts used to pass along that road previous to my selling it; there was no other road but
Cross-examined. - I have heard talk about some obstructions; I recollect having some conversation with Mr. Reed before
the obstructions were made, that it would be necessary to shut up that road; I think the obstructions remained three weeks or a month;
I think the Ford was dangerous when the obstructions were first placed; the Ford was safe for a week before I saw them filling up.
Mr. Macdowell admitted that the obstructions were caused by the defendant.
Mr. James Scott, surveyor, was called to prove the repair of the road about four years back, and to surveying the road
in July, 1841.
Mr. Macdowell called the attention of His Honor to the 2nd count of the information on which the Attorney-General relied,
and submitted that there was no proof that any injury had been done in the township of Longford, on the contrary, the injury had
been done in a certain highway not in the township, but in land belonging to Mr. Reed himself; a second objection was, that if this
was an offence, it should have been dealt with under the Road Act, which provided a specific penalty for offences of this description,
and that such offences were punishable
under the Road Act.
The Attorney-General replied to Mr. Macdowell's objections, and argued that the road was proved to be in the vicinity
of Norfolk Plains, and used as a public highway.
His Honor pointed out an objection, that it had not been shown that Fenton's Ford was in the district of Norfolk Plains,
neither had it been shown that Longford was a township - and also that the road had not been shown to be in the district of Norfolk
Plains - there objections His Honor considered to be fatal.
Charles Reid was charged with obstructing the highway, AOTSC 41/5.
