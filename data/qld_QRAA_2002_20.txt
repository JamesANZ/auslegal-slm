RACING APPEALS AUTHORITY
[2002] QRAA
10 October 2002
Mr Shane Robert Graham
APPEAL FROM:
A decision of the Queensland Harness Racing Board
APPEARANCES:
Mr McCarthy appeared on behalf of the Appellant
Graham, Shane v Queensland Harness Racing Board
[2002] QRAA 20
REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr L Williams AO – Chairman
This is an appeal by harness racing driver, Shane Graham, against a
conviction by the Stewards that he breached Rule 163(1)(a) of
the Rules of
Harness Racing which provides
“A driver shall not:
(a) cause or contribute to any crossing, jostling or interference”.
“And Sub-Rule 5 reads:
“For the purposes of subrule 1 ‘crossing’ occurs when a
driver changing the position of the driver’s horse,
compels another runner
to shorten stride or the driver of that other horse to pull it out of its
The Stewards allege that Graham moved from a two wide trailing position to a
three wide position in the back straight during the final
lap of a race at
Albion Park on 5 October 2002 in such a manner as to cause interference to a
horse driven by Mr R Cross who was
on his outside.
Mr McCarthy who appeared for Graham argued strongly on the appeal that it was
Cross’s action of pulling on Graham that caused
Cross’s horse to
break and fall back in the race.
Having viewed the video evidence, the Authority agrees with the finding of
the Stewards namely that Graham did move out at a time
and in such a manner as
to cause interference with Cross on his outside.
Having reviewed the penalty the Authority notes that the Stewards’
originally offered Graham the option of a fine and upon the
Authority upholding
the finding of the Stewards Mr McCarthy intimated on behalf of Graham that they
would prefer a fine to two weeks’
suspension. Accordingly the Authority
varies the penalty to a fine of $200.
The appeal deposit is forfeit.
