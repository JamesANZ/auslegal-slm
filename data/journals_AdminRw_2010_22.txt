The Commonwealth Ombudsman
In April 2009 the Commonwealth Ombudsman published the
Better Practice
Guide to Complaint Handling
. The first guide had been published by the
office in 1997; the new guide takes account of the substantial development in
handling practice in government in the past 10 years.
On 3 August 2009 the Commonwealth Ombudsman published a report entitled
Putting Things Right: compensating for defective administration,
examines the operation of the Compensation for Detriment Caused by Defective
Administration Scheme. Among other things, the
Ombudsman’s recommendations
cover the following:
• providing greater visibility for the scheme, so that the public knows
they can ask to be compensated for government error
• establishing an interdepartmental advisory or review panel to deal with
disputed or exceptional claims under the scheme and
‘best-practice’ leadership role
• using the potential offered by information technology to improve case
monitoring, provide support for decision making and
capture feedback
• dealing with ‘administrative drift’ (needless delays) in
finalising cases.
The report is available at

In November 2009 the Commonwealth Ombudsman published an issues paper,
Mistakes and Unintended Consequences—a safety net approach,
examines the problems that can arise, and options for resolving them, when
legislation has unforeseen consequences that affect
individuals harshly and are
at odds with the intent of the regime. The paper also looks at circumstances
where an agency acknowledges
it has erred when making a decision but has no
explicit power to reconsider and remake the decision.
