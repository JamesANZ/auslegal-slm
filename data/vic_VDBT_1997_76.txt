19 November, 1997
On 29 October, 1995 the parties signed a Preliminary Building Agreement
(P.B.A.) (Exhibit A) based on a sketch plan and a list of
items to be included
in a price of $140,000.
Mr Michael Frizziero states that he made an offer as representative of the
builder. This would be on or before 3/11/95. Mr Frizziero
says his offer was
that if the owners paid $10,000 in cash, he would be able to do extra work -
beyond that shown in the P.B.A.,
for the price of $140,000.
He said the owners agreed to this and arrangements were made for payment of
that amount at a later stage.
The builder prepared a final contract, signed by the parties on 3/11/95, for
a price of $130,000. Items over and above those set
out in the P.B.A. were
allowed in the final contract or related documents.
The builder maintains that at all times the full price was $140,000. He
openly admits his intention to defraud the Taxation Department
$130,000 in the contract of 3/11/95.
Except for the evidence of Mr Frizziero when he attempted to defend the
legitimacy of his receipt for $10,000 (Exhibit C), I found
the witnesses for the
builder to be open and straightforward.
For their part, the owners allege that the builder first offered to lower the
price from $140,000 if items were deleted from the P.B.A.
They acknowledge that
no items were in fact deleted.
The owners deny that the final contract allowed any benefits not contained in
Mrs Zerri claimed that her expectation was that if she paid $10,000 in cash
she would receive a $10,000 discount off the price of
$140,000, leaving $120,000
to pay. Mrs Zerri also admitted "If I didn’t make the $10,000 cash
payment the price would be $140,000".
I found both Mr & Mrs Zerri to be most unreliable witnesses. They
frequently tried to avoid answering questions put in cross
examination, or their
answers were evasive. They gave inconsistent answers throughout their
testimonies and I am satisfied that
at times the answers they gave were untrue
to their knowledge.
I reject the owners’ claim that the contract of 3/11/95 included no
benefits to them over and above what was already listed
in the P.B.A. I reject
their claims as to what they expected of the contract price after payment of
$10,000 cash as totally unreasonable,
without support and without merit.
I am satisfied that as at 3/11/95 the minds of the parties were together in
that the builder expected to be paid a total of $140,000
and the owners expected
to pay that amount.
The contract of 3/11/95 is for $130,000. The builder and his witnesses have
admitted the purpose of the contract was to avoid payment
of tax. Were the
owners aware of this illegal purpose?
It is agreed that the only explanation directly given by the builder to the
owners was to the effect that you can get tradespeople
to do more if you pay
cash. The owners claim that any advantage to the builder is entirely his
If that was all to be considered, it would be a big step to impute knowledge
of an illegal purpose to the owners; however, a number
of matters lead me to
conclude otherwise.
Mrs Xerri in her evidence in chief said that on 3/11/95, the date the
contract was signed, Mr Frizziero told her to take the $10,000
cash money out in
two lots so it wouldn’t be suspicious. She apparently instructed her
legal representative, denied by her
husband, that Mr Frizziero told her to take
the money from the bank in two amounts of less than $10,000 "so they wont be
caught out".
The obvious question is: what was suspicious or at what might they be caught
The owners were questioned as to what suspicions they might have had and as
to what they knew of the relationship of cash payments
to tax avoidance. Their
answers were unacceptable, unrealistic and untruthful. Even though Mr Frizziero
was extremely reluctant
to give a receipt for the $10,000 cash, the owners
continued to maintain that they saw nothing of which to be suspicious.
Mr Xerri admits to 12 years experience in the building industry and Mrs Xerri
has had commercial experience and said she deals with
cash all the time. They
alternated between denying and admitting that they knew a reason for requesting
cash payments was to avoid
having to put "entries through the books", thereby
avoiding taxation.
I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the owners knew the
builder’s reasons for listing the contract price at
$130,000 and that they
accepted the arrangement.
HOUSING GUARANTEE FUND LIMITED
I find that the Housing Guarantee Fund Limited had no choice but to reject
the owners’ claim that they had paid $10,000 cash
to the builder. The
Receipt (Exhibit C) and the photocopy of the owners’ bank statements
(Exhibit H2) do not indicate, on
their face value, that the Xerris paid any
money to K.L.R. Constructions or to Mr Frizziero, or that any money was paid in
with the building of a house.
As the evidence now stands, an inference can be drawn from the documents. In
fact the builder admits receipt of the payment; however,
at the time the
Housing Guarantee Fund Limited made its decision, the builder was denying such
payment and the Housing Guarantee
Fund Limited was entitled not to act on the
documents alone.
The Housing Guarantee Fund Limited decision was correct at the time.
