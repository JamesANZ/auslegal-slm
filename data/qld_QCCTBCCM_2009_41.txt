REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
application filed 18 May 2009 the applicant, as owner of Lot 113 in the
community titles scheme known as “Deepwater Point
Apartments”
Community Titles Scheme 29890 (“CTS”), claimed an adjustment of the
lot entitlements in the Contribution
Schedule for that CTS pursuant to
Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997
”), as facilitated by
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act 2003
respondent is the Body Corporate of the CTS.
to the New Community Management Statement for the CTS which was recorded on 15
December 2004, the relevant regulation module
is “ACCOMMODATION”.
The Contribution Schedule and the Interest Schedule show lot entitlements,
respectively, of 119,304
and 72,437. It is only the Contribution Schedule that
is the subject of the present claim. The entitlements in the Contribution
Schedule are not all equal, varying from 700 to 1,641.
Defence filed by the respondent on 16 July 2009, after an extension of time,
simply states that if the Tribunal is minded to make
an order that departs from
the current lot entitlements contained in the Contribution Schedule, the
Tribunal should consider that
the recommended lot entitlements for the
Contribution Schedule as contained in Table D of the Report of Del Linkhorn
Simpson (“L & S Report”) is just and equitable
pursuant to section 48 of the
. The L & S Report was
prepared to review the Leary & Partners Pty Ltd Report (“L & P
Report”) which was
attached to the Statement of Claim and upon which the
applicant relies.
order of the Tribunal made 22 July 2009 the authors of the two Reports were
required to confer and prepare a document identifying
areas of agreement and
disagreement, stating the reasons for any disagreement. That order also noted
that the parties would “prefer”
the Tribunal to determine the
dispute on the papers, if possible.
Tribunal has decided to determine the application on the papers, having received
the joint Report dated 31 July 2009 and a later
clarifying letter from Leary
& Partners Pty Ltd dated 3 August 2009.
Legislation
decision “on the papers” is a decision made pursuant to section 48
. In terms, it states that the Tribunal may decide,
relevantly, all of a proceeding from a consideration of the documents filed,
without the parties or witnesses appearing.
, it is clear from both the expert Reports that both
parties are familiar with the relevant legislation contained in sections 46 to
49 (inclusive) of that Act.
apart from mentioning that section 48(10) states that, if the Tribunal orders an
adjustment of a lot entitlement schedule,
the body corporate must as quickly as
practicable lodge a request to record a new community management statement
reflecting the adjustment
ordered, the Tribunal will not canvass the detail of
what is required for an adjustment.
Relevant judicial
for the reasons just expressed, the Tribunal will not canvass the principles,
and observations, established, and made,
by the Queensland Court of Appeal in
Fischer v Body Corporate for Centrepoint Community Titles Scheme 7779
[2004] QCA 214
[2004] 2 Qd R 638.
Expert reports
L & P Report was prepared on 6 May 2009. The L & S Report was prepared
on 10 July 2009. As already noted, the joint
Report was completed on 31 July
2009 and the clarifying letter on 3 August 2009.
can be seen, all Reports are current. Furthermore, all Reports refer to the
relevant legislative provisions and the primary principles
extracted from
for the areas of disagreement, it is clear from the general summary contained at
the end of the joint Report that the L & S
Report recommends new
entitlements that range from 67 through to 85, whereas the L & P Report
recommends new entitlements that
range from 66 to 85. Additionally, of the 143
Lots in the scheme, 46 of the proposed new entitlements for them are shown as
in each Report, 50 have a difference of a single entitlement and the
majority of the balance of the 47 Lots have a difference of
2 entitlements, with
a few showing differences of 3 or 4 entitlements and 2 showing a difference of 6
entitlements.
even though there is some difference in methodology, the differences,
unsurprisingly, between the conclusions reached in both
Reports are relatively
Nevertheless,
it is incumbent on the Tribunal to resolve the differences and to decide the
actual whole numbers that should be the
result of any adjustment that is
properly reached by a correct analysis of the law and facts.
it should be commented that it is not unusual for experts, particularly in a
field such as this, to use slightly different
methodologies (each of which
clearly has a substantive basis). But the Tribunal must make a decision as to
what the nature of the
adjustment is to be, if any.
Consideration
there is so much agreement between the expert Reports, the analysis will simply
focus on those areas of difference.
first to a consideration of the budget allowances in both the Administrative
Fund and the Sinking Fund, to a large degree
there is little difference in the
two approaches, and where there is a difference it is often to a small extent
Considering
the differences concerning the Administrative Fund expenses, the Tribunal
accepts the analysis in the L & P Report.
This is because rather than
simply averaging the fund expenditure for the particular item over the last 4
years of the operation
of this particular CTS (as L & S Report does), the L
& P Report looks at the increase (where it has occurred) in costs in
last 2 years and concludes that the budget cost is more appropriate. Since this
decision by the Tribunal is required to be made
now, where the budget has been
demonstrated to show a more accurate reflection of what the expenses are (for
the purpose of determining
whether they should be divided equally or whether
there is such a disproportionate difference which has a financial impact or
consequence
such that it is just and equitable for them to be unequal), the
approach which more accurately determines how that calculation is
to be properly
undertaken is to be preferred.
those items in both Funds which are not based upon the budget, again the
Tribunal prefers the approach of the L & P Report.
This is because for
those items which are based upon averaging, the Tribunal accepts that this
average historical costs provides
a more typical representation of probable
future costs. With regard to insurance, given the seemingly correct analysis
in the L & P Report, its approach should be accepted.
concerning these two Funds, there is the contingency that has been allowed by
the L & P Report for $37,758.00, which has
been excluded from consideration
in the L & S Report. The reason given by the former is that the contingency
item is included
to cover maintenance work of a type that does not follow a
regular cyclical pattern, as well as unforeseen factors that might increase
budgeted maintenance costs, and that, without this allowance, the Sinking Fund
would be underfunded. The latter’s approach
is that any contingency fund
should not be included because it is only a reserve allowance to cover something
that may or may not
be required for future Sinking Fund expenses.
this particular CTS is governed by the
Body Corporate and Community
Management (Accommodation Module) Regulation 2008
Accommodation
”), it pays to attend to what that states. By
section 137(1)
the Body Corporate is required to adopt a budget for each financial year for the
Sinking Fund. It is clear from documents contained
in the L & P Report that
the contingency item does appear in the present budget. By
section 137(3)(b)
Accommodation Module
provides that the Sinking Fund budget must fix
the amount to be raised by way of contribution to cover the capital amount
section 137(3)(a).
section 137(3)(a)
refers not only to
raising a reasonable capital amount to provide for necessary and reasonable
spending from the Sinking Fund for
the financial year but also “to reserve
an appropriate proportional share of amounts necessary to be accumulated to meet
anticipated
major expenditure over at least the next 9 years after the financial
year”, it is appropriate that the contingency sum should
be recognised as
a sum that this particular Body Corporate has decided falls within the statutory
requirements. This is done, of
course, in the context that
section 137(7)
states that, to remove any doubt, it is declared that the inclusion of an item
of expenditure in the budget adopted by the Body Corporate
is not, of itself,
authority for the expenditure.
the Body Corporate has fixed its contributions to be levied on the basis of its
budgets pursuant to
section 139(1)(a)
Accommodation Module
appropriate to take into account that particular contingency figure for the
purpose of deciding lot entitlements.
the more important differences are those that are discussed in the joint Report
in Table 1.
difference in methodology is the difference in allocation either on a quantity
per lot basis (favoured by the L & P Report)
or a quantity per lot area
basis (favoured by the L & S Report).
approach of the L & P Report is based upon quantity surveying methods. As
stated in the joint Report, the allocation is based
directly on the measurable
extent of body corporate property that is the subject of the expense. The
reasoning is that this uses
directly measured quantities, thereby providing a
more transparent and equitable allocation than a generic allowance such as a lot
area. The Tribunal favours that approach as there is no necessary correlation
between the actual expenses discussed that any particular
Lot generates and the
lot area of that particular lot. Hence, for those items that are based directly
upon the quantity surveying
methodology, the Tribunal prefers the approach of
the L & P Report. It is not possible to determine how the Item 7
area” should be resolved in the present proceeding. It would
appear that legal advice should be taken and the issue resolved
negotiation or the dispute resolution procedures under the
next difference in approach to be discussed is one that has no effect on the
outcome, since these both Reports appear to have
allocated the expense equally.
They are Items 10, 11 and 12 in Table 1. But the clarifying letter of 3 August
2009 shows that an
incorrect description has been used by the L & S Report.
Since the authors of the latter Report have declined to comment further,
approach of the L & P Report is accepted.
for the differences that exist between the approaches to Item 8, which deals
with the replacement of the roof membrane, the L &
P Report allocates the
sum of $7,312.31 equally because, in a multi-storey building of this style,
there is stated to be no clear
nexus between the cost of the roofing and the
area of a particular lot on any level below. In contrast, the L & S Report
the cost on a per lot area basis. The same difference in approach is
made to Item 9 which concerns the replacement of metal roof
sheeting in the sum
of $946.40. Since the L & S Report does not differentiate between the 3
individual towers and the separate
structure of 5 townhouses but, rather,
allocates them on an area occupied by each lot, the Tribunal prefers the
alternative analysis.
This is because, if no distinct difference can be seen to
arise between one lot and another in circumstances where the roof is for
advantage of all persons who use each and all of the structures on the CTS land,
an equal allocation is a more principled and
logical approach.
there are differences between the Reports on Item 4 and Item 13 (although the
latter is not allocated a number). The first
relates to repairs to the garbage
chute. The Tribunal prefers the approach of the L & P Report that it ought
to be brought into
account. In any event, besides stating that the basis of
non-allocation is that “it is such a minimum amount”, the L
Report, in any event, states that it is of equal benefit.
for Item 13, again, since it is clearly a figure that is brought into account in
budgeting, it should, as recommended by the L
& P Report, be brought into
clarifying letter of 3 August 2009 does not otherwise impinge upon these
conclusions.
in summary, the Tribunal accepts that the correct approach for this particular
building in these particular circumstances
is that which has been proposed in
the L & P Report for the reasons canvassed.
Conclusions
many applications made pursuant to section 48 of the
application involves a CTS for which the Contribution Schedule already contains
lot entitlements which are unequal in what
appears to have been an attempt to
allocate the entitlements according to perceived compliance with section 46(7)
and section 46(8)
. But those provisions deal with a
Contribution Schedule for a CTS for which development approval is given after
the commencement
of those provisions. They commenced on 4 March 2003 and,
although the latest New Community Management Statement was, as already
recorded on 15 December 2004, the Reports suggest that there was an earlier
Community Management Statement. Moreover,
was a decision handed
down in June 2004. But whatever the motivating cause, lot entitlements
differing from those in the Interest
Schedule presently apply.
concern that the Tribunal has is that an adjustment made pursuant to section 48
should not, at least in theoretical terms, be an
adjustment that is made whenever there are slight differences that arise in the
expenses which according to
are relevant expenses for determining
whether there is such disproportionality that it is just and equitable for
inequality to prevail
to the extent of such inequality. Necessarily, from year
to year there must be fluctuations in actual expenses; but this should
itself, lead to applications for adjustment on that basis alone.
all that, what Table 5 in the L & P Report shows is that the current
entitlements under the Contribution Schedule, while
unequal, do not in any way
accurately reflect the extent of the inequality arising from the
disproportionality of the expenses which
can be allocated to each different Lot.
What is convincing about that analysis is that the variation that results from
the costs allocated with current entitlements against the costs
allocated with recommended entitlements shows a difference which
is reasonably
significant, particularly with respect to those Lots for which the differences
are in the order of thousands of dollars.
the Tribunal is convinced that:
respective lot entitlements are presently not equal, the evidence shows that
they should continue to be not equal, because
it is just and equitable in the
circumstances for such inequality to prevail;
nevertheless,
the present inequality does not show an inequality which can be justified on a
just and equitable basis in the existing
circumstances; and
consequently,
the lot entitlements in the Contribution Schedule should be adjusted to show
inequality but only to the extent to which
it is just and equitable in these
circumstances.
consequence, the Tribunal will order that an adjustment be made such that the
lot entitlements for each and every lot in this CTS
be adjusted so that they be

schedule” entitlement column
in Table 5 of the L & P Report.
party has raised the issue of costs.
Nevertheless,
the Tribunal is of the provisional view that given that both Reports are
essentially to the same effect, given that
the Contribution Schedule was
required in these particular circumstances to be adjusted and given that the
relevant strength of both
cases is, therefore, little different, there is no
reason to depart from the “main purpose” of the costs’
, being that the parties should pay their own
costs unless the interests of justice require otherwise.
Nevertheless,
since the matter of costs has not been raised, both parties will have 7 days in
which to make written submissions, if
