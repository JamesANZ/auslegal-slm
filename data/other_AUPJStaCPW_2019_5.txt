3. Point Wilson Waterside Infrastructure Remediation
3.1 The Department of Defence (Defence) seeks approval from the Committee to
proceed with the proposed Point Wilson Waterside Infrastructure
Remediation
project, at Point Wilson, Victoria.
3.2 Point Wilson Explosives Area (PWEA) is located on the north shore of
Corio Bay, approximately 50 kilometres west of Melbourne.
According to
The PWEA is the sole Defence-owned importation facility capable of bulk movement
of explosive ordnance (EO). It is a significant
maritime asset, currently
consisting of a 2.4 kilometre long jetty and 168 metre long wharf capable of
accommodating EO container
3.3 Defence
states that PWEA has been closed since 2008 due to ‘unsafe
structural’ conditions, details of which can be
found under the
‘Need for the works’ section of this
The purpose of this
proposal is to ‘remediate the PWEA waterside infrastructure in order to
enable to recommencement’
of EO importation at the
3.4 The estimated cost of the project is $218.9 million (excluding GST).
3.5 The project was referred to the Committee on 28 June 2018.
Conduct of the
3.6 Following referral, the inquiry was publicised on the Committee’s
website and via media release.
3.7 The Committee received two submissions and two confidential submissions.
A list of submissions can be found at Appendix A.
3.8 On 24 August 2018, the Committee conducted a site inspection at Point
Wilson Explosives Area. On the same day, the Committee
also conducted a public
and in camera hearing. A transcript of the public hearing is available on the
Committee’s website.
Need for the works
3.9 In its submission, Defence notes that the jetty and wharf at PWEA
‘were constructed between 1958 and 1961, and the facility
was officially
opened in 1961’.
according to Defence:
PWEA has exceeded its anticipated design life. In 2008, a structural report
assessed that the wharf and jetty structure had deteriorated
to the point that
it is unsafe and inoperable until remediation work is completed. As a result,
the waterside facility was deemed
non-operational for bulk EO operations. In
2016, further safety shortcomings were identified, which led to a decision to
all access to the jetty and wharf, with access by exception to address
critical safety issues
3.10 Defence
outlined the safety issues identified:
Concrete deck deterioration.
The deterioration of the
concrete deck, due to chloride ingress into the concrete, has led to spalling of
the concrete soffit and
corrosion of the steel reinforcement resulting in loss
of structural capacity.
Steel crosshead corrosion.
The breakdown of the coating and
subsequent corrosion of the steel crosshead has led to a reduction in the
structural capacity of
the members.
Steel stringer beam halving joints corrosion
. The stiffeners
and connection plates on the half joints on the stringers have corroded to such
an extent that the structural capacity
has been significantly impacted.
Steel piles corrosion.
The protective coating that was
installed to protect the steel piles has deteriorated over time. This, in
conjunction with higher
rates of corrosion in the splash zone, has resulted in
the steel piles undergoing various rates of corrosion. The jetty piles have
been assessed as being in reasonable condition (generally due to their
protection by the existing cathodic protection system). The
wharf and link span
piles are not protected by cathodic protection and are in significantly worse
condition than the jetty piles.
Dilapidated timber fender piles.
Necking of the timber piles
below the waterline and marine borers within the timber have significantly
reduced the berthing load
capacity of the timber fender piles. In 2017, this
degradation reached a point where the risk of failure and subsequent collapse
into the sea was considered a potential public safety risk to mariners and the
environment. Due to this risk, all timber fender
piles have recently been
3.11 As a result of these issues, Defence has been importing EO through Port
Alma, a privately owned port 60 kilometres south of Rockhampton,
Queensland.
3.12 According to Defence, reliance on Port Alma as the sole point of
importation represents the following risks:
▪ Port Alma is a commercial port, and its availability is constrained
due to continual competition for berthing slots with resource
companies. Access is not guaranteed and quite often time pressures and
difficult during high port congestion.
▪ Port Alma does not have any onsite EO storage facilities and requires
transfer to the Queensland storage reserve of Bajool,
some 30 kilometres from
Port Alma. Bajool has limited EO storage capacity, requiring further overflow
storage in a disused quarry
at the remote Shoalwater Bay Training Area,
approximately 130 kilometres north of Port Alma. This leads to additional
security and handling risks, and costs due to limited infrastructure
at Shoalwater Bay. This overflow storage access will be limited
in the future
with Shoalwater Bay experiencing increased training usage by the Australian
Defence Force and foreign forces.
▪ The port can only handle shipping containers rather than pallets,
limiting its utility. It has ageing and limited facilities
(some of which are
50 years old), there is potential that it may close for refurbishment or upgrade
in the near to medium future.
There is also no guarantee on the future use of
Port Alma as Defence is not seen as a priority for a commercial port.
▪ Port Alma is vulnerable to inclement weather; being closed due to
king tides and weather events on a number of occasions.
The roads to Bajool are
poor and subject to risks and constraints as they are single lane width and have
closed shoulders.
▪ Increased workarounds and inefficiencies incur an extra cost of
approximately $1 to $1.5 million per shipment in additional
transport, handling,
security, and port fees, all of which leads to increased inefficiencies and
operational stress on the EO supply
chain. There are considerable distances to
the main EO depot sites in New South Wales and Victoria, and it can take months
all EO is finally distributed around the EO network.
▪ It creates complexity in quarantine management with a number of local
agreements in place regarding the transport of contaminated
containers at
Bajool, which could be cancelled at any stage. Defence has on occasion been
instructed to unload within 24 hours,
making it difficult to organise
biosecurity officers to support
3.13 At the public hearing, Defence gave the Committee further detail on how
the contaminated container issue added additional risks
to Defence’s
handling of EO through Port Alma:
The biosecurity aspects at Port Alma are very limited, and they can’t hold
explosive containers on the site for any length
of time. So those containers,
if they come through with any sort of biocontaminant... are currently plastic
wrapped and then trucked
the 40 kilometres to Bajool, where there is a treatment
3.14 Defence
told the Committee that ‘returning PWEA to operational status is therefore
critical to the sustainment and surety
of the Defence EO supply chain, and will
contribute to a broad range of Defence
capabilities’.
3.15 At the public hearing, Defence further stated that:
Point Wilson provides us with the additional strategic capacity to import our
explosives. It is a dedicated, Defence-owned and controlled
refurbished, it provides a guaranteed secure and reliable importation capacity,
mitigates our quarantine risks that we
currently have and minimises the amount
of road transport that [Defence subjects its] munitions
3.16 The PWEA
acting as the single point of entry for bulk EO importation is important for the
realisation of the objectives of the
Explosives Ordnance Logistics Reform
Program (EOLRP), examined by the Committee in
3.17 Furthermore, according to Defence:
If the project does not proceed, the entire dilapidated wharf and jetty would
need to be demolished for public safety at an estimated
cost of $60-100
Committee is satisfied that the need for the works exists.
Options considered
3.19 Defence considered a range of options in developing this proposal.
Firstly, Defence stated that it considered the suitability
of other bulk EO
importation sites, such as Twofold Bay in New South Wales and Wyndham Port in
Western Australia.
3.20 According to Defence:
Twofold Bay was considered not suitable due to an insufficient EO licence, a
lack of onsite EO storage, no ability to manage or accommodate
importation
levels of EO containers, no direct access to major roads and rail networks,
close proximity to private and commercial
businesses and public beaches. The
Wyndham Port was found to be extremely remote with no major roads and rail
infrastructure access,
limited access through the wet season, increased
operating costs due to remote location and ship limitations due to tidal ranges
other potential, existing sites were ruled out, Defence told the Committee that
it considered a ‘broad range of options’
to ‘meet the
requirements of EO bulk’ importation at PWEA:
In the initial development phase, options ranged from minimal refurbishment to
complete replacement and it was determined that major
refurbishment was the
preferred option as it best meets the capability requirements and is best value
result of this, Defence considered two options in further detail:
Option One – Remediate wharf with 2.4 kilometre single lane
The remediation of the 2.4 kilometre jetty consists of a 2,255 metre
single lane jetty and 125 metre link span connecting to the new
wharf, with
associated supporting infrastructure. This was considered a low risk option,
which operationally represents the status
quo. This option was considered to
have significant benefits despite the larger capital cost as it decreases the
risk of inoperability
or a serious incident.
Option Two – Use of a floating deck to reduce jetty length.
A floating deck is a large steel, subdivided pontoon which is capable of
carrying EO via transhipment between the commercial EO ship,
at anchor, and an
unloading wharf. A floating deck can be considered to provide the same
capability as a standard wharf (albeit
significantly larger as EO containers are
temporarily stored on the floating deck) and would be equipped with a range of
fittings, services and buildings to that of a traditional wharf.
Several floating deck sub-options were considered and a medium
sized floating
deck, and an 880 metre single lane jetty including passing bays to allow two way
traffic was found to be the most
3.23 Defence informed the Committee that Option One was selected, despite
requiring higher capital expenditure. This is because Option
Two required the
introduction of a new platform, technology, and operating model, which in turn
would bring increased complexity,
and safety and other
Scope of the works
3.24 Defence split the proposed works into five project elements:
▪ Project Element One: Jetty. Refurbish the 2,255 metre single lane
(two-way) jetty with passing bays, consisting of a new
jetty deck and stringer
beams with strengthened existing piles, and crossheads where required.
▪ Project Element Two: Wharf. Construct a new 135 metre wharf and 125
metre link span consisting of a new deck with new piles,
crossheads and stringer
beams, comprising of:
− Demolition of the existing wharf.
− Construct new steel piles, concrete beams, and deck in an enhanced
configuration that is 30 metres shorter and six metres
wider for improved safety
and operational capability. This will accommodate EO ships up to 136 metres in
length, 18,000 tonnage
displacement and laden draft of 8.5 metres.
− Install new mooring dolphins.
− Construct a single boat landing abutting the end of the Amenities
building for use by line boats and/or security vessels.
▪ Project Element Three: Waterside amenities. A new single-storey
waterside amenities building to provide working accommodation
and amenities for
the stevedores, line crew and operators.
▪ Project Element Four: Landside infrastructure. Landside
infrastructure upgrades comprising:
− Demolition of existing buildings.
− A new single-storey concrete facility to house the pump sets
supporting the waterside fire and potable water infrastructure.
− Remediation of the causeway and approach road, including associated
landscaping.
▪ Project Element Five: Engineering Services. Services upgrades,
comprising:
− The waterside infrastructure is planned to be powered from an
extended 22 kilovolts cable supply that is reticulated along
the wharf to the
substation located within the Amenities building.
− The site’s combined water and fire main shall be upgraded and
reticulated to the Pump House and Tanks. A new potable
water main shall service
the Amenities Building and wharf wash-down facility. The fire main shall be
reticulated along the wharf
to the fire hydrants, hose reals and monitors on the
− A new septic holding tank will be replaced below the Amenities
− New communications cabling shall be reticulated to the Fire Pump
House and Amenities building for the emergency phones and
fire control
− The installation of an electrical cathodic protection system on the
marine infrastructure to protect against
3.25 Subject to Parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence
late 2018 and be completed in
3.26 The Committee finds that the proposed scope of works is suitable for the
works to meet its purpose.
consultation
3.27 As it does for all projects examined by the Committee, Defence provided
a report on its community consultation process for this
3.28 According to this submission, Defence placed advertisements in the
Geelong Advertiser and Herald Sun newspapers, regarding two
information sessions which were held at Corio Central Shopping Centre and
Cobradah House, Bell Post Hill, both on 11 June
3.29 Additionally, Defence wrote letters offering formal briefings to a range
of potential stakeholders, including state and federal
Members of Parliament,
local government representatives, relevant Victorian Government departments and
authorities, business and
commercial groups, and a range of community groups and
local businesses and
organisations.
3.30 At the public hearing, Defence was questioned about the extent of its
community consultation, and specifically whether Melbourne
Water – Point
Wilson’s nearest neighbour – had been contacted directly.
3.31 Defence responded that while Melbourne Water had not been directly
‘the normal
community consultation’ with details of the project being available
‘on a website and
advertised’.
3.32 Furthermore, the Committee questioned whether Defence had undertaken
consultations in the areas through which EO received at
Point Wilson would
transit on its way to EO storage and distribution facilities. Defence responded
The specific roads taken become highly sensitive in terms of not wanting to tell
the public, but more so from a security point of
view. Broadcasting widely
where the EO is moving around potentially opens up some form of threat from
people who may have nefarious
ideas in their heads about how to use
Cost of the works
3.33 The project has a budget of $218.9 million, exclusive of GST. It
includes the cost of construction, management and design fees,
contingencies and
an escalation allowance.
3.34 Defence provided further detail on project costings in its confidential
submission and during an in-camera hearing.
3.35 The Committee is satisfied that the costings for the project provided to
it have been adequately assessed by the proponent entity.
Committee comment
3.36 The Committee is aware that the need for this project is to support one
to three bulk importations of EO per
The cost of the project is
$218.9 million and Defence has indicated efficiencies that could be achieved
through this project, as
opposed to continuing to rely on Port Alma as the
primary site of EO bulk importation to Australia.
3.37 The Committee was informed that the jetty and wharf at PWEA were
assessed as being non-operational in 2008 for bulk EO importation
and Defence
was required to use a commercial port, Port Alma, for importation of bulk EO.
The Committee was informed that there were
significant risks in using Port Alma
as it is a commercial port and also subject to transport and biosecurity
3.38 The Committee notes that the conduct of these works is important to
achieving efficiencies in both the EO network and Defence
expenditure on
maintaining and using this network. The Committee is also aware that the EO
network efficiencies that will be achieved
under the EOLRP can only be fully
realised if Point Wilson is refurbished and again acts as the primary point for
bulk EO importation.
3.39 The Committee’s function, however, is not to ensure efficiencies
for Defence but to ensure that the most effective use
is made of the moneys to
be expended on the work.
3.40 The Committee did not feel that the necessity for carrying out the
works, presented by Defence, was entirely compelling in relation
redevelopment of Point Wilson purely on the basis of the two or three
importations a year, given that it has already been
using Port Alma since the
decommissioning of the wharf and jetty at PWEA.
3.41 The Committee therefore requests that Defence keeps it updated on
progress and costings in relation to each of the project elements
by providing
an annual progress report as well as detailed reports which provide the final
costs of each element once completed.
Defence should also provide detail of any
commercial sharing opportunities or use that it has been able to pursue.
3.42 On community consultation, the Committee notes that in its consultations
for this project, Defence omitted Point Wilson’s
nearest neighbour from
being directly contacted. The Committee encourages Defence to continue to
consult widely on this project,
as it generally does for all its projects.
3.43 Furthermore, the Committee is aware that the Victorian Government has
confirmed that these proposed works are unlikely to impact
current or future
port projects in Victoria. This was a key issue for the Committee, especially
in light of the fact that the Victorian
Government is considering future options
for the development of a second container port in the Bay West area. The
Committee encourages
Defence to continue to consult with the relevant state
government ministers in relation to this project, particularly as the option
a Bay West second container port is finalised.
3.44 Additionally, the Committee is not convinced by the argument put by
Defence that consulting with communities along the EO transportation
not desirable. In the Committee’s view, it is entirely possible for
Defence to consult with local and state members
between Point Wilson and key EO
storage and distribution sites like Myambat and Mangalore.
3.45 As such, the Committee encourages Defence to further widen its
consultation in regard to EO importation and distribution routes,
ensure that local communities know that dangerous goods are being transported
through their general area. This can be done
without disclosing the specific
routes that will be taken, thereby incurring additional security risks, and will
act to ensure that
local residents in these areas have a forum to raise concerns
and have these concerns addressed.
Recommendation 1
3.46 The Committee recommends that the House of Representatives resolve,
pursuant to
Section 18(7)
Public Works Committee Act 1969
is expedient to carry out the following proposed works: Point Wilson Waterside
Infrastructure Remediation project.
3.47 Proponent entities must notify the Committee of any changes to the
project scope, time, cost, function or design. The Committee
also requires that
a post-implementation report be provided within three months of a project
completion. A report template can be
found on the Committee’s website.
Recommendation 2
3.48 The Committee requests that the Department of Defence provide the
Committee with an annual progress report for the Point Wilson
Infrastructure Remediation project as well as detailed reports which provide the
final costs of each element once completed.
Defence should also provide the
detail of any commercial sharing opportunities or use that it has been able to
