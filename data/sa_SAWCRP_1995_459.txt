RE: MEMEN AND PASMINCO METALS-BHAS (No.5)
(1995) 8 WCRP Determination 95-0459
Determination No. 95-0459
Workers’ Compensation Review Panel
MEMEN v. PASMINCO METALS-BHAS
(06733297/01/04)
Determination of Review Panel made on 1st September
Review Officer Mason
The applicant worker and respondent employer in this matter are now in
dispute about costs, specifically the worker’s claimed
out of pocket
expenses in relation to his attendances at hearings of the merits of this
He is claiming 6 days’ wages loss, 4 160 km mileage
and $240 meals and car parking.
By letter dated 21st July 1995, the
employer has rejected that claim. The worker has responded by lodging a new
application for review.
I do not think a new application for review is
necessary; to the extent that an ancillary issue is not yet resolved, I remain
of the original proceedings. However, the new application is an
effective enough way to bring the matter to my attention.
The question is
governed by section 92a, and perhaps
Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, 1986
(“the Act”). There
has been recent authoritative interpretation by the Workers Compensation Appeal
Tribunal in its decision
WorkCover v. Sloane
(1995) 7 WCATR 143
[1995] SAWCAT 53
, but that decision is under
appeal to the Full Supreme Court, and the appeal is due to be heard next
As important guidance will no doubt emerge from the Supreme
Court’s judgment, I consider that nothing is to be gained by calling
matter on for submissions until that judgment is available.
Additionally,
as it appears that the parties are now dealing with this matter without
involving their respective solicitors, I will
if possible arrange to call the
matter on at Port Pirie, to avoid still more mileage claims being added onto the
DETERMINATION
Accordingly, I determine
that further consideration of this matter be adjourned until a date to be fixed,
appeal has been decided.
