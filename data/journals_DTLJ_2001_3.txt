United States Copyright Act
(the US Act), like its
Australian counterpart,
grants copyright to the author of an original literary work.
Where a number of works are
collated, a
new copyright may also arise in the collation, or collective work.
This occurs where the collective

there would
be gaps in this electronic history. The authors' argument
was that the

but rather a different use. Consequently, as no permission had been

The Supreme Court decision
Ginsburg delivered the majority opinion of the
Court. Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer agreed, delivered a
majority found that the actions of the publishers were
not within section 201(c) as the articles had not been distributed as a

distributed
the articles standing alone and not in context.
As a result, both the
electronic publishers had infringed the authors' copyright.
to the Court, the databases did not constitute
'revisions' of the original publications. The articles were presented
different way. Divorced of the original context, each article could be
as a separate item. In one of the digital
products the graphics and
were also different. Therefore, it could not be said that the digital
reproduced the
articles as 'part of' or as a 'revision' of the original
publication. The articles could more readily be viewed as part of a new
compendium, or, alternatively, as no longer part of a collective work
as presented individually.
publishers attempted to make an analogy between their
products, and microfilm and microfiche, arguing that the transfer of a
between media should not alter the character of that work for copyright
purposes. The Court found this analogy wanting.
Microfilm typically contains a photographic reproduction
of a periodical. Articles appear in exactly the same context, and with
the same formatting, as they did in the original publication. The
placing the individual articles in a digital database
was more than

articles were
published for the purposes of section 201(c). The
aggregation of a
number of editions of periodicals within one database did not

not matter that the revisions might look and feel quite different from

used. Therefore, the
emphasis that the majority placed on the differences in formatting and
was unwarranted. As long as each
electronic reproduction specifically

that publication and the location of the article within that
publication, it
could be seen as a part of a revision. The electronic
files contained
entire editorial content of the original edition of the New York Times
day. The articles, therefore,
did not stand-alone. The collection of a
of editions of the publications was analogous to placing single
editions in a
public library or bookstore.
The fact that an individual user could view or print
copies of the individual articles did not change the nature of the

different, for
example, than storing a newspaper on microfiche.

section 201(c). At the time it was enacted, the developments in
digitisation
which provided the background to this litigation would not have been
anticipated. Copyright laws should only restrict the dissemination

It should also promote the broad public
availability of literature, music and the arts.

Where a freelance author authorises a publisher to use an article as

publishers, this advantage may prove
to be artificial.

Determining
when a collective work or compilation is
original enough to attract copyright protection has been the subject of
debate, both judicial and academic.
The recent Federal Court decision in
Telstra Corporation
Limited v Desktop Marketing Pty Ltd
illustrates the issues. Telstra Corporation Limited
(Telstra) had alleged that Desktop Marketing Pty Ltd had infringed its
in the white and yellow pages telephone directories (the
directories).
respondent, Desktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd (DtMS)
had produced three CD Rom products which Telstra alleged infringed its
in the directories. These were:

The primary
data for all these products came from the
Telstra directories, although the information was changed in some minor
(for example, the expansion of abbreviations, and the
incorporation of
some different headings).
The Telstra

purposes of the Australian Act. The issue before the court was whether

decision, Finkelstein J considered that,
as a judge sitting at first instance, the Australian approach of
following UK
authorities
should continue. He found that copyright existed both in
directories (as there was much evidence that skill and effort had been
in their creation) and also the headings used in the yellow pages
(following the authority of
Lamb v Evans
in which copyright was found to
exist in the headings used
in a trade directory.)
the threshold of protection for a compilation of
factual data involves balancing a number of policy issues, which were
in this decision. On the one hand, to grant protection too
would limit the ability of authors to build on earlier works,
progress. On the other hand, the collection of factual material is
essential to
the economy. Databases provide information

gives some further guidance as to what will be a fair dealing.
the purpose and character of the dealing and the nature of the work are
(section 40(2)). It will be a fair
dealing for the purposes of research
study where a reasonable portion is taken (section 40(3)). Ten percent
pages of a work, or, where it is an electronic work, ten
the total work, is deemed to be a reasonable portion (section
10(2A)). Whether or not a greater amount constitutes a fair dealing
will depend
on the facts. The reproduction of
an article by a publisher is unlikely
within any of the fair dealing categories. See the decision in
Moore v Neville Jeffress Pidler Pty Ltd
(1990) 37 FCR 99
where Beaumont J
rejected an argument that the reproduction and collation of news
clippings was
for the purposes of research and
study. Although it may have been used
research or study, it was the purpose of the person making the
reproduction
that was relevant,
and in this case that purpose was to make a
commercial gain
from providing a service. Further, it was held that the defence of fair
for the purpose of reporting of news was unavailable. This defence only
where the reproduction is contained in a
newspaper, magazine or similar
periodical.
The situation may be
different where an
individual compiles a database for the purposes of their own research
However, the
reproduction of an entire article is unlikely to be a
portion, especially where the researcher already possesses a hard

There is an overlap between the implied licence and implied contractual
as a licence may exist as a contractual term. The distinction
may also exist in the absence of a binding contract. See

Trumpet Software Pty Ltd v OzeMail Pty Ltd
[1996] FCA 560
(1996) 34 IPR 481
it was held there that although an implied licence existed for the
distribution
of shareware, it did not extend to the distribution
of that shareware
altered form. Therefore, even where an implied licence is found to
scope will need to be carefully
considered.
This was relevant to the decision, as one of the grounds for the Court
the relief sought was that it would be contrary to
the public interest
Court to grant an injunction preventing publication of the MSDS's for
reasons. It was stated that
was difficult to conceive of a situation
court would grant an injunction the effect of which would deprive
public of the benefit of information necessary for their safety.
The test for proving an implied licence exists has proven to be a hard
satisfy in other contexts. For example, in
Fylde Microsystems
Ltd v Key Radio
Systems Ltd
[1998] Info TLR 374
the defendant had requested
the plaintiff to
develop a circuit board for a mobile radio which were to be loaded with
software known
as Keyport. The defendant had also used the software in
radios. The defendant argued that, if the plaintiff owned the copyright
the software (which was in dispute), the defendant had an implied
to use it. This argument was put forward on the basis
that there had
collaborative venture where neither party paid the other for work done,
a result, a licence for each
party to use the outcome should be implied
reasons of commercial efficacy. Laddie J found that such a term was
nor reasonable.
