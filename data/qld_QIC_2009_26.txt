INDUSTRIAL COURT OF QUEENSLAND
Workers' Compensation
and Rehabilitation Act 2003
s. 561(1) - appeal against decision of
industrial commission
Troy John Clarke AND Q-COMP (C/2008/4) (No. 2)
PRESIDENT HALL
8 September 2009
This is an Appeal pursuant to s. 561(1) of the
Workers’ Compensation
and Rehabilitation Act 2003
(the Act) against a decision of the Queensland
Industrial Relations Commission given on 24 December 2007 (now reported at
The hearing of the Appeal has been delayed to enable the
Appellant to seek legal assistance and/or achieve a sufficient state of
and emotional composure to argue the Appeal himself. In the event, the
Appellant did argue his case. I accept that the
Appellant, who tells me that he
did not do well at school, has a genuine and not feigned difficulty in
understanding the Act and
the judicial process. However, I also have to accept
that the Appeal is misconceived.
The Commission declined to act upon the
evidence of Dr Murrell on the ground that Dr Murrell had become too close to the
who was her patient and had become his advocate. There are not
incontrovertible facts to demonstrate that the Commission’s
finding was
erroneous: neither is there uncontested testimony pointing decisively to error.
On the face of the transcript, the finding
is neither contrary to compelling
inference nor glaringly improbable. This Court is not entitled to set the
finding aside.
Absent the evidence of Dr Murrell, the only case available
to the Appellant to satisfy the definition of "injury" at s. 32(1) of the
is that the likelihood of his condition (pemphigus vulgaris) being caused by his
work environment (operating on a genetic predisposition)
is so high that one may
properly infer that the condition did arise out of his work environment and that
his work environment was
a significant contributing factor to the contraction of
the disease. Such a case cannot be sustained on the evidence.
Commission reproduced comments by Dr Animesh Sinha in an email to the
Appellant’s then solicitors. In its original format
(see Exhibit 11B) the
email was in the following terms:
"i attempted to orient my report to showcase the role of environmental
factors in pemphigus in as positive a manner as the medical
and scientific
literature allows.
but let me be clear. while the role of environmental factors in autoimmune
diseases in general (and likely pemphigus vulgaris) is
accepted, direct links
backed by strong, reproducible, non-anecdotal data implicating specific specific
[sic] environmental agents
is lacking for most diseases, including pemphigus
vulgaris. also, please keep in mind that environmental agents in this sense can
refer to the broad universe of infectious, stress-related, and chemical/drug
related substances/molecules.
as such, in my opinion, no expert in the field could conclusively link a
specific environmental agent to the development of (this)
disease (pemphigus
vulgaris), with the possible exception of the drug d-penicillamine. moreover,
in this case, i have not seen any
evidence that confirms mr clarke was directly
exposed to any of the pesticides and other substances reported in the literature
in my report, either during the line of, or outside of work. do you
have such documentation? even in this case, it would be difficult
to conclude
that a particular agent was the sole or primary cause of disease that no doubt
also requires a genetic predisposition.".
Dr Sinha's evidence about
possible links between the condition and exposure to pesticides, herbicides and
metal vapours are subject
to the qualifications in the quoted comments. In any
event there was no evidence that the Appellant had been exposed to pesticides,
herbicides and metal vapour (or the drug d-penicillamine) in the course of his
employment. In consequence, neither was there evidence
of the duration of any
such exposure, a matter which Dr Sinha considered to be material.
evidence of Dr Reid was entirely adverse to the Appellant.
It has been
contended on the Appeal that the commission failed to address the timing of the
onset of the Appellant's condition (about
3 to 4 months after the commencement
of employment). With respect, the Commission recorded Dr Sinha's opinion
"... exposure to a particular environmental agent usually occurred weeks to
months before the disease exhibited itself. However,
exposure some 12 months
before to a particular environmental factor could not be ruled out. Where there
were several potential environmental
exposures, where timing of a potential
source was at issue, Dr Sinha's experience would lead him to go with the more
acute exposure
as the probably [sic] source, albeit that it may be more distant
in time from the occurrence of the disease.",
and recorded the evidence of Dr Reid that the disease could appear a long
time after first contact with the trigger. In my view,
the evidence established
that the Appellant's employment was a setting for the development of his
condition but did not establish
that the employment was a real and effective
cause of the condition.
I dismiss the Appeal. I reserve all questions as
