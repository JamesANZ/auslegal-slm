March 2007 the late [Name] (the testator) was referred to the Respondent Lawyer
by her family lawyer [Lawyer name], for work to:
an Enduring Power of Attorney, Medical Power of Attorney, and a Last Will and
Testament (the Documents); and
as co-executor of the Estate of the testator (the Estate).
his letter to the testator dated 2 April 2007, the Respondent Lawyer noted that
in an effort to avoid any suggestion of conflict of interest
Mr Lawyer Name 1]

obligation to prepare
[the Documents]”.
Documents were provided to the testator by the Respondent Lawyer’s office

Lawyer, [Name 2] and {Lawyer Name 1] were the appointed

Issue under
investigation
issue which is the subject of the complaint is the Respondent Lawyer’s
failure, at the time of undertaking the work, to
inform the testator in writing
of the following:
he was entitled to claim a commission from the Estate for executorial work
performed, and for [Law Practice Name] to charge the
Estate for legal costs in
relation to the administration; and
testator’s right to appoint an alternative executor who may not claim
commission.
Investigation
complaint was received by the Commissioner’s office on 26 October
22 December 2016 the Commissioner’s office commenced an investigation into
the conduct raised as a disciplinary matter under
section 282 of the Uniform
receiving submissions from the Respondent Lawyer that the complaint has been
made outside the time limit prescribed in section
272(1) of the Uniform Law, on
24 February 2017 - pursuant to section 272(1)(b) of the same Act - the
Commissioner’s office
waived the three-year time limit for the making of
the complaint.
30 July 2018, the Commissioner’s office wrote to the Respondent Lawyer
advising that it was likely to make a finding that
the Respondent Lawyer had
engaged in unsatisfactory professional conduct, and also advising of the
proposed orders it intended to

10 March 2017, in his response to the concerns raised, the Respondent Lawyer
conceded the following:
I did not inform
in writing of the matters
[which are the subject of the
“with the benefit of hindsight, I now appreciates that I, too,
should have informed
[the testator]
in his letter to her of the
[which are the subject of the concern]”.
Additionally,
on 10 March 2017 the Respondent Lawyer submitted to the Commissioner’s
office that upon drafting the Documents
for the testator, he was of the belief
that [Lawyer Name 1] (being her regular solicitor) would provide advice to the
testator and
respond to any questions about the Documents. This position is
consistent with the second paragraph of the Respondent Lawyer’s
the testator of 2 April 2007, which notes “
your legal practitioner
[Lawyer Name 1]
will advise you to ensure that you have second opinion in
respect of each of the documents
fact that [Lawyer Name 1] was available to provide the testator with a second
and/or alternative opinion (as the Respondent Lawyer
submits) is irrelevant to
the Respondent Lawyer’s duty and obligations owed to his
Relevant law
complaint is about conduct that occurred in 2007.
At the time the conduct
occurred, the
Legal Profession Act
(the LPA) and the Conduct
Rules applied.
Rule 10 of the Conduct Rules provides that
practitioner who receives instructions from a client to draw a will appointing
the practitioner an executor must inform
the client in writing before the client
signed the will –
10.1.1 of any entitlement of the
practitioner to claim commission;
10.1.2 of the inclusion in the will
of any provision entitling the practitioner to charge legal costs in relation to
the administration
of the Estate; and
10.1.3 if the practitioner has
an entitlement to claim commission, that the person could appoint as executor a
person who might make
no claim for commission”
to section 4.4.4(a) of the LPA, conduct consisting of a contravention of the
Conduct Rules is conduct capable of constituting
unsatisfactory professional
conduct or professional misconduct.
the purposes of the Savings and Transitional Provisions set out in Schedule 4 to
the Uniform Law, in particular, clause 2 and
27, conduct is capable of amounting
to unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct for the
purposes of section
298 of the Uniform Law, on the basis that the same conduct
was capable of amounting to unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional
misconduct for the purposes of the like provisions contained in the
Characterisation of the conduct
the reasons outlined above, I find that the Respondent Lawyer breached Rule 10
of the Conduct Rules by failing to advise the testator
in writing:
he was entitled to claim a commission from the Estate of executorial work
performed, and for [Law Practice Name] to charge the
Estate for legal costs in
relation to the administration; and
testator’s right to appoint an alternative executor who may not claim
commission.
find that the Respondent Lawyer’s conduct is properly characterised as
unsatisfactory professional conduct because it occurred
in connection with legal
practice and falls short of the standard of competence and diligence that a
member of the public is entitled
to expect of a reasonably competent
do not find the Respondent Lawyer’s conduct is properly characterised as
professional misconduct because the conduct does
not amount to a substantial or
consistent failure to reach or maintain a reasonable standard of competence and
diligence. Nor is
it sufficiently serious to justify a finding that the
Respondent Lawyer is not a fit and proper person to engage in legal
Determination
light of the above and having considered all of the evidence and relevant law, I
determine that it is fair and reasonable in all
the circumstances to make the
orders detailed above.
Further, in arriving at my decision to make the above
orders, the following factors have been taken into account:
Respondent Lawyer was discharged from his role as executor of the Estate as of
18 November 2016 pursuant to
section 34(1)(b)
Administration and
Probate Act
Respondent Lawyer agreed not to make any claim for commission in respect of the
Estate. I note that this position was reflected
