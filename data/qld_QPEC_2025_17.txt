Introduction
Notice of Appeal filed 22 August 2023, the appellant appeals against the
decision of the respondent dated 16 June 2023, on
the basis of characterisation
of that decision as being “to refuse part of a development
application” made in relation
to land located at 91 Baaring Drive Karana
Downs and more particularly described as Lot 220 on Registered Plan 177219
[2] There is no
issue raised in respect of the timing of the appeal, in circumstances where,
after receipt by the appellant of the
decision, on 19 June
change representations were
with the determination to
reject the change representations being communicated on 9 August
turning to the specific issues arising in this appeal, the essential facts are
not in dispute and may be noted as follows:
(a) On 20 February 2023, the appellant lodged with the respondent, a Form 56
notice as to its appointment as a private certifier
for the proposed
construction of a “storage shed” on the Land, which was acknowledged
by the respondent as completed,
on the same
(b) On 1 March 2023, the appellant also lodged a development application in
respect of that proposed
development.
(c) By email dated 6 March 2023,
the respondent requested revision of the development application so as to record
the name of the property owner and upon submission
of an amended Form
it was on 26 April
confirmed that the
application appeared to satisfy lodgement requirements, with a fee quote
generated and that required fee was then
(d) By email dated 16 May 2023,
the respondent sent an information request to the appellant, which included the
Building envelope
The proposed setting of the shed results in a reduced side (eastern) boundary
setback that is considered to adversely impact on the
amenity and privacy of
residents on the adjoining lot. Provide amended plans that observe:
increased side (eastern) boundary setback to 1500mm; or
Alternatively,
provide neighbour consent from the property owner of 87 Baaring Dr. Kawana Downs
(e) By email dated 30 May
the appellant provided the
respondent with further information, including the consent of the neighbouring
property owners of 87 Baaring
Drive Kawana Downs.
(f) After an email indicating that the respondent would then proceed to finalise
an assessment and decision, by email dated 19 June
2023 the appellant was given
a development permit,
amongst other things recorded the following:
(i) a statement in the decision notice that “there are no referral agency
requirements relating to this application”;
(ii) a stamp on the approved plans stating:
“This referral agency response does not permit or imply consent for the
removal of vegetation protected under the Natural
Assets Local Law”;
(iii) a stamp on the approved plans, stating:
Standard Building Regulations
This approval does not include assessment against the siting
requirements of the Queensland Development Code. Should the approved
development require a siting variation against the Queensland Development Code,
an application for a Siting Variation must be submitted
for the approval of
Brisbane City Council – Development Services.
Note. This development approval does not commit to an approval of any
siting variation shown on the approved drawings.”; and
(iv) the following included as Condition 18:
(18) Standard Building Regulations
This approval does not include assessment against the siting
requirements of the Queensland Development Code. Should the approved
development require a siting variation against the Queensland Development Code,
an application for a Siting Variation must be submitted
for the approval of
Brisbane City Council – Development Services.
Note. This development approval does not commit to an approval of any
siting variation shown on the approved drawings.”

of the change representations made by the appellant was to seek to have the

contention and the essential facts as they have been set out above, are to be
understood in the following uncontentious context:
(a) the proposed development the subject of the application made to the
respondent is a relatively simple one, being for the erection
of a storage shed
on the land, noting that the application made included plans disclosing what was
proposed to be constructed and
the siting of it on the Land;
(b) upon its engagement as a private building certifier, the appellant is the
recognised assessment manager for the building work,
having regard to the code
assessable building assessment provisions in the
Building Act
(c) there are two functions attributed to the respondent:
(i) because of necessity of assessment of the proposal against the planning
scheme, in particular because of the proposed building
work within the
Biodiversity Overlay prescribed by the Brisbane City Council Plan 2014, the
respondent is the designated assessment
manager for that
assessment;
(ii) as a designated referral agency for the assessment of the building work

, because of the proposed siting of the
proposal within the minimum boundary setback prescribed by the Queensland
Development Code.
respondent seeks to revisit the reasoning in the earlier decisions in
Management Pty Ltd v Noosa Shire Council
and in any event, to distinguish
the factual circumstances here as to any applicability of that reasoning. The
essential contention
is that neither s 60(4) and more particularly s 54(3) of
, was engaged in the present circumstances, so that there is no
part refusal, such as to found the appeal and that it should be dismissed
that basis. Alternatively, it is contended that the appropriate outcome would be
to exercise the power in
s 47(1)(c)(ii)
Planning and Environment Court
, to set aside the decision and return the matter to the respondent
with any appropriate directions. Ultimately and if the appellant’s
contention as to the appropriate engagement of
established, it is conceded that such a return of the matter to the respondent
would be an appropriate outcome.
The challenge to the earlier reasoning
[8] Although
there were different reasons or triggers in respect of the engagement of the
Noosa Shire Council, as both assessment
manager and referral agency, (under a
different planning scheme) in the earlier
the development
application made in that instance was also lodged by the same building
certifier, in respect of the part demolition
and extension of a shed on a
property. In that instance, the Council was the assessment manager for that part
of the proposal which
involved demolition of part of the existing structure, and
it was otherwise a referral agency for the building development approval
involved, including in respect of the proposed extensions to the shed.
respondent Council unsuccessfully sought to strike out the appeal as
incompetent, including upon the basis that, as was ultimately
appellant’s position, it could not be premised in reliance upon
, because of the failure to include the Council’s referral
agency response as part of its approval. That issue required consideration
whether under the
, that Council was obliged to do so, having
particular regard to the application of
that instance, it was ultimately determined that the obligation to do so was
established and that the failure to include that
response constituted a failure
of the obligation of the assessment manager pursuant to
however, be noted that the reasoning as the prospect of such a conclusion, in
the context of reasoning as to the statutory
construction in support of such a
conclusion, was initially reached in the broader context of additional focus
upon other issues
as to the competency of the appeal and seeking to strike it
out, including as to the bringing of that appeal within the appropriate
limit and was necessarily, in that context, expressed in a preliminary sense.
However, the earlier reasoning was not the subject
of any revisitation in the
ultimate determination of that appeal.
[10] Accordingly,
that reasoning, as it pertained to the particular complications of the
application of
, is relied upon by the
appellant here. Whilst the respondent seeks to emphasise and rely upon what are
contended to be different
factual circumstances, as a means of demonstrating
that there is no valid appeal before the court, it also emphasises its
that the reasoning in the earlier decisions (“the Noosa
decisions”) should be revisited and a different conclusion reached.
contentions of the respondent are not persuasive as to any departure from what
was determined in the first Noosa decision,
as to the legislative construction
as to the applicability of
. In the course of
argument, the respondent identified the following from the first Noosa decision,
as the critical reasoning put
is also of importance to understand the effect of the appellant’s
contention, in reliance on
, that the provisions operate, if engaged, not
to substitute the referral agency as the assessment manager but to extend
obligations
otherwise held as assessment manager to include those which would
arise as the referral agency given a copy of the development application
required fee. And as has been central to this dispute from the outset and
pursuant to
, to dispense with the otherwise required referral agency
fee. In other words, it may be discerned that an effect of
, if engaged,
is to allow for the making of a singular development application to engage the
separate functions held by an assessment
manager which is also a referral
[44] It is convenient to note the position of the Council as to
being engaged. Effectively, the contention is that the severable parts of this
proposed development required separate submission
to the separately identified
assessment managers and so as to separately engage any respective referral
agency response and that
did not operate, in the circumstances, to
alleviate the need for separate provision of the part involving the building
development
work for assessment of the private certifier, to the Council as
referral agency together with the fee required pursuant to
Some particular emphasis is placed upon the understanding that a starting point
is that the legislative scheme expects
that a development application is made to
each assessment manager, from whom a decision or approval may be required. Such
of the legislative scheme has been generally examined earlier in these
reasons. However and as also earlier discussed, that does
not strictly mean
that there must be several and separate such applications, as opposed to a
necessity for a development application
which may be separately assessable, in
parts, to be given to each relevant assessment manager. Neither does any such
consideration
affect the fact that in respect of the development application
made to it here, the Council was an assessment manager.
[48] The construction of the phrase which is contended for the Council is not
to be accepted. Whilst the word “application”
is necessarily a
reference back to “the application” referred to in
turn “a development application” in respect of which “an
applicant ... must ... give a copy ... to each
referral agency”. For the
reasons already noted it is not necessary that in each respect in which there
may be several and
separate assessment managers for a development proposal, that
there is necessarily to be a separate or severable development application.
the contrary, the expressed provisions of
are in respect of
responsibility for relevantly “assessing all or part of an
application”. However, it may be seen that
as it provides that
the assessment manager is responsible for “administering and deciding the
application”, can only
sensibly require such administration and decision
to the extent that there is both power and obligation to do so. But as to the
of any such obligation pursuant to
, it is in respect of any
situation where the application, which is otherwise made to the assessment
manager, is that which would
otherwise be provided as a copy, to engage the
obligations as a referral agency as may be prescribed in
Schedules 9 and 10. Clearly
operates to
avoid any necessity for duplication of such notification and by
abrogates the requirement for any additional fee. Moreover, the obligation as to
engagement as a referral agency for “that
to be determined by the discrimen contained in Schedules 9 and 10. Relevantly
here, each of Tables
3 and 7, are identified as engaged for building work where
respectively identified circumstances relate to that building work.
[49] What may therefore be discerned is a coherent expectation of a single
and complete exercise of power and obligation in respect
of a development
application, here including those of the Council, as engaged pursuant to
in respect of that assessment to be undertaken as assessment manager and if
was also engaged in relation to any referral agency function in respect of
the building approval aspect, an expectation of inclusion
determination, in order to properly inform the decision to be made by the
private certifier.”
[12] In the
first instance, the challenge of the respondent to that reasoning largely
rehearses and seeks to refine, the essence of
the argument of the Council in the
first Noosa decision, particularly in focus upon the application of
being premised upon there being a single development application in issue.
Otherwise, the respondent’s submission sought to
characterise the
appellant’s proposed development here as necessarily involving two
development applications, as they were
required to be made to two different
assessment managers, requiring the application of separate assessment criteria
and separate
approvals or development permits, if granted. However, the
submissions expressly fell short of a contention that these considerations
the legislative scheme, necessitated conclusion that there must necessarily be
such separate development applications, at least
in the sense of the concession
of ability for an applicant to seek more than one required approval or permit in
a single application,
at least where the approvals are sought from the same
person or entity as the identified assessment
[13] Whilst the
passages in the first Noosa decision, to which particular attention is drawn,
must be read in the context of what
is more fully expressed in the reasons from
which they are drawn, they suffice to exemplify why there is no demonstrated
revisit the previous construction of the legislative scheme. Once it
is understood that the respondent’s position here is not
dissimilar to
what was observed to not be put in issue in the Noosa decision, that: “...
a particular development proposal
may combine a number of elements, which
constitute a desired outcome and may be the subject of a single development
application”,
the repeated
arguments of the respondent which tend to proceed upon an understanding that
because approvals must be sought and obtained
from more than one identified
assessment manager and pursuant to different assessment criteria, that
necessarily means that there
are multiple development applications for the
purpose of application of
are not to be
accepted. As was earlier noted, there is express recognition in
that an assessment manager may
have responsibility for
assessing only part of a development application.
[14] Moreover,
in such circumstances, neither is it demonstrated that an interpretation of
which seeks to limit the operation of that sub-section
by reference back to the terminology “applications of that type”
, is to any such effect, for the reasons earlier given for rejecting
such a contention.
Further that
contention is not materially improved by the particular reference, in this
matter, to a potential situation where it
may be discerned that a local
government as assessment manager may also be a referral agency in respect of the
same development approval
reference is to the effect of
Building Act
and Schedule
8, Table 2, Item 1 of the
Planning Regulation
, whereby, at the
choice of a development proponent, a relevant private certifier is not engaged
and the relevant local government
is designated as the assessment manager for
the assessment of the building development application under the
Building Act
That contention
proceeds upon the basis, which was not contradicted, that the local government
is also then relevantly designated
as a referral agency, having regard to the
application of s 22(1) and Schedule 9, Division 2, Table 1 of the
, being the same provisions identified as the basis of this
appeal and where there has been the engagement of a relevant private
[16] Both this
and a further contention additionally raised in this instance, appropriately and
necessarily, seek to engage consideration
of the interrelationship of the
Building Act
in the requirements for assessment of
building work, as a form of assessable development under the
“building work” is relevantly defined to
“(i) building, repairing, altering, underpinning
(whether by vertical or lateral support), moving or demolishing a building
other structure; or
(ii) works regulated under the building assessment provisions;”.
Further, the definition of “building assessment provisions” is
by way of express reference to
Building Act
. And it is
to be noted that, as has occurred in this instance by way of the engagement of
the respondent as the assessment manager
for issues arising under the relevant
planning scheme,
provides that any such:
“... planning instrument must not include a provision about building
work, to the extent the building work is regulated under
the building assessment
provisions, unless allowed under the
Building Act
Whilst the term “building work” is also defined in the
Building Act
that is materially and relevantly, in similar
terms to the
definition, as follows:
“(a) building, repairing, altering, underpinning (whether by vertical
or lateral support), moving or demolishing a building
or other structure; or
(d) other work regulated under the building assessment
provisions.
Building Act
“All building work is assessable development, unless the building work
is accepted development under
or a regulation made under the
Building Act
relevantly operates in reference to a
“building development application”, which is defined in
6 What is a
building development application
development application
(a) a development application for a development approval—
(i) if the local government is the assessment manager for the
application—to the extent the application is for building work
that, under
, must be assessed against the building assessment provisions; and
For the functions of a local government in relation to building
development applications, see
(ii) if a private certifier is the assessment manager for the
application—for building work; or
(b) a change application, other than a minor change application, to change a
development approval—
(i) if the development approval approves building work—in relation to the
building work; or
(ii) otherwise—to approve building work.
(2) However, if a local government is the responsible entity for a change
application, the application is a building development application
only to the
extent the building work mentioned in subsection (1)(b)(i) or (ii) must,
, be assessed against the building assessment provisions.
[17] An effect
of this definition and particularly as it is engaged in
of that Act, is to
separately identify those functions, as may be performed by a chosen private
certifier, which may be in respect
of the assessment and approval of proposed
building work against the building assessment provisions in
Building Act
, from other functions which may be performed by a
building certifier.
particular identification of such an application “to the extent the
application is for building work that, under the
, must be assessed against the building assessment provisions”, is
entirely consistent with the prior recognition of the express
, in recognition that an assessment manager may be responsible
for assessing all or part of a development application. Accordingly,
definition operates in focus upon the particular nature of the function to be
performed in respect of an approval which is sought,
as opposed to dictating any
necessity for any separate form of application.
[18] In those
circumstances there is no warrant for the narrow approach contended for the
respondent as to further limitation of those
instances where there may be a
referral agency function relating to the assessment of a building development
application, as that
may be regarded as a part of a development application for
building work, whether made to a private certifier or to a local government.
the previous reasoning demonstrates there is no discernible reason for further
limitation of the operation of
and what was then determined as the
harmonious operation of
to what is recognised
in the relevant extrinsic materials as to the limited situations where there may
be different assessment managers
(in the sense of different persons or entities)
for parts of a development proposal, specifically noted to include the
circumstances
of engagement of a relevant private
[19] It is only
further necessary to deal with another additional consideration to those raised
and dealt with in the earlier decisions,
as raised in this instance by the
respondent’s reference to the provisions of
Building Act
as a contextual consideration
to the interpretation of
. Such a sense of interrelationship may be observed in the
reference which is first made to the effect of
, in precluding, by
prescription of an offence, a private certifier from giving a building
development approval until all necessary
development permits under the
are in effect and all referral agency responses have been received or the
response period has ended. The proscriptions which are set
out are preceded by
the following words:
“The private certifier must not grant the
building development approval applied for—"
Particular reference is then made to the following provision in
“(3) For the development assessment process under the
, the building development application is taken not to have been received
by the private certifier until the day the last or only
application or request
mentioned in subsection (2)(a) to (c) to be decided is decided.”
The contention, in reliance upon this provision, is:
“Here, the Second Development Application (including any referral
matters) pursuant to
Building Act 1975
(Qld) is treated as though
it has not been received until the First Development Application is decided.
That is material when one
considers the proper exercise of administrative power
as against the Appellant’s invitation to the Court to find that a decision
ought be made in respect of the second Development Application despite the
express legislative intention for that application to
be treated as not in
existence until the First Development Application is
[20] It must be
concluded that this contention is not established when the operation of
closely considered. It is first necessary to note that sub-section (3) is only
expressed to operate in respect of any “application
or request mentioned
in subsection (2)(a) to (c)” and that sub-section (2)
“(2) Subsection (3) applies if the private certifier
receives the application before a following application or request is
(a) if subsection (1)(a) applies to the application—a development
application for each development permit, or a PDA development
application for
each PDA development permit, mentioned in the subsection;
(b) if subsection (1)(b) applies to the application—a development
application for a preliminary approval or development permit
mentioned in the
subsection;
(ba) if subsection (1)(ba) applies to the application—a PDA development
application for a PDA development permit mentioned
in the subsection;
(c) if subsection (1)(e) applies to the application—an application under
Plumbing and Drainage Act 2018
for a permit mentioned in the
subsection.”
Accordingly, it is to be noted that the application of
is expressed
so as to not include any engagement of the further proscriptions which appear in
, as follows:
“(c) until the building assessment work for the application has been
carried out under the building assessment provisions; and
(d) if, under the
Planning Act
, a referral agency must assess the building work
against, or having regard to, a matter relating to the building
work—until—
(i) the referral agency has given its referral agency’s response to the
private certifier or, if the referral agency does not
give a response before the
end of the referral agency’s response period for the application, until
after the response period
has ended; and
(ii) if the referral agency is the local government—any security it has
required for the carrying out of the building work
has been given; and
(e) if proposed works relating to the development include installing or altering
on premises an on-site sewage facility under the
Plumbing and Drainage Act
—until a permit under that Act has been given for the installation
or alteration.”
therefore has no application in relation to obtaining any
required response of a referral agency, so as to enable the private certifier
“grant the building development approval applied for”. That
sub-section is a deeming provision and cannot change the
reality of any
application for building development approval having been made and sub-section
(2) only engages sub-section (3) on
the premise that the private certifier has
received the application.
[21] Otherwise,
it may be discerned that where there is necessity for the types of separate
assessment by another assessment manager
as noted in sub-section (2) and
is engaged, the practical effect is in postponement of the decision period
available to the private certifier for the decision on
the building development
application and which might otherwise be coterminous with the decision period
available to the other assessment
Such underlying purpose
of this provision may also be gleaned from some historical context. The present
Building Act
is the consequence of amendment
made, by complete replacement of the existing sub-sections (2) and (3) in
conjunction with the enactment
(Consequential) and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2016
It suffices
to otherwise note that the preceding equivalent provision was inserted, as
and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2006
with sub-section (3), as it
remained until the 2016 amendment (albeit that it had been renumbered as
sub-section (2)),
expressed as follows:
“(3) If the
private certifier receives the application before all other assessments for
permits and approvals mentioned in subsection
(1) are completed, for timings
under IDAS, the application is taken not to have been received until the day all
other assessments
under IDAS have been completed.”
Application to this case
[22] However,
there is, in the different factual circumstances of this matter, more resonance
to a point made by the respondent as
to there being no legislative necessity for
an applicant to make all applications for all the approvals or permits which may
be necessary
for a proposed development, contemporaneously or concurrently. And
it may be understood that there may be practical reasons as to
why the approvals
may be sought in a staged manner. Whether or not there is to be discerned any
lack of procedural or commercial
sense in not doing so in circumstances like
those in this matter,
whether it occurs in a combined or separate applications, it is necessary,
pursuant to
that the application must be made to the
respective assessment manager who is authorised to give the approval or permit
sought. Further and pursuant to
, it is that application for
particular approval(s) or permit(s) which must also be given to the referral
[23] Unlike the
position noted in the earlier
there is nothing in
the application and supporting materials which indicates that the application
made to the respondent in this
instance, includes that which is to be made to
the appellant as assessment manager and also given to the respondent as referral
It may be specifically noted that:
(a) whilst the application form specifically requested identification of
“the assessment manager(s) who will be assessing this
development
application”, the only recording is “Brisbane City Council”
(b) the “No” box is crossed in response to the specific question:
“Does this development application include any
building work aspects that
have any referral requirements?”
Otherwise, there is nothing in the accompanying or any subsequently provided
materials to indicate that this application included
the assessment of the
building work against the building assessment provisions, as opposed to seeking
the assessment in respect of
the additional planning issue.
[24] Nevertheless,
the appellant points to the earlier notification of its appointment as the
building certifier for the proposed
development, as being sufficient to notify
the respondent that its obligation as the referral agency in respect of the
building development application was engaged, under
, upon the lodgement of the other necessary approval for which the
respondent is the assessment manager.
obligation of the private certifier to give the notification of engagement
arises pursuant to
Building Act
, under pain of
exposure to penalty for any offence of non-compliance and as one of the
obligations provided in regulation of the
activities of private certifiers. Such
obligations arise completely separately to the performance of any functions in
the assessment of building development work or dealing with any
applications for the assessment of any such proposal. As may be noted,
respectively in
s 143(1)(a)
s 143A(1)(a)
, the requisite notification is
required for engagement “by a client to perform private certifying
functions for a building
or building assessment work”. There is also
nothing in the notification which was given to specifically note any engagement
to perform “building assessment work”.
[26] Accordingly,
the effect of the respondent’s alternative and primarily
submission should be
accepted. Whilst, as has been concluded, it was open to the appellant to make a
single development application
to include each of the parts of the proposed
development which required the assessment of different assessment managers and
it is necessary that the
application is discernible as such an application. The necessary conclusion is
that the application made
in this instance to the respondent was not so
discernible and therefore did not engage those provisions of the
the consequence that there is no discernible engagement of
and no basis for this appeal.
[27] Therefore,
in the circumstances this appeal has no discernible competent foundation and as
the respondent seeks, the appropriate
order is to dismiss
