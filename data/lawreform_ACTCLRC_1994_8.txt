OF RECOMMENDATIONS
In this report, the Community Law Reform Committee makes the following 182
recommendations for change.
Recommendation 1: The proposed
Residential Tenancies Act
should apply in
every case where people enter into an agreement for the rental of residential
premises. A tenancy agreement may
exist whether or not the agreement entitles
the tenant to exclusive possession of the premises. However the proposed Act
not apply to the following types of accommodation pending further report
by the Committee:
* ACT Housing Trust;
* boarders and lodgers;
* hotels and motels;
* community housing;
* student accommodation provided by educational institutions;
* caravan parks;
* retirement villages.
The proposed Act should not apply to:
* crisis accommodation;
* holiday accommodation;
* accommodation for aged and disabled persons which is regulated by
Commonwealth legislation.
The Committee further recommends that the Minister have a discretion to
exclude particular premises from the operation of the proposed
disallowable instrument.
Recommendation 5: The proposed Act should contain a presumption that where
two or more people share a tenancy, they do so as joint
Recommendation 13: the committee should consult further on the necessity for
and nature of legislation to provide appropriate protection
for residents of
facilities which provide personal care services for the aged or disabled and
which are not covered by commonwealth
legislation.
ecommendation 15: The proposed Act should apply to cooperative housing,
however, certain special exemptions as provided for in the
Residential
Tenancies Act
(SA), may be appropriate. The question of exemptions should be
determined after further consultation with cooperative associations
members/ residents.
.c.'Recommendation 16: The terms of the draft Standard Tenancy Agreement
should apply in every tenancy agreement, whether agreed
to by the parties, or
Recommendation 20: the proposed Act should provide that a tenancy agreement
shall commence on the earliest of the following dates:
- date of commencement nominated in the tenancy agreement;
- date on which both parties sign the tenancy agreement and obtain a copy of
the signed agreement;
- date on which the tenant occupies the premises;
- date on which the lessor first receives rent from the tenant.
* oblige the lessor to nominate an address or addresses for service in the
tenancy agreement.
* deem delivery of documents at the nominated address to be actual
communication with the lessor
* provide for the lessor to change the nominated address as required during
the tenancy.
Recommendation
29: The proposed Act should require the lessor to provide the tenant with a
copy of the fully executed tenancy agreement
within three weeks of the time
that the tenant signs and forwards the unexecuted agreement to the lessor for
signature, or as soon
as reasonably practicable thereafter.
Recommendation 34: the proposed Act should require the lessor to provide the
tenant with a copy of the body corporate rules or bylaws
at or before
commencement of a tenancy which is managed by a corporation under the
Titles Act 1970
* the granting, extension, transfer or renewal of a tenancy or subtenancy;
* vacating of premises;
* obtaining a key to the premises;
* information on the availability of tenancies.
The proposed
Residential Tenancies Act
should also prohibit any requirements
in association with the above that the applicant or tenant make any
improvements, alterations
or repairs of the premises.
* the deposit is no greater than the equivalent of one weeks rent under the
proposed tenancy agreement;
* the lessor may only receive and hold one single deposit for the one
property at any one time.
* the lessor promises on the basis of the deposit, to take the premises off
the rental market, for a specified period; the lessor
may let the premises to
the deposit provider during or at the end of the specified period if agreement
is reached;
* if the lessor does not decide to rent the premises to the applicant within
the specified holding period, the lessor shall return
the holding deposit in
full to the applicant;
* if the applicant decides to not proceed with the tenancy agreement, the
lessor may retain from the deposit any actual loss of rent
incurred by the
lessor as a result of the agreement requiring withdrawal of the premises from
the rental market (the maximum amount
that the lessor may retain shall
therefore be the equivalent of the amount of rent that the lessor would have
received during the
period in which the premises were withdrawn from the
market; if it is the case that the lessor would not have been able to rent the
premises in any event, then the lessor shall not be able to retain any money
from the deposit); the lessor shall refund the remainder
(if any) of the
holding deposit;
* if the parties do enter a tenancy agreement, the holding deposit shall
become part of the rent or bond;
* the lessor provides the applicant with a written receipt which states the
* the identity of the holder of the deposit (lessor or agent);
* the identity of the provider of the deposit;

other such supplies as made use of;
* the establishment cost of a new account for the supply of such services in
the name of the tenant and the fee for reconnection
of these services should
they be disconnected as a result of failure of the tenant to pay for the
services or other fault of the
The lessor should pay for all fixed costs and government charges including
land tax and property rates. If the lessor arranges for
the physical
installation of a supply or service such as electricity, gas or telephone
(whether required under the proposed Act or
for other reasons), the lessor
should pay for such installation.
Recommendation 39: the proposed Act should require the tenant to pay for the
cost of water consumed by the tenant; the lessor should
pay for the annual
administrative fee for the supply of water which is not related to the amount
of water consumed.
Recommendation 40: the proposed Act should require the lessor to read or
arrange for the reading of the meter at the commencement
of the tenancy and on
termination. The lessor shall give the tenant opportunity to verify the
reading of the meter.
If the lessor fails to read the meter at the commencement of the tenancy,
the tenant shall not be liable for consumption of water
until after the meter
is first read after commencement. If the lessor fails to read the meter on the
termination of the tenancy,
subject to the following, the tenant shall not be
liable for consumption of water after the last reading of the meter prior to
termination.
If the tenant does not inform the lessor of the date on which the tenant is
to vacate the premises, then the lessor shall read the
meter on becoming aware
that the tenant has vacated the premises. The tenant shall then be liable for
consumption of water up to
the time of this reading. In case of dispute ,the
proposed Act shall deem the lessor to become aware of the date of vacating the
premises at the time that a reasonable person would have become aware of the
date in the circumstances.
The proposed Act should also provide that any agreement for a third party to
act as surety for the tenant shall have the following
effect. The surety shall
be liable to pay compensation to the lessor for any loss suffered by the lessor
due to breach of the tenancy
by the tenant whether the breach occurred during
the fixed term or periodic tenancy, subject to the following. The liability of
the surety to pay compensation shall not extend beyond
* the maximum amount of money that the lessor could have required as a bond;
* liability to pay for those losses for which the lessor could have sought
deductions from a bond at the end of the tenancy had a
bond been paid.
Any terms of a contract of guarantee or contract of indemnity which conflict
with the above requirements shall be void to the extent
of the conflict. The
contract of guarantee or indemnity shall continue to operate if possible.
* The cost of repairs necessary as a result of damage to the premises caused
by the tenant (other than fair wear and tear);
* Loss of rent up to and including the date of termination of the tenancy or
abandonment of the premises;
* Loss of wood, gas or other fuel supplied by the lessor at the commencement
of the tenancy which the tenant has used and not replaced;
* Costs incurred for consumption by the tenant of a commodity such as water,
* the lessor is liable to the supply authority for payment;
* the tenant has not paid the lessor for the consumption costs.
The Committee also recommends that where a claim for compensation for any
breach of the tenancy agreement is upheld by the Tribunal,
the Tribunal should
have the power to authorise that money be taken from the bond and paid to the
lessor as compensation whatever
the subject matter of the claim.
* the lessor is not required to agree to lodgement by the tenant
* where the tenant is to lodge the bond, the tenant shall not be entitled to
possession of the premises until the lessor receives
evidence of lodgement of
the bond with the proposed Tenancy Office (Bond Office) unless the lessor
otherwise agrees;
* an original receipt from the Tenancy office shall constitute evidence of
lodgement by the tenant
* where the lessor receives the bond money from the tenant, the current
rules and procedures shall apply to the lessor.
Recommendation 55: The proposed
Residential Tenancies Act
should provide for
payment of rent at a nominated address, by deposit into a nominated bank
account or in person as agreed.
Recommendation 56: The proposed
Residential Tenancies Act
should continue to
require the lessor to:
* keep records of rent and bond payments; and
* require the lessor to make these records available for inspection by the
tenant within 14 days of the request.
* require the lessor or agent to provide a receipt for payment of rent or
bond to the tenant except where the rent is paid by direct
deposit into a bank
account nominated by the lessor or agent;
* require the lessor or agent to issue a receipt immediately in cases where

* the date of payment;
* the amount paid;
* the period in respect of which the payment is made;
* the premises in respect of which payment is made; and
* whether payment is of bond money or rent.
`Recommendation 61: The 12 month restriction should continue to apply to
particular rented premises provided that the identity of
one or more of the
tenants of the premises remains the same as at the time of the last rent
* the proposed Act should presume a rent increase is excessive if it is 20%
greater than, the increase for the corresponding period
in the ABS Consumer
Price Index for rents in Canberra; and
* the ACT Government should make this ABS data available to the Residential
Tenancies Tribunal and all tenancy organisations

considers is not excessive;
* disallow the rent increase and reaffirm the original rent; or
* where appropriate order repayment by the lessor to the tenant of rent paid
as a result of a disallowed rent increase.
If the tribunal allows the rent increase or substitutes a new rent increase
for the one sought by the lessor the rent increase must
be backdated to the
date at which the increase was to have taken effect in accordance with the
notice of the lessor. The 12 month
restriction should then apply from this
date. If the tribunal disallows the rent increase the 12 month restriction
should also apply
from the date at which the increase was to have taken effect
in accordance with the notice of the lessor.
* a tenant who wishes to apply to the tribunal to dispute the increase to
give the lessor written notice of application to the tribunal
and make that
application at least 14 days before the rent increase was to have taken effect
according to the lessor's notice; and
* a tenant who wishes to vacate the premises as a result of the rent
increase to give written notice of intention to vacate at least
14 days before
the rent increase was to have taken effect.
If the tenant does not give either of the above notices to the lessor within
the required period then the proposed Act should deem
the tenant to have
accepted the rent increase. The tenant should be able to apply to the tribunal
for an extension of the above
notice periods in special circumstances such as
the tenant being on holidays at the time of the notice of the rent
The Committee also recommends that the government amend the Discrimination

the premises except in accordance with the tenancy agreement and the proposed
Recommendation 79: the proposed Act should give the Tribunal power to order
a reduction in the rent for interference by the lessor
in the tenant's use and
enjoyment of the premises. The Tribunal should be able to order a
retrospective reduction in rent to continue
until the cessation of
interference. The Tribunal should be able to deem separate acts of
interference as continuing interference
by the lessor as it considers
appropriate and order a reduction in rent accordingly.

Recommendation 138: If a co-tenant dies then the tenancy shall continue
with the surviving co-tenant(s) as the sole tenants. This

Application of occupants to be declared tenants, or application of surviving
co-tenant(s) for early termination of the tenancy, shall
have priority over any
claim of the estate of the deceased tenant. Subject to this requirement, the
estate of the deceased shall
acquire the tenancy of the deceased in accordance
with the general law. If the estate does acquire the tenancy, the estate shall
have the option of terminating the tenancy without liability to the lessor for
doing so. The estate may terminate the tenancy by

and notice of intention to vacate to be in writing and
require the tenant to
sign the notice of intention to vacate and require the lessor or the real
estate agent of the lessor nominated
in the tenancy agreement to sign the
notice to vacate.
The proposed Act should contain as a schedule to the Act, a standard form
for a notice to vacate and notice of intention to vacate;
the standard form
should be developed by the Consumer Affairs Bureau in consultation with tenancy
agencies; the Act should require
the lessor or tenant to use the standard form
or use a written notice which closely resembles the standard form in content
and appearance.
Recommendation 140: The proposed Act should require the notice to vacate
and the notice of intention to vacate to contain the following
information:
- if a ground is required under the proposed Act, the ground(s) on which the
notice is served and the circumstances giving rise to
the ground(s);
- the address of the premises subject to the notice;
- in the case of a notice to vacate:
the lessor requires the tenant to vacate the premises by date [x] which
date falls after the expiry of the required notice period
and that the tenancy
shall terminate on the day that the tenant vacates the premises;
- in the case of a notice of intention to vacate:
the tenant intends to vacate the premises on date [x] which date falls
after the expiry of the required notice period and the tenancy
shall terminate
on that day.
Recommendation 141: The proposed Act should provide that a tenant who
intends to vacate the premises in response to a notice to vacate
lessor, may
vacate the premises on the day nominated in the notice to vacate as the day
on which the lessor requires vacant possession of the
premises (hereafter the
nominated date); or
vacate the premises on any day during the two week period prior to the
nominated date provided the tenant first gives the lessor
four days notice
(verbal notice shall be sufficient) of the day on which the tenant intends to
vacate the premises.
In either of the above two cases, the tenancy shall end on the day that the
tenant vacates the premises. If the tenant does not give
the lessor four days
notice of intention to vacate the premises on a date prior to the nominated
date, then the proposed Act shall
deem the tenancy to continue until the
nominated date irrespective of the day on which the tenant vacates the
In the case of a notice of intention to vacate, the tenancy shall terminate
on the date nominated in the notice as the date on which
the tenant intends to
vacate the premises.
Recommendation 143: The proposed Act should provide that notices or other
documents required under the Act may be delivered:
- in person by hand;
- by Australia Post;
- by fax; or
- by registered courier
Recommendation 144: The proposed Act should provide that it is not possible
to withdraw a notice to vacate or notice of intention
to vacate once the notice
is served except with the agreement of the person who is the subject of the
If the tenant serves a notice of intention to vacate on the lessor and the
tenant fails to vacate the premises in accordance with
the notice, the lessor
should be able to apply to the tribunal for termination and possession orders.
The proposed
Residential Tenancies Act
should require a lessor who wishes to
make such an application, to do so within four weeks of the termination date
nominated in the
notice of intention to vacate. If the Tribunal decides that
the lessor and tenant did agree to terminate the tenancy, the Tribunal
terminate the tenancy and order that the lessor have possession of the
Recommendation 145: The proposed Act should require the tenant to provide
the lessor with a contact address at or before vacating
the premises which the
lessor can use to contact the tenant after termination of the tenancy.
If the notice is defective and the defect is not remedied by tribunal order,
the notice to vacate, notice of intention to vacate shall
have no effect and
the lessor or tenant should be able to claim compensation for abandonment of
premises or wrongful eviction respectively.
The tenant should be able to seek
orders to allow the tenant to resume occupation of the premises.
Recommendation 147: The proposed Act should provide as follows:
If the lessor seeks and obtains termination of the tenancy through
deliberate use of false or misleading information in a notice to
through presentation of false or misleading evidence at a Tribunal hearing, the
tenant may apply for compensation for wrongful
eviction and orders to allow the
tenant to resume occupation of the premises.
If the tenant seeks and obtains termination of the tenancy through
deliberate use of false or misleading information in a notice of
intention to
vacate or through presentation of false or misleading evidence at a Tribunal
hearing, the lessor may apply for compensation
on the basis that the tenant has
abandoned the premises.
* the lessor may terminate the tenancy by giving eight weeks notice to
vacate to the tenant on the grounds that the lessor is required
to move in to
the premises due to a work transfer from outside the Canberra/Queanbeyan
region; and
* the tenant may terminate the tenancy by giving eight weeks notice of
intention to vacate to the lessor on the grounds that the tenant
is required to
vacate the premises due to a work transfer outside the Canberra/Queanbeyan
Recommendation 150: The Committee recommends that the proposed Act and
standard tenancy agreement provide for the lessor to terminate
the tenancy on
any of the following grounds in addition to breach of the tenancy agreement;
* the lessor or the lessor's immediate relative intends to reside in the
premises; the lessor must give the tenant four weeks notice
in writing to
vacate the premises;
* a person (other than immediate relative) who:
* has a close family or personal relationship with the lessor and therefore
a reasonable expectation that the lessor will assist the
person to find
accommodation
* intends to reside in the premises and the lessor has obtained the approval
of the tribunal for termination on this ground at a hearing
of which the tenant
had adequate notice; four weeks notice required;
* the lessor has a bona fide intention to sell the premises; eight weeks
notice required; and
* the lessor has a bona fide intention to reconstruct, make major repairs or
renovations which cannot reasonably be carried out while
the tenant is in
occupation of the premises; twelve weeks notice required.;
* the lessor granted the tenancy as part of a contract of employment between
the lessor and tenant, the tenant ceases to be an employee
of the lessor and
the lessor requires the premises for the accommodation of another employee;
four weeks notice required.
The proposed Act and standard tenancy agreement should also provide for the
lessor to terminate the tenancy after expiry of the fixed
term in the absence
of any of the above grounds provided the lessor gives the tenant 26 weeks
notice to vacate.
* if the tenant then fails to remedy the breach the lessor can serve a
notice to vacate in writing on the tenant requiring the tenant
to vacate within
fourteen days; and
* if the tenant then fails to vacate then the lessor can apply to the
tribunal for an order for termination of the tenancy and eviction
* If the tenant breaches the same term of the tenancy agreement on three
occasions then on the third occasion, the lessor should not
be required to give
the tenant an opportunity to remedy the breach.
* In this case after the third breach the lessor should be able to serve the
written notice requiring the tenant to vacate within
fourteen days; and if the
tenant does not vacate, apply to the tribunal for termination of the tenancy.
* serious damage to the residential premises; or
* injury to the lessor, the lessor's agent or any person in occupation of or
permitted on adjoining or adjacent premises
* the lessor gives the tenant two weeks written opportunity to remedy the
breach; and at the same time gives each of the new residents
a copy of the
notice for information;
* if the two week period of opportunity to remedy expires, and there is no
agreement for the new residents to vacate then the lessor
can give the tenant
and each of the new residents a separate written notice to vacate within 2
* the tenant and the new residents can then vacate or continue to reside in
the premises until the matter is decided by the tribunal;
if the tenant and/or
the new residents do not vacate the premises then the lessor can apply to the
tribunal for termination of the
* at the termination hearing the tribunal should have the discretion
u grant the termination application and require all residents to vacate the
u refuse termination on the grounds that the lessor did consent to the
assignment or subletting and confirm all residents as tenants
or subtenants;
u refuse termination on the grounds that the new residents agree to vacate
the premises
u order that the tenancy be terminated but postpone the time of termination
for a limited period on the grounds of hardship to the
tenant; and allow the
new residents to remain in occupation of the premises until the time of
termination.
* the lessor can seek termination of a tenancy for non payment of rent only
on the basis that an amount of rent is owing and has not
been paid for seven
clear calendar days ; in this calculation the first day expires at midnight on
the day on which the rent was
due and not paid;
* the lessor may then serve a notice to remedy the failure to pay rent on
the eighth day the rent has been unpaid; the notice to remedy
must clearly
state that the tenant may negate the effect of the notice by paying the rent
arrears at any time during the notice period;
the remedy period shall be a
further seven days
* once the notice to remedy has been served the tenant may negate the effect
of the notice by paying the full amount of the rent owing.
The tenant must do
this within seven days of receiving the notice; if the tenant does pay the rent
in arrears within this seven
day period, the tenancy continues and the lessor
can no longer use the failure as a ground to terminate the tenancy agreement;
* if the tenant fails to pay the rent as required by the notice to remedy,
the lessor may then serve a notice to vacate on the tenant
requiring the tenant
to vacate the premises within fourteen days, the lessor may apply, at the same
time, to the Tribunal for a termination
* the Tribunal may list the matter for hearing at any time after the expiry
of the above 14 day notice to vacate period; the registrar
of the tribunal must
give the tenant one weeks notice in writing of the tribunal hearing; and
* if the tenant does not vacate the premises, the hearing takes place as
* the proposed Act should require the tribunal to hear applications for
termination for non payment of rent as soon as practicable
after the expiry of
the two week notice to vacate period.
If the tenant fails to pay rent for more than seven days on a third
occasion, the lessor may serve a notice to vacate on the tenant
after the rent
has been unpaid and owing for seven clear days; there should be no requirement
to serve a notice to remedy; in all
other respects the procedures should be as
recommended above.
Recommendation 156: The Tribunal shall have a discretion to postpone the
operation of orders for termination and possession in favour
of the lessor,
for up to 21 days on the basis of relative hardship, that is, on the basis that
the tenant would suffer greater hardship
if the tribunal refused to postpone
termination, than the lessor would suffer if the tribunal did postpone
termination.
Recommendation 157: The proposed Act should provide that the Tribunal shall
make termination and possession orders on the application
of the lessor if it
is satisfied that:
* the tenant did breach a term of the tenancy;
* the owner served a notice of termination on the grounds of the breach in
accordance with the Standard Agreement;
* the tenant did not vacate the premises as required by the notice;
* the breach is in the circumstances such as to justify termination of the
unless the tenant satisfies the tribunal that it should make one of the
following alternative orders. The Tribunal may:
* refuse to terminate the tenancy on the basis that the tenant has remedied
the breach, if it considers it appropriate and just to
do so in the
circumstances;
* refuse to terminate the tenancy on the basis that the tenant is reasonably
likely to be able to and undertakes to remedy the breach
within a reasonable
period, if the tribunal considers it appropriate and just to do so in the
circumstances;
* order that the tenancy terminate and the owner have possession of the
premises but postpone the operation of these orders, for
up to 21 days on the
basis of relative hardship, that is, on the basis on the basis that the tenant
would suffer greater hardship
if the tribunal refused to postpone termination,
than the lessor would suffer if the tribunal did postpone termination.
If the tenant can establish to the satisfaction of the tribunal that he or
she is reasonably likely to be able to repay the rent owing
and the ongoing
rent and undertakes to do so, then the tribunal may refuse termination but only
on the condition that the tenant
pay the rent owing within a fixed period and
in a manner to be determined by the tribunal.
* the lessor need not apply to the tribunal for a termination order;
* the tenancy should terminate and the lessor should be entitled to
possession of the premises at 5.00 pm the day after the day on
which the rent
was due and not met;
* all rent owing at this time shall fall due;
* if necessary the lessor may apply to the registrar for authorisation of
* the tenant had applied to the tribunal for an order;
* the tenant had applied to a governmental authority to secure or enforce
his or her rights as a tenant; or
* an order of the tribunal was in force in relation to the lessor and the
In this situation, the onus of proof should be on the lessor to show that
the termination was not so motivated.
* the tenancy shall terminate on a particular day [to be determined by the
tribunal] and the tenant is required to vacate the premises
on or before that
* if the tenant does not vacate the premises as required then a warrant
shall issue for the eviction of the tenant;
* the registrar shall execute this warrant upon the lessor proving to the
satisfaction of the registrar that the tenant has not vacated
the premises as
* the warrant must be executed by the registrar and the eviction must take
place within a certain number of days [this number to be
determined by the
tribunal]; if the eviction does not take place within this period the warrant
lapses and the tenancy shall be deemed
to revive and continue;
* the police shall give the tenant at least two days notice of the eviction
[the tribunal may vary this requirement where appropriate
circumstances].
The proposed
Residential Tenancies Act
should require that an eviction may
not take place in the absence of the Australian Federal Police.
* the lessor may apply to the registrar for execution of a warrant for the
eviction of the tenant;
* if the registrar is satisfied that:
u the tenant has not paid the rent by the due date and time as required by
the tribunal; and
u the tenancy has subsequently terminated pursuant to the order of the
* the registrar may execute a warrant for the eviction of the tenant;
* the registrar must provide for the tenant to receive notice of the pending
eviction at least two clear working days before the police
evict the tenant;
* upon receiving notice of pending eviction, the tenant may dispute the
eviction but only on the basis that the tenant has in fact
paid the rent as
required by the tribunal;
* if the tenant wishes to dispute the eviction then the tenant must notify
the registrar of the dispute within two days of receiving
the notice of pending
* if the tenant notifies the registrar of a dispute the registrar must list
the matter for urgent hearing by the tribunal and the
warrant is suspended
until the tribunal makes its decision; and
* if there is no notification of dispute the eviction takes place in
accordance with the order of the tribunal.
Recommendation 163: The proposed Act should provide for the lessor to obtain
compensation for failure of the tenant to vacate the
premises as required by
Tribunal order. The lessor should be able to claim compensation for:
* financial loss incurred as a direct result of being unable to take vacant
possession of the premises from the date on which the
Tribunal required the
tenant to vacate the premises, to the date on which the tenant does actually
vacate the premises; and
* the cost to the lessor of application to the registrar and other
procedures to evict the tenant.
Recommendation 164: The tenant should be able to apply to the tribunal for
early termination on the grounds of hardship. The tribunal
should be able to
agree to terminate the tenancy on the grounds of hardship such that it is
appropriate and just that the tenancy
be terminated. If the tribunal agrees to
terminate the tenancy for these grounds the lessor should have a minimum of 8
weeks notice
of the termination as from the date of application by the tenant
to the Tribunal for early termination. In this circumstance no
compensation
should be payable by the tenant to the lessor for the early termination. The
tenant may seek a reduction of this 8
week period on the grounds of severe
hardship. The tribunal may reduce the period after consideration of the
hardship to the tenant
if the period were not reduced and of the hardship to
the lessor if it were reduced.
Recommendation 165: The proposed Act should provide for the tenant to
terminate a:
* fixed term tenancy agreement:
on any grounds, on the day the fixed
term expires, by giving the lessor a minimum of three weeks written notice of
intention to vacate;
the notice of intention to vacate should be substantially
in the standard form and state that the tenant intends to vacate the premises
on the day the fixed term expires; the tenancy agreement should then come to an
end on that day; and
* periodic tenancy:
on any grounds by giving the lessor three weeks
written notice of intention to vacate; the notice of intention to vacate should
substantially in the standard form and state that the tenant intends to
vacate the premises on the date specified in the notice;
the tenancy agreement
should then come to an end on that day; the common law rules as to the method
and timing of notice for termination
of periodic tenancies should not apply.
'Recommendation 167: Where the lessor breaches the tenancy agreement the
Residential Tenancies Act
should require the tenant to seek
termination of the tenancy in the following manner.
* if the lessor breaches the tenancy agreement and the breach is capable of
remedy, the tenant should give the lessor 14 days written
notice of opportunity
* if the lessor fails to remedy the breach within the 14 day notice period
or the breach is incapable of remedy, then the tenant may
give the lessor 14
days notice of intention to vacate;
* the tenancy agreement comes to an end on the day the tenant vacates the
premises in accordance with the notice of intention to vacate;
the tenant owes
rent only up to and including the day that the tenant vacates the premises;
* if the lessor remedies the breach after the opportunity to remedy period
but during the notice of intention to vacate period the
tenant may at his or
her option still bring the tenancy to an end by vacating the premises on the
nominated date.
* serious damage to the tenant's property; or
* injury to the tenant or a member of the tenant's family.
* the lessor can only enter and regain possession of the premises if the
lessor has a reasonable and genuine belief that the premises
are abandoned;
* the standard information booklet should make it clear that a simple breach
of the agreement does not amount to abandonment and that
there must be clear
evidence of abandonment before the lessor can repossess the premises;
* if the lessor repossesses the premises and the tenant has not in fact
abandoned the premises, then, except as provided below, the
lessor should be
liable to pay compensation to the tenant for the costs arising directly out of
the eviction; however if the tenant
owes the lessor rent then in this
circumstance the lessor shall not be liable to pay compensation for costs
arising directly from
the repossession of the property;
* the question of whether the tenant has abandoned the premises should be
decided on an objective analysis of all the circumstances,
with the onus of
proof resting on the lessor;
* the lessor may obtain a declaration from the tribunal that the premises
have been abandoned. If the tribunal does declare the premises
abandoned then
the tenancy agreement should come to an end on the day that the tribunal
declares the premises to be abandoned and
the lessor should be entitled to
repossess the premises and should not be liable to pay compensation to the
tenant for doing so.
If in this case the tenant does claim compensation for
wrongful eviction then the compensation claim, if successful, should be paid
for out of Government funds.
The above maximum amount shall apply before any consideration of reduction
of compensation in accordance with the duty to mitigate.
For example, if the
tribunal decides that the compensation should be reduced because of failure to
mitigate, and there were 45 weeks
remaining in the fixed term after the
abandonment, the tribunal shall apply the reduction as though there were 16
weeks rather than
45 weeks remaining. The maximum should not affect
calculations of compensation or reduction for failure to mitigate, where the
abandons the premises with 16 or less weeks remaining in the tenancy.
* the advertising costs and reletting costs are reasonable;
* the compensation should be reduced by reason of the timing of the
abandonment given that the lessor is likely to incur these costs
at the end of
the fixed term in any event.
Recommendation 174: There should be legislation to establish clear and fair
principles for dealing with abandoned goods. The legislation
should provide
for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction to decide claims concerning property
abandoned by the tenant and the legislation
should be generally consistent with
the following requirements:
* The lessor may remove, destroy or dispose of abandoned foodstuffs or other
perishable goods immediately ;
* the lessor must store goods the value of which is less than the total
estimated cost of removal, storage and sale for a short period
perhaps one
* the lessor must store personal goods including private or personal
documents, official records, bankbooks, certificates, photographs
and similar
items for an extended period in the order of 12 weeks; if they are not claimed
the lessor may dispose of them;
* In dealing with goods other than the above, the lessor must
* store the goods in a safe place for a significant period in the order of 6
* Lessor must forward a notice to the tenant of the abandoned goods if the
tenant leaves a forwarding address; the notice should state
that lessor shall
sell the goods unless the tenant claims them;
* The tenant may claim the goods at any time before sale. The lessor must
(except as provided for below) return the goods provided
that the tenant pays
for the reasonable costs of removal and storage.
* The lessor may withhold the goods for reasons that the tenant has breached
the tenancy and owes the lessor compensation; however,
if the lessor does so he
or she must apply within three days to the tribunal for an order for
compensation and an order allowing
the lessor to retain the goods until
compensation is paid; if no application is made within three days of the tenant
first claiming
the goods the lessor must return them to the tenant;
* If the tenant does not claim the goods, the lessor may then sell them in
accordance with the legislation and deduct from the proceeds
the costs of
removal, storage and sale.
* the lessor may apply to the tribunal for approval to retain some of the
proceeds of sale to pay for money owing by the tenant for
breach of the
* Money remaining after deductions should be deposited with the tenancy
tribunal for it to retain for 12 months and refund to the
tenant if claimed. If
the money is not claimed then, after 12 months, the tribunal should forward the
money to the Government for
incorporation into general revenue.
The Committee further recommends that:
* the lessor should be able to apply to the tribunal for a declaration as to
the status of the goods and the appropriate means of
disposal; if the sale of
the goods does not meet the cost of storage, removal and sale, as predicted by
the tribunal, the lessor
should bear this loss;
* the lessor should not be liable to a claim of a tenant with respect to the
abandoned goods where he or she disposes of the goods
according to these
provisions; disposal of the goods in accordance with a decision of the tribunal
should be conclusive evidence
that the lessor has so disposed of the goods;
* The lessor should not be liable to a person other than the former tenant
for disposal of the goods under these provisions except
where the lessor had
actual knowledge of the person's interest and failed to take reasonable steps
to notify that person of the property
and pending sale;
* A purchaser of the goods at a sale provided for above should acquire full
legal title to the goods unless the purchaser had actual
knowledge that a
person other than the former tenant owned the property.
* non compliance of the Tribunal order or orders (other than an order for
payment of money) without reasonable excuse where
u the person has failed to comply with a tribunal order on one or more
previous occasion(s) in the 12 months preceding the act of
non compliance;
u the previous occasion(s) of non compliance have been the subject of a
tribunal order for civil penalty;
* serious misbehaviour at or disturbance of Tribunal proceedings
* to knowingly provide information in any notice or document required under
the proposed
Residential Tenancies Act
, that is false or misleading in any
material particular.
The Tribunal should not hear prosecutions for offences under the Act and
should not have the power to convict or jail people. Prosecutions
for criminal
offences shall take place in the Magistrates Court.
The manager of the Tenancy Office shall refer matters as appropriate to the
DPP for possible prosecution; in much the same way that
the director of
Consumer Affairs refers matters to the DPP for prosecution. Private individuals
may notify the Tenancy Office or
the AFP of offences for possible referral to
the DPP. The Tribunal shall not refer matters for possible prosecution.
* eviction without order of the Tribunal
* failure to lodge a bond
* non compliance with tribunal order or orders (other than orders for
payment of money);
There should be three means for initiating proceedings for a civil penalty
as follows:
the aggrieved party (applicant) should be able to apply to the Tribunal for
a civil penalty to be imposed as well as compensation;
the manager of the Tenancy Office should be able to initiate proceedings
independently of the applicant; and
the Tribunal should be able to impose a civil penalty on its own
On receiving an application for civil penalty:
* the registrar of the Tribunal should give at least two weeks notice to all
parties; the notice to the person who has allegedly disobeyed
the initial order
of the Tribunal should note the consequences of non-compliance and should
provide that if the order is complied
with prior to the Tribunal hearing then
proceedings for a civil penalty will cease;
* if, after hearing both parties, the Tribunal decides that, on the balance
of probabilities, there exist grounds to impose a civil
penalty, the Tribunal
should have the discretion to do one or more of the following:
u order appropriate compensation be paid to the applicant and make no
further order;
u impose a civil penalty to a maximum value of $5000 and no further order;
u impose a civil penalty to a maximum value of $5000 and order the
respondent to pay the applicant appropriate compensation
If the Tribunal imposes a civil penalty, the registrar or the aggrieved
party should then be able to seek payment of the civil penalty
through the
Magistrates Court as though it were a civil judgement debt of that Court.
The proceeds of the civil penalty should be paid into the proposed trust
fund of the Tenancy Office, that is, the fund developed through
interest earned
on bond monies currently held by the Bond Office.
Recommendation 177: The proposed Act should provide for the Tribunal to
award compensation up to the value of $20 000.
Recommendation 181: The proposed Act should provide for the Tribunal to
have the power to award compensation to the tenant for the
direct financial
cost to the tenant for wrongful eviction. The Tribunal should also have the
power to require the lessor to allow
the wrongfully evicted tenant to reoccupy
the premises as tenant if the Tribunal considers this action is appropriate in
the circumstances.
