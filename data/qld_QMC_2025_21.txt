Introduction
[1] The plaintiff brings suit seeking to recover fees from the
defendant totalling $25,302.89.
[2] The plaintiff has requested default
judgment from the Registrar in that
[3] The court, as constituted by a
Registrar, may give default judgment on a debt or liquidated
The Registrar may assess, in respect of
a request for default judgment, the amount of any interest claimed and costs for

Registrar’s Referral
[4] The Registrar has referred to the Court,
pursuant to r.982(1) of the UCPR ,the question of what costs are recoverable by
the plaintiff.
[5] The plaintiff is a self-acting law firm and claims in
addition to filing fees and process server fees its’ professional
[6] The plaintiff was invited to make submissions about the issue that
was referred to the court and those submissions were contained
in a brief email.
[7] It is convenient to set out the entirety of the plaintiff’s
submissions in this regard which was in these terms “our
office has sought
reimbursement of our professional time by way of compensation for the further
resources inputted in recovering
the debt, time and resources which could have
been applied in other areas of the firm. The purpose of seeking costs was not to
the defendant but to compensate the plaintiff for use of professional
resources for recovering a debt that ought to have been paid”.
general rule a self-represented litigant may not obtain any recompense for the
value of his or her time spent in
litigation.
[9] In England v Wales an
exception to the general rule was that a self-represented litigant who happens
to be a solicitor may recover
his or her professional costs for acting in the
litigation.
This is the so-called Chorley
[10] The High Court in Bell Lawyers Pty Ltd v Janet Pentelow &
found conclusively against that
proposition notwithstanding that it had been previously applied by some
Australian Courts.
[11] The High Court said:
“dealing with the
matter more broadly, however, the Chorley exception is not only anomalous, it is
an affront to the fundamental
value of equality of all persons before the law.
It cannot be justified by the considerations of policy said to support it.
Accordingly
it should not be recognised as part of the common law of
Australia”.
[12] The Court went on to
consider the issue of in-house lawyers and said:
“a decision by this
court that the Chorley exception is not part of the common law of Australia
would not disturb the well established
understanding in relation to in-house
lawyers employed by governments and others, that where a solicitor appears in
proceedings to
represent his or her employer, the employer is entitled to
recover costs in circumstances where an ordinary party would be so entitled
way of indemnity”.
The plaintiff
here would appear to be an incorporated legal practice having sued as - Stockley
Pagano Lawyers Pty Ltd.
[13] In Bell Lawyers Pty Ltd the High Court
considered the proposition, of an Incorporated Law firm , but was not required
not reach a concluded view.
[14] The Court said:
the same view should be taken in relation to a solicitor employed by an
incorporated legal practice of which he or
she is a sole director or
shareholders stands to a different position.”
subsequently:
“it is sufficient for present purposes to say whether or
not an incorporated legal practice that is a vehicle for a sole practitioner
should be able to obtain an order for costs for work performed by sole director
or shareholder is ultimately a matter for the
legislature”.
[15] The plaintiff has
been invited to provide submissions on the issue, which would have been
anticipated to address the law and
facts but has failed to do so. Having regard
to the facts, as understood including the Plaintiffs structure ,and following
the principles
found in Bell Lawyers Case , the plaintiff as a self-represented
litigant law firm ought not recover its professional costs.
determine, in respect of the Registrar’s referral, that the professional
costs sought by the plaintiff be disallowed.
