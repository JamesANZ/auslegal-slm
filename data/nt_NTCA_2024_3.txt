REASONS FOR JUDGMENT ON COSTS
(Delivered 16 August 2024)
September 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its decision on the preliminary
issue of which party bore liability for damages
for breach of a contract for the
sale of chattels
(‘Contract’).
held that the purchaser (defendant/appellant) is liable to the vendor
(plaintiffs/respondents) for the wrongful repudiation
of the Contract of Sale,
with damages to be assessed.
defendant/appellant appealed from that decision. On 16 August 2021, this Court
delivered its decision on the appeal from the
decision of the Supreme
[3] The appeal
was dismissed, save for grounds 19 and 20, upholding the trial Judge’s
conclusion about the purchaser’s/appellant’s
liability for damages.
The appeal was allowed in respect of grounds 19 and 20, with a declaration that
the term ‘Ex WDR Plant
& Equipment’ as used in the Contract of
Sale included the drilling rig.
assessment of damages trial has been heard by the Supreme Court and judgment is
[5] The parties
now seek orders for costs in respect of the appeal and the liability
Costs of the appeal
respondents seek an order that the appellant pay 90% of the respondents’
costs of the appeal on the basis that the respondents
succeeded in the appeal on
the major issue regarding repudiation of the Contract and liability for damages,
and failed on the minor
issue regarding whether the drilling rig was included in
the Contract, and it was the major issue which occupied the vast majority
Court’s time in the hearing of the appeal and the parties’ time and
expense in the conduct of the appeal.
appellant seeks an order that each party pay their own costs of the appeal on
the basis that, of the two issues on the appeal,
being which party bore the risk
of claims by third parties under the Contract and whether the drilling rig was
included in the Contract,
success (and failure) were shared equally. It is said
that the Court cannot assess which issue has greater significance for the
outcome of the proceedings, and the Court cannot make allowance for the
fact that greater time was spent on the former issue than
the latter.
appellant argued that the respondents may not be entitled to any more than
nominal damages because the proceeds of sales of
the chattels to third parties
potentially exceed the Contract price, and because the value of the drilling
rig, retained by the respondents
and necessarily deductible from their losses,
was estimated to be between $200,000 and $300,000 for the purposes of an
application. The appellant submitted, citing
Plaintiff M76/2013 v
Minister for Immigration, Multicultural Affairs and Citizenship
[2013] HCA 53
, that ‘whether the outcome of the appeal will enure to
either party’s substantial benefit is not a matter upon which
can speculate’.
Plaintiff M76/2013
, the plaintiff had obtained declaratory relief, but
substantial aspects of her case had been rejected. In dissent on the issue of
costs, Kiefel and Keane JJ held (at [242]) that although whether the plaintiff's
success would enure to her substantial benefit was
not a matter upon which the
Court could speculate, she had largely had a Pyrrhic victory and that was not a
sound basis on which
to make an award of costs in her favour. While Kiefel and
Keane JJ would have made no order for costs, the majority (Crennan, Bell
Gageler JJ, with French CJ agreeing) held that the defendant Minister should pay
the plaintiff’s costs, although it is
not entirely clear why. The case is
of little assistance in the determination of the present application.
on the appeal
that the trial Judge was correct to find that it
was the respondents and not the appellant who were entitled to damages for
of the Contract can hardly be described as ‘a Pyrrhic
victory’, regardless of the ultimate award of damages in the Supreme
Court. To find that the respondents were substantially successful on the appeal
is not to speculate about whether the appellant’s
success on the drilling
rig issue will enure to its substantial benefit in the assessment of damages
trial. The appeal is a separate
proceeding in which the appellant sought to
overturn the decision on liability and failed.
appellant argued that there is good reason when assessing costs on an appeal to
avoid apportionments based on degrees of
difficulty of issues, time taken to
argue them and the like, citing
Firebird Global Master Fund II Ltd v Republic
of Nauru (No 2)
[2015] HCA 53
(2015) 90 ALJR 270
. In that case, the appellant had
limited success in the appeal and was unsuccessful on all other issues. The High
Court held as follows
(at [5]-[6]):
If the question of costs is to
be determined on the basis of success on issues, rather than on the outcome of
the appeal, these factors
would not suggest as appropriate an order apportioning
costs, let alone one that Firebird and Nauru pay their own costs, for which
Firebird contends.
In any event, the preferable approach in this case is the one usually taken,
that costs should follow the outcome of the appeal. This
is not a case where it
may be said that the event of success is contestable, by reference to how
separate issues have been determined.
There are no special circumstances to
warrant a departure from the general rule, and good reasons not to encourage
applications regarding
costs on an issue-by-issue basis, involving
apportionments based on degrees of difficulty of issues, time taken to argue
the like. The fact that Firebird retains its registration is immaterial
to the overall outcome of this appeal.
[12] In that
case, the High Court determined to make the usual order as to costs, that they
follow the event, on the basis that the
event of success in that appeal was not
contestable.
[13] In this
case, both parties accept that the event of success was contestable in that each
party had some success on an issue that
may bear on the ultimate outcome of the
case. For that reason, we accept that the usual order as to costs is not
appropriate. However,
it does not follow that the order should be that each
party bears its own costs.
[14] We accept
the respondents’ submission that it was the liability issue which
dominated the appeal, with the appellant both
denying the respondents’
claims and pressing its own entitlement to damages. The vast majority of the
Court’s and the
parties’ time on the appeal was occupied by the
issue of which party had validly terminated the Contract leaving the other
liable in damages for breach, with the drilling rig issue occupying a very small
proportion of the total submissions and the
hearing time. There were 20 grounds
of appeal, with only two of those relating to the drilling rig. The reasons of
the Court of Appeal
were 46 pages long, with the drilling rig issue occupying
eight pages. The transcript of the appellant’s argument on the appeal
50 pages long (including reply), with the argument relating to the drilling rig
occupying two pages. The transcript of the respondents’
argument on the
appeal was 27 pages long, with less than two pages relating to the drilling
[15] While it
may be accepted, as the appellant submitted, that the relationship between costs
of an appeal and time spent on any
particular issue is not linear, the appellant
naturally carries a greater burden of the costs of an appeal than a respondent,
there are difficulties with precise apportionment between issues, it is
clear that a Court may apportion costs as between parties
who have each had a
measure of success, and those are reasons why mathematical precision is illusory
and the exercise of the discretion
as to costs will often depend upon matters of
impression and evaluation.
[16] For the
reasons set out above, using a broad brush approach based on the time taken up
by the issues on which each party was
successful, we consider that a fair and
just result is to order the appellant to pay the respondents 90% of their costs,
to be agreed
Costs of the liability trial
[17] No order
for costs was made by the Supreme Court after the liability trial. Neither party
pursued any order for costs until long
after the appeal was determined.
[18] For similar
reasons as those relating to the costs of the appeal, the plaintiffs/respondents
seek an order that the defendant/appellant
pay 90% of the plaintiffs/respondents
costs of the liability trial.
defendant/appellant argues that orders for costs in relation to the liability
trial should await the outcome of the assessment
of damages and be determined on
the basis of the final outcome of the matter as a whole. Reference was made to
an offer to settle
the matter made before the liability trial, the impact upon
costs of which can only be determined once the outcome of the matter
[20] We decline
to make any order for costs in relation to the liability trial at this stage for
the following reasons.
[21] First, no
order was made by the Supreme Court in relation to costs so the issue of costs
before that Court was not strictly before
this Court on the appeal.
[22] Secondly,
it is appropriate that the costs of the trials at first instance be dealt with
together after the assessment of damages
trial is determined in order to ensure
that the outcome of the proceedings, and the measure of success of each party,
is taken into
account when orders for costs are made. The existence of an offer
of settlement made by the defendant/appellant and rejected by the
plaintiffs/respondents prior to the liability trial makes that determination
important and distinguishes the present case from that
Diakou Nominees Pty
Ltd v Gouger Street Pty Ltd (No 2)
[2017] SASC 115
, where the Supreme Court
of South Australia ordered the unsuccessful party to pay the successful
party’s costs of a trial of
a preliminary issue prior to the trial of the
remaining issues. We do not accept the plaintiffs’/respondents’
that whether or not they fail to better a settlement offer they
rejected prior to the liability trial should only bear upon the award
for the assessment of damages trial.
Disposition
[23] For the
reasons set out above, we make the following orders:
appellant is to pay 90% of the respondents’ costs of and incidental to the
issue of the costs of the liability trial is to be dealt with by the Supreme
Court after the result in the assessment of damages
trial has been
determined.
