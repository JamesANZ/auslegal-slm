The Notice of Employee Representational Rights (NERR) distributed to
employees appears to have a different name for the Agreement
to that which was

The Agreement does not contain a Delegates Rights Term that, in all
respects, is no less favourable than the modern award. I observe
provisions are likely to be inconsistent with the Delegates Rights Term in the

there is an inconsistency between
the Agreement and the Award.
On the basis of the material contained in the application and
accompanying declarations, having regard to the Statement of
Principles,
satisfied that each requirement of ss.186, 187 and 188 as is relevant to this
application for approval has been met.

Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia (
Form F18 statutory declaration giving notice under s.183 of the Act that it
wants the Agreement to cover it. In accordance
with s.201(2) of the Act, I note

The Agreement is approved and will operate in accordance with s.54 of
the Act, from 19 November 2025. The nominal expiry date of the
