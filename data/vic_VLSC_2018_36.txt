conditions0 [2018] VLSC 36
Date of Determination: 30 August 2018
Pursuant to s 299(1) of the Legal Profession Uniform Law (Victoria) (
Uniform Law
), I have decided that the Respondent Lawyer has engaged in
unsatisfactory professional conduct and I make the following order –
Respondent Lawyer is cautioned, pursuant to s 299(1) (a) of the Uniform
STATEMENT OF REASONS
Respondent Lawyer was admitted to practice in Victoria on 19 February 2013.
4 June 2013, the Respondent Lawyer has continuously held an Australian
practising certificate issued in Victoria, authorising
him to engage in legal
practice as an employee of a law practice.

[the Respondent Lawyer’s Law practice] has employed the Respondent Lawyer
since 1 November 2017.
January 2018, the Board received information from a member of the public in
relation to the Respondent Lawyer. This information
gave rise to the concern
that the Respondent Lawyer had been engaging in legal practice outside the terms
of a condition of his practising
certificate.
information included emails sent from the Respondent Lawyer between December
2017 and February 2018 in the course of negotiations
in a partnership
dissolution. Each of the emails sent by the Respondent Lawyer were from a
personal email address and were signed
off as “Lawyer”, with no
company signature. Within the emails, the Respondent Lawyer referred to his
and the nature of the emails indicated that the Respondent
Lawyer was representing a party to the partnership dissolution.
25 June 2018, the Board sent the Respondent Lawyer a designated show cause event
), alleging that he had engaged in legal practice
outside the terms of a condition of his practising certificate.
2 July 2018, the Respondent Lawyer responded to the Notice. In summary, the
Respondent Lawyer acknowledged that he did provide
legal services and advice to
[the clients] in relation to a partnership dissolution between [Company Name 1]
and [Company Name 2]
outside of his employment with [the Respondent
Lawyer’s Law practice] and his previous employer.
31 July 2018, the Acting Victorian Legal Services Commissioner wrote to the
Respondent Lawyer, notifying him that his conduct appeared
to amount to
unsatisfactory professional conduct and proposed a caution as an appropriate
determination.
13 August 2018, the Respondent Lawyer consented in writing to the proposal to
determine his conduct as unsatisfactory professional
conduct and order a

suitability file was opened on 5 June 2018 to establish if the Respondent Lawyer
had engaged in legal practice outside the terms
of a condition on his Australian
practising certificate.
issue under investigation here is whether the conduct amounts to unsatisfactory
professional conduct.
Relevant law
47(1) of the Uniform Law creates the statutory condition that an Australian
practising certificate issued in this jurisdiction,
as determined by the Board,
authorises the holder to engage in legal practice in one or more categories. One
such category is an
“employee of a law practice”.
54 of the Uniform Law states that the holder of an Australian practising
certificate granted in this jurisdiction must comply
with the condition of the
certificate. The penalty for breach of this provision is 100 penalty units.
296 of the Uniform Law states that unsatisfactory professional conduct includes
conduct of a lawyer occurring in connection
with the practice of law that falls
short of the standard of competence and diligence that a member of the public is
entitled to
expect of a reasonably competent lawyer.
298(a) of the Uniform Law provides that conduct consisting of a contravention of
the Uniform Law is capable of constituting
unsatisfactory professional
Findings of fact on issues under
investigation
key issue under determination is whether the Respondent Lawyer engaged in legal
practice outside the terms of a condition of his
Australian practising
certificate.
Respondent Lawyer submitted that the partnership dissolution between [Company
Name 1] and [Company Name 2] commenced at a time
when he was ceasing his
employment with [former law practice], and was considering starting up his own
law practice.
clients (who are his parents-in-law) told the Respondent Lawyer that they were
having difficulties with their business partners,
which prompted the
dissolution. They informed the Respondent Lawyer they were not sure if they
could afford to pay a lawyer to act
for them. The Respondent Lawyer felt
compelled to help them as best as he could, as they had been very generous to
him and his wife.
9 October 2017 and 30 April 2018 (
the Relevant Period
), the Respondent
Lawyer acted for the clients in relation to the dissolution of partnership. This
included drafting heads of agreement,
a deed of dissolution of partnership,
transfer of lease, mortgagee consent to lease and correspondence with the
clients and the other
Respondent Lawyer undertook the necessary work in relation to the partnership
dissolution outside of business hours, and he did
not seek (nor did he receive)
any payment for his legal services in relation to this matter.
the Relevant Period, the Respondent Lawyer held a practising certificate
authorising him to engage in legal practice as an
employee of a law practice
when he provided legal services to [the clients]. He provided these legal
services outside of his employment

is clear that during the Relevant Period, the Respondent Lawyer breached s 54 of
the Uniform Law by engaging in legal practice

Determination & reasons
consideration of the evidence and relevant law, and having made the above
findings on the issues under investigation, I
determine that it is fair and
reasonable in all the circumstances to make the order detailed above.
Respondent Lawyer’s consent to this course of action and order was also a
reason for this determination.
to s. 314 of the Uniform Law, a respondent lawyer or a legal practitioner
associate of a respondent law practice may, in
accordance with the applicable
legislation appeal to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (
), or seek a review by the VCAT, of this determination made under s 299
of the Uniform Law.
