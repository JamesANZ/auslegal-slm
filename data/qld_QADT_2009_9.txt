REPRESENTATION:
Susan Moriarty & Associates, Solicitors, for the complainant.
Mr A Horneman-Wren of Counsel, instructed by Corrs Chambers Westgarth,
for the respondents.
6 April 2009, I ordered the complainant’s complaint be dismissed.
Whilst indicating a preliminary view that each party should
bear their own costs
of the proceeding, I allowed the parties the opportunity to file written
submissions in relation to the question
14 April 2009, the respondents filed written submissions seeking an order
for costs. On 16 April 2009, the complainant filed written
submissions in
reply. The complainant submits the Tribunal’s preliminary view should
prevail, and there should be no order
as to costs.
power to award costs is
discretionary.
Section 213 of the
Anti-Discrimination Act
(1) The Tribunal may order a party to pay such
costs as the Tribunal considers reasonable.
(2) However, costs must be assessed using the scale of costs for the
District Court under the
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999
unless the Tribunal
is satisfied that, because of the complexity of the matter, or because of
another reason, costs should be assessed
using a higher scale.
(3) In deciding whether to order a party to pay costs, the Tribunal may
have regard to -
(a) the reasons for the enactment of this Act as stated in the preamble,
and whether these reasons would be compromised or defeated
by ordering the party
to pay costs; and
(b) the fairness of a costs order, having regard to the following
(i) whether a party has conducted the proceeding in a way that
unnecessarily disadvantaged another party to the proceeding, including,
example, by -
(a) failing to comply with an order or a direction of the Tribunal without
reasonable cause; or
(b) failing to comply with this Act; or
(c) asking for an adjournment as a result of subparagraph (a) or (b);
(d) causing an adjournment; or
(e) attempting to deceive another party or the Tribunal; or
(f) vexatiously conducting the proceeding;
(ii) whether a party has been responsible for prolonging unreasonably the
time taken to complete the proceeding;
(iii) the relative strength of the claims made by each of the
(iv) whether a party reasonably believed there had been a contravention of
(v) the nature and complexity of the proceeding;
(vi) any other matter the Tribunal considers relevant.
(4) Subsection (3) does not limit subsection (1)
written submissions of the parties reveal a number of offers to settle were made
in the course of this proceeding. The existence
of these offers was not, of
course, known to the Tribunal at the time of indicating its preliminary view as
to the disposition of
costs of the proceeding.
Relevantly,
for present purposes, the offers to settle included an offer to settle made by
the first respondent on 19 December 2008.
This offer, which was made in
settlement of the claim against both the first and second respondents, provided
for the complainant
to be paid a sum of $5,000.00, with each party to bear their
own costs. The offer remained open for acceptance until 12 January
am satisfied this offer to settle made by the first respondent complied with the
requirements of the Act in respect of an offer
to settle. Further, the orders
made by the Tribunal in the proceeding are not more favourable to the
complainant than the terms
of that offer. Accordingly, s.213A of the Act has
operation in the present case, and it is open to the Tribunal to make an order
requiring the complainant to pay “
all costs incurred by
respondents]
after the offer was made
determining whether such an order is reasonable in the circumstances, it is
relevant to have regard to the factors to be considered
by the Tribunal in
determining whether it is appropriate to make a costs order. Those factors,
which are listed in
of the Act, are specifically relevant to the making
of an order under s.213A(2) of the
complainant submits it would not be fair to make an order for costs in the
present case, having regard to the chronology of events
leading up to the
hearing of the complaint, the complainant’s personal circumstances, and
the prejudicial effect a costs order
would have upon him. The latter factor
includes a submission that the totality of the costs sought by the respondents,
being estimated
in the order of $100,000.00 would be an excessive imposition
having regard to the complainant’s age, modest income, and the
economic circumstances.
considered the matters set out by the complainant in the written submissions,
and the factors listed in
of the Act, I am satisfied it would not be fair
and reasonable for the complainant to be visited with an order that he pay all
the respondents’ costs of the proceeding. However, I am satisfied it
would be fair and reasonable, having regard to the rejection
of the more
favourable offer to settle, that the complainant be ordered to pay the
respondents’ costs of the proceeding from
the date of expiry of that
coming to this conclusion, I have had regard to the reasons for the enactment of
the Act. I am satisfied such an order for costs
would not compromise or defeat
those reasons. I am also satisfied such an order is fair. Although no party to
the proceedings failed
to comply with orders or directions, or engaged in the
other matters listed in
s.213(3)(b)(i)
of the Act, the failure to accept the
offer resulted in a hearing which could have been avoided had the complainant
accepted the
offer to settle made by the first respondent, and the incurring of
substantially more costs by the respondents.
there was nothing in the nature and complexity of the proceeding which, in my
view, renders the making of a costs order unfair,
the rejection of the more
favourable offer is, in my opinion, a matter which renders the making of a costs
order in favour of the
respondents fair in all the circumstances.
complainant had the opportunity to accept a payment of monies in compromise of
his complaint over one (1) month before the commencement
of the hearing. He
chose not to do so, and obtained an outcome less favourable to him via the
hearing process. The objects of the
Act are not enhanced by encouraging
complainants, who refuse offers of settlement which are favourable to them, to
expect they will
not be visited with an order for costs. The existence of
s.213A of the Act indicates an intention on the part of the legislature
provide specific power for a Tribunal to make a costs order in such
circumstances.
fact the complainant genuinely believed there had been a contravention of the
Act does not negate the importance of a party to
a proceeding being visited with
a costs order where that party declined an offer to settle which was more
favourable than the outcome
obtained by the hearing process.
complainant pay the costs incurred by the first and second respondents from
12 January 2009, such costs to be agreed.
