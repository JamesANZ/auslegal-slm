ONLINE DISPUTE RESOLUTION
EVE SHVARTSMAN
I INTRODUCTION
The increasing use of Online Dispute Resolution (‘ODR’) has
transformed the landscape of negotiation, offering a platform
for parties to
resolve disputes without relying on traditional Alternative Dispute Resolution
(‘ADR’) procedures, settings
and constituents. ODR refers to the use
of digital platforms, tools and technologies to facilitate the resolution of
disputes between
parties through methods such as online mediation, arbitration
and negotiation. It enables parties to engage in dispute resolution
remotely and
asynchronously, often without the need for physical presence or traditional
legal representation. In traditional ADR
settings, it is a participants’
power that greatly influences their effectiveness in performance, persuasion and
overall bargaining
power, according to Fisher in his article
Negotiating Power: Getting and
Using Influence
, is determined by the possession and balance of six key
categories: the power of skill and knowledge, the power of a good relationship,
the power of a good alternative, the power of an elegant solution, the power of
legitimacy, and the power of
commitment.
While the impact of
ADR on these power sources has been well-explored, less attention has been given
to how ODR influences a participant’s
ability to cultivate power through
this framework. This article will argue that ODR fundamentally reconfigures two
of Fisher’s
categories of power in negotiation – the power of skill
and knowledge, and the power of a good relationship – by shifting
these forms of power are accessed, perceived and exercised in digital
environments. By examining these elements, it becomes clear
that in the absence
of physical presence, ODR alters traditional power dynamics, reshaping a
participant’s capacity to exert
influence and enhance bargaining power in
virtual negotiation environments.
II THE POWER OF SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE
The ‘power of skill and knowledge’ in negotiation draws from both
interpersonal and technical skills, coupled with an
in-depth grasp of the
parties, interests, and an understanding of the relevant
While ODR provides
enhanced access to information and structured guidance, facilitating a parties
substantive and procedural knowledge,
it can also limit interpersonal engagement
and the reduce opportunities to leverage relational skills.
A Knowledge
Negotiation is a process by which parties engage in communication to resolve
a dispute, reach an agreement, bargain for advantage,
or develop creative
solutions to meet differing
It goes without argument
that knowledge enhances a participants position in the negotiation process as it
enables informed decision-making,
strategic leverage, and credibility. Knowledge
can be divided into two distinct subsets; (i) knowledge of substance, which
to the specific content and issues at stake, and (ii) knowledge of
process, which encompasses the methods and strategies of
negotiation.
ODR platforms, by
design, often enhance access to both categories. Substantive knowledge is
amplified through integrated resources,
participants to more easily access relevant information. Simultaneously,
procedural knowledge
can be bolstered through the platform’s structured
guidance, tutorials, and sometimes even automated tools that guide users
the negotiation process.
Knowledge of Substance
Knowledge of substance refers to what the parties negotiate over, including
the agenda, the issues, positions and interests, the available
options, and the
terms of the final agreement.
Digital dispute resolution platforms have become increasingly adept in equipping
participants with substantive knowledge specific
to their disputes and have been
able to address informational deficits at pre-claim stages. Customised legal
information and useful
tools are provided to participants at the ‘triage
stage’ where their issues are diagnosed, ensuring that they can be
correctly. The Civil Resolution Tribunal
Columbia exemplifies how ODR can enhance participants’ understanding of
their legal options and foster informed
engagement.
Through its
‘Solutions Explorer’ phase, disputants can explore potential claims
by completing an interactive questionnaire.
Based on responses, the system
generates tailored resources and offers structured guidance on proceeding with a
case. For example,
in workplace bullying disputes, the platform suggests four
possible legal avenues: (1) lodging a complaint under an employer’s
workplace bullying policy, (2) filing a claim with the workplace safety
authority, (3) filing a claim with the human rights tribunal,
or (4) exploring
constructive dismissal. Each option is accompanied by analysis to help users
assess option suitability under different
circumstances, allowing claimants to
make informed decisions on their best course of action. By clarifying key issues
and presenting
realistic options, the CRT helps participants understand
substantive aspects of their dispute and gain access to critical knowledge
might otherwise be inaccessible, thereby fostering awareness and enhancing a
participant’s ability to proactively engage
and exert influence in a
negotiation. In the Australian context, ODR platforms such as
provide specialised resources for separated couples navigating family
Prior to registration,
users complete a similar initial assessment to ensure a foundational
understanding of essential concepts,
such as the legal definition of a
‘separated couple’ and any relevant limitation periods for filing
formal court orders.
This preliminary phase enables participants to identify
complexities they may have overlooked, such as financial assets held in trust
property located overseas. These diagnostic steps not only surface potential
issues and overlooked details that could positively
impact their results, but
also help identify underlying interests by prompting participants to reflect on
their unique circumstances
and priorities. In fact, only 13.5% of queries at the
pre-claim stage progress into formal claims, suggesting that this early-stage
provision of information equips individuals with relevant knowledge that
enhances their understanding of key issues and avenues,
and thus positively
impacts their ability to exert influence and take agency over their
By bridging
informational gaps, ODR platforms enhance a participants’ capacity to
understand their circumstances, options and
associated risks, facilitating a
more informed and constructive dispute resolution
One might argue, however, that the sheer volume of information provided
through ODR could overwhelm participants, complicating their
ability to utilise
it effectively – particularly when compared to the targeted, tailored
guidance typically available through
a legal professional in ADR settings. While
this concern has merit, it is important to recognise that not all disputants
have access
to legal counsel and may enter negotiations or mediations without
such support. This lack of guidance is often evident in residential
disputes, where tenants without legal support struggle to assert their rights
effectively. For example, a tenant facing an
overbearing landlord might accept
unfair terms simply due to a limited understanding of their legal entitlements
and available remedies.
Without clear information, tenants may feel powerless to
challenge issues like unlawful rent increases, improper bond claims, or
inadequate maintenance responses. However, if the tenant had access to relevant,
accessible information – such as resources
provided through ODR platforms
– they could be better positioned to challenge the landlord’s firm
stance, shift the power
dynamic in their favour, and achieve a fairer outcome,
even without formal legal
representation.
negotiators toward pertinent options, arguments, and potential pathways, ODR
mitigates knowledge gaps and bargaining
This strengthens
participants’ positions and enhances their ability to secure more
favourable outcomes even before negotiations
Equally important, however, is a comprehensive understanding of the processes
involved in ODR mediations, an aspect which empowers
individuals to effectively
manage and sustain their influence throughout the mediation itself.
Knowledge of Process
Knowledge of process refers to an understanding of how negotiations operate,
encompassing the context of the negotiation, the identities
and roles of
participants, the tactics employed, and the stages and sequences through which
the negotiation unfolds.
party’s influence is closely tied to their confidence in the negotiation
and familiarity with the unfolding process fosters predictability, enhancing
decision-making assurance throughout dispute resolution.
ODR platforms play a
pivotal role in enhancing this confidence by providing comprehensive guidance on
procedural aspects related
For instance, CRT offers a detailed, step-by-step guide for filing or
responding to a claim, complete with explicit instructions for
each phase of the
process. Continuing with the above-mentioned example of workplace bullying, if a
user decides to proceed with option
(1) and file a complaint with their
employer, the platform supplies negotiation resources and strategies, including
preparatory techniques,
brainstorming sessions for potential solutions, relevant
questions to pose to the opposing party, as well as templates for written
agreements prior to initiation. This structured approach equips participants
with the essential procedural knowledge that empowers
them to take control of
their actions and fosters confidence in their decisions, thereby enhancing their
capacity to exert influence.
While ODR platforms provide participants with a clear understanding of
procedural aspects, they don't necessarily enhance knowledge
of negotiation
tactics or strategies that influence the process. Just as a novice chess player
equipped with an instruction manual
may still be outmanoeuvred by a skilled
opponent, ODR’s technological tools cannot fully compensate for
disparities in negotiation
experience. Both parties may have equal access to
information, but it’s the depth of experience – knowing when and how
to deploy specific skills or tactics – that can shift the balance of
power. Technology alone doesn’t level the field;
instead, it’s the
expertise applied to the information that truly bolsters one’s
Overall, ODR platforms equip participants with essential knowledge of
substantive issues and procedural frameworks, allowing them
to understand their
disputes more thoroughly, identify informational gaps, and exercise greater
control over the negotiation process.
By enhancing participants’
knowledge, ODR shifts power dynamics, enabling more informed decision-making.
However, because ODR
doesn’t provide guidance on negotiation tactics or
strategy, it leaves the influence of experience-based power untouched.
Consequently,
while participants may be better informed, ODR may still limit the
development and application of practical negotiation skills rooted
experience. Offering information on common strategies and tactics, such as
anchoring and framing, could improve these platforms
by helping participants
recognise and respond to these procedural nuances, enhancing their overall
negotiating awareness.
Negotiation skills encompass a range of knowledge and behaviours that
directly impact bargaining
performance.
At their core,
negotiations aim to create mutual understanding and agreements between parties,
with effective communication –
especially the interpretation of non-verbal
cues – playing a key role in a negotiator’s ability to influence and
to the demands of the other
However, digital
platforms like ODR alter how these cues are expressed and interpreted, affecting
power dynamics during negotiations.
As Ebner notes, ODR’s reliance on
digital communication lacks the ‘human touch’, which includes
essential soft
skills like empathy and active
These skills are
critical for shaping attitudes, mindsets, and behaviours, and ultimately, for
exerting influence in
negotiations.
ODR’s mode of communication – whether asynchronous, such as
through email or chat, or synchronous, such as via video conference
significantly influences the presence of these human or connecting elements. In
asynchronous interactions, aspects such as
tone, facial expressions, and body
language are entirely absent, while synchronous interactions may only provide a
limited capacity
for these cues.
Regardless of the mode employed, the opportunity to cultivate and utilise soft
negotiation skills is substantially diminished in
virtual environments,
impacting the overall effectiveness of the dispute resolution process.
Despite these limitations, it can be argued that post COVID-19, there is an
enhanced capacity to understand elements of the ‘human
touch’ in a
digital environment, as the pervasive reliance on video conferencing and remote
communication has become a central
aspect of many workplaces and daily
communication.
This shift in
communication practices may foster greater sensitivity to the nuances of
interpersonal interactions, with emotional
intelligence rising and adapting to
the increasingly pervasive digital
environments.
This development,
however, should not be overstated, as certain facets of in-person interaction
remain compromised, even in a society
that is highly technologically
Sharing a physical
space for example, allows participants to inhabit a collective environment where
they can focus on and respond
to the same world. In a physically shared
environment, certain interactions, such as a wave or a smile directed at a
specific individual,
enhance a participant’s understanding of the social
context. In contrast, an online environment can hinder one’s ability
discern the intended recipient of such actions, thereby undermining social
understanding and meaningful engagement with
While virtual presence
continues to expand and virtual reality technology advances, digital platforms

that enhance negotiation power through the
development and application of interpersonal skills.
The limitations inherent in digital environments restrict the nuanced
interpersonal dynamics that are central to effective negotiation,
such as the
real-time interpretation of non-verbal cues and the spontaneous adaptation of
communicative strategies. The effect of
this limitation is discussed in more
detail below in Part IIIB, but for now it is pertinent to note that ODR is not
an effective
environment in which to exercise these skills. Effective
negotiation requires the broader utilisation of a range of skills that extend
beyond those available in ODR platforms, which, at best, present only a limited
or myopic offering.
In evaluating ODR’s capacity to enhance participants’ negotiation
power through Fisher’s ‘knowledge and skill’
category of
power, it becomes clear that ODR increases accessibility and technical
competencies by offering structured guidance and
legal resources. However, it
may simultaneously limit opportunities for developing interpersonal and adaptive
negotiation skills,
potentially leaving parties with a more procedural rather
than strategic understanding of the dispute resolution process. Further,
cannot yet patch the void generated by the lack of non-verbal cues, and
inability to employ communication skills, limiting any
power that may derive
from this facet of influence. Thus, while ODR positively augments the power
derived from knowledge, it falls
short in empowering participants with the full
spectrum of skills and strategies necessary to navigate and influence complex
negotiations.
III THE POWER OF A GOOD RELATIONSHIP
The second category of power in negotiation according to Fisher, is a strong
working relationship, which is fundamentally rooted in
two interrelated pillars;
trust and communication.
ODR environment, spatial and temporal limitations affect how these relational
dynamics are perceived and developed, and participants
are forced to redefine
the concept of trust and effective
communication.
ODR, like negotiation in general, relies on a foundational level of
interpersonal trust, rooted in the parties’ mutual dependence
resolution.
While this baseline
trust is essential for moving negotiations forward, it is a party’s
trustworthiness which is central to their negotiating power, as
it directly influences their ability to gain their counterpart’s
confidence and sway outcomes.
ODR platforms reshape how participants perceive the trustworthiness of the other
party by altering the traditional dynamics of communication
and interaction. In
the context of digital platforms, the perception of trustworthiness is
influenced by three key dimensions: ability,
benevolence, and integrity, which
are reframed through the constraints and affordances of online
communication.
A negotiator’s perceived ‘ability’ encompasses their
negotiation skills and competencies, the demonstration of which
perceptions of legitimacy and
trustworthiness.
As demonstrated
in Part II of this article, ODR platforms equip participants with extensive
resources and provides guidance through
varying stages of the dispute to deepen
process comprehension and boost issue-specific knowledge. On the assumption that
a participant
engages with the provided material, ODR improves competency and
may positively affect the perceived ability of
While this does not
necessarily mean that parties are experts in negotiation and its context, ODR
allows for a higher base-level
understanding of expectations and legal avenues,
providing for more rational and therefore more trustworthy
behaviours.
Benevolence
Perceived ‘benevolence’ in negotiations refers to the belief that
the other party is engaging in the process with mutual
respect and positive
intent, rather than pursuing objectives with harmful
While benevolence is
typically conveyed through behaviours like active listening and commitment to
shared goals, ODR requires unique
approaches to signal these qualities due to
limited communication cues and reduced personal
ODR’s impact on perceived benevolence is nuanced and hinges on factors
such as the presence or absence of a pre-existing relationship
and the emotional
dynamics involved.
In situations
where parties have no prior social connection, ODR may hinder perceptions of
benevolence due to the ‘sinister
attribution bias’ – a
cognitive tendency to ascribe negative interpretations in the absence of clear
social cues.
In e-commerce
disputes, for instance, a complainant may distrust a large corporate respondent,
such as eBay, due to the inherent
bureaucratic impersonality, lack of rapport
and familiarity. Additionally, the digital environment in ODR can heighten
distrust when
parties employ ethically ambiguous negotiation tactics –
like bluffing or concealment – without the benefit of clarifying
cues, further complicating perceived goodwill and fostering distrustful
attributions.
Conversely, for parties with an emotionally charged pre-existing
relationship, ODR may mitigate tensions by reducing face-to-face
confrontations,
thus fostering a more collaborative, less adversarial
atmosphere.
The asynchronous
nature of online communication in ODR affords participants time to review and
reflect before responding, which may
foster more respectful and neutral replies,
thereby strengthening the perception of goodwill and reducing the emotional
A party’s ability to foster perceived benevolence – and thereby
strengthen influence – depends on the nature of
their prior relationship.
In emotionally charged disputes, ODR can stabilise interactions and promote
constructive engagement. However,
between unfamiliar parties, the lack of
rapport can heighten distrust through sinister attribution bias. Thus,
ODR’s impact
on perceived benevolence varies significantly based on
whether parties share an emotionally complex history or are
for the first time.
Perceived ‘integrity’ refers to behaviours such as truthfulness,
honouring promises, fulfilling commitments, and adhering
to a clear set of
professional or ethical principles, which collectively establish confidence in
the negotiator’s honest motivations
intentions.
Perception of
one’s integrity is likely the most influential factor in whether a party
will be perceived as trustworthy, as
it goes directly to one’s character.
For this reason, a violation of one’s perceived integrity is most harmful
to a trusting
relationship.
ODR platforms, through their inherent record-keeping capabilities, offer
unique advantages in reinforcing these perceptions. The digital
environment
allows parties to track commitments transparently, document follow-through, and
demonstrate reliability, enhancing confidence
in the other party’s
professionalism and honesty. The structured format of ODR interactions also
fosters accountability, reducing
the likelihood of parties reneging on
agreements or disputing past exchanges. However, the online space limits
relational cues and
informal interactions that contribute to character judgments
in face-to-face settings, meaning integrity in ODR is often judged by
consistency and communication style alone. A single breach in integrity –
such as inconsistent responses or a lack
of follow-through – can thus
severely damage trust within ODR, where traditional means of trust-building are
Consequently,
ODR’s emphasis on procedural transparency supports integrity, yet it
requires participants to build trust primarily
on formal interactions and
digital conduct, which can sometimes fail to fully convey a negotiator's ethical

integrity reveals varied impacts.
is often strengthened by
ODR’s structured resources, empowering participants to navigate
negotiations confidently.
Benevolence
may improve in emotionally charged
disputes, as ODR’s formal setting can stabilise interactions. However,
is limited by the digital medium, where the lack of in-person
cues restricts assessments of character to procedural compliance. Overall,
participant's ability to display trustworthiness and, consequently, their
ability to gain confidence and sway decisions, depends
on the interplay of these
factors, which will be achieved differently in ODR contexts compared to
traditional ADR settings.
B Communication
Communication is the backbone of the entire negotiation process, so the
ability to engage effectively is crucial to one’s capacity
influence and gain bargaining power. In ODR, communication relies on either
asynchronous or synchronous methods, each impacting
what is known as
‘media richness’ – a concept that measures a medium’s
capacity to convey information across
four criteria: immediacy of feedback, the
number of social cues transmitted, the range of meaning conveyed through
language, and
the ability to express personal feelings and
Face-to-face
communication is considered the ‘richest’ medium, as it allows for
immediate responses and conveys personal
presence that extends beyond the basic
content of a message.
With its reliance on text-based platforms like online chat or email, and
occasional use of videoconferencing, ODR is void of face-to-face
interaction.
This limits its media richness, potentially affecting both the clarity of
communication and the collaborative or relational
dynamics essential to
negotiation.
videoconferences can approximate the richness of face-to-face interactions,
minor yet significant elements like subtle gestures,
posture, and eye contact
may yet be compromised. Chat platforms, however, lack aural, visual, and
non-verbal cues altogether, which
are integral to ‘rich’
communication. Consequently, essential elements such as intonation and body
language must be adapted
to the online
According to the social information processing theory, individuals can build
meaningful digital connections and communicate effectively
by using online cues
such as typographic alteration and chronemic
indicators.
Typographic
alterations, such as capitalisation, onomatopoeia, repetition, punctuation, and
emoticons, play a crucial role in conveying
emotional and non-verbal cues within
For instance, capitalised
words or phrases, like ‘I DON’T AGREE WITH THIS AT ALL’,
convey a sense of anger and
signal a clear stance, while onomatopoeic
expressions like ‘ummm’ or ‘oooh’ indicate confusion,
or interest.
Punctuation, including exclamation and question marks, can further convey
emphasis or request clarification, while emoticons, such
as smiley faces,
enhance rapport and provide non-verbal emotional
These typographical
variations enhance the richness of ODR as a communication medium, however the
context is important, as capitalisation,
repetition and onomatopoeia as
mechanisms for conveying non-verbal cues may be omitted in more formalised
Chronemics, or
time-related cues like response delays or pauses, also play a critical role in
shaping impressions.
chat-based ODR, asynchronous interactions may lack immediate feedback, which can
detract from the conversational flow and potentially
impact perceptions of
progress or engagement.
asynchronous communication offers mediators a unique tool: the ability to
reframe potentially divisive messages, allowing
emotionally charged statements
to be moderated before reaching the other
Further, it is arguable
that the written word, when properly expressed can be the most persuasive way to
express a participant’s
true intent and feelings, as it omits other
possibly distracting visual cues that may or may not be relevant to the
information conveyed.
Overall, ODR’s reliance on text-based communication and absence of
face-to-face interaction limits the ‘richness’
of communication,
making it harder for parties to interact effectively based on social,
environmental, or body cues that are typically
influential in traditional
negotiations. While the power derived from parties’ abilities to
communicate clearly and effectively
is diminished, there is still room for
emotional and affective nuances to be conveyed through typographic cues and
chronemics, offering
negotiators opportunities to influence and gage sentiments
and maintain some degree of power in the negotiation process.
IV CONCLUSION
In conclusion, this article has demonstrated how ODR fundamentally reshapes
the traditional power dynamics central to negotiation.
By examining
Fisher’s categories of the ‘power of skill and knowledge’ and
the ‘power of a good relationship’,
it is clear that ODR’s
digital environment both empowers and constrains participants in unique ways. On
one hand, ODR enhances
negotiators’ access to information and structured
procedural guidance, empowering participants by bolstering their substantive
procedural knowledge. This increased accessibility levels the playing field for
those who may lack formal legal support, allowing
them to engage more
knowledgeably in negotiation. However, the very nature of ODR imposes
limitations, particularly on the relational
power that stems from interpersonal
skills such as active listening, non-verbal cues, and rapport-building –
all crucial in
traditional negotiation settings for establishing trust and
credibility. The reliance on text-based, asynchronous communication restricts
these relational dynamics, diminishing the power derived from building authentic
connections and fostering trust.
While ODR facilitates efficiency and accessibility, it also underscores the
need for improved tools that can replicate the richness
of in-person
interactions. Future developments in ODR could focus on integrating multimedia
elements – such as video or voice
options – which could benefit less
contentious disputes by restoring some of the immediacy and interpersonal
engagement crucial
to effective negotiation. Additionally, research into how
specific ODR technologies impact trust-building, emotional expression,
strategic communication could yield insights that refine and humanise virtual
negotiation processes. By addressing these gaps,
ODR has the potential to evolve
into a platform where power dynamics are redefined to better support fair and
balanced negotiation
