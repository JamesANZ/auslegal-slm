Reasons for Decision
Background to review
Applicant made a request to the Agency seeking access to the following
Any correspondence between [the Agency] and [third
parties] regarding an investigation into a cancelled Big Bash match in Geelong
on December 10. 2023 and subsequent compensation.
Agency identified 69 documents falling within the terms of the Applicant’s
request and refused access to 59 documents in
full under sections 30(1) and
34(4)(a)(ii) and released ten documents in part with third party personal
affairs information deleted.
The Agency’s decision letter sets out the
reasons for its decision.
Review application
Applicant sought review by the Information Commissioner under section 49A(1) of
the Agency’s decision to refuse access.
have examined a copy of the documents subject to review.
Applicant and the Agency were invited to make a written submission under section
49H(2) in relation to the review.
have considered relevant communications and submissions received from the
undertaking my review, I have had regard to the object of the FOI Act, which is
to create a general right of access to information
in the possession of the
Government or other public bodies, limited only by exceptions and exemptions
necessary to protect essential
public interests, privacy and business
note Parliament’s intention the FOI Act must be interpreted so as to
further the object of the Act and any discretions conferred
by the Act must be
exercised, as far as possible, so as to facilitate and promote the disclosure of
information in a timely manner
and at the lowest reasonable cost.
Initial enquiries by OVIC
the review, OVIC staff advised the Agency of my preliminary view that section
30(1) does not apply to the documents because
they do not disclose consultation
or deliberation between Agency officers, and consultation or deliberation
between an officer and
an external third party (that is not engaged by the
agency) is not exempt under section 30(1). Many of the documents are from third
parties, namely, [names of third parties], and therefore, the documents are not
in the nature of opinion, advice or recommendation
from an Agency officer.
Agency was also advised that I was considering whether section 34(4)(a)(ii)
applied, however, further information would be required
to be satisfied the
exemption applied, and that I was also considering if section 31(1)(b) was
relevant in the circumstances.
Agency provided further information that informed my view on sections
34(4)(a)(ii) and 31(1)(b). Based on the information before
me, I will only
consider section 34(4)(a)(ii).
Review of exemption
document or information is exempt under section 34(4)(a)(ii) if three conditions
are satisfied:
(a) the agency is engaged in trade or commerce; and
(b) the document contains information of a business, commercial or financial
nature; and
(c) disclosure of the information would be likely to expose the agency
unreasonably to disadvantage.
exemption in section 34(4)(a)(ii) is intended to apply where a public sector
body conducts itself or part of its operations, in
a manner similar to a
commercial entity.
Is the Agency engaged in trade or
words trade or commerce are expressions of fact and terms of common
an agency is engaged in trade or commerce depends on the specific facts and
circumstances. It requires clear evidence that
the agency is doing more than
delivering government services or functions.
or commerce activities must ‘of their nature, bear a trading or commercial
character’.
business, commercial or financial information must be connected to the trade or
commerce activity that the agency is engaged in
(not government services or
functions).
Agency administers, promotes and manages the GMHBA stadium and hosts various
sporting matches throughout the year.
accept that it competes with other commercial entities/venues throughout
Australia to host sporting events.
documents subject to review concern correspondence between the Agency and other
commercial entities following the cancellation
of a Big Bash League match at the
GMHBA stadium.
accept the Agency is engaged in trade and commerce with respect to its
activities relating to hosting sporting events at the GMHBA
Do the documents contain information of a business, commercial or
financial nature?
information must have a business, commercial, or financial nature.
‘Business’, ‘commercial’ and ‘financial’
should each be given their ordinary
am satisfied the documents contain information of a business, commercial and
financial nature.
Would disclosure of the documents be likely to
expose the Agency unreasonably to disadvantage?
determining if disclosure is likely to expose the Agency unreasonably to
disadvantage, three distinct elements must be identified
and considered:
(a) what the disadvantage is;
(b) why and when disadvantage is likely to occur; and
(c) the disadvantage is unreasonable.
agency must be able to explain how disclosing the information would unreasonably
expose the agency to disadvantage. Tribunals and
courts describe
‘disadvantage’ in terms of the business, commercial or financial
implications of disclosure. In particular,
whether disclosure is likely to:
agency’s capacity to compete in a competitive market for buying and
selling goods or services;
agency’s capacity to negotiate future commercial
strengthen the
bargaining position of entities the agency negotiates with, at the expense of
the agency competing for marketplace
expose the rates
that an agency is prepared to accept for various services – and if so, the
likely impact on the agency’s
operations.
this instance, I am satisfied that disclosing the documents will be likely to
expose the Agency to disadvantage in the following
(a) it will reasonably likely impact its existing commercial relationships;
(b) it will reasonably likely impact the Agency’s capacity to favourably
negotiate future commercial contracts; and
(c) it will reasonably likely impact the Agency’s resolution of
outstanding matters relating to the cancellation of the match
in a fair manner.
above disadvantages would result in the Agency missing opportunities to host
future sporting events, given the Agency competes
with other entities to host
sporting matches.
test is one of likelihood rather than certainty. It means ‘probable, such
as well might happen or be
am satisfied the disadvantage resulting from disclosure of the documents would
be probable.
disadvantage would be unreasonable involves the consideration of all
circumstances, including factors both in favour of, and
against disclosure, such
circumstances in which the information was obtained or
The documents were created following the
cancellation of the match, which affected several parties including the Agency.
The nature of
the information
The documents are sensitive commercial
communications relating to the cancellation of the match.
Whether the
information has any current relevance
The cancellation of the
match occurred over a year ago. Nevertheless, the documents still have relevance
to the Agency given its ongoing
commercial relationships and future tendering.
Disclosure of the documents would reasonably likely impact its current
relationships and future tendering given the sensitive content within
the documents.
Whether there
is any public interest in disclosure or nondisclosure
public may be curious about the circumstances that led to the cancellation of
the game and the discussion between affected
parties following the cancellation,
I am not satisfied there is a public interest in disclosure of the documents.
Disclosing the
documents will not contribute to informed public debate about an
issue impacting the general population.
The identity
of the applicant and the likely motives of the applicant
consider it is reasonably likely that the Applicant intends to publish
information within the documents, should they be released.
I am satisfied that disclosing the documents would be likely to expose the
Agency unreasonably to disadvantage.
all three conditions of the exemption has been met, I am satisfied the documents
are exempt from release under section 34(4)(a)(ii).
– Deletion of exempt or irrelevant information
25 requires an agency to grant access to an edited copy of a document where it
is practicable to delete exempt or irrelevant
information and the applicant
agrees to receiving such a copy.
Determining
what is ‘practicable’ requires consideration of the effort and
editing involved in making the deletions ‘from
a resources point of
and the effectiveness
of the deletions. Where deletions would render a document meaningless, they are
not ‘practicable’
and release of the document is not required under
section 25.
Applicant advised they do not seek access to personal affairs information of
third parties. Accordingly, information that identifies
third parties is
irrelevant information for the purpose of my review. The Agency has redacted
such information from the documents,
where documents have been released to the
Applicant in part.
am satisfied it is not practicable to release edited copies of the documents
that the Agency exempted in full to delete exempt and
irrelevant information.
The Agency has already released some documents to the Applicant in part, with
personal affairs information
deleted in accordance with section
the information before me, I am satisfied certain information in the documents
is exempt from release under section 34(4)(a)(ii).
decision is that no further information in the documents is to be released to
the Applicant.
