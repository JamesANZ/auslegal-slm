Smith v A Team Cleaning Services Pty Ltd
[2024] WAIRC 00290
Reasons for Decision
THE FULL BENCH:
Brief background
appellant commenced a claim at first instance, ostensibly under s 60A of
Industrial Relations Act 1979
(WA), for an equal remuneration order,
on a Form 1 – General Application. However, the substance of the
application suggested
that the appellant was seeking the recovery of wages for
work performed for the respondent, and for which she claimed she was not
As a consequence of events in relation to the application at first instance, the
learned Commissioner listed the appellant’s
application for a hearing to
show cause why it should not be dismissed for want of prosecution on 11 June
2024. The recitals to
the order made on that day (
Smith v A Team Cleaning
Services Pty Ltd
[2024] WAIRC 00290)
reveal that the application was
listed for show cause for a variety of reasons as follows:
WHEREAS Ms Smith has shown a general pattern of behaviour of not progressing her
application for some weeks, has not contacted
the Commission, has not complied
with directions from the Commission nor emails from Registry or the Commission
and did not attend
the hearing today. The Commission considers that Ms Smith has
had ample opportunity to prosecute her application but has not done

application and application APPL 91 of 2024 should
be dismissed under
Industrial Relations Act 1979
(WA) for want of prosecution;
learned Commissioner also referred in the recitals to the order, to the notice
provided to the appellant that should she not appear
at the show cause
proceedings, then the application would be dismissed for want of prosecution.
The appellant did not appear at the
show cause hearing and the application was
appellant has appealed against the order issued by the learned Commissioner
dismissing her application. The sole basis for the
challenge to the order was
that the appellant was unable to attend the hearing on 11 June 2024, because a
family member had passed
away earlier that day. No other reasons were advanced
by the appellant as to why the appeal should be upheld. In particular, the
appellant did not challenge any of the learned Commissioner’s findings in
the extract from her order set out above. That is,
there was no challenge by
the appellant that she had not conducted the application at first instance with
all due expedition, had
failed to make contact with the Commission or the
Registry, or respond to communications from the Registry or the Commission, and
that she did not comply with directions issued by the Commission in connection
with her claim.
Consideration
this appeal is from a discretionary decision of the Commission, the approach to
determining the appeal is well established. In
Magyar v Department of Education
[2019] WAIRC 00781
(2019) 99 WAIG 1595
in the decision of the Full Bench,
I observed as follows at [12]:
[12] Given that the three appeals
before the Full Bench arise from a discretionary decision of the Commission at
first instance, the
well-known principles set out in
House v The King
[1936] HCA 40
(1936) 55 CLR
apply. That is, it is not sufficient for an appellant to persuade the Full
Bench that it should reach a different decision to that
of the learned
Commissioner. It is necessary that the appellant establish an error in the
exercise of the Commission’s discretion,
such as the learned Commissioner
acting upon a wrong principle; making a material mistake in relation to the
facts; failing to take
into account relevant considerations or taking into
account irrelevant considerations; or allowing extraneous or irrelevant matters
to affect his decision making:
Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v
Australian Industrial Relations Commission
(2003) 203 CLR 194.
Coal and Allied
at par 72, emphasised that an appeal court, considering
an appeal from a discretionary decision, should proceed with appropriate
and restraint.
is also the case that subject to very limited exceptions, not relevant for
present purposes, an appeal under
is to be heard and
determined on the evidence and matters raised in the proceedings before the
(s 49(4)(a)).
the learned Commissioner had before her at first instance was a circumstance
where an applicant in proceedings before the Commission,
had not shown diligence
in the conduct of her claim. As we have already observed, the learned
Commissioner’s findings that
she made, set out above, were not challenged
on the appeal. The only challenge related to the appellant’s failure to
at the show cause proceedings on 11 June 2024.
the appellant submitted to the Full Bench that given the circumstances she
described in her notice of appeal meant she could
not appear before the
Commission on 11 June 2024, there was, at the least, an opportunity to
inform the learned Commissioner’s
Chambers or the Registry, prior to the
commencement time of the hearing, of her difficulties on that day. No such
attempt was made.
Nor was there any attempt made by a person on behalf of the
appellant. It was clear on the material before the learned Commissioner,
well prior to the hearing on 11 June 2024, the appellant had been informed
that the application was going to be listed for
a hearing for show cause why it
should not be dismissed. The appellant was also notified that should she fail
to appear at the hearing,
then the application would be dismissed. This should
have made it very clear to the appellant, the importance of her attendance
the hearing on 11 June 2024, or, that if for whatever reason she could not
do so, the importance of communicating that to the
Commission before the hearing
all that was before the learned Commissioner, we are not persuaded that the
appellant has established that there was any error
made by the Commission in its
decision to dismiss the appellant’s claim. The conclusions reached by the
learned Commissioner
were all reasonably open to her, on what was before the
Commission. In the absence of any appealable error being demonstrated by
appellant, as required by
House v King
, the Full Bench should
dismiss the appeal, which we would do.
would add that the circumstances for the appellant were obviously unfortunate.
However, this case highlights the importance of
parties to proceedings before
the Commission, to promptly communicate with the Commission or the Registry, any
difficulties in relation
to a required appearance, especially where the
consequences of not doing so may lead to a dismissal of proceedings, as in this
appeal is dismissed.
