EXEMPT LAND - RESIDENCE
BRIAN PADDICK AND STONE BOUTIQUE AUSTRALIA PTY LTD v SEPPO SAKARI KARVONEN FOR
THE KARVONEN FAMILY TRUST
I attended on site at
Wallaroo. Mr Robert Cameron and Mr Dimitri Tahan were in attendance for Stone
Boutique Australia Pty Ltd and
for Mr Stephen Brian Paddick the holder of ML
6277 executed in November 2007 for the harlequin granite and EML 6155 executed
2004 for the limestone that overlays the granite. Mr Seppo Karvonen
was in attendance for AustralAsian Granite Pty Ltd and the
Karvonen Family
Trust. We had a free ranging discussion and it became clear that no facts upon
which I need to rely are in dispute.
In preparing these reasons I have had
regard to those discussions, which were recorded, a copy of the mining and
rehabilitation
program (MARP), a written submission by Stephen Brian Paddick and
Stone Boutique Australia Pty Ltd and written submissions by the
Karvonen Family
Trust from Wallmans Lawyers dated 21 January 2008 and from Mr Karvonen dated 29
January 2009.
These facts are clear.
AustralAsian Granite Pty Ltd purchased the freehold land with a shack on it from
Mr Schmitzky in about March
2006. I had previously removed the exemption around
the dwelling to permit AustralAsian Granite Pty Ltd to continue to
Mr Karvonen says the
purchase price was $167,000 plus stamp duty and associated costs. In September
2006 it was transferred it
to the Karvonen Family Trust for the same sum. Mr
Schmitzky remained in the property until mid 2006. After he left the shack has
been vacant. It is now derelict. Mr Karvonen has no intention of living in the
shack. Mr Karvonen says it has always been his
intention to build a new modern
family residence on the block and initially he thought workers might reside in
it but now he intends
to live in it himself. Consistent with that he had plans
drawn up starting in early 2006 and submitted them with the local District
Council shortly after the settlement of the property in September 2006.
Development approval was granted on the 22nd of February
2007. New plans for a
larger two-story dwelling were submitted to the Council in August 2007 and
development approval for them was
granted in October 2007. No work has been
undertaken on site.
Mr Cameron believes that
the application for approval of a residence is a ploy to revive the exemption
that surrounds a residential
dwelling so as to frustrate the proposed a new
quarry. Mr Karvonen says his intention to build and live in the premises is
fides. He is however willing to abandon those plans if the new quarry
operator purchases the land from him at the cost he has incurred
in purchasing
it from Mr Schmitzky, the plus the planning and other
The first question is whether in these
circumstances there is an exemption around the proposed residence. I considered
of a workers residence in
Southern Titanium NL v Heidrich and
(April 2004) Wardens Court Report 1 at pp 39-42 and noted in that
case that a derelict house was not a residence and workers houses
there had a
different status to a principle place of residence. That precedent does not
decide the threshold issue here, which is
whether a piece of land purchased with
a residence on it, but which then becomes vacant whilst plans to build a new
residence are
submitted for approval, maintains the exempt status within 400
metres of the proposed residence.
Mining Act 1971
(1) (d) land
that is situated—
(i) within 400 metres of a building or structure used as a place of
residence ...
shall be exempt from mining operations in pursuance of this Act and, unless
the land ceases to be so exempt, no miner's right, claim,
lease or licence shall
authorise prospecting, exploring or mining upon such land (but this section does
not prevent the pegging out
of a claim upon such land).
(2) Where any land is subject to a claim, lease or licence under this Act and
that land would, but for this subsection, be land exempt
from mining operations
in pursuance of this Act by reason only of a fact or circumstance occurring or
arising subsequent to the pegging
out, or granting, of the claim, lease or
licence, that land shall not be exempt from operations in pursuance of this
It makes no difference whether
Mr Karvonen intends to build a residence to gain the benefit of an exemption.
As long as he builds
a dwelling and someone resides in it, it becomes “
... a building or structure used as a place of residence.” Accepting
Karvonen's bona fides, he formed the intention to build a new residence before
he purchased on the existing residence. The question
is then, if an existing
residence is purchased with the intention of replacing it with a better one, is
either the existing residence,
or the proposed new residence “... a
building or structure used as a place of residence.” What does
mean in this context? A vacancy during a major renovation
may not remove the status of the building as a residence. Even the demolition
and expeditious replacement of a building may in some circumstances constitute a
continuous notional use of it as a place of residence.
However, in this case
no one has lived in the existing residence since mid 2006 and it is derelict and
no longer in a state to
be used as a place of residence. More than a year after
its last use as a residence in November 2007 when the new mining lease 6277
into existence it could not be called “... a building or structure used as
a place of residence.” The proposed
new building has not been started
and cannot be notionally a building or structure.
Subsection 9(2)
clear that where the circumstance giving a rise to a claim of exemption is
subsequent to the granting of a lease the exemption
does not arise against that
prior lease.
That is sufficient to dispose of
this application. I find that there is no building or structure that is used as
a place of residence
and hence no exempt land for that reason. If I am wrong
and the exemption that existed for the now derelict dwelling has remained
place whilst approvals are obtained to replace it, then I would remove the
exemption upon conditions designed to ameliorate the
imposition of the new
quarry. My basis for this would be consistent with the approach I took between
Mr Schmitsky and Australasian
Granite Pty
The new quarry is the same
sort operation as the existing quarry, and conditions that are realistic for the
proposed operator can
be fashioned that are sufficient to protect the resident,
in the circumstances of a residence purchased by the existing owner in
knowledge that it was close to an operating
I note that the approach taken in
this judgment has the potential to cause injustice to a bona fide purchaser who
pays a premium price
for land reflecting an existing use of it for residential
purposes. If s/he lets the residence become derelict whilst gaining approval
replace it, a mining operator may obtain a lease without the usual exemption
being in place. Each case will depend on its particular
facts. I note that I
am not aware of this circumstance in fact arising until now.
I also note that the applicant has benefited
without expense from the fact that AustralAsian Granite Pty Ltd purchased Mr
Schmitzky’s
property and removed the problems of having a residence in
such close proximity to a quarry. I have no power to order the new operator
pay compensation for that.
