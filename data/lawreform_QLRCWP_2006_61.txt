possibilities: we ask for your ideas
The Queensland Law Reform Commission wants your comments, ideas and
suggestions. We are reviewing the role that confidentiality plays
guardianship system and are considering whether the law could be improved. We
want your help to:
• Identify the important points for the Commission to consider.
• Find out how the guardianship laws work in practice, including what
causes problems.
• Suggest how the guardianship laws could be improved.
• Develop and test our proposed recommendations.
As part of seeking your comments, ideas and suggestions, the Commission will
hold a number of public forums in different parts of
the State. Details of the
Commission’s public consultation process, including information about
dates, venues and times for
public forums, will be posted on the
Commission’s guardianship website, and advertised widely.

guardianship laws and our review
Introducing
the Guardianship Review
Queensland has two laws about guardianship: the
Guardianship and
Administration Act 2000
Powers of Attorney Act 1998
guardianship laws apply to adults (people 18 years or older) who are unable to
make some or all of their decisions.
The laws call this having ‘impaired capacity’. Someone has
impaired capacity if they cannot go through the process of
reaching their own
decision (free from inappropriate influence), having understood what that
decision will mean for them, and then
communicate that decision. Impaired
capacity can be caused by dementia, intellectual disability, acquired brain
injury or damage,
mental illness or an inability to communicate in some way, for
example, because a person is in a coma.
While a person may have impaired capacity for some types of decisions, such
as what financial investment strategy to put in place,
they may be able to make
other decisions, such as where they will live.
The Attorney-General has asked us, the Queensland Law Reform Commission, to
review the guardianship laws. The Commission, which is
independent of the
Queensland Government, will report to the Attorney-General in three stages. We
will review:
1. The confidentiality provisions of the guardianship laws. The final report
on confidentiality will be completed by March 2007.
2. The guardianship laws’ General Principles. These are the guidelines
for decision-making under the guardianship laws. An
interim report on the
General Principles will be released in September 2007.
3. Queensland’s guardianship laws more generally. The
Commission’s final guardianship report is due in December 2008.
At each of these stages, we will consult with you to get your ideas. Once we
have done our research and listened to your ideas, we
will write a report with
recommendations about how the Queensland Government might improve the
guardianship laws.
Our questions on confidentiality
The Commission is currently undertaking stage one of its review:
confidentiality
. In this paper, we want to ask you questions about
confidentiality around five main themes. The first four relate to the
Guardianship
and Administration Tribunal. The last one relates to a general
duty of confidentiality imposed on people involved in the guardianship
1. Under what circumstances, if any, should the Tribunal be able to keep a
person out of a hearing?
2. Under what circumstances, if any, should the Tribunal be able to stop a
person involved in the proceeding from seeing documents
that the Tribunal is
considering?
3. Under what circumstances, if any, should the Tribunal be able to refuse to
give its decision or reasons for that decision to a
person involved in the
proceeding?
4. To what extent, if at all, should Tribunal proceedings be able to be
openly discussed by people outside those proceedings?
5. Apart from the situations referred to in questions 1–4 (which deal
with Tribunal proceedings), are there other circumstances
in which information
that is revealed within the guardianship system should be required to be kept
confidential?
Details about how you can be involved in this review are set out at the end
of this paper. We look forward to hearing from you on
this important
Companion Paper: its purpose
The Queensland Law Reform Commission wants to explain the guardianship laws
to many people, all of whom have different needs and expectations
of those laws.
They include adults who have impaired capacity, their families and friends,
carers, advocacy groups, service providers,
lawyers, and interested members of
the community.
To meet the different needs of so many people, the Commission has sought to
explain the guardianship laws and review the issues:
• Comprehensively in a detailed Discussion Paper, called
Confidentiality in the Guardianship System: Public Justice, Private
• Simply so that you do not have to be a legal expert to understand it.
This short paper,
Public Justice, Private Lives: A Companion Paper
been written as a guide to the longer Discussion Paper, but can also be read
independently of that paper.
• In pamphlets dealing with the key issues in the review. Two versions
are available:
Confidentiality: Key questions for people who may need help
with decision-making
Confidentiality: Key questions for families,
friends and advocates
• Visually and aurally on a CD-ROM called
Public Justice, Private
Lives: A CD-ROM Companion
. This is for people who need or prefer to see
and/or hear new information.
The purpose of all of these formats is to examine the confidentiality
provisions contained in the guardianship laws. In each format:
• A reference to ‘the adult’ means a person 18 years or
older with impaired capacity.
• The term ‘guardianship laws’ refers to both the
of Attorney Act 1998
Guardianship and Administration Act
• The term ‘Tribunal’ refers to Queensland’s
Guardianship and Administration Tribunal.
A glossary of other terms used is also included at the end of this paper.
Guardianship
and decision-making
Our decisions define us. They not only shape the practical course of our
lives, they also illustrate to others how we see ourselves
and what our hopes
and dreams are. When our power to make our own decisions is impaired or taken
away from us, our sense of self-hood
is also at risk.
For most adults with impaired capacity, decisions are made informally within
the adult’s network of family and friends. It
is only if a problem arises
that it may be necessary to formalise the decision-making process. This might
• the person wishing to make a decision on behalf of the adult does not
have the necessary authority to do so; or
• the authority of the person making the decision is disputed; or
• there is no appropriate person to make the decision; or
• the decision or decisions being made are considered inappropriate;
• a conflict occurs over the decision-making process.
The guardianship laws distinguish between decisions about:
Personal matters
, such as where we live, who we live with, where we
work, and what sort of lifestyle we have. Decisions for an adult about personal
matters can be made by a guardian – a person appointed by the Tribunal for
this purpose. This is called ‘guardianship’.
A guardian cannot
make a decision for the adult about financial matters. Decisions about personal
matters can also be made by an
attorney appointed by the adult under an enduring
power of attorney before they had impaired capacity.
Health matters
. Decisions about health matters relate to our
health care, such as what medical treatment we will receive. They are a type of
matter. Decisions about health matters can be made by the adult by
completing an advance health directive while they have capacity.
directive exists, these decisions can be made by an attorney appointed under an
enduring power of attorney, by a guardian,
or by a statutory health attorney
(who might be the adult’s spouse, unpaid carer, or close friend or
relative). The Tribunal
can also make decisions about some types of health
Financial matters
, such as day-to-day financial decisions (like
paying bills), buying and selling property, insuring property, making
investments and
entering into contracts. Decisions for an adult about financial
matters can be made by an administrator – a person appointed
Tribunal for this purpose. This is called ‘administration’. An
administrator cannot make a decision for the
adult about personal or health
matters. Financial decisions can also be made by an attorney appointed by the
adult under an enduring
power of attorney before they had impaired capacity.
Of course, in real life, the boundaries between personal, health and
financial matters are not so clear-cut; they tend to blur or

ardianship agencies: who they are and what they
Guardianship and Administration Tribunal (‘the
The Guardianship and Administration Tribunal is like a court but is less
formal. The Tribunal has the authority to appoint guardians
and administrators
for adults with impaired capacity and can give them directions or advice about
what to do. It can also make decisions
for an adult about certain special types
of health care.
The Tribunal works from the following principles:
• The Tribunal should only become involved when informal
decision-making is not working.
• Most adults with impaired capacity do not need a guardian or
administrator.
• The Tribunal’s main concern is the welfare of the adult with
impaired capacity.
The Adult Guardian
The Adult Guardian is an independent official who protects the rights and
interests of adults with impaired capacity. One way the
Adult Guardian does
this is by acting as guardian for an adult. This happens when the Tribunal
appoints the Adult Guardian in this
role. If there is no one else who can, the
Adult Guardian can also consent to health care decisions for the adult.
The Adult Guardian also investigates allegations of neglect, exploitation
or abuse of an adult.
The Public Advocate
The Public Advocate is an independent official whose role is to promote and
protect the rights of adults with impaired capacity.
The Public Advocate also
has other functions such as monitoring and reviewing service and facility
delivery to adults. Unlike the
Adult Guardian, the Public Advocate’s
functions are aimed at systemic advocacy rather than advocacy on behalf of
adults. This involves identifying problems with the systems in our
society that deal with adults with impaired capacity, and working
towards the
improvement of those systems.
Community Visitor Program
The Community Visitor Program promotes the rights and protects the
interests of adults with impaired capacity, and adults with a mental
intellectual impairment. It does this through a network of community visitors
who regularly visit the facilities where these
people live or receive
The Public Trustee
The Public Trustee is sometimes appointed by the Tribunal to make decisions
When acting in this
role, the Public Trustee is acting as the administrator of the adult.
confidentiality: the current
The law sometimes protects certain types of private and personal information
from being disclosed to other people. At present, the
guardianship laws protect
information as ‘confidential’ in three ways:
1. The laws protect the personal
information a person gains access to
because they are involved in some way with the guardianship system
duty to keep information confidential applies to, for example, members of the
Tribunal and its staff, the Adult Guardian and
Public Advocate and their staff,
and guardians and administrators. It also applies to people acting as
attorneys, including statutory
health attorneys.
Information of this sort is only protected as ‘confidential’ if
it could reasonably be expected to identify the person
involved. Information
can still identify a person even if he or she has not been named. For example,
the identity of a person may
be revealed if someone tells a story that refers to
2. The laws also stop people
publishing information about what happens
before the Tribunal
. This means information such as who was at a hearing,
what they said, what documents were given to the Tribunal, what decision was
made and what reasons were given for that decision.
3. The laws also allow the Tribunal to make
‘confidentiality
orders’ in relation to some proceedings
. These orders are not
commonly made but are very important because of their potential impact on the
people involved. They can stop
certain people from:
• attending a Tribunal hearing, or part of a hearing;
• looking at a document that is being considered by the Tribunal;
• seeing a copy of the Tribunal’s decision and/or the reasons it
gives for that decision.
balancing concepts in
confidentiality
Three important concepts influence our choices about how and when to respect
the confidentiality of information within the guardianship
system: the principle
of open justice, the requirements of procedural fairness, and the nature of the
guardianship system.
1. Open justice
Where there is no publicity there is no justice. Publicity is the very soul
of justice.
Jeremy Bentham
The principle of open justice requires that our courts (like the Tribunal)
should be open to the public. This includes, for example,
conducting hearings
in public. The openness required by this principle is at odds with
confidentiality.
The main purposes
Accountability:
acts as a safeguard against biased or arbitrary
decision-making.
increases public understanding of the law and how
decisions are made.
The five elements of open justice are:
that members of the public be allowed to attend
proceedings;
that those attending proceedings be able to
report to others what happened;
identification:
that the names of those involved in
proceedings, such as parties and witnesses, be available to the public;
inspection:
that members of the public be able to inspect
documents used in proceedings; and
that reasons given for a decision be produced and
made available to the public.
Whose interests are being protected?
Open justice is based on the interests of the public generally.
How open justice affects confidentiality
The principle of open justice favours decision-making that is open to the
public in the interests of accountability and public understanding.
Procedural fairness
Participation in decision-making … is one of the universally acclaimed
values against which it is hard to find a voice of dissent.
DJ Galligan
Procedural fairness is a legal rule that says everyone should have a chance
to present their case and comment on any relevant adverse
statements made about
them before a decision is made. It is unfair to decide an issue without giving
someone a chance to respond.
This means, for example, that a person accused of
mistreating an adult should be able to explain their side of the story.
Procedural fairness is a challenge for confidentiality because a person
cannot respond to information that is being used against them
unless they know
what that information is.
The main purposes
it is not fair to make a decision affecting someone
without their participation.
Better decisions:
decisions based on hearing all of the relevant
points of view are likely to be better.
Procedural fairness usually requires that people:
• know what information a decision-maker will consider; and
• be given an opportunity to respond to that information.
Whose interests are being protected?
Procedural fairness protects any person whose rights or interests may be
affected by a decision.
How procedural fairness affects confidentiality
Procedural fairness requires information to be provided to others as part
of giving them a fair hearing and so conflicts with confidentiality.
3. Nature of the guardianship system
By resort to such jurisdiction the court is empowered to protect the human
dignity and rights of individuals who … cannot protect
such dignity and
rights for themselves.
The protective nature of the guardianship system means that its whole purpose
is to safeguard the rights and interests of adults with
impaired capacity. This
includes protecting their privacy.
During a Tribunal hearing, and in the guardianship system generally, very
private information about an adult is disclosed. Just because
an adult needs
the help of the guardianship system, however, may not mean their private life
should then be made public.
The main purpose
Protection:
the guardianship system has a duty to safeguard the
rights and interests of adults with impaired capacity. This includes protecting
their privacy where appropriate.
Whose interests are being protected?
The guardianship system is intended to protect the rights and interests of
adults with impaired capacity.
How the nature of guardianship affects confidentiality
The guardianship system may prefer to keep information confidential if
disclosing it would harm an adult’s rights or interests.
The sting in the tail of confidentiality
But confidentiality in the guardianship system might not always be the best
way to promote the rights and interests of adults with
impaired capacity.
The guardianship system affects the fundamental rights of adults with
impaired capacity. For example, it can permit decisions to
stop providing
life-sustaining medical treatment.
Given the significance of these decisions, an adult’s rights and
interests may be better served by openness in decision-making
accountability that it brings.
do we strike a balance?
These three concepts – open justice, procedural fairness and the nature
of the guardianship system – are designed to protect
the interests of
different groups of people. Sometimes those interests come into conflict.
For example, open justice allows people to report what happens at hearings as
part of accountable decision-making. But is it fair
that an adult’s
private life becomes a topic of public discussion simply because they need help
with decisions that would otherwise
be made in private?
Similarly, procedural fairness requires that people be allowed to respond to
negative comments made about them. But what if that
disclosure could harm an
adult with impaired capacity, for example, by negatively affecting their medical
treatment or condition?
The question arises: how do we balance the protection of an adult’s
rights and interests and the promotion of accountability
through openness and
fairness? The law has to make compromises. One of the challenges of this
review is that people have different
ideas about what the law should do and what
the appropriate compromises should be.
Another issue to consider is the relationship a person has with the adult.
Although not always the case, it may be that the closer
the relationship between
the adult and another person, the more appropriate it may be to reveal
information to that person. For
example, information may more properly be
disclosed to people who are close to an adult than to members of the general
We ask you to think about these things when you consider the questions in
of this paper.
questions on confidentiality
The Commission is asking questions around five main themes. Four of them
relate to the Tribunal, and the last one relates to a general
confidentiality imposed on people involved in the guardianship system.
For each of these five themes, we have a short story that might help you to
think about the issues. These stories aren’t real.
We are using them to
try to show some of the issues that can arise with confidentiality. We know
these stories involve a lot of
conflict and so don’t reflect the majority
of cases in the guardianship system.
The Commission has also included its ‘early comments’ on each of
the five themes. These are not our final opinions on
what the law should be.
We are not trying to influence your views, but thought you might like to know
what we are thinking at this
stage of the review.
Each of the five themes the Commission is considering raises other issues.
If you want to think more about them, you might like to

the law and possible reform approaches in more detail.
people from Tribunal
Here we are asking, under what circumstances, if any, should the Tribunal be
able to keep a person out of a hearing? This raises
issues like:
• whether Tribunal hearings should always be conducted in public;
• whether the Tribunal should ever be able to hold hearings in private
or to keep a person out of a hearing; and
• whether the Tribunal should ever be able to keep information
presented at a hearing from a person who is involved in the proceeding.
short story
Marlene is a 31 year old woman with an intellectual disability. She lives
with, and is cared for by, her mother, Gwen. Marlene’s
cousin, Jim, who
is an accountant, lives next door to them. He was appointed last year by the
Tribunal as Marlene’s administrator
to manage an inheritance she had
Gwen, who has recently learned that Marlene is pregnant, says,
‘It’s impossible for Marlene to have agreed to have sex
with anyone.
She’s just not capable of making that decision’. Jim has been
charged by police with a sexual offence against
Marlene and the matter is about
to proceed to a Magistrate’s Court hearing. Jim says, ‘I’m
innocent. I’ve
never had sex with Marlene. She must have had sex with
someone else’.
Gwen has applied to the Tribunal to:
• end the pregnancy; and
• remove Jim as administrator on the basis of the criminal charges
against him.
Marlene, Gwen and Jim are the main people involved in the Tribunal
proceedings. Two members of the public who are unconnected with
the family and
a member of the press are also present at the hearing. Gwen is worried because
Marlene seems to be frightened of
Jim. Gwen is also embarrassed about talking
no one else’s business.’ Gwen asks the Tribunal to
conduct the hearing in private; or, at least, to exclude Jim from
the hearing.
Jim protests, ‘This is the first I ever heard of Marlene being afraid
of me’. He says he has a right to be there.
might the people in this story say?
‘I don’t want to be turfed out of a Tribunal hearing that
affects my rights. That’s not fair.’
‘If Jim is at the hearing, Marlene will get scared. She’ll
get all jittery and won’t know what to say. All this
embarrassing.’
‘I don’t want Jim to be there. He is scary and I think he
is angry with me. Mum tells me he shouldn’t be there.’
Member of the press:
‘How will the Tribunal be held accountable if it is allowed to
keep some things private or to keep some people out of its
does the law currently say?
Section 109
Guardianship and Administration Act 2000
Tribunal hearings are generally to be conducted in public.
section 109
also allows the Tribunal to make a confidentiality order
to keep people out of the hearing or to direct that all or part of the hearing
take place in private. The Tribunal may also prohibit or limit the disclosure
of information given at a Tribunal hearing to some
or all of the people involved
in the proceeding.
might the law be changed?
The Commission has identified four possible approaches for how the law might
deal with the issue of openness in Tribunal hearings.
1. Open hearings with no power to close them
Hearings would be conducted in public in all cases, with no exceptions. No
Australian State currently does this.
2. Open hearings with power to exclude the public or any
Hearings would generally be conducted in public but the Tribunal would have
power to exclude the public or any person from a hearing.
There would be no
restriction on who could be excluded. This is the current position in
Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and
the Australian Capital
3. Open hearings with limited power to exclude the public or any
Hearings would generally be conducted in public and the Tribunal would have
power to exclude the public or any person from the hearing.
However, the
Tribunal would not be able to exclude particular categories of people from a
hearing, such as the people directly interested
or involved in the proceeding.
This is the approach taken in Western Australia, the Northern Territory,
Tasmania and South Australia.
4. Closed hearings with power to admit the public or any
All hearings would be held in private. Power to permit the public or
particular people to attend a hearing might also be provided.
None of the
Australian States take this approach, but New Zealand does, where guardianship
proceedings are dealt with by the Family
Commission’s early comments
Open hearings are important because the principle of open justice and the
accountability that openness brings is critical given the
significance of the
decisions being made. Being able to attend a hearing is also a significant part
of a person’s right to
a fair hearing.
However, power to close proceedings to the public and to exclude particular
people should be available given the protective nature
of the guardianship
system and the private and sensitive information that is often discussed before
the Tribunal. Although such
a step is serious, some situations may warrant
At this stage of its review, the Commission prefers the second approach:
hearings should generally be open, subject to the Tribunal’s
exclude the public or particular people. That power should be guided by
specific criteria set out in the guardianship laws.

access to Tribunal
Here we are asking, under what circumstances, if any, should the Tribunal be
able to stop a person involved in the proceeding from
seeing documents that the
Tribunal is considering?
short story
Edward is an 84 year old man living at an aged care facility. He had been
living independently until a year ago when he acquired
brain damage as a result
of a stroke. Edward is also experiencing clinical depression and is being
treated by Padam, a psychiatrist.
Edward’s son, Peter, applies to the Tribunal to be appointed as
Edward’s guardian and administrator because he thinks
• Edward is unable to make decisions about matters involving a moderate
level of complexity; and
• Edward’s needs are not being fully met.
However, Edward’s daughter, Emily, is contesting Peter’s
application as she wants to be appointed instead. She says,
hopeless. What would he know about what’s best for Dad?’
The Tribunal has several documents to consider, including:
• a statement by Jo, a staff member at the aged care facility who looks
after Edward; and
• a report by Edward’s psychiatrist, Padam.
In her statement, Jo claims, ‘I overheard Emily yelling at her father
and being really aggressive. She is a real bully’.
Jo doesn’t want
Emily to find out what she has said because it might mean that Edward is taken
The report prepared by Edward’s psychiatrist, Padam, indicates that
Edward appears to have a fixed delusion that his son, Peter,
is trying to poison
him. Padam notes in her report, ‘Edward refuses to accept that his belief
is a delusion’. Padam
knows that Edward will feel betrayed and be angered
by her opinion. She is worried that his feelings will affect their ongoing
therapeutic
relationship. So Padam’s report states, ‘I am providing
this report to the Tribunal on the specific basis that it is
confidential’.
The Tribunal has to consider whether a confidentiality order should be made
might the people in this story say?
‘If someone is going to say these lies about me, I should know so
I can have my say and set the record straight.’
‘I’m worried about Edward. What if Emily finds out what I
wrote in the statement for the Tribunal and tries to move him
somewhere else?
That’s not good for him.’
‘My first priority is Edward and his depression. I know that if
he sees my report, he won’t trust me again. Then I can’t
get better.’
‘But this report is about me. Are you telling me that I
can’t even know the state of my own health?’
does the law currently say?
Section 108
Guardianship and Administration Act 2000
people involved in a Tribunal proceeding must be given a reasonable chance to
present their case. This includes being
able to look at relevant documents held
by the Tribunal.
section 109
Guardianship and Administration Act 2000
lets the Tribunal make a confidentiality order to prevent people involved in the
proceeding from looking at Tribunal documents.
might the law be changed?
The Commission has identified three possible approaches for how the law might
deal with the issue of confidentiality in relation to
Tribunal documents.
1. No power to
limit disclosure of documents to people involved in the proceeding
The Tribunal would have no power to make an order prohibiting or
restricting disclosure of documents before it. This approach has
adopted in the guardianship laws of any Australian State.
2. Power to
limit disclosure of documents to people involved in the proceeding but no
criteria to guide discretion
This is the current position in Western Australia where the Tribunal is
able to limit disclosure of documents to people involved in
the proceeding, but
no criteria are established for the exercise of that power.
3. Power to
limit disclosure of documents to people involved in the proceeding with criteria
to guide discretion
The Tribunal would be empowered to limit disclosure of documents before it
in accordance with specific criteria. This reflects the
current law in
Queensland and Victoria.
Commission’s early comments
Procedural fairness requires that a person be given an opportunity to deal
with, or respond to, adverse information being considered
by the Tribunal that
affects his or her rights or interests. The principle of open justice also
favours open access to documents,
as part of securing accountability in
decision-making and public understanding of the law.
However, in some circumstances, it may be appropriate to hold back
information from certain people, especially if the adult is at
risk of being
harmed. This harm might be, for example, a breach of the adult’s privacy
or it might be that the adult would
suffer retaliation because of something he
or she has said.
At this stage of its review, the Commission prefers the third approach:
giving the Tribunal the power to limit disclosure of documents
involved in the proceeding, but that power should be guided by specific criteria
set out in the guardianship laws.

great. He’s the best Dad anyone could ever have’.
After several unhappy years, Carmella and Allan decided to separate. This
was partly because of Carmella’s anger about the
way in which Allan has
been managing Stephen’s money. She has told Allan, ‘You are too
free and easy about it all.
You are not thinking enough about Stephen’s
After they separated, Carmella applied to the Tribunal to be appointed as
Stephen’s administrator. Despite Allan’s opposition,
Carmella has
been appointed. Stephen was not present at the hearing and so does not know
of the decision at the end of the
hearing, he asks for written reasons because he wants to appeal the decision.
During the Tribunal hearing, Carmella and Allan gave conflicting evidence.
In reaching its decision, the Tribunal made adverse findings

might the law be changed?
The Commission has identified three possible approaches for how the law might
deal with confidentiality about the Tribunal’s
decisions and reasons.
1. No power to make decisions or reasons confidential
The Tribunal would not be able to make an order prohibiting or restricting
disclosure of a decision or its reasons. Most guardianship
Australia, other than Queensland, have this approach.
2. Power to make reasons confidential only
The right to know the Tribunal’s
would remain, but
the Tribunal would be able to prohibit or restrict disclosure of its
for the decision. Queensland’s
Mental Health Act
takes this approach.
3. Power to make both decisions and reasons confidential
The Tribunal would be able to prohibit or restrict disclosure of both its
decisions. This is the current Queensland law.
Commission’s early comments
There is a strong case for people involved in the proceeding being able to
know the Tribunal’s decision and the reasons it gives
for that decision.
First, if a person doesn’t know what decision has been made and why, it is
very difficult to dispute (or
appeal) the decision. Second, the principle of
open justice supports the accountability that comes from public scrutiny of
and reasons. Third, a fair process generally explains to people why a
decision that affects them was made. These arguments are
significant in the
guardianship system because the decisions made are very important and can affect
the adult’s fundamental
However, the protective nature of the guardianship system might mean that the
Tribunal considers it necessary, on occasion, to keep
reasons or decisions from
the adult or other people, for example, to avoid harming the adult.
At this stage of its review, the Commission prefers the second approach: the
Tribunal must always state its decisions to people involved
in the proceeding,
but it is able to decide when to provide its reasons and to whom. That power
should be guided by strict criteria
set out in the guardianship laws.
do you think? . . .
Under what circumstances, if any, should the Tribunal be able to
refuse to give its decision or reasons for that decision to a person
involved in
the proceeding, and why?

What other ways to tackle this issue do you suggest?
Publicising
Tribunal proceedings
Here we are asking, to what extent, if at all, should Tribunal proceedings be
able to be openly discussed by people outside those
proceedings? This raises
issues like:
• whether people should be able to discuss or publish information about
Tribunal proceedings outside the Tribunal and, if so,
to whom; and
• whether the identity of people involved in Tribunal proceedings
should be kept confidential.
short story
Li is a 54 year old man with Alzheimer’s disease who is now unable to
manage his financial affairs. A former self-employed
businessman in the
telecommunications industry, Li is quite wealthy. He lives with his 42 year old
wife, Justine, who has applied
to the Tribunal seeking to be appointed as
Li’s administrator.
Li’s 25 year old daughter, Mei-Ching, works as a clerk for a small
suburban law firm. She has also applied to be appointed
administrator. She believes Justine has tricked Li into giving Justine large
sums of money in the past and is worried
she will continue to use Li’s
money for her own ends. ‘I don’t trust her. She only married Dad
for his money.’
Justine denies this and also claims that
Mei-Ching’s interest is mainly financial. ‘She is just worried
inheritance.’
Li, Justine, and Mei-Ching are the main people involved in the Tribunal
proceeding, which results in Justine being appointed as Li’s
administrator.
Mei-Ching, who is tearful about the Tribunal’s decision, wants the
story to be made public, ‘This is devastating. I’m
daughter!’ She approaches a television reporter and camera-man outside
the Tribunal with her story. Mei-Ching’s
interview is broadcast although
her face is obscured and no identifying information is provided. Mei-Ching also
wants to get legal
advice to appeal the Tribunal’s decision. ‘The
law firm I work for will look after me.’
Justine is opposed to any public reporting of the story. ‘It’s
wrong for Mei-Ching to be giving interviews to the media.
This is a private
family matter. It’s no one else’s business. Li has always been
discreet and I see no reason why
we shouldn’t continue to respect his
and her neighbour.

‘I have the right to tell my story. People should know what is
going on here.’

‘Freedom of the press is crucial to a democratic society. Who
else is going to hold this Tribunal accountable?’

does the law currently say?
Section 112
Guardianship and Administration Act 2000
• publishing information about a Tribunal proceeding; and
• revealing the identity of a person involved in a Tribunal
proceeding.
There is some uncertainty in the law about whether ‘publishing’
information about proceedings means discussing it with
publicising it to a large number of people or the general public.
Section 109
Guardianship and Administration Act 2000
the Tribunal make a confidentiality order to keep certain information and
documents it has received confidential from members
of the public.
might the law be changed?
The Commission has identified four possible approaches for how the law might
deal with the issue of people publishing information
including the identities of the people involved, outside those proceedings.
1. No ban but power to order that information, including a
person’s identity, not be published
Publishing information about proceedings, including identifying
information, would be generally allowed, unless the Tribunal ordered
information must not be published. No State in Australia currently uses this
2. Blanket ban with power to permit publication of de-identified
information
Information about Tribunal proceedings could not be published but the
Tribunal could permit publication that does not identify the
people involved.
In this approach, the most that may ever be published is a report in which
no-one can be identified. This approach
is used in the Northern Territory and
South Australia.
3. Blanket ban with power to permit publication of all
information
This is the same approach as number 2 above, except the Tribunal has power
to allow wider publication. It could permit the publication
of all information
Queensland.
4. Ban only on disclosing identifying information without
Tribunal’s permission
Information about proceedings could be published provided the information
does not identify the people involved. But the Tribunal
would also have power
to permit the publication of that identifying information. This is the approach
in the Australian Capital
Territory, New South Wales, Tasmania and Western
Commission’s early comments
The principle of open justice favours public discussion and reporting of
Tribunal proceedings. This public scrutiny ensures accountability
decision-making and wider community understanding of the law and how it
operates. However, the nature of the guardianship system
may favour protecting
personal and sensitive information about an adult and people close to the adult,
especially if the publicity
could harm the adult.
At this stage of its review, the Commission prefers the fourth approach:
publication of Tribunal proceedings should be allowed but
only in a way that
does not identify the people involved, unless the Tribunal permits the
publication of that identifying information.
do you think? . . .
To what extent, if at all, should Tribunal proceedings be able
to be openly discussed by people outside those proceedings, and why?
What limits, if any, should there be on disclosing the identity
of a person involved in Tribunal proceedings, and why?
Should any ban on publishing information relate to telling that
information to a single person or only to telling it to a large
group of people
such as the general public (for example, by the media)?
Which of the approaches should the law take, and why?
What other ways to tackle this issue do you suggest?
general duty of confidentiality in the guardianship
Here we are asking, apart from the situations discussed above (which deal
with confidentiality in relation to Tribunal proceedings),
when should
information that is revealed within the guardianship system be required to be
kept confidential? This raises issues
• whether personal information that is gained by someone when acting
under the guardianship laws should be kept confidential;
• whether someone who gains this information should ever be able to
reveal it to another person or body.
short story
Olga is a 78 year old woman with dementia. She lives with her daughter,
Laura, and has another daughter, Sue, who lives around the
corner. Laura has
been Olga’s primary carer for many years. Olga’s daughters have
always cooperated in decisions involving
their mother which has pleased Olga.
‘We’ve muddled along very well all these years by talking things out
open-hearted to each other.’
However, Olga’s daughters recently disagreed strongly about a proposed
change to Olga’s medication. An application was
brought to the Tribunal,
which appointed the Adult Guardian as Olga’s guardian, with the agreement
of the children. The Adult
Guardian has told Laura and Sue, ‘I will make
a decision about the proposed change in Olga’s medication based on advice
that I have received from Olga’s GP and from a specialist doctor’.
Laura and Sue want to see this information.
Olga’s estranged brother, Bastian, also wants to satisfy his curiosity
He and Olga fell
out with each other about twenty years ago.
Now that the Adult Guardian has been appointed, Laura and Sue are also unsure
whether they are allowed to tell anyone (including their
Uncle Bastian)
information they already have about Olga’s medical history.
might the people in this story say?
‘It all feels a bit bureaucratic. How does the Adult Guardian
really know what’s right for Mum? We have looked after
her all these
years and we know what she wants. Why can’t the Adult Guardian just give
Sue and me the information?’
‘I want to do what’s best for Mum – I know she
certainly wouldn’t want Uncle Bastian knowing about her dementia.
what do I say if he asks me about it?’
‘I’ve not been a very good brother, I know that. I guess I
just want to make sure that any decisions take into account
childhood difficulties. Our family has a medical history that needs to be
considered.’
does the law currently say?
Powers of Attorney Act 1998
section 249
Guardianship and Administration Act 2000
aim to keep certain information
confidential when it is gained by people acting under the guardianship laws.
This includes people
such as attorneys, guardians and administrators, Tribunal
members and staff, the Adult Guardian and staff, the Public Advocate and
and community visitors.
However, both sections also have general exceptions, and allow a person to
record or tell confidential information if they are:
• acting under the guardianship laws;
• performing a responsibility under another law;
• involved in a court or tribunal hearing;
• allowed to do so by a regulation or other law;
• allowed to do so by the person about whom the confidential
information relates; or
• allowed to do so by the Tribunal in the public interest because a
person’s life or safety is at risk.
A further important exception is also provided for the Adult Guardian in
section 250
Guardianship and Administration Act 2000
exception allows the Office of the Adult Guardian to disclose information in the
course of its investigations if it is ‘necessary
and reasonable in the
public interest’.
might the law be changed?
The Commission has identified four possible approaches for how the law might
deal with the issue of confidentiality of information
gained by a person when
acting under the guardianship laws.
No duty of confidentiality
There would be no duty to keep information about a person’s affairs
gained when acting under the guardianship laws confidential.
This information
may still be subject to other obligations of confidentiality under the general
law or, for example, under the
or the Government’s
information privacy principles. This is the position in the Northern
Duty of confidentiality without exceptions
There would be an absolute duty to keep information about a person’s
affairs that is gained when acting under the guardianship
laws confidential.
There would be no exceptions for when this information could be disclosed. None
of the States in Australia adopt
this approach.
Duty of confidentiality with general exceptions
There would be a duty of confidentiality but with some general exceptions
(perhaps like the ones discussed above) that would allow
information to be
disclosed in appropriate circumstances. This approach is taken in New South
Wales, Victoria, South Australia and
Western Australia.
Duty of confidentiality with specific exceptions for the Adult Guardian (with or
without other general exceptions)
This is the same as the duty in number 3 above, but there would also be
specific exceptions that would allow the Adult Guardian to
disclose confidential
information in certain circumstances. This is the current position in
Queensland and is also reflected in
the Australian Capital Territory and
Commission’s early comments
The protective nature of the guardianship system may mean that personal
information gained when a person is acting under the guardianship
laws should
remain confidential. Telling others about information that was only revealed
for a limited purpose disregards an adult’s
however, might require this information to be disclosed. Giving a person a fair
hearing before making
a decision that affects them means giving that person an
opportunity to respond to adverse information.
At this stage of its review, the Commission prefers the fourth approach:
there would be a duty of confidentiality with specific exceptions
for the Adult
Guardian (with or without other general exceptions). The Commission seeks your
ideas about the content or extent of
the duty, and any exceptions.
Do You Think? . . .
Apart from the Tribunal, when should information that is
revealed within the guardianship system be required to be kept confidential,
Should there be any exceptions that allow a person to tell this
information to another person or body?
Which of the approaches should the law take, and why?
What other ways to tackle this issue do you suggest?
