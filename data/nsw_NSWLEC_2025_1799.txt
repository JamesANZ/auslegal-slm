they had reached agreement as to the terms of a decision in
the proceedings that
would be acceptable to the parties, based on the amended plans, as filed with

plans, additional heritage information and a schedule of
conservation works,
BASIX certificates, NatHERS certificates, additional acoustic information,

filed with the Court on 8 October 2025.
key amendments made to the architectural plans in the amended DA are as follows:

façade, so that characterful elements will be reinstated
to compliment
the original fabric and heritage status of the row;
(2) A reduction of the number of entries along the shopfronts to Botany Road;
(3) Altered access arrangements and internal layouts, to facilitate
façade amendments and the retention of more original heritage

original heritage building fabric;

considered an amendment to the DA, or would otherwise
require the lodgement of a
new development application;
(2) Remains appropriately described as alterations and additions to a mixed-use
development; and
