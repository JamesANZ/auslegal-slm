witnesses are listed at Appendix B.
2. Reserve Bank of Australia, Head Office Workplace
2.1 The Reserve Bank of Australia seeks approval from the Committee to
proceed with the proposed refurbishment of the Reserve Bank’s
Head Office
building at 65 Martin Place, Sydney NSW. The aim of the project is to prepare
the Head Office building for the Bank’s
next 25 years of occupancy by
ensuring the building is structurally, functionally and operationally viable
over the long term.
2.2 The estimated cost of the project is $259.7 million (excluding GST).
2.3 The project was referred to the Committee on 27 November 2019.

2.4 Following referral, the inquiry was publicised on the Committee’s
website and via media release.
2.5 The Committee received one submission and one confidential submission. A
list of submissions can be found at Appendix A.
2.6 On 14 February 2020, the Committee conducted a site inspection, public
and in-camera hearing in Sydney, New South Wales. A transcript
of the public
hearing is available on the Committee’s website.
Need for the works
2.7 The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is established by statute as
Australia’s central bank, and its enabling legislation
Bank Act 1959
(the Act). The RBA is a Commonwealth statutory authority
operating within the
Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act
(PGPA Act).
2.8 The RBA acts as a banker to the Australian Government and plays a number
of important roles, including; contributing to the stability
of the Australian
currency, driving full employment and ensuring the economic prosperity and
welfare of the Australian
2.9 The RBA’s Head Office building at 65 Martin Place, Sydney NSW, was
purpose built in 1964 on Crown Land, and has been continuously
occupied by the
RBA since that time. In its submission to the Committee, the RBA stated
It is a unique building by virtue not only of its heritage value but also its
highly secure function which is supported by an armed
guard force, purpose built
bank vaults, a data centre running national payments infrastructure, and
valuable archives. The majority
of the RBA’s staff (1,230 or 90 per cent
of the RBA’s current 1,371 employees) and key functions operate out of the
RBA wrote in their submission that ‘the majority of the central plant and
associated infrastructure in the Head Office
building has now reached the end of
its useful life’ and needs to be upgraded.
2.11 In addition, the RBA stated:
While the ongoing base building maintenance and fitout initiatives have complied
with the standards of the day and have achieved
a satisfactory work environment,
some building services have fallen behind current compliance and sustainability
standards, and material
improvements are now
RBA told the Committee that it is necessary to undertake a full building upgrade
in order to realign with current codes of
compliance, including the National
Construction Code 2019 (NCC). The RBA stated that ‘this will ensure the
safety of staff
and other building occupants by addressing items such as
non-laminated float glass, basement fire stair configurations and building
structure. It will also extend the life of the building for future generations,
and assist to preserve its iconic status and the
critical functions the Bank
performs for the Australian
community’.
Options considered
2.13 At the public hearing, the RBA told the Committee that as a result of
the review process it ‘settled on a whole-of-building
approach’ with
three broad options:
1 Sell the Martin Place land, purchase another site in the CBD, and construct
a purpose building. Estimated at approximately $450
2 Renovate the existing building by temporarily relocating the RBA to another
site. Estimated at approximately $500 million
3 Renovate and stay in situ while the renovations are conducted. Estimated at
approximately $260 million
2.14 The RBA told the Committee that the third option was preferred due to
being the most cost
2.15 In its submission, the RBA noted that while it recognised that the RBA
‘could sell and lease or build a new facility, this
approach was not
pursued due to the advantages of retaining the existing Head Office
The advantages
§ As the building’s heritage classification is closely linked to
its function as Australia’s central bank, retaining
ownership will provide
the best opportunity to preserve its rich heritage;
§ A number of the Bank’s highly specialised functions integrated
into the building, including high-security banknote storage,
data centre,
archives storage and currency museum, would be cost prohibitive to relocate and
replicate in another building;
§ Under the Act, the Bank is required to be located in Sydney; and
§ As a comparative cost assessment, selling and leasing or constructing
a new facility offered the least favourable value for
money option over the
long-term with costs far in excess of the options to upgrade the existing
2.16 The RBA considered three options with varying levels of structural
intervention to the existing building:
§ Option 1 – Retain Core
- Retain the existing building core and main passenger lift locations
- Total building NLA of approximately 24,555m2 (3 per cent less than
- No spare space
- Completion expected October 2025
- Capital construction cost is $244.6 million
§ Option 2 – Hybrid Core
- New external services core to the south with existing lift locations
- Total building NLA of approximately 28,290m2 (11 per cent more than
- Up to two floors of spare space
- Completion expected July 2025
- Capital construction cost is $259.7 million
§ Option 3 – New External Core
- New external core to the south including lifts (existing core
–including lifts - to be demolished)
- Total building NLA of approximately 30,065m2 (18 per cent more than
- Four floors of spare space
- Temporary relocation of 350 staff and basement 3 archives offsite for two
years during demolition works adjacent to Mezzanine, Level
1 and Level 2
- Completion expected November 2025
- Capital construction cost is $327.0
2.17 All options were reviewed and Option 2 was selected as it delivers the
least disruptive solution with the least risk to the RBA’s
during construction and is capable of retaining the significant heritage values
of the building. The RBA told that Committee
that ‘on balance, addressing
disruption and risk to operations and the importance of retaining the
RBA’s heritage were
deemed to be the more important
Scope of the works
2.18 The proposed scope of the RBA’s Head Office Workplace Project
comprises five key elements and includes:
1 New external services core – including mechanical and electrical
plant and equipment, services risers, fire stairs, toilet
facilities and a goods
2 Rationalisation and renewal of central plant – the majority of the
main plant and equipment is at the end of life, or no longer
compliant, so will
be replaced with new. Where possible existing central plant will be retained
3 Facade window glass replacement – the windows will be replaced to
meet current safety and energy efficiency standards
4 A contemporary fitout that supports flexible work practices to meet the
functional needs of the Bank. This includes:
a. Improving the ratio of meeting rooms, breakout and collaboration spaces to
better meet the needs of the current and future workforce
b. Connecting up to 10 floors by a series of internal staircases to encourage
greater connection between departments
c. Increasing its occupational work point densities to achieve the
Government’s target of 14 square meters per occupied work
d. Centralised staff support floor (cafeteria, service centre, multi-use
training rooms, library and a variety of staff support spaces).
Conferencing
will also be provided in a new facility on Ground Floor for meetings with
visitors and an upgrade of the existing conferencing
space Level 20 for staff
and visitors
5 New shuttle lifts – Replacing two lifts servicing the high rise
floors, Levels 16 to 20, which are at end of
2.19 At the public hearing the RBA stated that one of its key intentions was
to meet accessibility standards within the limits of
the heritage constraints of
the building, and had a ‘DDA consultant on the design team to assist with
making sure that we do
meet the accessibility
Consultation process
2.20 The RBA told the Committee that it had been through the standard
consultation process prior to the hearing which included providing
a briefing to
the City of Sydney Council, discussing the heritage aspects of the proposal with
the Department of Environment and
Energy, and meeting with the Hyde Park
Barracks ‘to explain the impact to the barracks’. The RBA stated
that all of the
briefed parties were supportive of the project and did not have
any issues with the
2.21 The RBA highlighted that it had offered a briefing to neighbouring
businesses, letterboxing an area of 75 meters from the Martin
Place property, of
which no one attended. Additionally, the RBA told the Committee that one
neighbour enquired directly regarding
the impact of the noise and vibration
during the construction phase, and was ‘satisfied that the nature of the
works wasn’t
going to impact their
operations’.
2.22 At the public hearing, the RBA stated that on the whole staff were
feeling very positive about the proposal. They further noted
that they had
consulted with the union, which was supportive of the
Heritage protection
2.23 The RBA stated in their submission that the Head Office building has
national heritage significance, as ‘a representative
example of a prestige
post-war government office building and is the work of the Commonwealth
Department of Works’.
2.24 The RBA noted that the Head Office building at Martin Place ‘is
included as a heritage item (Place ID: 105456) on the Commonwealth
List,’ and ‘the RBA maintains a Heritage Management Plan for the
building in accordance with legislative
requirements’.
2.25 The site is also listed as an item of local heritage significance on
Schedule 5 of the Sydney Local Environmental Plan 2012 as
‘Reserve Bank
including interior’ (item no.
2.26 At the public hearing the RBA told the Committee:
...the RBA’s ‘ongoing heritage management plan... is a key input
into the design of this project,’ and stated that
it will continue to work
with the appointed heritage consultant as it further developed the
RBA stated in their submission that the Bank’s Heritage Management Plan
requires the retention of the exterior façade,
Ground Floor foyer,
Governors and Board areas, and other areas with exceptional and significant
heritage value.
In addition, the
RBA stated that ‘...artworks and movable heritage furniture will be
unaffected by the proposed
Risk management
2.28 At the public hearing, the RBA told the Committee that the project does
pose a number of risks, including the construction risks,
risk of reduced
resilience’s through the construction period, the risk of losing physical
or information assets, and the potential
adverse effects on
2.29 The RBA stated that it would:
...be carefully managing those risks, both through the governance
framework...and by using the business-as-usual governance arrangement
bank has in place to support the day-to-day running of the
questioned about the management of asbestos risks during construction, the RBA
stated that due to a major asbestos removal
project in the nineties most
asbestos had been removed from the building ‘except for some known and
difficult to get to places,
mainly on the outside of the building in the
façade.’ The RBA told the Committee that it was aware of some
behind some electrical distribution boards, which it would be able to
sensibly remove.
2.31 The RBA highlighted that it had an asbestos register that would be
provided to contractors, and an asbestos management plan in
place which requires
any asbestos to be reported to the RBA, tested and contained prior to the
recommencement of
construction.
Cost of the works
2.32 Reserve Bank of Australia, Head Office Workplace Project has an
estimated cost of $259.7 million, exclusive of
2.33 AT the public hearing the RBA stated that approximately $180 million of
the total cost is attributed to the base building works
which it stated was
‘an investment in the base building to continue the life of that building.
Without that investment every
25 to 30 years, you would have to knock the
building down.’
2.34 The RBA provided further details on project costings in its confidential
submission and during an in-camera hearing.
2.35 The Committee is satisfied that the costings for the project provided to
it have been adequately assessed by the proponent entity.
2.36 The RBA told the Committee that an estimated 2,000 square meters of
office space is expected to be vacant on levels 17 East and
19 East which may be
rented out to the market on commercial terms if identified as being surplus to
the RBAs needs.
2.37 At the public hearing the RBA stated that currently and historically the
RBA had been leasing two floors of the building to barristers,
and was currently
keeping its options open regarding future needs of the
2.38 In response to being asked if subleasing to outside tenants added to the
RBA’s security costs, the RBA stated that it did
not believe so as it
already has an armed guard force and barriers at the entry to the building, and
vetted people prior to issuing
building security
Committee comment
2.39 The Committee was pleased to note the high level of detail provided by
the RBA, both its submissions to the inquiry, and at the
public and in-camera
2.40 With regards to the consultation process, the Committee commends the RBA
on its thoroughness, and was pleased to see the incorporation
of staff feedback
in the proposed design for the floorplan.
2.41 The Committee notes that under the
Reserve Bank Act 1959
core functions of the RBA are required to be located in Sydney, and appreciates
the benefits surrounding the RBA’s continued
presence in Sydney’s
financial district.
2.42 During the site inspection, the Committee noted the poor state of a
number of items cited for replacement in the proposed works,
including the
leaking windows and inadequate insulation.
2.43 In combination with the unique heritage value and the specialised areas
within the building, which include the secure banknote
storage and secure data
centre, the Committee appreciates it is impractical to permanently relocate the
Head Office building to another
site within Sydney.
2.44 The Committee is also pleased to note that the cost of the proposed
works will be funded by the
2.45 The Committee did not identify any issues of concern with the proposal
and is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of
need, scope and
2.46 Having regard to its role and responsibilities contained in the
Public Works Committee Act 1969
, the Committee is of the view that this
project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project
fit for purpose, having regard to the established need.
Recommendation 1
2.47 The Committee recommends that the House of Representatives resolve,
pursuant to
Section 18(7)
Public Works Committee Act 1969
is expedient to carry out the following proposed works: Reserve Bank of
Australia, Head Office Workplace Project.
2.48 Proponent entities must notify the Committee of any changes to the
project scope, time, cost, function or design. The Committee
also requires that
a post-implementation report be provided within three months of project
completion. A report template can be found
