This statistical report presents data on sentencing practices in Victoria in
the decade to 30 June 2024. The data includes the number
and gender of people
sentenced each year, the types of offences people were sentenced for, the types
of sentences people received,
and the imprisonment or detention lengths and fine
amounts imposed in the Supreme Court, County Court, Magistrates’ Court and
Children’s Court.
Key events influencing sentencing practices in Victoria
in Victoria is governed by a combination of legislation and common
The following are some of the
important changes to sentencing legislation and common law in the decade to June
2024. These are likely
to have contributed to some of the changes in sentencing
practices in Victoria during the 10-year period:
: suspended prison sentences are no longer available for offences
committed on or after 1
: the Court of Appeal delivers a guideline judgment in
in relation to community correction orders
: the High Court says that current sentencing practices should be
just one factor to take into account in sentencing, not a controlling
: some offences are classified as category 1 or category 2
offences, making a prison sentence presumptive or
: the Children’s Court Youth Diversion Service is rolled out
across Victoria
: some offences are classified as standard sentence offences,
requiring courts to consider a numerical sentence that represents the
the range of objective seriousness for the
: the maximum length of a youth justice centre order is increased
from 3 years to 4 years
COVID-19 significantly affects court
operations, resulting in fewer cases being sentenced, more serious cases being
prioritised, greater
sentencing discounts being given to reflect the harsher
conditions of prison, and enhanced guilty plea discounts being given to reflect
the value of guilty pleas in clearing court
Offence classification in this report
In late 2023, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics published an update to the Australian and New
Zealand Standard Offence Classification
(ANZSOC). The new offence classification
is applied to
data presented in this report. As a result, certain
offences in this report may be categorised and labelled differently from

Principal offence
principal offence
is the most serious offence in a case. Offence
seriousness is measured by the offence that received the most severe sentence
or, alternatively,

Principal offence type
principal offence types
are categories
of offences according to the offence types in the Australian Bureau of

For example, if a principal
offence is murder, the

is a homicide offence

Principal sentence type

most severe sentence type in a case according to the sentencing hierarchy in

total effective sentence will be either the same as
or longer than the
imprisonment length for the principal offence.
Supreme Court
In the 10 years to June
2024, there were 701 cases sentenced in the Supreme Court (Figure 1). The
offender was male in 623 of those
cases (88.9%), the offender was female in 72
cases (10.3%), and the offender was a company in 6 cases (0.9%).

Reading the data
Data sources
Council receives data on sentencing outcomes from Court Services Victoria. The
Council regularly undertakes extensive quality
control measures for current and
historical data. While every effort is made to ensure that the data in this
report is accurate,
the data is subject to revision, including in response to
publicly available sentencing remarks. The data in this report may differ
slightly from the data in previous
Sentencing in Victoria
Counting rules
This report presents data on the number of cases
sentenced in Victorian courts. For case data, the counting rule for principal
offences counts just one charge per case: the offence that received the
most severe sentence within a case (or the most serious offence
according to the
Australian Bureau of Statistics’
National Offence Index
if multiple
offences received an equally severe sentence). This counting rule is useful for
understanding the number of people sentenced
and how their most serious offence
is usually sentenced. The Council’s SACStat database includes the
prevalence of different
offences at a charge level (i.e. SACStat includes all
principal and non-principal offences).
This report excludes outcomes under the
Crimes (Mental Impairment and
Unfitness to Be Tried) Act 1997
(Vic), including custodial or
non-custodial supervision orders imposed for people who have been found not
guilty because of mental
impairment or found guilty at a special hearing, and
orders for unconditional release.
Although not classified as a ‘sentence’, diversion plans have
been included in this report due to the critical role they
play as an outcome
for people who become involved in the criminal justice system.
A box plot (also known as a box-and-whisker plot)
shows key points in the distribution of a series of numbers, including:
the median,
represented by the horizontal line within each box. Half of all values in that
distribution are above the median, and
half are below
percentile, represented by the bottom line of the box. This is the value that
25% of the values in the distribution fall
percentile, represented by the top line of the box. This is the value that 75%
of the values in the distribution fall below
interquartile range, represented by the rectangle between the 25th and 75th
percentiles. Half of all values in the distribution
are within this range.
Apart from some values, which are statistical
the full range of the
data (from the smallest to the largest value) is represented by the tips of the

extending from the box.

Fine amounts
In this report, fine data is presented in dollar
amounts. Maximum fines for offences are, however, set by reference to a
number of penalty units. Penalty units in Victoria are indexed
annually by the Victorian Treasurer, increasing from $100 in 2003–04
$197.69 in 2024–25.
