Gambling — An Update on Duty of Care in
The Productivity Commission report, Australia’s Gambling Industries
(1999), found that levels of problem gambling are of major
concern. According to
the report, around 330,000 (2.3 per cent) adult Australians have significant
gambling problems, and for every
one of these an additional 5 to 10 people are
adversely affected in a direct way by their gambling. A vital question one is to
is to what degree does a gambling venue owe a duty of care to its patrons?
While cases such as Reynolds v Katoomba RSL
[2001] NSWCA 234
(2001) 53 NSWLR 43
have recognised
that no such duty is owed, this article will discuss the extent to which
Australian courts are beginning to recognise
that a duty of care is owed by
gaming premises.
I Introduction
For many people gambling is a legitimate part of their leisure and recreation
activities. While most people who gamble do so in a
responsible manner and enjoy
gambling as entertainment, for some it is a cause of problems for themselves,
their families and the
community. Yet, what duty do gambling venues owe their
patrons? Generally, it is understood that no duty of care is owed to problem
gamblers to prevent them from suffering gambling loss. However, recent
Australian case law suggests that certain circumstances permit
a successful
claim in negligence to be established.
II When can negligence be claimed?
Some recent cases have addressed the issue of when a claim for negligence can
be made, namely
Preston, Foroughi
. In particular, the
courts in both cases left the door open for a claim to be made out successfully
in negligence for economic loss
incurred through gambling in an
‘extraordinary’ case.
While many cases are settled between parties, the question of whether
registered club owes a duty of care to a member who it knew,
or ought to have
known, to be a problem gambler, to protect the person against financial loss
from gambling, was considered by the
NSW Court of Appeal in
Katoomba RSL All Services Club
. In that case, the
plaintiff brought a claim against the Katoomba RSL Club to recover substantial
losses incurred while gambling
on poker machines on the Club’s premises.
Notwithstanding the fact that the Club was advised that the plaintiff was a
gambler and was requested not to cash his cheques or extend credit, no
steps were taken to prevent him gambling, and the plaintiff's
cheques continued
to be cashed by the Club. Spigelman CJ, Powell and Giles JJA unanimously held
that no such duty was owed.
Chief Justice Spigelman has observed that economic loss occasioned by
gambling should not be accepted to be a form of loss for which
the law permits
recovery, except in ‘exceptional
circumstances’.
Although, no
examples were given of circumstances when such a case may arise.
was classified as an ordinary case by Spigelman CJ, where a duty of care
should not be recognised as the loss occurred following a
‘deliberate and
voluntary act on the part of the person to be
protected.’
As a result, an
extraordinary case may occur when action by the venue operator reduces the
ability of a gambler to exercise control
over their own actions.
His Honour looked to authoritative statements of principle by the High Court

Spigelman CJ stated that the Court should be slow to recognise a duty to
prevent self-inflicted economic loss, as ‘loss of money

possibility that a claim of negligence in an extraordinary case may be
successful was left open as it was held that
‘whether a duty arises in a
particular case must depend on the whole of the circumstances, even in the case
of an inherent
Preston v Star City Pty Ltd
, Hoeben J permitted a claim in
negligence to proceed to trial because the allegations went beyond those made in
This case is an
indication that the Australian law relating to claims in negligence for pure
economic loss is still developing. The
claim in that case concerned negligence
and breach of statutory duty relating to losses of approximately $3 million
suffered by the
plaintiff in gambling at the Sydney Star City

it through the provision
of a cheque cashing facility, services and privileges,
liquor that was free of charge and that Star City informing the plaintiff

business contracts related to its procurement needs
promotions.’
Wood CJ acknowledged that a duty of care in this context might not ‘go so
far as preventing the offer of a limited
or reasonable range of inducements and
complimentary services’;
nevertheless, he stated that a duty of care may exist to prevent ‘the
provision of significant credit facilities or excessive
encouragement through
incentives, of a person who has specifically asked to be barred or to go beyond
a limit that he has asked the
In refusing to
strike out the claim for negligence, Wood CJ acknowledged that the Court should
be astute not to risk stifling the
development of the

in extraordinary cases and implies that

Kakavas v Crown Limited and John
refers also
to ‘extraordinary circumstances’ cites by Spigelman CJ in
In that case, a gambler has sued Crown Casino to recover
approximately $30 million in gambling losses alleging that he was induced
gamble at Crown Casino. The plaintiff alleged that, despite his access to the
casino being restricted by voluntary and compulsory
exclusion orders, the CEO of
Crown Casino ‘devised a scheme to the Plaintiff to recommence gambling at
the Casino’ and
requested Crown Casino employees 'to contact the Plaintiff
and to do what was necessary to induce the Plaintiff to recommence gambling
the Casino.’
The actions of the casino may very well fall within the category of
‘extraordinary circumstances’ and a duty of care found

section 78(2)
Casino Control Act
(Vic) combines two prerequisites of knowledge on the part of the
casino operator, or other person to whom the section applies. These
requirements
are, first, knowledge that a particular person is in the casino, and, second,
knowledge that the person is the subject
of an exclusion

(Vic) (‘the Victorian Act’) also make it plain that the
legislation does not confer a private right of action for

IV Conclusion
The defined categories that constitute an “extraordinary” are yet
to be seen. Nevertheless, it appears that excessive
inducements combined with
knowledge of the gambler’s problems, particularly if evidenced by an
exclusion order, may be adequate
for a [gambler] plaintiff to successfully claim
recovery of gambling losses, on the basis of a breach of duty of care.
