Head Chef, received 23 July 2021;
to the Adjournment Request, dated 3 September 2021; and
a copy of the Licence, granted effective by the Commission on the previous day,

9 September 2021, the Commission advised the parties that it would not exercise
its own initiative power under section 58 of the
Act to vary the Licence in
accordance with the Joint Proposal outside of the review process. The Commission
agreed to amend the Review
Application to incorporate the contents of the Joint
Proposal and the matter proceeded as the “Amended Review
Application”
from this point. See paragraphs
for further information about the Joint
Proposal including the Commission’s findings.
Accordingly,
on 10 September 2021, the Commission held a public hearing via remote
videoconference in relation to the Amended Review
Application (
At the Hearing, the parties confirmed that they did not intend to
“prosecute” the issue of the Commission’s refusal
to determine
this matter by its own initiative under section 58.
Reasons for
decision on review
making its decision on review, a key consideration for the Commission is whether
the grant of the Licence would detract from or
be detrimental to the amenity of
the area in which the Premises are located and whether the Licence should be
granted having regard
to the objects of the Act.
Whether the
grant would detract from or be detrimental to the amenity of the area
Applicants submitted that the grant of the Licence will detract from or cause
detriment to the amenity of the area in which the
Premises are located. In
summary, the Applicants made the following written submissions in support of
this position:
subject site is inappropriate for the proposed use, particularly due
intensity and scale of the proposed use with its proposed hours of operation and
outside seating arrangements; and
inappropriate level of traffic, light and noise given the function of the street
is a ‘lower order commercial street’;
Premises is more like a tavern than a restaurant;
Premises is immediately next door to residences;
residents are not aware of any noise attenuation works that have been completed
and there appears to be an absence of a sound
engineer report;
proposed hours will impact the environment, health, sleep and stress levels of
residents in the surrounding area considering:
maximum internal capacity of 49 patrons, but overall maximum capacity of
120 patrons; and
proposal to impose a requirement for a noise monitor and limiter be installed
was inadequate;
proposal will increase the already significant cumulative negative impact of
licensed premises on the area;
are concerns that alcohol will be consumed in the courtyard after 11:00pm, which
will generate noise;
will be generated from waste/rubbish disposal from the Premises;
Licensee did not provide an adequate alcohol, noise, amenity and patron
management plan.
Licensee submitted that the grant of the Licence would not detract from or cause
detriment to the amenity of the area in which
the Premises are located. In
summary, the Licensee relied on the following in support of its
Licensee is an experienced operator who has operated several licensed venues in
Torquay and Geelong over the past 15 years and
maintained an impeccable record
during that time;
Licensee has a thorough understanding of the difference between the
‘restaurant and cafe’ and tavern licence types,
having operated both
conditions of a restaurant and cafe
menu and employment of a high-end chef and an emphasis on food, with the service
of alcohol as an accompaniment, further supports
the Premises being a
‘restaurant’ and not a ‘tavern’; and
conditions on the Licence already protect the amenity of the area and reflect
concessions made by the Licensee during the process
of the Original Application,
where opening hours were reduced to allay the concerns of
The Joint Proposal
8 September 2021, a Joint Proposal was submitted by the parties leading to the
Amended Review Application. The Joint Proposal represented
an agreement between
the parties regarding suitable opening hours and conditions to be imposed on the
Licence for the Premises, which
the parties sought the Commission to endorse
pursuant to section 58 of the Act.
58 of the Act is as follows:
(1) The Commission, at its own initiative, may vary a licence or BYO permit
in accordance with this section.
(2) A variation under this section may include—
(d) the imposition of a new condition on the licence or permit;
stated in paragraph
, the Commission
determined not to exercise its own initiative power under section 58. Instead,
the Commission has had regard to the
contents of the Joint Proposal when
considering whether to grant or refuse the Licence the subject of the Review
Application and
any conditions on the Licence that may be appropriate.
make the decision on review, the Commission has considered the Joint Proposal in
the Amended Review Application to impose the following
condition on the
Outdoor Dining Area
No patrons are permitted in the rear area marked ‘outdoor
dining’ on the approved plan of 17 June 2021 after 10pm on any
save for the periods 27 December to 27 January and Easter Thursday to Easter
Sunday in any year.
For the avoidance of doubt, this condition does not apply to the
‘covered outdoor dining’ area on the approved plan of
the Hearing, the Commission invited the other Objectors to the Amended Review
Application to make a submission regarding the
Joint Proposal and received one
response from Mr McErvale on 15 September 2021 (see paragraph
Commission notes one concern that is apparent from the Applicants’
submissions regarding the risk of detraction from or
detriment to the amenity of
the area, which is associated with outdoor dining for up to 71 patrons
(according to the patron capacities
on the licence).
Commission finds that the Joint Proposal appears to represent a middle ground
Applicants’ concerns regarding the potential for detraction from or
detriment to the amenity of the area in which the Premises
are located,
particularly that which is associated with outdoor dining after 10:00pm;
Licensee’s commercial desire to trade during the hours permitted by the
Licence particularly during holiday periods when
trade noticeably
Joint Proposal provides that the outdoor dining area will be effectively closed
from 10:00pm for most of the year, whilst allowing
the Licensee to continue to
trade until 11:00pm inside. The Commission finds that this measure will reduce
any adverse impact on
the amenity of the area, particularly for those locals who
are permanent residents in the area and live near the Premises.
Commission finds that it is satisfied that granting the Licence, subject to the
condition proposed in the Joint Proposal, adequately
addresses the concerns
raised by the Applicants and the Objectors and that the granting of the Licence
subject to this condition
will not detract from or be detrimental to the amenity
of the area in which the premises are situated.
Whether the
Licence should be granted having regard to the objects of the Act
Applicants submitted that the Licence would fail to meet the objects of the Act,
specifically section 4(a) ‘
to contribute to minimising harm arising
from the misuse and abuse of alcohol...
’, however did not put forward
evidence or submissions to support this assertion.
Applicants submitted that they had safety concerns with the supply of alcohol at
the Premises and the ‘unlit’ surrounds.
The Applicants noted that
the surrounding laneways could potentially encourage undesirables to
determining the Review Application, the Commission has had regard to the objects
of the Act, and in particular, harm minimisation.
The Commission has considered
whether granting the liquor licence application the subject of the Amended
Review Application would
be conducive to, or encourage, the misuse or abuse of
alcohol. Having regard to the lack of evidence before it regarding the potential
for harm arising from the misuse and abuse of alcohol, and the Licensee’s
experience in managing similar licensed restaurant
and cafe venues in Torquay,
the Commission considers that granting the Application would not pose an
unacceptable risk that would
justify the Commission exercising its discretion to
refuse to grant the Licence.
Decision on review
Commission has determined to vary the decision of the Delegate and grant the
application for a restaurant and cafe licence, subject
to the conditions set out
at Appendix A.
The preceding
paragraphs are a true copy of the

The Act, section 157(3).
There is a typographical error
in the Review Application where the form is dated ‘08/07/2020’. The
typographical error
is evident because the Review Application was lodged after
the Original Decision was made by the delegate on 17 June 2021, for an
application that was lodged on 20 August 2020.
At the time Mr Towey checked
the VCGLR website, the Commission had not yet had an opportunity to review the
notification of completion
of building works and supporting documents from the
Licensee to make the licence effective. That notification had been received by
the Commission on 25 August 2021. The Licence was made effective on 2 September
The Commission was advised
that Philip Barry is also known as Philip Whelan. As Philip Whelan was an
objector to the Original Application,
his application on review is valid. Mary
Barry did not make any objection to the Original Application therefore her
review application
was not valid.
The proposed condition to be
imposed was:
Outdoor Dining Area: No patrons are permitted in the rear area
marked ‘outdoor dining’ on the approved plan of 17 June
10pm on any day, save for the periods 27 December to 27 January and Easter
Thursday to Easter Sunday in any year. For
