SOLICITORS:
Gathered Here Legal Pty Ltd for the applicant
[1] This is an
application by Cedric Ian Anthony Berenger (
) concerning his
deceased wife’s informal will dated 5 February 1970 (
is the named executor and sole primary beneficiary. Cedric and the deceased
) were married for over 60 years at the time of Evelyn’s
passing. They have two adult children together. Cedric is currently
[2] The Will is
an informal will. In particular, it is not properly executed. Whilst it is a
will that was seemingly prepared by
a firm of solicitors and looks like an
original, it is only signed by Evelyn on the second page and has what appears to
amendment (not of any substance and in a different pen to the
signature) in clause 6. Even though the Will identifies in a typed
name, occupation and address two witnesses (a solicitor and a secretary), the
Will is not signed by either of them.
Succession Act 1981
prescribes the
requirements for the execution of a valid will. Subsection (3) concerns the
need for two witnesses.
satisfied that it is not inappropriate to deal with this application on the
papers in circumstances where:
(a) an application for letters of administration on intestacy was advertised (at
that time the informal will the subject of this
application had not been located
and was thought to be lost with no copy of it available);
(b) the persons who might be interested in the grant of probate appear limited;
(c) there is no evidence that suggests that the estate is complex;
(d) the application, involving an informal will, does not raise any novel
questions of law.
provides that the Court may dispense with formal execution
requirements and provides:
may dispense with execution requirements for will, alteration or revocation
(1) This section applies to a document, or a part of a document, that –
(a) purports to state the testamentary intentions of a deceased person; and
(b) has not been executed under this part.
(2) The document or the part forms a will, an alteration of a will, or a full
or partial revocation of a will, of the deceased person
if the court is
satisfied that the person intended the document or part to form the
person’s will, an alteration to the person’s
will or a full or
partial revocation of the person’s will.
(3) In making a decision under subsection (2), the court may, in addition to
the document or part, have regard to –
(a) any evidence relating to the way in which the document or part was executed;
(b) any evidence of the person’s testamentary intentions, including
evidence of statements made by the person.
(4) Subsection (3) does not limit the matters a court may have regard to in
making a decision under subsection (2).
(5) This section applies to a document, or a part of a document, whether the
document came into existence within or outside the
[6] Accordingly,
a discretion to dispense with due execution arises where the court is satisfied
(a) there is a document;
(b) the document purports to state the deceased’s intention as to how,
voluntarily, the testator’s property is to pass
after death; and
(c) the document constitutes the will of the deceased; that it is to operate
upon death.
Is there a document?
circumstances in which the Will came into existence and was executed is sworn to
as follows –
(a) in 1970 Evelyn was 27 years of age, married to Cedric and then without
(b) Cedric had made a will in 1965 in circumstances where he came into the
marriage owning a property and wanted to ensure that it
passed to Evelyn on his
death. The married couple had little available money at the time and did not
consider it then necessary
for a will for Evelyn to be prepared;
(c) in 1970 the married couple were attempting to have children and that
prompted Evelyn to consult with a solicitor to have a will
namely, the Will.
[8] The evidence
further discloses that Cedric and Evelyn discussed their wills from time to time
and considered them appropriate
(albeit old). Both Cedric and Evelyn’s
wills were kept in a box containing important documents.
[9] Shortly
before Evelyn’s death Cedric and Evelyn had their wills out and were
discussing same with their children and their
husbands. Evelyn referred to the
Will as being her will. There were discussions about updating the wills given
their ages and the
Will was left out as a reminder to Cedric to have that task
attended to. Evelyn passed shortly thereafter unexpectedly.
[10] Cedric
thought the Will was in the box of important documents but could not locate it
there, nor a copy of same. It was thought
to be lost. Subsequently it has been
discovered amongst records held by a son-in-law who took the Will into safe
keeping during
a move of Cedric and Evelyn to new premises.
satisfied that the Will is a document for the purposes of
Does the document state the testatrix’s intention as to
how her property would pass after death?
[12] The Will
does so. The beneficiaries are identified.
[13] The primary
beneficiary is Cedric. If Cedric had pre-deceased Evelyn, her surviving
children (or children of non-surviving children)
would have been the
beneficiaries.
Is the document testamentary, only to operate
upon death and intended to constitute the deceased’s will?
[14] The Will
was professionally prepared and it is readily inferred that the document is
testamentary and was only to operate upon
[15] Whether the
Will was intended to constitute Evelyn’s will requires some further
consideration in light of the informalities
of the Will.
conclude that the Will was intended to constitute Evelyn’s will given the
evidence that:
(a) it had been regularly referred to over the years;
(b) it was kept with other important documents;
(c) Evelyn specifically referred to the Will as being her will, including
shortly before her death;
(d) there were discussions about updating that document given its age;
(e) no other will was made during her lifetime;
(f) Evelyn rebuked the family joke about everything being left to the Dog and
Cat Society.
[17] The Will is
also consistent with her marriage and at the time planned children. Cedric and
Evelyn remained in a loving marriage
until her death.
Testamentary capacity?
presumption of testamentary capacity does not arise in the circumstances of an
informal will.
The test for
testamentary capacity was summarised by Applegarth J in
satisfied that Evelyn had testamentary capacity at the time she made the
She was a young woman at the
time who would go on to lead a productive long life.
[20] The Will is
rational on its face given the circumstances existing at the time, and remains
Other matters
[21] In the
circumstances of this case I consider it appropriate that this application be
determined quickly and without any re-advertising
occurring (as required by
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999
(Qld)). Cedric is not a
well man. The estate is not complex. The children of the marriage support the
application and have advised
Cedric that they do not wish to contest the estate.
There is requisite urgency to the application.
satisfied that the declaration sought ought to be made and that probate should
be granted to Cedric.
