DECISION OF:
M. Tsui, Adjudicator
CATCHWORDS:
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING – whether annual general meeting is invalid if
held out of time.
Standard Module,
next annual general meeting for Sunny Ridge Gardens CTS 19295 will not be
invalid solely because it is held more than 3 months
after the end of the body
corporate’s financial year.
REASONS FOR DECISION
is an application brought by the body corporate seeking a declaratory order that
the annual general meeting (
) for Sunny Ridge Gardens will not be void
despite being held out of time.
adjudicator may make an order, including a declaratory order, that is just and
equitable in the circumstances to resolve a
dispute, about a claimed or
anticipated contravention of the Act or the community management statement
), or the exercise of rights or powers or performance of duties under
the Act or the CMS.
An application
for a declaratory order about the operation of the Act is also a
‘dispute’ even if there is no respondent
or affected person for the
application.
satisfied that this matter falls within the legislative dispute resolution
provisions.
The application
submitting this application, the body corporate has provided the following
background.
[5] The body
corporate currently has a dispute with the Retirement Village Operator (
) in QCAT. The RV Operator is apparently operating on a 100 year
agreement entered into at the establishment of the scheme. The
provides that the RV Operator is authorised to hold the powers of the caretaker,
committee and body corporate manager.
In 2023, the body corporate says it
terminated the agreement and since then, the matter has been with QCAT for
determination.
An interim decision was made on 28 November 2023 in which QCAT
ordered, amongst other things, that until the application is
determined:
body corporate is restrained from terminating the agreement;
RV Operator is excused and restrained from performing the functions of a body
corporate manager, caretaker, and committee under
the agreement;
body corporate may delegate the functions of a body corporate manager to The
Community Co.
[6] A hearing
with QCAT has now been scheduled to take place between 20–24 November
[7] The body
corporate says the AGM needs to be delayed until after the determination of the
QCAT matter. In particular, the body
corporate says an owner has submitted 2
motions to the AGM that would be required to be ruled out of order as they would
with QCAT’s interim decision. The 2 motions propose
body corporate does not renew the appointment of The Community Co. following the
completion of its contract on 30 November 2025;
Management Services Pty Ltd (the RV Operator) be appointed to investigate the
reinstatement of a body corporate fountain.
[8] The body
corporate says delaying the AGM until after QCAT has determined the matter will
allow owners to consider these motions
without conflicting with the current
interim orders. Further, the body corporate says QCAT’s final decision
will have implications
on the budget for the financial year, that is, whether
the caretaker will continue under the current agreement, or whether the
will be terminated in which case a new caretaking agreement will be
considered and budgeted for.
[9] At lodgement
of this application, the body corporate advised that the AGM is tentatively
scheduled for 26 November 2025, pending
the QCAT matter. However, the body
corporate has since advised that as the QCAT member is likely to reserve their
verdict after
the hearing, it is likely that a decision may not be available for
some weeks. On this basis, the body corporate requests that an
ended decision” be made as to when the AGM is to be held, pending
QCAT’s determination.
of the Standard Module requires an AGM to be called and held within 3 months
after the end of the scheme’s financial year.
This time limit exists for
several reasons, including ensuring regular accountability and enabling owners
to make decisions about
the operation of the scheme.
[11] The body
corporate advises that the end of financial year for Sunny Ridge Gardens is 31
July. This means their AGM must be held
on or before 31 October each year.
[12] The body
corporate seeks to delay the AGM for 2 reasons. Firstly, it says there are
owners’ motions that have been submitted
to the AGM which, if passed,
would conflict with QCAT’s interim order.
of the Standard Module provides that the person chairing a general meeting must
rule a motion out of order if, the motion, if carried,
(i) conflict with the Act, the regulation module, the by-laws or a motion
already voted on at the meeting; or
(ii) be unlawful or unenforceable for another reason.
[14] Presumably,
the body corporate believes the motions, if carried, would be unlawful or
unenforceable and therefore must be ruled
out of order. However, it is unclear
to me why the AGM should be delayed for this reason, or what detriment or
inconvenience would
be suffered if the motions are ruled out of order. If,
following QCAT’s decision, the motions remain relevant, the owner can
submit them (or an amended version of them) for consideration at a subsequent
general meeting.
understand that the outcome of the QCAT matter will also have implications on
the budget depending on whether the existing
agreement is terminated. Rather
than delaying the AGM, if the agreement is terminated, the committee could
convene an extraordinary
general meeting at which it may consider the engagement
of a new caretaker, and at the same time, raise a special contribution to
the cost of the new engagement if no provision has been made for it in the
At this meeting, the body
corporate could also consider owners’ motions that were unable to be
considered at the AGM.
[16] There is no
other reason given for delaying the AGM. It may be that the body corporate
wants to avoid the expense and inconvenience
of holding another general meeting
following QCAT’s decision. Given the uncertainty of how much longer
QCAT’s decision
may take, I question this approach.
[17] Having said
that, an AGM held outside the prescribed time limit is not automatically
invalid. To challenge the validity of an
AGM, an aggrieved party would need to
lodge an application and an adjudicator would need to make a finding, and order
that the AGM
is invalid. Moreover, the courts have said that insubstantial
procedural irregularities (like the late calling of an AGM) should
not imperil
the actions of bodies corporate or their committees where they are taken in good
Accordingly, adjudicators
have consistently accepted that an AGM will not be invalid simply because it is
not held within the legislative
[18] I note that
by the date of making this order, the timeframe for holding the AGM has already
passed. In the circumstances, I
am prepared to order that the AGM will not be
invalid simply because it is held out of time.
[19] The effect
of this order is not to give the body corporate an ‘open-ended’
period within which to hold the AGM, pending
the QCAT matter. I am not
permitting the body corporate to hold the AGM late, nor am I extending the
statutory timeframe within
which the AGM must be held. The order also does not
prevent an aggrieved party from making an application for the AGM to be declared
invalid on some other legal basis, or for the AGM to be held sooner. It is
simply a declaration restating the legal reality that
the meeting will not be
invalid solely because it will be held outside the legislative timeframe. To be
frank, the declaration is
rather pointless.
[20] Notwithstanding
this order, the body corporate should still act promptly to hold its AGM as soon
as possible. Given the uncertainty
as to when the QCAT matter will be
finalised, it may be that the AGM will need to proceed first and if necessary,
the committee can
call an extraordinary general meeting following QCAT’s
decision to deal with other matters.
