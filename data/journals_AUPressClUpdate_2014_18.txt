APC UPDATE | 12 September 2014
Summary of latest adjudication
Nikki Sutterby/The Weekend Australian
The Press Council has considered a complaint about an article which was
headed "Roo the day" in the Food and Wine section of The Weekend
Australian on
11-12 January 2014.
The Council decided that the statements about kangaroo harvesting in the
article were likely to be read as subjective assessments
by the journalist
rather than verified statements of fact. In relation to the methods used by
Macro Meats, the producer on which
the article focused, the Council concluded
that no significant evidence of inhumane or unhygienic processes had been
omitted. Accordingly,
the aspect of the complaint relating to inaccuracy and
unfairness was not upheld.
The Council decided that the involvement of Macro Meats in proposing and
sponsoring the author’s trip to observe its processes
amounted to a
potential conflict of interest and should have been disclosed explicitly to
readers. Accordingly, that aspect of the
complaint was upheld. The
publication’s subsequent disclosure in the online archived version of the
article was welcome but
does not eliminate the breach.

A recent example of the Council helping complainants
obtain a remedy without adjudication
The complainant said that an article published in print in one publication
and online in a sister publication had misquoted his views
on a matter of public
health research. They had been expressed in his capacity as president of a
relevant organisation.
The complainant had attempted to arrange amendments directly with one of
publications but he believed the discussions further confused
Accordingly, he then complained to the Press Council.
Council staff worked with the complainant and the publications to achieve an
agreed clarification acknowledging the error and clearly
stating the
complainant’s actual views. The clarification was published in print and
online, under a headline that included
the name of the complainant.
