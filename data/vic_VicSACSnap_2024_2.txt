Sentencing Snapshot 286: Sentencing Trends for Aggravated Burglary in the
Higher Courts of Victoria 2018-19 to 2022-23
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of
aggravated burglary in the County and Supreme Courts of Victoria (the higher
courts) from 2018-19 to 2022-23.
Adjustments made by the Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at June
2023 have been incorporated into the data in this Snapshot.
Detailed data on aggravated burglary and other offences is also available
A person who enters a building, or part of a building, as a trespasser and
who intends to steal, assault a person in the building
or damage the building,
or property in the building, is guilty of burglary. The offence of burglary is
aggravated if the person has
with them a firearm, imitation firearm, offensive
weapon, explosive or imitation explosive. The offence is also aggravated if
else was present in the building or part of the building and the
offender knew, or was reckless as to the fact. Aggravated burglary
indictable offence that carries a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment
and/or a fine of 3,000 penalty units.
It can be tried summarily in the Magistrates' Court if certain criteria
This Snapshot focuses on cases where aggravated burglary was the principal
offence, that is, cases where aggravated burglary was the
offence that received
the most severe sentence.
Aggravated burglary was the principal offence in 5.3% of cases sentenced in
the higher courts between 2018-19 and 2022-23.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic particularly in the 2020-21 and 2021-22
years. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced in the period after March 2020 may be lower than in other years
because the pandemic caused delays
in court proceedings
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases in that period and
therefore higher imprisonment rates than in
other years
prison sentences
may be shorter during that period than in other years to reflect the combined
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the
justice system and
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2018-19 to 2022-23, 455 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of aggravated burglary.
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
aggravated burglary by financial year. There were 94 people
sentenced for this
offence in 2022-23, down from 97 in the previous year. The number of people
sentenced was highest in 2018-19 (108
people) and lowest in 2020-21 (71
There were no people who received a custodial or non-custodial supervision

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an imprisonment term of
less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the discretion to fix
a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
years or more, the court must
impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.
Of the 407 people who were sentenced to imprisonment for the principal
offence of aggravated burglary, 320 were eligible to have a
non-parole period
Of these people, 268 were
given a non-parole period
