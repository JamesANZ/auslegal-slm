REASONS FOR
INTRODUCTION
1 The parties are the parents of three young
children, Child Y born 2007, Child X born 2009 and Child Z born 2012.
2 They are in dispute about the parenting arrangements for the children,
financial support for the children and the division of their
ISSUES IN DISPUTE
3 The following issues were in dispute in the
parenting proceedings:
(a) the allocation of parental
responsibility for the children;
(b) whether the children should live primarily with their mother and spend time
with their father, or whether they should live in
a shared care arrangement and
spend equal time with each parent;
(c) the extent of the children’s extra-curricular
activities.
4 The following issues were in dispute in relation to financial support for
the children:
(a) should there be a departure from
administrative assessment of child support so that the husband pays child
support to the wife
at the rate of $380 per week per child;
(b) should the husband pay all the private school education costs at C School
(“C SCHOOL”), private health insurance
and all out of pocket medical
and health expenses for the children.
5 The following issues were in dispute in relation to division of
(a) the composition of the asset pool,
specifically whether the following should be included in the pool of assets and
liabilities
for distribution between the
(i) the sum of $479,221 paid by
the husband to C School for prepayment of school fees;
(ii) the sum of $130,000 withdrawn by the husband in cash from Bank O account on
3 August 2020;
(iii) whether the husband’s PAYG instalment of $130,241 due 31
March 2021 should be excluded as a liability;
(iv) whether capital gains tax liabilities arising from the sale of Property E,
Property M, and Q shares should be included as a
(v) whether the wife’s withdrawal from her superannuation account made
6 June 2019 and September 2020 of $56,736 should be
added into the asset
pool, or rather reflected in the wife’s bank account balances in her
Westpac bank accounts and CBA bank
(vi) whether the sum of $470,000 unilaterally withdrawn by the wife from the
Westpac mortgage offset account, should be added back
as a partial property
settlement, in addition to legal fees paid by her of $346,241, or whether her
legal fees were paid from the
funds withdrawn, and whether or not the balance of
$124,000 was properly spent by her;
(vii) should the husband’s legal fees of $333,460 be added back into the
asset pool, or taken into consideration pursuant to
(b) should there be an equal division of the
parties superannuation entitlements, or should the wife receive a cash payment
husband to adjust the parties superannuation entitlements;
(c) should the husband’s asserted contributions at the commencement of the
relationship and his asserted post separation contributions
be accorded
additional weight;
(d) whether there should be any adjustment to the wife resulting from
(e) should there be any adjustment in favour of the wife arising from the
husband’s failure to properly make financial disclosure
during the course
of the proceedings
(s 75(2)(o))
(f) which of the parties should be entitled to retain the former family home
(Property P).
6 In relation to the parenting proceedings I have
determined that:
(a) the wife should have sole parental
responsibility for matters pertaining to Child X’s health;
(b) both parents should otherwise have equal shared parental responsibility;
(c) the children should live with their mother and spend four nights a fortnight
with their father during school term, together with
holidays and special
7 In relation to financial support for the children I have determined
(a) there should not be a departure from the
administrative assessment of child support for periodic child support;
(b) in addition to periodic child support as assessed, the husband pay the girls
private school education expenses at C School and
ancillary expenses, together
with all medical expenses, as sought by the wife and such payments should not be
credited against the
administrative assessment of child support.
8 In relation to the division of property, the non-superannuation asset and
liability pool as determined by me should be divided 60%
in favour of the wife
and 40% in favour of the husband and that the party’s respective
superannuation entitlements should be
9 I have also determined that the wife should be entitled to retain Property
P as part of her property settlement.
10 The reasons for my determination follow.
11 The husband is aged 53 and is self-employed as a
medical professional. The wife is aged 51 and works part-time in administration.
12 The parties commenced cohabitation in September 1998 or January 1999 and
married in 1999.
13 In 2001 the parties lived in S City whilst the husband undertook
professional training.
14 There are three children of the marriage, Child Y aged 13, Child X aged 11
and Child Z aged 8. The two older girls attend C School
and Child Z will
also attend for her secondary education.
15 Throughout the marriage the husband has worked full-time as a
self-employed medical professional. The wife worked as a health professional
from 1998 until 2003.
16 Between 2002 and 2017 the wife was employed as a manager and administrator
for the husband’s business. Throughout the relationship
the parties
maintained traditional roles in so far as the husband was the principal income
earner and the wife was primarily responsible
for the running of the household
and the care of the children.
17 During the marriage the wife had alcohol abuse problems. She has
maintained her sobriety for 17 years. The husband asserts that
the wife had
various psychiatric problems including anorexia. The wife concedes that she was
treated for anorexia when recovering
from alcoholism in 2003/2004 and that she
obtain help and has been in recovery since 2006. In March 2004 she attended an
clinic to assist her maintain her sobriety and to obtain counselling.
Both parties were psychiatrically assessed by Dr T in August
2019 and he
concluded that neither party currently suffered from any psychiatric problems or
required psychiatric intervention.
18 The wife also had periods of gambling addiction during the marriage and
subsequent to separation, although there was no allegation
by the husband that
she had diminished joint matrimonial funds as a result of her gambling.
19 In 2008 the wife was involved in a major accident, in which she broke
bones in every limb except her left arm. She required hospitalisation
months and was left with lingering injuries including a fused ankle and chronic
pain. She received a compensation payout
of approximately $370,000 arising from
the accident.
20 On 20 July 2017, the wife obtained an ex parte interim intervention order
against the husband, whilst he was away riding his bike
in Europe attending a
sporting event. The wife’s application for a final intervention order was
withdrawn in February 2018.
21 In September 2017 the wife ceased her employment as a manager and
administrator for the husband.
22 On 19 March 2018, the husband filed an Initiating Application seeking
urgent parenting orders.
23 The trial commenced on 22 March 2021.

PRELIMINARY MATTERS
28 At the commencement of the trial each party had
prepared lists of objections to evidence in the affidavits of the other party.
Fortunately many of the objections were resolved and those remaining were ruled
29 Queen’s Counsel for the husband frequently objected, primarily
during the cross-examination of the husband by Queen’s
Counsel for the
wife. All of the objections were dealt with and written reasons were not
required except on one occasion.
30 That objection arose on the afternoon of the third day of the trial during
cross-examination of the husband by Queen’s Counsel
for the wife.
31 The following exchange occurred:
Sorry? Unusual circumstances,
are they?--- ..... I don’t raise my voice all the time.
You knew, didn’t you, that yelling at the kids in front of Mr U in order
to get them to comply with your directions wasn’t
going to be a good look,
was it?---I don’t think - - -
MR JONES: Well, your Honour, I object to this because - - -
MR DICKSON: Well, he has - - -
MR JONES: No. Can I make my objection? Your Honour has read that part of Mr
U’s report, and it’s quite clear - - -
MR DICKSON: Well, perhaps the witness should be out for this.
HER HONOUR: Yes, okay. Could you leave the court, please, Mr Stanton? Just let
<THE WITNESS WITHDREW [2.35 pm]
MR JONES: Yes, I will - - -
HER HONOUR: Okay. What section or paragraph?
MR JONES: It’s – let me just get it, your Honour. It’s the
– because your Honour has already expressed about
HER HONOUR: What have I said?
MR JONES: I was looking at para 59, your Honour. And what Mr U says about this
is two things: first of all, that the behaviour of
the children was totally
unacceptable, and secondly, he then later refers to this in his report as an
instance where the behaviour
of the children, he says, was so bad that in this
situation, without his intervention – that’s Mr U’s
intervention
– this is paragraph 81 I was now looking at, your Honour, on
page 31, paragraph 81:
My request to Mr Stanton that he ask the
girls to help him clean the playroom, their dismissal of him, the futility of
his efforts
to ..... and a lack of support and direction from the
And then he reaches the view, he says they’re
over-empowered.
HER HONOUR: So what’s the objection?
MR JONES: Because Mr U – my learned friend is putting to the witness that
this would have erupted, and I’m submitting
that’s not a fair
question in the context where Mr U says himself – if you look at the last
sentence in paragraph 81
– that it was his intervention that controlled
the situation.
HER HONOUR: Well, I thought - - -
MR JONES: So it’s hardly a fair question to ask a witness what – as
a matter of speculation, what would have happened,
when it didn’t happen,
where Mr U has said - - -
HER HONOUR: I don’t understand. What was the actual question? Because my -
MR DICKSON: The question was, I said to him: you knew it wouldn’t be a
good look in front of Mr U - - -
HER HONOUR: Well, that was what my last - - -
MR DICKSON: - - - to yell at the children to get them to do what you wanted.
HER HONOUR: Well, that’s what my last notes were, and that’s why I
couldn’t understand what the objection was.
It says you - - -
MR JONES: Well, the objection is that - - -
HER HONOUR: Just a minute, please. My notes were:
You knew yelling at the kids in front of
Mr U wasn’t a good look.
And then you objected. I don’t understand the
basis of your objection to that question.
MR JONES: Really. The basis of the objection is Mr U said he totally controlled
this situation – being Mr U.
HER HONOUR: Well, yes, but at the end. And what is interesting is you’ve
MR JONES: No, no, he’s not saying that.
HER HONOUR: - - - directed my attention to that the interaction would have
escalated into conflict. I think that’s the whole
MR JONES: It could have .....
HER HONOUR: He said that the interaction would have escalated into conflict, he
suspects. That’s not the point of Mr Dickson’s
question, isn’t
MR JONES: No, Mr questions – he’s asking something else.
HER HONOUR: The father’s control of the children is by yelling at them,
and on this particular case what he’s putting
to the witness, rightly or
wrongly - - -
MR JONES: It wouldn’t have been a good look.
HER HONOUR: - - - is that it wouldn’t be a good look if he did yell at
them because that was the likely thing that happened
next. I don’t see
that there’s anything - - -
MR JONES: But that - - -
HER HONOUR: - - - objectionable to that question.
MR JONES: Really? Because Mr U’s giving expert evidence to you that there
was no possibility of conflict because Mr U intervened,
told the children what
HER HONOUR: But that’s a different question to whether or - - -
MR JONES: This is just speculation, your Honour.
HER HONOUR: Look, I’m overruling you. I’m allowing the question.
MR JONES: Could your Honour give reasons for that, please?
HER HONOUR: No, I’m not going to give reasons now.
MR JONES: Well, I might need them.
HER HONOUR: I will put them in my reasons.
MR JONES: Thank you.
HER HONOUR: That’s fine. That’s my practice.
MR JONES: I would like reasons for that.
HER HONOUR: That’s absolutely fine, Mr - - -
MR JONES: Jones.
HER HONOUR: - - - Jones. That is my practice.
MR JONES: Thank you.
HER HONOUR: When somebody objects to a ruling, I will put it in my reasons. I
don’t hold up a trial with unnecessary ex temp
MR JONES: No, but I would like reasons for that ruling, please.
HER HONOUR: That’s absolutely fine.
MR JONES: Thank you.
32 At the time of the objection I had and I still do have considerable
difficulty understanding what the actual objection was to the
question asked by
Queen’s Counsel for the wife. Doing the best I can, I understand that the
objection was on the basis that
the question asked was of a hypothetical and
speculative nature, as the husband did not yell at the children, as this was not
because Mr U intervened and took control of the children’s
unacceptable behaviour.
33 There was also a disagreement from Queen’s Counsel for the husband
first report.
34 I do not consider that the question posed by Queen’s Counsel was
objectionable in the sense that it was hypothetical or speculative
and nor was
it prejudicial to his client. In any event that line of questioning was not
answered by the witness due to the objection
made by his own Queen’s
Counsel and the subsequent questioning was rephrased into an entirely acceptable
35 Subsequent to the exchange referred to in the preceding paragraph,
Queen’s Counsel for the wife continued to re-examine the
husband and
phrased his questions about raising his voice in a different manner to the
original question asked. The latter questioning
was in the context of parenting
techniques used by the husband to manage the children’s behaviour.
THE APPLICABLE LAW
36 The standard of proof in
this case is the balance of probabilities (s 140
Evidence Act 1995
Section 140
Evidence Act 1995
(Cth) provides:
(1) In a civil proceeding, the court must find the case
of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the
balance of probabilities.
(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in
deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into
(a) the nature of the cause of action or
defence; and
(b) the nature of the subject- matter of the proceeding; and
(c) the gravity of the matters alleged.
38 The husband and wife relied upon their respective affidavits. The
affidavits exhaustively recounted the history of the parties’
relationship
both in regard to parenting, financial support of the children and the property
dispute. I have examined that evidence
and do not propose to repeat it in these
reasons. It is not necessary for a trial Judge to refer to every piece of
evidence or argument
presented during a trial.

It is not the duty of the judge to decide every matter

detail each factor which he has found to be relevant
or irrelevant, or to
itemize, for example, in the assessment of damages for tort, each of the factual
matters to which he has had
regard ... Nor is a judge required to make an
explicit finding on each disputed piece of evidence. It will be sufficient, if
inference as to what is found is appropriately
Credibility of Witnesses
Husband’s witnesses
41 The husband gave
evidence and was cross-examined by Queen’s Counsel for the wife over a
four-day period. He was clearly exasperated
with the process and was combative
and at times disrespectful. For example, on a number of occasions he pointed his
finger at Queen’s
Counsel and made a “windup” gesture and
effectively told Queen’s Counsel to get on with the cross-examination.
times he was not responsive, and at other times he was extremely precise. He
often sought to make a speech, rather than answer
questions. His answers to many
questions were tailored to his narrative and he did not make concessions which
were adverse to his
case, when clearly he should have. Such an example was his
evidence about the circumstances of him attending a bank to withdraw cash
$130,000, which he later placed into a Coles shopping bag and gave to his
mother. He did not see anything remarkable about attending
a bank to do so.
Similarly, his evidence about not having read his draft financial documents,
which he received in August 2020, until
January 2021, when reading the documents
would have alerted him to his tax refund of around $200,000, was similarly
unbelievable.
42 Many answers to questions were in accordance with his myopic perspective
of events. Examples of this were his unconvincing evidence
prepaid $479,000 to C School, without the knowledge or consent of the wife and
his evidence about the circumstances
of the voice recording, which was played
multiple times during the trial, and his asserted demeanour and control during
the incident.
I refer to both events later in these reasons. I do not consider
him to be a particularly reliable witness and he was often less
forthright.
43 The husband did not call any other witnesses on his behalf.
Wife’s witnesses
44 The wife was cross-examined by Queen’s
Counsel for the husband over three days. She responded to questions directly and
not equivocate in her answers. She was extremely candid and forthright and
at times very forceful in her answers. She also was exasperated
with the court
process and at times was disrespectful towards Queen’s Counsel. However,
her frustration and disrespect was
often in response to demeaning, personal and
entirely unhelpful questioning. Examples of this were questions about the
circumstances
of her general practitioner’s prescription of herpes
medication and her sexual relationship with a boyfriend. At one stage,
had to intervene to stop the personal and embarrassing cross-examination, which
had little to do with any evidence which
would assist determination of the
issues in dispute.
45 The criticisms of the wife’s evidence and demeanour in the
husband’s Final Submissions were not in accordance with
my impression of
the wife and her integrity. Much was made about her negativity towards the
husband and her supposed determination
to punish the husband. In the context of
the offensive questions she was subjected to, it is not surprising that she was
at times incredulous about questions asked of her. She was, quite
rightly, offended and outraged that private medical records relating
to problems
she had faced in 2002 and 2003 had been subpoenaed by the husband’s
lawyers and she was subjected to cross-examination
46 She was completely candid about her past struggles with alcoholism,
anorexia and gambling. She admitted to each of these problems
and did not
attempt to justify or avoid owning up to them. In the context of her having
maintained sobriety since 2003, which was
not disputed by the husband, she was
understandably angry and annoyed about questions about her historical treatment
in rehabilitation
facilities and attendance at AA meetings.
47 The production of her medical records some 5 to 6 years prior to having
children was demeaning and she did not hold back in making
her view known to the
court. Much was sought to be made about her apparent dishonesty by failing to
tell the family report writer
that she had a sexual relationship with a
boyfriend, rather describing it as an emotional affair. She was justifiably
feisty in her
response to that line of questioning and immediately conceded that
she had not told Mr U of the sexual nature of her relationship
interviews, although she had tried to do so on the phone a week later, but had
been unable to bring herself to do so.
48 Overall the wife impressed me as a candid, forthright and truthful
witness, particularly about answers to excruciatingly embarrassing
49 Ms YY, Finance Manager of C SCHOOL was called by the wife in the context
of cross-examination of the husband, about the prepayment
of school fees to C
SCHOOL. Evidence in chief was adduced by Queen’s Counsel for the wife and
she was cross-examined by Queen’s
Counsel for the husband. She impressed
me as a responsive and truthful witness and I accept her evidence.
Single Expert Witnesses
50 Mr U prepared two family reports. His assessments
are annexures to his affidavits sworn 1 August 2018 and 14 October 2020. He
his third affidavit on 1 February 2021 which clarified a
typographical error in his second report.
51 Mr U was cross-examined by Queen’s Counsel for the husband and then
Queen’s Counsel for the wife. Mr U is a well-known
and highly credentialed
and experienced professional, witness who is held in the highest regard and I
accept his evidence.
52 Dr T is a psychiatrist who prepared a psychiatric assessment of both of
the parties. His assessment is dated 22 October 2019 and
is annexed to his
affidavit filed 16 October 2020. Neither party sought to cross-examine Dr T. He
is also a well-known and well credentialed
professional witness. Dr T concludes
that neither party requires psychiatric intervention, but recommends, as does Mr
U that both
parties could benefit by reflecting on the relative contributions to
the complex problems in their relationship and critically self-examine
they could improve their approach to these problems. I accept his evidence.
Applicable Law
Family Law Act 1975
sets out the provisions relating to children.
Section 60B
sets out the objects
of the act and the principles to be applied.
Section 60CA
provides that the
Court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration
when making parenting orders.
Section 60CC
of the Act sets out how court is to
determine what is in a child's best interests by reference to primary
considerations
(s 60CC(2))
, the benefit to the child of having a meaningful
relationship with both of the child’s parents and the need to protect the
child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to or exposed to
abuse, neglect or family violence and additional
considerations
(s 60CC(3))
including any views expressed by the child, the nature of the relationship
between the child and each parent and other persons, the
past involvement of
each parent with the child, the likely effect of any changes in the
child’s circumstances, the practical
difficulty and expense of the child
spending time with a parent, the capacity of each parent to provide for the
intellectual and
emotional needs of the child, any family violence involving the
child or a member of the child’s family, whether it would be
preferable to
make an order which would be least likely to lead to the institution of further
proceedings in relation to the child
and any other relevant fact or
circumstance.
54 In applying the primary considerations, the court must give greater weight
to the need to protect the child from physical or psychological
harm from being
subjected to, or exposed to abuse next neglect or family violence
(s 60CC(2A)).
Primary Considerations
55 I will firstly address the primary
considerations.
The benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship
with both of the child’s parents
McCall & Clark
[2009] FamCAFC 92
McCall & Clark
”) at [109], the Full Court said:
[109] The Act does not contain a definition of
“meaningful”, nor does it provide any specific criteria to assess
how parents
either have, or should have, a “meaningful involvement”
in a child’s life. It does not give guidance to the interpretation
phrase “meaningful relationship”.
57 At [117] of
McCall & Clark
, the Full Court said:
[117] Bennett J discussed the terminology in
[2006] FamCA 994
and said the enquiry was a “prospective” one
which requires a court to evaluate the extent to which a meaningful or
significant
relationship with both parents is going to be of advantage a child
58 The Full Court said there were differing possible approaches to s
60CC(2)(a) of the Act. The Court preferred the “prospective
approach”, although the “present relationship approach” may
also be relevant.
59 At [118] of
McCall & Clark
, the Full Court defined both the
“present relationship approach” and “prospective
approach” as follows:
(a) one interpretation is that the legislation requires a court to consider the
benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship
with both of the
child’s parents by examination of evidence of the nature of the
child’s relationship at the date of
the hearing, to make findings based on
that evidence, which findings will be reflected in the orders ultimately made
present relationship approach”);
(c) the third interpretation is that the court should consider and weigh the
evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how,
if it is in a
child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular
child has a meaningful relationship with
both parents (“the prospective
approach”).
60 In this dispute I prefer the prospective approach.
Mazorski v Albright
[2007] FamCA 520
, Brown J at paragraph [26],
described a meaningful relationship as one “which is important,
significant and valuable to the
child” and the word meaningful is “a
qualitative adjective, not strictly a quantitative one”.
62 The parties separated in July 2017 in highly conflictual circumstances and
since that time, in the context of acrimonious and protracted
family Court
proceedings, the children have spent time with both their parents, apart from an
alleged contravention in November 2018,
in accordance with interim orders of the
63 The wife submits that there is simply no basis to suggest that the
children do not have a meaningful relationship with their father,
and indeed at
the assessment for the second family report interview in September 2020, the
husband reported to Mr U that the children
are settled with him and enjoy
themselves whilst with him. Queen’s Counsel for the husband was critical
of Mr U for failing
to conduct an observation of the girls with him, as he
maintained that the relationship between him and his daughters had improved
significantly because additional time had been spent together as a result of the
Covid-19 pandemic.
64 As referred to, in the context of the girls views, each of the children
reported that they wanted to see their father, with Child
Y requesting to choose
when to see her father, Child X reporting that the prospect of spending more
time with him caused her to worry
and Child Z advising Mr U that she wants to
spend time with her father but wants to spend the majority of time with her
65 In this case, the best interests of the children will achieved by them
having a meaningful involvement with both parents.
The need to protect the child from physical or psychological
harm from being subjected to or exposed to abuse
66 Neither parent asserted that the other parent
posed an unacceptable risk of harm to the children. They did however make
allegations
67 The husband asserted that the children had become overly enmeshed with the
wife to the extent that it was likely that the children
would become alienated
from him. There was also a theme throughout his case that the wife’s past
problems, alcoholism, anorexia
and gambling and his allegation that she had been
diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, which was not substantiated by
Dr T, compromised her capacity to parent, although it was not clearly
articulated how that would be so.
68 Despite that assertion, the husband’s proposal is that the children
live in a week about arrangement with each parent and
that his proposal for the
children to spend week about time with each parent minimises the effect of the
wife’s anxiety and
enmeshment with the children, which would allow the
children time to settle in into each parent’s care.
69 At the commencement of the trial, the wife sought orders that the husband
continued to spend time with the children four nights
a fortnight, however at
the conclusion of the trial, after observing the husband’s conduct in
court and the manner in which
he gave evidence, the wife varied her proposal, so
that she proposed that the children spend two nights a fortnight with the
together with holidays and special occasions.
70 The wife submits that the children require protection from their father in
the context of their allegations and perceptions of
him and their fear of him.
It was submitted on her behalf that a snapshot of the reality of his interaction
with the children, is
the audio recordings which were played in court.
71 The wife asserted that there were instances of family violence perpetrated
by the husband, and that the children are fearful at
times in his care. The
audio recording demonstrates the husband’s inability to control his anger
and Child Y reported to Mr
U, during the second family report assessment
that her father gets disproportionately angry in response to fairly minor
that he becomes very angry about small things, and that it
is difficult feel safe and certain about his responses.
72 At paragraph 55 of the second report, Mr U states that each of the girls
complained about the husband’s anger and volatility,
and spoke about not
feeling safe when in his care and conveyed a strong preference to be with their
mother which entailed a greater
sense of safety and security. Mr U, also refers
to Child X’s paediatrician, Dr EE, who had concerns about the
physical discipline of the girls, which were sufficient for her
to make a notification to DHHS.
73 I refer to the wife’s family violence allegations in greater detail
in my discussion of the relevant additional consideration.
74 The additional considerations are set out in s 60CC(3) of the Act. I will
now consider the additional considerations.
Any views expressed by the
and any factors (such as the
maturity or level of understanding) that the
thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the
75 The first family report dated 26 July 2018
addressed the views of each of the children as at that date. Child Y told Mr U
she was forced to see her father when she didn’t really want to go
and that two nights is already too much and she could not
conceptualise spending
more time with him.
76 Child X, then aged nine, acknowledged that sometimes she got on well (with
her father), that at times things went well, that she
was able to enjoy herself,
but that long periods away, without contact to her mother, caused her to feel
stressed and anxious. She
expressed her strong preference to be able to stay
with her mother and not to have to go back to see her father, because her mother
makes her feel happy and safe, and when she is separated from her, she feels sad
and anxious.
77 Child Z did not convey any particular apprehension about either parent but
echoed the sentiments of her older sister that her father
could sometimes be
mean. Although she did not convey any anxiety or genuine apprehension about her
78 The second family report dated 14 October 2020 also refers to the views
expressed by the children, some two years after the first
family report. Child Y
told Mr U that life was generally easier with her mother, she found moving
between the two parental homes
was difficult and stressful and that she would
far prefer to spend more time at the home of her mother and choose when to see
father. At paragraph 32 of the second family report, Mr U emphasised that
Child Y was not saying she did not want to see her father,
nor did she convey a
sense of being alienated from him. Rather, she did not approve of the way he
behaved, his choices, his actions
in relation to her and about the negativity
communicated by him in relation to her mother, and that made her less
enthusiastic about
spending time with him.
79 Child X’s preference was to spend more time with her mother, as it
was less stressful living with her and although she did
not say she did not wish
to see her father, the prospect of spending more time with him caused her to
worry and she was often worried
and anxious at his home.
80 Child Z told Mr U that she had a greater sense of belonging with her
mother, likes the greater continuity of care with her mother
and feels more safe
and secure in her mother’s home, and that she felt a bit scared,
especially at night, at her father’s
sisters. Mr U concluded that Child Z wants to spend time with her father, but
wants to spend the
majority of her time with her mother.
81 In terms of the maturity of the girls, as at the time of the first
interviews, Child Y was aged eleven, Child X aged nine and Child
five. The second assessment was conducted just over two years later when the
girls were aged thirteen, eleven and seven
respectively.
82 At the time of the second assessment, Child Y presented as an assertive
and forthright teenager who had views and wanted those
views known and at her
age, wanted to be treated differently by her father.
83 Child X presented as an obviously anxious girl throughout both of the
interviews. Mr U opined that the real issue with her, is
that Child X is an
anxious person and that her level of anxiety intrudes into most areas of her
functioning.
84 From his description of Child Z as a precocious five year old in the first
family report, Mr U did not comment about the level
of her maturity.
85 It is apparent from both family reports that all three children are,
regrettably, aware of and caught up in the highly conflictual
relationship. All three are acutely aware of the inherent dislike each of the
parents has for the other and perceive that
their father has a pervasive
negativity towards their mother.
86 The husband submitted that because the wife has over involved the children
in her views of the husband, and transfers her anxiety
to them, the
children’s views should not be accorded significant weight. For the
reasons expressed in the following paragraphs,
I do not agree with or accept
that submission.
87 In the second family report, Mr U, identified, in my view quite correctly,
that the parents did not talk to each other, do not
cooperate, do not view their
children from a single united stand and attribute the children’s problems
to the behaviour of
the other. In that context, Mr U considers it inevitable the
children will develop a split and alignment, which is likely to be amplified,
one parent is insensitive aggressive threatening and poorly emotionally tuned,
as the wife and children allege about the husband.
It is therefore not
surprising that the children express that they clearly and unequivocally wish to
live with their mother, with
whom they feel safe and secure.
88 Mr U, does not support the husband’s alienation theory, and comments
that given the girls ambivalence towards their father
and lack of other features
typically associated with parental alienation, he concludes that the
children’s difficulties with
their father is more likely of mixed or
justifiable rejection, and not alienation.
89 There is nothing in the family reports which would indicate that the girls
views, which have remained relatively consistent over
a two-year period are
anything other than genuine and that they have an age-appropriate level of
maturity. I intend to accord weight
to the children’s views, in
particular, those of Child Y and Child X.
The nature of the relationship of the child with:
(i) each of the child’s parents; and
(ii) other persons (including
any grandparent or other relative of the child)
is no dispute between the parents that during the relationship and post
separation the husband has practised as an extremely
busy medical professional.
The wife has been the parent who has been primarily responsible for the running
of the household and care
of the children. That is the lived reality of the
91 The roles of each parent has been reflected in the nature of the
relationship between the children and their parents. Both family
identify that the children have an excellent relationship with their mother,
with whom they want to spend the majority of
time. They feel safe and secure in
their relationship with her and that she is the parent who is able to better
empathise with and
support the children.
92 In contrast, the two older children perceive that the husband is not
emotionally attuned to them, he is negative and aggressive
towards their mother,
they do not feel he is able to elevate their needs ahead of his own, he is
intimidating, lacks empathy, insight
and understanding of how he treats them and
that they feel less safe and secure when with him.
93 Child X has reported to her psychologist, Ms FF, that she feels her father
does not understand the extent of her anxiety and cannot
support her at times
when her anxiety is heightened.
94 The husband does not accept the children’s perceptions of their
relationship with him and reported to Mr U that the children
are happy and
settled with him and that they require structure, routine and consistency and a
corrective emotional experience when
with him, resulting from the care of their
mother provides.
95 The description of the difference in the nature of the relationship
between the children and their two parents was apparent during
the assessments
for the family reports. Child Y stated to the report writer that she was very
close to her mother, and that they
did everything together, whereas her father
was not particularly nice to them, did not listen and did not really understand
made them feel. She reported that her father had many times commented
she was as big as a house
she was fat, which had hurt her feelings.
96 It was clear to Mr U that Child Y described her mother in glowing,
unequivocally positive terms and her father in unequivocally
negative terms. He
attributed her alignment with her mother as arising from her perspective of her
family being in conflict and in
competition, which has been Child Y’s
world in the four years post separation, if not also before.
97 Child X presented as a highly anxious child who is able to convey more
ambivalence in relation to her father than her older sister
Child Y. She stated
that she sometimes got on well with her father, at times things went well, and
she was able to enjoy herself
with him, although long periods away from her
mother caused her to feel stressed and anxious. She explained that she preferred
stay with her mother, not because of what her father did or didn’t do,
but because her mother made her feel happy and safe,
and when she was separated
from her mother, particularly overnight and on weekends, she felt sad and
98 The assessment of Child Z was that she appeared over empowered and
somewhat precocious, however she found time with her father
considerably easier
than her two older sisters.
99 Mr U concluded in his first assessment that the wife had clearly been the
primary carer for the three girls and that they were
emotionally dependent and
reliant upon her as their primary attachment figure, and that the girls depended
upon her for all aspects
of their health welfare and development.
100 In contrast to their relationship with their mother, the girls perceived
their father as
distant, peripheral, rigid and controlling.
101 The husband submitted that the wife’s over empowering of the
children and her influence over their relationship and attitude
to their father,
should be considered in the context of the relationship he has with the
102 As identified in the first family report at paragraph 83, the wife is
anxious about the girls spending time with the husband,
and their relationship
with their father and his capacity to respond to their physical and
psychological needs. Given the close and
dependent nature of their relationship
to their primary attachment figure, it is difficult to consider that the wife
would not have
had some influence on the children’s relationship with
their father. I have no doubt that her anxiety has had some impact upon
girls relationship with their father but, certainly not to the extent alleged by
the husband, which would warrant a change in
the existing arrangements to week
103 The husband has asserted throughout the course of the proceedings that
the wife has alienated the children, cannot let go of the
girls and as a result
they are emotionally enmeshed with her.
104 Mr U did not share the husband’s view that the wife had alienated
the children from him. I refer to Mr U’s evidence
during cross-examination
which is addressed later in these reasons.
The extent to which each of the child’s parents has
taken, or failed to take, the opportunity:
(i) to participate in making
decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child; and
spend time with the child; and
(iii) to communicate with the
Participation in making decisions about major long-term issues
in relation to the children
most significant issue about long-term decision-making pertains to Child
X’s health issues. I have addressed at length
the respective participation
of the parents in making decisions about Child X’s health in the context
of whether the wife should
have sole parental responsibility for Child X’s
future health needs.
106 Whilst both parents agree that the children should attend C SCHOOL for
their secondary education, the husband unilaterally decided
to pay $479,221 to C
SCHOOL, for prepayment of school fees, without the consent or knowledge of the
wife. This issue is referred
to in my discussion of the division of property
between the parties.
Opportunity to spend time with and communicate with the
107 Post separation both parents have actively
sought opportunities to spend time with and communicate with the children, and
was critical of the other in this regard. The wife was critical of the
husband’s conduct during the marriage and in particular
asserted that he
spent considerable time on weekends riding his bike and having holidays without
the family.
The extent to which each of the child's parents has
fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent's obligations to maintain the
108 The husband has provided substantial financial
support for the children post separation, including payment of school fees and
child support.
The likely effect of any changes in the child’s
circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from:
(i) either of his or her parents; or
(ii) any other child, or other
person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he
or she has been living
is not a relevant consideration, as the orders proposed by either party would
not result in the children being separated
from either of the parents. The
children have not lived with any other relative, other than their parents.
However, the proposals
of the husband would result in the children spending less
time with their mother, than they presently do.
The practical difficulty and expense of a child spending
time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or
will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations
and direct contact with both parents on
a regular basis
110 This consideration was not actively pursued
throughout the trial. The parents live within reasonable proximity of each other
there is no difficulty or expense which would affect the children’s
rights to maintain personal relations and direct contact
with both parents on a
regular basis.
The capacity of:
(i) each of the child’s parents;
(ii) any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of
the child);
to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and
intellectual needs
husband’s case was replete with references to the wife’s mental
health issues including alcohol addiction, eating
disorders and her gambling.
112 The husband asserted that the wife had been diagnosed with anxiety and
depression, borderline personality disorder, anorexia nervosa/bulimia,
alcoholism and gambling addiction.
113 The husband, despite not seeking to cross-examine Dr T, remained very
concerned about the wife’s mental state.
114 In his final written submissions, the husband submitted that the
wife’s anxiety about the children and her difficulty in
letting go of the
children are relevant factors and that the children require the husband’s
influence as a check and balance
to the vulnerabilities of her personality.
115 The husband did however, agree that to his knowledge the wife had been
sober since late 2003. The wife’s evidence during
cross-examination in
that regard was compelling. She said that she had maintained her sobriety since
2003 notwithstanding that the
husband regularly drank alcohol in front of her
and there was alcohol readily available in the household. She took exception to
line of cross-examination in the context of her maintaining pride in her
sobriety for over 16 years.
116 The wife in her reply to the husband’s written submissions took
exception to the statements in the husband’s chronology
referring to the
wife’s health difficulties as follows:
(a) there was no evidence that the wife was
diagnosed with anorexia and bulimia nervosa in 1987 and
furthermore:
(i) that allegation was not put
to the wife;
(ii) the husband’s own evidence was that he met the wife 11 years after
this time in 1998;
(iii) paragraph 2 of Dr T’s report stated that the wife’s history as
“she didn’t have a history of bulimia”
and he was not cross
(b) There was no evidence before the court
that the wife was “treated ... for ... abuse of prescription and illicit
on 9 December 2003;
(c) there was no evidence that the wife was treated by Dr GG for the period 2004
to 2009, and indeed the wife’s evidence during
cross-examination, was that
she did not see him for 2 to 3 years between 2003 and 2009;
(d) the statement “... six week rehab eating disorder Sydney – prior
to that BMI below 18” is vague and nonsensical,
and was not evidence
before the court;
(e) there was no evidence before the court to support the statement that
“on 8 February 2006 Dr GG notes wife admitted EDD
(f) there was no evidence before the court to support the statement that on
24 February 2006 Dr GG notes wife using speed to cancel
effects of feeling
low, and in particular:
(i) Dr GG’s notes were
tendered on behalf of the husband for the entries of 10 May 2007, 15 February
2007 and “possibly
August 2005”;
(ii) no entry was tendered relating to 24 February 2006;
(iii) it was not put to the wife during cross-examination that she used speed
“to cancel effects of feeling low” and
nor were any of the documents
tendered put to the wife to support that
proposition;
(g) the statement
“06/2006–07/2007” Outpatient ... including in-house with day
leave” was so vague as to be
nonsensical and was not evidence before the
(h) there was no evidence before the court to support the statement that on
3 November 2006 “medical notes say need to reduce
200mg” and the wife’s evidence was that around 2006 she was pregnant
with Child Y and had not been on Seroquel
for a long time;
(i) there was no evidence before the court to support the statement that in 2008
the wife suffered an “acquired brain injury”;
(j) there was no evidence before the court to support the statements that the
wife on 10 August 2008, “used Valium for two
weeks at the start of a
pregnancy – notes say you speed twice but told Dr GG will not use
Notes indicate OxyContin and Nexium at early stages of pregnancy”.
There were no notes tendered from the medical records of Dr GG for August 2008,
no other documents were tendered to support that
proposition and the proposition
was not put to the wife.
117 I accept the corrections to the description of events in the
husband’s chronology, as set out in the wife’s reply
husband’s written submissions.
118 I also accept the unchallenged evidence of Dr T as set out in his report
that the wife does not suffer from any psychiatric condition
unimpressed with the extent of the focus on the wife’s historical problems
and the link which the husband sought to
make between her capacity to parent and
past difficulties. That is particularly so as the wife has been the primary care
of the children
since their birth and has continued in that capacity post
separation.
119 In relation to gambling, the wife admitted she had engaged in gambling in
recent times, although she did not do so and leave the
children unattended. It
was also her evidence that the funds were from a bank account to which her
mother had contributed and she
did not deplete matrimonial funds. There was no
explanation how the wife’s gambling impacted on her current capacity to
for the needs of the children.
The maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including
lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the
parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court
thinks are relevant
120 The husband asserted that the wife had
significant personality vulnerabilities which adversely affected her capacity to
the children. During the first family report assessment he told Mr U that
the wife suffered from borderline personality disorder
and during the second
family assessment on 22 September 2020, he told Mr U that he continued to hold
concerns about the wife’s
mental health, notwithstanding the psychiatric
assessment of Dr T which concluded that the wife did not have the diagnoses
to her by the husband. The husband reaffirmed these beliefs during
his evidence and in particular he was affronted that the wife’s
questionnaire for Child X’s ADD diagnosis, as completed by the wife, had
been used to diagnose Child X. He complained
that Dr EE had used someone with
mental illness to diagnose someone else with mental illness.
121 The wife’s historical problems with alcohol and alleged eating
disorders are referred to in the previous paragraphs in the
context of the
husband’s allegations about the wife’s mental health and addictive
behaviours.
122 In terms of the wife’s anxiety and its impact on her parental
capacity, this was addressed by Mr U in both of the family
reports and during
cross-examination and is referred to in these reasons during the discussion of
the nature of the relationship
between the children and their parents.
123 Child X has a number of health issues, which were referred to in the
first family report. Child X was referred by her class teacher
to Ms HH for a
learning assessment, which included a cognitive assessment test known as WISC-V.
Mr U, at paragraph 49 of the first
report refers to the significance of Child
X’s visuo-spatial problems, which tend to result in higher levels of
anxiety for
the child. Ms HH reported features of obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD), generalised anxiety and Autism Spectrum Disease, which
required further
investigation by a paediatrician. Mr U commented that Child X did demonstrate
those traits, which was consistent
with her mother’s description of her
history of repetitive behaviour, obsessional behaviour and a diagnosis with a
developmental
coordination disorder.
124 Child X’s presentation, at the first family report assessment
demonstrated a pervasive level of anxiety, which had raised
the possibility of
Autism Spectrum Disorder. Mr U was of the view that
the tension, conflict,
split nature of her parent’s relating, and untenability of the parental
relationship would only serve
to further heighten this girl’s
125 In August 2018, Child X first consulted with Dr EE, paediatrician, in
relation to her anxiety and OCD. Child X continues to attend
upon Dr EE and
there have been significant problems with communication between the husband and
Dr EE. I refer to those difficulties
in my discussion about whether the parents
should retain equal shared parental responsibility for Child X’s health
126 During the adjourned period of the trial, the school raised concerns
in the discussion
The attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of
parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents
127 The respective attitude of the parents towards
the children and the responsibilities of parenthood are also referred to
extensively
in these reasons.
Any family violence involving the child or a member of the
child’s family
128 The wife asserts that the husband has engaged
in family violence, which the husband denies and conversely asserts there was no
corroborating evidence to enable a finding to be made.
129 As submitted by the wife in her Reply to the husband’s Written
Submissions, there is no need for corroborating evidence
prior to a finding of
family violence.
130 The wife has asserted that the husband has made threats to kill and
generally engaged in coercive and controlling conduct towards
her. In his final
submissions, the husband asserts that he was never charged with threats to kill,
however that must be seen in the
context that such threats were never reported
to Victoria police. Although the Victoria police records were subpoenaed by the
the records were ultimately not tendered on his behalf.
131 The examples of controlling and coercive conduct of the husband towards
the wife include:
(a) obtaining a duplicate sim card for the
wife’s mobile phone number without her knowledge or consent enabling him
calls and text messages intended for the wife, then subsequently
refusing to transfer her personal mobile phone number back to the
(b) bringing a contravention application in the court the first business day
after the alleged contravention of the interim parenting
orders made 2 August
2018 when Child Y did not attend to spend time with him on Friday 16 and 17
November. The husband refused to
compromise or withdraw that application until
the day of court, notwithstanding that make up time was proposed by the wife
even before
she was aware of or served with a copy of the contravention
application;
(c) opposing the wife’s proposed travel to Indonesia with the children in
2019, after he had proposed to take them there himself,
relying on the
wife’s alleged mental instability;
(d) refusing to attend upon Ms BB for counselling and blaming the wife as to why
he could not attend notwithstanding the unchallenged
evidence that the wife
remained willing to attend those sessions;
(e) unilaterally cancelling two private mediations scheduled with Mr JJ and not
agreeing to attend mediation until March 2020.
132 The wife also relies on the offensive text messages which the husband
sent to her, prior to her obtaining intervention orders
as well as his continual
allegations about her mental health and his conduct about herpes and the
wife’s culpability for infecting
the children.
133 In her trial affidavit, the wife refers to various instances of the
husband physically disciplining the children including the
(a) on Christmas Eve 2017 in the car when
Child X failed to put her seatbelt on correctly;
(b) on 17 January 2018 involving an incident between Child X and the husband
when Child X ran away from her father into the shower,
slipped and hurt her
(c) an incident on 18 January 2018 when Child Y told the wife that the husband
hit Child Z in the mouth;
(d) on 18 September 2018 there was an incident when Child Y rang 000 twice to
report her father had tried to take her phone and allegedly
tried to strangle
(e) an incident on 27 September 2019 when the husband and children returned home
from Indonesia and the husband discovered that a
light had been left on during
their absence. Child X reported that the husband had hit her repeatedly on the
back causing her pain
and to become distressed, which she reported to her
paediatrician Dr EE on Monday, 7 October 2019. Dr EE subsequently made a
notification
(f) on 30 May 2020 there was an incident when the husband was yelling at Child X
which was recorded by one of the girls and the recording
was played in court
during the husband’s cross-examination and played it to Mr
134 Unsurprisingly, the husband denied that he had perpetrated family
violence against the children. In relation to the incident on
Christmas Eve 2017
the husband’s evidence was that “I admit that I rebuke Child X for
refusing to put her seatbelt on
despite my requests”.
135 The incident on 18 September 2018 resulted in a police attendance at the
husband’s home with no further action warranted.
136 The husband’s evidence about the tape recording was more vexing. He
seemed to be confused as to whether this incident was
the spaghetti incident
referred to at paragraphs 94 to 95 of his trial affidavit or whether it was a
different incident. The wife’s
Reply to the husband’s written
submissions refers to a copy of the recording having been forwarded to the
husband’s solicitors
on 10 June 2020, identifying the incident as having
occurred on 30 May 2020. In his trial affidavit, at paragraph 94 the husband
acknowledges receipt of the recording and it did not dispute the date of the
recorded incident.
137 Irrespective of the nature of the incident, the tape recording was highly
illustrative of the husband’s interaction with
the children when faced
with challenging behaviour. During cross-examination, the husband admitted to
raising his voice but denied
losing control. The recording was played on
multiple occasions and I do not accept that the husband retained control of his
during the recording. The recording was an appalling management of
138 In terms of an adverse finding of family violence against the husband, I
am able to conclude that the husband’s harassing
and menacing text
messages forwarded to the wife, which are referred to in these reasons are
unacceptable and bordering on coercive
and controlling conduct. The relevance of
his conduct in terms of the wife’s order for sole parental responsibility
for medical
decisions pertaining to the children is referred to later in these
139 In terms of his behaviour towards the children, the husband has
considerable problems with his management of the children and
his capacity to
regulate his anger and behaviour during stressful situations with them. I do not
consider that would warrant a finding
that the husband has engaged in family
violence towards the children.
If a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the
child or a member of the child's family - any relevant inferences that
drawn from the order, taking into account the following:
(i) the nature of
(ii) the circumstances in which the order was made;
evidence admitted in proceedings for the order;
(iv) any findings made by the
court in, or in proceedings for, the order;
(v) any other relevant
20 July 2017, the wife obtained an ex parte Family Violence order against the
husband after he sent her a number of text messages
and made a number of
telephone calls to her between 4 July 2017 and 20 July 2017. Some of the
text messages are referred to in these
reasons under my discussion about the
ability of the parents to communicate.
141 On 11 December 2017, the wife received a text from the husband referring
to the possibility that he would not get his registration
renewed the next time.
The wife deposes that she took that message to be a reference to the ongoing
intervention order proceedings
and the impact which they may have on his
registration. Subsequently, on 8 February 2018, the wife withdrew her
application for a
final intervention order.
142 Subsequent to withdrawing the first intervention order, the wife deposes
to receiving various offensive and inflammatory text
messages from the husband
between 28 February 2018 and 18 February 2019. As a result of those text
messages, on 19 February 2019
the wife obtained an ex parte interim intervention
order against the husband. The application was withdrawn by the wife on the
that the husband agreed to provide a 12 month undertaking in terms of the
intervention order sought by the wife.
Whether it would be preferable to make the order that would
be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation
143 It is preferable that the orders which I intend
to make will be least likely to lead to further proceedings.
Any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is
144 There were a number of issues pursued during
the trial, which I will address, notwithstanding the lack of relevance to my
determination
of the issues in dispute. They are herpes, the wife’s
infidelity and the handover of the keys to Property H.
145 During the many years of litigation the issue of herpes has distracted
both parents and it was also raised during the trial. Regrettably,
the wife was
cross-examined about this issue in a most invasive and intimate manner. I fail
to see the relevance of whether the wife
had herpes prior to the marriage or
whether she contracted it by virtue of a relationship she had in the latter
years of the marriage,
has any significance or bearing on her capacity to parent
the children. The husband attempted to extrapolate that her evidence and
candour about this issue somehow impugned her credibility as a witness and
demonstrated that she was inherently dishonest.
I do not accept that submission
and refer to my findings about the wife’s candour and honesty as a witness
earlier in these
146 The husband asserts that the wife has herpes and that he is concerned
that the children are exposed to the virus and if they had
contracted it from
their mother, then they be treated in an appropriate manner.
147 The wife asserts that the husband’s conduct about this issue is
obsessive, a means to denigrate her and to involve the children.
148 In 2017, the girls had facial lesions, which the husband considered could
have been herpes. The wife’s evidence during cross-examination
Child X did not have any facial lesions, Child Y had a cold and a runny nose for
a few days with raw skin under her nose
from blowing her nose and not herpes and
that Child Z had a bacterial sore. They have never had a sore since although
each time the
girls had a pimple, the husband described them as
“spontaneous eruptions”. The husband arranged for the girls to have
a swab test which was negative, but then insisted on blood tests.
149 Her response to the husband’s desire to have blood tests was that
the children should be taken to a paediatrician, which
the husband refused to do
and rather he wrote a referral for a blood test himself which the husband
attempted to pass off as having
been written by Dr KK.
150 On 11 November 2017, the husband took the children to the Hospital LL to
be tested for herpes simplex 1 and 2 and Varicella Zoster,
without the agreement
of the wife.
151 In his affidavit of 19 March 2018, the husband asserted that the children
had been diagnosed with herpes by Dr KK. Following that
affidavit, the wife
examine the children and did
not diagnose them with a herpes virus infection.
That email is annexure -4 to the wife’s affidavit of 27 April 2018.
152 On 13 March 2020, an order was made by consent, without the wife
admitting the necessity for the tests and on 3 July 2020 the
husband took the
children for blood tests. The referral for blood tests was obtained from Dr KK,
who the wife deposes did not meet
with or see the children.
153 On 9 July 2020, the results were provided to the children’s GP, Dr
MM, which were negative. Annexure -13 to the wife’s
trial affidavit is a
copy of the results of the children’s blood test.
154 The wife asserts that during the last couple of years the husband has
made disparaging comments to the children that she has given
“disease” and “illness”. She also received text messages
from him telling her that she had given the
children herpes.
155 The wife disclosed during cross-examination that she had been tested in
2020 and was positive for one strain of herpes. Her evidence
was that the
husband was also positive for another strain of herpes and that he got cold
sores on his lips.
156 The wife’s evidence during cross-examination was that she had
consulted her medical practitioner about a possible outbreak
of herpes prior to
meeting the husband. She had never transmitted herpes to the husband, or any
other partner, all three girls were
born via a vaginal delivery and she had not
infected the children. The wife told Dr T she first experienced symptoms of
genital irritation,
which was suggestive of genital herpes at age 19, although
she was not formally tested. She reported to him that she experienced
symptoms about the year prior to the husband finding her prescribed medication,
which was first prescribed in July 2016 and
again in February 2017. Her GP, Dr
MM wanted her to commence herpes medication for a two-year period as a trial, in
case she was
carrying the herpes virus, and that was why she had multiple
subscriptions for the medication.
157 In cross-examination about this topic, her evidence included the
circumstances of the husband’s discovery on 6 July 2017
of her medication,
which was that she had hidden her medication in a box in Child Y’s room
together with her wedding paraphernalia.
The box was stored in a wardrobe which
was 10 feet high, because she did not want the husband going through her
personal things,
which he frequently did throughout the entire marriage. The
husband required a stepladder to access Child Y’s wardrobe.
158 I accept the wife’s evidence about the circumstances surrounding
the description of herpes medication, her attendance on
Dr MM and her comments
159 The husband asserts that the wife did not have herpes during the marriage
and in fact contracted the disease from an affair with
Mr NN in 2016, when she
was first prescribed herpes medication, Valtrex. She was cross-examined about
why she had consulted her GP
and received this prescription at that time and her
evidence was plausible and required her to reveal highly intimate details of
medical history to the court. She was obviously and understandably distressed
which did not persuade me
that the wife was dishonest, disingenuous, or attempting to mislead the court
herpes. Rather, it demonstrated that she was prepared
to disclose intimate medical details which should never have been the subject
cross-examination. The line of questioning and the emphasis on this issue by the
husband, gives considerable weight to the wife’s
submissions that the
husband was overly focused on this issue and considered it a means to denigrate,
embarrass and undermine the
wife. There was no need to pursue the issue in the
manner it was dealt with, if the primary concern was to protect the children
the virus and provide them with appropriate treatment.
160 The second issue which was pursued by the husband during the trial was
whether or not the wife had had an affair, including a
sexual relationship with
161 Much was made of the fact that she had not disclosed to Mr U that she had
a sexual affair with Mr NN. She described it as an emotional
affair, which was
clearly incorrect.
162 She was cross-examined about whether she had had sexual relations with Mr
NN, and her evidence was that she had, which was consistent
with what she told
Dr T. Her evidence was that she had been unable to bring herself to disclose to
Mr U that her affair with Mr NN
was sexual in nature and that about a week after
the interview she had telephoned Mr U with the intention of advising him that
affair was sexual in nature. During the telephone call, she was unable to
bring herself to confess.
163 In his final submissions, the husband was critical of the wife for not
addressing this issue in her affidavit material and asserts
that the wife not
only lied but used the allegation by the husband that she had an affair to
accuse him of controlling, obsessive,
vindictive and judgemental behaviour.
164 Reference is also made in the final submissions about Mr U’s
comments in his first report, when he was unaware that the
wife had failed to
tell the truth, and his comments in cross-examination that such an admission
would demonstrate dishonesty but
it was for the court to determine if that was a
decisive factor in the parenting dispute.
165 I do not understand why it was necessary for the family report to deal
with the issue of the wife’s infidelity during the
marriage, nor why her
failure to disclose a sexual relationship or address it in her affidavit has any
bearing on her capacity as
a parent. This was another example of a highly
inappropriate and intrusive cross-examination which did not assist the
determination
of the real issues between the parties.
166 The third issue which was pursued during the trial was the handover of
the keys to the Property H property. The final written
submissions of the
husband acknowledge that it was a “somewhat trivial matter”. I do
not understand the impact of this
issue on parental capacity other than it
demonstrates an inherent lack of capacity between the parents to cooperate, even
a minor matter.
Parental Responsibility
167 Unsurprisingly, the husband and wife were in
dispute about the issue of parental responsibility. The husband seeks orders
both parents should retain equal shared parental responsibility for the
children, whereas the wife initially sought that she should
have sole parental
responsibility. During his final submissions, Queen’s Counsel for the wife
conceded that the wife would
be agreeable to have sole parental responsibility
for decisions pertaining to the children’s health needs, and otherwise the
parents would have equal shared parental responsibility.
168 Section 61DA provides, when making a parenting order in relation to a
child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in
the best interests of
the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility.
The presumption does not apply
if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a
parent of the child (or a person who lives with the parent of the child) has
in family violence or abuse of the child, or the presumption may be
rebutted by evidence that it would not be in the best interests
of the child for
the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility.
169 The husband submitted that there should be an order for equal shared
parental responsibility for the following reasons:
(a) the presumption of equal shared parental
responsibility has not been rebutted by the wife’s evidence;
(b) whilst both parents concede the high conflict between them, the husband
asserts that the wife has created conflict and disputes
to further her case;
(c) he is optimistic that once the proceedings have resolved, the heat will go
out of the dispute;
(d) the wife’s application for sole parental responsibility for decisions
to Child X, who has both
health and education special needs, and there is no justification for excluding
the husband from health
decisions, if he is otherwise competent to contribute to
educational decisions;
(e) both parents are actively involved with Child X’s support given by C
(f) there is no evidence that the husband has made poor decisions for the
children and in particular he has been unfairly criticised
for his desire to try
CBT before administering anti-anxiety medication and for seeking a referral to a
child psychiatrist for a second
opinion prior to administering Ritalin;
(g) the husband has never sought to terminate Child X’s treatment by Dr
EE, which has been supported by the husband;
(h) Dr EE has not refused to talk to the husband;
(i) the husband has adopted a cautious approach to Child X’s treatment,
particularly medication, which is understandable given
that he is a medical
practitioner himself;
(j) the wife is an anxious woman and her prior history of anxiety and mental
health problems must be considered in that regard;
(k) an order for sole parental responsibility might appease her anxiety and it
may be easier for her not to have to consult with
the husband about medical
issues, but that is not the test;
(l) the husband has much to contribute about Child X’s treatment and his
medical expertise is a further reason to continue
his involvement in Child X and
the other children’s health decisions;
(m) the wife’s decision to refuse to test the children for genital herpes
demonstrates her inability to put the children’s
interests before her own
and is placing the children at risk.
170 The wife submitted that she should have an order for sole parental
responsibility for health decisions, primarily on the basis
of the problems with
decision making about Child X’s health. The wife deposes to problems
reaching a decision about Child X’s
medication.
171 On 18 September 2018, Child X attended on her paediatrician, Dr EE and
was diagnosed with anxiety and OCD, both of which impacted
on her learning. Dr
EE prescribed Zoloft to assist in managing her anxiety.
172 Following that consultation, on 27 September 2018 the wife’s
solicitors wrote to the husband’s solicitors seeking
his consent to
commence a trial of the medication as proposed by Dr EE.
173 On 5 October 2018, the husband’s solicitors forwarded a response to
the wife’s solicitors which is referred to in
paragraph 110 of the
wife’s trial affidavit which includes the following:
... Any excessive anxiety Child X suffers is a direct
result of your client’s own anxieties. Our client has discussed Child
X’s anxiety with her treating paediatrician. Due to the background of this
matter in the first instance it may be better for
the parties to explore
psychological and/or behavioural techniques to assist Child X rather than
medication which may have side-effects.
The paediatrician agreed with our client
that medication should be held off at this stage...
174 At paragraph 111 of her trial affidavit, the wife deposes to being
present with Dr EE when she telephoned the husband to see his
consent about
Child X commencing the medication, and that she did not hear the words
attributed to her by the husband in the letter
referred to in the preceding
175 Following receipt of the letter of 5 October 2018, the wife contacted Dr
EE and obtained a letter from her dated 8 October 2018
in relation to her
discussion with the husband about Child X’s medication. On 11 October
2018, the wife’s solicitors
forwarded a letter to the husband’s
solicitors again requesting the husband to agree with the medication recommended
X by Dr EE, which enclosed Dr EE’s letter of 5 October 2018.
176 On 8 April 2019, the wife’s solicitors forwarded a letter to the
husband’s solicitors noting that one of the issues
to be addressed at a
joint meeting with Ms BB was the recommendation from Dr EE that Child X commence
taking medication. The husband
did not attend a further session with Ms BB in
accordance with the orders of 2 August 2018. The husband’s reason why he
to attend was that he had been served with an intervention order a couple
of days before and that prevented him from attending, notwithstanding
intervention order included an exception for attendance at counselling.
177 On 11 April 2019, the husband’s solicitors forwarded a further
letter to the wife’s solicitors referring to Dr EE’s
recommendation
previous correspondence between lawyers.
178 On 15 April 2019, the wife’s solicitors forwarded a further letter
to the husband’s solicitors suggesting that Child
X attend upon Dr OO, who
was a locum for Dr EE whilst she was on maternity leave, to provide her written
recommendations about Child
X commencing medevac medication and that the husband
and wife should agree to adopt her recommendations.
179 On 13 May 2019, a further letter was forwarded by the husband’s
solicitors referring to the fact that the husband’s
attitude regarding
Child X’s medication had been dealt with in previous correspondence.
180 On 16 May 2019, there wife’s solicitors forwarded a further letter
to the husband’s solicitors about Child X’s
commencement of
medication as recommended by Dr EE.
181 The husband subsequently consented to Child X commencing medication,
which he did on 3 September 2019, some 11 months after it
suggested by Dr EE.
182 Subsequent to that, the wife’s evidence is that she sent a spare
prescription for the medication with Child X in her bag
when she stayed at the
husband’s house so that he could obtain a prescription to use at his home.
The wife emailed the husband
on 20 December 2019 however there was no
response and the spare prescription was left in Child X’s bag and went
183 On 24 July 2020, the wife emailed the husband about a recommended
increase in Child X’s medication and suggested that he
did not respond to her email. In his affidavit of 13 October 2020, filed in
response to the wife’s trial
affidavit, at paragraph 70 the husband
deposes to having cooperated with Child X’s treating psychologist and
paediatrician
at all times. He also deposes to having been uneasy about Child X
commencing medication to assist her anxiety, his preference for
CBT rather than
medication but ultimately he agreed to the medication for Child X recommended by
Dr EE and has ensured she has received
it whilst in his care.
184 His affidavit does not dispute any of the particulars of the wife’s
evidence referred to in the previous paragraphs, nor
was the wife challenged
difficulties she encountered
to obtain the husband’s consent during the 11
month period between when Dr EE first proposed medication and the husband
to Child X commencing the medication.
185 In her affidavit of 19 April 2021, the wife deposes to recent issues
concerning Child X’s health including diagnosis of
ADHD, a recommendation
that Child X commence Ritalin and an episode of “self-harm” on 21
March 2021.
186 She deposes:
(a) on 4 March 2021, she emailed the husband
advising that Child X’s medication had been increased to 30mg a day and
would be tested for ADD;
(b) on 17 March 2021, both the wife and a teacher from Child X’s school,
Ms PP, both completed a Vanderbilt questionnaire in
relation to Child X;
(c) on 18 March 2021, she received an email from Dr EE advising her that Child X
had met the criteria for a ADD diagnosis and that
Dr EE recommended behavioural
strategies at home and in the classroom as well as Ritalin;
(d) on 18 March 2021, she forwarded an email to the husband notifying him of
Child X’s results and forwarding the emails she
received from Dr EE;
(e) on 21 March 2021, Child X advised her mother, whilst at sports training that
the husband had taken her phone had threatened to
smash it. Child X was upset
that her father had threatened to damage her phone;
(f) on Monday, 22 March 2021, while Child X was that her father’s home,
she had scratched her legs with scissors leaving marks
and on that day, Child X
had told someone at C SCHOOL that she wanted to “get a kitchen knife and
kill herself” and that
the school had observed the scratches on Child
(g) the wife received a telephone call whilst at court from C SCHOOL and later
she spoke to Ms QQ, a social worker at C SCHOOL and
Ms RR, Director of Middle
Years at C SCHOOL;
(h) the wife organised an urgent psychologist appointment for Child X via Zoom
with Ms FF, her psychologist on Wednesday, 24 March
(i) on Monday, 22 March 2021, Child X and the other two children were returned
to the wife’s house and Child X apparently told
her mother she was
stressed at her father’s house and she did not understand the implications
of the comment she had made at
(j) on Thursday, 26 March 2021, the children returned to the husband’s
care and Child X reported to her mother that the husband
had refused to give her
anxiety medication, ostensibly on the basis that Dr EE had said she should not
have medication anymore;
(k) on 26 March 2021, the husband forwarded an email to the wife, which was an
email the husband had sent to Dr EE on 25 March 2021
advising that he was
withholding Child X’s anxiety medication until he heard from her or
received other advice that Child X
should be urgently referred to a paediatric
psychiatrist. A copy of that email is -8 to the wife’s affidavit of 19
April 2021;
(l) on 26 March 2021, the wife sent an email to the husband advising him of
Child X’s consultation with Ms FF and querying
whether it was appropriate
to stop Child X’s anxiety medication until that was recommended by Dr
(m) on 26 March 2021, the husband had a conversation with Dr EE and Dr
EE’s diary note of the conversation is annexure -10
to the wife’s
affidavit of 19 April 2021. That diary note states as follows:
Phone call to Rob – father
fluoxetine today due to concern regarding suicidal thoughts
- requested
referral to Paediatric Psychiatrist given recent diagnosis of ADHD and
self-harm/suicide
- became very
angry on the phone
- questioned
“why did you use a mother’s report to make a diagnosis of a mental
illness when the mother has a mental illness
referral to Paediatric Psychiatrist
- I suggested
that I am happy to continue to see Child X, with the support of Ms FF -
Psychologist
- I advise that
fluoxetine should be continued at 30mg. If a decision is made at some stage to
stop fluoxetine, it should be weaned
off, rather than stopping suddenly
Treatment/Plan
referral written to child psychiatrist Dr TT
- email copy to
be sent to father
- Ongoing review
- Review with
myself of 26 April 2021
(n) on 31 March 2021, the husband forwarded an email to the wife which said
“Make sure you attend to this. Thanks
.” in the context of
Child X obtaining a referral to a paediatric psychiatrist;
(o) on 6 April 2021, the wife’s solicitors forwarded an email to the
husband’s solicitors advising that the wife did
not agree to a further
psychiatric assessment of Child X that if he wanted to do so he could organise
it. No response was received
187 The husband was cross-examined about his conversation with Dr EE. His
persistent answer was that Dr EE was confused and unreliable
and that her
statements were fabricated and she must have been confused. He denied demanding
a referral to a paediatric psychiatrist,
but rather described it as asking in a
firm and measured way. He agreed that he had always maintained that the wife had
illness, which she does and that it was not professionally proper to
use somebody with a mental illness history to diagnose someone
188 Although he regarded Child X’s referral to a paediatric
psychiatrist as urgent, apart from contacting another psychiatrist,
was booked out until December, he had not taken any further steps to arrange a
189 In his final written submissions, the husband is critical of the wife for
failing to tell him about Child X’s self-harm
during the first week of the
trial, or that she had arranged an appointment with Ms FF. The wife’s
evidence during cross-examination
was that she assumed the school would directly
explanation
to be eminently reasonable, particularly as the alleged self-harm
occurred on a Sunday when Child X was in the husband’s care
Child X was unable to communicate her
distress to her father whilst in his care
and secondly, that the husband did not perceive the level of Child X’s
while she was in his home.
190 The recent events of March 2021, in relation to Child X’s health
and the husband’s communications with and opinion
of Child X’s
treating paediatrician would make it almost impossible for him to have any
future positive involvement with matters
pertaining to Child X’s health.
It is apparent from the diary note of Dr EE and the husband’s own evidence
that he has
a pejorative view of the wife’s mental health, despite Dr
T’s assessment and no confidence in the professional capability
I do not accept the husband’s evidence and denial of his attitude towards
191 It is obvious that he has little regard for Dr EE’s professionalism
and her diagnosis. His repetitive description of her
as confused and unreliable
is offensive and scathing. These events, when taken together with the events
between September 2018 and
September 2019, lead to the conclusion that the
husband’s involvement in decision-making about Child X’s health have
led to a delay of some 11 months in implementation of medication recommended by
her treating paediatrician and the husband taking
matters into his own hands,
contrary to Dr EE’s advice, by ceasing Child X’s fluoxetine. It is
difficult to contemplate
any future scenario whereby the husband would have any
respect for or wish to comply with any recommendations of Dr EE, unless her
recommendations accorded with his view of the world. The events referred to in
the previous paragraphs, are sufficient to warrant
an order that the wife have
sole parental responsibility pertaining to Child X’s health issues, albeit
she should advise him
prior to any health decision being made.
192 I do not accept the submission of the husband that he should not be
excluded from decision-making pertaining to Child X’s
health, because no
such exclusion is sought in relation to her education. There did not seem to be
any particular dispute about Child
X’s education particularly as both
parents wish her to continue at C SCHOOL. It was obvious from cross-examination
of the wife
and involvement with the school support for Child X. She did not
seek an order
for sole parental responsibility in this regard and there does not seem to have
been any adverse impact on decision-making
by the school for support measures
for Child X, notwithstanding the husband’s limited involvement with the
193 I also do not accept the submissions referred to in the previous
paragraphs about the husband’s cautious and conservative
approach to
medicating Child X and his asserted support of her treatment. His communications
with Dr EE, as recorded by her and his
contemptuous attitude towards her does
not support that proposition. I also reject the submission that the husband has
much to contribute
to decisions about treatment of Child X, as he has done to
date. It is apparent from the events between September 2018 and September
and of March 2021 that he has not positively contributed to Child X’s
treatment, rather he has sought to undermine, question
and not comply with
recommendations of her treating paediatrician.
194 I do not share his view that communication and the parental relationship
will improve on finalisation of the proceedings. The
parties have been separated
since July 2017 in highly acrimonious and conflictual circumstances and have
been polarised in the majority
of aspects of their life. Neither party seem to
be suffering from ‘litigation fatigue’ or demonstrate any particular
actions or circumstances which would indicate some desire to improve their
parenting relationship. Indeed, I would assume the contrary,
particularly
because of the manner in which the husband’s case was conducted and the
cross-examination by his Queen’s
Counsel about matters clearly designed to
humiliate and embarrass the wife, which continued in some instances, until court
intervention.
195 I intend to make an order that the wife have sole parental responsibility
for Child X’s health issues, and that otherwise
the parties retain equal
shared parental responsibility.
196 The wife also sought to rely on her difficulties with communicating with
the husband in support of an order for sole parental
responsibility for Child
X’s health. I agree that the poor and sometimes non-existent communication
between the parents would
also support an order for the wife to have sole
parental responsibility for Child X’s health issues. I refer to the
communication in my consideration of whether it is reasonably
practicable for the children to live equal time with both parents.
Statutory Pathway
197 Having determined that it is in the best
interests of the children that there be an order for equal shared parental
responsibility,
except for decisions pertaining to Child X’s health, I
will now address the statutory pathway set out in s 65DAA(1)-(5) of
198 Where the parents have equal shared parental responsibility for a child,
subsections (1) to (5) inclusive of s 65DAA of the Act
require the court to
consider the child spending equal time, or a substantial and significant time,
with each parent, and whether
that is reasonably practicable.
199 I will firstly consider whether it is in the children’s best
interests for them to spend equal time with each of the parents.
200 The husband proposes that the children should spend equal time with each
of the parents in a week about configuration. That is
opposed by the wife, who
seeks orders that the existing time between the husband and the children should
be reduced.
201 The husband proposes that the children should live in a week about
arrangement for the following principal reasons:
(a) the wife’s long past history of
mental health is relevant to the need for the involvement of both parents and
the children’s
(b) the wife is harming the children by not facilitating their relationship with
him and creating anxiety for them;
(c) his proposal reduces the need for the children to move from home to home and
minimises the effect of the wife’s anxiety
and enmeshment with the
children, which allow the children time to settle into each parent’s
(d) his proposal provides structure and containment;
(e) his work situation enables him to meet his duties and responsibilities about
the care, welfare and development of the
202 In his final written submissions, the husband submits that the primary
considerations support an equal shared care arrangement
or substantial and
significant time.
203 The wife opposes the children spending equal time with each parent for
the following principal reasons:
(a) the children, and in particular Child Y
and Child X are vehemently opposed to such an arrangement, or indeed to spending
any additional
time with the husband;
(b) there is no co-parenting relationship;
(c) there is no communication between the parents;
(d) the nature of the husband’s relationship with the children is
contraindicative to equal time;
(e) shared care is entirely inconsistent with the children’s lived
history, namely:
(i) since they were born, the
wife has not only been the primary caregiver, but most of the children’s
time has been spent with
their mother;
(ii) the husband’s onerous professional responsibility and heavy workload
meant that he worked effectively six days a week;
(iii) the husband’s activities such as bike riding on Saturdays and
Sundays for four hours or so at a time, including him taking
up marathon
running, resulted in the children spending even more time with their mother than
would have been anticipated;
(iv) the separate holidays of the family, when the wife and children would
holiday together and the husband would holiday independently,
including cycling
holidays in Europe;
(f) shared care is inconsistent with the
husband’s evidence of availability for the children, which was apparent in
his cross-examination
of his business;
(g) it is inconsistent with the personality types of the parents and their
incredibly conflicting and different parenting styles;
(h) it is inconsistent with the case that he has conducted against the wife
including she has mental health problems, she is cavalier
and careless with the
children’s health because she carried the herpes virus, which somehow puts
the children at risk, and
that she is morally compromised because she was
unfaithful.
204 Mr U, the family report writer gave evidence and was cross-examined by
both Queen’s Counsel for the husband and Queen’s
Counsel for the
wife. His recommendation for the future living arrangements for the children, as
clarified in his second affidavit
filed 15 October 2020 was that the existing
parenting arrangements should continue.
205 His evidence during cross-examination, pertaining to the future living
arrangements for the children may be summarised as follows:
(a) in relation to his observations of the
children in the waiting room:
(i) the wife was unable to
untangle herself and her feelings from the children and their feelings;
(ii) the behaviour of the husband was a component to that;
(iii) the children are emotionally involved and entwined with their mother more
than they are with their father;
(iv) the children are more emotionally connected to and relied upon their mother
than their father;
(v) the wife is more in tune, aware of and engages with the children better than
their father;
(vi) the husband doesn’t necessarily relate more and reflect upon the
children and their emotional state;
(vii) the children are more enmeshed with their mother than their father;
(viii) there is no pathological component to the children being more enmeshed
with their mother;
(b) the husband did not manage the situation
in the waiting room well, which highlighted that he had a lack of containment, a
of limits and a lack of control, which was a window into and highly
revealing of his management style of the children;
(c) the wife could have intervened more firmly by telling the children to go
back inside clean up the room;
(d) the dynamic and pattern of the family is due to a long drawn out history of
difficulties with children who are caught in the
middle of an untenable
(e) the family is not functioning well, which should be plain and obvious to
(f) the children have lost a sense of trust and confidence in their father
because of the way he interacts with them and the problems
between the
(g) it is impossible to imagine how children cannot be intertwined with their
parents and their parents emotional state and conflict;
(h) Child Z’s behaviour is problematic although she is more affectionate
towards her father, she is also extremely controlling
and highly irritable which
is another example of Child Z or each of the children being very anxious;
(i) he accepted the husband was critical of him for failing to conduct an
observation session in the second report and that he did
not do so because it
was an update;
(j) he did not consider that he had placed inordinately high emphasis on the
observation in the first report and that he had equally
drawn attention to some
of his concerns in relation to the wife and her behaviour and he was attempting
to give a balanced perspective
of the family;
(k) his conclusion in the report is that the family is experiencing really
significant problems and that he doesn’t think the
husband has managed
them particularly well;
(l) the second report was an update on how the children were feeling and that he
did not conduct a further observation session between
the wife and the
(m) he accepted that the wife suffers anxiety but he does not consider that her
anxiety is fuelling the entanglement in the lives
of the children and their
different activities;
(n) as to the impact of the various medical conditions of the wife, as asserted
by the husband, Mr U responded that she had a lovely
relationship with her
children, they are reliant and dependent upon her, the children tell him that
she says they should see their
father and have a relationship with him and that
her anxiety causes her to worry about the children and it is inevitable that
the children must be in part aware of that;
(o) the information about the wife’s gambling at poker machines was new to
him and the issue was whether it was impacting on
her capacity to parent the
children in a real and tangible way or not;
(p) he does not know whether the wife’s gambling and care of the children
are connected, and what he sees through the eyes
of the children is that they
perceive their mother as safe, secure and trustworthy;
(q) he had no reason to doubt the opinions of Dr MM, Dr GG or Dr T but in terms
of whether the psychiatric history of a parent impacts
significantly on the
appropriate development of teenagers, he would try and rely on his own
observations of the teenagers and what
he was seeing is that these children are
caught in a disturbed family context;
(r) in the context of acknowledging the warmth between Child X and her father,
he was not recommending that the children’s
time with their father be
(s) it’s a question of the amount of time that could be spent with their
father that would be best for the children and that
all three of the children
give indication of warmth and affection for their father;
(t) in terms of contact between the children and their mother whilst in the care
of their father, who was initiating the contact
gives a different complexion to
such contact;
(u) if the children are contacting the wife, it may mean that they either they
can’t separate from her and their preoccupied
or it is because they feel
comfort and reassurance by having contact with their mother, such contact may
mean different things at
different times;
(v) in the context of the different roles adopted by each parent in the family,
namely the husband was the provider and the wife
adopted a more traditional
role, what he saw indicated that the family had problems from the beginning and
that he did not think
it was a family that had ever functioned well;
(w) his report did not particularly rely or place much weight on the truth of
what either of the parents said about their past history
and he did not know if
it was at all relevant to the children and their needs and relationship with
their parents today;
(x) whether or not the wife was honest would not necessarily impact on his
recommendations in the report because of his recommendations
almost exclusively
rely on his observations;
(y) there was nothing that approximated the level of cohesion and cooperation
which he thinks a shared care management requires,
particularly in the context
of children saying they don’t particularly want to do so;
(z) he raised the issue of the wife’s affair because he wanted to clarify
it as it had been raised in discussion by the husband
who placed considerable
emphasis on it, although it was a long time ago;
(aa) he has relied upon his own opinion and assessment in formulating the
recommendations rather than historical considerations,
although he is aware how
damaged and dysfunctional the parenting relationship was;
(bb) whether the wife had sex with Mr NN or the husband had sex with a health
professional, is not relevant to what was being discussed
in terms of today;
(cc) the issue of availability of electronic devices was a problem for all
(dd) in response to the proposition, what’s wrong with having equality of
time, but parallel parenting approaches, the number
of nights for this family
was actually irrelevant and that he would not draw the immediate parallel
between time spent and quality
of relationship;
(ee) if the husband was intimately involved with the children and was
emotionally available and connected to them, notwithstanding
how much time is
spent away, that would be very different;
(ff) similarly just because of the wife spent time with the children, if she
parented them poorly or she wasn’t attuned to
them, or if they
didn’t work in unison, the children might be enormously relieved when
their father came home;
(gg) he was not sure that it was possible to draw that kind of linear connection
with the family as damaged as this family;
(hh) in order to share the care the children in this family would require a
level of cooperation and cohesion about minor things,
like sport and much, much
bigger things as he expressed in his second report about the concept of parallel
parenting, it will cause
a split and amplify and exaggerate what is a very
disparate life for the girls and it’s hard to imagine how shared parenting
would work for them;
(ii) the parents were unlikely to be able to act cooperatively at the
children’s activities such as sport;
(jj) he would encourage the court to adopt a broad-brush plan for the children
where they are going to spend time with their father,
would have pick up and
drop off from school, and clear rules about who is going to see the children
when during school holidays and
special occasions, to take out as much
“grey” as possible;
(kk) the reality for these children is that their parents will have different
rules and different expectations which will make life
more complicated for them,
and how that pans out over time is anyone’s guess;
(ll) having a fractured broken parental family life places kids at high risk of
having difficulties and there are real vulnerabilities
for these children;
(mm) in response to my queries about Child X and her particular problems, his
response was that the cornerstone of healthy development
is consistency,
stability and predictability. Change can be difficult for some people regardless
of whether they have developmental
vulnerabilities or not, ... but, obviously,
less change is better than more change, and if there has to be change, try and
the magnitude of that change.
206 Towards the end of his cross-examination of Mr U, the following exchange
occurred between Queen’s Counsel for the husband
Okay. I mean, getting to the ultimate question, I mean
as a clinical psychologist, why shouldn’t [Mr Stanton] have equal
hope that that’s clear in my second report. I just don’t
think – well, we actually know quite a lot about social
– the social
science tells us quite a lot about post-separation parenting arrangements, your
Honour, and I think a good distillation
of it is that children whose parents
separate and whose parents maintain a positive cooperative relationship have
children who do
no better or worse than any other children, including children
whose parents don’t separate. What we know is that the gold
standard is
for children to have more time with their parents rather than less. The catch is
that children whose parents separate
who maintain high levels of conflict and
who share the care of their children, do worse than any other single group,
including worse
than children whose parents separate and have no contact with
the parent. Such is the detrimental effect of parental conflict. That
worry, that the relationship between [Mr and Mrs Stanton] is really, really
poor, and that they don’t show any of the
fundamentals necessary for a
cooperative co-parenting arrangement, let alone a shared parenting arrangement.
So we’re talking
children’s time is, I think, elevated to a chattel, and I don’t
think this should be about [Mr or Mrs Stanton]. I don’t think it should be
they deserve because if I was
being really critical, what I would say is that reflects a narcissistic self
over investment in their
own views ahead of their children and that
they’re treating their children like possessions because if they were able
they would shift in a way that would most likely enhance the welfare
of the children, which has got nothing to do with the amount
of time. Most kids
I see actually don’t like living in two houses, even when they’ve
got a good relationship with their
parents. Find it a pain and find it a
nuisance and find it disruptive and find it difficult and it’s a hassle. I
think we’ve
got parents who are just on the – different pages and
can’t make the minutiae of that arrangements work and becomes really,
really difficult for these – for these young people. So that’s, I
guess, ultimately why I have recommended what I’ve
recommended.
It’s, again, more a process, rather than a content. I do believe the
children should be seeing their dad. I would
even love to see an outcome where
they got to see more of him because things have settled and they wanted to do
that at the moment,
as they presented to me. They’re not saying that
that’s what they want.
207 Despite the reasons supporting an equal time arrangement set out in the
husband’s written submissions which are referred
to in paragraph 201
hereof, the final question Queen’s Counsel put to Mr U during
cross-examination about the issue of equal
... What I was suggesting to you before that short
adjournment was [Mr Stanton] feels aggrieved in being left in the status quo
when he thinks, in terms of parenting, he should have a right to equal
208 I can only presume the question was asked upon instructions and in my
view the perceived “right to equal time” epitomises
husband’s view of the future parenting arrangements, irrespective of the
other reasons proffered in the written submissions,
and the other compelling
objective evidence adduced during the trial, including that given by Mr U.
209 The response to that question was:
MR JONES: Well, could you
repeat your answer, please?---If I can distil it down, children whose parents
separate maintain high levels
of conflict and who share the care of their
children have children who do worse than any other group. I don’t think
Mrs Stanton] have anything approximating a fundamental required for a
share care arrangement, whether it’s equal time or not
equal time.
Well, so how do you say the time should be regulated?---I think I say that in my
report. I think that alternate weekends from a Friday
to a Monday morning, a
night overnight in the other week, sharing of holidays and significant dates,
pick-up and drop-off from school
and, hopefully, that things do improve. Because
these are kids who are – I’ve got to check how old Child Y is now.
210 In my view, the factors which are particularly relevant in a
consideration of whether there should be an equal shared care arrangement
include the parents capacity to communicate, the prior history of the care of
the children, whether the parties share similar fundamental
parenting values,
the parents capacity to compromise issues in dispute, can the parents mange the
practical difficulties of children
living in two different households, their
attitude towards the parenting capacity of the other parent, the proximity of
the respective
households and the views of the children and the factors
influencing those views.
211 In this family, regrettably the dynamic does not support any of those
factors. There is currently no capacity to communicate which
is also likely to
continue into the future, the undisputed prior history of care is that the wife
has consistently been the parent
who has been primarily responsible for the care
of the children, the parties views about fundamental parenting values could not
more divergent, particularly in the context of the children’s
extra-curricular activities and Child X’s health issues,
each parent is
rigid and convinced their attitude is inherently correct and the rigid attitude
to changeover venues demonstrated
by the husband, there have been past disputes
dispute about the children’s bathers and collection of forgotten
not want to live in
a shared care arrangement when I have determined that those views are reasonably
held. The only positive factor
supporting a shared care arrangement is the two
parental households are relatively close in proximity.
212 I do not accept the reasons submitted by the husband why it would be
appropriate for equal care. There is no objective evidence
support the husband’s
view. His submissions about over enmeshment of the
children in her anxieties and fears is not supported by Mr U and there is no
that the wife has not facilitated the children’s time with the
husband. I also do not accept the evidence of the husband of
flexibility and availability for the children, particularly in the context of
the historical division of parenting roles
in the family, prior to and
subsequent to separation.
213 I accept the submissions on behalf of the wife and I unequivocally accept
the evidence of Mr U during cross-examination. I do
not consider that there is
any possibility whatsoever that the children living in a shared care arrangement
would be in their best
interests. Mr U’s concluding evidence about the
future trajectory for these children, based on the high levels of parental
conflict is chilling.
214 Whether an order for equal time is reasonably practicable, was not really
the focus of the evidence or submissions during the
trial. I will address the
considerations in s 65DAA(5).
215 Firstly, the parties live in relative close proximity to each other which
would not present any practical impediments.
216 Secondly, the capacity for the parents to implement the arrangement. I do
not accept that the husband’s work commitments
are flexible to the degree
submitted by him, and would be such to enable him to meet the day-to-day
commitments of the children including
their substantial commitments to
extracurricular activities, on a week about basis. Queen’s Counsel for the
husband put to
the wife that the husband works 24/7 and has a heavy workload
including working on both Saturdays and Sundays. That is more truly
of the husband’s workload rather than his attempts to minimise this and
emphasise his flexibility.
217 Thirdly, the parental capacity to communicate and resolve difficulties.
The issue of the communication difficulties between the
parents is addressed in
the wife’s trial affidavit, and is also evident from the correspondence,
or lack thereof, between solicitors
for the period September 2018 to September
2019, in the context of implementing medication for Child X. There were
significant periods
of time when legal communication did not occur and the end
result was that Child X did not commence her prescribed medication until
11 months of correspondence between the lawyers. The fact that the parties were
unable to resolve this issue without recourse
to the lawyers, is indicative of
the complete breakdown of communication between them. It does not bode well for
any prospect of
polite and civil communication to resolve any issues which would
inevitably arise from an equal time arrangement.
218 The wife’s evidence in her trial affidavit about lack of
communication, refers to text messages, commencing in July 2017,
around the time
of separation, which the husband forwarded to the wife, and which were highly
offensive and inflammatory. The messages
included a picture message of a
pathology request form completed by the husband in his capacity as a doctor,
requesting tests for
the wife for HIV, hepatitis B, C, Serology, herpes, PCR,
gonorrhoea swab, and Chlamydia swab.
219 She deposes to further offensive messages referring to the wife
masturbating, having phone sex, having her fanny waxed, legs lasered,
hair and nails done, all of which distracted her from cooking a meal for the
children. On 20 July 2017, the husband sent a
picture message to the wife and
her sister-in-law, of a sex toy and herpes medication. On 4 March 2018, the
husband sent a text message
to the wife accusing her of giving the children
facial genital herpes and on 25 July 2018 a message which included
would you like it if the girls found that you managed to give them genital
herpes? Grow up. I’ve passed this on to
the courts as well.”
28 July 2018, 9 November 2018, 24 November 2018, 3 December 2018, 22 December
2018, 12 January 2019, and 18 February 2019 the husband
forwarded offensive text
messages to the wife, referring to genital herpes and implying, and specifically
stating that the wife had
given the children genital herpes.
220 In terms of the parties attending any future counselling to address
communication problems, orders were made on 2 August 2018
providing for the
parties to attend upon Ms BB for non-reportable family therapy. The parties
attended on 21 February 2019, and thereafter
the husband did not attend. His
evidence was that there was an intervention order taken out by the wife a few
days prior to the proposed
further appointment, which prevented him from
attending. There have been no further attempts between the parties to attend any
therapy and the husband resists any order requiring him to do so.
221 Fourthly, the impact on the children. The impact on the children of a
week about situation would be dire. The children’s
lived experience has
been in the substantial care of their mother to whom they are primarily
attached. The two older children are
strident in their views that they do not
wish to spend any more time with their father than the existing arrangements,
and arguably
they would like a reduction in time they spend with him.
Additionally, Child X’s anxieties, in the context of her need for
consistency and predictability, may well be exacerbated by increasing the time
with her father, in circumstances where she is opposed
to any increase. There is
a pervasive theme in the family reports of Child X’s connection to her
mother and her overwhelming
desire to spend time with her mother and the
increased anxiety she experiences when she is separated from her mother. Apart
the immediate impact on the children, the evidence of Mr U about the
pessimistic future trajectory for children from highly conflictual
circumstances, who live in an equal care arrangement, is compelling.
222 Having regard to my comments in the preceding paragraphs, on the evidence
relevant to this consideration, I do not consider that
equal time each parent
would be reasonably practicable for these children.
223 Having so determined that equal time is not in the children’s best
interests, nor reasonably practicable, I am now required
to consider whether the
spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents would be in
the children’s best
interests and whether it would be reasonably
practicable.
224 Their Honours Ainslie–Wallace and Ryan JJ, in
[2016] FamCAFC 133
at paragraphs [84] to [88], considered what is
substantial and significant time.
225 In his final written submissions, as an alternative to equal time, the
husband seeks to spend substantial and significant time
with the children. His
proposals for substantial and significant time are in accordance with the
existing interim consent orders
made 2 August 2018. As a result, I can
confidently assume that his proposal, from his perspective, meets the criteria,
both regulatory
and discretionary, of substantial and significant time.
226 At the commencement of the trial the wife sought orders for the existing
arrangements to continue, but during the trial she proposed
children’s term time with their father should be reduced each alternate
weekend from the conclusion of school until
5:00PM on Sunday.
227 There is no doubt that the existing arrangements for the children satisfy
the statutory elements of substantial and significant
time. In the factual
circumstances of this family, I am also satisfied that the existing arrangements
provide for time and that is
both substantial and significant. I am not
satisfied that a reduction in time as contemplated by the wife, in the factual
of the case, could be described as both substantial and significant
228 The existing arrangements enable the husband to spend time with the
children so that he is involved in both their schooling and
extracurricular
activities, during term time, he is able to celebrate significant events with
the children, including birthdays,
Father’s Day and Christmas Day and that
he can spend extended time with the children during school holidays. He also
time with the children on a regular weekly basis during term time.
229 I refer to the discussion about reasonably practicable at paragraph 223
hereof. Many of the considerations discussed in the context
of equal time, are
applicable to substantial and significant time. However I am persuaded in the
circumstances, in particular because
the arrangements have been a long-standing
since August 2018 that substantial and significant time for the children with
their father,
is reasonably practicable.
230 At the conclusion of the trial the wife changed her proposal to reduce
the children’s time with the husband. She did so
ostensibly on the basis
of her observations of the husband’s agitation in the witness box and his
answers during cross-examination.
Mr U did not support a reduction in the time
between the children and their father, and I am also not persuaded that a
in time is supported by the evidence, or indeed would be in the
children’s best interests.
231 I intend to make orders for the husband to spend term time with the
children during term time in accordance with the existing
arrangements, namely
the orders of 2 August 2018.
232 The parties are also in dispute about the further following issues:
(a) the children’s time during term
holidays and long summer holidays;
(b) whether both parents should be permitted to attend medical appointments and
the children are in the care of the other parent;
(c) whether the children should be required to attend all extracurricular
activities as proposed by the wife;
(d) whether the other parent is permitted to attend the children’s
extracurricular activities during the other parent’s
time with the
(e) whether both parents should be restrained from physically disciplining the
children or just the husband;
(f) whether the husband should be responsible for the costs of the
children’s passports when renewed, or whether that cost
233 Firstly, I will address the children’s time during term holidays
and long summer holidays. The parties’ proposals
differ as to
configuration of the time during both school term holidays and long summer
234 The husband seeks that the school term holidays should be shared between
the parents, as agreed between the parties and failing
agreement, with the
husband for the first half of the school term holidays in 2020 and in each
alternative year thereafter with the
wife for the first half of the school term
holidays, save for the term three holidays, where the husband would have the
each year and the wife would have the second half.
235 The wife also proposes a sharing of the school term holidays and that the
husband have the first half of the term three holidays
and she have the second
236 During the long summer school holidays, the husband proposes that the
children spend one half of the holidays as agreed the between
the parties with a
default provision so that the husband’s regular term time continue until
3:30 PM on 24 December 2020, the
children spend time with him from 3:30PM on
Christmas Day until 3:30PM on 12 January and with the wife from 3:30PM on
until the commencement of school on the first day of term. That would
have the effect of the children spending the first half of
the summer holidays
each year with the husband, unless the parties were able to agree otherwise.
237 The wife proposes that, apart from Christmas Day arrangements, in 2021
and alternative years thereafter that the children spend
time with the husband
from 3 PM on Christmas Day until 8 January 2021 and in 2022 and alternative
years the children spend time with
the husband for 14 nights from 3:00PM on 1
January until 3:00PM on 15 January.
238 The reason for the differing proposals during the summer holidays seems
to be that the husband seeks orders that the children
spend time with him
between Christmas and New Year each year, whereas the wife seeks this time to
alternate. In his final submissions,
the husband refers to his “[work]
commitments over the long summer holidays” as possible justification for
sought by him. There was no evidence about such commitments. There
was no evidence to suggest why the husband should have the children
from 3:30 PM on Christmas Day until 12 January each year and I am of the view
that the holidays should be shared equally
between the parents and that the
wife’s proposal meets this objective.
239 Secondly, I will address the attendance of both parents that the
children’s medical appointments. The wife seeks an order
that each parent
can attend the children’s medical appointments if it is during the other
parent’s time, whereas the
husband consents to the wife attending
specialist medical appointments, but not general medical appointments.
240 As I have determined that the wife should have sole parental
responsibility for Child X’s health issues, it is not appropriate
husband attend medical appointments for Child X, either specialist or general.
Otherwise, as the parties have equal shared
parental responsibility for Child Y
and Child Z, I consider it appropriate that both parents should be entitled to
attend all medical
appointments for those children, even if the children are in
the other’s care.
241 Thirdly, I will address the issue of the children’s extracurricular
activities. The wife seeks orders that both parents
must take the children to
all curricular activities they are involved in, during time the children are
with them. The husband opposes
such an order on the basis that he wants to be
able to have the children involved in activities they want to do, but in a way
gives them balance and variety. The wife’s activities in her proposed
minute of order includes Sporting games, including training,
tryouts and
tournaments, sporting clinics and all play ball games.
242 The wife also seeks an order that she be able to attend extracurricular
activities during the husband’s time with the children,
whereas the
husband does not want the wife to attend any such activities during his time
other than school events. He also seeks
an order that each parent only attend
swimming during the time the children are in their respective care.
243 I am of the view that it is appropriate for the children to continue to
participate in their extracurricular activities and that
both parents should be
able to attend the extracurricular activities, even during times when the
children are in the care of the
other parent. The parents need to reflect on
their past conduct and the distress they have caused for the children and as
intelligent
and devoted parents devise a strategy which will enable the children
to continue with their activities supported by both parents.
244 I intend to make orders in accordance with the proposal of the wife.
245 Fourthly, I will address the restraint on physical discipline of the
children. The wife seeks an order that the husband be restrained
from physically
disciplining the children, whereas the husband will agree to mutual orders for
restraint on physical discipline with
a denial for necessity of that order.
246 There was evidence during the trial about the husband’s physical
discipline of the children and his inappropriate behaviour
specifically the voice recordings which were played during the trial. Evidence
was also adduced about an occasion when
one of the children telephoned the
police emergency number in response to the husband’s attempts to
confiscate a telephone.
Conversely, there were no allegations or assertions that
the wife had physically inappropriately disciplined the children in any
whatsoever. In the circumstances, I do not consider it appropriate that there be
any restraint on the wife as there is no
evidence to support any such order,
whereas there is evidence to support the order as sought by the wife. I intend
to make an order
that the husband be restrained from physically disciplining the
children, although the court will note that the husband denies the
necessity for
such an order.
247 Fifthly, I will address the cost of renewal of the children’s
passports. The husband seeks an order that the wife contribute
a half share of
the cost of renewal of the passports, whereas the wife seeks that the husband be
responsible for the cost.
248 In the context of the overall financial dispute between the parties, this
dispute is minor. The orders which I intend to make
for child support and other
financial support of the children warrant an order that this minor cost should
be shared between the
249 I will now consider the competing applications
for a division of property between the parties.
RELEVANT LEGISLATION
250 Property proceedings between parties to the
marriage are governed by the provisions of s 79 of the Act.
251 Section 79(1) of the Act provides that the court may make such orders as
it considers appropriate altering the interests of the
parties in the
252 Section 79(2) provides as follows:
The court shall not make an order under this section
unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable
to make the order.
253 If the Court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to make an order
altering the interests of the parties in property, s
79(4) of the Act sets out
the matters which the court must take into account when considering what order
(if any) should be made.

255 Prior to the decision of the High Court in
Stanford v Stanford
[2012] HCA 52
”) the preferred approach to
determine property matters was set out by the Full Court in the matter of
the Marriage of Hickey
[2003] FamCA 395
256 The approach, as set out in
(supra) may be summarised as
follows. Firstly, the court should make findings as to the identity and value of
the property pool.
Secondly, the court should determine the contributions of the
parties both direct and indirect, including financial and non-financial
contributions and then determine the contribution based entitlements of each of
the parties; as a percentage of the value of the
property of the parties.
Thirdly, the court should determine whether any further adjustment should be
made to the contribution based
entitlements of the parties, after giving
consideration to the relevant matters referred to in
of the Act.
Fourthly, the court should consider the effect of those findings and decide what
order for division of property is just
and equitable.
(supra) the High Court noted that
enables the
court to make such orders as it considers appropriate. However, prior to making
any orders for the adjustment of parties
interests in property, the court must
determine whether it is just and equitable to make any property orders, or to
alter the parties
interests in property.
258 At Paragraph [36] of Stanford, the High Court said:
[36] The expression “just and equitable” is
a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range
of potentially competing considerations. It does not admit of exhaustive
definition. It is not possible to chart its metes and
Bevan & Bevan
[2013] FamCAFC 116
”) the Full Court considered which matters might be
taken into account in determining whether it is just and equitable to alter
existing property interests.
260 At paragraphs [84] and [85], Bryant CJ and Thackray J said:
[84] Just as the expression “just and
equitable” does not admit of exhaustive definition, it is not possible to
the “range of potentially competing considerations” that
may be taken into account in determining whether it is just
and equitable to
make an order altering property interests. However, in our view, it would be a
fundamental misunderstanding to read
as suggesting that the
matters referred to in
(4) should be ignored in coming to that decision.
Indeed, such a reading would ignore the plain words of
which make clear
that in considering “what order (if any) to make, the court must take into
account the matters referred to
in that subsection.
[85] This requirement to consider the
matters, in determining whether it
is just and equitable to make any order provides fertile ground for potential
conflation of the
two different issues, which the High Court has warned against.
However, this potential will not be realised in many cases because
of what the
plurality said at [42] about the “just and equitable” requirement
being “readily satisfied”.
But there will be a range of cases, of
which arguably the present is a good example, we determining whether it is just
and equitable
to make any order altering property interests will not be so clear
cut and will therefore require not only separate but very careful
deliberation.
(supra), Finn J stated at paragraph 169:
[169] Findings of fact concerning of the parties
financial history (i.e. the contributions) and their present circumstances and
prospects made in the context of
will also assist, but such
findings cannot (according to Stanford) be conclusive in determining whether or
not it is just and equitable
to make an order altering any particular property
262 The Full Court in
Chancellor & McCoy
[2016] FamCAFC 256
at paragraph [42]:
[42] In adopting the approach she did, her Honour
proceeded in accordance with what the Full Court said in both
, namely that it is open to a trial judge to take into account the
matters stated in
Family Law Act
") when determining whether it is "just and equitable" to adjust
existing property interests. However, consistent with
Honour also recognised that it was not open to her to decide that issue merely
by reference to those matters.
263 The High Court stated in
[37] First, it is necessary to begin consideration of
whether it is just and equitable to make property settlement order by
identifying,
according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the
existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property
question posed by
is thus whether, having regard to those existing
interests, the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to make a
settlement order.
264 At paragraph [40] of
(supra), the High Court stressed
that the question of whether it is just and equitable to make property
settlement orders should
not be answered by starting with an assumption:
[40] ... that one or other party has the right to have
the property of the parties divided between them, or has the right to an
in a marital property which is fixed by reference to the various
matters (including financial and other contributions) set out in
power to make a property settlement order must be exercised. "In accordance with
legal principles, including the principles which
the act itself lays down". To
conclude that making an order is "just and equitable" only because of and by
reference to various matters
without a separate consideration of
, would be to conflate the statutory requirements and ignore the principles
laid down by the
265 The High Court further stated at [42]:
[42] In many cases where an application is made for a
property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily
by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of
the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital
relationship. It will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order
in such a case because there is not and will not
thereafter be the common use of
property by the husband and wife. No less importantly, the express and implicit
assumptions that
underpinned the existing property arrangements have been
brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital
relationship. That is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may
have made to the effect that existing arrangements
of marital property interests
were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital
relationship is brought to an
end with the ending of the marital relationship.
And the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected
consensually
as needed or desired is also brought to an end. Hence it will be
just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order.
What order,
if any, should then be made is determined by applying
266 In summary, in the majority of matters the decision as to whether or not
it is just and equitable for the Court to make property
orders is resolved by
the breakdown of the marital relationship and the mutual applications of the
parties to the court for orders
altering their respective property
Is it just and equitable to alter the parties' property
267 In this matter the parties have separated and
both parties have made applications to the court seeking orders altering their
property interests.
268 The parties are no longer living in a marital relationship, and as stated
at paragraph [42] of
, there will not "
thereafter be the
common use of property by the husband and the wife
269 I am satisfied that it is just and equitable to alter the parties'
property interests.
270 Having satisfied myself that it is just and equitable to make an order
altering the interests of the parties in the property,
the approach and
considerations I must make are as follows:
(a) attribute value to the assets comprising
the property pool;
(b) identify and give weight to the various contributions of each of the parties
as set out in
-(c) and make an assessment as to the entitlements of
the parties based on their respective contribution;
(c) identify the relevant considerations as set out in
-(g), including
the matters set out in
so far as they are relevant, and then decide
whether any further adjustment is appropriate;
(d) consider whether the proposed orders are

273 In order to identify the existing legal and equitable interests in
property of the parties, I must consider how to treat the assets/liabilities
which both parties claim should be included/excluded from the asset pool. I will
address each of the disputed assets/liabilities
274 The parties are in dispute about the value to be attributed to both the
Property E and Property M properties. It is not necessary
to make a finding
hearing that both of the properties
will be sold. The only outstanding dispute
in relation to the properties is whether or not the anticipated capital gains
will be crystallise upon sale of the property should be included in
the pool as a liability. The wife seeks to include the capital
gains tax as a
liability and the husband does not.
Assets/liabilities the husband seeks to include/exclude from
the asset pool
275 The husband seeks to add back into the asset
pool the following:
(a) the sum of $470,000 the wife withdrew
from the Westpac offset account;
(b) the sum of $346,241 being legal fees paid by the wife to date;
(c) withdrawals from the wife’s superannuation fund of $56,736 made 6 June
2019 and September 2020.
276 The husband seeks to exclude from the asset pool the legal fees paid by
him of $333,460.
277 The liabilities which the husband seeks to include in the asset pool are
as follows:
(a) land tax of $17,825, in the wife’s
name, in accordance with annexure RG-12 to his affidavit of 19 March 2021;
(b) anticipated capital gains tax from the sale of Property E and Property
(c) capital gains tax from the sale of Q Shares ($175,000);
(d) accounting fees of $5,933;
(e) his PAYG instalment due 31 March 2021
($130,241).
Assets/liabilities the wife seeks to include/exclude from the
278 The wife seeks to include in the asset pool the
sum of $479,221 which the husband paid to C SCHOOL in February 2021, without her
knowledge or consent. The inclusion of this amount in the asset pool is resisted
by the husband.
279 The assets which the wife asserts should be excluded from the asset pool
are as follows:
(a) $470,000 withdrawn by her from the
Westpac mortgage offset account.
280 The liabilities which the wife asserts should be excluded from the asset
pool are as follows:
(a) land tax of $17,825, even though the
land tax liability is in her name;
(b) anticipated capital gains tax from the sale of Property E and Property
(c) accounting fees of $5,933;
(d) the husband’s PAYG instalment due 31 March 2021 of $130,241;
(e) the capital gains tax from the sale Q Shares.
281 I will address each of the excluded/included assets and liabilities.
Assets which the husband seeks to add back into the asset pool
282 The husband seeks that the sum of $470,000
being the funds the wife unilaterally drew from the Westpac mortgage offset
should be added back into the asset pool, together with her legal fees
paid to date of $346,241.
283 The wife submits that the legal fees paid to date were paid from the
$470,000 withdrawn by her and that to include both amounts
284 She submits that her legal fees of $346,241 should be included in the
asset pool and that the balance of the funds withdrawn,
namely $124,000 should
not be added into the asset pool as she expended those funds in a reasonable
manner, and in particular to
support herself.
285 There was no explanation given by the husband why he would seek to add
back amounts expended from the $470,000 withdrawn, so that
the wife would be
penalised both in terms of the add back of the funds withdrawn and the payment
of legal fees.
286 I intend to add back into the asset pool the wife’s legal fees of
$346,241 and in doing so I have regard to the principles
referred to in
[2004] FamCA 633
(2004) FLC 93-204
Chorn & Hopkins
and discussed in
Trevi & Trevi
[2018] FamCAFC 173.
287 In relation to the differential between legal fees and the funds
withdrawn, which is approximately $124,000, the wife submits
that these funds
have been properly spent and should not be added back into the asset pool.
288 Paragraph 199 of the wife’s trial affidavit sets out her
expenditure of the balance of the funds. She deposes that the funds
expended as follows:
(a) $30,000 for children’s expenses
including school requirements, medical and psychologist fees, school fees for
College near
Property P, which the husband refused to pay;
(b) $34,000 for repairs and maintenance to the Property P property;
(c) approximate $3,000 for the insurance policy for the Property P property;
(d) $10,000 on travelling to Indonesia with the children in 2019;
(e) $20,000 on further travel with the children since separation;
(f) the balance was spent on the children’s and her living
289 In his final address, Queen’s Counsel for the wife submitted that
the wife was not challenged about:
(a) the cost of repairs and maintenance to
the Property P property, only whether or not the expenses claimed were repairs
or replacement
of capital item;
(b) her living expenses having been profligate or out of kilter with the type of
lifestyle the parties enjoy during the
290 The issue of addbacks was considered by the Full Court of this court
Vass & Vass
[2015] FamCAFC 51
and recently approved in
[2021] FamCAFC 60.
291 Whether or not funds are added back into the asset pool, or taking into
consideration pursuant to
is a matter of discretion for the trial
judge. In this matter, I consider that the wife has appropriately explained the
dissipation
of the funds and was not challenged in this regard. I do not intend
to add back the funds so expended, however I will take into consideration
pursuant to
the funds expended by the wife on travel with the
292 I do not intend to add back into the asset pool $470,000 plus the legal
fees of $346,241, as to do so would result in double counting.
There was no
explanation from the husband’s counsel why he would seek to do so in
circumstances where it is clearly wrong.
293 The husband also sought to add back into the asset pool the sum of
$56,736 which the wife withdrew from her superannuation account
in June 2019 and
September 2020. Queen’s Counsel for the wife submitted that the funds so
withdrawn were reflected in the wife’s
account balances in her Westpac
choice, Westpac E saver and CBA account, all of which have been added into the
asset pool. But for
the withdrawal of those funds the balances in those accounts
would have been significantly less and to add back the funds withdrawn
superannuation account would again be double counting. I accept that submission
and do not intend to add back the funds
withdrawn from the wife’s
superannuation account.
Assets which the husband asserts should not be added back into
the asset pool
294 The husband seeks to exclude his legal fees
from the asset pool, on the basis that the fees were paid from personal
Clearly, the principles in
Chorn & Hopkins
which relate to
the treatment of paid legal fees, and in particular, that legal fees which have
been paid from funds generated by
a party post separation from his or her own
endeavours should not be added back, would indicate that the husband’s
should be excluded from the asset pool and considered pursuant to
Chorn & Hopkins
makes it clear it is ultimately a
matter for the discretion of the trial judge.
295 Queen’s Counsel for the wife submitted:
(a) the principles in
emphasise that add back of legal fees is ultimately an exercise of
discretion;
(b) the husband could not substantiate that the legal fees had been paid out of
income earned post separation because:
(i) each of the four Financial
Statements that he swore throughout the course of the proceedings were put to
the husband;
(ii) each of the four Financial Statements showed a significant deficit between
income and expenditure;
(iii) none of them referred to payment of legal fees as comprising part of his
expenditure;
(iv) the expenditure referred to in the documents was for normal living
expenses, and maintaining the family, and according to the
statements the family
since separation had been spending more than he had been earning;
(v) in the context of that evidence, the husband is not able to argue that the
expenses have been paid out of income post separation;
(vi) the amount paid by the husband for his legal expenses should therefore be
added back into the asset
296 I accept that the submissions of Queen’s Counsel for the wife are
persuasive, particularly in the context of the allegations
against the husband
intend to take into account, pursuant
the legal fees paid by the
husband, and do not intend to add the fees back into the asset pool.
Liabilities which the husband seeks to include in the asset
297 The husband seeks to include in the asset pool
a land tax assessment in the wife’s name and anticipated capital gains tax
which will crystallise upon the sale of the Property E and Property M
properties.
298 The wife resists inclusion of these liabilities in the asset pool on the
basis that the land tax will be deducted by the purchaser
at settlement and to
include in the asset pool would again be double counting.
299 With respect to the capital gains tax, the minute of proposed orders
which has been submitted by the wife takes into consideration
the issue of
capital gains tax which will accrue for both parties subsequent to the sale of
the properties. To include the capital
gains tax as a liability in the asset
pool, if I were to adopt that minute would result in double counting of the
capital gains tax
as a liability. Additionally, it is not possible to accurately
estimate the extent of the capital gains tax liability arising from
the sale of
the two properties. There was no direct or precise evidence in that regard,
particularly because of the large differential
in value of the Property E
property. During the trial both parties agreed that the property would be sold
and the wife therefore
did not seek to cross-examine the valuer of the property.
300 I intend to adopt the minute as proposed by the wife, in relation to the
sale of Property E and Property M, and therefore do not
intend to include
capital gains tax which are payable from the sale of both those properties in
the asset pool.
301 With respect to the capital gains tax arising from the sale of Q Shares,
I accept the husband would ultimately be liable for payment
of this amount,
because he will retain the Stanton Family Trust. The only evidence as to the
quantum of capital gains tax is annexure
-9 to the husband’s affidavit of
19 March 2021. It would have been preferable if the husband had prepared an
affidavit from
Mr VV of WW accounting firm, his accountants rather than adduce
evidence in this manner. However, I intend to make orders that this
should be paid from the proceeds of the Property E property, once it has been
properly calculated by an accountant and
the quantum agreed upon by the parties
and do not intend to also include it in the asset pool.
302 The husband is seeking to include as a joint liability his accounting
fees, which he asserts have been incurred to obtain an estimate
of capital gains
tax. The wife submits that each party will need to obtain accounting advice as
to the anticipated capital gains
tax and that each party should be responsible
for their own accounting fees. I agree with the wife submission that each party
incur accounting fees to enable their capital gains tax liabilities to be
ascertained, and it is preferable that each will be responsible
for that, once
the properties have sold and proper advice can be obtained. I do not intend to
include accounting fees as a liability
in the asset pool. I will take that
liability into account, pursuant to
s 75(2)(o).
303 The husband seeks that his PAYG instalment of $130,241 due 31 March 2021
should be included as a liability in the asset pool.
304 The wife resists for the inclusion of that liability on the following
(a) it is plain from the evidence that the
husband is paying more in weekly and quarterly tax than the actual income he is
would suggest he would have to pay if he were reporting quarterly and
paying quarterly;
(b) his most recent financial statement sworn 23 March 2021 deposes to a weekly
income of $14,076 and weekly tax payments of $10,770;
(c) the figures deposed to in his financial statement cannot possibly be correct
and the husband is obviously paying more than he
is required to pay;
(d) in the financial year ending 30 June 2020 he received a tax refund of
$206,000 which was not disclosed by the husband in his
documents for the
anticipated trial in September 2020;
(e) to have obtained a tax refund he must have paid more than required;
(f) he has not varied his quarterly payment and amounts for 2021,
notwithstanding that he acknowledged during cross-examination that
he could do
(g) because there is no reliable evidence from the husband of what his actual
income is this year, it is impossible to determine
whether the payment is a
liability which has been actually incurred or whether it will be refunded;
(h) the liability is an artifice and should not be in taken into account in
determining the asset pool;
(i) the husband has access to significant sums of cash which he has withdrawn or
he could seek that the funds he has paid to C SCHOOL
could be released to him.
305 The submissions of the husband do not take into consideration that the
husband has been continuing to earn and accrue income since
the balance sheet
was prepared in March 2021 and will no doubt continue to do so.
306 I do not propose to add this as a liability into the asset pool because
of the uncertainty of the husband’s prepayment of
future tax and his
entitlement to a tax credit, and the additional income he has earned in the
intervening period. I will take it
into consideration pursuant to
s 75(2)(o).
307 In his final written submissions and minutes of proposed orders, the
husband sought that the wife should be responsible for the
$200,000 which she
withdrew from the Westpac rocket Westpac loan account ...28, and that this
amount should be treated as an adjustment
against the wife in the division of
property determined by the court.
308 That submission was made, despite the joint balance sheet in the
husband’s final submissions including, at item 15, the
$200,000 as an
asset of the wife. The amount is also included in the joint balance sheet, at
item 18 as a liability of the wife.
309 In the reply submissions of the wife, Queen’s Counsel for the
husband submits that the statement in the husband’s
written submissions
“to allow the $200,000 on her side of the ledger but put the $200,000
liability as between the parties
is to require Mr Stanton to be liable for a
proportion of this borrowing” is an error of law and incorrect as a
submission.
That is so for the following reasons:
(a) the court cannot include the asset
without the liability;
(b) the husband is not liable for any proportion of the withdrawal as it is 100%
offset by the notional asset of the $200,000 in
cash which the wife has since
applied to payment of legal fees, in which the wife includes on her side of the
balance sheet.
310 I accept the submissions of Queen’s Counsel for the wife and do not
intend to make orders providing that the amount be further
adjusted against the
wife. I accept it has been dealt with appropriately in the joint balance
Assets which the wife seeks to include in the asset pool
311 The wife seeks to include in the asset pool the
sum of $479,221, which the husband has paid to C SCHOOL. The funds were paid by
the husband in February 2021 without her knowledge or consent from the
husband’s CBA account. The relevant statements of that
account are
contained in the wife’s Court book 6 at document one. Document seven in
Court Book 6 is a screenshot of the C SCHOOL
finance portal which demonstrates
the overall credit balance of the husband’s account is $479,221.90, which
is described as
312 An examination of the account establishes that in January and February
2021 the husband transferred into that account significant
funds, which were a
tax refund of $228,000 and the proceeds of sale of Q Shares. I refer to the
circumstances of the husband’s
receipt of the tax refund when considering
the context of the husband’s asserted lack of disclosure.
313 Between Saturday 30 January 2021 and Friday, 5 February 2021 the husband
made fifteen payments of $30,000 each to C SCHOOL from
that account.
314 The husband deposes that the payments were made to enable him to secure
the payment of school fees for the children at C SCHOOL
for the balance of their
education. The benefit of prepayment is that school fees are to be debited at
the rate applicable as at
the date of prepayment, so that future rises in school
fees are avoided.
315 Document 8 of Court Book 6 is an email dated 17 March 2021 from the
Finance Manager at C SCHOOL to the wife which states:
Dear Ms Stanton,
A payer can request for a refund of any payments made in advance that have not
been allocated to tuition or ancillary charges.
316 In relation to whether the prepaid school fees could be refunded to the
payer, Ms YY, the Finance Manager of C SCHOOL gave evidence
cross-examined by Queen’s Counsel for the wife and Queen’s Counsel
for the husband.
317 Her evidence was as follows:
(a) her recollection of the conversation she
had with the husband on 22 January 2021, was that he called to see whether the
could be withdrawn from the school, as he wanted to make sure no one could
access the account and that he would need to approve any
withdrawals from the
(b) she recalled a telephone conversation with the husband on 11 March 2021 that
she had mentioned to him, that the wife had made
retrieve the fee statement information;
(c) relation to a further conversation on 11 March 2021, she recalled the
husband had said don’t divulge any information and
he was the account
holder, and she assumed
she couldn’t withdraw any funds;
(d) she agreed that the husband’s expressed central concern, was that the
wife should not be able to withdraw any amounts;
(e) she confirmed with him orally, that the wife would not be able to withdraw
any amounts;
(f) she recorded that withdrawals would not be permitted without the
husband’s approval;
(g) in response to the proposition that if the husband gave permission the funds
could be withdrawn, she said that the school policy
was that funds would be
refunded, if not allocated to school tuition, to the person who had paid in
318 Subsequent to the evidence of Ms Y Queen’s Counsel for the wife
resumed his cross-examination of the husband. Despite Ms
YY’s evidence,
the husband refused to acknowledge that the $479,000 which he had paid to the
school would be available for
distribution between the parties. He would not
accept the proposition that C SCHOOL could refund the money and instead made
to the fact that Ms YY was seeking authority from the IT
department.
319 His evidence in this regard was at best disingenuous. It was obvious that
the husband was concerned with the wife accessing the
portal and being able to
withdraw funds.
320 It is clear from Ms YY’s evidence that all the husband would have
to do would be to make the request of C SCHOOL for a return
of the funds and C
SCHOOL would comply. It is for this reason that the wife seeks that the funds be
included in the asset pool as
an asset, rather than an addback.
321 I agree that the funds should be treated as an asset currently available
for distribution between the parties and there is no
need to consider the issue
of the funds as an addback. However, if I am mistaken in this regard, then
applying the discretionary
principles of addbacks referred to in
then it would be appropriate to include the funds as an addback into
the asset pool.
Liabilities which the wife asserts should be excluded from the
322 I have addressed the liabilities which the wife
asserts should be excluded from the asset pool at paragraphs 297 to 310 hereof,
in the context of the husband’s assertion that the liability should be

(b) and (c)
Assets at the commencement
of the relationship
husband asserts that cohabitation commenced in January 1999, whereas the wife
asserts that cohabitation commenced in September
1998. Neither party was
challenged about the date of cohabitation and for the purposes of a division of
property, given the relatively
brief timeframe between the two asserted dates,
it is not of major significance.
325 At the commencement of cohabitation the husband asserts that he had the
following assets:
(a) shares and cash of around $200,000;
(b) a car worth around $25,000;
(c) other assets of around $15,000 including superannuation and
326 The husband asserts that the wife had the following assets at the
commencement of cohabitation:
(a) a car worth around $10,000;
(b) cash of around $2,000;
(c) other assets of around $5,000 including superannuation and
327 The wife asserts that neither she nor the husband had assets of
significance at the commencement of cohabitation.
328 The husband’s submissions acknowledge that neither party has any
evidence to support or refute their claims about the assets
at the commencement
of the relationship.
Contributions during the relationship
329 The husband’s evidence is that from the
commencement of the relationship he worked full-time as a registered medical
professional.
After the marriage, he completed extensive training in at a
hospital in S City , where he was paid a basic salary which covered rent.
the balance of living expenses from funds he had accumulated in Australia.
330 Upon the parties returned to Australia in 2001 he worked full-time as a
medical professional and his income accelerated approximately
$100,000 a year
over the next 10 years, whereupon it stabilised at the current level of
approximately $1 million per annum.
331 At the commencement of the relationship, the wife worked as a health
professional from 1998.Whilst they lived in S City she worked
in administration
and upon the couple’s return to Australia in 2001 she returned to being a
health professional until 2002.
Subsequent to that, she worked as office manager
for her husband’s business. After the birth of their first child Y in
the wife continued to work from home.
332 The wife’s evidence about the respective employment of each of them
during the relationship substantially accords with the
333 The wife’s evidence is that she was working as a health
professional at the ZZ Medical Centre until 1999 when she agreed
to relinquish
her employment and moved to S City with the husband. She was unable to work as a
health professional in S City without
requalifying and for approximately 2 to 3
months she was unable to work without a working Visa. She then obtained a job in
prior to being offered a job as a full-time receptionist which she
334 According to the wife, the husband’s wage from his work in S City
paid for the rent and they otherwise lived from her income.
The couple returned
to Australia in May 2001, whereupon the wife obtained employment as a health
professional for about four months.
From June 2001, she commenced working
part-time for the husband, which increased to full-time work in October
335 She attended to preparation of the husband’s BAS and annual tax
returns, did his billing and typing. From 2001 until separation,
notionally paid to her by the husband to utilise her lower marginal tax
336 The husband was the primary breadwinner during the relationship and
worked long hours, including working on both Saturdays and
337 The wife was primarily responsible for the care of the children and
managing the running of the family household.
338 During the trial the parties seemed to agree that the contributions from
the date of cohabitation until separation are equal.
However, the
husband’s written submissions attempt to elevate his contributions during
the relationship with statements such
as the wife had little or no income and
his training in S City enabled him to earn the very large salary he has earned
time, which enabled him to provide financially for the family to
accumulate over $10 million in assets.
Post separation Contributions
339 Post separation, the husband has continued to
work as a medical professional and has earned substantial income. He has
contributed
to the financial support of the family, including payment of joint
liabilities, mortgage repayments, rates and insurances, school
fees at C SCHOOL,
registration insurance and maintenance costs in relation to the wife’s
car, spousal maintenance to the wife
of $2,000 per month and periodic child
support as assessed.
340 The wife ceased her employment with the husband shortly after separation
and has thereafter obtained employment in an administrative
capacity for a
sports association. She has applied her limited income to support herself and
the children.
341 The wife asserts that the post separation contributions are also equal,
as each party continues their respective roles which they
had prior to
separation, albeit in different households.
342 The husband asserts in his final written submissions that his
contributions post separation are superior to those of the wife.
His evidence is
that he used his line of credit, his earnings profit from share trading and tax
and $479,000 in prepayment of school fees.
He further submits that:
(a) these monies, if not paid might have
been an asset that would have been a post separation asset, to which the wife
made no contribution;
(b) his post separation income has been earned by him and he has supported the
wife and children from his income;
(c) it is not just and equitable to ignore his contributions to the add backs
the wife seek without considering her contribution
to those assets;
(d) whilst the wife had the major care of the children, her needs were almost
completely met by the husband’s earnings;
(e) in those circumstances, it was submitted that these assets should be treated
separately and his contributions 100% such that
he retain those notionally added
back assets without adjustment.
(4)(d),(e),(f) and (g) and the
Section 75(2)
Section 79(4)(d):
the effect of any proposed order upon the
earning capacity of either party to the marriage.
343 The orders which I
propose to make will not have any effect on the earning capacity of either
Section 79(4)(e):
the matters referred to in
section 75(2)
so far as they are relevant
344 The husband is 53 years old and enjoys good
health. He works full-time as a medical professional and earns a very
substantial
income. For the last year prior to Covid-19, the husband’s
income was $1,370,000 and for the two years prior to that his income
$1,249,000 and $1,199,000 respectively. He will continue to work as a medical
professional and the parenting orders I intend
to make will not impact on his
income earning capacity in any manner whatsoever.
345 The wife is aged 50 and enjoys reasonable health. She has had a number of
health issues in the past including being involved in
a serious car accident in
2008, when she was hospitalised for three months and broke nearly every bone in
346 The wife is currently earning somewhere around $30,000-$35,000 per annum
in an administrative job for a local sporting association
and is hopeful of
securing a slightly better job with Business AAA where she estimates that her
income may be in the vicinity of
possibly $60,000 - $70,000 per annum.
347 The husband’s income earning capacity is approximately 20 times
that of the wife.
348 The husband’s evidence is that the wife could obtain a job as a
health professional and earn $150,000 per annum. I do not
accept that evidence,
particularly as the wife has not actively worked as a health professional since
1999, except for a couple of
months in 2001 upon their return from S City, and
is not a registered health professional. The wife’s evidence is that she
maintained her registration as a health professional while she was employed by
the husband but she has subsequently let that lapse.
Furthermore, her evidence
was that she would be physically incapable of working a health professional as a
result of the injuries
she sustained in the car accident in 2008. I prefer the
evidence of the wife to that of the husband in this regard and accept that
wife’s earning capacity, at best, would be in the vicinity of
$60,000-$70,000 per annum.
349 Additionally, the orders which I intend to make will provide for the
children to be in the wife’s care the majority of the
time and she will be
responsible for her obligations and commitments to the children in terms of
their extensive sporting commitments
and for Child X’s needs, particularly
in the context of the order which I intend to make for the wife to have sole
responsibility in relation to health matters.
350 As submitted by Queen’s Counsel for the husband, the two most
significant factors are the wife’s ongoing substantial
care of the
children and the significant earning disparity. I agree with that submission.
351 The husband submitted that there should be no adjustment on the basis of
future needs because of the following reasons:
(a) the significant capital sum the wife is
likely to receive which on the husband’s assessment would be in excess of
$5 million;
(b) the wife’s evidence during cross-examination of the capacity of her
mother to pay for the upkeep of Property P as she was
wealthy and would help her
(c) the possibility of her receiving an early inheritance from her mother;
(d) the wealth of her mother and her ability to assist the wife is relevant to
an assessment as to her future resources;
(e) the wife’s alleged evidence that she would be able to earn $150,000
352 The wife submissions in reply address the wife’s evidence as to her
mother’s wealth. That evidence was given by the
wife in relation to the
repeated propositions put to her by the husband’s Queen’s Counsel
that she would not be able
to afford to maintain the Property P property, and
not in a context as is submitted by the husband. There was no evidence about any
past or future proposals for the wife’s mother to assist her with any
other financial support other than the costs of maintaining
Property P, if the
wife did not have the funds to do so herself. The wife’s evidence was in
response to a very specific proposition,
and not generally that she had access
to ongoing financial resources from her mother.
353 Similarly, there was no proposition put to the wife that her mother was
unwell or unable to change her will. It was submitted
that the issue of her
mother’s wealth is therefore irrelevant (
White & Tulloch &
(1995) FLC 92-640).
354 I do not accept the submissions on behalf of the husband that there are
no significant
(2) factors which would warrant any adjustment in the
wife’s favour, because of the size of the asset pool. The fact that the
husband’s income is around 20 times that of the wife and that she has the
majority of care of three children, are highly relevant
factors to warrant an
adjustment for future needs.
355 I intend to make an order that the wife retain the Property P property,
as she wishes to do. An appropriate adjustment of the
asset pool, depending on
the sale price of the properties, will result in a cash payment to the wife. I
do not accept the submissions
of the husband, that to rely on the wife retaining
a substantial asset, namely the Property P property, as part of her property
settlement,
would necessitate her receiving additional cash to address her
future needs, should be regarded as “double dipping”.
I have based
my decision on the relevant factors to determine the wife’s future needs,
not how much over and above the value
of Property P she should receive to
maintain herself.
(4)(f) and (g)
356 The parenting orders in relation to the
children and child support issues are referred to elsewhere in these reasons.
Section 75(2)(o):
any fact or circumstance which in the
opinion of the Court, the justice of the case requires to be taken into
357 There are a number of matters which the parties
have submitted are relevant and should be taken into account pursuant to this
section of the
358 The wife asserts that the husband’s failure to adequately disclose
is a matter which should be taken into consideration
when adjusting property
interests between them. In support of that contention the wife relies on the
husband’s failure to disclose
the following:
(a) his tax refund of $206,921 which he did not disclose
prior to the anticipated September 2020 trial;
(b) the payment by him of $479,221 withdrawn from his CBA account in February
2021, which he ultimately paid to C SCHOOL;
(c) the cash withdrawal from the husband’s Bank O account of $130,000;
(d) cash withdrawals from the Bank O account of approximately $240,000;
(e) the payment of $325,000 from the asset pool into the superannuation pool,
without prior disclosure to the wife.
359 I will address each allegation in turn.
360 Firstly, the failure to disclose his anticipated tax refund.
361 On 28 August 2020, the husband’s accountant, Mr VV partner of WW
accounting firm, , forwarded a letter to the husband enclosing
the financial
reports package for the tax year ended 30 June 2020. A copy of that letter is
document 2 in the wife’s Court
Book 4. The letter provides an
estimate of the final income tax which would arise when the tax returns for the
husband personally
and the Stanton Family Trust were assessed.
362 In relation to the husband’s personal income tax, his accountants
estimated that he would receive as a refund the sum of
$206,921.29. The letter
was not disclosed by the husband and was produced by the husband’s
accountants pursuant to a subpoena
issued by the wife on 21 September
363 The husband was cross-examined about the anticipated tax return and his
failure to disclose the tax refund as an asset in his
Financial Statement which
was sworn on 20 September 2020, in anticipation of the trial which was
originally scheduled for 19 October
364 His evidence was that that he did not get around to looking at the
documents until January 2021, as he was too busy and the tax
returns were not
required to be lodged until 2021. He denied that as at 20 September 2020, the
date of his Financial Statement, he
was aware that if he had lodged his tax
returns he would be entitled to a tax refund of around $200,000. His evidence
(a) he was not sure that he had seen the
letter before, as he did not recall receiving a letter from the accountant but
it could possibly
have been emailed to him;
(b) he did not recollect receiving the document as he had a lot on and his tax
had not yet been finalised;
(c) he had never discussed the letter;
(d) in response to the proposition that he knew in August 2020 that he had
earned hundreds of thousands of dollars less than the
previous tax year, was
that he hadn’t done the equations and he paid tax at the rate he was
paying tax instalments;
(e) in response to the proposition that he knew he would not be paying tax of
$10,000 per week with an income of $16,000 per week,
was that that his tax would
be finalised at the end of the year;
(f) he agreed that he lodged his tax return in January 2021 and received a
credit of $205,723;
(g) he denied that in August 2020 he knew he would receive such a sum;
(h) he denied that he knew by 15 September 2020 that he was in credit with the
tax office to the extent of $289,901 in his integrated
tax account, but rather
he knew that he paid his tax is assessed based on his prior earnings;
(i) he agreed that he had promptly paid the bill from his accountants dated
28 August 2020, which is exhibit
365 I do not accept the husband’s evidence that he was unaware of the
anticipated tax refund as at September 2020. The husband
impressed me as
incredibly precise and knowledgeable about his affairs and to accept that he did
not read either an email or letter
from his accountant enclosing his draft
Financial Statements upon receipt in September 2020 is inherently implausible.
implausible that he promptly paid an account for preparation of
Financial Statements, which clearly indicated that the anticipated
was around $200,000, without reading the cover letter from his accountants, nor
bothering to look at the draft statements
until the January 2021 holidays. I
find that the husband was aware of the anticipated tax refund, as at September
2020 and that he
did not disclose that in anticipation of the trial scheduled
for 19 October 2020, nor was it disclosed voluntarily by the husband
lawyers. The information was obtained pursuant to the subpoena addressed to his
accountants, issued by the solicitors for
the wife on 21 September 2020. I also
find that the husband did not comply with his disclosure obligations in this
366 The husband received a further tax credit of $28,000 which was a refund
of overpaid tax.
367 Secondly, the payment to C SCHOOL. As referred to previously, the payment
to C SCHOOL was made by the husband from funds received
from the tax refund and
the sale of Q shares. The husband did not disclose to the wife that he intended
to make the payment or directly,
that he had done so.
368 The solicitors for the wife discovered the payment to C SCHOOL through a
series of requests for the husband’s bank statements.
Court Books 4 and 6 contain a series of letters between the parties’
solicitors for the parties. Document
3 in the wife’s Court Book 6 is a
letter from the wife’s solicitors to the husband’s solicitors dated
2021 seeking statements of the husband’s CBA direct
investment account from 13 September 2020 to that date. Document 22 in
Book 4 is a letter dated 24 February 2021 from the wife’s solicitors
to the husband’s solicitors seeking copies
of further bank statements and
in particular seeking documents evidencing the application of various
transactions from the husband’s
Westpac account in January and February
2021, with the notation, “Comsec”. Document 2 in Court Book 6 is a
letter from
Mills Oakley to the wife’s solicitors dated 9 March 2021
advising that the funds in the Westpac account with the notation
$269,900 were deposited into the CBA bank account and
enclosing the relevant statements. Document 10 in Court Book 4 is a copy letter
dated 18 March 2021 from the husband’s solicitors to the wife’s
solicitors providing updated financial disclosure.
369 Queen’s Counsel for the wife cross-examined the husband about
whether he thought he should have disclosed to the wife that
he had prepaid
$479,000 of school fees to C SCHOOL. His was response was that he did not think
that he was required to disclose the
same and that it was not necessary to do
so, as he had been instructed to pay the girls school fees by Court orders.
370 During cross-examination the husband professed to be unable to recall
from which account he had paid $479,000 to C SCHOOL, despite
him having made 15
transactions in 5 days between the end of January and early February 2021. His
explanation for the multiple transactions
was that C SCHOOL could only accept
payment of $30,000 at a time and that he did not intend any sinister
371 The husband’s evidence about why he had prepaid the C SCHOOL fees,
when that had never been a past practice was that he
wanted to secure the
children’s education because of the significant costs he had incurred,
presumably in the proceedings,
and that he was concerned he would not have
sufficient funds to pay the fees and because of his potential reduced earning
and that he wanted to secure the children’s future
372 Queen’s Counsel for the wife submitted that the purpose of the
prepayment of fees was to reduce the asset pool of funds
available for
distribution between the parties. I do not accept the husband’s evidence
fees and his lack of candour and disclosure
leads to the conclusion submitted by Queen’s Counsel for the wife, and I
find accordingly.
373 Thirdly, I will address the husband’s withdrawal of $130,000 from
his Bank O account. The husband’s Financial Statement
sworn in September
2020 in anticipation of the trial then scheduled for 19 October 2020, does not
disclose any account with Bank
O. At page 11, item 37 of the Financial Statement
the husband refers to an account with Westpac. During cross-examination, the
conceded that he had a Bank O account in September 2020, however he had
subsequently closed that account during Covid-19 because
the branch at near his
work had been closed and he had no access to a local branch.
374 On 21 September 2020, the wife’s solicitors issued a subpoena to
the husband’s accountant, which disclosed the existence
of the Bank O
account, because the interest which had accrued in the account was reflected in
the working papers of the husband’s
proposed Financial Statements. The
husband conceded he was aware of that and subsequently on 7 October 2020 his
solicitors wrote
to the wife’s solicitors, Document 4 in the wife’s
Court Book 4, which included the following statement:
Finally, our client has instructed us he holds a further
bank account with Bank O being BSB ...99 with the balance of $15,848.22.
screenshot in relation to that account is enclosed.
375 The husband denied that the only reason he had disclosed the account was
because he knew it would be disclosed in the documents
produced by his
accountants. His evidence was that he noted that his bookkeeper had omitted it
and that there was nothing sinister
in that omission.
376 On 21 October 2020, orders were made by consent for the husband to
disclose, within 14 days the statements of two Bank O accounts
from the date the
account was opened to present. The documents were not disclosed and on 10
February 2021 the wife’s lawyers
issued a subpoena to Bank O.
377 On 18 February 2021, the husband’s solicitors forwarded a letter to
the wife’s solicitors enclosing the documents
which should have been
disclosed pursuant to the orders of 21 October 2020. During
cross-examination, in response to a proposition
that the only reason the
documents was produced was because he knew the wife would obtain them pursuant
to the subpoena, the husband’s
evidence was that there were two reasons
that he had failed to comply with the October 2020 orders, which were:
(a) latency in supplying information to his
lawyers; and
(b) he had difficulty accessing the account because the account had been closed
and he would need to go to the Street BBB branch,
that is not how he retrieved
the statements.
378 The husband conceded that the delay in providing the documents up until
early February 2021 was probably his responsibility.
379 Copies of the statements are Document 18 in the wife’s Court Book
4. On 3 August 2020, the husband withdrew the sum of $130,000
cash from the
above account. The husband’s evidence during cross-examination about the
circumstances of the withdrawal was:
(a) he was not as busy as normal in August
2020 because he was affected by Covid-19;
(b) he personally went to the Street BBB branch and withdrew that amount in cash
although he was unable to recall the denominations;
(c) in response to when was the last time he withdrew $100,000 in cash, his
response was that he could not recall;
(d) he did not see why it would be memorable because he was unable to transfer
the funds electronically due to a transfer limit,
so he could not transfer the
funds electronically and it was just prior to a permanent closure of the branch
and opening of his ANZ
(e) he probably made the withdrawal after work, put the cash into a plastic
Coles bag, drove it to his parents and handed it over,
probably to his mother
because his father’s dementia has accelerated;
(f) he agreed there was no legal obligation to help his parents but he felt a
moral obligation to assist;
(g) in response to the proposition that if the funds had not been given to his
mother, they would be available for distribution between
himself and the wife,
he stated it was money he had earned in the months prior;
(h) he agreed that his Financial Statement sworn in September 2020 on page 17 at
, under the heading “Disposal of Property” did not disclose
the disposal of the cash, although he had referred to savings,
the purchase of a
Motor vehicle 2 and sale of a Motor vehicle 4;
(i) he did not think that cash was property because it was not a physical entity
such as a car or house, and that was why it had
not been included;
(j) it was his understanding that if he had given money away he did not need to
disclose it;
(k) he understood property as a physical asset;
(l) he was unable to explain why, if that were the case that he had explained
the application of cash to purchase a Motor vehicle
2, other than the document
was filled out by his lawyers;
(m) in response to the question how he was going to advise the wife that he had
given the cash, he said he had provided the screenshots;
(n) he was not going to comment about the withdrawal of cash unless
“they” asked;
(o) he was not sure if an explanation of the $130,000 with cash withdrawal had
appeared in any of his three trial affidavits;
(p) he agreed that the first time he had disclosed the Bank O account was on 18
February 2021 in a letter from his solicitors, despite
the order in October 2020
requiring him to do so.
380 I do not accept that the husband’s evidence during
cross-examination about why he did not disclose the Bank O accounts,
particular the cash withdrawal of $130,000. It is inconceivable that the husband
was not aware that he would be obliged to
disclose a cash withdrawal of
$130,000, during the course of the proceedings. In his final written
submissions, it was submitted
that the Bank O account was closed in about
September 2020 and it was not referred to in his Financial Statement affirmed 20
2020, as the account had been closed at that time. The reply
submissions of the wife point out that the account was closed on 1 October
as evidenced by the document at page 57 of the wife’s Court book number 4,
which was subsequent to the husband affirming
his trial affidavit and his
Financial Statement. His attempts to explain away his lack of candour are
frankly unbelievable and lead
to the irresistible conclusion that the cash was
withdrawn to minimise the asset pool for distribution between the parties. I
accordingly.
381 Fourthly, I will address the cash withdrawals made by the husband from
the Bank O account.
382 The husband was cross-examined about the pattern of cash withdrawals from
the Bank O account. His evidence was:
(a) he agreed that throughout 2019 the
statements demonstrated a pattern of regular deposits and modest
withdrawals;
(b) he agreed that the pattern of withdrawals in the period leading up to April
2020 was very different from the period prior to
April 2020 and that the
difference appeared to be cash withdrawals;
(c) subsequent to April 2020 there were significant cash withdrawals in $1000
(d) he accepted that between 28 August 2018 and 9 February 2021 there were total
cash withdrawals of the $375,000 from his Bank O
account, but he had not
actually looked;
(e) as he had previously paid all of his accounts and expenditure with credit
cards, he did not want his expenditure scrutinised
and paid for his personal
expenses, including payments to his parents and bookkeeper via cash
withdrawals.
383 In the context of my comments about the husband’s evidence
pertaining to withdrawal of $130,000 in cash from the Bank O
account, I find
that the husband deliberately chose to make cash withdrawals from his Bank O
account during the relevant period,
so that it would be impossible to trace
during the course of this proceeding his expenditure from that account. There
was no attempted
explanation of any of the withdrawals other than some
withdrawals were paid to his secretary and he professed not to be able to
the majority of these withdrawals. His evidence in this regard was
highly unimpressive.
384 Fifthly I will address the contribution of $350,000 into the wife’s
superannuation fund.
385 In August 2017, the husband made a contribution of $325,000 in to the
wife’s superannuation, without consulting or advising
the wife. The
wife’s evidence was that on 16 August 2017 she received a notice from her
superannuation fund advising her, that
subsequent to separation, the husband had
made a non-concessional contribution to her superannuation fund of $325,000,
without her
consent or knowledge.
386 The husband’s evidence was that he acknowledged making the
contribution as asserted by the wife, however he did not address
why he failed
to inform her about the payment. He attempted to justify the payment on the
basis that he had made a similar payment
of $450,000 into his own superannuation
in the previous year, prior to separation, because of surplus income following
the repayment
of the home loans, and that it was
astute and responsible
estate/tax planning.
387 Irrespective of whether it was a financially prudent payment, after
separation the husband should have informed the wife of his
intention to make
the payment. The failure to inform the wife lends credence to her complaints
Relevant legal principles
388 The Full Court in
listed the relevant authorities of the law to be applied and
the approach that may be adopted where the court is unable to determine
extent of the parties’ wealth, because of a lack of a full and frank
disclosure.
389 The Full Court (Bryant CJ, Finn and Boland JJ) in
[2007] FamCA 609
, set out the correct approach to be taken in relation
to a failure to comply with the disclosure requirements. After considering
authorities, including
Kannis & Kannis
[2002] FamCA 1150
”), at [26]-[27] the Full Court set out the correct
[26] While the decision of the Full Court (and indeed
also of Holden CJ) in
confirms the earlier decisions which were
cited by the Full Court and which establish that a robust approach can be taken
court in cases of non-disclosure, neither that decision, nor any of the
earlier decisions cited, would, in our view, support the
approach which the
trial Judge in this case took in paragraph 24 of his reasons for judgment, being
to reduce his assessment of the
husband’s contributions of account of the
husband’s non-disclosure.
[27] Rather the appropriate approach for his Honour to have adopted in this case
would have been to have increased the asset pool
to take account of
non-disclosure by the husband, and indeed his Honour had already done this to
some extent in accepting the schedule
of assets prepared by the wife’s
Counsel (see also paragraphs 12 and 14 of his Honour’s reasons).
Alternatively, or even
in addition, had his Honour been persuaded that on the
balance of probabilities there existed assets other than those contained in
asset pool contained in his reasons, his Honour could have made some adjustment
in favour of the wife on account of the husband’s
non-disclosure pursuant
to the provisions of
, as did Holden CJ in
, the Full court emphasised the “absolute”
nature of the duty to disclose and stated at [51]:
[51] Whether the non-disclosure is wilful or accidental,
is a result of misfeasance, or malfeasance or nonfeasance, is beside the
The duty to disclose is absolute. Where the Court is satisfied the whole truth
has not come out it might readily conclude
that the asset pool is greater than
demonstrated. In those circumstances it might be appropriate to err on the side
of generosity
to the party who might be otherwise be seen to be disadvantaged by
the lack of complete candour.
391 The Full Court in
Jamine & Jamine (No.2)
[2012] FamCAFC 104
approved the approach in dismissing an appeal by a husband when the trial judge
found the husband had failed to make full and frank
disclosure, and the wife
received a 5% adjustment in her favour pursuant to
s 75(2)(o).
392 Queen’s Counsel for the wife submitted that the husband’s
failure to properly disclose the matters referred to in
the preceding
paragraphs:
(a) could only lead to the conclusion that
the court is left with the very uncomfortable sense that only part of the story
disclosed by the husband;
(b) it is quite possible that there are various other bank accounts and in
particular because despite an order in October 2020 to
provide a list of bank
accounts to the wife’s solicitors he has never done so;
(c) it is only because of the very targeted efforts of the wife’s
solicitor by asking the right questions that the prepayment
of school fees was
ascertained;
(d) the husband was an incredibly precise witness and that was reflected in his
attitude towards discovery in that only the exact
document asked for, would be
provided when requested;
(e) other documents would not be provided when less precisely requested;
(f) the husband’s conduct left the court with the overarching impression
that there may well be other monies;
(g) the nondisclosure authorities give the court a very broad discretion to make
a further adjustment percentagewise, without having
to justify in a mathematical
way what that percentage adjustment means in dollar terms;
(h) the authorities say that if the husband has not played fair by not telling
the truth, then the court need not be too careful
mathematically.
393 The husband opposes any adjustment pursuant to
non-disclosure for the following reasons:
(a) the wife does not quantify the
adjustment in either percentage or money terms, rather submitting that an
adjustment is a discretionary
did not have to be quantified;
(b) her Case Outline makes no reference to an adjustment on this basis;
(c) during his opening submissions, Queen’s Counsel for the wife referred
to nondisclosure in the context of justifying add
(d) it is not possible for the husband to respond to this issue without him
knowing the case against him;
(e) the wife’s allegations are in relation to nondisclosure of the tax
refund, the $130,000 he gave to his parents, withdrawals
from the Bank O
account, the not-for-profit organisation subpoena giving rise to disclosure and
production of ANZ statements and
the prepayment of school fees and his alleged
failure to disclose any other bank accounts when asked;
(f) there is no evidence of any other assets or bank accounts and the husband
disclosed and provided documents right up to the start
of the trial in the face
of constant and relentless requests;
(g) the husband’s evidence about whether there were any other bank
accounts was that there were not;
(h) the wife has not made out her accusation that the husband has only provided
disclosure of relevant assets when specifically asked;
(i) the fact that matters were disclosed later does not prove an intent to
deceive the court and disclosure problems were mutual;
(j) the wife has failed to provide updated statements for the Property E
mortgage from 1 January 2021 to present and that all she
has provided was a
screenshot of the current balance;
(k) the fact that the husband used cash to make payments for expenses rather
than credit cards does not prove he has assets he has
not disclosed and he
provided an explanation for why he did so;
(l) the amount withdrawn in cash from 28 August 2019 until 19 February 2021 was
$375,000, including $130,000 to his parents, which
is equivalent to $245,000
over 18 months, an average of $13,600 per month;
(m) by comparison his credit card payments before he resorted to withdrawals of
cash were up to $30,000 per month, which is significantly
higher than the cash
withdrawals;
(n) he answered questions about the money he gave to his parents without
hesitation;
(o) in relation to the prepayment of school fees, he denied that he had
instructed the school not to tell the wife about the prepayment
(p) Ms YY gave evidence that her conversations with the husband were about
whether the wife could withdraw the prepaid fees;
(q) the deposits into the wife’s superannuation fund of $300,000 were
planned before separation and was a tax effective contribution;
(r) the discretion to make a nondisclosure adjustment must be based on evidence
and must be exercised fairly and judicially;
(s) the wife’s credit is impugned by the evidence in the case;
(t) it is evident that the wife has a sense of entitlement for as much financial
gain as she can get from the husband and the extent
to which she seeks to
discredit him is evident from her post separation conduct and her evidence and
presentation in cross examination;
(u) the contention that she receive an adjustment for
is more of the
same and should be rejected by the court.
394 I do not accept the submissions of Counsel for the husband, in the
written submissions, in this regards. Specifically the submission
that because
the wife did not refer to such an adjustment in her Case Outline, the husband
was effectively denied the right to respond.
It was abundantly obvious, that
the aim of the cross examination by Queen’s Counsel for the wife which
continued over a number
of days and the documents in court books relied upon by
the her Counsel during cross examination, was both in relation to add back
the asset pool and the husband’s non-disclosure and the laborious process
of the wife’s solicitors to obtain relevant
documentation and discover
disposition of funds. The allegation of non-disclosure was repeatedly put to the
husband during cross-examination
and he answered those questions. It was open
to Queen’s Counsel for the husband to re-examine in this regard to the
he considered necessary.
395 I agree with and accept the submissions of Queen’s Counsel for the
wife and intend to take into consideration, pursuant
husband’s serial non-disclosure, which has been addressed earlier in these
reasons. I cannot be certain that the husband
has made full and frank
disclosure, as he is required to do.
396 There are a number of additional matters which I will also take into
consideration pursuant to this section, relevantly the husband’s
fees, his asserted PAYG tax liability of $130,241, his accounting fees and the
wife’s expenditure on travel with the
children. I have referred to these
matters in my consideration of addbacks to the asset pool.
397 As I have declined to add back into the asset pool the husband’s
legal fees of the $333,460, as referred to earlier in these
reasons, I consider
it appropriate that the payment by the husband of his legal fees from cash flow
be taken into consideration pursuant
to this section of the
. Not to do so
would result in the wife’s legal fees of $346,241 being added back into
the asset pool because they were paid
from capital, whereas the husband has had
the benefit of his significant income which he asserts has enabled him to pay
Discussion and Conclusion as to Contributions
Conclusion as
to Contributions
398 Earlier in these
reasons I refer to the husband’s submissions as to his post separation
contributions in his final written
submissions. There was no attempt to allocate
a percentage of contributions between the parties. However, in the context of
the husband
submissions that it is not just and equitable to make any adjustment
to the wife for
factors, and that he proposes there be an equal division
of their assets
based on a shared care of the children and based on the
factors under
I am entitled to conclude that despite the
submissions that the husband is entitled to a greater share of post separation
that the husband is actually proposing that the contributions of the
parties have been equal.
399 Queen’s Counsel for the wife did not make submissions about the
respective percentage contributions as to initial contribution,
during the marriage and post separation. He submitted that the overall
contributions should be regarded as equal, and
that any suggestion that the
husband is entitled to an additional contribution because of his asserted
initial contributions, should
be considered in the context of the many million
dollars of assets which the parties had accumulated during the years and the
that the wife received a payment of approximately $400,000 from the injury
compensation payment she received following the car accident
in 2008. I agree
with and accept these submissions.
400 As the Full Court said in
Dickons & Dickons
[2012] FamCAFC
[23] We wish also to refer to the approach of the
Federal Magistrate in attributing percentages to differing periods within the
relationship,
or types of contribution made. There is in our view little to be
gained, and much to be said against, approaching the task of assessing
contributions by attaching percentages to components of it. (The same, it might
be said, applies to attributing a percentage to each
of the relevant
[24] There can be little doubt that the classification of contributions by
reference to terms such as "initial contributions", "contributions
relationship", and "post-separation contributions", can be helpful as a
convenient means of giving coherent expression
to the evidence in a
and to giving coherence to the nature, form and extent of the parties'
respective contributions. However, the task of assessing
contributions is
holistic and but part of a yet further holistic determination of what orders, if
any, represent justice and equity
in the particular circumstances of this
particular relationship. So much is clear from the terms of
itself and, in
particular,
The essential task is to assess the nature, form and extent
of the contributions of all types made by each of the parties within
the context
of an analysis of their particular relationship.
401 Having regard to my findings as to contribution and weighing up and
assessing the myriad of contributions of the parties, both
financial and
non-financial, direct and indirect, at the commencement of the relationship,
during the relationship and post separation,
and their contributions as
Discussion and conclusion as to Future Needs
402 Queen’s Counsel for the husband submitted
that there should not be any adjustment under
section 75(2)
because the wife
would receive sufficient capital from her entitlements to a property settlement
to take into account any such matters.
403 As referred to earlier in these reasons, Queen’s Counsel for the
wife submitted that the two most relevant considerations
pertaining to an
adjustment as to future needs are the income disparity of the parties and the
wife’s ongoing care of the children.
Additionally, the husband’s
failure to make proper disclosure and provide a candid account of his financial
affairs warrants
an adjustment in the wife’s favour of 15%, so that she
would be entitled to an overall percentage of 65%.
404 I agree with the submissions of Queen’s Counsel for the wife in
regards to future needs and that there should also be some
adjustment arising
from the husband’s failure to make full and frank disclosure and the
additional matters I have considered
pursuant to
s 75(2)(o).
I consider an
adjustment of 10% of the non-superannuation assets is appropriate for the wife
for future needs, the husband’s
failure to make disclosure having taken
into consideration all relevant factors and the additional matters referred to
in my consideration
factors, including my determination not to add
back into the asset pool the husband’s legal fees in excess of $300,000.
Which party should be entitled to retain the Property P
405 Both the husband and the wife sought to retain
the former family home, being the property situated at Property P. The wife is
the sole registered proprietor of the property and both parties agree it is
currently valued at $5,700,000.
406 The property was purchased for $2,910,000 in October 2006, prior to the
birth of the parties’ eldest daughter, Child Y,
who was born in 2007.
407 During the trial the husband contended that he should be entitled to
retain the property as part of his entitlement to a property
settlement for
three reasons:
(a) the wife is unable to meet the cost of
outgoings and maintenance of the property whereas there is no contention that he
able to do so;
(b) he wishes to construct a granny flat over the garage to house his elderly
(c) there are other properties in the neighbourhood which have granny flats
similar to the one proposed by him and he is confident
he will be able to obtain
the requisite planning permission to construct accommodation for his
408 The wife contends that she should be entitled to retain the property as
part of her entitlement to a property settlement for the
following reasons;
(a) she has continually lived in the
property since its purchase in October 2006;
(b) all of the three girls have lived in the property since their birth and it
is the only home they have known;
(c) she will be able to afford the cost of outgoings of the property either from
her own income, a payment from the property settlement
or with the assistance of
her mother, who has indicated that she will assist the wife;
(d) if she does not receive the property, she will need to purchase a four
bedroom house in either the Property P suburb or a nearby
area, to enable the
children to continue to attend C SCHOOL;
(e) the purchase of another four bedroom home in the area would leave her at a
significant disadvantage because she would then be
required to pay significant
stamp duty on a new property;
(f) the husband does not have any planning permission to construct a granny flat
over the garage, and she considers it unlikely that
he ever will be able to
obtain a planning permit to do so.
409 Remarkably, in his final written submissions the husband asserts that the
court would need to determine the value of the Property
E property prior to
determining which party should retain Property P. That submission was not made
during the trial.
410 The reasons advanced are as follows:
(a) because of the difference in the
valuation of Property E, between the sworn valuation of AA Valuers of $3,380,000
and the wife’s
appraisal of $4,300,000, it is not possible to determine
the ultimate value of the Property E property prior to sale;
(b) on the husband’s balance sheet, which relies on the sworn valuation,
if it is determined that the wife would receive an
equal division of the parties
property, the then the wife would receive less than the value of the Property P
(c) if the court were to determine that the wife were to receive a division of
55% of the property, then on the husband’s balance
sheet she would receive
$232,000 in addition to the Property P
411 The wife was cross-examined at length by Queen’s Counsel for the
husband about her capacity to pay the outgoings and maintenance
of Property P.
She was cross-examined about the cost of effecting repairs for rising damp, in
the context of Property P having been
built on a floodplain, and her evidence in
response was that the parties had done some rising damp works to the house
relationship, however, they had decided not to affect the works in
the front room of the house, which on her estimate would cost
$3,000 to repair.
412 Her evidence was that she would be required to meet outgoings, including
rates, insurances and repairs on any property she may
own and live in, and that
Property P would be the same. She was adamant that she would use her best
endeavours to earn income to
meet her obligations for outgoings and repairs, and
if she could not, her mother whom she described as wealthy, would assist her
pay outgoings and maintain the property. She was also concerned about the issue
of stability of housing for all of the children
and the detrimental effect a
move from their family home may have on the children.
413 She was a scornful about the husband’s prospects of obtaining
planning permission to construct the sort of granny flat which
he had in mind.
414 I have no doubt about the wife’s tenacity to do all things humanly
possible to meet the outgoings and maintenance costs
of the property and I
accept her evidence in that regard.
415 The distribution of property which I intend to make between the husband
and wife should result in the wife receiving in excess
of $5,700,000. I consider
it appropriate that she should be able to retain her home, where she has lived
with the children since
each of their births, and particularly where she has
remained in the house post separation. The fact that the husband seeks to place
the needs of his elderly mother above those of his children, does not
demonstrate any particular insight into his children’s
needs and that it
is likely to be better for them to have continuity and stability of their
416 I did not get the sense that the husband was genuinely seeking to retain
the Property P property, but rather was placing obstacles
in the path of the
wife wishing to retain the property. This is particularly so given that the
husband did not address this issue
in his trial affidavit which was filed in
September 2020 when the matter was first listed for hearing.
417 If he had been genuine about his desire to retain the property, it is
likely he would have addressed that desire in his trial
affidavit and it would
have been prudent to have adduced evidence about attempts he had made to obtain
planning permission to construct
the type of dwelling that he contemplated for
his mother. The best evidence he could come up with was a photograph of the rear
the laneway of the property, which was tendered as exhibit H-5 which
ostensibly showed that there were other properties in the vicinity
constructions over the garage.
418 I do not accept the submissions about the sale of Property E being a
prerequisite to determination of this dispute. Even if the
Property E property
realised the value asserted by the husband, I do not intend to divide the assets
equally between the parties,
as sought by the husband. I also note that the wife
in her Reply submissions conceded that for the purposes of assessing who keeps
the Property P property, the wife concedes the court should use the more
conservative figure for the sale of the Property E property.
Even if that were
the case, then an order could be made for the wife to retain the Property P
property and to make a cash adjustment
to the husband, with a default sale
ordered if she were unable to raise sufficient funds.
419 I also do not accept the husband submissions that the wife should not be
entitled to retain the property should she wish to do
so and that if the court
is not prepared to order that the husband should receive the property, then an
order for its sale should
420 In the circumstances I consider it appropriate that the wife receive the
Property P property as part of her entitlement to a property
settlement.
Cash adjustment sought by the wife in lieu of a superannuation
421 In his final submissions, Queen’s Counsel
for the wife sought that instead of a superannuation split, to equalise the
respective entitlements to superannuation, the wife should receive
a discounted cash payment from the husband. Both parties sought
an equalisation
of superannuation.
422 In order to equalise the respective superannuation entitlements, a
payment of $519,794 would need to be made from the husband’s
superannuation entitlements to those of the wife. In lieu of a superannuation
split, the wife sought a discounted cash payment of
423 There was no substantial reason provided why the wife should receive cash
in lieu of a superannuation split. I agree with the
submissions of the husband
that it is not the usual approach of a court not to split superannuation, and if
that is to be done, the
orders must be just and equitable. In this case both
parties will receive assets of many millions of dollars and are both relatively
young. The wife will have more than enough financial resources to adequately
house herself and the children and provide for her financial
future. There is no
pressing urgency for her to receive additional cash in lieu of a superannuation
split. I do not propose to make
orders in accordance with the wife submissions,
and will make orders providing for an equalisation of the parties combined
superannuation
entitlements.
Adjustment of Interests
424 On the asset pool as determined by me, the wife
will receive a division of assets of 60% of the non-superannuation pool and an
equalisation of the parties combined superannuation entitlements. The husband
will receive a division of assets of 40% of the non-superannuation
pool and an
equalisation of the parties combined superannuation entitlements. Because of the
uncertainty of the sale price of the
Property E property, and the capital gains
tax which arise from the sale of that property and possibly the Property M
property, it
is not possible to calculate with any precision the exact amounts
each of the parties are likely to receive. Additionally, the capital
arising from the sale of the shares will need to precisely calculated and paid
from the proceeds of the Property E property.
425 In his written submissions, the husband asserts that the court must
assess the overall outcome from not only a percentage basis
but from the dollar
value that percentage represents, in order to assess whether it is just and
equitable. In his submissions, the
husband asserts that the wife’s
proposal of a division of 65% of the property pool in her favour, together with
her superannuation
and $450,000 in cash, would result in her receiving
$8,643,117, plus her superannuation of $1,583,937 plus $450,000 cash. Such a
division would result in the wife receiving $10,677,054 and the husband
receiving $6,377,412, which would result in adjustment of
over $4 million to the
wife, which it is submitted would be outside the range.
426 In response to that submission, the wife submissions in reply stated:
(a) the cases referred to by the husband use
the phrase “real money terms” not dollar value;
(b) in cases where there is a sale of certain assets, as is the case here, there
will always be an element of the unknown about the
precise dollars that are
likely to be achieved. That does not mean that courts cannot make orders for
percentage divisions of sale
proceeds of property once received. To do so, would
effectively require two hearings in every case, one to decide whether to sell,
and another to decide a percentage once the pool had been precisely
quantified;
(c) there may be cases where the major asset has a highly contentious value and
the disparity might be enormous, which could significantly
assessment;
(d) in this case, in the context of an asset pool between $15 million
(husband’s approximate pool) and approximate $16.75 million
approximate pool, assuming the husband’s CGT figures and factoring the
additional CGT payable if the wife’s
higher Property E figure is
achieved), the
factors are unlikely to significantly
427 I accept and agree with the submissions of Queen’s Counsel for the
428 In his reply submissions, Queens Counsel for the wife pointed out that
the wife’s pool, adopted by the husband for the calculations
referred to
in the previous paragraph, did not include selling costs of the three properties
in Property E, Property M and Property
H, nor the capital gains tax on the sale
of Property E, Property M, and the shares which were sold by the husband, all of
substantial amounts. On the husband’s own figures the estimated
CGT (on the more conservative estimate of the sale price of
the Property E
property) for Property E, Property M and the shares is $544,750 which would need
to be paid from the sale of Property
E, prior to arriving at the respective
distributions to the parties. Obviously if the realisation price of Property E
the CGT will increase as well as the agent’s commission. The
land tax of $17,825 will also need to be paid from the Property
E sale proceeds.
All of these liabilities will obviously reduce the nett proceeds available for
distribution between the parties.
429 In any event, I do not propose to divide the property as sought by the
wife. As previously stated, I intend to divide the non-superannuation
as to the wife and 40% as to the husband, together with an equalisation of
superannuation. The discrepancy as contemplated
by the husband in his
submissions will not come to pass. I accept the submissions of the wife in
relation to the division of property
referred to at paragraphs 426 and 428
430 The division which I propose to make will result in the wife retaining
the Property P property together with a cash payment from
the proceeds of sale
of the properties to be sold. In the unlikely event there is insufficient cash
realised from the sale of the
Property E, Property M and Property H properties
to enable the wife to retain the Property P property, she will then need to make
a cash payment to the husband to reach the proposed division of assets, if she
wants to retain Property P. The husband will retain
the cash funds in the family
trust and will also receive further cash payments from the proceeds of sale of
the properties.
431 An equalisation of the superannuation entitlements will require a
superannuation split from the husband’s fund to the wife’s
$519,794.50.
432 The wife will retain/receive the following:
(a) Property P($5,700,000)
(b) Westpac Account ($9,835);
(c) Westpac e saver account ($24,485);
(d) CBA account ($36,779);
(e) Motor vehicle 1 ($43,300);
(f) Funds unilaterally withdrawn from Westpac Rocket Loan Property E
($200,000);
(g) Legal fees paid ($346,241);
(h) cash payment from sale of properties (or from the husband if he elects to
retain one or more of the properties) to provide to
her a sum equivalent to 60%
of the non-superannuation asset pool;
(i) her superannuation entitlements ($1,583,937);
(j) a superannuation split from the husband’s fund of
433 The wife will also be required to pay the husband her share of the expert
report fees from her own resources, if there are any
previous orders requiring
her to do so.
434 The husband will retain/receive the following:
(a) cash held in Commsec CBA Direct
Investment account ($1,465,065);
(b) Westpac credit offset account ($13,323);
(c) funds held by C SCHOOL ($479,221);
(d) the Motor vehicle 2 motor vehicle ($157,000);
(e) the Motor vehicle 3 ($60,200);
(f) cash withdrawn from Bank O account ($130,000);
(g) cash payment from sale of properties(or retention of properties, if he
elects to retain one or more of the properties) to provide
to him a sum
equivalent to 40% of the non-superannuation asset pool;
(h) his superannuation entitlements ($2,623,526) less a payment split to the
wife of $519,794.
435 The husband will be liable to pay the asserted PAYG payment and his
accountant’s fees from his own resources.
436 I am satisfied that the proposed division of assets is just and equitable
and I intend to make orders accordingly.
437 I have adopted the formula as set out in the orders proposed by the wife,
except that, as stated in these reasons: I have apportioned
non-superannuation asset pool as to 60% in favour of the wife and 40% in favour
of the husband. I do not propose to make orders
providing for the wife to
receive a cash payment in lieu of a superannuation split. The items which the
wife will retain included
in Item C in the formula are items (a)–(g) of
paragraph 432 hereof. The items which the husband will retain included in Item
of the formula, are items (a)–(g) of paragraph 434 hereof.
438 The proposed orders provide:
(a) for the appointment of selling agents
for Property E, Property H and Property M, which was previously agreed by the
husband and
which are the agents referred to in his minute of proposed
(b) for the parties to continue to use Property E as they have since separation,
except that both parties are to facilitate the sale
(c) a formula for division of the asset pool, if the husband wishes to retain
one or more of the properties;
(d) payment of the liabilities encumbering the properties;
(e) payment of capital gains tax, selling costs and outstanding land tax arising
from the sale of the properties;
(f) payment of capital gains tax from the sale of the shares;
(g) division of chattels from the properties to be sold.
SPOUSAL MAINTENANCE
439 Order 8 of the orders made on 2 August 2018
provide for the husband to pay various expenses on behalf of the wife to
the Property P property pending final settlement.
440 The wife initially asserted that the husband pay to her the sum of
$37,045.98 within seven days, by way of compliance with order
8(b) of the
441 During the course of the trial the wife’s claim was compromised by
agreement between the parties and it was agreed that
the husband pay to the wife
the sum of $5,660.65 within seven days, by way of reimbursement of amounts paid
by the wife in maintaining
the property since separation. The wife’s
proposed minute of order includes a notation that the wife maintains that she
entitled to a higher payment under a proper interpretation of the 2 August
2018 orders, but nevertheless consents to that order.
442 I will make an order accordingly including the notation as sought by the
CHILD SUPPORT DEPARTURE
443 The wife sought a departure from administrative
assessment of child support, so that the husband pay child support to the wife
for each of the children the sum of $380 per child per week increasing with CPI
each year commencing 1 July 2021. That amount is
equivalent to a monthly payment
444 She additionally sought, pursuant to
section 124
Child Support
(Assessment) Act 1989
(Cth), that the husband pay to the wife for the
benefit of each of the children private school fees at C SCHOOL, all other
incurred by the children attending school, myki card travel expenses,
private health insurance (including extras), all out-of-pocket
medical and
hospital expenses not covered by private health insurance or Medicare and all
costs incurred with dental, optical, orthodontic
treatment and other allied
health professional services for the children. The precise orders sought by her
are set out at the commencement
of these reasons. She also sought an order that
the costs not be credited against any administrative assessment of child
445 The husband opposes a departure from the current periodic assessment of
$3,057.25 per month. That figure is stated in document
5 of the wife’s
Court Book 2. In Notation B of his proposed Minute, the husband proposes that he
will continue to pay child
support as assessed and will continue to pay for the
children’s private health insurance with extras and all compulsory school
costs or agreed non-compulsory costs at C School, with such payments not to be
credited against his assessed child support.
446 The dispute between the parties is therefore whether:
(a) the periodic child should be $3,057 per
month (as currently assessed) or $4,940 per month (as sought by the wife);
(b) the husband should pay:
(i) all educational expenses
incurred by the children attending C SCHOOL, or compulsory expenses and
non-compulsory expenses as agreed;
(ii) all out of pocket medical and hospital expenses and all costs incurred with
dental, orthodontic, optical and other allied health
professional services for
the children
Section 116
Child Support (Assessment) Act
(Cth) (“the Assessment
”) sets out circumstances in which a party
may apply to the court for a departure from an administrative assessment of
support. In this case there is no dispute that there is an administrative
assessment in force.
448 Section 117 of the Assessment
provides guidance about what are
special circumstances which enable the court to be satisfied that it is
appropriate to make a departure
Section 117(4)
sets out the factors to which a court must have regard, in
determining whether it would be just and equitable to the child, the payer
payee to make a particular order under the division.
Section 117(5)
sets out the matters the court must have regard to, in
determining whether it would be otherwise proper to make a particular order
under the relevant division.
451 The Full Court in the matter of
Hides & Hatton

said as follows:
[T]he jurisdiction to make an order under
departing from an administrative assessment of child support is a discretionary
In the Marriage of
[1991] FamCA 93
(1991) 15 Fam LR 219
; (1992) FLC 92–279, it is a highly
structured discretion with the court being required to adhere to the following
strict three-step
process and to consider (at Fam LR 224; FLC 79,064):
(1) Whether one or more grounds of departure
is established.
(2) Whether it is “just and equitable” within the meaning of
to make a particular order.
(3) Whether it is “otherwise proper” within the meaning of
to make a particular order.
452 Queen’s Counsel for the wife submitted that the wife’s
expenses for the children are referred to in Part N of her
Statement of
Financial Circumstances sworn 24 March 2021. As the wife was not cross-examined
or challenged about these expenses,
then the court should accept her evidence
453 In circumstances where the husband earns well over a $1 million per
annum, and where the child support income cap is $197,393
the court should
accede to the wife’s application for a departure from periodic payments as
assessed. Similarly, the husband
had effectively been meeting some of the
non-periodic expenses which the wife sought and he should be required to
continue to do
so, as it was well within his financial capacity to do so.
454 The wife deposes in her trial affidavit to meeting considerable medical
costs incurred by the children including a paediatrician,
psychologist,
podiatrist and occupational therapist. She also deposes to paying all of the
children’s various extracurricular
expenses including but not limited to
sport and swimming. She has also paid for the children’s school uniforms
and various
school costs including purchases of computer equipment.
455 The husband, in his written submissions attempts to attack the costs
claimed by the wife in Part N of her Financial Statement,

cross-examining her about it. It is submitted that many of the expenses claimed
by her for the children are substantially
incurred by her personally, such as
utilities, hairdressing, holidays and house repairs. It is also submitted that
the wife includes
expenses which are already paid by the husband and which she
seeks to have paid, by him, in addition to child support. These include
uniforms, activities and educational costs. It is submitted that on a proper
examination of the expenses claimed by the wife, they
approximate $1,140 per
week, and if the court acceded to the wife’s application, that would mean
the wife did not pay anything
for the support of the children.
456 By way of comparison, in his Financial Statement filed 13 October 2020,
the husband deposes to paying $1,600 per week for sundry
expenses and education
costs, equivalent to $83,200 per annum together with $2,700 per month for child
support, a total of $115,600
per annum. When Child Z, the youngest child attends
C SCHOOL, the husband’s expenses for education and non-periodic child
will obviously increase. As from 1 October 2020 the amount of periodic
child support has increased to $3,057 per month.
457 I am satisfied that the grounds for departure set out
satisfied, in particular
s 117(2)(b)(ii)
s 117(2)(c)(i).
It is common ground
that the parties have always expected that the children would attend C SCHOOL
and indeed it is the husband’s
proposal that he pay all compulsory school
costs. I am also satisfied that because of the husband’s income and
earning capacity
that it is appropriate to depart from administrative
assessment.
458 I am also satisfied that it is just and equitable within the meaning of
to make an order having regard to the relevant considerations of that
section. The factors relevant to that determination include:
(a) the husband is a highly skilled medical
professional who earns a very substantial income;
(b) the husband has in the past paid the children’s educational and
medical expenses claimed by the wife in her application
for departure from
administrative assessment and has the financial capacity to continue to do
(c) although the wife has a limited income earning capacity, she should also
make a contribution towards the children’s expenses;
(d) both parties have significant property and financial resources, which should
be taken into account;
(e) the husband’s proposal is that he pay the children’s private
health insurance with extras and all compulsory educational
expenses of the
children, with non-compulsory expenses to be agreed between the parties and that
such payments not be credited against
his assessed periodic child support;
(f) there is unlikely to be any future agreement between the parents about
payment of non-compulsory expenses and it is preferable
that there is certainty
for the children in this regard;
(g) the financial commitments of both parties as set out in their respective
financial statements including direct and indirect costs
of supporting the
459 I am also satisfied that:
(a) it is otherwise proper, within the
meaning of s 117(5) of the Assessment
and in particular because, in
accordance with the objects of the Assessment
, both parents must provide for
their children; and
(b) the special circumstances of this case, namely both the husband’s
proposal to pay the majority of expenses sought by the
wife, the substantial
income of the husband and the significant property and financial resources of
both parents.
460 After considering submissions of both parties and the financial
circumstances of both parents, it is appropriate that the husband
continue to
pay periodic child support as assessed together with all of the non-periodic
education and health expenses as sought
by the wife, and that the additional
child support should not be credited against the administrative assessment of
child support.
I will make orders accordingly.
I certify that the preceding four hundred and
sixty (460) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment of
the Honourable
