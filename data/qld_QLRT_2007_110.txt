[1] This is an application under
section 245
Mineral Resources Act
for the grant of a mining lease for (a) the mining of tungsten ore,
molybdenum ore and other mineral ores, and (b) infrastructure
development and
associated activities, for a term of 20 years. The area applied for is 160ha
located about 90km west-southwest of
[2] As no tenement or environmental objections have been lodged, the application
can be dealt with under the abbreviated section
Having examined the
material provided by the mining registrar and the applicants, I am satisfied
that the relevant section 270(1)
requirements have been established.
Accordingly, the hearing is dispensed with.
[3] I have also taken into account and considered all of the matters set out in
section 269(4).
Having done so, I
recommend to the Honourable the Minister for Mines and Energy that this
application be granted in whole. However,
because the application area is
“non-exclusive land” under
section 422
, the application cannot be
granted until all relevant
provisions of the
Native Title Act 1993
have been complied
Section 270 provides:
270 Procedure where no objections lodged

the provisions requiring the hearing) have been complied with in respect of the
application;
(b) no objection to the grant of the mining lease has been duly lodged;
(c) where the application relates to land that is the surface of a reserve,
the owner thereof consents to the grant of the mining
(d) where the application is in respect of land over which, pursuant to
section 238(2)
, a mining lease shall not be granted without the consent of
another person or other persons, that person or those persons consent
(2) The tribunal shall indicate in any recommendation for the grant of a mining
lease where the hearing of the application therefor
has been dispensed with,
that the tribunal has taken into account and considered all matters in respect
thereof set out in section
Section 269(4)
269 Tribunal’s recommendation on hearing

of development and utilisation of the mineral resources
within the area applied

lease is sought is of an appropriate size and shape in
relation to—

(h) any disadvantage may result to the rights of—

(ii) existing applicants for exploration permits or mineral development
licences; and

under the authority of the proposed mining lease will conform with sound land
use management;
