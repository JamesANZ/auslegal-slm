Travers and City of Armadale, Re [2025] WAICmr 4 (30 April 2025)
Decision D0042025 – Published in note form only
Travers and City of Armadale
[2025] WAICmr
Date of Decision: 30 April 2025
Information Act 1992
Schedule 1, clause 6(1)
2021, Meghan Travers (
the complainant
applied to the City of Armadale (
) under the
Information Act 1992
the FOI Act
) for access to
documents regarding a report concerning the Roleystone Volunteer Bushfire
Brigade that had been referred to in the
agenda of a Council meeting of the
agency on 22 June 2021.
The agency identified five documents within the
scope of the access application and, by notice of decision dated 6 August 2021
initial decision
), refused the complainant access to those five
documents (
the disputed documents
) on the grounds they were exempt under
clauses 3(1) and 6(1) of Schedule 1 to the FOI Act. The agency also claimed
that a letter
of advice from the agency’s legal advisers, contained in the
disputed documents, was privileged and therefore exempt under
clause 7(1) of
Schedule 1 to the FOI Act.
The complainant sought internal review of the
agency’s decision, advising that she was ‘happy to have [the letter
removed’. As the complainant claimed internal review was not
completed within the statutory timeframe, on 20 September 2021,
the complainant
applied to the Information Commissioner (
the Commissioner
) for external
review of the agency’s decision.
Following receipt of the
complainant’s request for external review, the Commissioner obtained the
disputed documents from the
agency, together with the FOI file maintained by the
agency in respect of the access application.
The agency informed the
Commissioner that it wished to complete the internal review process.
Subsequently, the agency gave the complainant
an ‘internal review
decision’ dated 22 October 2021
internal review decision
), which essentially
confirmed the initial decision.
In an attempt to resolve this matter by
conciliation, in November 2021, one of the Commissioner’s officers
provided both the
parties with their assessment of this matter. The
officer’s assessment was that the disputed documents are not exempt under
clause 6(1) and that some information in the disputed documents was exempt under
either clause 3(1) or clause 7(1). Both parties
were invited to reconsider
their positions or to provide further submissions. Neither party accepted the
assessment, and the agency
provided further submissions in support of its claim
that the disputed documents are exempt under clause 6(1).
Both parties
provided additional information to the Commissioner’s office in January,
June and August 2022. In response to
further inquiries by the
Commissioner’s office, the agency confirmed in March 2024 that it
maintained its exemption claims
and provided further written submissions. The
agency additionally claimed that the notes from a councillor workshop in May
in Document 4 (
the workshop notes
) were exempt under clause 7(1).
On 29 November 2024, after considering the material then before her, the
Commissioner provided the parties with a letter setting out
her preliminary
view. It was the Commissioner’s preliminary view that the disputed
documents are not exempt in their entirety
under either clause 3(1) or clause
6(1); a small amount of information in the disputed documents is exempt under
clause 3(1); the
workshop notes are not exempt under clause 7(1); some
information in Document 3 is exempt under clause 7(1); and it is
practicable
for the agency to give access to an edited copy of the disputed
documents with the exempt information deleted, pursuant to section
24 of the FOI
The complainant accepted the Commissioner’s preliminary view.
Therefore, the information in the disputed documents that the
Commissioner
considered is exempt was no longer in dispute and the agency was entitled to
delete that information on that basis.
The agency also accepted the
Commissioner’s preliminary view in relation to clause 3(1). Although the
agency initially claimed
in its further submissions that additional information
in the disputed documents was exempt under clause 7(1), the agency withdrew
those claims. The agency maintained that the disputed documents were exempt
under clause 6(1) and provided further written submissions.
As a result,
the only issue remaining in dispute for the Commissioner’s determination
was whether the disputed documents are
exempt under clause 6(1).
6(1) provides that matter is exempt if its disclosure would reveal any opinion,
advice or recommendation that has been obtained,
prepared or recorded; or any
consultation or deliberation that has taken place, in the course of, or for the
purpose of, the deliberative
processes of the Government, a Minister or an
agency and, such disclosure would, on balance, be contrary to the public
Unlike the other exemption clauses in Schedule 1 to the FOI
Act that are limited by a public interest test, in the case of a claim
exemption under clause 6(1), an access applicant is not required to demonstrate
that disclosure of the requested matter would
be in the public interest.
Instead, the onus of establishing that its disclosure would, on balance, be
contrary to the public interest
rests with the agency: see
Health Department
of Western Australia v Australian Medical Association Ltd
[1999] WASCA 269
The Commissioner observed that the public interest test in
clause 6(1) is intended to cover those cases where public disclosure would
prejudicial to the proper operation of government or the proper workings of an
agency such that the right of access under the
FOI Act is subordinate:
Re BGC (Australia) Pty Ltd and Port Hedland Port Authority
The Commissioner accepted that it may be contrary to the
public interest to prematurely disclose documents while deliberations in
agency are continuing, if there is material which establishes that such
disclosure would adversely affect the agency’s decision-making
process, or
that disclosure would, for some other reason, be demonstrably contrary to the
public interest: see for example,
Re West Australian Newspapers Pty Ltd and
Western Power Corporation
[2005] WAICmr 10.
The agency acknowledged
that the deliberative process the subject of the disputed documents were at an
end. However, the agency claimed
that disclosure of the documents would
adversely affect, undermine or otherwise interfere with the agency’s
ongoing negotiations
with the Department of Fire and Emergency Services
regarding a lease agreement for an existing fire station. As the agency did not
provide any persuasive information to support those assertions, the Commissioner
did not accept the agency’s claims.
The Commissioner was not
satisfied on the information before her that the disclosure of the disputed
documents would adversely affect
any ongoing deliberations of the agency or that
any other public interest would be harmed or adversely affected by disclosure of
the disputed documents such that it would, on balance, be contrary to the public
interest to disclose them. Nor was the Commissioner
persuaded that disclosure of
the disputed documents would be prejudicial to the proper operation of
government or the proper workings
of an agency such that the right of access
under the FOI Act is subordinate.
The Commissioner considered that the
agency had not established that disclosure of the disputed documents would, on
balance, be contrary
to the public interest.
Accordingly, the
Commissioner set aside the agency’s decision. In substitution, the
Commissioner found that the disputed documents
are not exempt under clause 6(1)
of Schedule 1 to the FOI
