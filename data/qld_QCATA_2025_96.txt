APPEARANCES & REPRESENTATION:
This matter was heard and determined on the papers pursuant to
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
REASONS FOR DECISION
applicant appeals a decision made by a learned Magistrate sitting as a Tribunal
Member at Toowoomba on 16 February 2024 regarding
an application made by the
respondent for moneys owed by the applicant for two unpaid invoices, together
being a total of $5,613.93.
The first invoice concerned house cleaning type
work and the second involved fencing rectification work.
[2] The learned
Magistrate granted the respondent’s application on the basis that the
respondent abandoned its claim for fencing
work. The applicant’s
counterclaim was dismissed because she filed another claim that mirrored her
counterclaim. At first
instance, the applicant was ordered to pay the
respondent the sum of $2,670.78, being comprised of:
(a) Claim $2,310.00;
(b) Filing fees $130.70; and
(c) Interest $230.08.
[3] The claim by
the applicant, that mirrored the dismissed counterclaim, was for the amount of
$18,773.98, that being
(a) agistment costs;
(b) water consumption;
(c) barley;
(d) used hay bales;
(e) the cost of fixing damaged irrigation pipes;
(f) the cost of rectifying contaminated soil;
(g) the cost of removing the barbed wire fencing;
(h) the cost to restore a fence; and
(i) the cost to eradicate toxic fireweed.
[4] In dealing
with the applicant’s claim, the learned Magistrate determined that the
claim was not substantially within the
regard to a number of authorities, including and in particular
Hashfield v
Gold Coast City Council
[2020] QCATA 36
, and dismissed her claim on that
[5] In respect
of the amount ordered to be paid to the respondent, the learned Magistrate set
out her reasons in
I take this as an admission by Ms Shapcott that the invoice is due to be paid
and an acceptance of the amount invoiced and despite
the evidence from Ms
Shapcott in her affidavit and given orally today, Mr Grant [(the Director of the
defendant company)] has satisfied
me on the balance of probabilities that those
moneys are owing to him.
Applicable law
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2009
’). Section 25 states as follows:
The Tribunal’s appeal jurisdiction is –
(a) the jurisdiction conferred on the Tribunal by section 26; and
(b) the jurisdiction conferred on the Tribunal by an enabling Act to hear and
decide an appeal against a decision of another entity
under that Act.
[7] Section 26
of the QCAT Act states that:
The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and decide an appeal against a decision of
the Tribunal in the circumstances mentioned in section
applicant appeals pursuant to section 142 of the QCAT Act. Subsection 142(1)
states as follows:
A party to a proceeding may appeal to the Appeal Tribunal against a decision of
the Tribunal in the proceeding if a judicial member
did not constitute the
Tribunal in the proceeding.
[9] Section
142(3) states that an appeal under section 142(1) against any of the listed
decisions of the Tribunal may be made only
if the party has obtained the Appeal
Tribunal’s leave to appeal.
v Queensland Building and Construction Commission
[2023] QCATA 66
Judicial Member McGill SC summarised the approach to leave in the Appeal
As a general proposition, when leave to appeal to the Appeal Tribunal is
required, it will be granted only where there is a reasonable
argument that the
decision was attended by error and an appeal is necessary to correct a
substantial injustice caused by that error,
or where the appeal raises a
question of general importance upon which further argument and a decision of the
Appeal Tribunal would
be to the public advantage. An Appeal Tribunal would not
usually disturb findings of fact on appeal if the evidence is capable of
supporting the finding, and it is not contrary to compelling interferences. If
leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is by way
of rehearing so far as it is
against a decision on a question of fact, or of mixed fact and law: the QCAT Act
s 147. Otherwise it
is an appeal which will only correct an error of law: the
QCAT Act s 146.
principles were also referred to by Senior Member Brown and Member Traves in
Campbell v Queensland Building and Construction Commission
[2021] QCATA
The relevant principles to be applied in determining whether to grant leave to
appeal are well established: is there a reasonably
arguable case of error in the
primary decision; is there a reasonable prospect that the applicant will obtain
substantial relief;
is leave necessary to correct a substantial injustice to the
applicant caused by some error; is there a question of general importance
which further argument, and a decision of the appellate court or Tribunal, would
be to the public advantage.
enabling Act is the QCAT Act. In particular, sections 10(1)(a) and 11 of the
QCAT Act give jurisdiction to the Tribunal
to hear and decide a minor civil
dispute. Relevantly, ‘minor civil dispute’ is defined by the QCAT
Act in schedule 3
a claim to recover a debt or liquidated demand of money of up to the prescribed
[13] In the
usual course, leave to appeal will usually only be granted where it is necessary
to correct a substantial injustice to
the applicant and where there is a
reasonable argument that there was an error to be corrected. In this case,
leave to appeal is
required as the matter concerns the proceedings for a minor
civil dispute. The present appeal is on a question of mixed law and
dealing with an application for leave to appeal, the appeal must be decided by
way of rehearing. The Appeal Tribunal may
allow additional evidence. The
Appeal Tribunal may confirm or amend the decision or set aside the decision and
substitute its own
decision or set aside the decision and return the matter to
the Tribunal or other entity for reconsideration.
Submissions
applicant attached a document titled ‘Q99/22 Grounds for Leave to
Appeal’ to her application for leave to appeal
or appeal filed 18 April
[16] The first
ground is that the applicant understood that the two applications, namely Q99/22
and Q08/23, were to be heard consecutively,
whereas the learned Magistrate dealt
with them simultaneously. Having read the transcript of the reasons of the
learned Magistrate,
I am satisfied that no error has occurred because the
learned Magistrate dealt with both applications simultaneously. Indeed, it
appropriate that she do so.
[17] The second
ground was that the applicant was unable to access the Tribunal’s online
transcript portal. I am satisfied
that nothing turns on this point as
transcripts were made available.
[18] The third
ground is that the applicant did not have a full understanding of what was said
and seeks a review of relevant documents,
together with new evidence which was
unavailable at the time. For the reasons below, new evidence is not admitted in
this application and the learned Magistrate set out in clear detail
the reasons for her decision, which have been made available
to the applicant.
[19] Ground four
notes that the applicant was recovering from a stress-related medical incident
and did not have the opportunity to
verbally challenge nor refute a number of
false statements and truncated SMS images submitted by the respondent during the
of 99/22 on 16 February 2022. I am satisfied, having read the
transcript, that the learned Magistrate took into account all of the
submissions made by the parties and all of the documentary evidence that was
before her at the time.
[20] Ground five
is that the applicant categorically denies there was any agreement to pay the
respondent an unconditional labour
rate of $70 per hour; she describes this as
an allusion to a discussion on 5 April 2022, solely relating to a two-day
construction
task, which was defaulted by the respondent. Once again, the
learned Magistrate’s consideration of this evidence and reasoning
her determination are clearly set out in her reasons.
[21] Ground six
is that the applicant denies that she happily paid invoice 059 for $2,387 for
unspecified ‘
labour 31 hours
’. The learned Magistrate took
into account the applicant’s evidence in relation to those matters and the
reasons speak
for themselves.
[22] Ground
seven notes that the learned Magistrate specifically mentioned the
respondent’s defunct invoice 060, which was a
claim for $2,240 also for
unspecified ‘
labour 32 hours
’, issued 9 July 2022 and a claim
for $70 for ‘
transport of mower and sheep on 27 July 2022
This is noted and once again, reference is made to the learned
Magistrate’s reasons.
[23] Ground
eight notes that itemisation of invoice 060 had been requested but not received
until 26 August 2022 in the form of invoice
083, which the applicant refutes as
a contrived fabrication. This ground has been taken into account by the learned
Magistrate.
[24] Ground nine
is that the response statement filed by her in Q99/22 contains possible
oversights by the learned Magistrate in the
absence of new evidence (items (i),
(ii), (iii) and (iv)). Given the limited nature of the order made by the
learned Magistrate
in respect of the payment of one invoice, which the learned
Magistrate found the applicant had agreed to, the new evidence is of
assistance and leave is not granted for it to be filed.
applicant also notes that, in conclusion, the respondent also misinformed the
Court in respect of resources consumed by his
(a) The shedded hay was beardless (i.e., awn free) forage hay specifically grown
for horses, with a replacement cost of $768.
(b) There is no solar powered domestic bore, with a replacement cost of
applicant notes that the learned Magistrate made mention of:
possible consideration of off-set compensation for hay consumed by the
respondent’s cattle. However, cattle consumption off-sets
were denied;
apparently due to exclusion from QCAT’s jurisdiction (?)
Nevertheless, these were a conditional part of settlement of the
respondent’s invoices 060/083 and the exclusion of these two
alone created
a heavy financial burden for me.
respondent submits that the appeal should be dismissed. The respondent says
that the diary submitted by the applicant is
a complete lie and defames himself
and my businesses.
am satisfied that, the learned Magistrate considered all of the material before
her and gave cogent reasons for her decision,
which do not, on their face, raise
any error of law or fact.
determination by the learned Magistrate that the applicant admitted owing the
amount of the invoice ordered to be paid by
her to the respondent was a matter
for the learned Magistrate to determine. As she correctly said, it is clear
from the transcript
that the learned Magistrate made this determination on the
balance of probabilities, having regard to all of the evidence placed
her, weighing the credibility of the evidence presented to her. In those
circumstances, there is no reason to interfere with
her determination based on
her assessment of the evidence.
determination by the learned Magistrate not to deal with the applicant’s
application is, in my view, correct for the
reasons given by the learned
Magistrate that the claims were substantially outside the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal. The applicant
was made aware of this by the learned Magistrate.
Because the learned Magistrate would not deal with the claims because they were
outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction does not mean that the applicant
cannot bring an application for the moneys claimed by
her in an appropriate
Magistrate said to the
... whether you both choose to pursue your claims in another jurisdiction is a
matter for you and something you might want to get
legal advice on.
[31] Accordingly,
I am satisfied no error of law or fact was made by the learned Magistrate and
accordingly leave to appeal is refused
and the appeal is dismissed.
