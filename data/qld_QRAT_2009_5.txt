Milani v Greyhound Racing Authority [2009] QRAT 5 (15 April 2009)
RACING APPEALS
NOTICE OF DECISION
15 April 2009
Peter John Milani
RESPONDENT:
Greyhound Racing
APPEARANCES:
Mrs Julie Milani together with her husband Peter Milani for the appellant
and Mr Danny Ryan on behalf of the Greyhound Racing Authority
REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT
Mr Brockwell Miller – Deputy Chairman
Mr Dennis Standfield -
The appellant was charged with an offence under Rule 86(F)(4) of the Rules of
Greyhound Racing in that he verbally abused Mrs R Black
in the kennel area at
Cairns Greyhound Racing Club on Saturday 7 February 2009. Mrs Black was alleged
to have been the Treasurer
of the Cairns Greyhound Club at the time although in
evidence that was submitted to this Tribunal there was no proof that she was
official of the Club at the time, it appearing that she became Treasurer at
section identifies
A person (including an official) shall be guilty of an offence if
the person –
(f) Engages in, publishes or causes to be published, broadcasts or causes
to be broadcast, the use of any contemptuous, unseemly,
improper, insulting or
offensive language, conduct or behaviour in any manner or form towards, or in
relation to –
(iv) Any other person having official duties in relation to greyhound
The rule obviously is intended to ensure that persons conduct themselves
appropriately when dealing with officials, stewards, committee
controlling body members in pursuit of the Greyhound Racing Industry. There is
no doubt, from the evidence submitted,
that at the time of the alleged
allegation Mrs Black was not acting in any official capacity whether she was or
was not the Treasurer
of the Club. It is the opinion of this Tribunal that
before anyone can be charged under the rule for abuse or untoward treatment
towards a person that person who makes the complaint alleging he/she was abused
must have been acting officially. At the relevant
time Mrs Black was
acting in the capacity of a trainer of a dog in a race in which another dog
trained by Mr Milani participated.
The initial Inquiry was opened by the Chairman of Stewards Mr Peter Wilson.
He had received a letter of complaint from Mrs Black
and a corroborative letter
confirming abuse from a Mr Towers-Picton. The letter from Towers-Picton was
dated 15 February 2009.
The offence occurred on Saturday 7 February some eight
days prior. It was suggested to this Tribunal that Towers-Picton was to leave
for overseas for some indefinite time. How he came to provide the letter is
uncertain but the Inquiry on the first day was convened
on 21 February. At that
opening Inquiry day Mr Towers-Picton and Ms Accatino who was an assistant
junior kennel attendant aged approximately
17 years were the only persons
present with Mr P Wilson and other members of the committee of Inquiry. The
letter from Mrs Black
and that from Towers-Picton counter signed by
Ms Accatino was handed to the Inquiry.
At the next hearing date on 28 February Mr Milani was required to be present.
He had not been appraised of required to be present,
on the first date of the
Inquiry. It would appear that the failure to appraise him of the opening of the
Inquiry and the tendering
of letters would fly in the face of the requirement
that natural justice must be seen to have been applied and one would think
that simply on that point alone this appeal should have been upheld
however that is not, it would appear, to be the end of the matter.
During the course of the hearing Mr Wilson as Chairman identified to Mr
Milani that he had been found guilty before any charge had
been levelled against
him. The Chairman not only pre-empted the determination of the stewards he
compounded the earlier failure
to comply with the rules of natural justice which
again raises another basis for a successful appeal.
It should be noted that Mr Milani complained bitterly of the failure of the
stewards not to have warned him of the opening of the
Inquiry on 21 February and
he maintained that complaint during his appearance by video link before this
Tribunal. It seems that
from what this Tribunal can glean the evidence that was
adduced was from a certain section of the Cairns Greyhound Racing participants.
This Tribunal opined that some trainers and owners appear to be of the belief
that they should control racing without any interference
and that Mr Milani was
not welcome.
It is the opinion of this Tribunal that the charge was improperly levelled
against Mr Milani and that the conduct of the stewards
Inquiry and of the
stewards themselves was unacceptable and demanded that any determination made by
that committee of Inquiry be
set aside and this Tribunal so orders.
If the Tribunal was capable of awarding Mr Milani any legal costs, and in
this respect it should be noted that Mr Milani was not represented
by any legal
firm during the course of the Inquiry or appeal, the Tribunal would certainly do
so but as no costs have been incurred
it is not appropriate. The manner in
which the North Queensland stewards acted was simply not acceptable.
It should be noted that Mr Ryan who appeared for the stewards was extremely
concerned with the manner in which evidence had been presented
and the manner
also in which the Inquiry had been undertaken. The Tribunal congratulates Mr
Ryan for his honesty and perspicacity
in that regard and notes that it is indeed
unfortunate that he could not have had more control over persons who it would
not acting in the best interests of the Greyhound Racing
The appeal is allowed and the deposit is refunded.
