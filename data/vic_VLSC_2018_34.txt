The Respondent

and invited to provide a responding submission.
4 July 2018 the Respondent Lawyer’s submission was received.
letter dated 12 July 2018 the Respondent Lawyer was given written notice of my

Reasoning and findings on issues under investigation
(a) – Failure to reconcile trust records and prepare statements within 15
report identified that trust reconciliations for the months April 2017 to
January 2018 were not completed until 3 April 2018,
with the trust
reconciliation for the month of February 2018 being completed on 4 April
his submission dated 4 July 2018, the Respondent Lawyer agreed that he failed to
reconcile the trust account on time between April
2017 and February 2018. No
reason for this failure was provided.
the basis of the LIV investigations and conclusions, and the Respondent
Lawyer’s submission, I find it proven that the Respondent
Lawyer failed to
reconcile the law practice’s trust records either at all, or within the
required 15 working days from the
end of month between April 2017 and February
Issue (d) – Failing to keep the trust
records in accordance with the Uniform Rules
report identified that trust reconciliations for the months April 2017 to
February 2018 were not prepared in accordance with the
Uniform Rules. Therefore,
the trust records have not been properly maintained for a period of 10
his submission dated 4 July 2018, the Respondent Lawyer agreed that he failed to
reconcile the trust account on time between April
2017 and February 2018.
the basis of the LIV investigations and conclusions, and the Respondent
Lawyer’s submission, I find it proven that the Respondent
lawyer failed to
reconcile the trust records and fully maintain them in accordance with the
Uniform Rules between April 2017 and
Characterisation of conduct
complaint is about conduct that occurred from February 2017; hence the
investigation and the conduct are subject to the Uniform
I find issue (a) to be in breach of Rule 48 of the Uniform Rules.
find issue (d) to be in breach of Section 147(2)(a) of the Uniform Law.
of the Uniform Rules and Uniform Law are capable of amounting to unsatisfactory
professional conduct or professional misconduct
pursuant to sections 298(b) and
(c) of the Uniform Law respectively.
have considered previous decisions of my office and decisions of the Victorian
Civil and Administrative Tribunal (‘VCAT’).
Of the decisions
considered, conduct involving trust accounting breaches, where there is no
evidence of dishonesty, have been characterised
as both unsatisfactory
professional conduct and professional misconduct.
find that the Respondent Lawyer’s conduct is properly characterised as
unsatisfactory professional conduct rather than professional
misconduct because
of the following:
Respondent Lawyer has taken full responsibility for the trust account breaches
and took quick remedial action to fix the breaches.
have been no further trust account issues noted following the recent lodgement
of the external examiner’s report for the
law practice for the audit year
ending 31 March 2018.
trust account breaches identified were not so severe and were not for such an
extended period of time that would warrant a finding
of professional
misconduct.
Respondent Lawyer has no previous disciplinary findings in relation to his trust
Reasons for order
the basis of the analogous decisions I have considered in relation to the types
of orders imposed and the factors that were taken
into account in determining
this, I have decided to take into account the following mitigating
Respondent Lawyer has been cooperative throughout the investigation and has
agreed to this order being made.
accept the Respondent Lawyer’s submission that he has taken steps to
improve his understanding and oversight of the trust
account which has included
training for both himself and his book keeper.
consider all of the evidence and relevant law, and having made the above
findings on the issues under investigation, I determine
that it is fair and
reasonable in all the circumstances to make the orders detailed
Other issues under investigation
(b) – Caused a deficiency in the trust ledger without reasonable
report found that the practitioner caused the trust ledger of “AV &
MV” to be deficient in the amount of $1,240.70
following a payment to the
Casey City Council (‘the Council’) on 2 February 2017. The
deficiency was only discovered
by the LIV at the time of the investigation on 5
April 2018, and the funds were then immediately restored by the law practice.
the trust ledger had remained deficient for a period of 14 months.
his submission dated 4 July 2018, the Respondent Lawyer admits that there was a
deficiency, and says that it was caused by an error.
The client concerned had 2
ledgers for related matters and the payment to the Council had been withdrawn
from the incorrect ledger
which had sufficient funds for the disbursement paid
to the Council. It was also noted that unfortunately the deficiency was not
picked up by either his book keeper or his external auditor on 9 June 2017.
I accept that there was an administrative error, and that the client otherwise
had sufficient funds in trust, this does not
of itself excuse the causing of a
deficiency which could have been prevented (or detected earlier) had greater
care been taken. In
the circumstances however I am not satisfied that the breach
amounts to unsatisfactory professional conduct and so close this part
complaint pursuant to section 277(1)(h) of the Uniform Law.
Issue (c) – Failed to give written notice of trust irregularity
to regulator
LIV investigation and report identified a trust deficiency which the Respondent
Lawyer was advised of on the same day. The designated
regulatory authority is
the Legal Services Board (‘the Board’). The Respondent Lawyer did
not give written notice to
the Board of the trust account irregularity as
required in accordance with section 154(1)(a) of the Uniform Law.
Respondent Lawyer’s obligation to notify the Board arose on the day of the
investigation upon becoming aware of the deficiency.
his submission dated 4 July 2018, the Respondent Lawyer says that there was no
intention to conceal the deficiency. Instead he
understood from his discussions
with the investigator that it would be reported to the Board by the investigator
and he then signed
the investigation report the same day.
accept that the Respondent Lawyer was unaware of the deficiency until the
conversation with the LIV investigator, and that the Board
would be notified of
the trust account irregularity by the LIV, which did occur. Again, had greater
care been taken the whole situation
could have been avoided. However in the
circumstances, I close this part of the complaint pursuant to section 277(1)(h)
of the Uniform
to Section 314 of the Uniform Law, a respondent lawyer or a legal practitioner
associate of a respondent law practice may,
in accordance with the applicable
legislation appeal to the VCAT, or seek a review by the VCAT, of this
determination made under
section 299 of the Uniform
