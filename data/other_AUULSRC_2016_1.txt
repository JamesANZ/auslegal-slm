Costs Estimates [2016] AUULSRC 1 (11 March 2016)
COMMISSIONER FOR UNIFORM LEGAL SERVICES REGULATION
GUIDELINE AND DIRECTION
- COSTS ESTIMATES
Guideline and Direction seeks to promote consistency in the exercise of their
functions by local regulatory authorities in relation
to dispute resolution and
professional discipline matters concerning legal costs under the Legal
Profession Uniform Law (LPUL).
also seeks to advance the objective stated by section 169 (a) of the LPUL to
ensure that clients are able to make informed choices
and the costs associated with pursuing those options.
these purposes, I express my view as Commissioner for Uniform Legal Services
Regulation (CULSR) that an estimate of the total
legal costs in a matter, as
required by section 174 (1) (a) of the LPUL, is a reasonable approximation of
the total costs that a
client is likely to have to pay in the matter for which
instructions have been given, expressed as a single figure, from time to
(the estimate). The definition of total legal costs in this context includes
professional fees, any disbursements and GST, which
should be separately
identified, but not interest: LPUL section 6. It should be noted that where a
costs agreement includes an uplift
fee, that fee should be included as part of
the estimate of total legal costs, with the circumstances in which it would be
explained to the client.
should be noted that section 174 (1) (a) also requires a law practice to
disclose the basis on which legal costs will be calculated.
is at all times important that the matter for which the estimate is required is
clearly defined and understood by both the law
practice and their client and, in
particular, it should be explained to a client that the estimate is not a fixed
fee quotation.
requirement to give an estimate does not preclude a fixed fee quotation being
given if it is desired by the law practice so to
a law practice is required pursuant to section 174 (1) (b) to provide
information about any significant change to anything previously
disclosed, a
revision of the estimate may also be required. Any revised estimate should also
be provided to the client in accordance
with that section.
provision of an estimate or estimates from time to time does not preclude the
provision of other information to a client about
the steps or stages in a matter
and the provision of such information to a client should be encouraged. It will
not be inconsistent
with section 174 (1) (a) to provide costs estimates for each
of the stages that the matter might reach, whether individual stage
are expressed as a single figure or as a range of figures, PROVIDED the law
practice, having considered all the circumstances
and the most likely outcome,
always gives the single figure estimate of the total legal costs in the matter
that section 174 (1)
(a) requires. It is permissible and may be desirable to
preface a single figure estimate with the word ‘about’ to reflect
the fact that the figure is an estimate and is not a fixed
Having regard to my opinion that
the following direction is necessary and appropriate to ensure that the
designated local regulatory
authorities to which it is addressed act in a manner
that promotes inter-jurisdictional consistency in the application of the Legal
Profession Uniform Law and of the Uniform Rules:
I HEREBY GIVE A
DIRECTION TO:
➢ The Council of the Law Society of NSW;
➢ The Council of the NSW Bar Association;
➢ The NSW Legal Services Commissioner;
➢ The Victorian Legal Services Board; and
➢ The Victorian Legal Services Commissioner
(i) to keep me as the Commissioner for Uniform Legal Services Regulation
informed at intervals to be advised of the extent to which
the ordinary exercise of their functions and in their respective opinions the
views expressed in Guideline CULSR 01/2016 –
Costs Estimates are applied
in practice; and of any judicial or other decisions that may come to their
attention concerning the interpretation
of the requirements of section 174 (1)
(a) and (b) to provide an estimate; and
(ii) to report pursuant to section 440 at least annually and as required on:
the extent to
which the total estimated legal costs in matters are based on the appropriate
exercise of the professional judgment
of law practices generally or in
particular matters or classes of matters;
the extent to
which law practices adequately disclose and explain the possible variables that
may impact on total legal costs to their
the extent to
which the disclosed estimated total legal costs depart from final bills;
what are fair
and reasonable legal costs in particular circumstances, having regard to the
principles and criteria set out in section
the operation of
any rule made under section 178 (3); and
matters required or permitted by the Uniform Law and notified to local
regulatory authorities in relation to legal
