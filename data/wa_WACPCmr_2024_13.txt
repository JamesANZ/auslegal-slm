Reasons for Decision
As a delegate of

request form dated 25 September 2024, the tenant states that the pet will be
always kept outside.
The landlords submit that it would be
‘inhumane’ to keep the requested pet outside without a shelter or
kennel. Both parties
provided Consumer Protection with photos of the premises.
The photos indicate that the outdoor area is fully fenced with a grassed
garden beds, and a sheltered and paved patio area. The patio will provide both
shelter and shade from the weather.
The RTA provides examples of why a

regard to these examples,
I am satisfied that there is secure fencing and open
space for the requested pet.
There is no other evidence which suggests
that the premises are unsuitable for keeping the requested pet.

the pet at the premises likely to cause damage that would cost more than the
security bond to repair?
A security bond of $2,800 is held with Bonds
Administration for this premises.
In written submissions to Consumer
Protection, the landlords raised the following concerns:
agreed to rent out the premises on the condition that pets are not allowed, and
the tenant is now being “dishonest”
by requesting a pet.
The requested
pet and an additional dog have been kept at the premises in breach of agreement.
The landlords supplied photos showing

the bond money”.
From 29 July 2024, changes to the RTA
came into effect giving tenants the right to request permission to keep a pet at
their rental
premises. As part of these changes, tenants are entitled to request
to keep a pet, even if their residential tenancy agreement includes
prohibiting pets - such a term would now be void for inconsistency with the
I acknowledge that the landlords believe that the requested pet and
another dog have been kept at the property for an unknown period.
This is not
relevant to the question of whether the requested pet is likely to cause damage,
and whether that damage is likely to
cost more than the bond to repair.
In written submissions to Consumer Protection, the tenant states that
the requested pet is well trained.
No evidence has been provided to
demonstrate that the requested pet is likely to cause damage that would cost
more than $2,800 to
repair. The tenant’s income is not a relevant
consideration for this ground.
Having regard to the evidence presented
by both parties, I am not satisfied that the requested pet is likely to cause
damage that
would cost more than the security bond to repair.
