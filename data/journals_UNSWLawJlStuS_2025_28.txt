While many species are on the brink of extinction, scientific advancements
are paving the way for a future in which certain species,
may, conversely, be on
the verge of reappearance.

populations, conservationists envision that the natural environment and
ecosystem functions could be restored

The ultimate aim, as argued by de-extinction scientists, should be the
‘establishment of viable free-ranging populations’.

The legal status of de-extinct species is inherently tied to the scientific
methods used to bring them back, with different techniques

on the method used, the species’

involves obtaining an egg from a closely related species, removing its DNA, and
replacing it with the DNA of the extinct

depends on the availability of complete and viable nuclear DNA of the extinct

of a closely related living species that may
serve as the egg donor.

Cloning presents the greatest ambiguity in determining the legal
classification of the resultant organism. The precise replication
of the extinct

‘wildlife’ and afforded protection

C Artificial Selection

artificial selection is ‘back-breeding,’ in which direct descendants
of recently extinct species are bred ‘back’
to an edition of the
extinct species.
As the breeding process is natural, the resulting organism would not qualify
as an ‘invention’ or a GMO, thereby excluding
these classifications.
While the natural process allows the organism to be classified as
‘wildlife,’ ambiguities emerge
regarding how a modified version of
an existing species or a new species altogether would be accommodated by
existing conservation
III CLASSIFICATIONS
The legal categorisation of de-extinct animals is contingent upon the
scientific methodology employed in their resurrection. Possible
classifications
include ‘wildlife,’ governed by environmental legislation,
‘GMOs,’ subject to gene technology
regulations, and
‘patentable inventions’ capable of commodification. This section
will critically examine how these methodologies
inform legal classifications and
assess the implications of each regulatory framework on the ecological
objectives underpinning de-extinction
In light of the ecological imperatives driving de-extinction and the
restoration of natural ecosystems, categorising a resurrected
‘wildlife’ emerges as the most advantageous approach. Such a
classification would subject the species to the
robust protective framework of
biodiversity and conservation laws, offering critical safeguards such as habitat
preservation, regulatory
oversight to prevent exploitation and allow potential
access to conservation funding.
This legal status would facilitate ‘rewilding’ or the reintegration
of species into their native ecosystems by promoting
responsible management and
safeguarding against environmental harm. Through the example of the thylacine,

the challenges inherent in integrating de-extinct
species within existing biodiversity and conservation frameworks.

regulates GMOs.
Framing de-extinct species through the lens of methodology allows us to
consider the diverse categorisations that may be available
to the same species.
As discussed above, thylacines resurrected through genetic engineering or
artificial selection would fall outside
conservation laws. However, genetic
editing of the thylacine genome would place the resultant species within the
legal definition
of ‘genetically modified organism’ as it is an
organism that has been ‘modified by gene technology’ or otherwise
‘inherited particular traits from an organism because of a gene

Consequently, a genetically edited thylacine would be subject to the
provisions of the

regulations.

seeks to regulate GMOs through mechanisms such as licensing
and works in conjunction with state legislation, which may impose additional
restrictions on GMOs. For example, in 2001, Tasmania introduced a moratorium on

which was extended in 2019
for a further 10 years.
and controlled release is permitted for research and development
but would not extend to
permit the full integration of de-extinct species into the environment. The
envisioned free-ranging role
of de-extinct animals in eco-system reintegration
would thus be limited, whether by being subject to license conditions or by the
total prohibition of release in some states.
C Patentable Invention
Genetic engineering and cloning may allow for de-extinct animals to be
patented. This development poses significant challenges to
the ecological
objectives of such efforts, as patentability introduces the potential for
corporate investment, monopolisation, and
exploitation, facilitating the
commercialisation of restored species through private zoos or parks for

have implications for ‘rewilding’, generating a potentially
irreconcilable chasm between initial

or whether such

IV REFLECTIONS ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN LAW AND
While science and law are often seen as opposing, or mutually exclusive
entities, the analysis of de-extinction categorisation above
has illuminated
that these fields collaborate and influence one another. It is strikingly
evident that scientific knowledge and legal
frameworks evolve alongside and
guide one another, in that the method influences categorisation which in turn
influences ecological
conservation.
De-extinction via
cloning may allow species to be classified as ‘wildlife’ or an
‘invention’, while genetic
engineering is likely to lead to GMO
regulations applying. Artificial selection will allow for categorisation as
‘wildlife,’
but its hybrid nature is likely to leave it outside
certain protections afforded to native species such as the status of an
‘endangered’
or ‘vulnerable’ species. The effect of
categorisations such as ‘GMO’ or ‘invention’ as opposed
to ‘wildlife’ undermine the underlying ecological purpose of
de-extinction projects, which would be best served by protections
afforded by
ecologically focused legal frameworks such as the
. Science and
law mutually influence each other, with scientific processes directly affecting
legal categorisation, which in turn
produces outcomes that affect the scientific
goal of establishing 'viable free-ranging
populations’.
This tension may arise from the understanding that science generates
objective, value-neutral ‘facts of nature’ that reflect
an impartial
representation of reality.
Science gives us the ‘fact’ that gene editing, for example, produces
a species that differs from the original or ‘target’
species. This
objective representation alters our legal ability to categorise the animal as
‘native,’ pushing it outside
of the protection of the
. Scientific facts and evidence ‘depoliticise’ nature by
narrowing the margin for values, ideologies, or beliefs to be
imbued upon the
physical world.
The issue with
this lies in the fact that scientific facts are intrinsically value-neutral and
do not account for subjective desires
or objectives, in this case, the goal of
ecological restoration. This results in legal classifications that are
incongruent or divergent
from the underlying purposes of de-extinction
initiatives. Species are ‘genetically modified organisms’ or
‘inventions’
susceptible to strict regulations or commodification,
running askew from envisioned ‘rewilding’ efforts rooted in
environmental
concerns or
So, while science offers
the mechanics to fulfil or address environmental values, this perception that
science creates ‘objective
facts’ simultaneously obscures the
application of these scientific tools by overlooking and misaligning with
underlying purposes.
This tension is resolved in recognising that science
necessarily operates within and is shaped by normative, value-laden
institutions.
Scientific knowledge and methods do not exist in isolation;
rather, they are embedded in and influenced by contemporary political,
and economic discourses. A contrasting yet informative example of this dynamic
is also evident in the field of modern medicine.
Although the discovery and
research underpinning pharmaceutical products rely on objective scientific
disciplines such as chemistry,
biology, and physics, the decisions about which
drugs are developed and brought to market are not purely scientific. Instead,
choices are guided by broader structural forces, especially economic and
geopolitical considerations. As a result, pharmaceutical
research is often
disproportionately directed toward treating illnesses prevalent in the Western
nations, where financial incentives
Thus, while science
may generate ‘objective facts’, it is never fully divorced from the
value-laden landscapes in which
it is applied. The claim of value-neutrality in
science masks its entanglement with normative institutions and its capacity to
the very goals, whether ecological or ethical, it is mobilised to
serve. Evidently, the ecological imperatives of de-extinction have
undermined by broader societal concerns.
Further, current legal frameworks are underdeveloped in their capacity to
reconcile objective facts with scientific objectives due

Without such reform, conservationists and
scientists may find themselves in
legal limbo, unable to release or protect these animals due to a lack of legal
recognition. The
formal recognition of ‘functional proxies’ would
not only confer legitimacy on emerging conservation practices involving
de-extinction and ecological substitution but would also facilitate the
alignment of environmental law with contemporary scientific
understandings of
species function, ecosystem dynamics, and biodiversity resilience.
Evidently, the existing legal framework is ill-equipped to address the
ecological restorative objectives that underpin de-extinction
projects, as
classification is driven by scientific methodologies that produce
‘objective facts’ that are devoid of important
value propositions.
Advancements in biotechnology create an extra puzzle piece that must be wedged
into the existing puzzle, compelling
an incongruent and forced integration. This
placement currently leaves no space for underlying ecological directives to
and de-extinction projects are rendered useless for ecological
restoration.
V CONCLUSION
De-extinction is emerging as a viable scientific possibility, presenting
opportunities to reverse negative environmental trends such

However, with novel
scientific developments comes a complex set of legal considerations that should
be addressed sooner rather than
later. This essay has explored the interaction
between science and the law, looking at how de-extinction methodology influences
categorisation, which in turn impacts ecological restoration. Depending on
whether cloning, genetic engineering or artificial selection
is the primary
process, the resultant species will be considered either wildlife, a GMO or a
patentable invention. For instance,
a thylacine created via cloning would be
subject to different regulatory frameworks than one produced via genetic
engineering or
artificial selection, despite sharing the same underlying purpose
of ecological restoration. In this way, it is evident that science
and law limit
each other. The law limits, confines or constrains nature by necessitating that
it fit within existing legal categorisations;
and nature marks the limits of the
power and reach of the law to place de-extinct species within protective
frameworks.
Alternatively, it
could be argued that the law lags behind scientific progress, constrained by its
inability to adapt swiftly enough.
My analysis tells us that current legal
frameworks in Australia are limited in their capacity to support ecologically
driven de-extinction
projects and must evolve to establish new legal categories
to address emerging challenges.
