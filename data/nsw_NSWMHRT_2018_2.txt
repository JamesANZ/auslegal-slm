sections 46
Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act
, the Tribunal orders that Mr Nichols be transferred to and detained in

Dated 21 June 2018
1. Mr Nichols is currently detained in Y Correctional
Centre on an order of the Mental Health Review Tribunal dated 2 June 2015. Mr
Nichols’ treating team is seeking no change at this review. The Tribunal
on its motion made a time limited order at this
2. [Mr Nichols is both a forensic patient and serving a sentence of
imprisonment.]
TRIBUNAL REQUIREMENTS
3. This is a review pursuant to
section 46(1)
Mental Health
(Forensic Provisions) Act 1990
(“the Act”). Under
Tribunal is required to review the case of each forensic patient every six
months. On such a review the Tribunal may make orders
as to the patient’s
continued detention, care or treatment or the patient’s release.
4. The Act has special evidentiary requirements in relation to leave or
release which must be satisfied before the Tribunal can grant
leave or release.
In view of this, the Tribunal requires notice of applications for leave or
release to ensure that the necessary
evidence is available. This process also
enables the Tribunal to provide notice of such applications to the Minister for
the Attorney General, and any registered victims who are entitled to
make submissions concerning any proposed leave or release. A
notice was provided
to the Tribunal prior to this review for an application for no change.
5. Without limiting any other matters the Tribunal may consider, the Tribunal
must consider the principles set out in section 40 of
the Act and
Mental Health Act 2007
as well as the following matters under
when determining what order to make:
(a) whether the person is suffering from a mental illness or other mental
(b) whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that care,
treatment or control of the person is necessary for the person’s
protection from serious harm or the protection of others from serious harm,
(c) the continuing condition of the person, including any likely
deterioration in the person’s condition, and the likely effects
such deterioration,
DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
6. The Tribunal considered the documents listed in the Forensic Patient
Exhibit List.
7. Mr Nichols attended the hearing by videolink and was represented by his
lawyer, Ms Agnes Dalumpines of the Mental Health Advocacy
Also in attendance was a Registered Nurse from Y Correctional Centre.
PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES
8. Mr Nichols has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, paranoid type. He is
currently prescribed Quetiapine. His present mental state
is noted in his
clinical progress notes of [date] last by Dr A, Psychiatrist as being in
9. Dr A was not available to give evidence before the Tribunal and, apart
from his entries in Mr Nichols’ medical records, did
not provide a written
report to the Tribunal. Reference to Mr Nichols’ clinical progress notes
confirmed he had seen Mr Nichols
twice since the last Tribunal review in
December 2017.
10. The Registered Nurse gave oral evidence to the Tribunal that Mr Nichols
was managing well in his present environment. She stated
she had formally seen
Mr Nichols once in the past six months but she occasionally encountered him when
he came for his medication.
11. Before the Tribunal Mr Nichols spoke in a rather animated fashion,
described by Dr A as ‘driven’ in delivery. He talked
he does at Y Correctional Centre and that it keeps him busy and any ‘bad
thoughts’ at bay.
12. A report from the Serious Offenders Review Council (SORC) last noted,
inter alia, that Mr Nichols was ‘travelling well at
[Y] CC’ with no
adverse reports. He is eligible to be considered for progression to medium
security on [date].
13. The request from Mr Nichols’s ‘treating team’ was that
he should remain at Y CC. Ms Dalumpines confirmed her
instructions from Mr
Nichols were also to that effect and Mr Nichols himself stated his wish to
remain where he was as he had an
established job and routine that suited
14. It is a matter of record that Mr Nichols is both a forensic patient and a
sentenced inmate. It is also a matter of record that
Mr Nichols has been
assessed as requiring a transfer to the X Hospital to enable him to receive the
therapeutic treatment and access
to programs that are only available at the X
Hospital. Mr Nichols’s work at Y does keep him occupied, however the
that Mr Nichols’s underlying mental illness requires he be
treated, not just managed.
15. It has also been a matter of some debate as to whether Mr Nichols may be
transferred to the X Hospital because of his concurrent
status as a sentenced
inmate. The Tribunal does not propose to canvass earlier submissions received on
this issue at this time except
to say it is satisfied Mr Nichols is eligible to
be admitted to the X Hospital because he is a forensic patient. That he is also
a sentenced inmate does not preclude his admission. While not exactly on this
point, the Tribunal notes an earlier decision of the
Tribunal (in
[2017] NSWMHRT 8)
confirmed the Tribunal’s power pursuant to
section 58(3)
Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990
Act) to transfer a patient detained in a correctional centre to a specified
mental health facility within a particular time
of the Act provides that any period of time Mr Nichols
serves in a mental health facility would count as full-time detention for
purposes of sentence and parole considerations. Further, as has been pointed out
earlier by the Tribunal, there ‘does not
appear to be anything in the Act
Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999
to suggest that
the imposition of a sentence or imprisonment deprives the Tribunal of its power
sections 46
to decide a forensic patient’s place of
detention’.
17. In June 2016 SORC reportedly advised it would be appropriate for
discussions to occur between Corrective Services, Justice Health
and Forensic
Mental Health to determine protocols for these cases. There was no evidence
before the Tribunal to confirm whether such
discussions had occurred and what
progress, if any, had been made.
18. The Tribunal expressed concern that no progress appears to have been made
to facilitate Mr Nichols’s transfer to the X Hospital.
On any view,
the circumstances of his index offence as well as his diagnosed mental illness
require a thorough assessment and treatment
that only the X Hospital can
provide. As it was explained to Mr Nichols, while he may feel safe and
comfortable at Y CC, he will
not make the necessary progress he needs to make as
a forensic patient until such time as he receives the appropriate care and
that his mental illness requires. On any reasonable view, that will
take a considerable period of time.
DETERMINATION
19. The Tribunal determined it was appropriate at this time to make the
appropriate order to facilitate Mr Nichols’s transfer
to the X Hospital
for care and treatment. In doing so the Tribunal acknowledged that certain
protocols may be required as flagged
by SORC in 2016. Accordingly, the Tribunal
determined Mr Nichols was to be transferred to the X Hospital within 12 months
from today’s
date and in the meantime he is to remain in a correctional
centre to receive care and treatment.
20. Mr Nichols will be further reviewed in six months.
