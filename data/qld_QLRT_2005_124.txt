COUNSEL: Paul Smith for the Respondent
SOLICITOR/S: Mr G.F. Jongkind, Frank Jongkind & Co, Charleville for
Ms J Humphris of McDonnells, Brisbane, for Respondent.
[1] On 25 July 2005, Mining Referee Windridge determined compensation of
$4,609.00 is payable by Xalco Pty Ltd (the Applicant) to
Colonial Agricultural
Company Ltd (the Respondent) in relation to grant of mining lease 60360. Mr
Windridge ordered the Applicant
to pay that sum within 3 months of notification
of the grant of the mining lease. He also ordered the Applicant to pay the
Respondent’s
costs in the sum of $2,800. The Applicant wishes to appeal
against both the determination of compensation and the costs order.
August 2005, the Applicant filed an application for an extension of time to
appeal against both and for related orders.
[2] The Tribunal (appeal) was constituted by President Koppenol and Deputy
President Kingham. The Applicant filed an affidavit by
its sole director, Mr
Christante. The Respondent filed no evidence. A statement by Mr Cameron, a
case officer employed by the Tribunal,
was filed and served on both parties.
Written submissions were made by both parties in writing and, at their request,
the application
was heard on the papers.
extend time to appeal – appeal against determination
[3] The first order sought by the Applicant is to extend the time limited for
the institution of an appeal against the decision of
the Tribunal on 25 July
2005 to allow the Registrar to determine security for costs pursuant to
Mineral Resources Act 1989
(MRA). That application is
made pursuant to
of the MRA. That section provides for an appeal
against a determination of
compensation made by the Tribunal under
MRA. The determination of compensation does not include the order as to costs,
which was made under s. 50 of the
Land and Resources Tribunal Act 1999
[4] Section 282(1) provides that a party aggrieved by a determination of the
tribunal made under section 282 may
“within 20 business days of that
determination or within such further period as the tribunal (appeal), on the
application of
that party in that behalf prior to the lodgement of the appeal,
considers appropriate in any particular circumstances, appeal against
determination to the tribunal (appeal).”
The period for appealing
against the compensation determination expired on 23 August 2005. The
application to extend time was made
on 22 August 2005. The appeal was not
lodged, although a proposed notice of appeal was attached to the application.
The preconditions
to the Tribunal (appeal) exercising its jurisdiction have been
Power to extend time to appeal – appeal
against order as to costs
[5] The second order sought by the Applicant is to extend the time limited for
the institution of an appeal against the order for
costs made pursuant to s. 50
of the LRT Act. An appeal against that order is governed by s. 67 of the LRT
Act. That appeal must
be made within 28 days after the decision was given.
That period expired on 22 August 2005. There is no provision in the LRT Act
extending time. The Applicant relied on rule 7 of the
Uniform Civil
Procedure Rules
(UCPR). That relates only to time limits set by those
rules. In the absence of a specific statutory provision, there is no general
power to enlarge time. Accordingly, order 2 is refused. Orders 3 & 4 are
predicated on the assumption that appeals against both
the determination and the
costs order will be instituted. Accordingly the requests for those orders are
also declined.
Factors to consider on application for
extension of time to appeal
[6] The Tribunal (appeal) has the power to set such further period as it
considers appropriate in any particular circumstances”
MRA does not contain any criteria by reference to which this discretion is to be
exercised. In
Struber & Anor v Fitzgerald
[2005] QLRT 104
Tribunal (appeal) indicated that there were two main issues to be considered:
whether the applicant can explain the delay that
has occurred and any potential
injustice or prejudice that might be suffered if the application is refused.
Other relevant factors
whether the rules will work an injustice,
having regard to the history of the proceedings, the conduct of the parties, the
of the litigation, and the consequences for the parties of the grant or
refusal of the application for an extension of
the prospects of the applicant succeeding
in the appeal;
potential prejudice to the Respondent of granting the
application.
[7] The Tribunal (appeal) respectfully adopts the observations of the Full
Federal Court that
“..leave to appeal out of time is to be determined
by the court’s view of the demands of justice in accordance with a
judicial discretion, and not simply upon the application of any verbal
requires a consideration of all the relevant facts of a particular
Considerations of those factors in relation to
this application:
The Applicant has adequately explained the need
for an extension of time
[8] The Applicant submitted there was no relevant delay to explain, because Mr
Christante enquired about filing a notice of appeal
within the appeal period.
We do not accept that submission. Section 282(3) requires a number of steps to
be taken before the appeal
period expires. It is common ground that none of
them have been taken, although the Applicant was clearly in a position to lodge
the notice of appeal within the appeal period.
[9] The Applicant filed an affidavit by its sole director, Mr Christante,
relating his recollection of a conversation with Mr Cameron,
a case officer
employed by the Tribunal. Mr Cameron subsequently filed a statement about that
conversation. There are some differences
between the two accounts of the
conversation. Importantly, Mr Cameron disputed the suggestion made by Mr
Christante that he either
advised Mr Christante on the procedure he should adopt
or told him that the notice of appeal would not be accepted because security
costs had to be approved by the Registrar at the time the appeal was filed. Mr
Cameron says that he referred Mr Christante to
relevant sections of the MRA and
to a recent decision of the Tribunal that might provide assistance and
recommended that Mr Christante
seek legal advice. It is common ground between
the two that there was a discussion about at least some of the options that
be open to the Applicant.
[10] In submissions filed after Mr Cameron’s statement was filed, the
Applicant agreed that Mr Cameron said he could not give
legal advice and had
recommended Mr Christante obtain legal advice about his options. The Respondent
submitted the application should
be decided on the basis of Mr Cameron’s
version of the conversation. Ultimately, we do not consider anything material
on the differences between the two deponents. Both parties requested that
the application was dealt with on the papers and neither
sought the opportunity
to cross-examine either of the deponents.
[11] The difficulty for the Applicant arose because of two peculiar features of
s. 282. Firstly, there is the requirement for the
Applicant to give and the
Registrar to approve security for costs as a step in the institution of the
appeal. This contrasts with
the usual civil procedure where an appeal is
instituted by filing a notice of
and, if the Respondent seeks
security for costs, it has to make an application for such an
Secondly, pursuant to
s.282(1), if an extension of time is required to institute the appeal, the
application for an extension must
be made before the appeal is lodged. Once
again this contrasts with the usual civil procedure which does not preclude
application
after the appeal is lodged and can be made at any
[12] Once the Applicant became aware of these requirements it faced a dilemma:
should it file the notice of appeal and seek approval
of the Registrar for
security for costs with only 2 business days before the appeal period expired or
should it seek an extension
of time within which to do this. Mr Christante
decided the applicant should take the course of applying for an extension of
before it lodged the notice of appeal, and instructed the
Applicant’s lawyer accordingly.
[13] The Respondent submitted that Mr Christante should not have formed a
conclusion about the steps he should take without legal
“notwithstanding that this requirement was made clear to him by Mr
. Mr Cameron’s statement makes it clear that he
recommended Mr Christante obtain legal advice. He did not state it as a
requirement,
nor could he have done so. Parties are entitled to appear before
the Tribunal with or without legal or other
representation.
[14] Further, Mr Christante had already made contact with the Applicant’s
lawyer. On 11 August 2005, well before the appeal
period expired, he instructed
the lawyer to prepare a notice of appeal. The notice of appeal was drafted by
18 August 2005. Whilst
the Applicant’s lawyer provided advice to the
Applicant about the appeal period, there is no evidence to suggest he provided
advice about the other requirements to validly institute the appeal. Had he
done so, an extension of time may not have been necessary.
The failure to do
so, in itself, can be regarded as a sufficient reason to allow the
[15] It appears that, until Mr Christante made contact with Mr Cameron, he was
not aware of the requirement to give security for
costs and to obtain the
Registrar’s approval for such security. Mr Christante was entitled to
form his own conclusions about
how to respond and the course he chose to adopt,
with or without legal advice, was open to him and was clearly designed to
his appeal rights while the question of security for costs could be
settled with the Registrar.
[16] The Respondent submitted that the Applicant made no attempt to negotiate
security for costs with the Respondent during the appeal
period. It is
reasonable to assume the Applicant’s prospects of obtaining the
Registrar’s approval would be enhanced
if it had the agreement of the
Respondent to the amount and form of security proffered. However, there is no
statutory requirement
for the Applicant or, indeed, the Registrar to consult the
Respondent about the amount or form for security for costs, let alone
There is no prejudice to the respondent if the
application is granted
[17] The Respondent has not suggested that it will be prejudiced in anyway if
the application is granted. It is worth noting that
compensation was not
payable immediately, rather within 3 months after notice of the grant of the
mining lease. In the absence of
any evidence on this point, it is assumed that
the grant has not yet been made.
If the application is
refused, the applicant will lose its right to appeal
[18] If the application is refused, the Applicant loses a significant appeal
right. An appeal under s. 282 is an appeal as of right.
The Tribunal (appeal)
must consider the matters that the Tribunal at first instance was required to
consider when it made its determination.
It can vary the determination as it
thinks just or confirm the determination.
The proposed
notice of appeal raises proper grounds
[19] The proposed notice of appeal raises a number of grounds of appeal in
relation to the weight given to certain evidence tendered
at the hearing and,
consequently, the amounts determined by the Tribunal as compensation for
deprivation of possession of the surface
area of the land, the value of lost
production and diminution in the value of the land. These are all matters both
the Tribunal
at first instance and the Tribunal (appeal) are required to
The Respondent has
not suggested the appeal is mala fides or is made on slight or foolish grounds.
Extended appeal period
[20] The Applicant has not indicated the date to which it asks the appeal period
be extended, referring, instead, to the Registrar
“determining”
security for costs pursuant to s. 282(2)(c). The function of the Registrar is
to approve security that
is given by the Applicant. It is incumbent upon the
Applicant, therefore, to proffer security in an amount it considers to be
in the circumstances of the case, for the Registrar’s approval.
Whilst the notice of appeal has already been drafted, all the
steps required to
be taken pursuant to s. 282(2) are still outstanding. Time is required for these
to be completed as well as for
the Registrar to approve security for costs. We
note that Mr Christante is based in Granville, New South Wales and the
Applicant’s
lawyer is based in Charleville, Queensland. In the
circumstances of this case, we consider it is reasonable to allow the Applicant
until 4pm on Friday 14 October to institute the
[21] The Respondent has asked for the opportunity to make submissions about
costs once the decision on the application has been made.
In the circumstances,
we consider it more appropriate to reserve the costs of this application to the
hearing of the appeal. If
the appeal is not instituted in accordance with these
orders, the Respondent has leave to seek an order for costs in this
application.
Directions for the conduct of the
[22] Unless the parties file consent directions within 14 days of the appeal
being instituted, the Registrar is directed to list
the appeal for a directions
[23] The applicant has until 4pm on Friday 14 October 2005 to institute the
appeal against the determination of compensation made
on 25 July 2005 in
relation to mining lease 60360.
[24] The application for an extension of time to appeal against the costs order
of the Tribunal made on 25 July 2005 is refused.
[25] The costs of this application are reserved to be determined at the hearing
of the appeal. If the appeal is not instituted in
accordance with these orders,
the Respondent has leave to seek an order for costs in this
application.
[26] Unless the parties file consent directions within 14 days of the appeal
being instituted, the Registrar is directed to list
