REASONS FOR DETERMINATION
Introduction
1. On 17 June 2021 the worker’
referral was
determined by the Tribunal in favour of the worker.
2. The worker now applies
for an order as to costs in his favour. The employer does not consent to an
order that the employer pay
the worker’s costs but makes no submissions
against such an order being made in favour of the worker.
3. As stated by
Commissioner Chandler in G. v Toll Holdings Limited
[2015] TASWRCT 38
empowers the Tribunal to make such order as to costs as it considers
appropriate. Ordinarily the proper course is for an order that
follow the event’ and are thus awarded to the successful party. See State
of Tasmania v Farrow
[1997] TASSC 62
7 Tas R 127.
However, this course may be
departed from if it is shown that the successful party’s conduct was
unreasonable or improper
and/or that he or she did something connected with the
institution or the conduct of the proceedings which was calculated to occasion
unnecessary litigation and expense. See Unilever Australia Limited v Gunn &
P D Wholesalers Pty Ltd 143/1998.”
4. In this case, the worker’
referral was successful
as against the employer. The worker did not conduct himself in any way that
compromised his entitlement
to costs. For these reasons I determine that the
employer pay the worker his costs upon the
5. In accordance
with r15(2) of the
Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Regulations 2011
fees in the bill of costs are to be at the rate of 85% of the fees set out in
of Schedule 1 to the
Supreme Court Rules 2000
