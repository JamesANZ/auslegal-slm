Scanning of driver�s licence as proof of identity or ID when entering a club or pub [2006] NSWPrivCmr 8 (1 July 2006)
Scanning of driver’s licence as proof of identity or ID when
entering a club or pub.
confirm their identity before being allowed to enter a NSW
club. Staff of the
club instructed the patron that their driver’s licence must be presented,
took possession of the licence
and then scanned it. The information detailed on
the licence was recorded on a compact disk.
The club had introduced scanning machines as an alternative to the manual
sign-in method. The club does provide an option for manual
sign-in but requires
some proof of age (the sign-in is done directly onto touch screens). The sign-in
slip has limited information
on it and includes a file identifier. Access to
this sign-in is limited to certain office staff in order to provide protection
loss of the sign-in slip and the patron’s details.
As part of the manual sign-in system the signed slips were kept in storage
for seven years. The club, however, felt that the data
was more secure and more
compact, when stored on a compact disk. It was club policy that access would
only be granted to the disk
to police and similar agencies.
It was the club’s view that patrons are responsible for placing their
cards in the scanning machine in accordance with the
Registered Clubs Act
The enquirer stated:
“None of this was pointed out to me, also the
fact that I was being signed in by a member of the club, should have negated the
requirement to provide a licence, also the Club Act only states that the name
and address need to be kept in a register, not your
licence and photo
The enquirier was not so much concerned about the scanning of the licence but
on the licence, for
example, copying of their signature. The information from the scanning process
was to be stored for seven years
in a fireproof safe.
The enquirer stated:
“These days, with the technology available and
identity theft becoming more prevalent, ANYONE with access to this information,
a computer, a “card” maker and the correct computer programs can
become me (or you for that matter)”.
Despite the club’s privacy officer’s assurance that replication
of the complainant’s details was not possible, the
patron was able to
demonstrate that it was possible.
The enquirier asked the privacy officer to view the licence data on the
“relative” scanning program, take a “screen
what appeared and then paste this into to a word document. The result was a
full copy of the licence including photo,
signature and all other details on a
word document. This document could be emailed, printed or faxed anywhere. The
main concern was
the fact that even the club’s privacy officer did not
realise this.
The Information Protection Principles in the
Information Protection Act 1998
only apply to public sector agencies.
Although clubs are registered under the
Registered Clubs Act 1976
they are private sector organisations and as such are more likely to be
subject to the Commonwealth
