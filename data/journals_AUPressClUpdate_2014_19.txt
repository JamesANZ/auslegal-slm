APC UPDATE | 26 September 2014
Summary of latest adjudication
Allan House / The Sydney Morning Herald
The Press Council has considered a complaint from Allan House concerning an
article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 February 2014
Rivulet which contributes to Sydney’s water catchment.
The article stated that iron concentrations in the rivulet were at levels
that exceeded Australian Drinking Water Guidelines by 30
per cent. It said
“the health of part of the water supply to Sydney’s 4.6 million
consumers” was “at stake”.
The Council considered that the article was inaccurate and unfair in
suggesting the iron levels posed a risk to the health of consumers.
The article
should have made it clear the level exceeded in the rivulet was an aesthetic
standard which only applied to filtered
water and was not a health-related
standard. Accordingly, this aspect of the complaint was upheld.

adjudication
The Council considered that use of the term “contamination” in
the article might have been accurate in a technical sense
but it was likely to
be misunderstood by many readers. On balance, the Council concluded that the
breach of its Standards was not
sufficiently significant for this aspect of the
complaint to be upheld. Read the full adjudication
Remedies without adjudication
A recent example of the Council helping to obtain a
remedy without referral to adjudication
A complaint that two articles in a metropolitan newspaper about rivalry in
the leadership of a community organisation incorrectly
reported the complainant
and two other people “took control” of the organisation’s
premises during a meeting and
had been “ousted” by security
Council staff worked with the complainant and the publication to achieve
mutually agreed-upon wording of a correction, making clear
that the complainant
and her colleagues had not been removed from the building. The correction was
published in both the print and
online editions of the publication.
