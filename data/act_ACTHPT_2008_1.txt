THE COMPLAINT
first complaint in this matter came to light on 20 February 2007 when the ACT
Medical Board (the Board) received a report concerning
the respondent from
another registered health professional who did not wish to be identified.
On 5 March 2007 the Board wrote to the
Chief Pharmacist for the ACT requesting information concerning the prescribing
patterns of
the respondent.
information was furnished on 20 March and further information was requested on
4 July and a report was provided to the Board
on 8 August 2007.
On 13 August the respondent was notified of
that report and further reports concerning him and the Applicant Board filed
its initial
application with this Tribunal.
that application dated 27 March 2008 the Board sought, inter alia, an emergency
order from this Tribunal for the suspension of
the Respondent�s registration
for a period of six months pursuant to Section 64(1)(j) of the
Health Professions Act 2004
(�the Act�).
In the alternative an order was sought that a condition be imposed on the
doctor�s registration prohibiting him from
prescribing a drug of dependence as
defined in the
Drugs of Dependence Act
, being morphine sulphate and oxycodone HCI.
matter came before the Tribunal for Directions on 7 April and a Deputy
President, apart from giving directions concerning the
future conduct of the
application, made the following order by consent:
�The Respondent
is not, without the Chief Health Officer�s approval to prescribe any drug of
dependence as outlined in Schedule
1 Part1.1 of the Criminal Code Regulations
2005 until further order of this Tribunal�
29 August the matter was listed for hearing on 24 November 2008 for 5 hearing
days. On 11 September by consent a further condition
was attached to the
interim order in that the doctor was prohibited from prescribing any
benzodiapazine drug
to any person until
the final determination of the proceedings.
The interim orders were extended until 24 November 2008.
Application dated 1 October 2008 the ACT Government Solicitor, the Solicitor
acting for the Board, filed a Further Amended Application
for cancellation of
the doctor�s registration.
The grounds
relied upon in support of this Application are:
� 1. Pursuant to section 137 of the Health
Professionals Regulation 2004 (the Regulation) the respondent has breached the
standard of practice by engaging in a standard of practice that
demonstrates a lack of competence to practise, a lack of skill,
judgment and a lack of care.

names of patients have been deleted in the above document in keeping with an
order of the Tribunal.
THE EVIDENCE
supporting the Application were filed with the Tribunal and served on the
Respondent.
Dr Michael Tedeschi is the
Senior Staff Specialist with the ACT Alcohol and Drug Program (ADP) at the
and he supplied a lengthy
statement with annexures which became an exhibit on the hearing of the matter.
The filed statements have
been produced in these reasons as the Respondent has
admitted the particulars of the complaint against him as set out above.
The statement of Dr Tedeschi reads in part:
�I have been provided with 3 folders of patient notes
and records in relation to consultations and prescriptions written by Dr David
Prosser for various patients that he has seen.
I have been asked to give my opinion on the following
questions, referring where applicable to the patient files:
Whether Dr Prosser has engaged in a standard of medical practice
that demonstrates a lack of competence to practise, or a lack of
skill, judgement or care in relation to the patients identified in the patient
Whether Dr Prosser has engaged in a standard of medical practice
that has endangered or endangers public health and safety;
Whether Dr Prosser has given a drug of
dependence or a prohibited substance to a drug dependent person in
circumstances where the
drug was not required for the medical treatment of the
person and/or was not given as part of a treatment plan for that person.
1. For the purpose of giving my opinion about those
questions, I have considered the Standards Statement entitled �Code of Conduct�
and �Prescribing of Benzodiazepines� approved by the ACT Medical Board as part
Health Professionals (ACT Medical
Boards Standards Statements) Approval 2006 (No. 1)
2.In giving my opinions, I have also had regard to
the approved product information for Kapanol (oral Morphine), MS Contin (oral
Morphine) and OxyContin (Oxycodone).
to practise, knowledge, skill, judgement or care
3. From my analysis of the patient files, I
identified 5 broad areas where, in my opinion, Dr Prosser engaged in a standard
of practice
that demonstrated a lack of competence, skill, judgement and
Those areas are as follows:
1. Unsafe prescribing, in the sense of his
prescribing unsafe doses of opiates to patients where there is no indication
had no knowledge of their prior tolerance to the drug.
2. Prescribing of opiate-related drugs where there
was no indication of why the drug was
prescribed, no plan for trialling the drug, and where briefly mentioned, no
apparent relationship between the drug prescribed
and the presenting complaint
of the patient.
3. A pattern of prescribing opiate-related drugs
and/or benzodiazepines at far shorter intervals than each prescription should
required, resulting in far larger quantities of drugs being prescribed and
dispensed, directly resulting in the patient receiving
amounts of drugs that
were medically unsafe.
4. Concurrent prescribing of different kinds of
benzodiazepine drugs at very high doses without any medical indication of the
for the prescriptions, and sometimes together with prescriptions for
opiate-related drugs. Also, benzodiazepines prescribed to patients
drug dependence, where such knowledge ought to have caused caution.
5. Medical notes that were either non-existent, or well
below the acceptable standard of medical notes that should be kept to evidence
the reasons for prescribing the various drugs mentioned in the notes. Basic
medical history taking, and basic medical examinations
were not recorded in the
notes I perused.
Area 1 - dangerous dosage of opiates
4. From the patient files, I identified at multiple
patients where, in my opinion, Dr Prosser prescribed highly dangerous levels
drugs to the patient.
5. Opioid drugs are prescribed cautiously by medical
practitioners as they can cause respiratory depression even at low doses in
non-tolerant patients. This advice, with suggested initial doses, is
highlighted in the Product Information .
6. In most cases, the doses prescribed by Dr Prosser
were of a level that could have resulted in death or serious morbidity, had
drugs been taken by a non drug-tolerant person. On several occasions, the
prescriptions were given at the first or second consultation
and with no
indication that Dr Prosser took a relevant history or conducted a basic medical
examination. In many cases, there is
no record to explain the circumstances or
reasons for why the drugs or the dosage of the drugs were prescribed.
7. I have difficulty explaining this pattern of
prescribing. It would seem that Dr Prosser was willing to accede to any request
that these patient made for opiate drugs. Given the amounts prescribed, the
short intervals between repeat prescriptions, and the
number of �lost
prescriptions� I can only conclude that Dr Prosser�s prescribing resulted in
the drugs acting to service the patient�s
(or their colleagues) drug addiction.
Area 2 � prescribing of opiates without
apparent clinical purpose
8. From the patient files, I identified multiple
patients where, in my opinion, Dr Prosser prescribed opiate-related drugs or
benzodiazepines
to the patient in circumstances where the patient�s complaint
on presentation did not in any reasonable way indicate a need for
the drug or
the dosage prescribed. The medical notes are extremely scant as to the
complaint at all, but where the complaint is
recorded in a word or two,
appropriate treatment either would not, in my opinion, indicate a need for
prescribed drugs at all,
or would indicate a need for mild pain relief drugs
only such as ibuprofen, paracetamol, or at the very most paracetamol/codeine.
Again, in most cases, the drugs and doses prescribed were of a kind and level
that could have resulted in death or serious morbidity,
had they been taken by
a non drug-tolerant person.
Area 3 � non-observance of intervals between
prescriptions
9. From the patient files, I identified at multiple
patients where, in my opinion, Dr Prosser, without proper and sufficient
gave further prescriptions for benzodiazepines (often multiple types)
or opiate drugs significantly more frequently than was required
according to
the prescribed intervals for the prescriptions given.
10. In the great majority of cases, the medical notes
contained only a few words apparently stated by the patient as to why a further
prescription was required prior to the expiry of the interval that should have
elapsed from the previous prescription.
After reading the notes, which indicate a pattern of reasons given by
patients as to why a further prescription was needed, there
was no doubt
whatsoever in my mind that:
(i) the reasons given by the patients as to why he or
she needed a further prescription were very obviously false;
(ii) There is no possibility whatsoever that any
medical practitioner, experienced or not, could have genuinely believed the
and variety of excuses that were proffered to Dr Prosser; and
(iii) Dr Prosser knew that these excuses were false,
but nevertheless chose in multiple instances to re-prescribe high doses of both
opiates and benzodiazepines.
11. In many cases, the patient notes record the
patient advising Dr Prosser that he or she was going away for a significant
usually between 10 and 21 days, and required a prescription for enough
opiates and/or benzodiazepine drugs to cover that period
of absence from
Yet, the notes invariably then record the
same patient returning to Dr Prosser for a further prescription a few days
after receiving
the earlier prescription, and again seeking a further
prescription for the same drugs. Seemingly oblivious to the fact that the
patient was meant to be �away�, in each case Dr Prosser gave the further
prescription to the patient. I have described below some
relevant details
regarding patients who sought and obtained further prescriptions from Dr
Prosser in this manner.
12. On no occasion in the notes I have perused, did I
find any record of Dr Prosser refusing a patient�s request for a further
prescription
to be given within the period that applied to a previous
prescription. This again resulted in excessive amounts of drugs being
prescribed and subsequently dispensed.
Area 4 - Concurrent prescribing of different
kinds of benzodiazepine drug
13. From the patient files, I identified numerous
patients who received concurrent prescriptions for different kinds of
benzodiazepines.
Generally, Dr Prosser
prescribed the following types of benzodiazepines: Valium, Serepax, Xanax,
Mogadon, and Rivotril.
14. In no case can I find any indication as to why
those concurrent prescriptions were provided. The need for different kinds of
benzodiazepines to be taken together is extremely unusual and almost never
medically indicated. Further, none of the patients presented
with a complaint,
which, in my opinion, indicated the medical need for different kinds of benzodiazepines
to be taken together.
15. In many cases, the benzodiazepines were
prescribed in very high doses, well above those doses medical practitioners
use for these drugs. Writing prescriptions in this manner is, in my
opinion, a potentially dangerous practice. Furthermore, several
of the patients
were, from the practice notes, known to be drug dependent indicating a need for
extreme caution.
16. In many cases, the combination prescriptions for
benzodiazepines were given together with prescriptions for large quantities
high doses of opiate drugs, particularly MS Contin.
In my opinion, the combination of prescribing
multiple different benzodiazepines and different kinds of opiates together was
dangerous to the patients. In my opinion, the combination of the various
benzodiazepines and opiate-related drugs being taken in
the manner prescribed,
even if the patient was drug tolerant, could result in death or serious
17. I am, or have been in the past, the treating
practitioner for several of the patients whose notes I have perused. Given the
as well as the frequency with which the prescriptions
were given, the only
reasonable conclusion I can reach is that the patient did not take the drugs as
prescribed. In my view, the
only plausible explanation for what became of the
drugs is that they were provided to another person or other persons. This fact
in itself is dangerous and represents a significant public health risk.
Area 5 - Inadequate medical notes
18. From the patient files, the medical notes in
almost every case, if not every case, were in my opinion well below the
expected of a competent general practitioner.
19. Whilst the computer program used by Dr Prosser�s
practice automatically records the prescriptions issued as a patient file note,
there is no other attempt to record even the most basic aspect of the
consultations.
Doctor�s notes, by and
large, document a history, an examination, a diagnosis and a treatment plan. In
Dr Prosser�s case, there
are at best one or two words, which appear to do no
more than state in the most abbreviated terms the complaint made by the patient
and the reason for the consultation, which, in turn, has led to the
prescriptions given.
20. In many cases, other than the prescription, there
is no file note as to the reason for the consultation. This is well below a
minimum standard of notes that is required from a medical practitioner to
document a consultation. When medical practitioners prescribe
opioid drugs, the
decision is not taken lightly. It is almost universal to witness careful
histories, examinations, and documentation
of the reasons behind that step, and
careful documentation of the future plan of treatment. In Dr Prosser�s case,
there is almost
nothing to document the need for, or reasoning behind the
decision to use opiates. In those cases where a high dose of opiate medication
is prescribed, there ought to be a substantial history taken, an examination of
the patient and a documented plan of treatment
to justify the use of potent
drugs with potential dangers, and side effects.
In no case, did I see patient notes to evidence that this occurred
21. In my opinion, this failing also occurred with
regard to the prescribing of benzodiazepines.
In my opinion, the prescribing I have seen in these records has occurred
contrary to the ACT Medical Boards standards statement for
prescribing of
benzodiazepines.
22. In some cases, Dr Prosser has prescribed high
doses of opiate medication and/or benzodiazepines, often at the initial
consultation
with him, without there being any information in the notes to
record whether the patient was currently, or may in the past have
been addicted
to drugs of dependence, and therefore whether the patient may have had any
level of drug tolerance. In my opinion,
that prescribing was highly dangerous
in that the prescribed doses of the drugs were well above levels that could
have been lethal
to a non-tolerant patient (or even a drug-tolerant patient)
In other cases, Dr Prosser has prescribed high doses
of opiate medication and/or benzodiazepines in circumstances where the notes
record that the patient is or has been addicted to drugs of dependence. In my
opinion, that raises different issues, where the
prescribing would result in
servicing the person�s addiction rather than forming part of any treatment plan
for trying to address
the addiction. In my opinion, many of these prescribed
drugs end up being diverted for injection (as opposed to ingestion) and sale
the �street�. This constitutes a serious public health risk.
23. In paragraph 34, I have grouped the patients
which illustrate in my opinion the various failings listed in paragraph 10
where there is no information in the notes to record that Dr Prosser
knew the patient was addicted to drugs of dependence.
24. In paragraph 41, I have grouped the patients
where the notes record that the patient is or has been addicted to drugs of
dependence,
and where I therefore reasonably conclude that Dr Prosser ought to
have known (from reading the notes from his own practice) that
the patient was
addicted to drugs of dependence.
patient files also demonstrate the failings described in paragraph 10 above.
Endangering
public health and safety
25. In my opinion, the nature and frequency of
episodes where I regard the standard of treatment as falling well below a
acceptable level are so significant that they constituted an
endangering of public health and safety.
There are many aspects of Dr Prosser�s standard of practice that cause
me to hold that view which I have outlined in this statement.
26. Firstly, the clinical notes demonstrate a ready
preparedness on Dr Prosser�s part to prescribe opiates and/or benzodiazepines
seemingly on demand, without the precaution of a proper medical consultation or
consideration of an appropriate treatment plan.
By prescribing drugs of dependence in this manner, the patients
concerned were able to obtain drugs, which, in my opinion, were well
clinical indications given. That availability, in turn, either exacerbated
existing drug dependence by those patients
so identified, or were dangerous for
those in whom Dr Prosser had no knowledge of prior tolerance. Such prescribing
both directly
and indirectly leads to other public health issues such as the
potential for overdose, motor vehicle accidents, and diversion of
the drugs to
unknown sources.
27. Secondly, the frequency with which prescriptions
were given was so far outside that which would have been expected from each
prescription that there was an extensive quantity of opiates and
benzodiazepines made available to these patients.
In my view, the drugs as prescribed were
substantially beyond the needs of the particular patients in question.
The end result of this propensity to
�re-prescribe� is that substantial quantities of drugs were available that
exceeded the needs
of the patients.
Those drugs, having been dispensed, were then within the community
without an appropriate medical purpose.
In my view, the sheer quantity of drugs made available in the community
because of Dr Prosser�s prescribing itself represented a
significant danger to
public health and safety, as we do not know the manner and circumstance in
which those drugs were ingested,
or possibly injected or distributed.
28. Thirdly, the treatment of drug dependence is a
difficult and challenging problem in our community.
For those who seek treatment, extensive
resources, time and professional assistance is employed to assist drug
dependent patients
to manage their dependence.
Where drug dependent persons are able to obtain opiates and
benzodiazepines on demand from outside treatment clinics, their progress
treatment is, in my opinion, seriously undermined.
It is impossible to effectively treat drug
dependence where there is an uncontrolled supply of drugs from multiple
sources. Dr Prosser�s
prescribing habits, in my opinion, had this result. In undermining
the treatment progress of multiple patients, (and, indirectly,
those to whom
prescribed drugs may have been distributed on the �street�), his treatment
endangered public health and safety.
Drugs of dependence to a drug dependent
29. In the course of analysing the patient files, I
noted numerous patients to whom Dr Prosser prescribed a drug of dependence
the patient notes clearly recorded that the patient was a drug dependent
person, and where, in my opinion, the drug was not required
for the complaint
made on presentation and the drug was not given as part of any treatment plan
for the person. In my opinion,
the only credible explanation for the patient
seeking these prescriptions was to support their drug dependence. The end
of such prescribing would have been to service the person�s drug
dependence.
30. In some cases in the files I have examined, the
Chief Health Officer had written to Dr Prosser reminding him that no approval
had been given, yet the notes record that Dr Prosser then prescribed a drug of
dependence to that person.
Summary of findings and conclusion
42. Having carefully examined the medical files and
documents relating to these patients I have serious concerns about the conduct
of the prescribing practitioner, the care these patients received, but also the
wider implications of this pattern of prescribing
on the general community
43. The prescribing of opioid drugs for chronic
non-malignant pain is a complex medical issue that is undertaken cautiously by
practitioners, yet I have seen ample evidence of huge doses of these
drugs being repeatedly prescribed by Dr Prosser for non-existent
reasons. The documentation of why and under what reasoning these drugs were
being prescribed is either completely lacking,
or given as a one or two word
entries such as �sore wrist�.
44. The doses of these drugs prescribed by Dr Prosser
are usually well above recommended levels, and much of the time there is
prescribing
of potentially highly dangerous doses
- often at an initial consultation.
45. The opioids are often prescribed at short
intervals that bear no relation to the amounts given � i.e. a patient given a
prescription
of 20 tablets, where the dose prescribed would last 10 days, is
often given another prescription after 4 or 5 days or even less
in some cases.
If this were to happen once or twice per year to a patient, that may be
understandable, but looking through just
these few files of Dr Prosser�s, there
are many instances where an excuse is given by a patient for a lost prescription
other reason for needing another prescription, and the prescription is
promptly replaced. Given that a significant number of the
patients whose files
I have seen are identified as drug dependent (and many of the patients are
known personally to me and are
under my care), it is a fair assumption that
these opioids were diverted to others for injection or street sale. This
to me a serious public health risk.
46. I have been in the Alcohol and Drug field for 24
years, as well as a lecturer in general practice and a general practitioner
myself. I have spent my career giving advice to general practitioners on how to
use opioid drugs rationally and safely, and my
review of these files caused me
extreme concern. I have never been one to criticise colleagues lightly, however
in my entire career
I have never seen inappropriate prescribing of these drugs
on the scale and magnitude which I have witnessed in this case.
47. I find Dr Prosser�s notes bordering on
non-existent and well below the standard I would expect from a reasonable
general practitioner.
I find his prescribing of opioid and benzodiazepines
drugs reckless, irresponsible and dangerous, and thus his care of patients
these instances grossly lacking. �

these proceedings.
In that she said:
� 1. I am employed with ACT Health. I hold the
administrative position of Chief Pharmacist, within an administrative arm of
Health known as the Health Protection Service.
2. By instrument dated 6 March 2006, and pursuant to
s. 203 of the
Drugs of Dependence Act
, (DOD Act), the Chief Health Officer delegated to me and other Health
Protection Service officers certain of his powers and functions
under the DOD
This delegation remains operative.
3. In particular, the Chief Health Officer has
delegated to me and others including the Deputy Chief Pharmacist the power,
s. 69 of the DOD Act, to grant approvals to �doctors� (as defined in the
Dictionary to the
Legislation Act 2001
to prescribe drugs of dependence.
4. For the purpose of enabling me and others
including the Deputy Chief Pharmacist to exercise our powers and functions
DOD Act, the Health Protection Service maintains the following
records, among others:
(i) Records of applications by doctors for approval
to prescribe a drug of dependence to a person, and the determination of those
applications; and
the information provided under s. 98 of the DOD Act by persons (usually
pharmacists) who have supplied a drug of dependence
to another person.
5. Pursuant to s. 58(3) of the DOD Act, a doctor must
not, without the Chief Health Officer�s approval, prescribe a drug of
for the treatment of a person if the doctor believes, on reasonable
grounds, that the person is:
dependent person�, as defined in s. 3 of the DOD Act, in relation to any drug
of dependence or prohibited substances (unless
s. 58(4) applies); or
�����������
person who has used a drug of dependence continuously for longer than 2 months,
or for periods that, taken together, is longer
than 2 months.
6. Pursuant to s. 68 of the DOD Act, for the purpose
of obtaining approval from the Chief Health Officer to prescribe a drug of
dependence for the treatment of a person, a doctor must lodge an application
with the Health Protection Service for approval to
prescribe that drug of
dependence to that person.
7. Pursuant to s. 69 of the DOD Act, I and others
including the Deputy Chief Pharmacist, as delegates of the Chief Health
determine applications by doctors for approval to prescribe a drug of
dependence or refer the application to the drugs advisory
committee established
under s. 66 of the DOD Act.
8. In each case, an application for approval must
identify (among other things) the name and address of the doctor who has
for approval, the name and address of the person for whom the doctor
proposes to prescribe a drug of dependence and various particulars
of the drug
to be prescribed including its name, form, strength, daily dosage, quantity,
repeat prescriptions and the intervals
between prescriptions.
The doctor is also required to complete the
statement �I consider the patient is/ is not a drug dependent person.
(Delete whichever does not apply)�.
The application is made pursuant to a
standard form.
9. Methadone and buprenorphine are both drugs of
dependence as provided by
of Dependence Regulation 2005
and, therefore by reference, Schedule 1, Part
Criminal Code Regulation 2005
Pursuant to s. 59 of the DOD Act, these drugs
may only be prescribed to a drug-dependant person with the approval of the
Chief Health
officer or his/her delegate.
10. In each case where a doctor applies for approval
to prescribe a drug of dependence to a person, the Health Protection Service
creates an individual file for the person to whom the drug is to be
administered (�the patient file�).
file remains operative for all further applications by that doctor or any other
doctor for approval to prescribe a drug of
dependence to that person, together
with any other relevant dealings concerning that person.
11. The Health Protection Service maintains a
to a person (�the approvals database�).
The approvals database records information
provided with each approval, drawing on the information provided by the doctor
application for approval. The information recorded on the approvals
to whom the
doctor may prescribe the drug of dependence and various details about the drug
that may be prescribed to that person.
12. I have prepared an extract of the approvals
granted to Dr David Prosser to prescribe drugs of dependence.
13. For the purposes of discharging their obligations
under s. 98 of the DOD Act, pharmacists in the Territory provide to the Health
Protection Service, on a monthly basis, information about the drugs of
dependence that they have dispensed on prescription including
details of the
drug/s dispensed, the names and addresses of the persons to whom those drugs have
been dispensed, the dates when
the drugs were dispensed and the name of the
persons (usually doctors) who prescribed the drugs.
14. The Health Protection Service receives that
information from pharmacists under s. 98 of the DOD Act and then enters the
information
into a database maintained by the Health Protection Service (�the
prescriptions database�).
15. I have prepared an extract from the prescriptions
the reported occasions when pharmacists have dispensed drugs of dependence in
the Territory on prescriptions written by Dr Prosser.
The database identified
1,664 occasions on which this occurred, together with information about the
drug of dependence dispensed
on each occasion.
16. I have caused an analysis to be conducted of the
extracts of the prescriptions database.to identify whether the Health
Service held a patient file in relation to the persons to whom Dr
Prosser had written a prescription for a drug of dependence.
17. From that analysis, I have caused a table to be
prepared recording the names and addresses of the persons for whom Dr Prosser
wrote a prescription for a drug of dependence between 1 January 2004 and 31
March 2008; whether the Health Protection Service held
a patient file for the
person; and other relevant details about the person in those cases where it did
hold a file.
18. The analysis identified 184 persons to whom a
drug of dependence was dispensed on a prescription written by Dr Prosser. The
analysis demonstrated that of those 184 persons:
60 persons received prescriptions written by Dr
Prosser in circumstances where the Health Protection Service has no record of
application by anyone for approval to prescribe a drug of dependence to
that person, and therefore no patient file for that person
71 additional persons received prescriptions
for a drug of dependence written by Dr Prosser in circumstances where the
Health Protection
Service holds a patient file for the person, but has no
record of an application by Dr Prosser for approval to prescribe a drug
dependence of any kind to that person;
�����������
Of the 71 persons referred to in
paragraph (ii) above, 52 persons were or were at some stage the subject of an
approval granted
to another doctor to prescribe methadone to that person;
�����������
Of the 52 persons referred to in
paragraph (iii) above, in 31 cases the prescriptions written by Dr Prosser for
a drug of dependence
were not in accordance with an approval given to Dr
Prosser under s. 69 of the DOD Act;
19. I have reviewed the 71 patient files referred to
in paragraph 18(ii) above, where Dr Prosser prescribed a drug of dependence
the person without approval, and the prescriptions database for those 71
Of the 71 persons referred to
in paragraphs 18(ii) above, 38 persons received drugs of dependence
continuously from Dr Prosser for
a period longer than 2 months. A copy of the
patient files for those 38 persons is annexed to this statement and marked �
20. I have also conducted an analysis of the
prescriptions written by Dr Prosser, as set out in the extract of the
prescriptions
December 2007 inclusive.
I have grouped
the drugs of dependence prescribed by Dr Prosser by reference to those drugs
that are forms of morphine sulphate,
and those drugs that are forms of
oxycodone hydrochloride.
I have also
conducted an analysis of the prescriptions written by all doctors in the
Territory (including Dr Prosser) for these
kinds of drugs of dependence during
the same period.
I prepared a table
identifying the proportions of those 2 kinds of drugs prescribed by Dr Prosser,
and the proportions of those
kinds of drugs prescribed by other doctors in the
Territory during that period. A copy of that table is at Annexure �
21. From the table at Annexure �G�, I have noted that
the prescriptions for MS Contin 100mg and Oxycontin 80mg are substantially
variance with the proportions in which those drugs in those strengths have been
prescribed by other doctors in the Territory.
22. For the purpose of monitoring, and trying to
obtain, compliance with s. 58(3) of the DOD Act, the Health Protection Service
conducts an ongoing analysis of the approvals database referred to in paragraph
11 above and its patient files to ascertain whether
an approval may have been
required and had not been applied for or given to a doctor (and which doctor)
for the purpose of prescribing
the applicable drug of dependence to the person
Where the analysis indicates
that a doctor may have written a prescription for a drug of dependence without
approval from the Chief
Health Officer, and contrary to s. 58(3), the Health
Protection Service sends a letter to that doctor to remind the doctor of his
her obligations to obtain approval under the DOD Act to prescribe a drug of
dependence to a person, where s. 58(3) applies.
On 42 occasions, in the period 1 January 2005 to 1
January 2008 inclusive, the Health Protection Service sent a letter to Dr
reminding him of his obligations under s. 58(3) of the DOD Act.
A copy of those letters is annexed to this
statement and marked �
a statement dated 4 November 2008 and filed with the Tribunal the doctor
�I admit the
particulars of the complaints against me.
I further admit that I showed a lack of skill and judgment in respect to
my conduct which is the subject of the complaints.
I do not, however, admit that I lack
competence to practice (sic) medicine.�
admission the respondent has admitted the truth of the particulars as set out
in the Further Amended Application for cancellation
of his right to practise
medicine as filed with the Tribunal on 1 October 2008.
statement the Doctor further said
�I found that I
was spending an increasing amount of my professional time treating patients who
were seeking drugs. For light of
that, I now know that I should have devoted
time to ensuring that my knowledge was up to
date in relation to prescribing benzodiazepines and narcotics. I felt, wrongly,
my knowledge in those aspects was sufficient.�
as prescribing oxycontin to patient E the doctor acknowledged that he should
not have prescribed narcotics once he became
aware she was an addict and was
being treated with methadone. He stated it was �unacceptable� for him not to
have liaised with
her methadone prescriber in relation to her treatment.
further admitted that at the time he prescribed it he was not aware that
phenobarbitone was a well known drug of abuse
and acknowledged that he should
have been so aware.
Dr Jennifer
Thompson, consultant psychiatrist, gave evidence before the Tribunal and her
five page report tendered. In that she
said that the doctor told her that he been
foolish and na�ve in his dealings with his patients. It was reported that, at a
not specified, the doctor had been criticised by a Coroner in his findings
for not �keeping adequate notes�. It was further reported
that he did not
regard his addicted patients as addicts and �sympathised with them�. The doctor
had advised Dr Thompson that had
�always used opiates meticulously�. He trusted
patents and believed their �stories�. In Dr Thompson�s opinion Dr Prosser was
�physically
healthy and mentally alert, grossly cognitively intact�inevitably
with aging his ability to learn new ideas and take in current
drug policies and
new information about drugs is slightly impaired. His ideas about
benzodiazepines are still fixed on the original
introduction of the drugs. At
that time, and now, they are extremely useful and effective drugs used in many situations,
danger of habituation and addiction were not recognised, and Dr Prosser
is unwilling to accept this. Despite previous warnings he
did not stop his
practices of prescribing excessive amounts of benzodiazepines. To a lesser
extent he has also applied this to
schedule 8 drugs.�
Tribunal notes that this report is based on an interview with the Respondent
lasting in excess of one hour and did not involving
any formal cognitive
testing or brain imaging.
put references before the Tribunal from people whose families he had attended
as their general practitioner for periods
in excess of forty years in two
instances, since 1976 for another and twenty-three years for the fourth. The
doctor who has employed
Dr Prosser as a locum for the past two years, during
which time the incidents, the subject of the Board�s complaint arose, said
his reference of 18 November 2008
�I have always found Dr Prosser to be a conscientious
medical practitioner who is dedicated to the well being of
all his patients�
To my knowledge Dr Prosser is held in high esteem by his
peers and colleagues.
I believe Dr Prosser is genuinely saddened that his
behaviour in prescribing these medication (sic) may have caused harm to his
patients or the practice.�
reference is from a medical practitioner who stated that he had known Dr
Prosser since 1980 and had worked in partnership
with him for two years until
the end of 2005.
The medical
practitioner states:
�At a professional level, Dr Prosser has a wealth of
experience and expertise that the modern doctor can but dream of.
His career spans the time period before the
profession was inundated with specialists and, as a consequence, there is not
Dr Prosser does not know.�
referees speak of the doctor as a person of high moral standards who has served
them well and above expectation as their general
practitioner.
This doctor
also presented evidence through his counsel and by consent put before the
Tribunal that he could continue as a locum
within the medical practice in which
he worked if the Tribunal allowed this to occur.
Tribunal notes that no evidence has been put before it relating to the type of
practice that Dr Prosser conducted immediately
prior to the hearing of this
matter on 24 November. The doctor in his evidence stated that he presently saw
between 20 and 25 patients
per day but there is no evidence as to the nature of
his practice.
There was significant
cross examination of him relating to his treatment of and prescribing practices
for some of the patients mentioned
in the material put before Tribunal.
professions tribunal is established under Section 40(1) of the Act and one of
its functions is to �hear applications
from health profession boards to suspend
or cancel the registration of health professionals�.
and second grounds relied upon by the Applicant in support of its
application
allege that the Respondent
has breached the standard of practice required by Regulation 137 of the Health
Professionals Regulation
2004 (the Regulations). That Regulation provides:
�A registered
health professional breaches the required standard of practice if the health professional
engages in a standard of
practice that demonstrates a lack of competence to
practise, knowledge, skill, judgment or care by the health professional�.
further alleged that the respondent breached the standard of practice required
by the Regulations in that he engaged in a
standard of practice that endangered
public health and safety. Regulation 133 provides that the purpose for Chapter
4 of the Regulations
is to set out �the required standard of practice that, if
breached, will mean the health professional is not competent to practise�.
required standard of practice is set out in Part 4.2 of the Regulations and
Regulation 143 provides that a health professional
must not give a drug of
dependence or a prohibited substance to a drug-dependent person unless it is
required for the treatment
of the person and is part of a treatment plan for
the person.
ground relied upon by the Applicant in support of its application alleges a
breach of the required standard of practice
as set out in that Regulation.
Regulation 138 provides that if a health
professional breaches Part 4.2 of the Regulations he or she breaches the
required standard
of practice and �is not competent to practise unless the health
profession board decides otherwise�.
provision contained in Regulation 138 is somewhat curious.
The respondent, by his admissions contained
in his statement of 4 November, has admitted the particulars of the allegations
against him by the Board.
doing so he has admitted a breach of Regulation 137 which means that he has
breached the required standard of practice and a
further breach as alleged by
non compliance with the required standard of practice. As such he is
statutorily declared to be not
competent to practice unless the board decides
otherwise. This is an anomalous situation which is well illustrated by this
complaint received by the board was in February 2007. The doctor has admitted
that through 2007, by his conduct and by
virtue of Regulation 137 he was a
person �not competent to practice�. Albeit this was so, he continued to
practice until his registration
was cancelled by this Tribunal in November
2008. As was submitted a doctor who admits or is found to have breached the
Regulations
a decade earlier would have continued to practice until his right
to do so was removed some years later, practising all the time
whilst not being
competent at law to do so.
This result
would seem to be absurd.
SUBMISSIONS
Submissions
on behalf of the Board urged the Tribunal to make the orders sought and
reliance was placed on the cases of Dr Ralph
Desmond Pearson [2003] MPBV 15 of
5 August 2003; and Dr David John Mackay Smith [2006] QHPT 002 of 16 June 2006
Counsel for
Dr Prosser handed written submissions to the Tribunal. We do not propose
setting out submissions but must address some
of those put forward on the
doctor�s behalf. It was submitted that
��The onus on
(sic) establishing the allegations, and the orders claimed by the applicant to
follow from the facts as found, rests
on the applicant from first to last.�
submission, with respect, is not correct and does not accord with law. Had the
allegations been contested the submission was
correct and the onus would have
been cast on the complaining board to establish its allegations to the standard
set out in the
submission. The doctor, by his admissions, has admitted the
particulars of the allegations brought against him. There is no onus
the board to establish to any standard the penalty that should be imposed.
Penalty is a matter for the Tribunal to impose
in its discretion and according
to law and no onus rests on the board.
further submitted that to order that Dr Prosser�s registration be cancelled
should be an order of �last resort�. There is
no legislative or legal basis for
such a submission. The Tribunal is empowered under Section 64 of the Act to
order any one or
more of the remedies set out in paragraphs (a) to (m) of
subsection (1) of that Section. The Tribunal has an unfettered discretion
make appropriate orders.
Counsel for
the Doctor also referred the Tribunal to the cases of
Dr Adolph Brauner of 15 May 1989 and Dr
Michael Tsouroutis of 9 June 2005.
Tribunal ordered pursuant to
(1) (k) of the
Health Professionals Act
that the registration of Dr David Prosser be cancelled.
This order was made on 25 November 2008
together with a further order that the names of any patient mentioned in
documents put before
the Tribunal should not be published.
in his evidence both in evidence-in-chief and in cross-examination and by his
admission in the filed document has admitted
to and has had proven against him
an inappropriate level of record keeping and a
failure to record reasons for prescribing drugs of dependence. He did
not appear to the Tribunal to appreciate the gravamen of this.
In each patient record to which his attention
was directed in evidence he indicated that, although the record did not disclose
inquiries he made before dispensing addictive substances in quantities
that could have proved lethal, he �would have� conducted
appropriate enquiries
and examinations.
Those records were not
kept to a standard that is required of a professional medical practice.
The doctor,
as part of his assertion of professional self-reformation strenuously and
persistently asserted that since the matters
before the Tribunal were brought
to his attention his patient notes have been kept at an appropriate level.
An examination of his records available to
the Tribunal fails to substantiate this assertion.
In the Tribunal�s view this continued failure
is made more culpable given the statement of Dr Thompson that Dr Prosser had
been criticized by a Coroner in an inquiry relating to a death for his
lack of appropriate record keeping.
dependence results in a need for larger amounts of the substance to be
dispensed in order to overcome the built up tolerance
to it due to its use over
a period of time.
One means of treating
a drug dependence is through pharmacotherapy by using, for example, drug
therapies to suppress the craving
for the substance.
The types of drugs used to treat existing
conditions must be selected carefully and professionally as they themselves may
be addictive
and conflict with the attempts to overcome a previous addiction
through pharmacotherapy.
by his admission and through the evidence he gave before the Tribunal showed at
the time of prescribing benzodiazapines
he had no professional understanding of
the effect of such use by persons seeking to overcome further addictive
substances by the
use of methadone.
Chief Pharmacist�s evidence set out above to which Dr Prosser admitted is that
for 71 patients he had prescribed a drug of dependence
without the appropriate
consent legislatively required and of those 71 patients 52 had at some stage
had approvals granted for
the prescription of methadone from another
Methadone is a substance used to
assist in overcoming addiction.
Dr Thompson
in her report stated that �He felt he had always used opiates
meticulously�.
It is not entirely clear
what the doctor meant by this statement but she further stated that Dr Prosser
was not aware of the dangers
of �habituation and addiction� and, according to
her, is still unwilling to accept it.
This unwillingness flies in the face of sound medical research and
indicates a lack of understanding through either an unreasonable
accept appropriately proven fact or a failure to either research the effect of
prescribing such substances or a flagrant
failure to keep up with self
failure, for whatever culpable reason, has had, in the Tribunal�s view, an
undermining of the legitimate attempts to effectively
treat drug dependent
persons by prescribing what Dr Tedeschi described in his statement as �an
uncontrolled supply of drugs from
multiple sources�.
Further, there can be no doubt from the
material put before the Tribunal that the circumstances in which drugs were
prescribed and
the dosages at which they were supplied could have �resulted in
death or serious morbidity� had they been taken by a non drug tolerant
Dr Prosser has admitted this.
inconceivable, in the Tribunal�s view, that Dr Prosser was not aware at the
time he prescribed as he did that he was prescribing
for drug dependent
His evidence was, effectively,
that he prescribed �on demand�.
that he naively believed each patient as each requested, for example, oxycontin
for complaints he never recorded, being
satisfied, for reasons not recorded,
that the person for whom he was prescribing was a drug tolerant person such as
to enable him
to prescribe in amounts that could otherwise be lethal or result
in serious morbidity in circumstances where he had no authority,
as required
legislatively, for so prescribing.
Tribunal�s view the varied areas from which the patients came with no recorded
prior treating doctor asserting that each
was presently taking a drug of
dependence and requesting more of the same should have alerted the doctor to
the fact that those
patients were not after pain relief as such.
A perusal of the patient records shows them
to be residing in Boorowa, Gilmore, Downer, Braddon, Queanbeyan, Lyons, Narrabundah,
Oakes Estate, Rivett, Isaacs, Reid, Ainslie, Lyneham and a variety of Belconnen
The doctor�s surgery was in
the litany of inherently unbelievable excuses given for seeking a further
prescription in circumstances where the previous
prescription should not have
�run out� if the substances were taken as prescribed should have alerted any
professional member of
the medical profession that there was something amiss
with his prescribing requests, i.e. he was being used as a tool to feed an
addiction and perhaps to enable drugs of dependence to be sold on the street
without any medical supervision to those who had such
an addiction.
than forty occasions from January 2006 until August 2007 Health Protective
Services advised Dr Prosser in writing that he
had either not sought approval
under the legislation to prescribe a drug of dependence or alternatively he had
prescribed a drug
of dependence otherwise than in accordance with a granted
approval. This correspondence and the sheer bulk of it does not seem to
caused him to alter his delinquent prescribing practices in any way.
example of the above we set out the following history for patient F.
This clearly illustrates the serious lack of
skill and care that Dr Prosser exercised in prescribing drugs of dependence.
doctor�s records show Patient F as first visiting him on 19 January 2007.
Patient F is said to have a right hip dysplasia and
to be awaiting for
peritabukar osteotomy operation and to be taking one oxycontin daily.
The doctor has noted the file where the
patient lives and he prescribed oxycontin and serepax.
He continued to prescribe oxycontin on the
following dates:
1 and 12 February
1, 16 and 29 March
- 13, 20, 30 April.
Serepax was
prescribed also on each of these occasions.
January 2007 the patient had signed a benzodiazepine voluntary undertaking for
a period of six months for the purpose of preventing
her from obtaining
prescriptions for that drug of dependence from more than one doctor.
Patient F agreed to receive her prescriptions
from a doctor at a different medical practice and to have the prescriptions
at particular pharmacy.
of the prescriptions filled for oxycontin for the same period for the patient
shows that Patient F was also prescribed
by other doctors on the following
6,27 February
8,15, 26 March
5, 12, 23 April
On 19 April
2007 the Deputy Chief Pharmacist in a letter addressed to Dr Prosser and the
two other medical practitioners who had
prescribed oxycontin to the patient
during this period noted that a drug of dependence was being prescribed and
dispensed at various
pharmacies in a situation where there was no �current
approval to prescribe a drug of dependence� for the patient.
The requirement for such approval under the
Drugs of Dependence Act 1989
was set out.
Attached to that letter was a schedule of prescriptions dispensed for
the period 19 January 2007 to 26 March 2007.
of this attachment must have alerted any prudent, professional medical
practitioner that this patient at very least was
doctor shopping, visiting
three different doctors within the period, two on the same day and on eleven
separate occasions within
a three month period.
other prescribing Doctors wrote back to the Deputy Chief Pharmacist and advised
him that she had not been aware that
the patient had been seeing Dr Prosser and
that she had telephoned him.
also advised the patient that she would not be prescribing oxycontin for her in
the future.
On 9 May 2007 the voluntary
agreement was terminated at the request of the patient.
Dr Prosser did nothing, it would seem in
relation to the receipt of the letter except it would seem from a perusal of
that he suggested the patient find a doctor closer to home.
the patient again visited the doctor and the surgery notes show �States trouble
finding dr near home� and a further entry
�I state last script�.
Oxycontin and serepax were prescribed.
There was no approval in place for the doctor
to prescribe oxycontin and he must have been on notice of this both from the
from the Deputy Chief Pharmacist and the other doctor who said she rang
On 26 May the patient visited
another doctor in the practice and following a full assessment relating to a mental
health care plan
in which it was said that Patient F had been on oxycontin and
serepax for the past five months she was once again prescribed those
substances.
Patient F again attended the doctor and was prescribed oxycontin and serepax.
Patient F again attended on 7 June and stated
that she was going away for the long weekend and was prescribed the same
On 13 June patient F attended and
�States she had lost everything in the river� and prescribed the same again. On
20 June she was
again prescribed oxycontin with a notation �This will be the
last oxy presc unless advised by specialists�.
Further prescriptions were written on 27 June, 7 July when the notation
is made �Operation on 20 July so this is the last oxy prescription�,
with the notation �My last script ever�.
Then on 16 July the patient attended and received another prescription
for oxycontin and the file is marked �States airline miss
placed a bag with
medication�.
The final notation for that
visit is �Goodbye.
I have stated that I
am not going to be treating similar cases in future�.
the patient presented again and it would appear that the Doctor declined to
prescribe any medication for her after she
had told him that her operation had
been put back 10 days. He checked with the list clerk at the hospital and found
The prescribed drug
of dependence was changed to oxynorm capsules and oxycodone hydrochloride
tablets on 3 August.
On 11 August she
obtained similar prescriptions from another doctor in the practice.
August 2007 the Deputy Chief Pharmacist again wrote to the Doctor and two other
doctors and informed them that there was no
current approval to prescribe a
drug of dependence in force for the patient.
Again, attached to this notice is a print out for the period 9 May 2007
until 16 July 2007 and shows eight prescriptions written
for oxycontin by three
different doctors during the period and that the prescriptions were filled at
three different pharmacies.
Opioid drugs were prescribed by the Doctor with the
last prescription being on 5 November 2007.
The file notes on 14 November �Authority for oxys withdrawn�.
points to deficiencies in the regulatory system in place whether these are
statutorily or personally based.
would seem that the dispensing pharmacies were fulfilling their obligations as
required concerning the dispensing of prescriptions
for a drug of
dependence.
Apart from notices
indicating prescribing without the appropriate approval or prescribing outside
it nothing further seems to have
been done to enquire about the legitimacy of
prescribing a drug of addiction by three separate medical practitioners on
occasions over a three month period.
Counsel for the Board advised that on his instructions the Health
Protection Services were of the view that considerations of privacy
it from taking a pro-active role in notifying what clearly was an episode of
�doctor shopping� by a drug dependent person
for supplies of a drug of
dependence.
This was the very practice
that the legislation was introduced to stamp out.
In the Tribunal�s view much of the danger
engendered to the community might have been avoided by the earlier intervention
relevant authorities and we pass no comment on the view held by Health Protective
history also points to the serious, flagrant and continued breaches of the
requirements that are put in place to protect
the community when prescribing
drugs of dependence.
It is but one
example of the many put before the Tribunal which show what must amount to
professional incompetence. Further it illustrates
the necessity for regulatory
authorities to ensure that their procedures provide a workable, effective
regime to stamp out the
aberrant practices the purpose for which they were
established. It is not clear from this case that this has been effected
appropriately.
In deciding
penalty the Tribunal has considered the extensive service to the medical
profession given by this member who is approaching
his eightieth year.
His personal references speak highly of him
as a man and as a respected member of the community.
The submissions and cases cited in those
submissions have been considered.
Tribunal�s view the allegations contained in the documents filed given the
sheer number and the seriousness of them and given
the lack of evidence that
the doctor has mended his aberrant record keeping practices and his failure, it
would seem, to recognize
the seriousness of his conduct and its potential effect
on the public can lead to only one order and that is as was made on 25
I certify that this and the 39
pages are a true copy of the
and reasons of the Tribunal.
