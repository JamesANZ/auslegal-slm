Herbert -v- Padovan [2015] NTRTCmr 10 (12 March 2015)
REASONS FOR THE ORDER OF THE COMMISSIONER OF TENANCIES
INQUIRY - Wednesday, 11 March 2015
COLIN HERBERT AND NINA HERBERT (‘tenants’)
VITTORIO PADOVAN (‘landlord’)
RT1415-0402
is a determination of an application dated 7 January 2015 by the tenants,
Colin and Nina Herbert, seeking orders for return of the security deposit
pursuant to section 113 of the
Residential Tenancies Act
Act”). The application is made in respect of premises being 1/52 Aralia
Street, Nightcliff in the Northern
Territory of Australia (‘the
premises’).
Notice of Inquiry dated 19 February 2015 was posted to the parties. The Inquiry
was conducted on Wednesday, 11 March 2015 during
which evidence was taken from
Rebecca Want de Rowe of Want de Rowe Real Estate on behalf of the landlord
(“the landlord”).
Herbert phoned NTCAT on 27 February 2015 and requested that he appear via
telephone at the Inquiry. He provided a mobile phone
number as his contact
number. At the Inquiry repeated attempts were made to call Mr Herbert and on
each occasion the call went unanswered.
I had concerns about procedural aspects of the landlord’s actions I formed
the view that proceeding with the Inquiry in the
absence of the applicant would
not disadvantage the applicant in any manner.
Want de Rowe has recently been appointed as the landlord’s agent. The
landlord was previously represented by Absolute Realty
and all actions
associated with the tenancy were initiated by this company.
evidence before the Inquiry consisted of the following materials:
documents submitted by the tenants in support of their application and kept on
the Commissioner of Tenancies file numbered RT1415-0402
documents submitted by the landlord in response and kept on the file; and
oral evidence of Ms Want de Rowe.
the basis of the documentary and oral evidence before the Inquiry, I find there
is a tenancy agreement within the meaning of and
subject to the provisions of
the Act on the following terms:
Commencement Date: 15 August
Vacate date: 12 February 2015
Rent: $ 350.00 per week payable fortnightly in advance
Security Deposit $ 1,400.00
tenancy was for a fixed term of 26 weeks, commencing on 15 August 2014. On 20
October 2014 the tenants gave notice in writing
of their intention to end the
tenancy early. This situation is commonly known as a “lease
tenancy was due to expire on 12 February 2015 and the tenants gave up vacant
possession of the premises on 22 October 2014.
premises were leased to new tenants on 11 November 2014.
security deposit of $1,400.00 was paid by the tenants at the commencement of the
tenancy, as required under the tenancy agreement.
The landlord withheld the
entire security deposit for the purposes as detailed in an RT08 Notice of
Landlord’s Intention to
retain Security Deposit issued to the tenants on
28 October 2014.
The Tenants’ application
tenants are seeking the return of $316.09 pursuant to section 113 withheld from
their security deposit by the landlord.
determining the tenants’ application there are a number of procedural
matters that need to be considered in relation to the
landlord’s retention
of a portion of the security deposit.
matters are dealt with in the proceeding paragraphs and impact upon the
tenants’ application to the extent that they go
to the heart of whether
the landlord was able to retain a portion of the security deposit under the Act
and if so, whether the landlord
acted in accordance with the requirements of the
Act to do so.
Date of termination of tenancy
Determining
the date the tenancy is effectively terminated as a result of the tenants
vacating the premises early has an impact on
the landlord’s capacity to
legally withhold a portion of the security deposit.
section 82(1)(c) of the Act if the premises are abandoned before the end of the
agreement the tenancy is terminated on and from
the date on which rent was due
and payable following the date the tenant vacated the premises.
tenants rent was paid up until 6 November 2014 and the next rent day upon which
rent was payable after the tenants vacated was
7 November 2014.
accordance with section 82(1)(c) I determine this to be the date the tenancy is
terminated.
landlord may seek compensation under the Act for rent foregone until the
property was relet (ie for the period 7 – 10 November
2014). A claim for
rent foregone is normally subject to a landlord demonstrating that they have
mitigated their loss in accordance
with section 122(3) of the Act. However as
the period in question was only four days this requirement is

invoices were attached to the Notice issued by Absolute Real Estate, one in the
amount of $155.00 for advertising costs and one
in the amount of $385.00 for a
letting fee.
an email sent to the tenants on 12 November 2014 by Absolute Real Estate, the
following reconciliation was provided in respect
of the withholding of security
deposit funds:
Bank transfer

Costs ($155.00); and
Loss of Rent
totalled $832.00 with the balance of the security deposit funds of $568.00 being
returned to the tenants.
cleaning costs were supported with an invoice and explained in a subsequent
email from Absolute Real Estate to the tenants dated
13 November 2014 in the
following terms:
“In response to your email below, in
accordance with the Tenancy Act, when tenants break their lease, tenants are
held liable
to maintain the property and mitigate the owners losses. As the
property was vacant for a few weeks and became dusty during the vacancy
surface clean was required for the new tenancy. Therefore you are responsible to
cover this expense.”
$2.00 charge is described as a bank transfer fee. No further explanation is
provided as to why this charge has been levied on
the tenants or why they have
an obligation to meet this charge.
the cleaning fee or bank transfer fee were included in the RTO8
The Legislative scheme
By section 112 of the Act, landlords have various rights and obligations in
relation to security deposits.
112(6) provides in effect that, in circumstances where a tenant abandons leased
premises, a landlord may continue to hold
part or all of the security deposit
against an amount that the landlord may recover under section 122 as
compensation for loss of
rent the tenant would otherwise have been liable to pay
and loss associated with securing new tenants for the premises.
112(8) imposes an important qualification upon the landlord’s right to
make a claim under section 122 in respect of
the losses described in section
112(6). It provides:
(8) The landlord is not entitled to claim
under section 122 part or all of the amount of the loss referred to in
subsection (6) unless:
(a) the Commissioner receives an application to determine the distribution
of the tenant's deposit; or
(b) the loss is claimed under section 122,
as soon as practicable after the loss can be calculated and in any case
within 3 months from the date on which the tenant apparently
abandoned the
s 112(8) is part of a section that is principally concerned with how security
deposits are to be dealt with, its plain operation
is to impose a three month
time limit upon section 122 compensation claims where the losses the
subject of the claim are losses described
in section 112(6) – that is
losses following abandonment. In cases where there is no application by the
tenant in respect
of the security deposit (see generally section 113) a claim
must be made under section 122 as soon as practicable and in any event
than three months from the date of abandonment.
landlord has not yet made an application for compensation for loss of rent and
loss associated with securing new tenants for the
landlord cannot claim amounts for these purposes as a matter of course and
disburse them from the security deposit. They must
make an application for
compensation to the Commissioner under section 122.
an application is one to which section 112(8) applies and the consequence of the
landlord not yet having made a claim is that
the landlord is out of time, the
tenancy having terminated on 7 November 2014.
landlord has not applied under section 141(1)(e) for an extension of the
three month period referred to in section 112(8). In
the circumstances there is
no need to decide whether section 141(1)(e) applies to section 112(8).
may be noted, however, that section 112(8) is expressed in terms that make it
arguable that it does more than merely prescribe
a period ‘within which an
application or other step is to be made or taken’ but instead makes the
right to recover the
losses referred to in section 112(6) contingent upon
action being taken ‘as soon as practicable and in any case within 3
– so that a failure to do so results in the extinguishment
of the right to take action.
alternatively, there
the discretion to extend the three month period
in s 112(8) then I am unaware of any feature of the landlord’s case
entitle them to an extension.
the landlord has no entitlement to recover losses of the nature referred to in
section 112(6) and as such an amount of $440.00
withheld from the security
deposit and detailed below, is to be returned to the tenants:
Letting Fee
Advertising
Costs ($155.00); and
Loss of Rent
contractual obligations that continue after a tenant has vacated, flies in the
face of section 82(1)(c), by which abandonment
leads to termination. It
therefore follows that as the tenancy agreement was terminated on 7 November
2014, the tenants no longer
have any obligations under the terms of the tenancy
agreement as the agreement is no longer in place.
consequences of this are that the $90.00 cleaning fee imposed upon the tenants
is illegal and this amount too must be returned
to the tenants.
there appears to be no basis upon which the $2.00 bank transfer fee can be
imposed upon the tenants. This must also be returned
to the tenants.
summary I find that the entire amount of $832.00 withheld from the security
deposit by the landlord is to be returned to the tenants
for the reasons stated
Accordingly,
I order that:
Respondent is to return to the Applicants an amount of $830.00 pursuant to
section 113 withheld from the Applicants’ security
