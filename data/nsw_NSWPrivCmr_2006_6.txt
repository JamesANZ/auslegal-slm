Disclosure of council's credit card expenditure [2006] NSWPrivCmr 6 (1 July 2006)
Disclosure of council's credit card
expenditure
regarding the disclosure of information about staff, which could
be viewed as
personal information.
Kempsey Shire Council received requests from members of the community to
release details of the credit card expenditure of officers
of the agency. The
agency responded by making public a report outlining the names of the
conferences attended, number of staff, who
attended and the cost. Initially, the
agency considered including the names of the staff members attending the
conferences, but due
to the concerns of staff members, the council did not
include the names in the draft report.
The agency sought the advice of Privacy NSW as to whether they could include
the names of staff in the publicly available report,
without the consent of
staff members. The council also sought advice from the two other legal
Kempsey Shire Council informed Privacy NSW that one source of legal advice
supported the release of the names (or at least the position
titles) of the
staff attending conferences in their capacity as public sector officials. That
legal advice viewed this approach as
being consistent with the public interest
and ensuring transparency in government decision-making.
Another source from which the Council took legal advice held the view that
disclosure of staff names would be a breach of the
Information Protection Act 1998
(PPIP Act), specifically
section 18.
in case it conflicts with the Commissioner's complaint
handling function which
requires him/her to take a neutral position in order to conciliate complaints.
For the same reason Privacy
NSW cannot adjudicate between differing legal views.
Despite this, Privacy NSW provided the council with a few general
observations.
