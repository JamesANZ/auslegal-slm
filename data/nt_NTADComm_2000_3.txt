Smith, Norma v Conchitina Ciarla [2000] NTADComm 3 (23 October 2000)
ANTI-DISCRIMINATION COMMISSION
COMPLAINANT: Norma Smith
RESPONDENT: Conchitina Ciarla
TRIBUNAL: Mr Tom Stodulka
Hearing Commissioner
ISSUE: s. 73 - Application to join party
DATE OF HEARING: 25 August 2000
DATE OF DECISION: 23 October 2000
Mrs Norma Smith lodged a complaint
alleging discrimination on the grounds of an impairment and race and failure to
accommodate a special
need in the area of work on 8 June 1999. Mrs Smith's
complaint was against her immediate supervisor, Ms Concetta Ciarla. Both Ms
Ciarla and Mrs Smith work in the laundry at Royal Darwin Hospital. They are
employees of Territory Health Services (THS).
Mrs Smith's complaint was
accepted by the Commission on 18 June 1999. A
prima facie
finding was
made on 18 February 2000. A conciliation conference was attempted and failed on
16 March 2000. The matter was referred
to Hearing on 23 March 2000.
Shortly after this, on 27 March 2000, Mrs Smith wrote to my Delegate. In
a very brief letter she requested that Territory Health Services
be joined as a
respondent to her complaint. In this letter Mrs Smith suggests that it had at
some time previously been suggested
to her to join THS as a respondent (by whom
or when is not apparent). However, she did not take up this advice as, she
states, she
was distressed and confused at the time. In this letter the
Complainant also noted that she believed that THS was already joined
Commission because of a "case with TIO" [a workers compensation claim] she was
already pursuing, which also involved THS.
This correspondence was placed on the
Hearing file. As the request was received after the complaint had been referred
to Hearing,
it could only be the Hearing Commissioner, in this case myself, that
determined the request.
The matter was listed for a Directions Hearing
on 25 August 2000. At that Hearing, the Complainant and Respondent appeared in
The Complainant was assisted by Mr Ted Milliken ( a practicing
psychologist) in the role of a support person. The respondent was
assisted by Mr
Jeff Fraser, an employee of THS, also in the role of a support person.
the Directions Hearing Mrs Smith repeated her application to join THS as a
respondent in the complaint. It was apparent at the
Hearing that neither party
was in a position to present argument to me on whether I should accept Mrs
Smith's application. I directed
that the parties should address written
submissions to me on the matter, at which time I would determine the issue and
hold a further
Directions Hearing in light of my decision.
written submissions from the Complainant on 15 September 2000. I have received
no submissions from the Respondent in relation
to this matter. I have considered
the Complainant's submissions in relation to this matter and have determined to
refuse her application.
In light of this decision it has been unnecessary for me
to seek submissions from THS in relation to the application, as no decision
adverse to their interests has been made.
The Complainant's
Submissions
In her written submissions the Complainant raised two
main points. First, she suggested that she had not originally joined THS because
she was frightened of being victimised by management, so she limited her
complaint to her immediate supervisor. She stated that it
was only after lodging
her complaint that she became aware of the provisions of the
Anti-Discrimination Act 1992
(the Act) that protect against victimisation
(section 23). Second, Mrs Smith asserts that at the time of making the complaint
was confused and distressed and unable to think clearly.
The matters
raised by the Complainant may be such as to enliven a discretion, or favour its
exercise once enlivened. However, in the
view I have taken, I do not believe
that the power to join a party to a complaint under section 73 of the Act is one
I have the discretion
to exercise at all once a complaint has been referred to
Hearing. As such her submissions do not avail her with respect to her
application
pursuant to section 73.
I should note, however, section 65,
regarding the time limits for making complaints, does create a discretion to
accept a complaint
out of time. The matters raised by the Complainant may avail
her with respect to an application to bring a new complaint against
her employer
(THS). Consideration of the merits of such an application would have to await a
decision by the Complainant to pursue
that course.
Section 73 of the Act is located within Part 6 "Resolution of
Complaints." The Part is divided into five divisions entitled sequentially:
Complaints, Investigations, Conciliation Process, Hearings and Miscellaneous.
Section 73 is located within the first division of
this part (Complaints). This
Division deals with the form, formulation, notification, acceptance, rejection
and withdrawal of complaints.
Under the scheme of the legislation, a complaint
must be accepted under the provisions of Division 1 (section 66) to have an
under the Act. A complaint must comply with the form and content
provisions in order to be accepted. Section 64 (1) (c) requires
that a complaint
"so far as practicable, specify the respondent or each respondent". Section 70
requires that a respondent be notified
as soon as practicable after a complaint
is accepted.
The following division deals with the investigation of
complaints after their acceptance. As a result of a
prima facie
after the investigation the conciliation provisions are enlivened. It is only in
light of a failed conciliation that the
Hearing provisions of Division 4 become
It is within this context that section 73 exists. Its
location in the Act indicates a sequential placement within the process for
exercise of the joining power. That power is normally to be exercised at the
time a complaint is made. If, however, the power was
exercised during the
investigation stage, in light of material that came to light during the
investigation, and the respondent so
joined was given an opportunity to
contribute information to the investigation, it could not be thought that this
would defeat the
scheme of the Act.
It is a well respected principle of
statutory interpretation that sections of an Act must be read in the context of
the Act as a whole.
As Isaacs and Rich JJ stated " ...every passage in a
document must be read not as if it were entirely divorced from its context but
as part of the whole instrument." (
Metropolitan Gas Company v The Federated
Gas Employees Industrial Union
[1925] HCA 5
(1924) 35 CLR 449
case of Anti Discrimination legislation such as the Act, the notion that the
scheme of such legislation does not just create
a statutory tort but also
creates, as a necessary precondition to the creation of the right of action, a
complete process for resolving
the dispute that gives rise to the tort has been
accepted by the High Court (
Re East ex parte guoc Phu Nguyuen
[1998] HCA 73
159 ALR 108
at 116 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ).
To adopt the
Complainant's suggestion, that the power under section 73 can be exercised at
any time, would enable the extensive provisions
of the Act regarding pre-hearing
procedures to be effectively defeated by a complainant who pursues a complaint
against a nominal
respondent to get through the conciliation procedures and then
attempts to "join the world" at the hearing procedures.
certainly not suggesting any
with regards to the complainant
in this matter, her case serves as an example of the policy basis to this view.
THS were not joined
as respondents to the complaint initially. They had no
opportunity to present their view of the circumstances giving rise to the
complaint in the investigation prior to the prima facie finding. They had no
participation in the conciliation that was attempted
as a necessary prelude to
this hearing. To allow THS to be joined at this stage would allow the
possibility of significant abuses
of the investigation, conciliation and
ultimately hearing processes upon which the Act is based.
I note also
Zarb v North Melboume Institute of TAFE
[VCAT No 294 of 1999, 29
February 2000, Unreported] Deputy President Cate McKenzie dealt with an
application to join a respondent
at hearing in similar circumstances to the
present application. Deputy President McKenzie, while noting that the Victorian
legislation
in question allowed a discretion to join a respondent, declined to
exercise that discretion. While noting the differences between
the Victorian and
the Northern Territory legislation, I believe the factors affecting Deputy
President McKenzie's refusal to exercise
her discretion support the
interpretation of section 73 of the Act encompassed in this decision.
The application to join THS is dismissed. The
matter has already been listed for a further Directions Hearing on Friday 10
at 10.00 am at which time I will issue directions for the conduct of
the hearing between the Complainant and the Respondent.
