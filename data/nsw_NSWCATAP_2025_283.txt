REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is an appeal from a decision of the Consumer and Commercial Division of the
) in matter 2025/00040649 of 5 June 2025 (
the Primary Decision, the Tribunal ordered the appellant to pay the respondent
$10,115.00 in respect of the following items:
(1) rectification costs, $9,680.00 (
(2) seal rectification, $550.00 (
(3) a window gap seal, $1,980.00 (
(4) concrete marks, $1,155.00 (
four items total of $13,365.00. However, from that amount the Tribunal deducted
“$3,250.00 owing on the contract”,
thus ordering $10,115.00 to be
paid by the appellant to the respondent.
The appellants’
Notice of Appeal
appellant says it received the Primary Decision on 6 June 2025. The appellant
then filed a Notice of Appeal on 1 July 2025, which
is within the time provided
by r 25(4)(c) of the
Civil and Administrative Tribunal Rules 2014
appellant challenges the order made by the Tribunal. The grounds of appeal are
1. The rectification cost is outside of the agreement of the
work, My Company Shouldnt liable for it. Chuling Su provided evidences
appears to lack authenticity and includes fraudulent invoices.
2. Chuling Su had an owner builder permit, this cost is
invoiced by her own company, this cost shouldn't accept by the court.
submitted invoice constitutes a sham invoice, deliberately misrepresenting the
transaction to circumvent fair market principles.
This violates Australian
commercial law requirements for authenticity, arm's-length dealings, and good
faith. And the work value
maximum $70 (1 hours for work, $50/hr and materials
only cost $20).
3. This is a daily work, I only worked for 2 days and I
received $1,000. The rest of work are not liable to me.
4. the work is completed. Engineer does not show this is an
defect, Chuling Su received the engineer certificate already. therefore,
cost is not liable to me.
5. Chuling SU should pay me back the Daily labour work. it is
outside of the contract and the total is $1,843.75
(grammatical and other errors as in original)
will refer to these five grounds of appeal respectively as Grounds One, Ground
Two, Three, Four and Five.
addition, the appellant says that the Primary Decision was not fair and
equitable, against the weight of the evidence, and that
significant new evidence
is now available that was not available at the time of the hearing.
will refer to these three grounds of appeal respectively as Grounds Six, Seven
appellant filed various bundles of documents, but these were consolidated into a
single volume filed on 24 September
bundle included documents divided into three sections, namely Sections One, Two
and Three. The bundle included some documents
that were not before the
Respondents’ documents
respondent filed a document titled Reply to Appeal on 15 July 2025
to the Reply were submissions dated 15 July 2025, a copy of the Primary
Decision, a certificate issued under
Civil and Administrative
Tribunal Act 2013
), and a 138 page bundle of
materials titled “Written submissions in opposition to the appeal”.
That document also included
a further four pages of submissions.
respondent’s documents also included documents not before the Tribunal.
Some were in response to the new materials the appellant
sought to rely on;
others related to additional costs claimed to have been incurred by the
respondent.
Preliminary matters
are two preliminary matters to deal with.
first is that, for some reason, Mr Jiadong Su was named as a respondent to the
appeal. Mr Su is actually a director of the appellant.
29 of the NCAT Rules provides that:
29 Parties to internal appeal
The parties to an internal appeal are—
(a) the appellant, and
(b) any person or body (other than the appellant) who was a party to
the proceedings before the Tribunal at first instance, and
(c) if the Attorney General or another Minister intervenes in the
proceedings under section 44 of the Act—the Attorney General
or Minister,
(d) any other person who is made a party to the proceedings by the
Tribunal under section 44 of the Act, and
(e) any other person required to be joined or treated as a party to
the proceedings by a Division Schedule for a Division of the
Tribunal, enabling
legislation or the procedural rules.
Su was not a party to proceedings 2025/00040649. No application was made that he
be joined as a party to the appeal.
those circumstances, as we explained to the parties at the appeal hearing, Mr Su
had to be removed as a respondent to the appeal.
Neither of the parties objected
to that course.
second matter concerns the documents filed by the parties for the purposes of
the appeal. The usual rule is that the evidence
before the Appeal Panel will be
limited to the evidence before the Tribunal at first instance. There is an
exception to that rule,
namely for evidence that was not reasonably available at
the time of the Tribunal hearing:
Al-Daouk v Mr Pine Pty Ltd t/as Furnco
[2015] NSWCATAP 111 (Al-Daouk)
, the Appeal Panel found that while Mrs Al-Daouk had taken a
number of steps to obtain evidence of the type she sought to rely on
appeal, the issue was whether, objectively, the evidence had arisen since the
hearing and was therefore was “not reasonably
available” at the time
of the hearing.
way of example, the appellant seeks to rely on evidence which proves that Duo
Rendering Pty Ltd (
) was deregistered on 1 August 2021. The
significance of this event was that at the Tribunal hearing the respondent
relied on invoice
numbered 24022 of Duo dated 25 November 2024 (
to found its entitlement to rectification costs of $9,680.00.
Su told us that he only became aware of the deregistration of Duo after he was
ordered by the Tribunal to pay the respondent $9,680.00
in respect of
rectification costs. He says that the invoice therefore is a sham. On the other
hand, the respondent told us that that
was the invoice she received from Duo
when it provided its services, which she accepted and paid for in good
with the usual practice of the Appeal Panel, which the evidence in this case
gives no cause to depart from, then as we
are not satisfied that the documents
sought to be relied on by either parties were not reasonably available at the
time of the Tribunal
hearing, we will have no regard to those documents as
evidence which can be relied upon before us.
any documents Ms Su wishes to rely on in relation to the costs of the appeal may
be filed in accordance with the orders have
Nature of an
sets out the basis upon which appeals from
decisions of the Tribunal may be brought. That section states that an appeal may
as of right on any question of law or with leave of the Appeal Panel on
any other grounds (s 80(2)(b)).
A question of law
Prendergast
v Western Murray Irrigation Ltd
[2014] NSWCATAP 69
, the Appeal
Panel set out a non-exhaustive list of possible questions of law giving
rise to an appeal as of right:
(1) whether there has been a failure to provide proper reasons;
(2) whether the Tribunal identified the wrong issue or asked the
wrong question;
(3) whether a wrong principle of law had been applied;
(4) whether there was a failure to afford procedural fairness;
(5) whether the Tribunal failed to take into account relevant (that
is, mandatory) considerations;
(6) whether the Tribunal took into account an
irrelevant consideration;
(7) whether there was no evidence to support a finding of fact;
(8) whether the decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker
would make it.
matters were clarified and expanded by the Appeal Panel in
Commercial Group Pty Ltd v Cusumano
[2024] NSWCATAP 204 (Unique)
where the Appeal Panel relevantly
stated at [32] (references
To the above list [referring to the list in Prendergast extracted
above] might be added the following (some of which are nuanced
of the categories in Prendergast):
(1) Whether the Tribunal drew inferences that were not
available from the facts as found (an extension of item
7 [of Prendergast])
(2) Whether the construction of a statute or
contract arrived at by the Tribunal at first instance was wrong in
some identified
(3) Whether the Tribunal’s decision was
vitiated by bias, or a reasonable apprehension of bias, relates to and
with the fair hearing rule, and may encompass or be related to
the procedural fairness question: ...
(4) Whether the Tribunal failed
to respond to substantial, clearly articulated arguments based on
established facts which may
constitute a failure to accord
natural justice, that is, procedural unfairness. Alternatively,
it may also constitute a constructive
failure to exercise
(5) Whether the facts as found necessarily
satisfied the statute or necessarily did not: ...
33 Plainly, the categories are not closed.

Panel (subject to

Leave to appeal
12 of Sch 4 of the NCAT Act provides that, in an appeal from a decision of the
Consumer and Commercial Division of the Tribunal,
an Appeal Panel may
grant leave to appeal only if satisfied that the appellant may have
suffered a substantial miscarriage of justice
(1) the decision of the Tribunal under appeal was not fair and
equitable; or
(2) the decision of the Tribunal under appeal was against the weight of
evidence; or
(3) significant new evidence has arisen (being evidence that was not reasonably
available at the time the proceedings under appeal
were being dealt with).
principles to be applied by an Appeal Panel in determining whether or
not leave to appeal should be granted are well settled.
[2014] NSWCATAP 17
the Appeal Panel conducted a
review of the relevant cases at [65]-[79] and concluded at [84](2)
Ordinarily it is appropriate to grant leave to appeal only in matters that
(a) Issues of principle;
(b) questions of public importance or matters of
administration or policy which might have general application; or
(c) an injustice which is reasonably clear, in the sense
of going beyond merely what is arguable, or an error that is plain and
apparent which is central to the Tribunal's decision and not merely
peripheral, so that it would be unjust to allow the finding
(d) a factual error that was unreasonably arrived at and
clearly mistaken; or
(e) the Tribunal having gone about the fact
finding process in such an unorthodox manner or in such a way that it was
produce an unfair result so that it would be in the interests of
justice for it to be reviewed.
if an appellant establishes that they may have suffered a
substantial miscarriage of justice in the sense explained above, the
Panel retains a discretion whether to grant leave under s 80(2)
of the Act. An appellant must demonstrate something more than
that the Tribunal was arguably wrong:
[2014] NSWCATAP 78
The Primary
considering the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to briefly summarise the
structure and content of the Primary Decision.
[1]-[3], the Tribunal considers the question of whether it had jurisdiction to
hear and determine the matter, The Tribunal found
that it did.
[4]-[8], the Tribunal sets out the “Background” to the matter,
noting at [4] that the parties agreed sometime in April
2024 that the respondent
would carry out some building work, namely “(laying a slab and excavation,
erecting timber framing
wall and roof, and termite barries installation –
together the Original Scope of Works) for $47,000”. The Tribunal also
noted at [4] that all but $3,250.00 had been paid by the respondent to the
appellant. At [5], the Tribunal noted that further works
and variations were
agreed and implemented between the parties “along the way”, but
these were not the “direct
subject” of the proceedings.
[6] the Tribunal noted that there was no written formal contract between the
parties, “although most of the material terms
were agreed through Wechat
between the parties, of which records have been provided by the
[9], the Tribunal sets out what it describes as the relevant legal principles,
setting out ss 18B(1) and (2) and
-(4) of the
[10]-[12], the Tribunal summarises the issues in dispute between the parties,
noting at [10] that the respondent was seeking compensation
for rectification
works carried out, together with compensation for lost rental income, legal fees
and other out of pocket costs,
for a total of $35,489.00, which amount was
reduced to $29,489.00 during the course of the hearing.
[13]-[24] the Tribunal summarised the material before it which included the
“extensive bundles of documents” provided
by the parties, and some
of the oral evidence given by Mr Su on behalf of the appellant and the
respondent.
[25]-[36] the Tribunal sets out the alleged defects, noting that the respondent
had obtained a building defect report prepared
by Seido Construction Pty Ltd
Seido Report
Relevantly:
(1) at [26], the Tribunal stated that Seido noted that the concrete upturn wall
had embedded timber, which had been inadequately
installed, and would not be
waterproof and could potentially cause the concrete to crack. Seido offered four
possible solutions,
and the respondent elected to implement the fourth, which
was to waterproof and render the wall;
(2) at [28], the Tribunal stated that, with regard to this defect, the appellant
acknowledged that this was a defect requiring rectification,
but that the
appellant submitted it had never agreed to do rendering as part of the Original
Scope of Works. (We note that the appellant
repeated that submission at the
appeal hearing);
(3) at [30], the Tribunal stated that the Seido Report noted that a pvc pipe
installed by the appellant was unsealed, which could
enable water to penetrate
the concrete slab and wall. Seido offered four possible solutions, and the
respondent elected to implement
the third, which was to seal off the
penetration. The respondent engaged the services of her own interior decorating
company for
this service at a cost of $550.00;
(4) at [33], the Tribunal states that the respondent stated that concrete marks
made by the appellant’s sub-contractor had
stained her front retaining
wall, and that she had obtained a quote for $1,155 to rectify these marks;
(5) at [35], the Tribunal states that the Seido Report noted a gap between
the window frame and the steel lintel above caused water
ingress concerns. Seido
offered two possible solutions, and the respondent obtained a quotation of
$1,980 to rectify this issue;
(6) at [36], in possible contradiction to the Tribunal’s statement at [5]
that further works and variations were agreed and
implemented between the
parties “along the way”, but these were not the “direct
subject” of the proceedings,
the Tribunal states that “the
[appellant] noted that the window installation was not part of the Original
Scope of Works but
did acknowledge that this was part of a variation added
subsequently”. The Tribunal then notes that this work was paid for
respondent, with the appellant not explaining its failure to rectify the gap.
[37]-[42], the Tribunal sets out the claims for lost rental income and delay
damages. At [45]-[47], the Tribunal sets out the claim
in respect of
“pipe/plumbing job”. Similarly, at [48]-[52], the Tribunal
summarises “additional claims”.
all these additional claims were dismissed it is not necessary to summarise them
in these reasons.
[53]-[61], the Tribunal sets out its “Findings and reasons for
decision”. The Tribunal relevantly finds:
(1) at [54], that:
With regard to the arrangements between the parties, I find that the [appellant]
did contract with the [respondent] to provide the
Original Scope of Works for a
fixed price, no hidden costs or additional labour or material charges. The
[respondent] continues to
owe $3,250 to the [appellant] under that contract, and
that amount should therefore be applied to the rectification costs awarded
(2) at [59], that:
With regard to the [respondent’s] claim for rectification costs of $9,680
paid to Duo Rendering Pty Ltd, to rectify some of
the defects, I find that these
defects relate to the residential building works undertaken by the [appellant],
and have been acknowledged
by the [appellant]. The [appellant] elected not to
rectify the defects, and therefore liability for the cost of rectification is
attributable to the Respondent accordingly.
(3) at [60], that:
With regard to the [respondent’s] claim for rectification costs of $550
paid to W & M Construction Project Pty Ltd to rectify
the seal, I find that
this defect relates to the residential building works undertaken by the
[appellant], and has been acknowledged
by the [appellant]. The [appellant]
elected not to rectify the defects, and therefore liability for the cost of
rectification is
attributable to the [appellant] accordingly].
(4) at [61], that:
With regard to the [respondent’s] claim for rectification costs of $10,010
quoted by Built & Co Pty Ltd, to rectify some
of the defects, I find that
the window gap seal ($1,980) and the removal of concrete marks ($1,155) are
defects which are attributable
to the [appellant], which he [sic – it]
either refused to rectify or rectified inadequately, and therefore liability for
cost of rectification is attributable to the [appellant] accordingly.
Consideration
One is set out above.
consists of two limbs.
first is that the rectification costs were “outside of the agreement of
is not clear whether the appellant is referring to Item 1 alone (being
rectification costs of $9,680.00) or more generally to all
the Items the subject
of the Tribunal’s order, in particular Item 2 (being seal
rectification).
way, there is some substance to this point. The issue here is that the Tribunal
failed to make clear findings as to the terms
of the contract between the
parties, in particular what was the scope of works agreed to the parties. The
Tribunal did note in its
“Background” section, by way of
introduction, that the parties agreed sometime in April 2024 that the respondent
carry out some building work, namely “laying a slab and excavation,
erecting timber framing wall and roof, and termite barries
installation –
together the Original Scope of Works for $47,000”.
even if we accepted that that was a statement of relevant findings of the scope
of works, the Tribunal goes on later to find
at [36] that the window
installation (the subject of Item 3) was not part of the Original Scope of
Works, but the appellant should
compensate the respondent $1,980.00 in respect
of the “window gap seal”.
Nevertheless,
the fact is that here are no clear findings on what was the scope of works the
subject of the contract between the parties,
save for the statement at [4] of
the Primary Decision. We discussed this issue with the parties at the hearing.
In particular, we
asked them how Items 2, 3 and 4 arose as a breach of the
contract. No satisfactory answer to this question was given.
relation to Items 2 and 4, we fail to see how the costs of rectifying a seal,
the window gap seal and concrete marks, can relate
to any of “laying a
slab and excavation, erecting timber framing wall and roof, and termite barrier
installation”.
any event, Item 4 appears to have been a claim for consequential damage caused
by the appellant. We only know that as that was
what we were told at the appeal
hearing. That fact cannot be gleaned by the text of the Primary Decision. And
there was no sound
recording of transcript of the hearing before us.
appears therefore that, while perhaps Item (4) may have been “directly
attributable to the [appellant]”, it was not
a defect (Primary Decision at
to Item 1, compensation for Item 1 is the largest amount allowed for. The
Tribunal’s findings in relation to this item
are set out at [59] of the
Primary Decision.
Seido Report relevantly states:
CONCRETE UPTURN WALL
Timbers have been spotted embedded into concrete turnup wall after formwork has
been removed as per the following photo shows. It
is believed that timbers used
as formwork support have been inadequately installed and result they became
impossible to remove when
concrete was poured around it.
[photos and diagram]
1. Timber could span and rot when contact with moisture
particularly as H2 treated pine and over time it could cause the surrounding
concrete to crack
2. Similar to basement or other underground external wall,
this concrete upturn wall has been designed as retaining wall which
the external
face will be in contract with natural ground at all time. Proper waterproofing
is required to stop moisture/water to
penetrate into interior space however it
is impossible to apply waterproofing due to the embedded timber.
Suggestion:
1. Completely remove the embedded timber off from concrete
2. Roughen and etch the concrete surface around the opening
after timber has been properly removed
3. Apply concrete repair mortar such SikaQuick-2500AU Repair
mortar to seal up all penetration. Install steel anchor as per instruction
applicable.
4. Apply waterproofing to external face of upturn wall and
apply render or other interior finish to the internal face.
Duo invoice states that the invoice is in respect of “colour texture for
external walls of house”. In our view, “colour
texture” should
be understood as rendering. However, suggestion (or solution) number 4 includes
mention about waterproofing
of the external wall. Waterproofing and rendering
are not the same processes.
discussed this with the respondent, who said that the expert opinion
“[a]pply waterproofing to external face of upturn wall
and apply render or
other interior finish to the internal face” should be understood as
meaning “[a]pply waterproofing
to external face of upturn wall and apply
render” to the external wall.
disagree. We consider that the meaning of the expert’s fourth solution is
to apply waterproofing to external face of the
upturn wall,
render or [an]other interior finish to the internal face. In our view, the
conjunctive “and” suggests that the
expert’s solution was two
fold, namely to apply waterproofing to external face of the upturn wall, and to
apply render or [an]other
interior finish to the internal face.
Tribunal stated at [26] of the Primary Decision, in describing the alleged
defects, that “the [respondent] elected to implement
[suggestion of Seido], which was to waterproof and render the wall”
(emphasis added). That was what the Tribunal
said that the Seido Report stated.
We disagree. We consider that the Tribunal misunderstood what the Seido Report
regardless of that, the Tribunal did not state in its “Finding and
reasons” why the $9,680.00 paid to Duo, which the
Tribunal ordered the
appellant to reimburse to the respondent, related to defects in the work
undertaken by the appellant, save for
what the Tribunal stated at [59] of the
Primary Decision.
our view, the Tribunal’s reasons are inadequate.
relevant principles relating to adequacy of reasons of the Tribunal were stated
by the Court of Appeal in
NSW Land and Housing Corporation v
[2019] NSWCA 231
, by Bell P (as the Chief Justice of NSW then was),
with whom Ward JA (as the President of the Court of Appeal then was) agreed.
, the Court of Appeal stated at [71] that:
... there are certain minimum characteristics that a Tribunal’s reasons
must possess. These are really supplied, in relation
to the Tribunal, by s 62(3)
of the [Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 (NSW)] which ... requires
there to be set out in reasons
(when requested by a party):
(a) the findings on material
questions of fact, referring to the evidence or other material on which those
findings were based,
(b) the Tribunal's understanding of the
applicable law, and
(c) the reasoning processes that lead
the Tribunal to the conclusions it made.
(emphasis added)
principles have been followed and applied many times by the Appeal Panel,
including most recently on 10 October 2025 in
Tiglin Constructions Pty Ltd v
[2025] NSWCATAP 251
Appeal Panel stated at [72] that the reasoning need not be unduly long or
elaborate, but needs to be sufficient to explain why
a decision was made.
a majority of the Court of Appeal (Bell CJ and Kirk JA) stated in
Della Bruna
v Health Care Complaints Commission
[2025] NSWCA 105
it was certainly a legal error by failure to give adequate,
intelligible or logical reasons ... It was also a constructive
to exercise jurisdiction insofar as it involved a failure to grapple
with a substantial and clearly articulated aspect of the appellant’s
case ... That type of error can also be expressed in terms of procedural
fairness (as raised by ground 5(b)):
Dranichnikov v Minister for
Immigration and Multicultural Affairs
[2003] HCA 26
(2003) 77 ALJR
our view, a similar finding should be made in respect of the Primary
Decision’s finding with respect to Items 2, 3 and 4.
The Primary Decision
does not explain why Items 2, 3 and 4 fell within the scope of works agreed by
the appellant and the respondent.
summary, we consider that the appellant has raised a question of law, and that
the appellant has established an error on a question
of law. In this respect,
see the recent decision of the Appeal Panel
SD Portfolio Holdings Pty Ltd v
[2025] NSWCATAP 280.
follows that the appeal must be allowed and the order of the Tribunal set
appellant also claimed that the respondent should pay him $1,843.75 in respect
of “the Daily labour work” which he
said was “outside of the
note that the Tribunal allowed “$3,250.00 owing on the contract”, in
circumstances where no cross-application had been
filed by the appellant.
Perhaps the amount was allowed by way of set-off, but if this was the case, this
was not explained in the
reasons for decision.
any event, there is no basis for the Appeal Panel to order the respondent to pay
the appellant the $1,843.75 as claimed.
The next steps
determined that the order made as part of the Primary Decision should be set
aside, the question arises whether the issues
should be remitted to the
Tribunal, or reconsidered by us.
we have no transcript of the hearing, we do not consider that we can reconsider
the matter. It will need to be reconsidered by
the Tribunal differently

amount involved in the appeal $10,115.00 is a modest one, given that the
in relation to
residential building disputes is $500,000.00. We encourage the parties to
resolve this matter consensually, bearing
in mind that the outcome of a further
hearing is unknown and each run the risk that they will be in a
worse position than they are
