APC UPDATE | 10 October 2014
Summary of latest adjudications
Complainant / The Daily Telegraph
The Press Council has considered complaints about a photograph in The Daily
Telegraph on 27 May 2014. The photograph occupied much
of the front page,
showing a body-sized shape wrapped in a tarpaulin and floating in the ocean. A
foot in a shoe could be seen protruding
from the tarpaulin. It was later
confirmed that the body was that of student whom police believed had been
murdered a week earlier
in relation to a drug deal.
The Council considered that, especially by showing the foot, the photograph
was likely to cause great offence to a significant number
of people, including
those who merely saw it on a newsstand. Also, a substantial number of people who
saw it are likely to have known
the student.
On the other hand, the Council considered that powerful exposure in this way
of the risks of involvement in drug deals can be of substantial
importance in
the public interest. This effect would have been less powerful if the foot had
not been shown to establish that the
bag contained a body.
The Council’s principal concern was that the photograph was shown on
the front page and was very large. Placing it on a very
prominent inner page,
with a clear warning on the front page, could have greatly reduced the risk of
offence while not greatly reducing
its effectiveness as a warning of the drug
trade’s dangers.
On balance, however, the Council concluded that publishing the photograph did
not breach its Standards, even though it was very prominent
on the front page.
This is mainly because there was a very strong justification in the public
interest and also because the foot
was not shown in graphic detail. Accordingly,
the Council concluded that its Standards of Practice were not breached.

Complainant / The Herald Sun
The Press Council has upheld a complaint about an article, “Murder sex
tape link – Fresh look at killing of mother and
daughter”, in the
print edition of the Herald Sun on 20 March 2013, relating to unsolved murders
more than 25 years earlier.
The article said the tape showed the mother with a
man whose wife later discovered it and confronted the mother. The article
several other statements tending to suggest the wife arranged the
murder of the mother and daughter.
The Council concluded that the newspaper did not take reasonable steps to
ensure these statements were accurate and fair, especially
as they were
presented as being established facts, not allegations. It acknowledged the
newspaper said the statements were based
on highly credible sources, but said
she should have been given an opportunity to comment on them before publication,
particular circumstances there was no credible risk of hindering
police investigations by doing so.
The Council also concluded that the wife’s privacy had been breached
because, although not named, she was likely to be identifiable
to some people.
It recognised that breaches of privacy in reports of “cold cases”
could sometimes be justifiable in the
public interest, but that in this
particular case there was no sufficient justification.

Some remedies without adjudication
Recent examples of the Council helping to obtain a
remedy without referral to adjudication
A complaint about a report concerning a local program for domestic violence
offenders. The complainant said that the article had misleadingly
reported the
occupational backgrounds of offenders in the program as if they were likely to
be representative of offenders in general,
and that a misleading and unfair term
had been used to describe offenders.
Council staff worked with the complainant and the newspaper to arrange
publication of a letter by the complainant explaining these
concerns. The letter
was published promptly and prominently on the newspaper’s letters
A complaint from an association of health professionals about a prominent
magazine’s medical advice column which had said it
was dangerous to
continue smoking while also using nicotine alternatives. The complainant said
that this advice was not supported
by evidence and that the publication failed
to correct it despite numerous requests to do so
The magazine stood by the accuracy of the advice but after an approach by the
Council’s staff it published a substantial article
alternatives, including prominent quotation of the complainant’s
Chair's address to the National Press Club
The Chair of the Australian Press Council, Professor Julian Disney AO, has
been invited to address the National Press Club in Canberra
on 5 November 2014.
Professor Disney, who has been Chair since 2009, will use the occasion to review
the challenges and opportunities
concerning standards of practice in print and
online media, especially in relation to the impact of the Internet.
