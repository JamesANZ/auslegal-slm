The landlord is responsible for demonstrating that one

Reasons for Decision
As a delegate
of the Commissioner, I have reviewed all evidence. Only the evidence relevant to
deciding this application is mentioned
in these reasons for decision.
Are the premises unsuitable for keeping the requested pet?
premises is a dual occupancy property; a single residential building split into
two separate units separated by an internal dividing
wall. The rear gardens have
a dividing fence between them.
In written submissions to Consumer
Protection, the landlord stated the premises are unsuitable for the requested
pet because there
are no side or front gates, and the requested pet could escape
from the rear yard and possibly cause nuisance, damage, and harm to
The tenant provided photos of the premises to Consumer
Protection. The photos show there is an outdoor side path which runs along
side of the premises from the front carport into the back yard. There is no side
gate affixed to the perimeter fence and side
wall of the premises. The tenant
has placed a large decorative iron wall art screen to block the side path. The
decorative iron screen
is [redacted] [redacted]. The tenant submits that the
decorative iron screen will be used to prevent the requested pet from escaping
the premises.
The decorative iron screen is not affixed to the premises.
The decorative iron screen is partially leaning on a brick wall, and there
small pot plant and large stones which are propping the decorative iron screen
upright. If the decorative iron screen was pushed
or moved, it would likely
create a space for the requested pet to fit through.
In determining if
the premises are unsuitable for a requested pet, the breed, age and size of the
requested pet may be considered.
The tenant advised they will be looking to
rehome a small breed dog but have not specified the breed (this is dependent on
availability).
Some small dogs (for example, a Papillon or Toy Poodle) could
squeeze through the rectangles in the decorative iron screen.
landlord also raised concerns that the premises is unsuitable because it is a
dual occupancy property. The landlord advised Consumer
Protection that the
internal shared laundry door is not soundproof, and keeping the requested pet
could impact on the adjoining tenant’s
right to quiet enjoyment. This
evidence was not a relevant consideration for this ground. The RTA provides
examples of why a premises
may be unsuitable, such as lack of fencing and open
Given that the decorative iron screen is not affixed to the
premises, and there are holes throughout the screen that a small dog could
through, I am satisfied the premises are unsuitable for keeping the requested
As the landlord has established the above ground, it is not
necessary to discuss the other three grounds in these reasons for
A tenant or landlord who is dissatisfied with
this decision can appeal to the Magistrates Court of Western Australia. Appeals
