Introduction
have before me applications filed by the parties seeking orders for voir dire
hearings of evidence.
to my lengthy delay in ruling on them and in the interests of getting this
hearing back on track, I intend only to give relatively
brief reasons for my
Defendant’s application
simply, the defendant seeks to have the evidence of witnesses being called by
the informant, namely Jason Collins and Peter Sparrow,
taken on a voir dire, in
anticipation that there will be a claim for privilege against self-incrimination
in the case of Mr Collins
and in any event objection taken to the evidence being
received. It seems any such objections may require substantial argument which
would significantly impact on the trial timetable and would most conveniently be
taken outside the usual hearing timetable.
evidence of the conduct of Mr Sparrow may itself impact on the admissibility of
the evidence of Mr Collins. Mr Collins in turn
is likely to appear with the
support of his own legal counsel.
quarantining the evidence in this way, debate and ruling on objections can be
dealt with at a later date without adversely impacting
the continuation of the
balance of the trial.
Court’s power to direct a voir dire is a matter of discretion, however
there must be a proper and adequate reason for doing
indicated, there are obvious benefits in taking the evidence of these two
witnesses in this way. There do not appear to be any
significant disadvantages
or prejudice to the informant in so doing. Accordingly, I direct that the
evidence of Mr Collins and Mr
Sparrow be taken on a voir
Informant’s application
informant seeks the following directions:
Pursuant to rule 39.1(1)
Joint Criminal Rules 2022
(SA), the Informant seeks that the
following question be determined prior to the resumption of the evidence in
these proceedings:
Is the state of mind of Mr Robert Langella:
(i) as at 17 May 2021, immediately prior to him being struck and run over by a
reversing vehicle as seen in the CCTV footage contained
at exhibits P21 and P45;
(ii) as it might be shown and inferred from his demeanour, conduct and the other
matters set out in the defendant’s notice
of intention to adduce expert
evidence, at [1] to [12], dated and filed 21 February 2024;
relevant to the proof or disproof of the elements of the charge contained on
the Information.
is a clear difference between the parties as to the legal elements of the charge
as laid. That issue has been flagged during
the course of the trial to
its opening, the informant stated:
...the duties are to a
considerable extent designed to protect employees and employees of contractors
from the consequence of their
own inattention, carelessness and sometimes
foolishness. To the extent that a defendant suggests a cause of an incident such
involving Mr Langella, even if a defendant could establish a cause,
it is irrelevant. That is so because it cannot logically address
the risk which
is the focus of the offence and the quote there, appearing at paragraph 16, is
Hanel v Cleanaway
and the judgment of Kourakis CJ, and the measures
to minimise that risk which are to be assessed respectively.
That’s particularly so here where the risk is posed to a class of
workers, including Mr Langella, the decision-making process
or state of mind of
a worker exposed to a risk is not germane to proof or disproof of the elements
of the offence.
The informant may also call members of Mr Langella’s family to give
evidence as to his activities, behaviour and state of mind
in the weeks prior to
and the morning of the incident.
I explained that these witnesses are not on the informant’s file trial
plan. They are relevant only to the extent to which the
defendant intends and is
permitted to adduce evidence which forms assumptions for an opinion, based on
facts about those matters,
and the expert opinion itself, about which the
informant was first told last week on Wednesday, 29 November 2023. At that
informant was informed that the defence proposed to rely on expert
evidence disclosed on that day.
Now, the informant’s case is that these matters – this issue of
state of mind or otherwise – are irrelevant and,
accordingly,
inadmissible. But, if the Court were to take a different view on that argument,
then the prosecution will need to call
members of Mr Langella’s family and
will need to do so as part of its case to address that foreshadowed defence
contrast, the defendant submits that the Informant’s
submission:
ignores the well settled jurisprudence that the conduct
charged under
section 19 and section 32 of the WHS Act is the
(as particularised) to an identifiable risk of death or serious injury or
illness, that arises from work conducted in a
business or undertaking, and as a
result of a failure to take reasonably practicable measures to eliminate or
minimise that risk:
for example:
Consulting Engineers Pty Ltd v SafeWork NSW
[2021] NSWCCA 288
issue first arose in the course of evidence during the cross-examination of
B/Sgt Brown. The defendant sought to cross-examine
the witness on the topic of
the fault of Mr Langella being the cause of his death.
was taken to the topic by the Informant on a number of grounds,
This is a work health and safety trial where the issue in
the trial is the question of risk, and the question is did, for the purposes
the workplace, Inghams take all reasonably practical measures by reference to
two matters, to address a risk to health and safety.
Your Honour has heard in my opening that for the purposes of these matters it
is irrelevant for the purposes of these matters to identify
the cause of an
incident. So this is the first part of my objection. That is because we know
from intermediate Court of Appeal
authority which I have cited and referred to
in the opening, that the question of the cause of an incident or who might be
be causally responsible and for what purpose, because of course one asks
the question, "Well, who is proximately responsible?" Is
it Mr Langella? Is it
Mr Collins? Is it Inghams? It depends on the purpose for which you're asking
the question.
The question, and the only question that this Court answers is whether or not
there was a risk to health and safety, and then whether
or not the defendant
took all reasonable and practical steps with respect to
overruled the objection. At such an early stage of the trial, I was not prepared
to restrict the defendant until relevance was clearer.
a subsequent interchange with the informant, I said:
understood, Mr Jacobi, that it's an objection to the topic generally, rather
than to the question specifically, and that by
not standing up and objecting
every time, I don't take it that you concede the relevance or the
admissibility.
this basis, questions of subsequent witnesses on this issue went without further
formal challenge.
view the informant’s present application as seeking to obtain a formal
conclusive ruling on relevance and admissibility of
such evidence.
I can readily see how a determination of this question may assist with the
length of the balance of the trial, conceptually
I do not consider a declaration
can be made on evidence not yet adduced. Further, it is inappropriate for the
Court to offer its
imprimatur to a decision by the prosecution to call or not to
call witnesses.
informant’s application is refused. However, no doubt this issue will
arise again during the course of further evidence.
Should it do so, and the
Informant wish to maintain its objection, then notwithstanding my previous
ruling in the evidence of B/Sgt
Brown, I invite the Informant to renew its
objection. Should it do so, I foreshadow the possibility that I may admit the
de bene esse
so as not to disrupt
the evidence but list the objection for argument. Subject to my ruling on any
such objection, it is then for
the Informant to determine the witnesses it calls
in light of that ruling.
Further directions sought by the
its application, the informant also seeks directions as to what material may be
provided to Mr Collins in preparation for his evidence.
A schedule of such
proposed material has been provided. The defendant neither consents to, nor
opposes, this application.
general rule is that a witness is not entitled to hear evidence adduced before
their evidence, so that their evidence will not
be affected by outside material.
However, Mr Collins seeks access to such material, so as to assist in his
decision of whether to
claim privilege against self-incrimination in relation to
the questions likely to be put to him in giving evidence.
the course of oral submissions, the defendant indicated it did not object to the
material included in the schedule being made
available to Mr Collins. However,
the informant during submissions also indicated a wish to provide bodycam
footage taken at the
scene. Its relevance is that it reveals the outcome of an
alcotest conducted on Mr Collins which will inform his decision on whether
claim privilege. The defendant objected to that material being provided to Mr
Collins as it has not yet gone into evidence.
relevance of the footage is obvious. I allow Mr Collins to be provided with the
material in the schedule, together with the bodycam
will schedule a directions hearing at a date convenient to counsel to fix
further dates to give effect to the directions and rulings
