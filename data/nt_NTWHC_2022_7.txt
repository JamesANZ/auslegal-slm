REASONS FOR DECISION
(Delivered 22 August 2022)
ACTING JUDGE O’LOUGHLIN
Introduction
matter substantially resolved in June 2022 when the Employer consented to orders
for the payment of past and ongoing compensation.
The Employer also agreed to
paying interest under
(“the Act”).
only issues remaining in dispute was the Worker's claim that costs be assessed
on an indemnity basis, and for an award of interest
section 109
August 2020, the Employer accepted the Worker's claim in respect of a back
February 2021, the Employer purported to cancel the payment of benefits by
writing a letter stating in part:
that the Worker
had "provided deliberately misleading information"; and
suggesting she
had obtained compensation by "fraud or other unlawful means".
an Employer cancels weekly benefits by following
subsection 69(1)
of the Act,
i.e. giving 14 days’ notice and providing an explanation as to why
benefits have been cancelled.
subsection 69(2)(c)
states that these requirements do not apply if the payments
of compensation "were obtained by fraud of the person receiving them
or by other
unlawful means". The Employer’s letter alleged fraud and chose to rely on
this subsection and the Employer did
not issue a notice.
Worker issued proceedings to challenge this cancellation, and alleged the
Employer ought to have complied with
section 69.
this the Employer pleaded the cancellation was valid relying on
section 69(2)(c)
and referring to
section 92:
"The Employer:... says that the Worker was not entitled to compensation
pursuant to
section 92(1)
section 92(2)
of the Act."
provision creates an offence if a person makes a statement or provides a
document to an Employer knowing that the statement or
document contains
misleading information.
Employer did not expressly allege fraud or other unlawful means but it is
reasonably clear that this was the effect of the pleading.
No particulars of the
fraud were pleaded in the Employer's first defence.
Banque Commerciale v Akhil Holdings
[1990] HCA 11
(1990) 169 CLR 279
at 285 Mason CJ
and Gaudron J stated that fraud may take a variety of forms which is why
fraud must be pleaded specifically and with particularity
". This was
applied by Mildren J in
Shorrlong Pty Ltd v Northern Territory Housing
[1999] NTSC 140
this case the Employer did neither as it only pleaded fraud obliquely and
without any particularity.
Worker made a strike out application, where the Judicial Registrar (rightly)
criticised the Employer's first attempt at pleading
fraud and ordered
particulars to be provided. The Judicial Registrar agreed with the submission by
the Worker that the pleading was
embarrassing and contained ambiguous
assertions.
Unfortunately
the Employer's second attempt at pleading the particulars of fraud was also
insufficient. That pleading again failed
to mention fraud, and again only
implies fraud by pleading reference to
of the Act.
Furthermore,
the particulars of this implied pleading were insufficiently
Worker in providing information leading to the document set out in this
paragraph made those documents misleading statements
to the Employer and/or its
insurer... And relies on those documents identified and to totality (sic) of the
evidence in that regard".
documents that contain misleading information are principally but not limited
[lists three documents without page or line
references]
in reporting symptoms to her treating medical practitioners ....
intentionally made statements and/or provided documents that contained
misleading information".
statements of documents did not disclose the
true extent of her symptoms
daily activities and capacity as shown on objective surveillance evidence
without limitation that the Worker reported
[lists nine
symptoms]”.
amended pleading fails to particularise which of the information was misleading,
implies but fails to allege that the Worker knew
the information was misleading,
did not plead the true extent of the Worker’s symptoms, and, by using the
phrases "more generally"
and "including", failed to properly plead all the
particulars to be relied upon.
Worker rightly criticised the amended pleading as being insufficient and flagged
a further strike out application.
response, the Employer said it was "not instructed to file any further
particulars or a further amended defence", however in the
same letter offered to
reinstate weekly benefits to the Worker.
after the Employer capitulated and resumed making weekly payments to the
summary, the Employer implied fraud on the part of the Worker, failed to
properly plead fraud even on its second attempt, and then
abandoned the case
entirely when given notice of a further strike out application.
Unfortunately
the Court has no further evidence to evaluate the strength of the Employer's
case. Clearly the Employer had surveillance
evidence which at least caused the
Employer to believe the symptoms were inconsistent with symptoms described by
the Worker. Those
reports describing the Worker’s claimed symptoms, and
the video surveillance evidence, were not put before the Court in this
application costs and interest.
the only means to determine the merit of the Employer's case is the fact that
the Employer abandoned its case after the Worker
criticised the second attempt
at pleading fraud.
is unlike the case of
BAE Systems Australia v Rothwell
[2013] NTCA 3
(2013) 275 FLR 244
where the Court of Appeal had the advantage of seeing the medical reports and
other evidence, which thereby allowed the Court to
conclude that the Employer's
case lack merit.
the Employer had difficulty pleading its fraud case, one can probably assume it
would have difficulty in proving it. If the Employer
failed to prove fraud, it
would have faced an inevitable order to pay arrears as it had not issued a
notice under
of the Act and had not pleaded a
counterclaim.
Interest under
section 109
provides for an award of interest on any late payments of weekly benefits.
This interest does not require an order of the Court and
is paid at the Supreme
Court judgment debt interest rate (the Reserve Bank of Australia cash rate plus
6%). The Employer has rightly
consented to
of the Act allows for an award of additional interest in certain
circumstances, where subsection (1) provides that if the Employer
unreasonable delay in paying compensation, the Court must order interest on the
award of compensation at a rate specified
by the Court.
my findings in the Background above, I have concluded that the Employer’s
conduct in the running of the proceeding in
the way it did, caused unreasonable
delay given that:
The Employer
initially failed to plead any particulars of fraud;
The subsequent
attempt to plead particulars was unsatisfactory;
pleading of fraud was obtuse and only by implication; and
When it was
pressed again to properly plead particulars, it completely abandoned its
I do not have all the evidence to assess the merits of the Employer's case, the
above is sufficient for me to conclude that
the Employer caused an unreasonable
delay in paying compensation to the Worker.
therefore order interest pursuant to
section 109
to the rate of interest, there have been a number of cases applying different
interest rates ranging between 6.1% in
Lajevardi v Performance Services
[2021] NTLC 31
Stevens v Serco
[2015] NTMC 27.
The interest
rate is at the discretion of the Court and presumably should vary to reflect the
behaviour of the Employer and other
relevant matters. In this case, I find the
Employer's behaviour was unsatisfactory but not especially so. I am content to
the current
interest rate of 6.85% as the additional
interest under
section 109(1).
allows for additional interest if the Employer has not made weekly
payments in a regular manner or in accordance with the normal
manner of payment.
This subsection does not have any application to the current
allows the Court to order punitive damages in addition to any interest
ordered under
subsection 109
(1) or (2). I do not find that the Employer's
conduct warrants an award under this subsection in that it was not
contumelious
high-handed
, or otherwise
sufficient to warrant this additional sanction.
BAE Systems Australia v Rothwell
[2013] NTCA 3
(2013) 275 FLR 244
Riley CJ dealt with the
issue of indemnity costs in the context of a Work Health hearing. At paragraph
[26], His Honour referred
to the decision of
Colgate-Palmolive Company v
Cussons Pty Ltd
[1993] FCA 536
(1993) 46 FCR 225
and stated:
Indemnity costs may be awarded in a variety of circumstances, and the
categories in which such orders may be made are not closed or
rigid. Examples of
circumstances where costs may be ordered on an indemnity basis include where a
party has pursued a matter which,
on proper consideration, should have been seen
to be a hopeless case and where there was undue prolongation of a case by
contentions.
that matter, the Court of Appeal had the advantage of examining all of the
evidence available to the Employer such that it could
clearly determine whether
or not the case was hopeless or groundless.
cited an authority supporting an appropriate award of indemnity costs where
there was an allegation of fraud knowing it to be false.
There is nothing to
suggest this was the case here.
the Employer abandoned its case at the time that it was being (reasonably)
pressed to properly plead that case, I find that
the evidence is insufficient to
allow the Court to conclude that the case was hopeless or groundless to warrant
an award of indemnity
addition to interest under
of the Act, the Employer is also to pay
interest under
section 109(1)
at the rate of 6.85%.
costs of the proceeding are to be taxed on the standard
