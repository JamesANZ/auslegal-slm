Apec Privcy Framework Completed: No Threat To Privacy Standards
APEC Privcy Framework completed: No threat to privacy

The APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) Privacy Framework has been
completed at meetings following the second Implementation
Seminar, held in
Kyongju, South Korea on 7-8 September 2005 (see
PL&B International
Jan/Feb 2005 and June/July 2005 for background).
The original (Nov 2004) version of the Framework had little to say concerning
the transfer of personal information between APEC economies
(or to non-APEC
of the Framework concerning these
matters was not complete and would be
addressed in future work of the ECSG Privacy Sub Group’. From that time
until now, it
seemed possible that the Framework (via Part IV (B)) might seek to
discourage or prevent data export limitations in regional privacy
attempt to provide guarantees of free flow of personal data within APEC despite
such limitations.
However, such concerns have not been borne out. The Second APEC
Implementation Seminar was held in Kyongju, Korea, in early September
followed by Privacy Sub-Group discussions concerning the missing Part IV(B)
which recommended a final version to the ECSG (E-commerce
Steering Group), which
was then forwarded to higher APEC authorities for formal endorsement. This final
(September 2005) version
of Part (IV) B of the Framework says nothing directly
requirements to allow them. Part B III. ‘Cooperative
Development of
Cross-border privacy rules’ only deals with ‘recognition or
acceptance of organizations’ cross-border privacy rules
across the APEC
region’ (APEC Framework Part B, 2005). The full text is available at
http://www.cpsr-peru.org/privacidad/apec/framework.
As a result, the APEC Framework does
do any of the following:
(i) Forbid data exports to countries without APEC-compliant laws (contrast
the EU Directive);
(ii) Explicitly allow restrictions on data exports to countries without
APEC-compliant laws (contrast the OECD Guidelines and the
Council of Europe
Convention);
(iii) Require data exports to be allowed to countries that have
APEC-compliant laws (or equivalent protections) (contrast any other
international privacy agreement).
The APEC Privacy Framework is therefore extremely non-prescriptive in
relation to data exports, consistent with its general non-prescriptive
This rather benign result means that the fears expressed by some commentators
(see Greenleaf in PL&B June/July 2005,
p3), that the APEC Framework might
create a data protection ‘bloc’ which is antagonistic to the
EU’s ‘adequacy’
requirements, have not been borne out. Even
though APEC has no such requirements of its own, it does not attempt to prevent
economies having data export restriction rules whether for domestic
transfer’ requirements.
The final version does not seem to take as strong a position as suggested by
Consultant’s Issues Paper
(Crompton and Ford, July 2005)
prepared for the second seminar in Korea. The consultants proposed that one of
three ‘implementation
objectives’ APEC ‘should work
toward’ is that ‘prevention of data flow across borders should not
be put forward
as a generally suitable remedy for privacy infringements that
involve two or more economies.’ The final version is consistent
proposal of the APEC consultants, but does not goes as far as the tenor of the
rest of their remarks suggest, which would
have at least involved discouraging
APEC economies from adopting data export restrictions. Such discouragement is
not found in the
APEC Framework, and nor is it found in the official Report on
the second seminar (APEC ECSG Privacy 2005). Whether export restrictions
discouraged in future APEC implementation seminars is another question, but it
is not found in the words of the Framework
At the end of this two and a half year process of development of the APEC
low set of privacy
standards (at best, OECD-near-equivalent), no requirements of any specific
enforcement measures, and no substantive
provisions concerning data exports. In
this sense it is the weakest international privacy standard yet developed. But
does not attempt to attach consequences in terms of data exports, its
weak principles and domestic implementation requirements do
not matter so much.
If it becomes a low standard to which Asia-Pacific countries only now starting
to develop privacy laws can aspire,
and the APEC processes help them achieve
such standards, it may perform a valuable role. The second implementation
seminar saw the
involvement of two of the regional countries not involved in the
first seminar (China and Indonesia), so APEC’s processes are
engage the attention of policymakers in major countries without privacy laws. At
least it is now safe for those who would
prefer higher privacy standards to
cooperate with APEC.
