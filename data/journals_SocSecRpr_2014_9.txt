Consideration
Disability support pension: portability; severe impairment
UDRZAL and SECRETARY to the DSS
Decided: 17th April 2014 by PE Hack
Udrzal was a long term recipient of disability support pension (DSP) and he
had lived in Bali for a number of years. Under the
Social Security Act 1991
(Cth) (the Act) DSP had been ‘portable’ for up to 13 weeks and it
was common for recipients who lived in Asia to return
to Australia briefly every
13 weeks. From 1 July 2011 the Families, Housing, Community Services &
Indigenous Affairs & Other
Legislation Amendment (Budget & Other
Measures) Act 2011 (Cth) changed the Act by adding the requirement that the
person must
continue to be an Australian resident in order to remain eligible
.On 23 January 2013 Udrzal attended the Centrelink Darwin Service Centre
where a residency assessment was completed, and he returned
to Bali on the same
day. Although Udrzal’s visits to Australia were frequent and regular,
Centrelink deemed he was a resident
of Bali, not Australia, and his DSP was
cancelled on 24 January 2013.
The main issue is whether the cancellation of DSP was correct, whether Udrzal
remained qualified for DSP, and whether Udrzal satisfied
the requirements of
s.1218AAA of the Act.
Legislation
The AAT had held that Udrzal needed to meet s.94 (1) of the Act and then the
added requirement of s.94 (1) (ea) which provides:
(1) A person is qualified for disability support pension if:
(ea) one of the following applies:
(i) the person is an Australian resident;
(ia) the person is absent from Australia and the Secretary has made a
determination in relation to the person under subsection 1218AAA
(ii) the person is absent from Australia and all the circumstances described
in paragraphs 1218AA(1)(a),(b),(c), (d) and (e) exist
in relation to the person.
The AAT held that Udrzal was not an Australian resident, that subparagraph
(ii) was not met, but queried if it was possible that a
determination could be
made under s.1218AAA (1) of the Act. That section reads:
(1) The Secretary may make a written determination that a particular
person’s maximum portability period for disability support
pension is an
unlimited period, if all of the following circumstances (the qualifying
circumstances) exist:
(a) the person is receiving disability support pension;
(b) the Secretary is satisfied that the person’s impairment is a severe
impairment (within the meaning of subsection 94(3B));
(c) the Secretary is satisfied that the person will have that severe
impairment for at least the next 5 years;
(d) the Secretary is satisfied that, if the person were in Australia, the
severe impairment would prevent the person from performing
independently of a program of support (within the meaning of subsection 94(4))
within the next 5 years.
(2) The Secretary must not make a determination under subsection (1) in
relation to a person who is outside Australia unless the Secretary
is satisfied
(a) the person is unable to return to Australia because of either of the
following events:
(i) a serious accident involving the person;
(ii) the hospitalisation of the person; and
(b) the person’s portability period for disability support pension had
not ended at the time the event occurred.
(3) The Secretary may revoke th e determination if any of the qualifying
circumstances ceases to exist.
(4) A determination under subsection (1) is not a legislative instrument.
(5) In this section: work means work:
(a) that is on wages that are at or above the relevant minimum wage; and
(b) that exists in Australia, even if not within the person’s locally
accessible labour market
Consideration
Section 1218AAA of the Act requires a severe impairment as defined in
s.94(3B). A Job Capacity Assessment (JCA) conducted by an exercise
physiologist
in October 2013 found that Udrzal had a traumatic brain injury suffered during a
stroke in October 2012, which warranted
a rating of 20 points on the Impairment
Tables. Udrzal had an additional 5 points for another impairment arising from
and he had diabetes, vasculitis and hypertension. For the purposes of
this decision, 20 points for the brain injury satisfied the
severe impairment
requirement.
The Secretary accepted, on 24 January 2013, paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) of
s.1218AAA were met:
• Udrzal was, immediately prior to the cancellation decision, receiving
disability support pension;
• Udrzal would have the impairment, the traumatic brain injury, for at
least the next five years; and
• the impairment would prevent him from performing any work
independently of the program of support within that period.
The Secretary argued that a determination under s.1218AAA could not be made
at the time of cancellation for three reasons. First,
Udrzal was outside
Australia when the cancellation decision was made; second, the job capacity
assessment was not undertaken in January
2013; thirdly, in January 2013, the
impairment, the traumatic brain injury, was not fully diagnosed, treated and
stabilised and likely
to persist for more than two years and so could not be
assigned a rating under the Impairment Tables.
On 24 January 2013, when the cancellation decision was made, Udrzal had
returned to Bali. The AAT found that the Act requires that
consideration of a
s.1218AAA determination precedes the decision to cancel, otherwise, the criteria
in s.1218AAA (1)(a) of the Act,
that the person be receiving disability support
pension, could not be satisfied. The AAT found that the decision maker ought to
considered the application of the unlimited portability provisions at the
time of cancellation.
The AAT found that proper ‘public administration requires the making of
prompt decisions, all the more so when delay will defeat
an otherwise valid
claim’. The decision was required on 23 January 2013 when Udrzal was in
Australia, or he could have been
asked to defer his return to Bali.
Udrzal stated that he was told on 23 January 2013 that a JCA could not be
organised for that day. He also statedthat he could have
delayed his return to
Bali if he had been advised that he would need to have a job capacity
assessment.
The Guide to Social Security Law, paragraph 7.1.1.10 suggests that DSP
recipients seeking unlimited portability under s.1218AAA (1)
‘are required
to undergo a portability assessment that includes the [Job Capacity Assessment]
processes’. The AAT held
that although a JCA may be
‘desirable’ to inform a determination under s.1218AAA it cannot be a
pre-requisite to the
determination unless the Act makes it so.
The Department accepted that, by October 2013, Udrzal’s condition was
fully treated, fully stabilised and more likely than not
to persist for more
than two years. However, in January 2013, it was too early to make that
determination, because the stroke had
occurred only 90 days earlier. The AAT
found that Udrzal had a stroke in October 2012. He could not walk unaided, the
functions of his hand were affected and he needed daily
physiotherapy. The medical practitioner’s report concluded that the
of these conditions would persist for more than 5 years and he would have a
residual deficit in functioning. The AAT found
that Udrzal had undertaken
reasonable treatment and was unlikely to gain significant functional
improvement.
The AAT stated that ‘what the definition of fully stabilised requires
continued treatment is unlikely to result in significant functional
improvement to
a level enabling the person to undertake work in the following two
Therefore in January 2013 it could be said that Udrzal’s condition had
been fully diagnosed, fully treated and fully stabilised.
He had a severe
impairment within the meaning of s.94 (3B) of the Act in January 2013 thereby
satisfying paragraph (b) of s.1218AAA
The decision to cancel Udrzal’s DSP was set aside and the matter
remitted to the respondent for reconsideration in accordance
with a direction
that a written determination be made pursuant to
Security Act 1991
The decision to cancel the applicant’s disability support pension was
set aside and a decision made in substitution that the
applicant’s
disability support pension not be cancelled.
