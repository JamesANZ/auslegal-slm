Falls Prevention and Management at Regis Pty Ltd:
Regis Pty Ltd has a comprehensive falls prevention and management framework in place that supports the proactive identification of
each residents falls risk.
The process of falls risk assessments commences upon request for the resident to be admitted to the Service. This pre-admission clinical
review is completed to ascertain if the Service is able to support a potential resident including environment and equipment that
may be required.
If the resident is identified as a high falls risk prior to admission a care planning consultation with the potential resident and
next of kin will be conducted to identify mitigation strategies and consider dignity of risk.
On admission day, any assessed supports or services that have been identified will be implemented including falls sensors/floor mats/bed
or chair sensors. These support needs are reviewed by allied health professionals (Physiotherapy) within the first two (2) days of
the resident’s arrival within the Service.
On day one the Falls Risk Assessment (FRAT) is formally documented within Autumn Care. Reassessment of a resident’s falls risk is
undertaken quarterly as part of the Care and Wellbeing review (involving the GP and Allied Health team), following an actual or near
miss fall, changes in the resident’s clinical condition or preferences expressed via resident.
Use of Sensor Alarms in falls prevention and management:
Sensor alarms are available for all residents assessed as requiring the support. The decision to implement a sensor alarm is informed
by the following factors:
* Falls history including frequency and mechanism of fall
* Changes in clinical condition
* Resident’s insight into their physical abilities and need to wait for staff to assist them to mobilise/transfer
* Resident/representative’s request
* Expressed fear from resident/representative of a fear of falling
* Allied health review and recommendation
* Residents’ sensory deficits that may impact an independent resident in some circumstances e.g. resident with visual deficit that
gets up during the night to go to the bathroom.
There is a defined process within each Service to ensure that there is always adequate stores of sensor alarms. This process is monitored
by the clinical care team.
