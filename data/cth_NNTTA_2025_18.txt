Native Title Act
[3] Between
October 2024 and March 2025, I convened a number of conferences in these matters
to allow the parties time to explore
the possibility of agreement. The parties
also discussed plans for a Wajarri Yamaji representative to visit Mr Clark to
discussions.
[4] After the
proposed meeting did not proceed, on 27 March 2025, the Tribunal wrote to the
parties advising that, due to the delays
and lack of progress, I proposed to
make directions. The parties were afforded an opportunity to comment on the
draft directions
but only the State responded to note it had no further
directions on 1 April 2025, in accordance with which Wajarri Yamaji’s
material was due to be provided by 26 May 2025.
However, it did not comply by
the due date, nor did it seek an extension of time. On 17 June 2025, the
Tribunal wrote to the parties,
advising that the applications were at risk of
dismissal and giving Wajarri Yamaji until 24 June 2025 to provide reasons for
failure to comply and request any further time. No response was
[6] The Tribunal
may dismiss an objection application at any stage of the inquiry in
circumstances where the native title party fails
within a reasonable time to
proceed with the application or to comply with a direction of the Tribunal:
Native Title Act
. I am satisfied on the facts of these matters
that Wajarri Yamaji’s applications should be dismissed.
expedited procedure objection applications in relation to special prospecting
licences P 51/3392-S and P 51/3405-S are dismissed
