Introduction
Technical developments in data collection, storage and analytics have
provided firms with new opportunities for reaching
Firms may now target
adverts to individual consumers based on predicted preferences derived from
their digital profile.
predictive analytics that enable targeted advertising also open the possibility
of differential or discriminatory pricing deployed
against individual consumers.
Firms are able to use algorithms to individualise price offerings to consumers,
and to vary pricing
strategies in a short period of time in response to
information about consumers’ responses to the advertising sent to
There are a number of
potential harms to consumers in differential pricing, including the impairing
consumer choice, and also discrimination
and inequitable or unfair treatment.
Although many consumers are yielding personal data that fuels these processes,
it is not clear
that they understand the consequences of such uses. Further, the
incidence of differential pricing is difficult to discover. Such
conduct runs
counter to the common emphasis in formulations of standards for ethics in the
use of artificial intelligence, which
emphasise transparency and opportunities
to contest adverse decisions.
This article considers the harms to consumers occasioned by differential
pricing and legal strategies for promoting greater transparency,
provides a pathway to contestability. It does this by particular reference to
the recent revelation of differential pricing

Data driven differential pricing
Differential pricing allows firms to vary the price of goods or services for
different individuals or groups of
Differential pricing is
made possible by the large amounts of information gathered when consumers sign
up for a service, such as
name, gender, location, interests, as well as data
derived from consumers’ browsing, purchase and download
Firms use this data to
distinguish consumers between according to their predicted price
sensitivity.
Firms can then offer
products to consumers at prices that accord with these predictions and also
steer consumers to more highly priced
Differential pricing can be difficult to
precisely because each
consumer will be given a different price, and will not see what others are
An example in Australia
has nonetheless come from the consumer advocacy group
In August 2020, Choice
published a study finding that Tinder was charging different prices to different
users for its premium service
Users over the age of 30
were charged double those under 30, and prices also varied greatly even within
age brackets. Furthermore,
prices differed as between consumers in regional
areas as compared to urban areas, people who were queer or with non-binary
identities. The pricing difference for the premium
services suggests Tinder’s algorithm sets the pricing tailored to
each individual
user based upon predictions about how much they are willing to
pay. It is likely that this differential pricing is a central part
a business model. Tinder offers no explanation for the prices quoted to users
and hence consumers are unlikely to be aware of
the differences. Indeed, it may
be that remaining taboos surrounding online dating disincentivise consumers from
disclosing their
payment habits. This makes it easier for Tinder to offer
algorithmically generated prices without explanation.
A recent survey by Choice found that generally consumers do not think
differential pricing is fair, but this depends somewhat on the
basis of the
difference:
• ‘14% say it's fair to charge higher earners more than lower
income earners’
• ‘13% say it's fair to charge people living in wealthier areas
more than those in less wealthy areas’;
• the majority of consumers ‘believe these practices are unfair
(74% and 77%, respectively)’; and
• ‘about a quarter of Australians (26%) would be happy to pay a
different price based on the use of personal information
if the pricing benefits
The harms of differential pricing
We suggest that there are a number of possible harms arising from
differential pricing. Such conduct may decrease overall consumer
welfare through
consumers paying too much for a
Of course consumers can
always choose not to buy a product or can hunt around for alternatives. The
problem is that consumers may
not realise that a range of possible prices are
being made available for any particular product and this may distort their
to what is a good price for that product.
There are some ethical objections to differential pricing as well, arising
from the unequal, and potentially unfair, treatment of
consumers. As the Choice
survey suggests, some people may not object to well-off consumers being charged
more for certain goods and
services, as may be the philosophy informing
Tinder’s charging older consumer more than younger ones. This approach to
differential
pricing may then benefit consumers who are not as financially
capable of paying, therefore prioritising the interests of groups such
students, retirees and those from lower socio-economic demographics. However,
the selection of who can pay may more be inaccurate
because attributes such as
age and location are, at best, crude approximations of wealth.
Differential pricing also work against the interests of already disadvantaged
consumers. For example, firms might use profiling to
charge higher prices to
low-income consumers either to discourage them as customers or as a form of
insurance against credit and
performance risks perceived to attach to specific
groups of customers.
addition, differential pricing might to discriminate against certain consumers
on the basis of protected attributes such as age,
gender or race, which is bias
that can also be perpetuated by the
algorithms.
The data the
algorithm uses to learn is based on consumer preference. If
people prefer faces of those with the same colour skin
them, the matching algorithms will learn to segregate users based
on colour. Discrimination law prohibits discrimination based on
attributes such as sex, race, disability, age, sexuality, gender identity,
parental and carer responsibilities, and political
or religious
Choice quotes an
anti-discrimination specialist who says that Tinder’s
differential pricing that burdens older users would
unlawful age discrimination.
As a society we may not think it is fair for firms to treat consumers who are
less well-off differently from those who are better
off. Even where differential
pricing is justified there is the problem of consumers being placed in the wrong
pricing category for
their own circumstances. However, because the differential
pricing practice are so opaque, it will be difficult for consumers and
regulators to contest cases involving unlawful discrimination or error, and for
policymakers to assess the extent of the associated
harm. Thus, the first step
in allowing differential pricing strategies to be contestable is to seek greater
transparency.
Responses to consumer protection in differential pricing
Firms might consider that it is in their interests to be transparent to
consumers about their use of differential
This could be seen as a
way of building trust with consumers and supporting a good reputation for fair
dealing in the market. But
we think these issues are too important to be left to
the discretion of individual firms. We suggest more emphasis should be placed
legal mechanisms for promoting greater transparency in differential pricing,
including through prohibitions on misleading conduct,
direct disclosure requirements.
Prohibitions on misleading conduct
One key response to the use of differential pricing is in the prohibition on
misleading conduct in s 18 of the
Australian Consumer
For example,
advertising a best price guarantee for a product may be misleading if different
consumers are, for no good reason, presented
with different prices but not the
best price. Earlier this year, the Federal Court found travel
site Trivago
engaged in misleading conduct when
its algorithm recommended hotel rooms based on who
paid the most for ad clicks, not on the
price available.
The prohibition on misleading conduct does not only apply to positive
misrepresentations. Omissions and silence can also mislead.
This will be the
case if other conduct has created a misleading impression or, in the context,
consumers have a reasonable expectation
of disclosure of key
information.
Thus, a website
that implicitly creates an expectation of equal prices for all consumers may be
misleading if it fails to disclose
the reality of differential pricing. Tinder's
inform the range of prices available to customers. It is not clear whether
its website creates an expectation of equal pricing but
the fact the Tinder Plus
service does not distinguish between different categories of users might suggest
this to be the case. Research
has shown that the three primary concerns of users
of online dating apps are ‘personal security, misrepresentation and
recognition’,
however these concerns directly relate to how their
potential date and themselves are presented and recognised, not how the platform
represents the service.
concerns are internalised, allowing for misrepresentation on the platform to go
Data rights and consent
A second method for improving the transparency of differential pricing is
through strong requirements for consumers to have provided
informed consent to
such uses of their personal data. The ‘price’ for consumers
obtaining access to digital services
is commonly foregoing control of their
data. In many contexts in Australia, consumers are not required in law expressly
to these practices. Under the
(Cth) entities
do not need to seek consent to collect personal information where it is
‘reasonably necessary for one or more
of the entity’s functions or
activities’.
suggests that data collection about a consumer web browsing activities might be
reasonably necessary for a digital platform
to perform its advertising
Similarly, firms
providing a service may be entitled to use that information to tailor both the
service and the price.
Firms collecting and repurposing data must have a privacy policy disclosing
how personal information is collected, held and
