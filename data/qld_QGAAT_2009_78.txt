REASONS FOR DECISION
HISTORY OF THE APPLICATION
[1] BAG first came to the attention of the Tribunal in March 2004 when an
application was lodged by the Guardianship and Administration
Board of Tasmania
seeking recognition in Queensland of directions issued by the Tasmanian Board to
the attorneys for BAG. On 23 July
2004 the Tribunal dismissed the application
but made a declaration that BAG did not have capacity for all personal and
matters and that the Enduring Power of Attorney dated 13 June 2002
appointing DD and DP had commenced.
[2] On 18 September 2004 BAG lodged an application with the Tribunal seeking a
declaration about his capacity. On 5 August 2008 the
Tribunal made a declaration
that BAG had capacity for all personal matters and simple financial matters. The
Public Trustee of Queensland
was appointed as administrator for BAG for all
financial matters except for managing his day to day finances. The appointment
current until further order of the Tribunal.
[3] On 7 July 2009 BAG lodged an application for a declaration as to his
capacity for financial matters with a view to having the
appointment of the
administrator revoked.
The Issues and the Legislation
Section 138A
Guardianship and Administration Act 2000
the Tribunal power to dismiss an application at any stage of a proceeding on its
own initiative if the Tribunal is satisfied
the application is misconceived or
lacks substance.
The Evidence
[5] The Tribunal relied on the following written material on the Tribunal
(a) Application
by BAG lodged on 7 July 2009;
(b) Letter from
Dr R dated 14 May 2009 and attached references from RG dated 16 November 2004
and SA dated 17 December 2004;
(c) Letter from
NA dated 24 June 2009 and attached copy letter to the Public Trust Office dated
10 June 2009, letter by KL dated 9
June 2009 and document by BAG appointing NA
as his attorney dated 14 February 2008; and
memorandum by Tribunal registry officer dated 19 August 2009.
[6] The last mentioned document is a record of a conversation between a registry
officer of the Tribunal and BAG. The record is as
Rang BAG to
see if he could attend a hearing on Friday, 28/08. BAG advised that he was going
into hospital on Monday for an operation
to remove a cancer on his lungs. Then
depending on how well he recovered he would have surgery to replace a faulty
heart valve. BAG
agreed that his application should be dismissed and that he
would lodge a new application once he had recovered.”
[7] The Tribunal was satisfied that BAG gave his consent
to his application being dismissed on the basis that he was not in a position,
due to temporary ill health, to proceed to a hearing of that application. The
Tribunal was satisfied that BAG had been properly informed,
and that he
understood that he could lodge a new application seeking a declaration of
capacity that would revoke the appointment
of his administrator once his health
had recovered. As there was no longer any intention to proceed with his current
application,
there was no matter of substance remaining to be adjudicated by the
[8] It was appropriate for the application for review to be dismissed in
accordance with
section 138A
Guardianship and Administration Act 2000
