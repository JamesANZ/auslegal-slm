grouped dwelling – use of right-of-way for access
Cases referred to
The Tribunal:
1. This is an appeal from the refusal of the Respondent of an application for
development of a 2 grouped dwelling development at
152 Samson Street White Gum
Valley. The land is more particularly described as Lot 63 on Deposited Plan
2. Lot 63 is a battleaxe lot with access from Samson Street, but with frontage
to a right of way (“
”), which runs parallel to Samson
Street, and between Wongan Avenue and Minilya Avenue. The ROW is Crown land. The
application
was lodged on 10 March 2004 for 2 grouped dwellings, and thereafter,
the application underwent a number of modifications to satisfy
the concerns of
the town planning officers of the Respondent.
3. The proposal is for one grouped dwelling (Unit 2) to gain access from the
existing battleaxe, and the other (Unit 1) to gain access
via the ROW.
4. The application was finally considered by the Respondent’s Development
Assessment Committee on 15 November 2004, where the
application was refused for
the following reasons:
“ 1. The proposal would prejudice the orderly and proper planning of the
2. Streetscape and amenity issues associated with the Right Of
5. The Respondent was unable to explain how the proposal prejudiced the orderly
and proper planning of the area in a general sense,
but for the issue of the use
of the ROW. It would appear from the documentation that there are no outstanding
design issues with
the built form of the building. However, the issue of access
from and to the ROW remains live.
6. It was clear from the documents provided by the Respondent that a number of
residents surrounding Lot 63 objected to the proposal
on the basis of the use of
the ROW for sole access to Unit 1.
7. This however, is at odds with the Respondent’s own study document,
entitled “City of Fremantle Right of Way Study”.
In the Study, this
ROW is earmarked for upgrading.
8. In addition, and most importantly, Lot 63 is the subject of a survey-strata
approval, issued pursuant to the
Strata Titles Act 1985
by the Western
Australian Planning Commission (“
9. This approval was given on 29 January 2004, and subject to the conditions
being cleared in the ordinary way, the new lots will
be created. This
survey-strata subdivision reflects the form of development which is the subject
of this appeal. That is, the lot
upon which Unit 1 is to be developed abuts the
10. Indeed, condition 1 and 2 of the Commission’s approval relate to the
upgrading of the ROW:
“1. The ceding of a 1m wide strip of
land along the rear lot boundary for the widening of the adjoining right-of-way,
on the Diagram or Plan of Survey (deposited plan) as such, and vested in
the Crown under section 20A of the
Town Planning and Development Act
such land to be ceded free of cost and without any payment of compensation by
the Crown. (LG).
2. The section of the Right of Way abutting the rear of the property being
constructed to the satisfaction of the Western Australian
Planning Commission.
11. It is clear to me that the City of Fremantle’s own study and the
Commission’s conditions, both requiring the widening
and upgrading of the
ROW lead to the irresistible conclusion that it is contemplated that the ROW
will be used for vehicular access.
12. Once the survey-strata of Lot 63 is finalised and the plans endorsed by the
Commission, the ROW will be the sole access for one
of the lots.
13. For these reasons, I have allowed the appeal, and make the following
(a) The appeal is allowed.
(b) The application for 2 grouped dwellings is approved, in accordance with the
most recent plans lodged.
(c) The Respondent should provide the Appellant with a list of appropriate
conditions to attach to the approval within 14 days of
this decision.
(d) If the parties are unable to agree on the conditions to be imposed, there is
liberty to apply to the Tribunal for those matters
to be dealt with by way of
