complainant pay the respondents’ costs, fixed in the sum of
$12,832.00.
CATCHWORDS:
Assessment of costs.
REPRESENTATION:
Ms Khamsone of Carne Reidy Herd, Lawyers, for the complainant.
Mr A K Herbert of counsel, instructed by Swift Australia Pty Ltd, for
the respondents.
19 November 2008, I ordered the complainant’s complaint be dismissed.
On 4 December 2008, I further ordered the complainant
respondents’ costs of the proceedings, to be agreed. Failing agreement, I
directed there be an exchange of the costs
claimed, and objections in relation
respondents have now delivered their statement of costs, and the complainant has
delivered her notice of objections. The respondents
have advised the Registrar
they do not wish to make submissions in reply thereto.
to the respondents’ statement of costs, costs in the sum of $22,066.00 are
claimed, being Counsel’s fees for
preparation, settling material, and
appearing at the conciliation and hearing. The complainant asserts the total
costs to be awarded
should be $9,949.50.
shall deal with each of the components claimed, and the objections thereto.
respondents claim $1,386.00 for perusal of the complainant’s application,
and drafting and producing a response, including
copying and serving the
respondents’ documents. The complainant asserts $812.00 should be allowed
for this component, on the
basis the respondents are not entitled to claim the
costs of copying and serving documents unless this work was performed by
and there is nothing reflected in Counsel’s memorandum of fees to
indicate such work was performed by him. There is substance
to this objection.
I allow $812.00 on account of this component.
respondents claim $6,710.00 for perusal of the complainant’s witness
statements and preparing the respondents’ statements
in reply, including
the cost of copying and serving the respondents’ documents. The
complainant asserts $2,897.50 should be
allowed for this component. In reaching
this figure, the complainant, whilst accepting the cost for drafting and
producing the respondents’
witness statement would be $3,210.00, submits
this sum ought to be halved to allow for the fact that Counsel was engaged to
settle draft witness statements
there is substance in a submission that a proportion of this sum ought not to be
allowed, I do not accept that proportion should
represent one-half of the amount
” documents entails significant work,
particularly in relation to the settling of witness statements, which
essentially amount
to the evidence-in-chief to be led in the Tribunal hearing by
the respondents. In the circumstances, I allow 80 per cent of the
$3,210.00, namely, $2,568.00. Allowing that sum, and the other amount claimed
under this component, $850.00, the amount allowed
for this component totals
respondents claim $990.00 for perusal of the complainant’s submissions on
costs, and preparing a response thereto, including
copying and serving the
respondents’ documents. The complainant asserts $442.50 ought to be
allowed for this component, on
the basis the respondents cannot claim copying
and serving of documents by Counsel when Counsel did not claim to have
this task. For the reasons referred to above, I uphold that
objection. I allow $442.50 under this component.
final components sought by the respondents relate to attendance of Counsel at
conciliation, and at the Tribunal hearing. A sum
of $3,080.00 is claimed on
account of attendance at conciliation, and $9,900.00 is claimed on account of
attendance at the hearing.
complainant asserts $480.00 should be allowed for the attendance at
conciliation, and $5,760.00 should be allowed for attendance
at the hearing. In
reaching the latter figure, the complainant asserts approximately 8 hours
per day ought to be allowed in respect
of each day of the hearing.
regard to the hours the Tribunal sat, and recognising the reasonable need for
conferences, I allow 4 hours for attendance at
conciliation, and 10 hours
per day for attendance at the hearing. Allowing $60.00 per quarter hour, this
totals $960.00 for conciliation
and $7,200.00 for hearing. I allow $8,160.00
for these components.
order the complainant pay the respondents’ costs, fixed in the sum of
$12,832.00.
