DR DANN and
MR HORSELY,
No 363 of 2008
SERVICES COMMISSIONER
ROBIN CARL TAMPOE
..DATE 05/06/2009
HER HONOUR: The respondent, Robin Carl Tampoe, is the subject
of two charges before this Tribunal. The Commissioner has
alleged that charge 1 constitutes professional misconduct, or,
alternatively, unsatisfactory professional conduct. The
charge is accepted as particularised. It is therefore
necessary to say what the particulars are.
They are that on the 26th of June 2005, without excuse or
authority, Mr Tampoe breached his duty of confidentiality to
his client, Schapelle Corby, in that he publicly disclosed and
commented upon confidential information. He was at the time a
legal practitioner in Australia and a principal of the law
practice Hoolihans Lawyers.
Ms Corby had been charged in Indonesia in October 2004 with a
number of serious criminal offences arising from allegations
of drug smuggling. In February 2005, Mr Ron Bakir retained
Hoolihans Lawyers to assist Ms Corby’s Indonesian lawyers
representing her. The client agreement set out the work to be
undertaken as part of the retainer as follows:
"The firm will take all steps necessary to assist the
Indonesian legal team currently representing Schapelle Corby
against drug charges in Indonesia which shall include but not
be limited to the following: investigate the claim and gather
evidence, provide advice in respect of the claim, attend to
all procedures necessary for the disclosure by Australian or
other bodies of information relevant to the defence, including
attendance at conferences with representatives of such
appearing before the media or presenting press releases
may assist the matter, issue Court proceedings if necessary,
assist in attending to all pre-trial preparation, engage
counsel and other experts, attend at trial as necessary and
attend to all such other matters as required."
The respondent, Mr Tampoe, was the principal solicitor
responsible for performing that work on behalf of Hoolihans
Lawyers. The purpose and effect of the client agreement was
to engage Mr Tampoe to act as a legal practitioner on behalf
of Schapelle Corby. He says in his statement in reply that he
was under the mistaken belief that Mr Bakir was his client and
therefore there was no retainer or solicitor/client
relationship between himself and Ms Corby. He accepts that
the allegations as made were correct and so that he was wrong
in that view.
The charge continues: that the work undertaken by Mr Tampoe
was part of the retainer included, but was not limited to
providing legal advice to Ms Corby and members of her family
acting as her agents in respect of the drug charges, the
investigation of those charges and the media attention related
In the course of this retainer, Mr Tampoe acted as a legal
practitioner on behalf of Ms Corby, thereby establishing a
solicitor/client relationship between himself and her. At all
material times, he held himself out to be her lawyer and
purported to act on her behalf in accordance within the
agreement. She believed that he was retained to act as
legal representative and instructed him in accordance with
that belief. Members of her family, including her sister,
Mercedes, provided instructions to Mr Tampoe as agents for
On a date unknown, while Mr Tampoe was in Indonesia carrying
out his retainer, he had a conversation with Mercedes Corby,
Ron Bakir and another person. In the course of that
conversation, Ms Mercedes Corby provided the respondent with
instructions about past criminal convictions within the Corby
family. Those instructions were provided by her acting as
agent for her sister and were intended to be confidential. At
the time of receiving those instructions, Mr Tampoe knew or
ought to have known that the information discussed in the
course of that conversation was confidential.
In a television interview published on 26 June 2005 on the
Channel 9 program "Sunday", Mr Tampoe disclosed the content of
that conversation and further commented on the confidential
information by saying that Mercedes Corby had lied to him. In
disclosing and commenting on confidential information, the
respondent breached his duty of confidentiality to his client,
Ms Schapelle Corby.
He further says in response that he was under the belief that
the information which he discussed was public knowledge and
not confidential. By accepting the charge as particularised,
he has accepted that the information was given to
confidentially and he has breached his duty of
confidentiality
by revealing it.
In my view, this represents professional misconduct. It is
fundamental to the relationship between solicitor and client
that the legal practitioner will not reveal confidential
information. It is hard to think of a more egregious breach
than to do so on a national television program.
The second charge is an allegation of unsatisfactory
Professional conduct. It is that in the course of Mr Tampoe's
participation in a documentary, "Schapelle Corby: The Hidden
Truth", he made statements which were scandalous, offensive
and/or likely to bring the profession into disrepute.
Mr Tampoe submits that after careful consideration of this
charge he accepts the charge as particularised. He says that
the director and producer of the documentary
followed him
everywhere whilst researching the documentary and caught him
at an inopportune time, and in response to certain statements
said about him he regretfully made the comments which are
detailed in charge 2. He says that at the time of making such
comments he did not fully appreciate the effect and
implications of the same.
The particulars of charge 2 are that Mr Tampoe willingly
participated in the making of the documentary between October
2004 and June 2008. That documentary was then broadcast on
television in Australia by the Nine Network on 22 and 24 June
2008. Mr Tampoe participated in the documentary by giving
interviews, making comments and allowing himself to be
recorded for the purpose of the documentary. He was aware
that statements or comments he made in the course of
participating in the documentary may be recorded and publicly
broadcast at some future date.
In the course of his participation in the documentary,
Mr Tampoe made the following statements and/or comments which
were scandalous, offensive and likely to bring the profession
into disrepute. Referring to the Corby family he said, "These
are the biggest, the biggest pile of trash I have ever come
across in my life. I've never..I've never seen a more
ungrateful, um, nasty, piece of work as this woman and this
He also observed, "I'm watching Roz, Roz, Rose Leigh, whatever
her fucking name is, Corby. On, on TV last night, 'cause now
she thinks she is a fucking rock star. Superstar. Talkin' to
Ray. Puttin' shit on ahh everybody. On everybody."
He also said, "What a, what a fuckin' change of um..., you
look at that family when we were over there fuckin' doing the
trial. Couldn't 've been happier." He also said, "Speak to
the brother. Speak to the younger brother. Speak to the
older brother. That's what Downer said to me. Look at the
brothers. His own office knows what's been goin' on. This
family believes that, believes their own shit mate."
Then there were a number of statements which referred to what
was called the baggage-handler defence. This was apparently a
defence which sought to lay the blame on what had occurred on
baggage handlers. He said in respect of that, "Baggage
handling defence? It's got nothin' to do with the case.
Three weeks to put a defence together, I put a defence
together. Baggage handlers didn't put drugs in the bag.
Nothin' to do with it. But now, now, now she believes it.
They all fuckin' believe it. It's not true. That's why you
can't put...direct evidence [indistinct] the baggage handlers
'cause they didn't do it."
In response to a question he said, "I don't give a shit. You
want to fuckin' attack me? I gave you the defence, I'll take
it away. As fast as I gave it, I'll take it away." Laughing
he said, "Yeah, sorry about that guys (...laughing...) Poor
buggers. No huhm..., I won't do it again (...laughing...).
Thanks for the defence (...laughing...)" That is said to
refer again to the baggage-handlers defence and presumably is
addressed to the baggage handlers who it was wrongly claimed
by him were responsible.
What is of greater concern in those comments is that he is
representing in information then conveyed to the public that
the role of the criminal defence is to make up a defence which
it can then take away. This is clear when he says, "I gave
you the defence, I'll take it away." This is certainly likely
to bring the legal profession into disrepute with the public.
In fact, a person acting as a criminal defence legal
practitioner cannot under any circumstances invent facts or
invent a defence. To say such a thing is scandalous and is
likely to cause the public to lose confidence in not only the legal
profession but in the criminal justice system, because it suggests
response to a criminal charge what one should do is find a legal practitioner
who will make up a defence for the alleged
offender. Nothing could be further
from the truth.
The manner in which he spoke of his client and her family, of
course, was also scandalous and offensive.
It is my view, and I have had the assistance of the views of
the other members of the tribunal, that the person who has
behaved in the way particularised is not suitable to be a
legal practitioner.
In the circumstances, the tribunal‘s order is a
recommendation that the name of Robin Carl Tampoe be removed
from the roll of legal practitioners.
HER HONOUR: I order that the respondent pay the applicant's
costs of the application fixed in the amount of $2,500. Those
are the orders of the tribunal.
