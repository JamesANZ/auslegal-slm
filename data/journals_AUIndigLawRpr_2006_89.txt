1.1 Parties
The parties to this Agreement are:
Indigenous organisations;
Local Government;
the Commonwealth of Australia (Australian Government); and
the State Government of Western Australia (WA Government).
1.2 Purpose
This Agreement sets out strategic and innovative approaches and projects for
joint action by Indigenous organisations and individuals,
Industry and
Governments to address the unacceptably high levels of unemployment experienced
by young Indigenous people in the East
Kimberley. In doing so, the parties to
this Agreement seek to build sustainable, prosperous communities to maximize
opportunities
for individuals to:
gain and create employment in mining and other industries;
seek and engage in training and education; and
share in the wealth created by the presence of the mining industry in the
region and that arises from engagement in mainstream employment.
parties share a vision for the region which aims to address Indigenous
disadvantage and supports Indigenous people to take up
opportunities in the
mainstream economy.
The Agreement is made in a spirit of partnership and shared responsibility
and with the understanding that this work benefits the
whole community of the
East Kimberley. (Throughout this document ‘community’ is intended to
cover discrete Indigenous
communities and towns.)
This Agreement is intended to be a statement of the mutual intentions of the
parties and is not intended to give rise to any enforceable
rights or binding
obligations on the part of any party.
This Agreement has no effect on native title agreements currently in place in
the region. Projects under this Agreement may complement
activity undertaken in
accordance with other arrangements or agreements.
1.3 Targets
The 2001 Census data indicated that only 13.6% of the Indigenous population
aged 15 years and above was employed compared with 66.1%
of the non-Indigenous
population aged 15 years and above. The parties to the Agreement are committed
to ambitious targets to address
this inequity.
The key targets are:
to place at least 300 additional Indigenous people in jobs in the East
Kimberley on an annual basis over the next five years, as a
significant step
towards achieving equity in rates of Indigenous and non-Indigenous
employment;
to reduce to the rate of Indigenous unemployment in the East Kimberley by
50% within five years; and
to equalise the rates of Indigenous and non-Indigenous employment in the
region within ten years.
1.4 Geographic Scope
The geographic scope of the Agreement will initially cover the towns of
Kununurra, Halls Creek, Wyndham and the Warmun Indigenous
Community and
outstations. Actions will extend further through the East Kimberley during the
next five years. It is recognised that
initial projects or actions within this
scope will also provide some services to those who generally live elsewhere in
the region.
1.5 Key Principles
The National Framework Principles for Service Delivery to Indigenous
Australians, endorsed at the Council of Australian Governments
(COAG) meeting on
25 June 2004, underpin the approach that the WA and Australian Governments wish
to take. These principles are:
Sharing responsibility;
Harnessing the mainstream;
Streamlining service delivery;
Establishing transparency and accountability;
Developing a learning framework; and
Focusing on priority areas.
Early childhood development and growth;
Early school engagement and performance;
Positive childhood and transition to adulthood;
Substance use and misuse;
Functional and resilient families and communities;
Effective environmental health systems; and
Economic participation and development.
Further, this Agreement
is founded on the following principles agreed to in the Minerals Council of
Australia and Australian Government
Memorandum of Understanding (MCA MOU):
Collaboration and partnership between the parties based on mutual
Collaboration and partnership between the parties based on shared
responsibilities and respect for culture, customs and values;
The integration of sustainable development considerations within the MOU
partnership decision-making process; and
Joint commitment to social, economic and institutional development of the
communities with which the parties engage.
1.6 Roles and Responsibilities
All parties to the Agreement will contribute to achieving the desired
outcomes, at a level determined by the capacity of each party.
Indigenous Organisations

function in encouraging Indigenous individuals and communities
to participate in
the economic pathways to Indigenous prosperity. Indigenous organisations will
contribute to the coordination of
local efforts to inform and engage community
members in the opportunities that this RPA will present.
Australian Government
The Australian Government will coordinate service delivery and development of
actions, including those under Shared Responsibility
Agreements (SRAs), with
identified communities through the Kununurra Indigenous Coordination Centre
(Kununurra ICC). The Kununurra
ICC will provide:
a point of contact for Australian Government programs and services and
resources to the Indigenous people and communities of the East
a primary contact point for the development and implementation of SRAs and
RPAs with the communities on behalf of the Australian Government.
The Government of Western Australia

development of project plans under this Agreement through
the East Kimberley

The Australian Government, the WA Government and Local
Government, represented by the Shire of Wyndham-East Kimberley agree to:
provide efficient and effective Government services;
provide maximum opportunities for employment of Indigenous people;
encourage individual and community participation in its initiatives;
pursue new opportunities for enhancing cooperative approaches.
Industry and Employers
Industry and employers will work within the spirit and principles outlined in
the MCA MOU with the Australian Government. Industry

and employing more Indigenous people; and
participate in a leadership group of East Kimberley businesses to support
actions that will increase employment of Indigenous people.

Australia. The West Australian Government recently signed a third agreement with
parties in the Port Hedland area. The Agreements are available online at the
