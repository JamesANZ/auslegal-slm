Navigating the AI transformation journey
Navigating the AI
transformation journey
Renée Green
12 November 2020
Technology is dramatically changing the world that we live in, providing a
tremendous opportunity for improved efficiency, growth
and transformation.
Emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (
Robotics, Virtual and Augmented Reality and Blockchain are driving this change.
AI is at the heart of this transformation
– it is radically transforming
our work, our society and the way we do business.
In basic terms, AI is a system that can do tasks that humans use their
intelligence to do, enabling machines to learn from experience,
adjust to new
inputs and perform humanlike tasks with some degree of autonomy. AI is not just
one technology – it is an umbrella
term for multiple technologies such as
machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing and computer
vision, any and
all of which might be used in a business. These technologies can
all support a wide range of business needs, in particular by:
• delivering business insights through the digital analysis of big
• automating processes: AI has the ability to undertake high-volume and
repetitive tasks in a shorter time frame than a human.
It can be used to
optimise business operations and processes, and enhance product or service
features and functions; and
• enhancing customer engagement by improving personalisation.
Implementing and/or investing in AI can impact all aspects of a business,
including strategy, products and services, supply chain,
routes to market,
customer relations or people, and so comes with a number of risks and
challenges. From a legal perspective, challenges
are likely to arise in relation
to data protection compliance, intellectual property, employment and potentially
competition law.
There are a number of steps an organisation can take to successfully
implement AI within the business, including:
• Carefully consider and scope the use case. Conduct research on other
similar AI implementation projects, noting the success
stories and pitfalls.
• Consider the infrastructure that will need to be built or acquired to
support the AI.
• Secure buy-in from senior stakeholders – the full organisation
should be committed to the project (including by way
of allocating appropriate
budget and resources).
• Plan to upskill staff, change the organisational structure (as
appropriate) and recruit any necessary digital skillsets.
• Create a roadmap – plan a route from BAU, including
implementation phases, noting the above information and any gaps
during this process. Maintain and update this map on a regular basis to note
changes in the organisation or market.
The successful adoption of an emerging technology, such as AI, can be
complicated and unpredictable. However, the significant benefits
that AI can
bring to an organisation willing to embrace it will often outweigh these risks,
giving the organisation a competitive
edge in the market.
