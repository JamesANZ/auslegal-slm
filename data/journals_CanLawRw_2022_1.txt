INTRODUCTION
The mid-2022 issue of
Canberra Law Review
features articles from
Australian contributors regarding crime, technology, law reform and legal
education alongside a review of
major work on constitutional reform as a remedy
for political disenchantment, particularly relevant given violence by the far
at the end of 2021 such as the burning of the main entry to Old Parliament
Molly Young’s ‘Law vs Science: Genomic Evidence, Wrongful
Convictions and the Requirement for a Statutory Framework’
explores the
limitations of DNA evidence, with specific reference to wrongful convictions.
The article engages with Australian and
overseas jurisprudence, jury
misunderstandings of evidence with a statistical and scientific basis, innocence
testing and post-conviction
review schemes. It offers specific recommendations
for improvements in the criminal justice system.
‘What To Teach When Teaching Law: The Categories, Rights, Duties And
Test (‘CRDT’) Framework’ by Benedict
Sheehy, Juan
Diaz-Granados and Tomas Fitzgerald deals with pedagogical methodologies specific
to law. It draws on debate in Australia
and overseas regarding historic and
current approaches, including the ‘case study’. The article offers a
valuable contribution
to teaching undergraduate and graduate students in online,
hybrid and face to face models, potentially encouraging debate among both
legal profession, academics and advanced students.
Mizcedes Cripps’ ‘How Does Australian Copyright Law Respond To
Obscenity In An Era Of Digital Technology?’ considers
the copyright status
of works that are deemed to be obscene, a categorisation that covers a wide
range of perceived or substantive
harms in contemporary and past law. Cripps
notes divergence in judicial recognition of copyright in textual and graphic
works, with
the United Kingdom having a different stance to that of Australia
and the United States of America. Her article engages with questions
shifting notions of harm, the principles underlying censorship and rationales
for protection under the
(Cth) and similar
Bruce Baer Arnold’s ‘Surveillance Machines in Ivory Towers?
Surveillance Capitalism, Dignity and Learning Management Systems’
spirited, indeed provocative, perspective on the embrace of the digital
platforms that are now axiomatic in Australian law
schools because of COVID-19
and the expectations of ‘digital natives’. The article extends
scholarly literature regarding
online anonymous student feedback by asking
whether we can construe the platforms as ‘surveillance machines’
that resemble
other online data collection mechanisms within ‘surveillance
capitalism’.
Adam Jardine, Marilyn Bromberg and Nicholas Cardaci refer to ‘A Special
Place in the Heart, A Special Place in the Law’
in ‘No More Fighting
Like Cats And Dogs: It’s Time For A New Pet Custody Model In
Australia’. It is an insightful
piece that engages with the increasingly
rich theorisation about personhood for non-human animals and the jurisprudence
of the Federal
Circuit and Family Court of Australia regarding pets as chattels.
The authors argue for discussion of modifying Australian law to
reflect changed
social understandings of companion animals, adopting an alternative model of pet
custody that does not rely on the
premise that pets are property. The article
discusses three alternative models of pet custody: the Pets as Persons Model,
Sentimentality
Model, and the Liminal Model. It concludes that any of these
three models would be superior to the extant pet custody model in Australia,
would better reflect Australian attitudes and values.
‘The Cadaveric Organ Shortage: a result of Australia’s organ
procurement framework?’ by Jack Hassall critiques principle
and practice
regarding post-mortem organ collection for transplantation, analysing the
complex domestic regime and benchmarking it
against overseas frameworks (notably
that in Spain). The article highlights bioethics issues alongside questions
sharing and a range of statutes.
A review by Bruce Baer Arnold and Damon Smith considers Bede Harris’
Constitutional Reform as a Remedy for Political Disenchantment in
(Springer, 2020). It is a provocative and timely exploration of
democratic discontents, disengagement and coherent law reform as
an effective
solution to systemic problems. The review notes the depth, cogency and eloquence
of that work by one of the nation’s
leading constitutional scholars and an
inspiring teacher.
The Student Section of this issue of
Canberra Law Review
contribution from one of the Law School’s undergraduate students. Rumesha
Kashif’s ‘Murders With Missing
Bodies: Evidential Construction of
Prosecutorial No-Body Murder Cases’ is a commendably detailed engagement
with homicide prosecutions
where the victim’s body has not been found.
