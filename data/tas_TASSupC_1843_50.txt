McMinn v. Bennett [1843]
costs, recovery of, attorney, action to enforce costs
Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land
Montagu J., 12 December 1843
Hobart Town Advertiser
, 19 December 1843
Mr. Macdowell stated that he appeared for Mr. Washington McMinn, an attorney of the court, who sought, by this action,
to recover the amount of his bill of costs, for work and labour done, in his professional capacity. The plaintiff, amongst other
things, had been engaged in two actions, in which the defendant was concerned. He should prove the reasonableness of the bill by
Mr. Midwood, who was engaged with Mr. Rowlands for the other parties in the suits. During a period of the time over which the bill
of costs extended. Mr. McMinn kept no clerk, and he was not therefore in a position to prove some of the items in the account. But
that the work had been done, and at the defendant's request, there could be no doubt; as these items were as necessary for carrying
on the suits as were those which he should prove by Mr. Midwood. Another witness would prove the delivery to the defendant of the
account, and of his afterwards promising to settle it. If the defendant had intended to dispute any of the items, he should have
sent the bill to the Master of the Court, that it might be taxed. This he had not done, and it would be no answer for him to come
forward now and say that the bill should have been taxed. He (Mr. Macdowell) should not hesitate to the most searching investigation
of the bill, item by item, but he apprehended that the assessors would not sit in that box to tax the bill.
Mr. Midwood proved the items for 61
19s. 10d, the amount claimed.
Mr. Henderson (the plaintiff's clerk) served a copy of the bill on the 22nd of July, on the defendant, at the "Stream
Mill," on the Old Wharf. He deposed that the items mentioned in the copy now produced, were those for which this action is brought.
His Honor thought that the original, and not a copy, should have been produced.
Mr. Macowell cited a case in which it had been decided by Lord Ellenborough, that where there were two contemporary sittings,
counterparts of each other, if a counterpart was produced he was ready to receive it.
Mr. Henderson's examination continued - Witness called upon the defendant with a cognovit, after the sittings in last
term, and about six weeks after the delivery of the bill. He told him, if he would sign it, the action would be withdrawn. He refused
to sign the cognovit, but said he would pay Mr. McMinn as he could; that he should soon be able to pay a considerable part of the
Mr. Sorell produced the original summons in an action brought by the plaintiff against James Bennett.
The Judge briefly summed up. The bill had been delivered to the defendant as it stood; and he had admitted it by promising to pay
the money six weeks after the delivery of the bill. He thought they should assess damages for the plaintiff; all the work had been
done. Damages for Â£62 19s. 10d, less Â£5 received on account.
