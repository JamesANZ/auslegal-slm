Report on Reference Concerning the Meaning of 'Publication' in the Copyright Act [1984] CLRC 3
Report on Reference Concerning the Meaning of“Publication” in the
Senator the Hon. Gareth Evans, Q.C., Attorney-General of
Report by Committee on reference concerningthe meaning of “publication” in the
You have referred to the Committee the question of whether any changes
should be made to the meaning of “publication”
in paragraph 29(1)
, especially in connection with
sections 31
of the Act.
2. A sub-committee was appointed to assist the Committee in its
deliberations. The sub-committee prepared a short discussion paper
identified the following two issues.
3. First, given that the Act presently provides in
that the “copyright in literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works
includes the exclusive right “to publish the work”,
should that
right be unlimited or be limited to first publication? Secondly, would an
Australian court interpreting
hold, as the House of Lords held
recently in relation to the equivalent U.K. provision, that the right of
publication is a right
only to first publication, because paragraph 29(1)
(a) is not a definition of “publication” for the purposes of
section 31?
The “Committee is Recommendations
4. In relation to the policy issues the Committee is unanimously of the
opinion that the right to publish conferred by
of the Act should be
the, right to publish the work for the first time in Australia; in other words,
the right to make public in
Australia a work that has been previously
unpublished here.
5. Concerning the legal interpretation issue, the Committee is not unanimous. Most members of the Committee (including
the Chairman)
consider that an Australian court would find that “to publish the work”, in sub-paragraphs 31(1) (a)
(ii) and 31(1) (b)
(ii), means “to publish the work for the first
time in Australia”. Those members are of the view that paragraph 29(1)
(a) would be construed as a provision dealing with the subsistence
of copyright, and not a definition provision. However, some members
concerned about the difference in language between the provisions considered by
the House of Lords and the Australian provisions
and believe that sufficient
doubt exists to warrant legislative amendment.
6. Thus, to put-the matter beyond any doubt,
could be amended by the addition of the words “for the first
time” after the word “work” in sub-paragraphs
(ii) and 31(1) (b) (ii). However, the Committee agreed that, given the
relationship between
sections 31
of” the Act, final consideration
of any amendment of
should be reserved until work has been completed by the Committee on its reference
on the importation provisions in
sections 37
of the Act.
7. Dealing with the policy issues first, it was noted in the discussion
paper that an unlimited publication right would allow the
control the supply of any reproductions of his work to the public, whether the work be new
or second hand. This
would amount to a de facto distribution right which, it
seems to the Committee, would have some most undesirable consequences. For
example, mere sale of a copy of a work would be an infringement of copyright even
though the copy had been made with the copyright
permission.
8. On the other hand if the right to publish is limited to first publication the copyright owner may control further uses of his
work through the exercise of his other exclusive rights. They include the right to reproduce, to broadcast and to perform
9. In relation to the legal issue, the House of Lords decision referred
to above is Infabrics Limited v.. Jaytex
[1982] A.C.I. It was
decided in that case that the expression, “publishing the work”, in
s.3(5) (b) (and by inference
s. 2(5) (b)) of the Copyright Act 1956 (U.K.))
means making public in the United Kingdom a work hitherto there
unpublished; (per
Lord Scarman [1982] A.C. at p. 25). At the heart of the decision in the Infabrics case was the conclusion that s.49
of the United
Kingdom Act (which contains provisions not dissimilar from those
of s.29 of the Australian Act) was not a definition section as the
Appeal had thought >but rather a provision dealing with the subsistence of copyright; see
Lord Wilberforce at p. 15 and
Lord Scarman at p. 22. Had the House of
Lords thought that s. 49 was a definition section, it would have been in
agreement with the
Court of Appeal that the words, “publishing the
work”, in s. 3(5) (b) meant publishing the work, not only for the first
time, but on
subsequent occasions as well.
10. The reference to this Committee is entitled “Definition
of Publication”. We have assumed this to be a reference to
29 of the Australian Act. But central to the question of how
the Act-should be-amended, if it is “desired that
be, is the problem of whether s. 29 is a definition or is,
instead, to be construed in the same way as S. 49 of the United
Act. If it is, there is no problem. If, on the other hand, it is a definition section, as the refere~ce implies,
the undesirable
consequences referred to in paragraph 7 would result, and the
Act would need to be amended.
11. Most members of the Committee (including the Chairman) are of opinion that no amendment to the Act is necessary in order to make
clear that the right to publish is the right to publish for the first time. In
their view the Act here would receive the same
construction as has the United
Kingdom Act. But they acknowledge that the matter cannot be regarded as being
within the realm of
absolute certainty. Firstly, there are differences of
language between s. 49 of the United Kingdom Act and s. 29 of the Australian
Act. Moreover, although the House of Lords was unanimous in its decision that s. 49 of
the United Kingdom Act was not a definition
section, there is no gainsaying that
a reading of the two leading speeches delivered by Lord Wilberforce and Lord
Scarman shows
that their Lordshipsdid not reach their conclusion easily.
The contrary view of the Court of Appeal was not discarded. . -
It must therefo~e-”b~-acknowledged, both because of the
differences between the United Kingdom and the Australian sections
judicial ‘disagreement in the United Kingdom, that the question cannot be
regarded as foreclosed in Australia.
12. Nevertheless, most members of the Committee (including the Chairman)
are of opinion that the likelihood is that, if the matter
were put to the test,
the outcome would be the same here as it was in the United Kingdom. This opinion is held largely
because the
outcome is in general accord with well understood principles of
Kingdom and
the 1968 Act-here. There is no warrant for taking the view that the legislatures in the two countries intended to ‘work
fundamental change in those principles. As Lord Wilberforce said ([1982] A.C. at
p. 16), “All through the history of copyright,
common law and through the legislation over 280 years,
there has been the well known contrast between unpublished works
and ,’ published works. The distinction lies it the roo”ts of the
13. Flowing from that view-is a further consideration of great importance
which arises because of the provisions of s. 32 of the
Act. It makes different provisions in relation to the subsistence of copyright depending upon whether a work is
unpublished
or published. It is a section which needs to be looked at in
conjunction with s. 29. The importance of s. 32 is that it proceeds
on the basis that the conditions for the subsistence
of copyright in the case of published work will be different from those which
apply in order that copyright may subsist in an unpublished work. That is a
strong pointer to the exclusive right to publish the
work in S. 31 being limited to a right
to publish it for the first time. This was a matter relied upon by Lord
Wilberforce and Lord
Scarman; see pp. 17 and 23 to 24 and SS. (2)(i) and (ii)
and (3) (iii) of the United Kingdom Act which make provisions comparable
14. Despite those considerations, those who are. of the opinion
that the Australian Act would receive the same construction as the
Kingdom Act concede that the matter is not without doubt.
15. The Committee has given some thought to whether or not it should be
provided in any amending Act that the amendment is not to
be understood as
working any change in the existing law. On the whole, the Committee is of the
view that such a provision should
be” included but would like the views of
the Office. of Parliamentary Counsel to be taken into account in making a final
16. – It remains to say that the Committee gave consideration to
whether or not the amendments to s.31 should not say, “for
the first time
in Australia”. It was felt, however, that there might then be a problem in
relation to the importation provisions
contained in s5. 37 and 38. As mentioned
in para 6, this is something upon which the Committee may have a clearer view
after it has
completed its consideration of the importation reference.
17. Finally it should be recorded that the Committee did not invite
submission on the matters before it, though this course of action
was proposed
in the sib-committee’s discussion paper. It was considered not to be
