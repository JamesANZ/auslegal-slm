Crimes Act 1900
Guilty to manslaughter [7]
Original sentence
24 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 16 and a half years
Guilty Plea Discount
N/A, however entitled to a 1 year reduction on the total sentence to
reflect the offender's conduct in facilitating the administration
of justice by
disclosure of his defence in advance of the trial, narrowing the issues to be
placed before the jury and his economic
use of the court's time [6], [9], [111].
Aboriginality of Offender
Offender was represented by the Aboriginal Legal Service. No specific
reference made to Aboriginality of offender, but reference
made to cases
considering Aboriginality [21] – [26].
Aboriginality of Victim
No specific reference made to the Aboriginality of the victim, but
references to him being a member of the offender's own community,
who no doubt
lived similar lives of social deprivation, alienation and dysfunction [66].
Factors arising from Offender’s Aboriginal Background Considered
by the Court
Lengthy criminal
history, commencing at age 15 and including a conviction for murder and serious
offences of violence, including rape
and assault [51] – [55], [66],
Early history of
social deprivation, including:
lack of decent
housing conditions, including access to running water and electricity;
itinerant family
exposure to
alcohol and violence; [56] – [59], [61], [64], [65];
Long history of
alcohol abuse [61]; and
employment [61].
On 18 February 2013, groups of citizens of Wilcannia (a small, close-knit
community [75]), gathered at the home of the offender and
his de facto partner,
Teegan Jones (the sister of the victim), to mourn the loss of a young local man
[10]. Around midnight, the
offender, who had "had a great deal to drink", became
agitated and attempted to get people in his home to leave [11]. In the course
this activity, he became engaged in an argument with Ms Jones and assaulted her
by throwing a chair at her which hit her in her
Sometime around 1:30am on 19 February 2013, the offender began arguing with
his two sisters and became abusive towards them, "fuelled
to a significant
degree by a combination of grief and alcohol" [13]. Ms Jones and Alice Shepherd,
the offender's half-sister and
de facto partner of the victim, then became
involved in a physical fight [15]. The victim intervened on behalf of Ms
Shepherd and
the offender intervened on behalf of Ms Jones, each intervening on
the part of their respective de facto partners [16]. The offender
and Mr Jones
then came into conflict [16].
The victim threatened and abused the offender and said words to the effect of
"don't be a big man mooch", "I'll bash you" or "I'll
bash the both of you", with
some witnesses hearing that the bashing would take place the next day [19].
Almost immediately the offender
ran approximately 20 or 30 metres across the
road to his house and retrieved a kitchen knife [20]. The victim went to the
house and retrieved a large iron bar that was part of a trampoline [21].
The victim and the offender approached one another outside the premises [22].
The victim "struck a glancing blow on the offender"
and in swinging the bar the
victim fell to the ground unarmed [24].
The offender immediately jumped on top of the victim and stabbed him once in
the chest [25] before grabbing the iron bar and swinging
another blow at the
victim, making contact with his arm [26]. The offender then ran from the scene.
The victim was taken by ambulance
to hospital where he was pronounced dead, with
the death caused by a single stab wound to the heart [27].
The offender surrendered himself to police at 2pm on 19 February 2013 [1] and
took a 'cooperative stance' during the trial which was
conducted efficiently and
quickly and in which the offender made a number of formal admissions [6].
Aboriginal Customary Law issues raised
Not applicable.
Aboriginal Cultural Practice or kinship issues raised
specifically considered, but Hamill J:
considered the
offender's upbringing, noting that he moved between his grandmother, mother,
foster father and aunt (and foster mother)
from time to time and moved with
their families from town to town; [56]
noted that the
offender had murdered two members of his own community, who had no doubt lived
similar lives of social deprivation,
alienation and dysfunction; and
account the grief and the harm suffered by the victim's mother, sisters and
partner as an aspect of the harm done to the
community in the sentencing.
Sentencing Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background
of the offender and/ or indicators of disadvantage
Hamill J allocated a section of the judgment to the offender's family and
personal history, noting the affidavits and reports prepared
go "a very long
way" to explaining how the offender came to spend a large amount of his late
adolescence appearing before the Children's
Court [55].
His Honour accepted as fact that the offender's history, including:
the offender
being moved between family members from time to time, who themselves lived an
itinerant lifestyle shifting from town
to town; [56];
drinking a lot; [56]
the offender's
family often lived in tin houses with no running water or electricity; [56]
the offender
ceasing schooling at 13 years old; [57];
the offender
drinking alcohol daily from 14 years old; [61]
the offender
being exposed to alcohol and some violence from an early age [61];
the offender's
lack of gainful employment [61].
This background gave rise to a consideration by Hamill J of the recent High
Court cases
Bugmy v the Queen
[2013] HCA 37
Munda v Western
[2013] HCA 38
, which each "gave rise to similar and profound
issues concerning the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders who come from deprived,
dysfunctional
and marginalised backgrounds" [62].
His Honour acknowledged that "the High Court has emphasised that offenders
are not to be treated differently because of their ethnic
or racial background."
[62]. Hamill J also noted the High Court's ruling in
that the same
method of analysis must be applied in sentencing Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal
offenders and that there is no warrant
to take into account the high rate of
incarceration of Aboriginal people when sentencing of an Aboriginal offender
[62]. As stated
"To accept that Aboriginal offenders are in
general less responsible for their actions than other persons would be to deny
people their full measure of human dignity" [53].
Justice Hamill considered the High Court's observation in
Bugmy v the
that "an Aboriginal offender's deprived background may militate the
sentence that would otherwise be appropriate" noting that the
same principle
applies to a non-Aboriginal offender, quoting additional passages from
Hamill J held that the offender's personal history of social deprivation and
early exposure to alcohol and violence explained to a
significant degree his
criminal history and "the unfortunate path that his life had taken" [64]. His
Honour stated that while both
general and personal deterrence remain relevant
[66], he accepted that the offender was not an 'ideal vehicle' to send messages
general deterrence, quoting a passage from
in support of this
contention [64].
Hamill J noted that he had been conscious of, and had applied, the provisions
of s 31A(5AA) of the
Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act
; he had not taken
into account the offender's self-induced intoxication as a mitigating factor,
however the offender's history of
deprivation and exposure to alcohol and
violence were so intrinsically connected to his "current predicament" that his
moral culpability
was diminished [65]. These matters were considered as
relevant to a proper assessment of an appropriate and just sentenced in
with the principles set out in
Hamill J contrasted this with the fact that the offender had murdered two
members of his own community and the impact on that community
(via the victim
impact statements) on the small and isolated community of Wilcannia by the
needless cutting short of the victim's
life and that his disabled child would
now be much more reliant upon the resources of the state for future care [66]
Justice Hamill noted that the fact that the evidence showed a lack of
planning and premeditation, a lack of intention to kill and
the substantial
degree of provocation were all significant matters of mitigation [48]. His
Honour also noted that the offender had
shown insight into his action,
demonstrated remorse and genuine empathy and had acknowledged responsibility for
the death of the
victim at all stages during the proceedings [95], [100].
However his Honour noted that it was impossible rationally to conclude
offender had good prospects of rehabilitation, particularly if he returned to a
similar pattern of drinking [53], [96].
Prospects of future dangerousness was
taken into account to slightly increase the sentence [111].
Relevant passage(s):
"I accept that the offender's personal history
of social deprivation and early exposure to alcohol and violence explains to
significant
degree his criminal history and the unfortunate path that his life
has taken." [64]
"However, his history of deprivation and exposure to
alcohol and violence are so intrinsically connected to his current predicament
that his moral culpability is diminished. These matters are relevant to a proper
assessment of an appropriate and just sentence in
accordance with what has
fallen from the High Court in both
