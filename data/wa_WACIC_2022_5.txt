offender entered a plea of guilty to the charge of assault public officer on
27 August 2019 in relation to the offence. I was
therefore satisfied a
proved offence as defined in the Act was constituted. The facts of the offence
were set out in the police
incident report as follows:
At about 4.30pm on Monday 15th July 2019 the accused was at her home address of
[redacted], High Wycombe. Paramedics and Police
were called to the address by
the accused's carer.
The accused had begun to self-harm and cut herself
causing injury.
Due to the nature and known behaviour of the accused, Constable "A" was waiting
in an adjacent alley in case the accused fled the
house. At the time police had
justified cause for concern as the accused was a child in need of immediate care
and psychiatric attention.
As police and paramedics entered the front door, the
accused jumped a side fence into the alley and observed Constable "A" who was
full uniform.
The accused attempted to flee but was apprehended and detained by Constable
She attempted to escape by resisting and kicked Constable "A" to his groin
causing immediate pain and discomfort.
The accused was successfully detained and conveyed to the Perth Children's
Hospital by police for assessment.
On Wednesday 17th of July 2019 the accused was arrested at her home and her bail
of the Act, a notice was issued to the offender advising her
of the application and inviting her to make any submissions in relation
within 21 days of that letter. She was advised an award may be made to the
applicant in which case the State may seek to recover
some or all of that amount
from her. No response was received to that notification.
support of his application, the applicant provided a victim impact statement
dated 7 December 2021. He described himself as being
born and raised in
Australia and of Japanese heritage maternally. Prior to the incident he had no
concerns in relation to his culture
or heritage. He is a serving police officer
who joined the police force when he was 20 years of age (he was
25 years at the time
of the victim impact statement) and enjoyed being a
police officer. He also held an Associate Degree in Criminology and Justice.
He said at the time of the offence he was 23 years of age and was assaulted
by the applicant, a person who he was trying to help.
He was a junior police
officer working at a Police Station at the time. This was the first time he had
been assaulted and it took
him by surprise. He was also racially abused which
is supported by the contents of his statement to police dated 21 July 2019.
said he had previously helped the offender and was responding to a call from
St John Ambulance officers requesting assistance. The
possibility of being
assaulted did not cross his mind. Whilst he was attempting to provide
assistance he said the offender assaulted
him and made derogatory comments about
his ethnicity. He said as a result of the assault he suffered pain and
discomfort in his
groin and stomach for many weeks and was unable to go about
his daily activities. He said he did not take any time off work or obtain
medical treatment as he was too embarrassed and ashamed. The assault shocked
him and affected him emotionally. Since the incident
he had been doubting his
career choice and felt anxious when responding to jobs or speaking with the
public. He is fearful of being
assaulted again particularly if he lets his
guard down which affects the way he goes about his work activities. He said his
life was also affected. He felt anxious and less motivated. He is
short tempered and less enthusiastic, negatively affecting his
relationship with
his friends and family. His relationship with his partner ended shortly after
the incident, she telling him he
had changed and describing him as being hard to
connect with. He said he no longer plays soccer or team sports because he found
it hard to enjoy the activities. He felt vulnerable, on edge and anxious on his
was satisfied the applicant suffered physical injury by way of immediate pain
and discomfort to his groin which lasted for a period
of time. I was satisfied
the applicant had a psychological reaction to the incident which was enduring in
nature. Whilst the applicant
did not seek medical attention, I was satisfied
these injuries were suffered by the applicant on the information provided in his
victim impact statement and as outlined in the incident report and pursuant to
section 18(2)
of the Act determined this information informed me in the
manner I saw fit as to the applicant's injuries. Therefore, I awarded
applicant the sum of $1,500 for his physical and incident related psychological

and (c) of the Act I prohibit publication of any particular
