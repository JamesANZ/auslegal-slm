SYMPOSIUM ON GOVERNING HIGH SEAS BIODIVERSITY
BIODIVERSITY BEYOND NATIONAL JURISDICTION: REGIMES AND
THEIR INTERACTION
Margaret A. Young* and Andrew Friedman
International efforts to better conserve the marine biological diversity of
areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) through a new
international legally
binding instrument
developing in a context of established norms and institutions. Existing regimes
already address specific marine sectors (such
as shipping), regions (such as
fishing in the South East Atlantic), species (such as whales), and even
underlying customary international
law and territorial concepts (including the
boundaries of the “high seas”
States have agreed that they will not “undermine” these existing
frameworks.
contextualize this commitment within the fragmentation of international law and
the interaction between regimes.
We argue that international law-making should not be overly restricted by
deference to existing competencies and mandates, which are
asymmetrically supported. An inclusive and adaptive approach to existing and
future institutions is vital in the ongoing
quest for integrated and effective
oceans governance.
A New Implementing Agreement and Relevant Regimes
Negotiations for the new instrument will address the marine biological diversity
of areas beyond national juris- diction with a focus
marine genetic resources, including questions on the sharing of benefits,
measures such as area-based man- agement tools, including
marine protected
areas, environmental impact assessments and capacity-building and the transfer
of marine technology.
These elements reflect a long-standing recognition of unsustainable ocean use
and management in areas that are not subject to the
sovereignty of coastal
states. Negotiations will thus elaborate a text that aims to improve on the

of existing global, regional, and sectoral organizations

subject to some measure of regulation by an existing constellation of
agreements, instruments, and decisions relating to ocean
governance. These
include sectoral organizations, such as the International Maritime Organization
(IMO) and the International Seabed
Authority, as well as regional fishery
management organizations (RFMOs), such as the International Commission for the
Conservation
of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the South East Atlantic Fisheries
Organisation (SEAFO), and the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management
Organisation (SPRFMO). Those organizations exist alongside bodies more focused
on promoting and protecting the ecosystem within a
region, such as the
Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).
Other organizations address specific
species, like the International Whaling
Commission and the conference of parties to the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES). If the trade of certain fish products is
restricted in order to, for example, deter illegal fishing within or outside
national jurisdiction, the World Trade Organization (WTO) is also relevant.
Still other regional organizations, including the Regional Seas Organizations
promulgated under UN Environment’s “Regional
Seas” programme,
and oceanic conservation organizations such as the Convention for the Protection
of the Marine Environment
of the North-East Atlantic’s OSPAR Commission or
the Sargasso Sea Commission, may have broad mandates that cut across sectors,
but with varying degrees of binding authority or responsibility for areas beyond
national jurisdiction.
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) calls for cooperation in areas beyond
national jurisdiction, and the CBD’s conferences
of the parties have
called for the expansion of marine protected areas. The CBD’s new Nagoya
Protocol provides a model for
fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising
from both the use of genetic resources that originate within countries’
sovereign limits and the use of traditional knowledge associated with genetic

to note that

perils of the literature on regime interaction is the essentialization or even
fossilization

“Regimes” here are taken as “sets of norms,
decision-making procedures and organisations coalescing around functional
issue-areas
and dominated by particular modes of
behaviour, assumptions and biases.”

are not fixed, and an approach to regime interaction dependent on ex ante
determinations of organizational competence risks
entrenching positions instead
of opening them to contestation and evolution. Yet we also consider that the
mapping of different regimes
can aid in understanding complexity, especially
when asking how a new regime will affect existing obligations.
Strengthening of Obligations
The new agreement is likely to create additional obligations for states that are
parties to existing agreements. For example, if
the new instrument implements
area-based management tools, the subsequent identification of a new marine
protected area, sanctuary,
or fishery closure could prevent a state from fishing
in areas otherwise regulated by an RFMO to which it belongs, including accessing
opportunities to reach its RFMO-mandated fishing quota. New environmental
protections or protocols could discourage a state from
sponsoring mining in
seabed areas under the International Seabed Authority’s jurisdiction. New
rules for ships on speed, noise,
routing, or other measures in specific marine
protected areas could restrict vessels’ activities in ways that may vary
the standards issued by the IMO.
This situation can be generalized as an anticipated strengthening of obligations
rather than as an imposition of conflicting obligations.
By analogy, when states
began to list marine species under CITES to restrict harmful trade, they did not
undermine the Food and Agriculture
Organization’s mandate to promote the
conservation and man- agement of marine resources, but instead recognized the
support conservation and management through multiregime measures. This
enhanced the cooperation and coordination between secretariats,
even when some
states were members of one regime but not the other.
The following table depicts a nonexhaustive list of states that have been active
in the BBNJ negotiations (spe- cifically, those
that made written submissions to
the preparatory committee sessions), alongside a corresponding list of those
states’ membership
in selected intergovernmental organizations.
Organizations include multilateral organizations addressing the global impact of
sector and regional organizations addressing the impacts of one or more
activities in a geographic area. While patterns of membership
multilateral organizations over- lap closely (as indicated in the first two
columns), in regional and sectoral organizations
they are less aligned (as
indicated in the next four columns). This is to be expected, but it also shows
the complexity of achieving
coor- dination through existing organizations with
disparate memberships.
momentum for the new instrument is justified in part by its potential role in
encouraging coordination among regimes without parallel
memberships.

The new agreement will also coexist with customary international law, which
applies to states regardless of their particular treaty
commitments. Relevant
customary obligations include the general duty to protect and preserve the
marine environment, which is also
codified in UNCLOS,
as well as a corpus of
“due diligence” obligations.
Indeed, there is already a
robust set of environmental obligations in areas beyond national jurisdiction.
What is lacking is implementation
and compliance by states, and effective
institutional support and oversight. The new agreement can enhance
implementation by providing
a venue for interregime learning and
cooperation.

made on behalf of regional groups (e.g., the Caribbean Community and the African

of the European Union, which is listed, these regional groups

The 28 member states of the European
Union are members of the IMO, but membership is not open to intergovernmental
organi- zations
such as the Union itself, which instead has observer status.

The Creation of a New Institution
A new organization’s substantive responsibilities could extend to
deployment of management tools, including designation of
marine protected areas
and promulgation and review of environmental impact assessments. It could also
administer frameworks for marine
genetic resource access and benefit sharing,
capacity building, and technology transfer. Alongside these responsibilities,
the organization
would play an important role in coor- dinating and cooperating
with existing bodies.
The work of such an organization requires significant resources, which partly
accounts for differences of views about the desirability
of empowering a
standing institution such as a conference of the parties (COP)
or focusing on ad hoc
coordination within existing bodies and frameworks.
BBNJ preparatory committee
delegations have coded their preferences regarding these institutional models
through oblique references
to their support for “regional,”
“global,” or “hybrid” models of implementation, or by
to draw distinctions between “light” or “heavy”
Existing regimes illustrate such characteristics. The WTO might serve as an
example of a “heavy” and “global”
regime, as it oversees
a detailed set of covered trade agreements that rest upon international
standards from other regimes such
as food safety. WTO committees engage in
ongoing scrutiny of the standard-setting process, thus exercising a degree of
over exogenous standards. In trade disputes, panels and the Appellate
Body make authoritative interpretations of these exogenous
standards, even if
they have not been supported by the entire WTO membership. The authority of
exogenous norms is thus contingent,
rather than absolute.
This example is relevant to the
BBNJ context especially if compliance with the new agreement is linked to the
provisions for compulsory
dispute settlement in UNCLOS Part XV.
A rather weaker, yet still regularized, institutional form is the COP, which
manages its relationships with existing bodies through
decisions. The United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change COP, for example, has issued
“safeguards” to ensure
that forest-related emissions reduction
policies “complement or are consistent with the objectives of national
forest programmes
and relevant international conventions and
agreements.”
incentive for states to provide information about their compliance with these
safeguards comes from their desire to attract
climate finance,
which is a different scenario
from the one currently envisaged for BBNJ.

Weaker still are ad hoc arrangements for coordination. For example, the United
Nations Fish Stocks Agreement
encourages states to apply guiding principles and approaches within
existing bodies without engag- ing in systematic or binding norm
development.
Attempts to develop a coherent
set of practices through pro- cesses such as the joint meetings of the five tuna
RFMOs initiated in
Kobe, Japan, in 2007, have not progressed. Whichever model
states settle on for BBNJ, institutional design in the context of regime
complexity will require the ongoing inclusion of perspectives on shipping,
fishing, seabed mining, and so on. As David Caron noted,
situations of
complexity require us to adapt and learn.
While states and international
organizations provide important perspectives and expertise, the participation of
a broader epistemic
community and civil society enhances learning and
information-sharing.
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) do not have strictly representative
functions, they provide networked ideas and knowledge
that are essential to
governance.
Part of the ongoing assessment of regime interaction in the BBNJ context will
therefore incorporate the activ- ities of NGOs in the
development and ongoing
implementation of the new agreement. This participation may give rise to
concerns by states, who wish to
retain control over law-making. Questions of
legitimacy should not be ignored, and there are cases in which certain
stakeholders
are rightfully excluded from regime interaction.
But the credentials of NGOs in
the BBNJ negotiations are supported by an open charter,
a scientific foundation, and a
public interest orientation. Ongoing inclusion of NGOs will be important for the
new institution’s
States likely will establish a new international regime to conserve and sustain

Preparatory work has reinforced a commitment not to undermine existing global,
regional, and sectoral regimes.
Such a commitment reflects the considerable intellectual, political, and
human investments in existing institutions and practices.
Equally important,
however, is the recognition that the needs of the international community change
and that regimes are not fixed.
The instinct to divvy up existing competences
and mandates must be checked, at the very least, by the recognition that the
of regimes is unlikely to fully overlap. More broadly (and more
compellingly, from a pluralist perspective of international law),
developments
in scientific understanding and environmental concerns will require laws and
institutions to evolve and change. The
BBNJ negotiations are an important moment
for the international community to promote a dynamic, inclusive, and adaptive
to oceans governance.
