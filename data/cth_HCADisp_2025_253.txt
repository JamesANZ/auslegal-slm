Chiha v The King [2025] HCADisp 253 (6 November 2025)
[2025] HCADisp
applicant requires an extension of time within which to seek special leave to
appeal from part of the judgment of the Court of
Criminal Appeal of the Supreme
Court of New South Wales (Price A-JA and Rigg J, Garling J dissenting),
which dismissed the applicant's
appeal against conviction in relation to two
counts: participating in a criminal group contrary to
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) and manufacturing a large commercial quantity of a
prohibited drug contrary to
Drug Misuse and Trafficking
application for special leave to appeal has insufficient prospects of success.
It is not in the interests of the administration
of justice, either
generally or in this case, for special leave to appeal to be granted. It would
therefore be futile to grant the
extension of time that is sought.
leave to appeal is refused.
