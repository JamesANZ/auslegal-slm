The advice I wish I was given
By Bree Knoester
You can’t always be the best but you can be the best prepared. Be kind.
Be humble. It’s okay to work late – sometimes
opportunities arise at
those hours. Find your niche. Work-life balance is a fiction. Build your
This is the advice I wish I was given as a young lawyer and the advice I now
offer. This edition of
is an excellent collection of articles
which will serve as a resource for new lawyers looking for diversity of
opinions, representation
and experiences. The contributors offer honest and
reflective commentary on the good and the bad of legal practice. I was honoured
to be asked to share my thoughts on the theme. Let me now unpack my potentially
controversial advice.
The law is competitive and adversarial and, with this at its core, it is not
surprising that lawyers engage in battles to be the cleverest
or write the most
caustic correspondence. The desire to be ‘the best’ is an undeniable
motivator for many. But, for almost
everyone, unachievable.
In 20 years I am yet to see preparation outperform any other trait and
preparation is something we can all master. If you have, for
example, reviewed
the background of the case, prepared a file note ready to record the details of
the meeting or asked questions
to obtain key pieces of information, this will
leave a positive and lasting mark on others.
Be kind. Save feisty letters for last resort. Lawyers have long memories.
Good long-term working relationships with your opponents
is the best way to
obtain positive outcomes. I still remember the mistruthful, the overly
aggressive and the keyboard warriors. I
also remember the lawyers who treated me
with respect and as an equal – even as a new lawyer.
Be humble. And with this, be inquisitive. Ask questions, listen, help, take
in all the advice you can, then filter it down to what
works for you.
Working late. A controversial topic. Hours can be dictated by outside
influences – the court, opponents, time zones. In private
practice, the
law is rarely a 9–5 job. Flexibility is necessary for wellbeing but also
to ensure that you do not miss out on
opportunities.
I am not advocating for unrelenting hours in a dark office. I am suggesting
that accepting that this can be necessary at times may
be helpful. Some of the
best learning experiences come when working with a new lawyer on an urgent
asbestos case or in the throes
of a trial. It would be disappointing to miss out
because of a rigid adherence to working specific hours only.
Let me turn to work-life balance and why this is a fiction. Work can be a big
part of your life and that is okay – especially
if, like me, you love
being a lawyer. To suggest that anything outside of work is your
‘life’ can create a pressure to
always have equilibrium.
I propose that we drop the ‘work’ from ‘work-life
balance’ and strive for balance, which does not always mean
equilibrium.
For example, when working with terminally ill clients, my hours can be long. But
when those matters settle, I take the
time to leave earlier, do the pre-school
drop off, watch
The Real Housewives of New York City
or go for a long
walk with a friend. The aim is not for the scales to always be equally balanced,
as this can create a sense of failure
when work-life and home-life are not
perfectly aligned. My suggestion is if your emotional/energy cup is emptying,
make time to fill
Lastly, build your community – be this in your firm, or out, or a
combination. The profession can, at times, be tough. Finding
your people to
reach out to is the best professional self-care you can do. I find it a great
compliment when a lawyer I used to work
with reaches out to brainstorm a
conundrum, or a barrister answers the phone when I need a second opinion on a
case. Be available
to colleagues, create opportunities for community building
and reach out to those you would like to be in your community. Who knows
that coffee may be the start of a new opportunity.
