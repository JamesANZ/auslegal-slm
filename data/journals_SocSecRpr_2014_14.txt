Disability support pension: income test; assessment of income protection
payments; effect of assignment of income protection policy
WATSON and SECRETARY TO THE DSS
Decided: 29th May 2014 by K. Bean and N. Manetta
Watson had received a disability support pension since 2001, after treatment
for a brain tumour left him with per-manent restrictions
on his ability to work.
Between 1996 and April 2009 he operated a business as a sole trader providing
financial advice. He also re-ceived
regular payments under an income protection
policy he had with AXA.
In April 2009, Watson began to carry on his business through a company of
which he was sole director and shareholder. He provided
financial advice
services as the company’s employee. In October 2009, he assigned the
benefit of the income protection policy
to the company and payments under the
policy were then made to the company. The assignment was a gift in so far as no
consideration
passed to Watson.
Since 2001, Watson’s rate of disability support pension had been
affected by his business and the income protection payments.
Watson appealed the
assessment of his income. In April 2011, a Centrelink complex assessment officer
de-termined that for the purpose
of calculating his rate of pension, his income
between 1 October 2009 and 10 June 2011 was:
(i) attributed income of $32,032.00 pa, which represented income protec-tion
payments made to the company;
(ii) net rental income of $3887.50 pa, which he received from the company;
(iii) salary income of $3302 pa, paid to him by the company.
The decision was affirmed by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) and
Watson then appealed to the Admin-istrative Appeals Tribunal
(AAT). The AAT used
its power to remit matters back to a decision-maker for reconsid-eration in
Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975
and, when no
Centrelink officer reconsidered the matter within the allowed time, the matter
resumed at the AAT on the basis that a
Centrelink officer had reaffirmed the
decision (subs.42D(7), 42D(8)).
Social Security Act 1991
(Cth) (the Act), income
received by a company can be treated as an individual’s personal income
for the purpose of assessing
their rate of disability support pension under
of the Act. The Act calls this ‘attribution’ of
Relevantly, the scheme allows the Secretary to determine that certain amounts
are to be excluded as income from any attribution (ss.1207Y
(2), 1207Y (3)). It
also allows certain losses and expenses to be deducted from the company’s
income if it carries on a business
or holds an investment (s.1208B).
In applying this scheme to Watson’s financial arrangements, the AAT
considered, in substance, two specific questions:
(i) Was it appropriate to treat the income pro-tection payments received by
the company, as well as rent and salary payments to Watson,
as income and
aggregate them for the purpose of calculating his rate of pension or did this
involve ‘double counting’?
(ii) Should the income protection payments received by the company be offset
by the company’s losses or outgoings?
Decision and reasons
The double counting issue
The starting point was the fact that the company’s main income was, in
reality, the income protection payments assigned to it
by Watson. It then used
some of that income to make the rental and salary payments to him.
At the hearing, the Secretary finally acknowledged this reality and conceded
that aggregating these three amounts involved inappropriate
counting’ of a portion of the income support payments as those payments
were, in reality, the source of the rental
and salary payments.
The Secretary then made a further concession that an amount equivalent to the
rent and salary amounts should be determined to be ‘excluded’
s.1207Y of the Act.
Watson, for his part, conceded that the income payments to the company should
be otherwise treated as though his own; that is, attributed
to him under
These concessions effectively disposed of this issue.
The allowable deductions from the income protection
payments issue
Watson’s position was that he should only be attributed with the net
amount of the income protection payments after allowing
for the company’s
outgoings. He had previously litigated this argument as far as the Federal Court
and lost. The relevant provision
allowing sole traders to deduct losses or
outgoings is s.1075 of the Act, which only permits deductions against income
the business’. The Federal Court found that the income
protection payments were not income from the business and therefore
Watson argued that this reasoning no longer applied, as he now carried on his
business as an employee of the company.
The Tribunal decided that the Federal Court’s earlier reasoning still
applied. As the income from the income protection policy
was not derived from
the financial advice business the company operated, the company’s losses
or outgoings could not be deducted
from it. In this respect, s.1208B of the Act
(the applicable provision for attribution of company income) was not materially
from s.1075 of the Act.
Formal decision
The Tribunal set aside the SSAT’s decision. It remitted the matter to
Centrelink for redetermination of Watson's income in light
Secretary’s concession that certain amounts should be excluded from
Watson’s attributed income. It otherwise affirmed
decision in so far as it found that the gross amount of income protection
payments should be assessed.
