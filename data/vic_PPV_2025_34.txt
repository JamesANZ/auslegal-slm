Executive summary
Bendigo Planning Scheme Amendment C270gben (the Amendment) seeks to implement
the recommendations of the following documents:
Golden Square
Structure Plan (Structure Plan)
Golden Square
Urban Design Framework (UDF)
Golden Square
Heritage Study – Stage 2, Volumes 1 and 2 (Heritage Study Stage
Together these plans promote urban renewal of underutilised
land, create employment opportunities and encourage new and diverse infill
housing, while ensuring the protection of Golden Square’s valued heritage.
Undertaking development and implementation of these
documents together has
allowed for a balanced approach towards different, sometimes competing, planning
policy objectives.
In summary, the Amendment proposes to:
update existing
local planning policies relating to settlement, activity centres, urban forest
interface, landscaping, location of
residential development, business,
industrial land supply, public transport, freight links, social and cultural
infrastructure, open
space and public land to incorporate relevant strategies
from the Structure Plan
insert new local
planning policies relating to walking, cycling, health facilities and cultural
facilities to incorporate relevant
strategies from the Structure Plan
rezone land from
the General Residential Zone (GRZ) and Industrial 1 Zone (IN1Z) to Industrial 3
Zone (IN3Z)
update heritage
provisions by:
- removing the
Heritage Overlay from 31 places
- revising the
precinct boundaries for four heritage precincts
- applying the
Heritage Overlay to 12 new heritage precincts
- applying the
Heritage Overlay to 32 individually significant heritage places
Neighbourhood Character Overlay (NCO) from properties with an existing or
proposed Heritage Overlay
apply the Design
and Development Overlay, Schedule 34 to properties within the Golden Square
Neighbourhood Activity Centre
operational provisions to introduce incorporated and background documents, new
maps and revise further strategic work clauses
to reflect the work undertaken as
part of this Amendment.
The Amendment was exhibited between 15
August and 16 September 2024. 20 submissions were received in response to
public exhibition,
with six either in support or raising no objection to the
Amendment. One submission was withdrawn. Of the 13 other submissions,
raised issues not related to heritage matters and 11 raised concerns with
proposed revisions to heritage provisions (mostly site
During the Directions Hearing, Council advised it had identified that several
potentially affected parties were not directly notified
during exhibition of the
Amendment. Council decided to provide notice to the affected owners and provide
them with an opportunity
to lodge a submission prior to the Panel Hearing. The
Panel Hearing was rescheduled to allow for this to occur. No further
submissions
to the Amendment were received.
Strategic justification
The strategic justification for the Amendment is
established through the Structure Plan, UDF and Heritage Study Stage 2.
The Amendment will assist in implementing a vision for Golden Square which
facilitates revitalisation and growth in a manner that
respects and complements
its valued heritage character.
General issues
Panels have consistently found issues such as
property values and maintenance costs are not relevant when considering whether
meets the threshold of local heritage significance to apply the
Heritage Overlay. Planning Practice Note 1: Applying the Heritage
(PPN1) does not include building condition, building maintenance costs and
housing affordability as criteria for assessing
whether to apply the Heritage
Overlay. There is nothing in this Amendment which would warrant departure from
that position.
PPN1 notes that when introducing the Heritage Overlay, a Council should
consider whether it is necessary to provide assistance and
advice to affected
property owners, including access to a heritage adviser or other technical or
financial assistance. Council has
indicated this type of assistance is
Heritage Precincts
Mackenzie Street Precinct (HO954)
The Heritage Overlay should not be applied to 296 or 294 Rowan Street, Golden
Square because they are Non-contributory properties
at the edge of the precinct,
and their redevelopment would not impact the surrounding heritage fabric. These
properties should remain
in the Neighbourhood Character Overlay.
Old Violet Street Precinct (HO957)
Categorising 30 Honeysuckle Street, Bendigo as a Significant property in the
Old Violet Street Precinct is not justified because it
does not meet the
threshold of Local Significance on its own or satisfy one of the Hercon criteria
at the local level. It should
be categorised as Contributory.
The Heritage Study Stage 2 should be corrected to ensure all categorisations
in the mapping and schedules align with citations.
Garden Gully Residential Precinct (HO951)
It is appropriate to remove outbuilding and fence controls in the Heritage
Overlay Schedule from 96 Rowan Street, Bendigo because
the driveway gates are no
longer of heritage significance.
State Rivers and Water Supply Commission Residential Precinct (SRWSC
Precinct) (HO948)
The application of the Heritage Overlay to the SRWSC Precinct is justified
because it meets the threshold of Local Significance under
the following
Criterion A
(historical significance) as a planned post war government development
demonstrating two tiers of employee housing, through
the brick and timber
Criterion E
(aesthetic significance) based on the presentation of the dwellings and street
tree plantings as intact streetscapes with
unifying front granite fencing
Criterion F
(technical significance) as an example of prefabricated post war housing
manufactured in local SRWSC workshops.
It is appropriate to amend
the Statement of Significance as proposed by Council (Document 40) to improve
It is appropriate to apply the Heritage Overlay to 2 Kurrajong Street and 501
High Street, Golden Square as part of the SRWSC Precinct
as the properties
contribute to its heritage significance. However, it is not appropriate to
apply tree controls at 2 Kurrajong
Street because the identified trees are not
original plantings.
Trees on private land, where tree controls are proposed to apply in the
Heritage Overlay Schedule, should be reviewed regarding their
significance if views of the tree were obstructed as identified in the Tree
Study (trees 183, 184, 185, 195, 196, 197, 198
Outbuilding and fence controls are appropriate at 501 High Street as the
original garages contribute to the heritage significance
of the Precinct.
It is appropriate to remove reference to subdivision in the Statement of
Significance and allow subdivision applications to be considered
Individual heritage places
Girton Grammar School, 83-119 Mackenzie Street,
Bendigo (HO990)
The Statement of Significance for 83-119 Mackenzie Street, Bendigo should be
amended to more accurately describe the property and
its significant
These changes should be in accordance with Council’s Part B version of
the Statement of Significance (Document 28.1), but further
modified to:
add information
indicate that
most likely the half of Glendure House facing Don Street was built first
(c1868-71 with an earlier core) and the half
facing Vine Street built in
It is not appropriate to introduce a new category,
‘historical interest’, and apply it to elements of a place in the
of Significance for 83-119 Mackenzie Street, Bendigo.
References to the term ‘historical interest’ should be removed
from the Statement of Significance.
The citation in the Heritage Study Stage 2 should be amended accordingly.
130 High Street, Bendigo (HO986)
The Heritage Overlay should be applied to 130 High Street, Bendigo as a
historically significant example of commercial development
which occurred on the
principal roads outside the central district of Bendigo in the early twentieth
The Statement of Significance for 130 High Street should be amended to:
remove reference
to Criterion B (rarity) from ‘How is it significant’ as the clock is
not an original feature
construction date of the shop from 1866 to 1902
add a list of
elements that do not contribute to the heritage significance of the place
remove reference
to the early clock as a significant element.
The citation in the
Heritage Study Stage 2 should be amended accordingly.
40 Mackenzie Street West, Golden Square (HO978)
The exhibited Statement of Significance for 40 Mackenzie Street, West Golden
Square should be amended to more accurately describes
the evolution of the
hotel’s construction, including elements that are not significant (being
the opaque glass in some lower
sash windows) and noting the replacement
The importance of the hotel to the past mining community should be described
as part of Criterion A (historical significance) and
not Criterion G (social
significance).
The citation in the Heritage Study Stage 2 should be amended accordingly.
Golden Square Fire Station, 260 High Street, Golden Square (HO965)
It is appropriate to remove the bell and hose drying tower as significant
elements from the Statement of Significance for 260 High
Street, Golden Square
as they were not part of the original fabric of the Fire Station.
The Statement of Significance should be revised to remove reference to the
Fire Station still being in use.
The social (associative) significance of the place should be reassessed now
the Fire Station has ceased operation, and if this is
no longer relevant this
reference should be removed from the Statement of Significance.
The citation in the Heritage Study Stage 2 should be amended accordingly.
24 Booth Street, Golden Square (HO962)
The Statement of Significance for 24 Booth Street should be amended to:
remove reference
to the weatherboard additions as significant elements of the building
clarify the
original door is identifiable as a former opening and not a current door
clarify the
building is ‘largely’ unaltered.
The citation in the
Heritage Study Stage 2 should be amended accordingly.
Existing Rowan Street Precinct (HO11) and 46-48 Old Violet Street,
The streetscapes along Old Violet Street, Olive Street and Pitt Street
exhibit features that continue to reflect their history. Development
streetscapes could influence the heritage significance of the streetscapes and
proposed adjoining precincts.
Properties along Old Violet Street, Olive Street and Pitt Street, including
46-48 Old Violet Street, Bendigo, should not be removed
from the Heritage
Overlay and should be included in the Old Violet Street Precinct (HO957).
46-48 Old Violet Street should be recommended for inclusion in the Victorian
Heritage Inventory.
Tree 147 identified in the Golden Square Heritage Tree Study 2021 should be
included in the Heritage Overlay as part of the Old Violet
Street Precinct
It is appropriate to review all statements of significance to ensure
boundaries shown in the significant tree aerial mapping aligns
with the precinct
boundary mapping and to remove notations (green dots) illustrating significant
trees which are outside the precinct.
Non-heritage issues
2-20 Chum Street, Golden Square
Clause 11.03-1L should not be reworded to include the southern part of 2-20
Chum Street, Golden Square within the St John of God Activity
Centre because the
Structure Plan does not specify this outcome.
It is not necessary to include a place-based policy in Clause 11.03-6L and
strategies are appropriately captured under thematic headings
throughout the
Planning Policy Framework.
A new strategy should be included under ‘Centre specific
strategies’ at Clause 11.03-1L to encourage redevelopment of
centres in accordance with the Structure Plan.
Clause 16.01-1L should be reworded to better reflect the intended future
development of the land at 2-20 Chum Street.
Update the Golden Square Structure Plan to be consistent with the wording of
Clause 16.01-1L in relation to land at 2-20 Chum Street.
Panton Street, Golden Square
Land on Panton Street between Maple and Laurel Streets should not be rezoned
from Commercial 1 Zone to a residential zone as part
of this Amendment. The
approach to progress the rezoning of this land through proposed Amendment
C293gben is supported.
The Amendment will assist in implementing a vision for Golden Square which
facilitates revitalisation and growth in a manner that
respects and complements
its valued heritage character. The Amendment should proceed subject to
addressing the more specific issues
raised in submissions as discussed in this
Recommendations

Panel recommends that Greater Bendigo Planning Scheme Amendment C270gben be
as exhibited subject to the following:

Greater Bendigo, January 2022) as background documents
Schedule to Clause 74.02 (Further strategic work) to delete references to Golden
Square studies included as part of this
proposed amendment.
(ii) The subject land
The Amendment applies to land in Golden Square and
parts of surrounding suburbs of Bendigo, Ironbark and West Bendigo described in
Chapter 1.1 (i).
1.2 Background
The Structure Plan
outlines a vision for revitalising and transforming Golden Square over time
guidance on residential development on key sites to promote medium density
setting out
directions to enhance industrial areas while contributing to industrial land
outlining a
vision for a vibrant town centre
identifying
active transport improvements.
The UDF, prepared in conjunction with
the Structure Plan, sets out an integrated vision for the Golden Square Town
Centre, future
Station Precinct and strategic redevelopment sites.
The Heritage Study Stage 2 was prepared at a similar time as the Structure
Plan and was an input into its development. The Heritage
Study Stage 2 forms
the justification for changes to the application of the Heritage Overlay in
Golden Square, and sought to:
review existing
heritage precincts in Golden Square, assess their cohesion and whether adjoining
areas should be included in the precincts
statements of significance to accord with current standards
significance of several places not currently included in the Heritage
Council tabled a report prepared by Ms Howe (Document
19.1), Council’s Heritage Advisor, responding to Panel Direction 9a(iii)
which requested:
an explanation of the approach to the heritage studies, with regard to the
Council’s report of 16 December 2024 (page 132) which
this framework has evolved since the previous studies were
” and confirming the version and date of Heritage Study relied
on for the Amendment.
The report provided a comprehensive overview of the background and
methodology undertaken in preparing the Heritage Study Stage 2.
Ms Howe explained the Eaglehawk and Bendigo Heritage Study, 1993 (EBHS)
formed the basis for the existing application of the Heritage
Overlay, and while
considered excellent by the standards of the time used a very different set of
criteria to the current approach.
Since the EBHS was prepared there have been
changes to what is considered significant in a heritage context and there is now
prescriptive approach to the application of the Heritage Overlay set out
The Heritage Study Stage 2 was preceded by the Heritage Gap Analysis, 2019
(Gap Study) which identified the need for review of areas
included in the EBHS.
This included revisiting places graded D (contributory significance), C
(individual significance) and above,
in recognition that appreciation of
heritage typologies has shifted since 1993. It also recommended a thorough
review of all precincts
to ensure statements of significance aligned with
current standards or were prepared where there wasn’t one.
The next step was the preparation of the Chronological and Thematic History
of Golden Square, 2019 (Heritage Study Stage 1). This
comprised a review of
existing literature with a focus on Golden Square and preparation of a
chronological history identifying key
events in development of the suburb. It
identified additional places for investigation and assessment.
The Heritage Study Stage 2 was prepared by Council officers, alongside
heritage consultants, Minerva Heritage, Homewood Consulting
and Context (GML).
It recommended:
expanding three
existing heritage precincts into adjoining areas
breaking up the
Rowan Street heritage precinct (HO11) into smaller, more discrete precincts
applying the
Heritage Overlay to several new precincts and individual places
removing the NCO
from properties proposed for inclusion in the Heritage Overlay
statements of significance for precincts to accord with current standards
(noting several precincts did not have existing
statements of significance)
removing the
Heritage Overlay from areas of precincts considered to have low integrity or
undertaking a
city-wide study of post-war heritage sites.
The Heritage Study Stage
2 provided the strategic justification for the heritage provisions proposed in
the Amendment.

the basis for Council’s submission to
the planning Panel.
Following the Directions Hearing on 18 February
2025, the Panel confirmed it is required to consider all submissions referred to
including issues Council considers resolved with submitters. The Panel
advised the merits of the proposed changes considered to
resolve the
submitters’ concerns will be assessed by the Panel and included in the
Panel Report.
The Panel makes no comment on matters raised in the submission that was
(iii) Exhibition of the Amendment and postponement of Panel
During the Directions
Hearing on 18 February 2025, Council advised it had recently identified that
several potentially affected parties
were not directly notified during
exhibition of the Amendment. Specifically, while the occupants were notified,
the owners of six
proposed for inclusion in the Mackenzie Street Precinct (HO954) were not
provided with direct notification of the Amendment.
Initially, Council proposed to make post exhibition changes to the Amendment
to remove these properties. However, subsequently Council
decided to provide
notice to the affected owners and provide them with an opportunity to lodge a
submission before the Panel Hearing.
Council wrote to the Panel and requested
the Panel Hearing dates be rescheduled to accommodate the additional notice time
The Panel wrote to all parties on 26 February
2025 to advise:
it agreed it was
appropriate to ensure all potentially affected landowners had the opportunity to
make a submission and be heard by
availability constraints associated with changing the timing for the Panel
Hearing the Panel for this matter had been reconstituted
Directions Hearing would be held online on 29 April 2025 to confirm arrangements
for a rescheduled Panel Hearing.
On 2 April 2025, Council advised
that further notification had been undertaken, and no submissions were received
from the affected
On 24 April 2025, the Panel wrote to all parties to advise that due to
further availability constraints the Panel for the matter had
been reconstituted
a second time and it would be unable to commence the Panel Hearing until the
week commencing 2 June 2025. In
response, Council circulated proposed new
Hearing dates to all parties, commencing on 4 June 2025. A second Directions
Hearing was
held online on Tuesday 29 April 2025 where alternative dates for the
Hearing were discussed. It was agreed that the Panel Hearing
would commence on
Wednesday 4 June 2025. No party objected to the revised Hearing dates.
(iv) Parties to the Panel process, expert witnesses and
submissions resolved during the Panel process
Following the first Directions Hearing, six parties
were recorded as parties to the Panel process. At the second Directions
the Panel confirmed with Mr Rice that he also sought to become a party
to the process but did not wish to make an oral presentation
at the Hearing. Mr
Rice made a subsequent written submission to the Panel, which was circulated to
all parties on 21 May 2025 (Documents
25, 25.1 and 25.2).
Majex Pty Ltd and Girton Grammar School both initially indicated an
intention to call an expert witness in heritage. However, both
parties advised
the Panel before the Hearing they had reached resolution with Council about
their submissions (subject to changes
to the Amendment) and would no longer be
presenting an oral submission to the Panel or calling an expert witness.
Ophir Holdings Pty Ltd advised on 4 June 2025 it continued to support the
Amendment in principle, while identifying two outstanding
matters requiring the
further consideration of the Panel. It confirmed it intended to rely on written
submissions to the Panel and
would no longer be presenting an oral
submission.
Council clarified Ms Howe (Council’s Heritage Advisor) would give a
presentation as part of its submission but would not be
called as an independent
expert. Council called Ms Schmeder as an expert witness on heritage.
1.4 Site inspections
Panel undertook an accompanied site inspection of Girton Grammar School on
Tuesday 3 June 2025, with a representative from Girton
Grammar School and Ms
Tonney from Council in attendance.
Unaccompanied site inspections of other sites that were the subject of
submissions were also undertaken on 3 June 2025 and throughout
Golden Square
generally, including sites nominated by Council in the itinerary provided
(Document 26).
1.5 The Panel’s approach
The Panel has assessed
the Amendment against the principles of net community benefit and sustainable
development, as set out in Clause
71.02-3 (Integrated decision making) of the
Planning Scheme.
The Panel considered all written submissions made in response to the
exhibition of the Amendment, observations from site visits and
submissions,
evidence and other material presented to it during the Hearing. It has reviewed
a large volume of material, and has
had to be selective in referring to the more
relevant or determinative material in the Report. All submissions and materials
been considered by the Panel in reaching its conclusions, regardless of
whether they are specifically mentioned in the Report.

2.2 Strategic justification
(i) Evidence and submissions
Submissions
raising concerns with the Amendment were mostly directed to confined heritage
issues and there were no submissions questioning
the broader strategic basis for
the Structure Plan, UDF or the rationale for implementation of the Heritage
Study Stage 2.
Council submitted:
the Structure
Plan outlines a vision for Golden Square to revitalise the place over time
is complemented
by a UDF to guide use and development of the Golden Square Neighbourhood
Activity Centre and future Station precinct
the application
of the Heritage Overlay is required to protect the heritage values of precincts
and individual properties identified
updating and
strengthening heritage provisions in the Planning Scheme would conserve these
heritage places for present and future
the rezoning of
two areas to the Industrial 3 Zone would reduce the potential for land use
conflict and reflect existing uses.
Council submitted the
methodology used in the Heritage Study Stage 2 was rigorous and based on the
approach outlined in Planning Practice
Note 1: Applying the Heritage Overlay
(PPN1) and:
recognised Hercon criteria to assess the heritage value of places and
detailed comparative analyses to substantiate the significance of places and
statements of significance using the three-part format of ‘What is
Significant?, ‘How is it Significant?’
and ‘Why is it
Significant?’.
Council explained that after completing the
Heritage Study Stage 2, and publicly exhibiting the Amendment, Ms Schmeder, an
heritage consultant, was engaged to undertake a peer review of
submissions which raised heritage issues, Council’s proposed
response and
associated citations and statements of significance (Document 8c).
Council’s position on the Amendment at the
Panel Hearing incorporated Ms
Schmeder’s recommendations.
Council submitted the assessment of the heritage significance of places and
precincts in the Amendment was professional, thorough,
considered and
One submission questioned the more specific methodology for proposing to
remove properties from the Heritage Overlay. This is discussed
(ii) Discussion
The strategic
justification for the Amendment is established through the:
Golden Square
Structure Plan
Golden Square
Urban Design Framework
Golden Square
Heritage Study – Stage 2, Volumes 1 and 2.
Together these
plans promote urban renewal of underutilised land, create employment
opportunities and encourage new and diverse infill
housing, while ensuring the
protection of Golden Square’s valued heritage. Undertaking development
and implementation of these
documents together has allowed for a balanced
approach towards different, sometimes competing, planning policy objectives.
Considering the extent of properties affected by
the Amendment, there were very few submissions and these were mostly confined to
site specific issues.
The Amendment will assist in implementing a vision for Golden Square which
facilitates revitalisation and growth in a manner that
respects and complements
its valued heritage character.
(iii) Conclusions
For the reasons set out in this report, the Panel
concludes the Amendment:
is supported by,
and implements, the relevant sections of the Planning Policy Framework
is consistent
with the relevant Ministerial Directions and Practice Notes
is well founded
and strategically justified
should proceed
subject to addressing the more specific issues
raised in submissions as discussed in the following
3 General issues
chapter refers to issues which apply across more than one individual place or
(i) The issue
The issue is whether building condition, building
maintenance costs and housing affordability are relevant when assessing the
significance of an individual place or a precinct.
(ii) Evidence and submissions
Some submissions considered that applying the
Heritage Overlay would:
impact on housing affordability
ability of homeowners to maintain or update dwellings, with the cost of custom
renovations disproportionate to the value
of properties.
the Heritage
Overlay does not limit works for maintenance with a planning permit
the Victorian
Heritage Restoration Fund can assist with up to half of the cost of works
no permit is
required in accordance with Council’s Heritage Design Guidelines if
replacement is like-for-like
Council assists
applicants in selecting an appropriate design.
(iii) Discussion
Property values,
maintenance costs and building alterations are frequently raised in submissions
where a planning scheme amendment
is proposing to apply the Heritage Overlay.
Panels have consistently found these issues are not relevant when considering
a property meets the threshold of local heritage significance to apply
the Heritage Overlay.
The purpose of the Heritage Overlay is primarily to:
conserve and
enhance heritage places of natural or cultural significance
conserve and
enhance those elements which contribute to the significance of heritage
ensure that
development does not adversely affect the significance of heritage
There are other objectives in the Planning Scheme that
consider different matters, such as housing affordability. The Amendment also
proposes to implement the recommendations of the Structure Plan and UDF which
address other planning imperatives.
PPN1 does not include
building condition, building maintenance costs and housing affordability as
criteria for assessing whether to
apply the Heritage Overlay. It notes that
when introducing the Heritage Overlay a Council should consider whether it is
to provide assistance and advice to affected property owners,
including access to a heritage adviser or other technical or financial
assistance. Council has indicated this type of assistance is available.
(iv) Conclusion
The Panel concludes that
building condition, building maintenance costs and housing affordability are not
relevant when assessing
the heritage significance of an individual place or a

Street trees (English Elm) and native trees on both private and
public land, as shown on the map, have been identified as significant.
How is it significant?
The Mackenzie Street Precinct is of local historical, research potential
and representative significance to the City of Greater Bendigo.
Why is it significant?
Mackenzie Street Precinct is of historical significance as a typical
suburban area developed alongside mining areas. It demonstrates
the egalitarian
mix of upper and lower levels of society found on the Bendigo goldfield. The
precinct reflects the shifts in development
patterns from throughout the whole
gold era, from Victorian cottages, through the booms and busts that followed
into the short-lived
1930s revival. Street trees reflect this development
pattern, with English Elms lining the more formal street alignment at the
intersection
of Wade and Mackenzie Streets, but a variety of native trees
(Yellow Gum, Sugar Gum, River Red Gum and Red Ironbark) being found
in the more
meandering streets at the north of the precinct (Booth and Ophir Street). Sugar
Gums at 11a Ophir Street also contribute
to the heritage setting.
The Mackenzie Street Precinct is significant for the research potential of
the high number of highly intact or original sites throughout
the area, which
may yield information that contributes to the understanding of life on the early
goldfields.
(Criterion C)
The Mackenzie Street Precinct is significant as a representative sample of
a residential area developed on gold bearing ground to
provide housing for
miners and their families. The precinct has a more organic street pattern and
variation in size and alignment
of lots, as well as a broader period given the
subsequent subdivision of the former miners’ residency areas, but
similarities
of building scale and form provides a consistent sense of place.
(Criterion D)
(i) The issue
The issue is whether it is justified and appropriate
to apply the Heritage Overlay to 296 Rowan Street, Golden Square.

(ii) Background
In relation to 296 Rowan Street, Golden Square, the
Amendment proposes to:
Heritage Overlay (HO954) Mackenzie Street Precinct
categorise the
property as Non-contributory to the precinct.
(iii) Evidence and submissions
The landowner of 296 Rowan Street submitted the
Heritage Overlay should not be applied to the property because:
the dwelling is
only eight years old and of a modern construction and design
adversely affect the value of the property
numerous houses
in this proposed area do not have heritage significance.
landowner requested the current NCO applying to the property be retained.
After reviewing the submission, Council initially recommended the Heritage
Overlay be removed from 296 Rowan Street and the two adjoining
properties at 294
Rowan Street and 45 Booth Street because all three properties are located at the
edge of the precinct and categorised
as Non-contributory.
Ms Schmeder explained including Non-contributory properties (those with low
or no heritage value) in Heritage Overlay precincts is
a means of ensuring their
future redevelopment does not have a negative impact on the heritage
significance of the precinct as a
She agreed with removing the Heritage Overlay from 294 and 296 Rowan Street
on the basis that there are no Contributory or Significant
places facing Rowan
Street between Wade and Booth Streets and therefore removing these properties
would not have any undue heritage
Ms Schmeder did not agree with removing the Heritage Overlay from 45 Booth
Street because:
it forms part of
a long streetscape with many Contributory and Significant houses on both
building on the property is Non-contributory, it is sympathetic in scale and
design to surrounding heritage houses

Council agreed with Ms Schmeder’s analysis and revised its position to
recommend not applying the Heritage Overlay to 294 and
296 Rowan Street. It
noted the owner of 45 Booth Street did not make a submission to the
(iv) Discussion
The dwelling at 296 Rowan Street, Golden Square is
clearly of recent modern construction and does not contribute to the heritage
significance
of the Mackenzie Street Precinct (HO954). There is no
disagreement, that the dwellings at 294 Rowan Street and 45 Booth Street also
not in themselves contribute to the heritage significance of the precinct.
Ms Schmeder undertook a considered analysis of these Non-contributory
properties in terms of the potential impact of their redevelopment
precinct. The Panel agrees it is appropriate to remove 294 and 296 Rowan Street
from the precinct, but to retain 45 Booth
Street as a Non-contributory property
due to its key position within the heritage streetscape.
The NCO should be retained at 294 and 296 Rowan Street. Its removal was
based on guidance in PPN1 that the Heritage Overlay and NCO
should not be
applied to the same site. As it is not recommended the Heritage Overlay be
applied to the properties there is no reason
to remove the NCO.
(v) Conclusions and recommendations
The Panel concludes:
Heritage Overlay should not be applied to 296 or 294 Rowan Street, Golden Square
are Non-contributory properties at the edge of the precinct
redevelopment would not impact the surrounding heritage fabric.
NCO should be retained at 296 and 294 Rowan Street, Golden
The Panel recommends:

294 and 296 Rowan Street, Golden Square.

heritage setting for the precinct.
How is it significant?
The Old Violet Street Precinct is of local historical, research potential,
representative and aesthetic significance to the City of
Greater Bendigo.
Why is it significant?
The Old Violet Street Precinct offers a cross section of Early Bendigo
development, with many miners’ cottages and early houses
set alongside the
later infill Edwardian and Interwar development that took up land from the large
early allotments. The precinct
offers insight into settlement patterns from the
1860s to the 1940s, providing examples of workers housing throughout the
era” of Bendigo.
(Criterion A)
The Old Violet Street Precinct has research potential as the location of
early settlement in the area. Many of the sites remain largely
as they were in
the 1860s and there is the potential for archaeology to reveal details of how
early settlers lived and worked in
(Criterion C)
The Old Violet Street Precinct incorporates representative examples of
typical workers housing across Bendigo’s “gold
1860s miners’ cottages to Interwar bungalows, and provides a typical
example of the type of diversity of building
result of the characteristic settlement patterns across central Bendigo. Early
and original tree
plantings on both private and public land contribute to the
understanding of the heritage setting int he precinct.
The cluster of Federation houses at 73-77 Thistle Street are of aesthetic
significance as one of the few identified clusters of Federation
Greater Bendigo, demonstrating a range of features found throughout the period
and including transitional details seen
in nearby housing at 16-18 Honeysuckle
Street. The streetscapes are connected by the contemporaneous former St Ambrose
Hall at 168-170 Mackenzie Street.

The Heritage Overlay currently applies to 30
Honeysuckle Street as part of the Rowan Street Precinct (HO11). The Amendment
property from the Rowan Street Precinct (HO11) and add it to the Old Violet
Street Precinct (HO957)
categorise the
property as Significant to the precinct.
The Heritage Study Stage 2
defines the categories as:
Significant
a place that is of individual significance and satisfies at least one of the
Hercon criteria at the local level. Significant places
are often significant
independent of their context, but may also contribute to the significance of a
Contributory
a place that contributes to the significance of a heritage precinct, but is not
of individual significance on its own.
Non-contributory
a place within a precinct that does not contribute to the significance of the
(iii) Evidence and submissions
The landowner of 30 Honeysuckle Street submitted the
property should not be recategorised from Contributory to Significant
the original
miner’s cottage has undergone extensive renovations and cannot be viewed
as supporting Criterion A
one chimney has
been removed to allow for a skillion roofed kitchen
the addition of
the later Victorian extension (gable front) does not enhance (and could detract
from) the original cottage façade
or its classification as
Significant
there is no
evidence for Criterion C as the block has been subdivided and is no longer a
repository for archaeological potential
miners’ cottages in Honeysuckle Street are categorised as Contributory and
the aesthetic qualities of 30 Honeysuckle Street
do not exceed these
The submission supported categorisation of the property as
Contributory within the precinct, consistent with the Draft Golden Square
Heritage Study, April 2021.
For context, Council noted the property was identified with a C grading
(Individually Significant) in the EBHS and subsequently included
in the Rowan
Street Precinct.
Ms Howe explained that while an early draft of the precinct citation included
the property as Contributory, further comparative analysis
across both the
precinct and wider area changed the categorisation to Significant.
Council said categorisation of the property in the Heritage Study Stage 2 was
inconsistent between the precinct map and schedule and
this was an error.
Ms Schmeder noted a few inconsistencies in the Heritage Study Stage 2
regarding the categorisation of properties on the map and in
the schedules and
said it would be advisable to correct the report to prevent confusion amongst
readers in the future.
Both Ms Howe and Ms Schmeder presented additional assessments of 30
Honeysuckle Street at the Hearing, having regard to the Hercon
criteria upon
which the Old Violet Street Precinct is considered significant (Criterion A, C,
D and E) and including comparative
Ms Howe did not recommend any change to the categorisation of the property or
the Statement of Significance and concluded:
30 Honeysuckle Street is a largely intact example of an early miners’
cottage upgraded with the growth of Bendigo’s middle
class in the wake of
the quartz boom. It has been somewhat altered, but these alterations have not
diminished its significance. The
combination of mining origins and subsequent
middle-class alterations in a timber dwelling has not previously been captured
Heritage Overlay, elevating the significance of this site above that of
either a typical miners’ cottage or a similar 1880s
Ms Schmeder said both phases of the house illustrate the historical
significance (Criterion A) and representativeness (Criterion D)
of the precinct
as they are
“part of the ‘miner’s cottages and early
houses’ dating from the valued development period of ‘the
”. For this reason, the house clearly contributes to
the significance of the Old Violet Street Precinct.
To determine whether it met the threshold of Local Significance on its own
(and therefore could be categorised as Significant), comparative
analysis was
required. Ms Schmeder identified a small and distinctive group of houses in
(and next to) the Old Violet Street Precinct
displaying a clear two-stage
development during the valued periods and concluded that 30 Honeysuckle Street
is not one of the above-average
examples of this type. Ms Schmeder said:
The two Significant examples, 48 Shamrock Street (also noted by Ms Howe as a
comparator) and 120 Lily Street (across the street but
not formally part of Old
Violet Street Precinct) are far superior examples to 30 Honeysuckle Street. This
is the case in their materiality
– more expensive masonry, their design
and craftsmanship, and their overall intactness.
She did not agree there was evidence the property was individually
Significant for its research potential (Criterion C) due to the
subdivision of
the land and loss of backyard containing early outbuildings, particularly the
‘dunny’, which is often
valuable as a repository of archaeological
Ms Schmeder disagreed with Ms Howe’s assessment that the property would
be significant as a rare example of a timber miners’
cottage substantially
upgraded by later owners (Criterion B). She said it was not an above-average
example and would not meet the
threshold of Local Significance for rarity. Nor
did she agree there was “
any argument to mount that it is of aesthetic
significance
” (Criterion E).
Ms Schmeder concluded:
changes to the site, particularly subdivision removing the early outbuildings
from this block of land, 30 Honeysuckle Street
has a low contribution to the
research potential (Criterion C) of this precinct.
Overall, the
house has a medium level of intactness (that is, retention of original external
fabric), and appears to have medium-high
integrity (that is, retaining its c1889
external appearance). It is intact enough to illustrate its origins as a
miner’s cottage
with a Late Victorian addition, contributing to the
historical and representative significance of the precinct.
There is a group
of miner’s cottages in and adjacent to Old Violet Street Precinct that
demonstrate a two-stage development
during the valued period. Among them, 30
Honeysuckle Street is not an above-average example, so does not meet the
threshold of Local
Significance in relation to Criteria A or D.
Schmeder recommended:
30 Honeysuckle
Street to be Contributory, instead of Significant, in the Old Violet Street
Correct the Old
Violet Street Precinct map and ‘gradings schedule’ in the precinct
citation (in Vol. 1) to reflect the
final heritage statuses of all properties in
this precinct.
Council did not support changing the categorisation
of 30 Honeysuckle Street to Contributory but proposed to amend the heritage
for the Old Violet Street Precinct in the Heritage Study Stage 2 to
rectify errors identified by Ms Schmeder (noting the errors had
already been
corrected in the exhibited Statement of Significance).
(iv) Discussion
The comprehensive additional analyses prepared by Ms
Howe and Ms Schmeder for 30 Honeysuckle Street greatly assisted the
understanding of the significance of the property.
Both assessments clearly establish the property contributes to the precinct
in terms of its historical and representative value, and
reflects early
settlement patterns where miners were gradually displaced by people with no
mining association and original dwellings
altered as this occurred.
In considering whether the property is individually significant within the
precinct, the Panel notes Ms Howe distinguished the dwelling
from other examples
due to it being the only significant timber example representing the settlement
pattern. Ms Schmeder however,
considered the materiality of other dwellings,
such as more expensive masonry, along with their design, craftsmanship, and
intactness were elements that led to a higher level of significance.
The Panel supports Ms Schmeder’s position. An individually
significant
building must be a better than average example exhibiting the heritage values
significant to the precinct.
The Panel accepts Ms Schmeder’s evidence that the property does not
meet the threshold of Local Significance on its own in relation
to the Hercon
criteria A, C, D or E referenced in the Old Violet Street Precinct Statement of
Significance, or Criterion B, but rather
contributes to the historical and
representative significance of the precinct and should be categorised as
Contributory.
The Heritage Study Stage 2 should be amended to ensure all categorisations in
the mapping and schedules align with the Amendment citations
for the Old Violet
Street Precinct, and for all precincts in the study.
(v) Conclusions and recommendation
The Panel concludes:
Categorisation
of 30 Honeysuckle Street, Bendigo as a Significant property in the Old Violet
Street Precinct is not justified because
it does not meet the threshold of Local
Significance on its own or satisfy one of the Hercon criteria at the local
Honeysuckle Street, Bendigo should be categorised as Contributory to the Old
Violet Street Precinct.
Heritage Study Stage 2 should be corrected to ensure all categorisations in the
mapping and schedules align with the Amendment
recommends:

categorise 30 Honeysuckle Street, Bendigo as Contributory.

How is it significant?
The Garden Gully Residential Precinct is of local historical, research
potential and representative significance to the City of Greater
Why is it significant?
The Garden Gully Residential Precinct was established on land associated
with the Garden Gully United Mine following the closure of
the mine. The
development is typical of one type of re-purposing of mining land in the
mid-twentieth century as mine sites ceased
operation, opening up tracts of land
in the central Bendigo area. Occupants of the houses provide insight into the
shifting economic
base of Bendigo in the wake of mine closures, with increasing
numbers of white-collar workers moving to the centre of Bendigo.
The southern end of the Garden Gully Residential Precinct has significant
research potential, with unmapped traces of mining activity
in the backyards of
some properties. Investigation of these areas could yield further information on
the workings of the Garden Gully
United mine, and earlier independent workings
(Criterion C
The precinct is significant as a representation of the types of housing
produced in the lead up to and immediately following the Second
During this time, suburban residential designs evolved into the double fronted
brick veneer forms that would linger over
the next several decades, with slight
variations in external detailing to differentiate them from their neighbours.
This detailing
was then included in the front boundary fences and garages
attached to the houses, many of which remain intact in the precinct. The
cedar street trees are original plantings from the initial development of the
subdivision and are representative of a shift
away from exotic plantings and an
increased appreciation for native species that developed in the mid-twentieth
century. The
Deodar Cedar
at 89A Vine Street is an early or original

driveway gates as ‘Outbuildings or fences not exempt under Clause
(iii) Evidence and submissions
The landowners requested the outbuilding and fence
controls be removed from the driveway gates at 96 Rowan Street as they are in
process of replacing the gates. The new gates would match a proposed picket
style fence to increase security and functionality purposes.
Council supported the request and submitted this was necessary to support an
ongoing permit application aimed at improving accessibility
and upgrading of
features beyond practical restoration.
Ms Schmeder supported Council’s position and said while the gates are
likely original to the house, the rest of the fence is
gone and the gates are of
a common and utilitarian type (Document 8c).
Ms Howe noted the gates have since been removed.
(iv) Discussion
The Panel accepts Ms Schmeder’s evidence
regarding the gates, noting they are no longer in place. The significance of
is lesser due to the absence of the accompanying original fence and
their common type. Therefore, it is reasonable to not apply
the outbuilding and
fence controls to the property regarding the gates.
(v) Conclusion and recommendations
The Panel concludes:
is appropriate to remove outbuilding and fence controls in the Heritage Overlay
Schedule from 96 Rowan Street, Bendigo because
the driveway gates are no longer
of heritage significance.
The Panel recommends:
Amend the Heritage
Overlay Schedule to remove outbuilding and fence controls from the driveway
gates at 96 Rowan Street, Bendigo in

from this version of the report. Contact Planning Panels
Victoria to obtain a
complete copy of the report.
What is significant?
The contributory houses and garden plantings within the State Rivers and
Water Supply Commission Residential Precinct are locally
significant to the City
of Greater Bendigo.
Significant places:
- High Street:
Contributory places:
- High Street:
- Mimosa Street:
- Kurrajong
Street: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Street trees in Kurrajong Street (Brush
Cherry, Flowering Gum, Lilly Pilly) are contributory to the precinct.
How is it significant?
The State Rivers and Water Supply Commission Residential Precinct is of
historical (Criterion A), aesthetic (Criterion E) and technical
(Criterion F)
significance to the City of Greater Bendigo.
Why is it significant?
The houses at 495, 499, and 501 High Street, 1-6 Kurrajong Street; and 1, 3
and 5 Mimosa Street, Golden Square were constructed by
the State Rivers and
Water Supply Commission to house staff at the Alder Street Depot. The
contributory buildings in Mimosa and Kurrajong
Streets form a consistent
streetscape of intact single storey Post War dwellings with consistent setbacks
and complementary roof
forms and finishes. The few non-contributory buildings
are of a similar scale, except for the two-storey building at 1A Mimosa Street
and are not particularly intrusive. The extant houses of weatherboard and
corrugated iron construction were at least partly prefabricated
at the nearby
SRWSC workshops. The contributory houses in Mimosa and Kurrajong Streets are of
Historical significance as a reminder
of the post war housing boom as men
returned from service in WWII wishing to settle down into civilian life and
work, and the infrastructure
projects embarked upon by the State Government post
war. Of particular note are surviving original plantings and garden layout.
subdivision would destroy much of this, along with ambience of the
original layout of the estate. Street plantings are all original
especially in
Kurrajong Street.
(Criterion A)
The intact streetscapes within the precinct have been enhanced by all the
Kurrajong and Mimosa street houses being constructed to
two or three designs by
the SRWSC. The houses reflect post war austerity- comfortable but inexpensive,
with brick houses facing the
main road especially on corners. The three houses
facing High Street of red brick construction are of individual designs and
intended for more senior staff. Most retain original plantings of trees
and shrubs in their gardens, and original plantings of street
trees are extant
in Kurrajong Street and Mimosa Street. All properties except 495 High Street and
1 Mimosa Street retain an original
front fence comprised of a low stone wall.
These combine to give an aesthetic unity to the precinct that allows a clear
understanding
of the original scheme for the precinct.
The houses are of technical interest due to the method of their manufacture
and construction by pre-fabrication at the SRWSC workshops
in Golden Square,
using the least materials to create the most house, whilst maintaining a high
standard of finish despite shortages.
The fact that they were prefabricated in
the nearby SRWSC workshops sets them apart from the pre-fabricated buildings
imported from
England seen at Eildon and elsewhere.

(iii) Evidence and submissions
One submission
requested the Heritage Overlay not be applied to the SRWSC Precinct and
properties assessed for inclusion in the Heritage
Overlay on individual
Several concerns were raised that applying the Heritage Overlay was not
justified because:
it was based on
outdated Google Street View imagery and not a physical inspection
many features
cited as historically significant are now dilapidated or no longer existing, for
example 1 Kurrajong Street
the streetscape
is run down
it does not meet
the threshold for specified criteria (set out below).
Criterion A (historical significance)
It was submitted the SRWSC Precinct failed to meet
the threshold for Criterion A because the streetscapes are not more intact or
than other local examples (numerous photos were provided showing similar
houses in other areas of Greater Bendigo).
Ms Howe said the establishment of the SWRSC Central Plant Works in 1947, and
associated housing, was noted as an important development
for Bendigo in the
Heritage Study Stage 1.
Ms Schmeder acknowledged there were other streetscapes of early post-war
housing elsewhere in Greater Bendigo, but few were cohesively
planned government
developments like this one. Ms Schmeder said the reason for its historical
significance is encapsulated in the
following sentence:
The contributory houses in Mimosa and Kurrajong Streets are of Historical
significance as a reminder of the post war housing boom
as men returned from
service in WWII wishing to settle down into civilian life and work, and the
infrastructure projects embarked
upon by the State Government post war.
Council submitted many of the other examples referred to by the submitter
exhibit only single design weatherboard houses, whereas
the SRWSC Precinct
exhibits two tiers of worker / employee housing, with the brick residences
likely for more senior staff and the
timber residences for other employees,
further elevating the historical significance of this precinct.
Council submitted the examples provided are similar housing types but the
setting is less significant.
Criterion E (aesthetic significance)
It was submitted the Precinct fails to meet the
threshold for Criterion E (aesthetic significance) because:
properties retain the original front fence and what is remaining is so degraded,
restoration would be cost prohibitive and
require specially trained
existing sash
windows are rotten and decayed, many having been replaced with aluminium, and
restoration would be cost prohibitive
and disproportionate to the value of the
references to
original plantings are speculative and inaccurate.
Ms Schmeder said
the key attribute is the aesthetic unity created by repetitive housing types in
largely intact garden settings and
the granite front fences which provide strong
visual cohesion and aesthetic distinctiveness.
Ms Schmeder agreed:
three of the
properties no longer have their granite fence (495 High Street, 1 Kurrajong
Street and 1 Mimosa Street)
replaced original windows but generally within the original openings
1 Kurrajong
Street has undergone alteration and while this has negatively impacted its
heritage value, its overall form remains and
as it stands in a row of three,
once identical houses it continues to contribute to the significance of the
Council submitted the consistent and fine fences visually
tie the precinct together and set it apart from most other post-war
development.
Criterion F (technical significance)
It was submitted the Precinct fails to meet the
threshold for Criterion F (technical significance) because:
prefabrication technique used for the dwellings was widespread and does not
warrant special recognition
the provenance
of these dwellings is uncertain.
Ms Schmeder said the citation and
Statement of Significance unequivocally state the SRWSC built some of the
prefabricated houses,
that this is rare within the City of Greater Bendigo and
thus the technical significance of the precinct at the local level has been
demonstrated.
Council agreed the timber houses were a mass-produced type, noting this is
the nature of prefabrication in that it can be used in
a bulk manner. It said
the citation noted this housing model was used by the SRWSC elsewhere and it is
possible the SRWSC factory
produced the timber housing in the precinct, but this
would need to be determined by additional research.
Proposed changes to the Statement of Significance
Ms Schmeder recommended the Statement of
Significance be changed to:
note the loss of
the granite front fence at 1 Kurrajong Street under Criterion E
not include tree
controls for 2 Kurrajong Street (discussed at Chapter 5.3)
descriptive text from “Why” (Criterion A) to “What” to
clarify why the precinct is historically significant.
In closing,
Council proposed some further changes to the Statement of Significance for the
precinct to:
significant street trees on Figure 2
remove the word
‘contributory’ from the first sentence under ‘What is
significant’ to clarify it is not just
Contributory houses that are
significant (as a Significant place is also listed)
reference to original garages and front fences under ‘What is
significant’
reference to the date of construction of the houses under ‘Why is it
significant’
descriptive information from ‘Why is it significant’ so it is more
tailored and unnecessary content is deleted
Kurrajong Street from the list of places with an intact front fence
remove tree
controls from 2 Kurrajong Street (discussed at Chapter
(iv) Discussion
PPN1 states each place must include a statement of
significance that:
establishes the importance of the place
recognised heritage criteria
meets a minimum
threshold for ‘Local Significance’ for specified criteria.
Criterion A (historical significance)
The history of the SRWSC central plant in Alder
Street, Golden Square to Bendigo is set out in the citation and documented with
to newspaper articles and copies of titles. The relationship of the
SRWSC Precinct to the plant is illustrated in the diagram in
the Heritage Study
Stage 2, sourced from the Bendigo Sewerage Authority (refer to
SRWSC Precinct and the SRWSC workshop buildings in Alder
Street (Bendigo Sewerage Authority, undated)

Source: Golden Square Heritage Study Stage 2, Volume 2, page 31
The Panel considers the Precinct meets the threshold for Local significance
under Criterion A. While there are many other examples
throughout Bendigo of
weatherboard houses similar to those in Kurrajong and Mimosa Streets, this
Precinct is distinguished in its
historical significance as a planned post war
government development associated with a significant employer in town. Of note,
comprised two tiers of employee housing, illustrated through the brick and
timber dwellings. The stone fences clearly delineate
the extent of the Precinct
and tie it together.
Criterion E (aesthetic significance)
The Panel considers the Precinct meets the
threshold for Local significance under Criterion E based on the presentation of
the dwellings
and street tree plantings as intact streetscapes with unifying
front granite fencing.
Some of the buildings and fences are not pristine but the Panel immediately
noted the aesthetic cohesion of the Precinct upon site
inspection due to the
consistent granite front fences and uniformity of housing type and design. That
some of the fences no longer
exist detracts little from the Precinct as most are
still present and continue to provide visual unity.
The Panel notes Ms Schmeder’s observation that while several original
windows have been replaced this has generally been done
within existing
openings, and the Panel agrees the houses remain sufficiently intact to
contribute to the significance of the Precinct.
Issues of affordability and maintenance costs are discussed at Chapter 3 and
not repeated here.
The Panel is not convinced that all garden plantings are original and this is
discussed in Chapter 5.3. However, the Panel accepts
street trees are original
plantings and add to the aesthetic significance of the Precinct.
Criterion F (technical significance)
The Panel considers the Precinct meets the
threshold of Local Significance under Criterion F, as it has been demonstrated
least some of the houses were constructed in the SRWSC workshops in
Golden Square (refer
The Statement of Significance specifically mentions their construction at the
local workshops as a factor that sets them apart from
other prefabricated
dwellings imported from England.
The citation refers to photos held by the Rural Water Corporation Collection.
While it mentions that some photos were unable to be
accessed due to COVID-19
restrictions at the time of assessment, it contains one photo which clearly
refers to construction of dwellings
in Mimosa Street (refer
). This is sufficient evidence to
support the claim at least some buildings were manufactured locally.

The Panel agrees with Council’s proposed changes to the Statement of
Significance (as shown in Document 40) to improve clarity
as follows:
significant street trees on Figure 2
remove the word
‘contributory’ from the first sentence under ‘What is
significant’ to clarify it is not just
Contributory houses that are
significant (as a Significant place is also listed)
reference to original garages and front fences under ‘What is

reference to the date of construction of the houses under ‘Why is it
significant’
descriptive information from ‘Why is it significant’ so it is more
tailored and unnecessary content is deleted
Kurrajong Street from the list of places with an intact front fence
remove tree
controls from 2 Kurrajong Street (discussed at Chapter 5.3.2).
(v) Conclusions and recommendations
The Panel concludes:
application of the Heritage Overlay to the SRWSC Precinct is justified because
it meets the threshold of Local Significance under
the following criteria:
- Criterion A
(historical significance) as a planned post war government development
demonstrating two tiers of employee housing,
through the brick and timber
- Criterion E
(aesthetic significance) based on the presentation of the dwellings and street
tree plantings as intact streetscapes
with unifying front granite
- Criterion F
(technical significance) as an example of prefabricated post war housing with at
least some of the dwellings manufactured
in local SRWSC workshops.
appropriate to amend the Statement of Significance as proposed by Council
(Document 40) to improve clarity.

Overlay to 2 Kurrajong Street as part of the SRWSC Precinct as:
a Contributory
controls (front boundary fence) and tree controls (Peppercorn Tree, Red
Ironbark) activated
(iii) Evidence and submissions
The landowner objected to applying the Heritage
Overlay to 2 Kurrajong Street for the reasons set out in Chapter 5.2, relating
the SRWSC Precinct more generally.
It was submitted the Peppercorn Tree and Red Ironbark are not original
plantings and this can be confirmed by viewing Google street
images, with the
Ironbark less than 20 years old.
Ms Schmeder said a comparison of images from 2007 and 2023 in Google Maps
indicated that the trees are not original plantings. It
was noted that the
Golden Square Heritage Tree Study 2021 (Tree Study) included the following
comment in relation to both trees:
Limited inspection, tree view significantly
obstructed, all dimensions estimated.
Ms Schmeder concluded the trees did not contribute to the significance of the
Precinct and recommended that tree controls not be introduced
for these trees at
2 Kurrajong Street.
In response to the Panel’s question whether all trees nominated to be
included in heritage tree controls in the proposed SRWSC
Precinct should be
reviewed, Ms Schmeder said there would be value in reviewing all trees in the
Precinct and clarified that only
trees planted before 1980 would contribute to
the significance of the Precinct.
Council agreed it would be appropriate to review trees in the Precinct before
adopting the Amendment and submitted there were approximately
six trees which
would require review as they were not readily visible from the public realm.
(iv) Discussion
2 Kurrajong Street is a relatively intact example
of one of the timber dwellings constructed as part of the SRWSC Precinct. No
was presented that contradicts this assessment. As a Contributory
dwelling, it is appropriate to include 2 Kurrajong Street in the
SRWSC Precinct
and apply the Heritage Overlay to the property.
The two trees identified for the tree controls are not original plantings as
evident through images readily available online. The
tree controls should not
be applied to these trees.
The Statement of Significance refers to the ’garden layout’ and
’original plantings’ as important features
adding to the heritage
significance of the Precinct. The Panel notes from the Tree Study that a
’Significance Statement’
was provided for each tree. For the SRWSC
Precinct, several trees on private property were identified as:
This tree may be an early planting associated with property and precinct
Accompanied by a comment that inspection of the tree was limited with the
tree view ’significantly obstructed’ or
’obstructed’.
Excluding the trees at 2 Kurrajong Street, which have been confirmed as
non-original plantings, the Panel identifies eight trees where
the view of tree
was somewhat obstructed and considers it appropriate to review the significance
of the tree before finalising the
Amendment. This includes tree numbers 183,
184, 185, 195, 196, 197, 198 and 199. Proposed tree controls in the Heritage
should be updated following this review.
(v) Conclusions and recommendations
The Panel concludes:
is appropriate to apply the Heritage Overlay to 2 Kurrajong Street, Golden
Square as a Contributory place in the SRWSC Precinct
as it contributes to the
heritage significance of the Precinct.
appropriate to apply tree controls at 2 Kurrajong Street because the identified
trees are not original plantings.
finalising the Amendment, trees on private land where tree controls are proposed
should be reviewed to assess their heritage
significance if views of the tree
were obstructed as identified in the Tree Study (trees 183, 184, 185, 195, 196,
197, 198 and 199).
The Panel recommends:
Amend the Statement of Significance for the
State Rivers and Waters Supply Commission Residential Precinct as shown in
final version (Document 40).
Amend the Heritage Overlay Schedule to remove
tree controls from 2 Kurrajong Street, Golden Square in the State Rivers and
Supply Commission Residential Precinct (HO948).
Before finalising the Amendment, undertake a
review of trees 183, 184, 185, 195, 196, 197, 198 and 199 in the Golden Square
Tree Study 2021 to determine whether they are original plantings and
contribute to the heritage significance of the State Rivers
and Waters Supply
Commission Residential Precinct.
5.4 501 High Street, Golden Square
(i) The issues
issues are whether:
appropriate to apply the Heritage Overlay to 501 High Street, Golden Square as
part of the SRWSC Precinct (HO948)
outbuilding and
fence controls are appropriate at 501 High Street.
(ii) Background
The Amendment proposes to apply the Heritage
Overlay to 501 High Street as part of the SRWSC Precinct as:
a Contributory
outbuildings and fence controls (garage, front boundary fence) and tree controls
(Liquidambar) activated.
(iii) Evidence and submissions
The landowner of 501 High Street submitted that
while the importance of preserving the area’s heritage character was
understood,
the ability to subdivide the property should not be removed due to
the application of the Heritage Overlay.
It was submitted subdivision of the property was appropriate because:
many adjoining
properties have been subdivided
it is a corner
site with good access from High Street and Kurrajong Street
it would add to
the provision of smaller, more affordable land parcels in a desirable
it aligns with
Council’s broader urban development objectives to create more affordable
increase rate revenue and create local jobs during the construction process
increase the aesthetic appeal of the area and overall property
Council submitted it was appropriate to include 501 High
Street in the SRWSC Precinct and the Heritage Overlay does not prevent
subdivision
of the property. Ms Howe noted subdivision that has already
occurred in the Precinct and said this had not had a severe impact on
proposed precinct and would likely be generally in keeping with the
recommendations of the Heritage Design Guidelines.
The exhibited Statement of Significance included the following
statements:
Of particular note are surviving original plantings and garden layout.
Further subdivision would destroy much of this, along with
ambience of the
original layout of the estate.
Council proposed to remove the second sentence from the final version
Statement of Significance (Document 40):
Further subdivision would destroy much of this, along with the ambience of
the original layout of the estate.
The submission also raised health and safety concerns and submitted the shed
in the backyard has been assessed as containing asbestos,
is in a state of
disrepair and should be removed.
Ms Schmeder observed that upon site inspection the:
...surviving garages are consistent in form, with their hipped roofs, and
recognisable as an early element of the precinct. Many are
visible down the
two-track side driveways, contributing to the streetscapes of the precinct
Her written evidence included an early photograph showing the new development
in 1956 with a garage for each dwelling.

Ms Schmeder concluded that:
controls for the garages are appropriate and will signal their heritage value
and allow for negotiation of positive outcomes
where planning applications might
propose their alteration or demolition
the presence of
asbestos-bearing building materials does not impact upon the heritage value of
this and other original garages, and
is an issue that can be managed in future
without the assumption that full demolition is required.
(iv) Discussion
501 High Street is a relatively intact example of
one of the brick dwellings constructed as part of the SRWSC Precinct. No
was presented that contradicts this assessment. As a Contributory
dwelling, it is appropriate to include 501 High Street in the
SRWSC Precinct and
apply the Heritage Overlay to the property.
Subdivision that has occurred in the Precinct to date has had a minimal
impact on the Precinct. The exhibited Statement of Significance
discourage further subdivision due to its potential impact on original plantings
and garden layout. The Panel agrees it
is appropriate to remove reference to
this statement on the basis that the impact of a future subdivision on elements
of heritage
significance within a property can be appropriately assessed at the
time of a planning application. It should not be assumed that
subdivision of a
property would necessarily have a detrimental impact.
The Panel agrees the original garages contribute to the heritage significance
of the Precinct and it is therefore appropriate to include
additional controls
in the Heritage Overlay where garages are present.
(v) Conclusions and recommendation
The Panel concludes:
appropriate to apply the Heritage Overlay to 501 High Street, Golden Square as
part of the SRWSC Precinct as the place contributes
to its heritage
significance.
Outbuilding
and fence controls are appropriate at 501 High Street as the original garages
contribute to the heritage significance
of the Precinct.
appropriate to remove the following sentence from the Statement of Significance
and consider subdivision applications on their
merits at the time of
application:
Further subdivision would destroy much of this, along
with the ambience of the original layout of the estate.
The Panel recommends:
Amend the Statement of Significance for the
State Rivers and Waters Supply Commission Residential Precinct as shown in
final version (Document 40) to remove the sentence:
Further subdivision would destroy much of
this, along with the ambience of the original layout of the estate.

(ii) Background
The Heritage Overlay currently applies to 89-119
Mackenzie Street is currently as an individually significant place (HO172
identified as 105 Mackenzie Street, Bendigo).
The Amendment proposes to apply the Heritage Overlay to the site as an
individually significant place with a slightly amended boundary
in the south
The place does not currently have its own Statement of Significance or
The property contains Girton Grammar School.
(iii) Evidence and submissions
Girton Grammar School (the landowner of the site)
supported the objectives of the Amendment and requested several changes to the
of Significance and citation to clarify and more accurately reflect
the heritage values of the place.
Requested changes included:
Statement of Significance
former Bendigo

reference to “original” as it is unlikely the corrugated steel
roofing is original
- refine wording
for “pattern of openings” as not all are original or
significant
- clarify which

- remove or
clarify reference to “part of the southern wing” as it was built in
at least two stages (brick base and timber

School’s occupation of the site which

corrections to the plan and legend.
It was suggested a base plan be
prepared to show all buildings and landscape elements of significance.
Council sought advice from the heritage consultant who authored the citation
and consequently proposed several refinements to the
Statement of Significance
and citation to address the concerns raised in the submission. This included a
site plan clearly identifying
all elements contributing to the significance of
the place. These amendments were generally supported by the landowner.
The proposed changes to the Statement of Significance:
clarified most
of the points raised in the landowner’s submission
did not amend
reference to the stages of development for Glendure House.
Schmeder’s evidence responded to issues not resolved between Council and
the landowner before the Hearing. Ms Schmeder provided
a detailed review, which
included an analysis of the citation and a heritage assessment provided by
Girton Grammar School, prepared
by heritage consultant, Mr Peter Barrett,
(Document 21)
, and her own
research. In summary, Ms Schmeder concluded:
Glendure House
was constructed by 1858, then rebuilt/remodelled and extended several times in
1861, 1868, 1871 and 1876
likely the first stage of Glendure House faces Don Street while the later facade
(c1876) faces Vine Street, with both halves
Significant elements, but noted the
order in which the parts of the house were built is to some extent academic and
would be unlikely
to influence its future management).
Ms Schmeder
recommended the citation and Statement of Significance be amended to:
add information
indicate that
most likely the half of Glendure House facing Don Street was built first
(c1868-71 with an earlier core) and the half
facing Vine Street built in
add information
found in Mr Barrett’s report about works to the nineteenth century
buildings, particularly information about
the evolution of the heritage
buildings (to the citation)
rephrase the
following text in the Statement of Significance
The 1922 addition to
the Girton House
is of historical interest because it illustrates
contributes to the understanding of
the early adaptive use
and expansion of the school in this site following the relocation in 1916
Regarding the term ‘historical interest’, Council proposed to
include a definition at Section 2.6 ‘Gradings within
precincts’ of
the Heritage Study Stage 2. Ms Schmeder agreed the proposed definition accords
with the standard use in current
heritage practice, indicating “
whose heritage value
falls below
the threshold for statutory protection
(that is, not Contributory, not Significant)
”. Both the landowner and
Ms Schmeder suggested further refinements to the definition to be clear about
this position.
In response to a question from the Panel at the Hearing as to how this new
term ‘historical interest’ is different from
contributory or
non-contributory, Ms Schmeder explained it sits between them and illustrates
part of the history but applies to something
that doesn’t have sufficient
intactness to be worthy of protection. Ms Schmeder agreed it would be
introducing a new category,
but said such a feature would be officially
Non-contributory but this would signal to a landowner that there could be value
in interpreting
what was there.
The final version of the definition clarified that elements of
‘historical interest’ are not intended to have statutory
as follows:
These gradings may also be used to
significant
elements within a larger or more complex site listing, such
as a school. Some elements of such sites may be considered to have historical
interest, meaning that they provide evidence of the evolution of the site and
complement the site’s overall heritage value,
but do not themselves meet
the threshold for protection as significant
or contributory, and therefore do
not meet the threshold for statutory
protection.
Council supported these findings and submitted the outcome would be
consistent with the PPN1 and Heritage Study Stage 2.
(iv) Discussion
The Statement of Significance for 83-119 Mackenzie
Street, Bendigo should be amended to more accurately describe the property and
its significant features in accordance with further information provided by
Girton Grammer School and subsequent analysis by Ms Schmeder.
This will require
further changes in references to Glendure House than shown in the revised
Statement of Significance (Document
28.1). While the Panel acknowledges the
current agreement between Council and the landowner on the revised wording, it
this would be improved by the updates as recommended by Ms Schmeder
based on her further analysis and research, specifically to:
add information
indicate that
most likely the half of Glendure House facing Don Street was built first
(c1868-71 with an earlier core) and the half
facing Vine Street built in
The Panel has given much consideration to the proposed use of
the term ‘historical interest’ in the Statement of Significance.
PPN1 provides guidance on how to write a Statement of Significance. It
states that identification of ‘What is significant’
leave no doubt
features or elements that are significant about the place
can identify
elements that are not significant
may provide the
basis for an incorporated plan which identifies works that may be exempt from
the need for a planning permit.
The Panel does not agree the
proposed use of the term ‘historical interest’ is consistent with
PPN1. It may cause confusion
significance, notwithstanding the inclusion of a definition in the Heritage
Stage 2, which sits outside the Planning Scheme as a background
It accepts that when it comes to redevelopment proposals for more complex
sites with multiple buildings, such as a school, there is
likely to be a need
for some nuanced classification of the relative significance of various parts
within a site. However, the proposal
to use the term ‘historical
interest’ which has been clarified by Council to be used for elements that
are not significant
in a statutory sense, effectively introduces a new
sub-category that has no additional statutory function.
PPN1 recognises that planning is about managing the environment and its
changes. The purpose of the Planning Scheme is to provide
a clear and
consistent framework within which decisions about the use and development of
land can be made. While the Panel does
not dispute the specified features have
historical interest, if they are not significant in terms of needing statutory
protection,
then it would be more appropriate to discuss them in the citation in
the Heritage Study Stage 2 and not the Planning Scheme, or to
explicitly state
they are not significant elements. At present, the Statement of Significance
gives the impression they are significant
in some way, and this is very likely
to lead to confusion for a future permit application.
It may be appropriate to retain reference to these elements in the section
‘Why is it significant’ where it assists in
understanding the
evolution of the site and which parts are significant, however they should
clearly be identified as non-contributory
elements of the place.
The proposal to include a map which clearly identifies the different
buildings and trees on site referred to in the Statement of Significant
(v) Conclusions and recommendations
The Panel concludes:
Statement of Significance for 83-119 Mackenzie Street, Bendigo should be amended
to more accurately describe the property and
its significant features.
These changes
should be in accordance with Council’s Part B version of the Statement of
Significance (Document 28.1), but further
modified to:
information about the additional stages of development of Glendure House
- indicate that
most likely the half of Glendure House facing Don Street was built first
(c1868-71 with an earlier core) and the half
facing Vine Street built in
appropriate to introduce a new category, ‘historical interest’, and
apply it to elements of a place in the Statement
of Significance for 83-119
Mackenzie Street, Bendigo.
References to
the term ‘historical interest’ should be removed from the Statement
of Significance.
The Panel recommends:
Amend the Statement of Significance for 83-119
Mackenzie Street, Bendigo based on the Part B version (Document 28.1) and
a) add information about the additional stages of
development of Glendure House being constructed by 1858, then rebuilt/remodelled
and extended several times in 1861, 1868, 1871 and 1876

(ii) Background
The Heritage Overlay currently applies to 130 High
Street as part of the Rowan Street Precinct (HO11).
The Amendment proposes to remove the property from the Rowan Street Precinct
(HO11) and include it as a site with individual significance
in the Heritage
Overlay (HO986).
(iii) Evidence and submissions
Initially the landowner of 130 High Street:
removal of the Heritage Overlay (HO11) from land at 128 and 130 High Street
opposed the
application of the Heritage Overlay (HO986) to 130 High Street.
was submitted the Heritage Overlay should not be applied to 130 High Street
based on the poor condition of the building and plans
for demolition and
redevelopment of the site.
In reviewing the Rowan Street Precinct, Ms Howe explained the area between
Don and Vine Streets was considered not cohesive enough
for inclusion in a
heritage precinct and led to several potentially significant places in these
areas being assessed for individual
significance. 128 High Street was assessed
as not meeting the threshold for individual significance. 130 High Street was
as having significance under Hercon Criterion A (historical), B
(rarity) and D (representative).
Council referred to further discussions with the landowner and proposed
changes to the Statement of Significance and commensurate
changes to the
Heritage Study Stage 2. These changes included several clarifications as
the shop was
likely constructed in 1902 (removing reference to 1886)
original or
early stylistic elements of the building are significant with frontage to High
reference to the early clock as a significant element
corrugated iron shed in the rear yard and later additions to the front
façade and shopfront plinth do no contribute
to the significance of the
reference to ‘rarity’ regarding ‘How it is
significant’.
Ms Schmeder assessed the property having regard
to these proposed changes and undertook a comparative analysis to confirm it met
threshold of Local Significance. Ms Schmeder concluded:
the shop at 130
High Street compares well to other Victorian and early Edwardian shops currently
or recommended to be Significant
in the Heritage Overlay retaining its timber
shopfront distinguished by a higher level of embellishment than is standard
its overall
form, shopfront and intactness support its status as Significant in the Heritage
the place does
not meet Criterion B (rarity) at the local level because the clock is reportedly
battery-operated and thus not original
(the clock having been the sole reason
upon which the place’s rarity value was based)
there is no
evidence the first part of the shop was constructed in the 19
century so it should be recognised as solely from the Edwardian era
brick veneer has
been added to the shopfront plinth and is not of heritage value
the outbuilding
behind the shop is not of heritage value.
Ms Schmeder recommended
the history and description for the place should be revised to reflect these
findings in the Statement of
Significance and heritage citation in the Heritage
Study Stage 2.
Council supported this position and submitted these changes would be
consistent with PPN1. A revised Statement of Significance showing
these changes
was tabled as Document 19, Attachment 3. The landowner wrote to the Panel
expressing support for the Amendment with
the changes as proposed.
(iv) Discussion
The comparative analysis undertaken by Ms Schmeder
supports the local significance attributable to the property in relation to
A and D as a historically significant example of commercial
development which occurred on the principal roads outside the central
of Bendigo in the early twentieth century. The application of the Heritage
Overlay is considered appropriate.
The Panel understands the clock was the only reason it was considered to have
significance for Criterion B (rarity) and given it has
been established the
clock could not have been original this criterion is not applicable.
Ms Schmeder’s additional investigations have provided further
information to clarify the likely date of construction of the
distinguish elements of the place that do not contribute to its significance.
It is appropriate to amend the Statement
of Significance and heritage citation
in the Heritage Study Stage 2 to reflect this information.
(v) Conclusions and recommendations
The Panel concludes:
Heritage Overlay should be applied to 130 High Street, Bendigo as a historically
significant example of commercial development
which occurred on the principal
roads outside the central district of Bendigo in the early twentieth
The Statement of
Significance for 130 High Street should be amended to:
reference to Criterion B (rarity) from ‘How is it significant’ as
the clock is not an original feature
- update the
construction date of the shop from 1866 to 1902
- add a list of
elements that do not contribute to the heritage significance of the place
reference to the early clock as a significant element.
Panel recommends:
Amend the Statement of Significance for 130
High Street, Bendigo as shown in Appendix C1 to:
a) clarify in ‘What is significant?’
the date the shop was likely constructed and remove reference to the clock as a
significant
feature, include the clock, rear shed and later additions to the
shop front façade and plinth as non-significant elements.
b) remove in ‘How is it significant?’
reference to rarity significance.
c) include in ‘Why is it significant’
more detail to:
the date the building was constructed
reference to the clock.

(ii) Background
It is proposed to apply the Heritage Overlay to 40
Mackenzie Street West as an individually significant property (HO978). The
contains the former Gladstone Hotel.
(iii) Evidence and submissions
The landowner of 40 Mackenzie Street West submitted
the description of the building in the Statement of Significance is incorrect,
specifically the reference to it having remained relatively unaltered since its
construction and misrepresents alterations undertaken
on the building. The
submission noted changes including:
opaque glass in
the lower portion of the three sash windows
sandblasting of
the front facade
replacement of
the front gutter and downpipes
replacement of
the roof iron visible from the street with zincalume corrugated
The submission pointed out the door on the left-hand side of
the building (when viewed from the street) which has been removed and
with bricks, suggesting a later extension to the building.
Following further investigation, Council agreed to amend the Statement of
Significance to further clarify the evolution of the hotel’s
construction
and to indicate the roof cladding and opaque glazing are not original.
Ms Schmeder noted the detailed history provided in the Stage 2 Heritage
Study. Following review of this information, the submission
and Council’s
proposed response, Mr Schmeder concluded:
Gladstone Hotel was built in several phases. The surviving section are the
left-hand side built in 1876, and the gable-fronted
right-hand side of
This evolution
of the building has been extensively researched and clearly presented in the
history section of the citation, but not
clearly expressed in the statement of
significance.
Key alterations
to the exterior of the building, such as sandblasting, have been documented in
the place citation. The use of the
term “corrugated iron roof”,
however, suggests a higher level of intactness than is accurate. The recent
introduction
of opaque glazing should also be identified as non-original.
Overall, the
1876 and 1903 phases of the building are sufficiently intact to meet the
threshold of Local Significance.
history in the place citation documents the important place the Gladstone Hotel
held in the community, this was only the
case up until its closure in 1921. For
this reason, it no longer has social significance as defined by Hercon Criterion
G. This importance
to the past community is, instead, an element of its
historical significance, and should be expressed in relation to Criterion
In relation to the last point, Ms Schmeder explained the Heritage
Council of Victoria expressly revised this Hercon Criterion (Criterion
avoid the mistake of applying it to places with past social significance, and
while noting this is not yet specified in PPN1,
the criterion in PPN1 is
intended to have the same meaning as Hercon.
Ms Schmeder proposed several changes to the Statement of Significance to
reflect these findings which Council supported at the Hearing.
(iv) Discussion
The Panel agrees the history presented in the Stage
2 Heritage Study could be more clearly expressed in the Statement of
Significance
and supports proposed changes to further explain the evolution of
the hotel’s construction.
It accepts that the opaque glazing to lower sashes of some windows is not
original, and it is appropriate to identify these in the
Statement of
Significance as non-significant elements.
Reference to the recent replacement of the roof is also appropriate.
The Panel accepts Ms Schmeder’s evidence that Criterion G (social
significance) should only be applied where there is
attachment to a place. The social significance described in the citation refers
only to past significance and on this
basis it does not meet Criterion G.
Reference to the past community use of the former hotel should be included as
part of its historical
significance in relation to Criterion A.
(v) Conclusions and recommendations
The Panel concludes:
exhibited Statement of Significance for 40 Mackenzie Street, West Golden Square
should be amended to more accurately describes
the evolution of the
hotel’s construction, including elements that are not significant (being
the opaque glass in some lower
sash windows) and noting the replacement
The importance
of the hotel to the past mining community should be described as part of
Criterion A (historical significance) and
not Criterion G (social
significance).
The Panel recommends:
Amend the Statement of Significance for 40
Mackenzie Street West, Golden Square as shown in Council’s Part B version
a) note in ‘What is significant?’ the
opaque glazing to some lower sashes is recent and not significant.
b) remove in ‘How is it significant?’

Unveiled by CFA Deputy Chief Officer Craig Lapsley 26th March 2006
(iii) Submissions
The Country Fire Authority (CFA) submitted:
the current
building is no longer suitable for CFA operation requirements and the CFA will
be ceasing tenancy at the site in 2025
appropriate for the fire bell to be listed as a significant element of a
heritage place which will result in restrictions
being placed on its removal
- it is accepted
practice the CFA brigade will take the fire bell to the new station
long-held tradition and belief that the bell represents past brigade members and
their service to the community
- members see
care and maintenance of the bell as an important duty demonstrating
acknowledgement and respect for members who served
before them
appropriate for the hose drying tower to be listed as a significant element of a
heritage place which will result in restrictions
being placed on its removal
- the hose dying
tower is a significant financial asset and investment essential to emergency
operations of the CFA
- if a fire
station is decommissioned the tower is dismantled and relocated to the new site
or, if a new tower is built at the new
station, relocated to a station without a
tower to improve its response capability
- hose towers
that are not adequately maintained or used pose a significant risk to the public
and community on a site no longer used
Ms Howe said it was reasonable to remove these
elements from the Statement of Significance given the importance of these
to heritage.
In the Peer Review document, Ms Schmeder notes the tradition is supported by
the heritage citation in the Heritage Study Stage 2 (Volume
2) and said as
neither are part of the original 1909 station design, their removal does not
have a large impact on its significance
(Document 8c).
Ms Schmeder recommended reviewing the wording of the Statement of
Significance should the Fire Station close to reflect that it is
operational and notes this may impact on whether it retains ongoing social
significance (Criterion G).
Council submitted the fire bell and hose drying tower should be removed from
the Statement of Significance for 260 High Street.
(iv) Discussion
Information about the Golden Square Fire Station in
the citation is evidence of the tradition of the relocation of fire bells and
towers to other fire stations in the event a station is relocated, and
importantly for this particular bell and tower.
The citation also refers to the ringing of a fire bell at the opening of the
station in August 1909, which infers there was an original
bell, prior to the
donation of the Long Gully bell in
The Panel notes Ms Schmeder did not consider the removal of the bell or hose
drying tower would have a large impact on the significance
of the place because
they were not part of the original station fabric. The Panel therefore agrees
it is appropriate to remove them
from the Statement of Significance on this
The Fire Station has ceased operation and the fire bell and tower have been
removed. The Statement of Significance should be revised
to reflect this
status. The Panel supports Ms Schmeder’s recommendation that it also be
reassessed in regard to Criterion
G (social significance), referred to in the
Statement of Significance as ’associative significance’, as this
should only
be applied where there is
community attachment to a
(v) Conclusions and recommendations
The Panel concludes:
is appropriate to remove the bell and tower as significant elements from the
Statement of Significance for 260 High Street, Golden
Square as they were not
part of the original fabric of the Fire Station.
The Statement of
Significance should be revised to remove reference to the Fire Station still

recommends:
Reassess the social (associative) significance
of 260 High Street, Golden Square now the Fire Station has ceased operation, and
no longer relevant remove this reference to Criterion G from the Statement of
Significance.
Amend the Statement of Significance for 260
High Street, Golden Square to:

The Heritage Overlay currently applies to 24 Booth
Street as part of the Rowan Street Precinct (HO11). The Amendment proposes to
remove the property from the Rowan Street Precinct (HO11) and include it as a
site with individual significance in the Heritage Overlay
(iii) Evidence and submissions
The landowner of 24 Booth Street submitted the
Statement of Significance should be revised for this property to:

and do not relate to the weatherboard
cottages mentioned in the history of the
remove reference
to the ’original door’ as the corner front door is a new door and
the original door is no longer present.
Ms Howe said further
assessment of the property confirmed:
weatherboard
additions do not relate to the earlier cottages on site and are likely to be of
1970s construction
the current
corner door is visually similar to a period door but shows none of the expected
details and is a replacement door.
On this basis, Council submitted
the Statement of Significance should be amended to remove reference to the
weatherboard additions
and rephrase reference to the original door as
’door opening’. It also proposed to revise wording to include the
’largely’ before ’unaltered state’ in relation to
Criterion B (rarity) to reflect this position.
(iv) Discussion
The Panel accepts further investigation clarified
non-significant elements of the building and agrees the Statement of
Significance
should be updated to reflect these findings.
(v) Conclusions and recommendations
The Panel concludes:
Statement of Significance for 24 Booth Street should be amended to

- clarify the
original door is identifiable as a former opening and not a current door
- clarify the
building is “largely” unaltered.
The citation in
the Heritage Study Stage 2 should be amended accordingly.
recommends:
Amend the Statement of Significance for 24
Booth Street, Golden Square as shown in Appendix C to:
a) remove in ‘What is significant?’
reference to weatherboard additions and clarify the significance of the door
relates to the door opening.
b) clarify in ‘Why is it significant’
the building is rare because of its ’largely’ unaltered state.

Overlay from properties along Old Violet
Street, Olive Street and Pitt Street, currently with the Rowan Street Precinct
It was submitted:
there is no
written record as to how or by whom the sites were assessed / reviewed regarding
their heritage significance, or reference
to Hercon criteria
there is no need
to create a gap between precincts to delineate boundaries between the proposed

and recommended for tree controls

The submitter made a further written submission

Directions 1 and 19.
Ms Howe explained the existing Rowan Street
is made up of
parts of several sub-precincts identified in the EBHS (sub-precincts 5.1 and
6.3) and areas in between these sub-precincts
is unclear why

In reviewing the
Rowan Street Precinct, Ms Howe said:
initially 10 new
heritage precincts were identified as well as a much-reduced boundary for the
redefined Rowan Street Precinct
the proposed new
precincts have distinct statements of significance
boundaries of
the new precincts were sometimes dictated by areas that have low integrity or
have lost cohesion, including the Old
Violet Street, Reef Street Olive Street
area where a cluster of later development disrupts the heritage streetscape and
development patterns have eroded past the point of legibility
an early draft
of the precinct was peer reviewed, and further changes were made to the
boundaries to strengthen their cohesion
some individual
properties not within the proposed new boundaries were recommended for inclusion
as individual places of significance.
Ms Schmeder noted initial
precinct boundaries were considered to have very diverse characters as well as
areas of low cohesion and
were reviewed with the goal of identifying smaller,
more cohesive precincts. Areas with few contributory properties were
recommended
for removal from the Precinct.
Regarding 46-48 Old Violet Street, and following the provision of extensive
further information by the submitter through the Hearing
process, Ms Schmeder
the site was
clearly the principal site for the Monument Hill Mine
undoubtedly archaeological remains underground but there is no understanding of
how intact these are
archaeological remains are protected from disturbance under the
Heritage Act
as there are no
above ground remains it is unsuitable for protection in the Heritage
the property is
in an area set apart from the nearest heritage buildings, so its future
development is unlikely to have a notable
impact on their appreciation of the
heritage value of adjoining precincts (an analysis of which way existing
heritage dwellings were
facing was provided).
In response to a Panel
question about whether development of sites to be removed from the Heritage
Overlay would impact on views of
the heritage places when coming up Olive
Street, Ms Schmeder said development close to the frontage of sites could
potentially impact
views of the cottage on Pitt Street.
Ms Schmeder recommended:
Council prepare
a site card for 46-48 Old Violet Street and provide it to Heritage Victoria for
inclusion in the Victorian Heritage

Council acknowledged the
discrepancy between the Precinct boundary mapping and significant tree mapping
in the Old Violet Street Precinct
and submitted it would review all relevant
statements of significance to ensure boundaries were aligned and to remove
notations (green
dots) illustrating significant trees which are
the precinct.
(iv) Discussion
The heritage basis of the revised boundaries for
the Rowan Street Precinct (HO11), proposed new Nettle Street Precinct (HO956)
Old Violet Street Precinct (HO957) is not readily apparent in the Heritage
Study Stage 2. Ms Howe’s explanation assisted the
understanding of how the process evolved and the need for review of the existing
Rowan Street Precinct. The Panel
accepts the proposed new precincts provide
clearer, more distinct statements of significance.
46-48 Old Violet Street was clearly once an important mine site, Monument
Hill, and it is acknowledged archaeological fabric remains
underground. The
Panel agrees it should be recommended for inclusion in the Victorian Heritage
Properties along Old Violet Street, Olive Street and Pitt Street proposed to
be removed from the Heritage Overlay either do not, or
no longer, contain
buildings of heritage significance and would not individually meet the threshold
for inclusion in the Heritage
The Panel has considered at length whether it is appropriate to remove these
properties from the Heritage Overlay due to their lack
of heritage significance,
or whether they should remain in the Heritage Overlay as Non-contributory
As noted in Chapter 4.1, Ms Schmeder explained including Non-contributory
properties in a Heritage Overlay precinct is a means of
ensuring their future
redevelopment does not have a negative impact on the heritage significance of
the precinct as a whole.
The Panel observes:
removing the
properties would result in an irregular shaped strip of land between two
heritage precincts in the centre of a low scale
residential area
the south side
of Pitt Street would largely be retained in the Heritage Overlay
one property on
the north side of Pitt Street is proposed for inclusion in the Miners’
Housing Serial Listing Study
3 Reef Street,
adjacent to 46-48 Old Violet Street is not included in this Amendment and has an
individual Heritage Overlay.
The Panel appreciates it is not
sensible to apply the Heritage Overlay to large strips of Non-contributory
places. PPN1 does not
provide guidance on the inclusion of Non-contributory
places in a heritage precinct. The relevance of the streetscapes where these
properties are located is considered an important factor in determining whether
to include these particular Non-contributory properties.
While the properties proposed to have the Heritage Overlay removed no longer
contain buildings of heritage significance, the general
streetscapes exhibit
features that continue to reflect their history and link with the proposed
adjoining heritage precincts, including:
street trees in
Olive Street assessed as having historical significance and described as
‘dominant features in the streetscape
and likely to be early street tree
planting associated with the precinct’

former mine site, with frontages to
Old Violet Street, Olive Street and Reef
stone gutters in
Pitt Street along both sides referenced in the citation for Precinct 6.3 in the
EBHS which were once a feature of
It is apparent that
development in these streetscapes could influence the heritage significance of
the streetscapes and proposed adjoining
heritage precincts. 46-48 Old Violet
Street is a large site sitting further up the hill when viewed from the bottom
end of Olive
Street. Ms Schmeder acknowledged its future development could
impact on views of a heritage dwelling on Pitt Street if sited close
frontage. This could also be the case for other properties along Olive Street
proposed to be removed from the Heritage Overlay.
The Panel considers the Old Violet Street Precinct should be extended to
include these properties and does not agree their inclusion
would undermine the
cohesion of the Precinct. The Statement of Significance for the Old Violet
Street Precinct includes ‘streetscapes’
in ‘What is
Significant’ and refers to streetscape elements including early and
original tree plantings.
The NCO may have been an acceptable alternative planning tool to manage
development of these properties within their heritage setting.
However, this
was not contemplated as part of this Amendment.
The Panel agrees that the purpose of the Heritage Overlay does not extend to
identifying and managing potentially contaminated land.
Ministerial Direction 1
applies to potentially contaminated land and requires such land to be further
considered when preparing
an amendment which allows land to be used for a
sensitive use. Applying or removing the Heritage Overlay does not change
use of the land (which is governed by land use zones). Similarly
Ministerial Direction 19 is not applicable.
It was recommended in the Tree Study to apply tree controls to Tree 147. This
tree was assessed as meeting the following criteria:
Significance
Outstanding
Particularly
Unique Location
The Old Violet Street Precinct (HO957) includes Tree 146, and
the boundary should be extended to include Tree 147.

8 Non-heritage issues
8.1 2-20 Chum Street, Golden Square
(i) The issues
issues are whether:
Clause 11.03-1L
should be reworded to include the southern part of 2-20 Chum Street, Golden
Square within the St John of God Activity
a place-based
policy for Golden Square should be included in Clause 11.03-6L to more clearly
incorporate the objectives and strategies
of the Structure Plan
Clause 16.01-1L
should be reworded to better reflect the intended future development of the land
at 2-20 Chum Street.
(ii) Submissions
Ophir Holdings Pty Ltd (Ophir) generally supported
the Amendment however requested three changes to the Planning Policy Framework.
It noted an amendment request had been lodged to rezone land at 2-20 Chum Street
to the Mixed Use Zone.
Firstly, Ophir submitted land at 2-20 Chum Street should be explicitly
referenced at Clause 11.03-1L, potential under ‘Centre
strategies’ to tie in the designation of the land within the St John of
God Activity Centre to:
reinforce its
strategic importance
provide a clear
policy basis for future planning decisions
consistency with the Structure Plan and broader Amendment
objectives.
Ophir noted proposed changes to Clause 19.02-1L (below)
which refer to this strategic intent, but submitted a cross-reference at Clause
11.03-1L would strengthen policy clarity.
medical/allied services along Chum Street that link to St John of God Hospital
and the Bendigo Day Surgery.
Council did not agree to include a
reference to the land at Clause 11.03-1L and submitted:
the Structure
Plan does not provide specific guidance for the designation of 2-20 Chum Street
within the St John of God Activity Centre
strategies at Clause 19.02-1L and Clause 16.01-1L appropriately capture all
strategies from the Structure Plan relevant to
suggested Clause 11.03-1L could be amended under the ‘Centre specific
strategies’ to include text that seeks
redevelopment to occur as per the specific precinct plans of the Golden Plains
Structure Plan
Alternatively, Ophir requested additional sub-clauses (i.e. a place-based
policy) at Clause 11.03-6L to more clearly incorporate the
objectives and
strategies of the Structure Plan submitting this would:
improve policy
clarity for Council officers and applicants
strengthen the
linkage between the Amendment and the Structure Plan
reflect best
practice in structuring the Planning Policy Framework.
explained the Amendment was originally drafted with a proposed sub-clause at
Clause 11.03-6L (Golden Square) which included
all relevant strategies from the
Structure Plan. However, Council received a letter from the DTP on 2 June 2023
with pre-authorisation
conditions requiring (among other things) the
redistribution of local planning policies from proposed Clause 11.03-6L to
thematically
appropriate clauses in the PPF, and provided an example document to
demonstrate. Council revised the Amendment in response to this
pre-authorisation condition.
Ophir stated it would have supported the original intent of the Amendment
wording proposed by Council and said this approach was consistent
Practitioner’s Guide to Victoria’s Planning Schemes
(Practitioner’s Guide) regarding place-based policy formulation and that
distributing policy across multiple themes dilutes
the Structure Plan’s
strategic weight.
The third request by Ophir was to amend Clause 16.01-1L to better reflect the
intended future development of the land at 2-20 Chum
Council supported this request and proposed the following wording as set out
in the Part B submission (Document 28):
Support the redevelopment of land on the Southern Cross Austereo land at 161
Lily Street and 2–20 Chum Street for mixed use,
residential, short-term
accommodation and aged care or medical-related facilities.
Ophir confirmed its support of this wording and noted the Structure Plan
should be updated to reflect the revised wording. Council
supported this change
to the Structure Plan.
(iii) Discussion
The Structure Plan refers to significant
opportunities to redevelop land at 2-20 Chum Street, including for
“mixed use residential, short-term accommodation, aged care or medical
related facilities”
“link to St John of God
(page 22) or
“integrate with and service the
medical related facilities currently occurring in the area”
It does not provide specific guidance to include the site within the St John of
God Activity Centre but does provide the
opportunity for a potential
association. It would be premature to reference the site as part of the St John
of God Activity Centre
in Clause 11.03-1L through this Amendment.
In considering Ophir’s request to include a place-based policy for
Golden Square in Clause 11.03-6L, the Panel notes Council’s
intention to do so and the DTP’s direction (as a pre-authorisation
condition) to redistribute the policy to thematically
appropriate clauses in the
PPF. The Practitioner’s Guide states a place-based policy must:
specific, discrete spatial area. The area to which the policy applies must be
mapped showing clear, defined boundaries.

relating to multiple issues where there are interrelationships between those

integrated policy approach to provide a coherent strategic narrative. If the

content in specific controls that apply to the place, such as a Design and
Development Overlay. However, there may be
benefit in providing a brief
cross-reference to a specific control where it would support the coherence of a
In this circumstance, particular consideration is given to
whether the proposed strategies have a common objective specific to Golden
Square that would require an integrated policy rather than placement under
relevant thematic headings. From a review of the proposed
strategies through
the PPF, the Panel could not readily identify a common objective specific to
Golden Square that would require
the strategies to be considered in an
integrated policy. Therefore, the Panel does not agree a place-based policy at
Clause 11.03-6L
is necessary.
Notwithstanding, the Structure Plan does include precinct-based guidance for
different areas in Golden Square that is not easily captured
by the structure of
the PPF. This includes guidance for several activity centres captured somewhat
through proposed strategies under
relevant thematic headings. However, the
Panel considers this could be strengthened by including an additional strategy
‘Centre specific strategies’ at Clause 11.03-1L to
encourage redevelopment of activity centres in accordance with the
The Panel supports the proposed change to the wording of Clause 16.01-1L as
agreed between Council and Ophir to improve clarity about
the future development
of 2-20 Chum Street. It is appropriate to update the Structure Plan with the
same wording for consistency.
(iv) Conclusions and recommendations
The Panel concludes:
11.03-1L should not be reworded to include the southern part of 2-20 Chum
Street, Golden Square within the St John of God Activity
Centre because the
Structure Plan does not specify this outcome.

new strategy should be included under ‘Centre specific strategies’
at Clause 11.03-1L to encourage redevelopment of
activity centres in accordance
with the Structure Plan.
16.01-1L should be reworded to better reflect the intended future development of
the land at 2-20 Chum Street, and make associated
changes to the Golden Square
Structure Plan.
The Panel recommends:
Amend Clause 11.03-1L to include a new
strategy under ‘Centre specific strategies’ as follows:
Encourage redevelopment of activity centres
in Golden Square in accordance with the Golden Square Structure
Amend Clause 16.01-1L to reword the last dot
point as follows:
Support the redevelopment of land on the
Southern Cross Austereo site at 161 Lily Street and 2-20 Chum Street, for mixed
use, residential,
short-term accommodation and aged care or medical related
facilities.
8.2 Panton Street, Golden Square
(i) The issue
issue whether land on Panton Street between Maple and Laurel Streets should be
rezoned from Commercial 1 Zone to a residential
zone as part of the
(ii) Submissions
One submission requested properties in Panton
Street, between Laurel Street and Maple Street be rezoned to a residential zone,
that development of the land with a commercial business would:
keeping with the neighbourhood which is residential in nature
increase the
number of parked cars, where resident parking is already limited
detract from the
amenity of the area.
Council explained the Structure Plan recommends
rezoning the Panton Street properties to a residential zone. However, the DTP
recommended
all residential rezoning should be undertaken through the planning
scheme amendment to implement Council’s Managed Growth Strategy,
the long-term residential planning framework for Bendigo. Council is
progressing the rezoning of these properties through
Amendment C293gben, which
is currently in drafting stage.
(iii) Discussion
The Panel supports Council’s approach to
progressing the rezoning of Panton Street properties between Maple and Laurel
as part of Amendment C293gben in accordance with advice from the DTP.
It is logical to implement land use changes relating to residential
development
as part of a consolidated municipal growth strategy when possible as this allows
for a comprehensive understanding of
how residential growth is planned to occur
throughout Bendigo.
(iv) Conclusions
The Panel concludes land on Panton Street between
Maple and Laurel Streets should not be rezoned from Commercial 1 Zone to a
residential
zone as part of this Amendment. The approach to progress the
rezoning of this land through proposed Amendment C293gben is supported.

B:2 Planning
scheme provisions
The Industrial 3 Zone purposes are:
To implement the
Municipal Planning Strategy and the Planning Policy Framework.
To provide for
industries and associated uses in specific areas where special consideration of
the nature and impacts of industrial
uses is required or to avoid inter-industry
To provide a
buffer between the Industrial 1 Zone or Industrial 2 Zone and local communities,
which allows for industries and associated
uses compatible with the nearby
To allow limited
retail opportunities including convenience shops, small scale supermarkets and
associated shops in appropriate locations.
To ensure that
uses do not affect the safety and amenity of adjacent, more sensitive land
The Amendment proposes to rezone land in two locations to the
Industrial 3 Zone to support the separation of industrial uses requiring
from residential areas.
The Heritage Overlay purposes are:
To implement the
State Planning Policy Framework and the Local Planning Policy Framework,
including the Municipal Strategic Statement
and local planning policies.
To conserve and
enhance heritage places of natural or cultural significance.
To conserve and
enhance those elements which contribute to the significance of heritage
To ensure that
development does not adversely affect the significance of heritage places.
To conserve
specifically identified heritage places by allowing a use that would otherwise
be prohibited if this will demonstrably
assist with the conservation of the
significance of the heritage place.
The Heritage Overlay requires a
planning permit to demolish, subdivide, build or carry out works. The Heritage
Overlay enables its
Schedule to specify additional controls for specific trees,
painting previously unpainted surfaces, internal alterations and an incorporated
plan (which may exempt buildings and works and other changes from requiring a
planning permit). The Schedule may also identify if
a place can be considered
for uses that are otherwise prohibited, subject to a planning permit.
The objectives of the DDO34 are:
To create a
compact neighbourhood activity centre that is vibrant and offers high quality,
contemporary and diverse built form.
buildings to achieve a high quality interface and active street frontage to the
public realm, including along the Bendigo
Creek corridor.
To define the
entrances to the neighbourhood activity centre by supporting unique design on
key corners and reinforce High Street
as the main commercial spine.
To facilitate
development that provides improved pedestrian amenity and connection to existing
and proposed pedestrian links.
The Amendment proposes to apply the
DDO34 to properties in the commercial precinct to support appropriately designed
commercial development
in the activity centre.

Planning Practice Note 1 (Applying the Heritage Overlay),
August 2018
Planning Practice Note 1 provides guidance about
using the Heritage Overlay. It states that the Heritage Overlay should be
to, among other places:
Places identified in a local heritage study, provided the significance of the
place can be shown to justify the application of the
Planning Practice Note 1 specifies that documentation for each heritage place
needs to include a statement of significance that clearly
establishes the
importance of the place and addresses the heritage criteria. It recognises the
following model criteria (the Hercon
criteria) that have been adopted for
assessing the value of a heritage place:
Criterion A:
Importance to the course or pattern of our cultural or
natural history (historical significance).
Criterion B:
Possession of uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of our
cultural or natural history (rarity).
Criterion C:
Potential to yield information that will contribute to an
understanding of our cultural or natural history (research potential).
Criterion D:
Importance in demonstrating the principal characteristics
of a class of cultural or natural places or environments
(representativeness).
Criterion E:
Importance in exhibiting particular aesthetic
characteristics (aesthetic significance).
Criterion F:
Importance in demonstrating a high degree of creative or
technical achievement at a particular period (technical significance).
Criterion G:
Strong or special association with a particular community
or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. This includes
significance of a place to Indigenous peoples as part of their continuing and
developing cultural traditions (social significance).
Criterion H:
Special association with the life or works of a person,
or group of persons, of importance in our history (associative
significance).

significant
How is it significant?
The brick shop with timber parapet at
130 High Street,
Bendigo, is of local historical
and representative
significance to the City of Greater Bendigo.
Why is it significant?
The shop at
130 High Street, Bendigo, is historically
significant as an example of the commercial development that occurred on the
roads outside the central district of Bendigo
nineteenth century
. Bendigo’s primary commercial precinct had
developed around Pall Mall and the surrounding streets in the 1850s; however, as
the town began to expand in the following decades, smaller commercial groups and
individual shops were established along the main
thoroughfares that led to its
centre. This sporadic commercial development serviced both the surrounding
suburban areas and travellers
to Bendigo. High Street was one of the primary
routes to Bendigo, and the subject site, constructed
in 1866 and
in 1902, reflects the continuing importance of commerce on
this road through the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 130
High Street is an example of the type of modest shops that were constructed on
routes into Bendigo. Many of these shops were generally less ornate in size
and decoration than those located in the city. With its
modest size and timber
parapet, the subject site is a remaining example of the type of small-scale
commercial development that occurred
on the outskirts of the city. (Criteria A
The shop at 130 High Street, Bendigo, is significant for its rare
clock set within the transom window of the shopfront. The clock,
believed to
date to the 1902 alterations undertaken by owner and tenant William Bartle, a
watchmaker, is an uncommon addition to
a shopfront. It was likely an early form
of advertising for Bartle’s shop at the site and has remained in situ
since. (Criterion

C:2 Statement
of Significance: 24 Booth Street, Golden Square
significant?
The brick shop and house (known as 24 Booth Street) is located on the corner
of Mackenzie and Booth Streets, was built between 1872
and 1874, and is
significant.
The elements of significance are the unpainted red brick building
weatherboard
and its primary components:
hipped corrugated iron roof, cream brick facing around windows and doors,
original door
and stone steps, door
residence and two double hung sash windows, stucco cornice and parapet with
traces of buff coloured limewash. The corner
location (and view) of the brick
shop and house contributes to the significance of the place.
How is it significant?
The brick shop and house at 24 Booth Street, Golden Square, is of local
historical and rarity significance to the City of Greater
Why is it significant?
The brick shop and house at 24 Booth Street is historically significant as a
testament to how Bendigo grew as a city through the emergence
of unplanned
villages, such as Golden Square, in the scattered gold bearing gullies. These
communities developed around concentrations
of hotels, shops, churches and
manufacturing businesses. (Criterion A)
The brick shop and house at 24 Booth Street is architecturally significant as
an original corner shop and residence associated with
the late 19th-century
growth of Bendigo. Comparison with other places of a similar age and type in
Bendigo shows that 24 Booth Street
is rare because of its
unaltered state. (Criterion B)
