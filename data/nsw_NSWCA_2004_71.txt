INTRODUCTION
This is an application for both leave, and, if granted, the disposition of
three appeals, all in relation to costs only. These
three appeals are CA
40699/03 (LEC 40012/00), CA 40137/03 (LEC 40120/00) and CA 40138/03 (LEC
3 The claimant in the three appeals was the owner and occupant of 78 Booth
Street, Annandale, Peter Francis Gorczynski; he was
also the appellant in the
main appeal. The first opponent in CA40699/03, and the second opponent in
CA40137/03 is Leichhardt Council.
The first and second opponents in CA40138/03
were the occupants of 80 Booth Street, Annandale. This property is the
adjoining property
to No 78. No. 80 is the property that is the subject of
both these cost appeals and the main judgment (now CA 40250/03 being the
appeal). The first opponent in CA 40137/03 is Annandale Services Pty Ltd.
4 The judge at trial set out a brief outline of the facts in the three matters.
It was stated at the end of the hearing of the main
appeal that resolution of
it was not likely to lead to resolution of those three leaves to appeal, as
they relate to different aspects
of this voluminous litigation though related
in subject matter. Not irrelevant to the exercise of discretion to grant or
leave, this litigation has already involved cost and complexity in no
way proportionate to the modest amount at stake. It was accepted
that no oral
hearing was required, as the written submissions said all the parties wished to
say on the three leaves to appeal.
SALIENT FACTS
CA 40699/03
5 The trial judge summarised the relevant facts in this application:
"[1(a)] The original class 4 application in these proceedings filed 24 January
2000 challenged the validity of development consent
No 334/98 authorising
certain structures including a garage/ workshop located at the rear of No. 80
("the garage") which had previously
been erected without consent on or about
May 1997. This application also challenged the validity of two building
certificates No.187/99
and No.269/99 and sought the demolition of encroachments
onto the applicant's land.
[4] These proceedings did not reach a final hearing as all the issues between
the parties, save the issue of costs, were resolved
and accordingly the
application was dismissed on 28 June 2002.
[22] The first respondents demolished a significant portion of the allegedly
unlawful works on 22 March 2001. However, not all the
works which were the
subject of the challenge were demolished and these remaining works were dealt
with in the consent orders made
on 28 June 2002."
6 The trial judge determined that there be no order for costs against the first
opponent. The trial judge did however award costs
to the applicant against the
second and third respondents:
"[24] Although these proceedings did not proceed to a final hearing on the
merits, the orders made on 28 June 2002 and the adoption
of the Gleeson Report
have the combined effect that the applicant was successful in obtaining the
orders it sought against the first
respondents. Accordingly the ordinary rule
that costs should follow the event will apply (see generally
Richmond River Council
[1993] HCA 11
(1998) 193 CLR 72).
These costs will include the
applicant's costs in relation to the appointment of the referee and of the
Gleeson Report."
7 The applicant claims that a costs order should also have been made against
the first opponent.
CA 40138/03
8 The facts of this matter were as stated by the trial judge:
"[1(b)] By class 3 application filed on 20 June 2000 the applicant sought
demolition of the garage for reason that it encroached
upon his land. The
proceedings were instituted against the first and second respondent only and
did not involve Leichhardt Council"
9 The trial judge concluded that the power of the court to grant relief where
an encroachment has occurred is discretionary
Encroachment of
Buildings Act
). Accordingly the court could not be satisfied that the
claimant was almost certain to have succeeded at trial. Furthermore the
judge found that neither party had conducted itself in such an unreasonable
manner in the proceedings that it should be made
to bear the burden of the
other party's costs.
10 The trial judge set out to describe the facts of this matter in these terms:
"[1(c)] By class 4 application filed 14 August 2000 the applicant sought
interlocutory orders restraining the council from assessing
development
application D2000/434 dated 6 June 2000 lodged by Annandale Services Pty
Limited ("Annandale Services") [the former lessor
of No. 80] seeking consent to
use the whole of No. 80 for the purpose of a real estate agency. These
proceedings did not involve
the first respondents [The occupants of No 80].
[30] The applicant was unsuccessful in obtaining interlocutory relief and did
not ultimately pursue his claim for final relief in
these proceedings. His
claim for final relief was made redundant because the council granted
development [scil. Consent] for use
of part of No. 80 as a real estate agency
with development consent D/2001/254 which is subject to challenge in
proceedings 40208
11 His Honour ruled that the claimant would have almost certainly have failed
in obtaining a declaration that the permit was invalid.
Accordingly the court
ordered that the claimant pay the costs of the second opponent ("the Council").
12 However, the Court was not satisfied that the claimant would necessarily
have failed in obtaining the orders it sought restraining
Annandale Services
from using No. 80 as a real estate agency since that company had not obtained
consent to do so. Accordingly the
Court made an order that Annandale Services
and the claimant bear their own costs in relation to proceedings 40120/00.
13 The claimant appealed against both of these rulings. He argued that both
the first and second opponents should have paid for
his costs. He submitted
that the trial judge "
appears to have omitted to consider that the Local
Environment Plan at issue in a later proceedings (40808/01) was
same Local Environment Plan at issue in the subject proceedings
". The claimant contended that:
"The council was alive to the distinction and twice refused to grant consent to
DA D/2000/434 for the reason that the subject use
was not permissible pursuant
to the LEP under which the claimant brought this proceedings. In those
circumstances the Trial Judge,
with respect, erroneously equated the planning
considerations in proceedings 40120/00 with those in 40208/01. It was the
who was almost certain to have obtained a declaration in proceedings
40120/00 that the use of the subject premises as a real estate
agency was not
permissible."
Disposition of Leaves to Appeal
14 The appellant seeks leave to appeal against three costs orders. Leave to
appeal against an order solely relating to costs does
not lie as of right and
is at the discretion of the court; see
Supreme Court Act
101 Appeal in proceedings before the Court
(2) An appeal shall not lie to the Court of Appeal, except by leave of the
Court of Appeal, from:
(c) a judgment given or order made in proceedings in the Court with the consent
of the parties or as to costs only which are in
the discretion of the Court,
15 It is long settled that the approach to be taken when deciding whether to
grant leave to appeal from matters of practice and
procedure was as stated by
Jordan CJ in
In re the Will of F B Gilbert (deceased)
[1946] NSWStRp 24
(1946) 46 SR(NSW)
"... there is a material difference between an exercise of discretion on a
point of practice or procedure and an exercise of discretion
which determines
substantive rights. In the former class of case, if a tight rein were not kept
upon interference with the orders
of Judges of first instance, the result would
be disastrous to the proper administration of justice. The disposal of cases
be delayed interminably, and costs heaped up indefinitely, if a litigant
with a long purse or a litigious disposition could, at will,
in effect transfer
all exercises of discretion in interlocutory applications from a Judge ... to a
Court of Appeal."
16 Costs are, as a general rule, matters of practice and procedure, and
therefore subject to the same stringent standards as
Priestley JA in
Wentworth v Rogers (No 3)
(1986) 6 NSWLR 642
"In a great many cases, including the present, costs are in the discretion of
the Court; they also seem to me to fall within the
category of matters of
practice or procedure. The same policy therefore seems to me to underlie the
granting or withholding of leave
to appeal in a case such as the present as the
policy described by Jordan CJ in
Re the Will of F B Gilbert (Deceased)
[1946] NSWStRp 24
(1946) 46 SR(NSW) 318
17 Since the decision in
there has been recognition of the need
to instil a sense of finality in the decision of trial judges on matters that
are of practice
and procedure, rather than clogging up the appellate courts
with decisions that are more apt to be dealt with by the trial judge.
observed this trend in
Wentworth v Rogers (No. 3)
(supra) at 644:
"...since 1946, there has been an increasing realisation of the public costs
which are involved in litigation and the public interest
that necessitates,
particularly in the multitude of practice decisions that must daily be made in
the courts, a high respect for
finality. Without this, other litigants will be
delayed and the burden on judges and the appellate process will be unacceptably
with consequent public expense.
The provision, contained in the
Supreme Court Act
necessitating leave in a case such as the present, amounts to a legislative
recognition of these considerations."
18 To achieve this more efficient use of court time, leave provisions such as
have been construed so that the bar to achieve leave has been set
considerably higher than for substantive issues. Kirby P at 644
"Accordingly, it is normally necessary for a claimant for such leave to show
something more than that the appeal court would, if
exercising its discretion
afresh, have come to a conclusion different to that reached by the trial judge.
Some error of principle
in the exercise of the discretion, a consideration of
irrelevant matters or some other manifest mistake is needed to take the case
out of the ordinary situation in which, wherever a discretion is to be
exercised, minds may differ on the result: cf
Maiden v Maiden
[1909] HCA 16
McCauley v McCauley
[1910] HCA 16
(1910) 10 CLR 434
Further, Priestley JA at 651:
"One of the purposes of this provision [s101(2)(c)] is to ensure that costs
questions, important though they frequently are to litigants
not only cannot be
further litigated by a party as of right on appeal, but also may only be
allowed to be further litigated by appeal
if the Court of Appeal thinks there
is some good reason, over and above the Court's own opinion of what would have
been the best
costs order in the particular circumstances, for doing so."
19 Similarly, Clarke J in
Parker v NRMA
(1993) 11 ACSR 370
at 401 stated
on a leave application under
s101(2)(c):
"In a case such as the present it would seem to me appropriate to determine
whether an error has been demonstrated of the nature
discussed by Jordan CJ in
Re the Will of Gilbert
46 SR 318 at 323 before determining whether to
grant leave. I say that because I do not think that it would be appropriate to
leave unless the court were disposed to grant the appeal. (See generally
Wentworth v Rogers
(1986) 6 NSWLR 647
, particularly at 651.) I can
detect no specific error of the type discussed by Jordan CJ in the judgment
under appeal. This case
is one in which the trial judge was placed in a
peculiarly advantaged position in determining an appropriate costs order. That
because it was he who witnessed the whole of the trial and observed the
tactical shifts which took place during its course. He would
have appreciated
far better than this court could the nuances involved in the trial and, having
regard to these advantages, I would
not interfere unless a case of error had
been dearly made out. I have already indicated that there has been no
demonstrated error
and in these circumstances I would not interfere with his
Honour's order. Although it is true that Parker did not bring the proceedings
for his own personal benefit it seems to me that his Honour's order took
account of the fact that he was entitled to more than party
and party costs for
the 1987 proceedings."
20 Isaacs J in
Maiden v Maiden
[1909] HCA 16
(1908) 7 CLR 727
anticipated this
stringent approach to reviewing cost orders over 90 years ago:
"As to costs, it is clear that the discretion of the primary tribunal cannot be
interfered with so long as it is not caused by an
erroneous view of the law or
a misapprehension of the facts. In the present instance there was either one or
the other, perhaps both.
The order is materially varied, and the matter of
costs is open to this Court." (at 742)

(1992) 27 NSWLR 91

Rilsung Pty Ltd
[2003] NSWCA 36.
22 It is clear from the authorities that something beyond a mere difference in
opinion with the trial judge must be found before
a court of appeal grants
leave to re-agitate cost determinations, so classically an area where judicial
minds may legitimately differ.
23 In the present case no figure seems to have been put forward as to the
amount of costs at stake. However, the relatively small
nature of the
proceedings, and their interlocutory character would indicate that the figures
would be low. The principle in the
authorities of frugality in granting leave,
stemming from Gilbert, thus attaches to the present matter.
24 The appellant has the onus of showing a manifest error on the part of the
trial judge and, moreover, of the kind warranting appellate
intervention in an
area of discretion concerning practice and procedure. That has not been
demonstrated. Even though in CA 40137/03
the trial judge concededly
misapprehended the identity of the relevant Local Environment Plan, that error,
as the outcome of the
main appeal affirms, was of no consequence in terms of
the conclusion reached by the trial judge, quoted below:
"The applicant failed to obtain interlocutory relief and was almost certain to
have failed in obtaining a declaration that the use
of premises as a real
estate agency was invalid. Accordingly the Court will order that the applicant
pay the council's costs in proceedings
40120 of 2000."
25 Each of the three Leaves to Appeal should be denied with costs against the
claimant in each case. I would so order.
I agree with Santow JA
