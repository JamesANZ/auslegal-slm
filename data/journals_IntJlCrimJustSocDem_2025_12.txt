Justice for the Invisible, Unspeakable and Inevitable: An Abolition
Feminism Analysis of Sexual Violence and the International Criminal

Sexual and gender-based violence; abolition
Introduction
violence pervades narratives of war (Hynes, 2004; Mertus, 2004). Despite its
prevalence, sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV)
was long overlooked due to
its categorisation as an inevitable by-product of conflict (Baaz & Stern,
2009; Buss, 2009; Fitzpatrick,
2016). As a result, SGBV was historically
neglected in the literature, appearing only as brief mentions in war chronicles
(Contamine,
1994; Elton, 1997) or as essentialist accounts rendering it an
inescapable outcome of the hypermasculinity of war (Fukuyama, 1989;
Kern, 1999;
Mosher & Tompkins, 1988). The unprecedented visibility of the atrocities in
Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia propelled
SGBV to the forefront of humanitarian
and scholarly rhetoric, but this was “dangerously easy” and
paradoxically concealed
the diverse needs of victim-survivors within a faceless
mass (Enloe, 2000, p. 109; Schwöbel-Patel, 2018). Ensuing research
established that victim-survivors were often retraumatised and dehumanised by
their experiences at ad hoc tribunals, while those
accused of atrocities were
diminished to narratives of their inherent wickedness (Lopez, 2022; Mertus,
2004). The International Criminal
Court (ICC) was created in 2002 to address
these failures and end impunity, yet the court has secured only two successful
convictions
for SGBV. Given the prevalence of SGBV, this attrition raises
questions of the compatibility of traditional judicial mechanisms with
“justice” in the aftermath of war.
The role of “justice” at the ICC has been extensively researched,
as the court was the first with international jurisdiction
to be entrenched with
restorative and victim-oriented functions (Shimoyachi, 2024). Embedded in
Indigenous practices, these mechanisms
shift the focus from prosecuting and
punishing violations of law toward healing for those harmed, and emphasise
community, repair
and reconciliation (Sardina & Ackerman, 2022). However,
proponents and critics note the contradictions within a court which operates
be both punitive and restorative, with the retributive structure of ICC
proceedings often conflicting with the participatory rights
of victims (Cuppini,
2024; Garkawe, 2003). This tension aligns with broader critiques of restorative
justice, which has been “co-opted
and made into part of the carceral
machinery”, severed from its Indigenous roots and lost within the
oppressive systems of
western societies (Bell, 2021, p. 59). Transformative
justice (TJ), pioneered by women of colour and LGBTQIA+ people, shifts
restorative
principles outside traditional legal and carceral spaces to allow
collective and structural solutions (Davis et al., 2022; Kim, 2020).
abolitionist framework, TJ recognises all forms of violence and oppression as
deeply interconnected, and seeks healing, justice
and accountability through
transforming the conditions which allow harmful acts to occur (Dilts, 2017).
Within the context of international
justice, TJ confronts the “liberal
peace” which sustains transitional justice and emphasises holistic
responses rooted
within the needs of those most affected (Gready & Robins,
2014). As the court has predominantly focused upon non-western and
“underdeveloped” states, TJ would engage with the intersections of
colonialism, and therefore patriarchy and racism,
to understand how these
violences are perpetuated and sustained.
Prior to 2018, the court exclusively investigated alleged situations within
the African continent, with all arrest warrants and indictments
African men. The court has since broadened its gaze to West Asia, Southeast
Asia, Eastern Europe and South America, suggesting
a bias which disadvantages
non-western and “underdeveloped” states. Given the ICC prosecutes
only the “most serious
crimes of concern to the international
community”, this focus implies the most dangerous criminals are native to
the periphery
and reinforces colonial logics which attach barbarity and
wickedness to Black and Brown bodies (Lopez, 2022; Rome Statute, 1998,
These narratives survive through coloniality - the enduring patterns of power
to emerge through the colonial project - which
violently separate the
“irrational and rational, primitive and civilised, traditional and
modern” (Mendoza, 2017; Quijano,
2000, p. 3). Critical scholarship has
exposed the eurocentrism of international criminal law (ICL), as a modern
translation of coloniality
(Dancy et al., 2020). However, proponents reinforce
that all cases before the court must be either voluntarily referred by the
governments
of countries where crimes have occurred or by the United Nations
Security Council (Keppler, 2012). Such a defence reinforces the
fragility of
“justice” within an anarchical system of sovereign states and
overlooks the colonial roots of the scarcity
and political instability
underlying many situations adjudicated by the court. This eclipses the links
between colonialism, underdevelopment
and scarcity which intensify gendered
hierarchies and SGBV. Consideration of the root causes of atrocities does not
fall within the
mandate of the ICC, which shrouds the enduring colonial logics
behind the implicit portrayal of these acts as beyond reason, mimicking
narratives of the “Global South” as “dark corners evolving
into uncivilised events” (Crane, 2005, p. 4).
To explore these tensions, this paper
thematically analyses two cases heard before the court:
The Prosecutor v
Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo
(2016–2018)—the first individual to be
convicted, though later acquitted, of SGBV - and
The Prosecutor v Dominic
(2021–2024)
a former child soldier and the most recent
conviction for SGBV. The first section engages with abolition feminism (AF) and
TJ frameworks,
which view interpersonal forms of violence as rooted in, and
inseparable from, structural violence, and emphasise resolution to harm
visionary thinking. It then outlines the methodology: thematic analysis of
official ICC court reports and transcripts from
the cases against Bemba Gombo
It then presents the findings and discusses two themes
revealed through the analysis:
legalised lawlessness
othering and
ostracisation
. It concludes through building upon Gready and Robins (2014)
to reinforce the precarity in reducing SGBV to a static ahistorical
to be pathologised and punished, rather than an enduring and pervasive
phenomenon deserving of transformative solutions.
Abolition Feminism and Transformative Justice
AF and TJ emerged through social justice advocacy, born from grassroots
resistance to carceral violence (Carlton & Russell, 2018;
Davis et al.,
2022). Collectively, these frameworks view criminal justice institutions as
sites of violence which sustain a broader
system of violent social control, and
therefore consider interpersonal violence as entangled within structural
violence (Gruber,
2023; Kim, 2020). Whilst deeply interconnected, these
frameworks are distinct. AF is a model which identifies intersectional
vulnerabilities
to interpersonal, community and state violence, and demands
intentional and insightful responses to systemic oppression. TJ is abolition
practice, and addresses the conditions which allow violence to occur through
moving beyond state-imposed and institutionalised
criminal punishment systems
(Davis et al., 2022; Palacios, 2016). Applied together, AF and TJ address the
needs of victim-survivors,
perpetrators and their communities through
positioning justice and healing as a continuous process (Barrie, 2020).
Innate to these frameworks is a critique of “carcerality”: a
continuum of punitive state-based and interpersonal violence
embedded within
interlocking systems of oppression and sustained through enduring violent logics
(LeBaron & Roberts, 2010; Richie,
2012). This emanates from inherently
violent carceral institutions, pervaded by countless forms of criminalisation
and intervention,
which disproportionately impact marginalised groups,
exacerbate cycles of violence and normalise sexual violence (Davis et al.,
The continuum is sustained through the static binary of
victim/perpetrator, and violent logics that colonise, racialise and sexualise,
to entrench carcerality within society (Barrie, 2020). Consequently, the
practice of AF and TJ must not only expose the systemic
oppressions within
carceral institutions but also transform the collective thinking which
naturalised retributive justice. This process
is not reformist; rather, it
emphasises the interconnectivity of justice, accountability and community to
address the reality of
harm with compassion. Given the spectrum AF and TJ
confront, scholars embrace the uncertain terrain of this praxis, which
it to remain a contradictory, unfinished, and ambiguous political
project that rejects final solutions and ideological purity”
(Palacious,
2016, p. 95).
An AF and TJ praxis is therefore intersectional and critically disentangles
power, systemic oppressions and carcerality to centre
accountability and justice
(Battle & Powell, 2024). It simultaneously gazes backward and forward to
elucidate historic subjugations
and erasures to inform the tools and strategies
of the future. Moreover, it is purposefully nebulous and ambiguous, as
“contradictions
are generative necessary sites for collective analysis and
labour” (Davis et al., 2022, p. 14). These foundational principles
synthesised with the work of Davis et al. (2022), Barrie (2020) and Currie
(2013) to shape the analysis. This provided a praxis
to extricate implicit and
historic violence, look beyond narrow binaries, confront the underlying
conditions of harm, situate individual
acts of harm within the context of
structural violence, and centre collectivism and community.
Methodology
This article thematically examined two cases heard before the ICC:
Prosecutor v Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo
(2016–2018)
The Prosecutor v Dominic Ongwen
(2021–2024)
Bemba Gombo, a national of the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC), was the President and founder of the Mouvement de liberation du
(MLC) and Commander-in-Chief of its military branch, Armee de
liberation du Congo
(ALC). He was charged as a military commander with
murder and rape, as both a war crime and a crime against humanity, for his role
in atrocities allegedly committed in the Central African Republic (CAR) between
26 October 2002 and 15 March 2003. Bemba Gombo was
initially convicted of all
counts under the “command responsibility” doctrine, which designates
military commanders as
criminally responsible for the behaviour of their
subordinates. However, Bemba Gombo was acquitted upon appeal as the charges of
his conviction exceeded those outlined prior to trial.
Contrarily, Ongwen, a Ugandan national, was the commander of the Sinia
Brigade of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and was charged
with over 70
counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for atrocities allegedly
committed in Northern Uganda between 1 July
2002 and 31 December 2005. Ongwen
was the first direct perpetrator of sexual violence to be convicted by the
court. However, this
decision generated criticism as Ongwen was abducted by the
LRA as a child and moulded into a soldier, signifying that he was also
victim to be criminally charged and convicted by the ICC.
The data for this study comprised official ICC reports and transcripts
gathered from the court website. For
The Prosecutor v Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo
(2016–2018), this included the judgment report (ICC-01/05-01/08-3343),
sentence report (ICC-01/05-01/08-3399), appeal judgment
(ICC-01/05-01/08-3636) and transcripts of victim and witness testimony. For
The Prosecutor v Dominic Ongwen
(2021–2024), this included the judgement report
(ICC-02/04-01/15-1762), the appeal judgment report (ICC-02/04-01/15-2022),
report (ICC-02/04-01/15-1819), reparations report
(ICC-02/04-01/15-2074) and transcripts of victim and witness testimony. These
were publicly available and contained some redactions, with certain
testimony provided by victim-survivors censored to protect their
Despite the volume of data, expanding to include additional cases of SGBV could
have enhanced the depth and nuance of the
analysis. Relevant cases include:
The Prosecutor v Al Hassan Ag Abdoul Aziz Ag Mohamed Ag Mahmoud
who was acquitted of sexual violence charges, and
The Prosecutor v Bosco
the first individual to be successfully convicted of
sexual violence charges.
The selected documents were thematically analysed in reference to Braun and
Clarke (2006), Boyatzis (1998) and Charmaz (1990). The
data were hand-coded and
analysed both inductively and deductively, with the latter informed by the AF
and TJ praxis. This approach
necessitated iterative reviews of the data, to
allow systematic and consistent interpretation to form a cohesive narrative.
thematic analysis typically conceptualises patterns within data in terms
of prevalence, an absence or a limited quantity of a particular
behaviour or
theme was considered equally significant. The cases were initially separated,
with Bemba Gombo analysed in its entirety
first, followed by Ongwen, with the
analysis becoming more connected with familiarity. The early readings of the
data were inductive,
to critically understand the story of each case and reveal
initial themes, and the deductive reads built upon this analysis to reveal
implicit violences. In the Bemba Gombo case, the initial themes included
“ideal victim”
reductive language
fragility and
impenetrability
litigious nonsense
, while the deductive themes
masculinisation of conflict
adversarial violence
obsolescence
militarised language
the law as patriarchy.
In the Ongwen case, the initial themes included
legitimate access to
gendered language
blurring of consent
, while the deductive themes were
eurocentrism
culpability
cycles of violence
segregation as exceptional.
These initial themes and their supporting excerpts were coded further to
connect similarities throughout the data, which established
two themes:
legalised lawlessness
othering and ostracisation.
Analysis and Discussion
The analysis revealed that both the ICC and ICL function as mechanisms that
sustain a persistent cycle of carceral and colonial violence,
operating through
selective jurisdiction, historical amnesia and the legitimisation of punitive
justice under international law.
As Rosenblum (2002) notes, crimes of hate are
rooted in history, often a bloody past obscured by selective narratives of
and civilisation. Postcolonial studies have drawn clear links between
the enduring prevalence of modern conflict in Africa and the
exploitative
violence of colonialism (Comaroff & Comaroff, 2007; Ndlovu-Gatsheni, 2013;
Zeleza 2010). The ICC’s mandate
structurally omits colonial histories from
its prosecutorial scope and reinforces cyclical violences through labelling
contemporary
conflicts as isolated legal issues, rather than legacies of
imperial domination. This permeated the data and shaped each of the identified
themes, which exposed the ICC as a modern iteration of a colonial legacy that is
sustained through covert violences disguised as
progress. Understanding this
duplicity requires interrogating the historical foundations of modernity itself,
which is inextricably
tied to Africa’s colonial past. As French (2021)
argues, without the European colonial projects of the “New World”,
modernity itself is unimaginable. The thematic analysis established two dominant
lawlessness
othering and ostracisation—
both of which
exemplify colonial violence through juridical exceptionalism and the continued
marginalisation of African states within
international legal discourse.
Legalised Lawlessness
International justice is marked by a juxtaposition which severs the amorphous
war stories of anguish and harm from the sterile language
of the law and the
rigidity of its jurisdiction and evidentiary standards. This dichotomy is
intertwined within the colonial, and
subsequently patriarchal, normative
understandings of conflict and the laws enacted to regulate it, reflecting the
symbiotic relationship
between gender oppression and militarism (Enloe, 2004;
Gardam, 1993; Ray, 1996). Within the data, this tension exposed a paradoxical
legalised lawlessness
, observable through the weaponisation of
the law and the harms of legally permissible language. This
“lawfare” situates
the ICC within a historic cycle of violence,
which militarises legal language to further stigmatise and demonise atrocities.
A longitudinal examination of civilians, conflict and sexual violence reveals
parallels across time and space, challenging the traditional
classification of
SGBV as an isolated and inescapable phenomenon (Schwartz & Takseva, 2020;
Seifert, 1994). The erasure of the
traumatic experiences of women during
conflict reflects the historic patriarchal ownership of their chastity, with
their bodies reduced
to an extension of the territories to be conquered (Balberg
& Muehlberger, 2018; Clark, 1987). These acts of dehumanising plunder
subsequently lost within an arena of masculine possession and bloodlust,
rendered invisible by their inevitability. Adjacent
to this exclusion is the
ICC’s categorisation of rape as an “invasion” of the body
(ICC-01/05-01/08-3343, p. 53).
Whilst the Elements of Crimes (2011) suggests
this label was selected for its gender neutrality, to categorise SGBV as an
is to define these acts within the parameters of the very
institution which normalised and concealed it: war. It equally continues
historic dehumanisation of victim-survivors as plunder, preserving archaic
narratives of “rape, loot, pillage” committed
by bestial soldiers
fuelled by insatiable sexual desires (Meger, 2016, p. 1). These reductive views
of SGBV are reified through the
sterility of legally permissible language.
Contrary to the categorisation of SGBV as an “invasion” of the
body, the Elements of Crimes suggests a lack of consent
need not be proven as
the environment and conditions of conflict are intrinsically coercive (
Statute Article
Rome Statute Article
8(2)(e)(vi)). Despite
this rule, the court relied upon legally permissible language when discussing
acts of sexual violence, including
“penetration of her vagina with his
penis” (ICC-01/05-01/08-3343, p. 230), “forced to have sex”
(ICC-02/04-01/15-1762,
p. 69), “sexual intercourse”
(ICC-02/04-01/15-176, p. 69), “forcible sexual encounter”
(ICC-02/04-01/15-1762,
p. 750), “sexual experiences”
(ICC-02/04-01/15-1762, p. 759) and “sexual relations”
(ICC-02/04-01/15-1762,
p 810). The sterility of legal language conflicts with
traumatic experiences, as it tends to “engender oppressive and deleterious
effects”, further perpetuating injustice (Henry et al., 2015, p. 5).
However, sexualisation is intrinsic to violent colonial
logics, as “while
Black male sexuality is demonised as bestial and predatory Black female
sexuality is structured as its counterpart,
namely as always already raped and
therefore unrapeable both in law and in social understanding” (Coetzee
& du Toit, 2018,
p. 220-221). This mutation of harm raises a crucial
question: Can the law ever prevent rape, or can it only fortify racial, gender
and sexual difference and rape culture? Lawfare is further evidenced by the
perpetual blurring of responsibility for child soldiers:
children under the age
of 15 who are recruited and used by an armed force (
UN Rome Statute,
Article 8[b-xxvi]).
ICL is predicated upon binaries: “innocent” and
“guilty”, “good” and “evil” and
and “perpetrator”. This rigidity is challenged
by the phenomenon of the child soldier, a complex victim-survivor framed
of these binaries, often simultaneously, yet confined within narratives of
criminality (Kan, 2018). Within the data, the
ICC oscillated between referring
to child soldiers as “abductees”, “fighters”,
“recruits” and
“attackers”, without dictating when an
abducted child becomes criminally responsible. This inconsistency reflects
of child soldiers as either “passive victims” or
“dangerous demons”, which decontextualise, essentialise
exoticise children, often through racialised narratives (Steinl, 2017, p. 9).
These binary logics exacerbate the harm faced by
children in war-affected
territories, whilst exonerating the court of its failure to protect these
children. Lawfare is equally discernible
through the rigidity of arbitrary
temporal and spatial parameters.
The ICC conceptualises the flux of war and peace as disjunctive, requiring
harmful acts to occur within arbitrary temporal and spatial
parameters to be
labelled as international violations. This narrow view has significant
implications. It overlooks the ongoing and
protracted nature of many conflicts
(Azar, 1990) and it separates war from peace through the lens of the men who
wage it, ignoring
the oppression of women and the heightened subjugation of
civilians in “post”-conflict societies (Hynes, 2004). Further,
prioritises legal formalities in place of traumatic experiences. This is
exemplified by the following excerpt from the Bemba Gombo
Mr Bemba argues that the allegation of rape by MLC soldiers in the CAR
between on or about 26 October 2002 and 15 March 2003 would
not be sufficiently
specific and that “[w]ithout the inclusion of any other factual details,
it would be a rape charge with
[a] 141-day time frame covering a geographic area
of approximately 623,000 square [kilometers]”. (ICC-01/05-01/08-3636, p.
In this instance, the Defence exploited these parameters through highlighting
their obscenity. This position was reinforced in the
Ongwen case, as the Trial
Chamber dismissed a woman who was held captive by the LRA as she “was not
held captive in Sinia,
[so] her personal experience does not directly fall
within the charges” (ICC-02/04-01/15-1762, p. 158). Through a patriarchal
lens, the court overlooks the continuum of violence experienced by civilians in
conflict zones. The onus upon specificity reflects
lawlessness
of ICL; its evidentiary standards demand precise details of
events that occur in disorder, which hinders investigations and evidence
gathering efforts (Cockburn, 2004). The court has faced criticism for its
neglect of SGBV when investigating atrocities, often failing
to consider the
gendered experiences of these acts and the stigmatisation attached to both
victim-survivors and perpetrators (Luping,
2009; SáCouto & Cleary,
2009). The court’s emphasis on strict legal frameworks and narrow
the incompatibility between normative judicial
mechanisms and the complex realities of wartime. This disconnection perpetuates
against victim-survivors while simultaneously demonising and
racialising those held responsible.
Othering and Ostracisation
ICL has oppressive and harmful effects, and its application by the court
others and ostracises victim-survivors and those accused
of atrocities. This
process transforms the ICC into a producer and reproducer of harm, violence and
trauma, which reinforces systemic
harms such as patriarchy, sexism, racism and
misogyny. This
othering and ostracisation
is facilitated through the
harms of adversarial mechanisms, which segregate experiences of violence as
exceptional, exposing the
logics of coloniality which sexualise and demonise
Black and Brown bodies (Lugano, 2017; Odinkalu, 2015). This theme suggests
coloniality
is sustained through ICL, as “law and order” is wielded
to pacify and control, and binds notions of government to those
of domination.
The Rome Statute (1998) and the Rules of
Procedure and Evidence (2013) embed victim participation within ICC proceedings,
court the first with international jurisdiction to integrate
victim-oriented functions within its mandate (Shimoyachi, 2014). Whilst
scholars marked this shift as a restorative turn toward victim-centric justice,
others remained cynical, suggesting restorative
practices distract the court
from punishing those responsible (Kendall, 2015; Moffett, 2015). This disparity
reflects the “punitive
and restorative function” of the court and,
despite the implied reciprocity between these functions, the analysis suggests
victim-centric practices are secondary to retributive procedures (International
Criminal Court [ICC], 2013, p. 6). This hierarchy
is embedded within criminal
proceedings as victims are categorised by evidentiary value, with their stories
extracted to produce
probative legal narratives (Mertus, 2004; SáCouto
& Cleary, 2009). The harm of this duality is evidenced by the court’s
distinction between “witnesses”, who provide legally binding
testimony, and “victims”, who present their
concerns”. Victim-survivors must be “natural persons who have
suffered harm as a result of the commission
of any crime within the jurisdiction
of the court” to provide evidence (Rules of Procedure and Evidence, 2013,
p. 31). The
concept of “harm” remains contentious, reinforcing the
hierarchisation of the “ideal victim” within international
testimony of victim-survivors of SGBV is integral to international criminal
trials, yet victim-survivors must navigate feminised,
infantilised and
racialised stereotypes to achieve the complete and legitimate status of being a
victim (Kendall & Nouwen, 2013;
Schwöbel-Patel, 2018). This
“ideal victim” archetype, a concept popularised by Christie (1986),
imposes value hierarchies
on victimhood and positions some individuals as more
deserving of the status than others. In international justice, the “ideal
victim” is portrayed as weak, vulnerable and dependent, with their
experiences grotesquely spectacularised. Critics argue that
this abstract
representation has enabled “the creation of a deity-like and seemingly
sovereign entity, “The Victim”
which transcends all actual
victims” and fails to reflect their specific realities (Kendall &
Nouwen, 2013, p. 241; Schwöbel-Patel
2018). This cannot be separated from
the probative value attached to such experiences, which hierarchises trauma
based on legal permissibility
and evidentiary standards and limits the
“witnesses” deemed worthy of providing testimony. Within the Bemba
Gombo case,
5,229 victims were “authorised to participate” in
the case, yet only one victim-survivor of SGBV provided testimony before
chamber (ICC-01/05-01/08, p. 16). Similarly, in the Ongwen case, 4,095 victims
“participated in proceedings”, but
only seven testified about their
experiences of SGBV (ICC-02/04-01/15, p. 14). This disparity underscores the
hierarchy of harm which
simultaneously frames some violence as exceptional,
while ostracising the “victims” who do not meet such criteria. It
equally speaks to the incompatibility of normative judicial mechanisms designed
to prosecute one individual for widespread and systematic
violence, which is
further exacerbated by the antagonism of the adversarial process (St. Germain
& Dewey, 2013).
The ICC has instituted a range of mechanisms intended to protect
victim-survivors who provide testimony at the court, yet these measures
compensate for the harms innate to adversarial mechanisms (Rules of Procedure
and Evidence, 2013).
The legal doctrine of “due process”, intended to balance the
rights of the accused with those of victim-survivors, has
institutionalised the disempowerment of victim-survivors through legitimating
the dispute of their experiences. Research
suggests adversarial
cross-examination and law-premised questions reduce victim testimony to
probative value and reveal an innate
tension between the recollection of
traumatic experiences and the production of legal meaning (Viebach, 2017). While
adversarial
mechanisms silence and undermine, victim-survivors seek
participation, voice and validation, and this contestion occurred throughout
both cases (Powell, 2015). To assert the innocence of their clients, both
defence teams attacked the credibility of victim-survivors
and their testimony.
In the Ongwen case,
the Defence stated the testimony of a victim-survivor
was “riddled with contradictions”
(ICC-02/04-01/15-1762, p.
107), while in the Bemba
Gombo case, it was labelled as “incapable
of belief” (ICC-01/05-01/08-3343, pp. 228-234).
The denigration within the Bemba
Gombo case is compounded as only one
victim-survivor of SGBV testified before the court: a woman who gave evidence of
two incidents
of sexual assault by 14 individuals. Her testimony was elicited
through questions including “Where were you raped? Was it on
a bed? Was it
on the ground? Where was it?”, “You said that the others looked on
as you were being raped. How many of
them would you say were looking on as you
were being raped? What was their reaction?” and “Did they take turns
you, or did it happen that two soldiers would rape you at the same
time?” The violence of these questions is diametric to the
profound pain
expressed in her testimony, which concluded with “they abused me. They
took turns freely, as they wished”.
The disentangling of this violence
reveals a colonial narrative which frames the “third world woman” as
“thoroughly
disempowered, brutalised and victimised” and depicts the
“native” man as perverse with an unruly sexuality (Kapur,
15; Oyĕwùmí, 1997). These adversarial mechanisms not only
expose the inseparability of racial and sexual
inferiorisation within the
colonial project but they equally demonstrate how the dissection of traumatic
experiences sensationalises
and eroticises sexual violence. The combination of
these factors produces patriarchal dominance comparable to that which underpins
SGBV (Coetzee & du Toit, 2018; Lugones, 2007). These enduring logics of
coloniality are evidenced through the eurocentrism of
the court, which
prioritises white voices while segregating the violence of the “war
criminal” as exceptional.
The ICC is entangled within matrices of power
shaped by coloniality and eurocentrism, with the analysis suggesting this
relationship
is mutually constitutive. At the core of this cycle is the
court’s mandate which overlooks the origins of violence, simultaneously
relegating atrocities as inexplicable whilst maintaining the colonial distortion
of the “native” as predatory “animals,
uncontrollably sexual
and wild” (Lugones, 2010, p. 743). Within the data, these logics created a
caricature of the “war
criminal”: a senselessly evil creature,
devoid of humanity, who is violent beyond reason. This process categorised the
as intrinsically culpable, detaching them from their environment, their
experiences and themselves.
In the Ongwen case, the ICC weaponised colonial and carceral logics and
reduced the accused to a caricature of the “war criminal”.
provides countless references to the “coercive environment” of the
LRA, but failed to consider the impact these
conditions, nor his abduction as a
child, may have had upon Ongwen’s behaviour. Instead, he was found liable
as he “committed
the relevant crimes when he was an adult”,
reinforcing binary and carceral logics and individualising criminal behaviour as
removed from its environment (ICC-02/04-01/15, p. 17). This narrative was
further compounded by testimony describing Ongwen as a
“very simple
person, who was down to earth” (ICC-02/04-01/15, p. 887) and “highly
loved by his people and he was
also a very loving person ... very relaxed and
easy to work with” (ICC-02/04-01/15, p. 886). Rather than engaging with
characterisations, the court addressed them solely to dismiss claims of
diminished responsibility, implying that one cannot be simultaneously
and “criminal”. The caricaturing of the “war criminal”
was deepened by the refusal to acknowledge
the precipitating factors which
underpinned Ongwen’s behaviour.
The Defence argued Ongwen’s innocence due to diminished responsibility,
citing his abduction by, and prolonged entrenchment
within, the LRA. Ugandan
experts, Professor Emilio Ovuga and Dr. Dickens Akena, diagnosed Ongwen with
post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), severe depression and dissociative
disorders after working closely with him to assess his mental state. However,
their findings
were dismissed as “it is not the role of a forensic expert
to sustain a relationship of trust and confidence with the person
to be examined
for the court”
(ICC-02/04-01/15, p. 893). In contrast, the court
relied on psychiatrists who never met Ongwen and based their diagnoses on video
assessments. This approach was particularly problematic given the limited
understanding shown of the diverse impacts of the coercive
militia environment,
as illustrated by one expert’s statement:
These symptoms are so severe and so intrusive that they stop the individual
from being able to carry on with their normal day-to-day
functioning. They
cannot work. They cannot study. They cannot lead normal family lives. They
don’t interact with their friends.
All their – all their functioning
is significantly impaired.
(ICC-02/04-01/15, p. 875)
The prosecution witness Professor Gillian Mezey’s statement highlights
the absurdity of assessing trauma through the lens of
“normal day-to-day
functioning.” Her comments, including “people that suffer from PTSD
tend to avoid trauma reminders”,
“the individual would become
socially withdrawn” and “the majority of individuals exposed to
trauma do not go on
to develop PTSD”, fail to address the complex
realities of conflict (ICC-02/04-01/15, pp. 874–881). They disregard the
pervasive threat of death for those deemed insubordinate within the LRA and
overlook the psychological toll of abduction, torture
and being forced to become
a child soldier. This failure to recognise and legitimise these conditions
exposes intersecting colonial
and carceral logics at the core of the
court’s mandate, which were equally present in the Bemba
In the Bemba Gombo case
the court placed significant weight on
whether the accused’s actions were deemed “genuine”,
transforming this term
into a marker of morality: “the measures taken were
... not “genuine” ... his primary intention was not to genuinely
take all necessary and reasonable measures within his material ability to
prevent or repress the commission of crimes” (ICC-01/05-01/08-3343,
47). At the core of these measures was the Mondonga Inquiry, which was
instituted by Bemba Gombo to investigate war crimes allegedly
committed by his
subordinates. The court condemned the inquiry as it did not pursue reports of
SGBV and resulted in a mere seven
soldiers facing trial. Yet, these efforts bear
paradoxical resemblance to international justice responses to SGBV and, at the
were arguably more successful than the ICC. This juxtaposition reflects
the binary colonial logics which perpetuate the historical
demonisation of Black
men as inherently evil while denying their capacity for duality and humanity.
This othering is further evidenced
through the prioritisation of European
“African conflict” experts.
Eurocentrism and coloniality are sustained through the norms of criminal
justice, which deify whiteness whilst positioning Blackness
as the antithesis
(Thusi, 2022). This tension permeated the data, particularly in the
prioritisation of white European “experts”
who testified as to the
geopolitical conditions in Uganda and the use of westernised psychiatric tools.
In the Ongwen case, expert
testimony on the origins and operations of the LRA,
the economic and security conditions of their camps, and the mental health
of SGBV and child conscription was provided by white male academics from
institutions such as the London School of Economics, the
University of Cambridge
and Stanford University. Perspectives from Ugandan academics were conspicuously
absent. This eurocentric
courtroom culture, founded on the prioritisation of
white credibility and authority, is reinforced by the systematic discrediting
Black witnesses and experts with lived experience and further glorified
Gender and race were constitutive functions within the logic of colonialism
and entrenched sexual violence within the symbolic and
physical possession of
land, bodies and minds of those viewed as inferior (Jordan, 2024; Morgensen,
2012). The literature intertwines
sexual domination within the colonial project,
which “sexualised Indigenous lands and people as violable” and
imperialists to both “civilise” and “save” the
supposedly inferior groups (Anderson, 2000; Morgensen, 2012,
p. 4; Smith, 2005).
This iterative process is innate to international justice, which constructs
those responsible as barbaric, savage
and animalistic, resembling the
stereotypes of inferiority and violence weaponised to support the colonial legal
narratives which
justified enslavement and empire (Coetzee & du Toit, 2018;
Lopez, 2022). The research links the conflicts of modern Africa to
the violence
of colonialism, yet consideration of such a relationship falls outside the
mandate of the court (Zeleza, 2008). Given
colonial violence is concealed
through hyperbole, the caricature of the “war criminal” may be an
illusion to conceal
the violent logics of coloniality which survive through the
In her gendered analysis of the continuum of violence, Cockburn (2004)
identifies three key factors driving conflict: economic distress,
militarisation
and ideological divides. A broad examination of the Bemba Gombo
Ongwen cases supports this framework, but this research demonstrates that these
factors are not isolated; they are part of a historic
cycle of violence. This
cycle underscores the precariousness of relying on normative and colonial
institutions as solutions to harm.
The prison represents the final stage of this
cycle—an inherently violent institution that encapsulates the multifaceted
of international justice. While Bemba Gombo was acquitted and
released, Ongwen was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment. Having
abducted at age 9 years, and arrested at 39, this amounts to 55 years of his
life spent without self-determination or freedom.
This was reiterated by Ongwen
in his statement during his sentencing hearing, “since the LRA abducted me
27 years ago, I was
already in jail ... I am still in jail. Now, if you add all
these years, almost 36 years I am still in jail” (ICC-02/04-01/15-T-261,
p. 26). Carceral responses fail to address the root causes of atrocities, and
instead obscure and perpetuate harm. Given the ongoing
prevalence of SGBV, and
atrocities more broadly, this study presents an opportunity to challenge
structural oppression through abolitionist
The principles of AF and TJ emphasise liberation, accountability and
collective action, to create systems of repair to interrupt and
transform harm
(Barrie, 2020). Core to this is
, to shatter the logic of
violence as isolated and instead address conflict through strengthening
community ties (Barrie, 2020). However,
this study suggests the ICC views such
relationality through the parochial and exclusionary lens of the
“international community”,
a colonial construct which can be
confronted through localised and culture-specific dispute resolution mechanisms
amongst those most
impacted (Gready & Robins, 2014). To echo Lajul (2016),
“true justice in the context of armed conflicts should help to
wounds created by wars; mend broken hearts, revive dampened spirits and restore
social relations torn apart by conflicts”
While this research may paint a solemn picture of international justice, it
is an image commensurate with hope and compassion. This
praxis refuses to
“let go of the visionary - that which does not yet exist — and the
radicalness of the imaginary as
a space for what is yet unthinkable, at the edge
of the possible” (Davis et al., 2022, p. 27). This project elucidates the
paradoxical and enduring logics of coloniality intrinsic to international
justice, yet it does not provide definitive answers. Instead,
it cultivates a
haven within the ambiguity and embraces the hope and potential in imagination.
It does, however, acknowledge our
interdependence and shared vulnerabilities to
envision a future of transformative responses to harm.
