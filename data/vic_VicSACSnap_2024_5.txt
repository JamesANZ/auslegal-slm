Sentencing Snapshot 289: Sentencing Trends for Recklessly Causing Serious
Injury in the Higher Courts of Victoria 2018-19 to 2022-23
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of
recklessly causing serious injury in the County and Supreme Courts of Victoria
(the higher courts) from 2018-19
Adjustments made by
the Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at June 2023 have been
incorporated into the data in this Snapshot.
Detailed data on recklessly causing serious injury and other offences is also
available on
A person who recklessly causes serious injury to another person without
lawful excuse is guilty of this offence. Recklessly causing
serious injury is an
indictable offence that carries a maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment
and/or a fine of 1,800 penalty
It can be tried
summarily in the Magistrates' Court if certain criteria are
If the offence was committed on or after 28 October 2018 and the victim was
on duty as an emergency worker, custodial officer or youth
justice worker, it is
a category 1 offence, meaning courts must almost always impose a custodial
This Snapshot focuses on cases where recklessly causing serious injury was
the principal offence, that is, cases where recklessly
causing serious injury
was the offence that received the most severe
Recklessly causing serious injury was the principal offence in 2.1% of cases
sentenced in the higher courts between 2018-19 and 2022-23.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic particularly in the 2020-21 and 2021-22
years. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced in the period after March 2020 may be lower than in other years
because the pandemic caused delays
in court proceedings
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases in that period and
therefore higher imprisonment rates than in
other years
prison sentences
may be shorter during that period than in other years to reflect the combined
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the
justice system and
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2018-19 to 2022-23, 179 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of recklessly causing serious
Figure 1 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
recklessly causing serious injury by financial year. There
were 50 people
sentenced for this offence in 2022-23, up from 38 in the previous year. The
number of people sentenced was highest
in 2022-23 (50 people) and lowest in
2020-21 (29 people).
There were also 2 people who received a custodial supervision order and 3
people who received a non-custodial supervision order for
the principal offence
of recklessly causing serious injury during the five-year period. They are not
included elsewhere in this

immediate custodial sentences was lowest in 2019-20 (84.4%) and highest in
2018-19 (93.3%). Over the five-year period,
88.3% of people were given an
immediate custodial sentence.

the principal offence.
Over the five-year period, most people sentenced for recklessly causing
serious injury received a principal sentence of imprisonment

or 19 people), a youth justice centre

Principal and total effective sentences of imprisonment
The following sections analyse the use of
imprisonment for the principal offence of recklessly causing serious injury from
to 2022-23.
The principal sentence describes the sentences for the offence at
The total effective sentence is the sentence imposed for all charges in a
case and applies at a
level. Where a case involves
multiple charges, the total effective sentence will be either the same as or
longer than the principal
Principal sentences of imprisonment
There were 152 principal sentences of imprisonment
for recklessly causing serious injury. Table 2 shows that 141 (92.8%) were
non-aggregate
imprisonment terms, and 11 were aggregate imprisonment
There were 33 people
who received a community correction order in addition to their imprisonment

Figure 3 shows the imprisonment lengths for the 141 non-aggregate
imprisonment terms for the principal offence of recklessly causing
injury. Imprisonment lengths ranged from 42 days to 8
while the median
imprisonment length was 3 years and 6 months.
The most common range of imprisonment lengths was 3 to less than 4 years (25
principal sentences).

in 2022-23. Over the five-year period, the

Non-parole periods
If a person is sentenced to an imprisonment term of
less than 1 year, the court cannot impose a non-parole period. For imprisonment
terms between 1 year and less than 2 years, the court has the discretion to fix
a non-parole period. For imprisonment terms of 2
years or more, the court must
impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
non-parole period, the person
must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.
Of the 152 people who were sentenced to imprisonment for the principal
offence of recklessly causing serious injury, 134 were eligible

Other offences finalised at the same hearing
Sometimes people prosecuted for recklessly causing
serious injury face multiple charges, which are finalised at the same hearing.
This section looks at the range of offences that offenders were sentenced for
alongside the principal offence of recklessly causing
serious injury.
Figure 8 shows the number of people sentenced for the principal offence of
recklessly causing serious injury by the total number of
sentenced offences per
person. The number of sentenced offences per person ranged from 1 to 18, and the
median was 2 offences. There
were 70 people (39.1%) sentenced for the single
offence of recklessly causing serious injury. The average number of offences per
person was 3.1.
