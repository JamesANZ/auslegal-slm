Respondent: Minter
appellant, Mr Ilea, seeks an order from the Tribunal that he receive a $500,000
award for harassment. He complains that the learned
President was wrong to
strike out his Notice of Dispute where he agitated such an argument. The learned
President was correct to
strike out the Notice of Dispute, no error of law was
made out. Our reasons follow.
Ilea has accepted claims for compensable injuries pursuant to the
There has already been
litigation in this Tribunal in relation to those
26 February 2015 Mr Ilea lodged a Notice of Dispute in the Tribunal. The section
of his Notice to identify the date of the disputed
decision was left blank and
in the section for the reasons for the dispute Mr Ilea wrote: “Please see
were three documents; first, a two page handwritten letter from Mr Ilea, dated
24 February 2015; second was a copy of a decision
of Gallagher Bassett Services
Workers Compensation SA, dated 8 October
; and third was a copy of a
WorkCover SA Income Maintenance Payment Advice document, dated 14 January
first attachment is a discursive letter from Mr Ilea of 24 February 2015 in
which he makes reference to his accepted injuries,
his litigation, reviews of
his weekly payments, his discussions with WorkCover, his involvement with the
Supreme Court and his desire
for monetary compensation. In relation to the later
he records:
“This time I am now asking WorkCover for $500,000
award for my harassment claim, caused by bullying and harassment, claim no.
35789314/00 claim that is still valid.”
this letter, Mr Ilea makes no mention of the also attached 8 October 2014
decision. There is however a passing reference to a decision
purportedly of the
WorkCover Corporation dated 21 January 2015. If there was such a decision, it
has not been brought to the attention
of the Tribunal in these proceedings.
second attachment is the decision of 8 October 2014, being an annual review
under section 39 of the Act, which adjusted Mr Ilea’s
notional weekly
earning upwards by a 3.1% increase.
third attachment is not a reviewable
and is not relevant to
these proceedings.
to its obligation to reconsider its “decision” in light of matters
set out in the Notice of Dispute,
the respondent confirmed its s 39 decision of 8 October 2014, saying that the
decision was correct in fact and
No doubt the respondent took
the view that the decision in dispute was its decision of 8 October 2014 as Mr
Ilea had attached that
document to his Notice of Dispute. However, the precise
decision, and its relevant date, which Mr Ilea was actually seeking a review
was not easily discernible given that he had not identified a decision in his
Notice of Dispute and his attached letter containing
his reasons for dispute did
not specify a decision, or date thereof, that he was actually disputing.
Conciliation
took place in accordance with the
but no conciliated outcome was
able to be achieved. The dispute was referred into the Tribunal for a judicial
determination.
At that phase,
before the President, the respondent advised that it intended to file an
application seeking an order to strike out
Mr Ilea’s Notice of Dispute for
want of jurisdiction. That application was
attaching a supporting
affidavit from Ms Carman,
solicitor with the conduct of the dispute for the respondent.
respondent’s strike out argument had two limbs; first, it was said that
nothing in the grounds for dispute indicated that
Mr Ilea was disputing the s 39
decision of 8 October 2014 and as such that decision was not the subject matter
of his dispute; second,
that his requests for an award of $500,000 for
harassment was an issue that was beyond the jurisdiction of the
to the first limb, during argument before the learned President Mr Ilea
confirmed that whilst he had put [in] a copy of the s 39
, that he was not
disputing it, he further clarified that by saying:
“All I want to hear is about the harassment claim.
I put in [the] Notice of Dispute regarding the harassment claim. I referred
section 39, as I said before, I referred to it,
I wasn’t disputing
(our emphasis)
the first limb being confirmed by Mr Ilea, the remaining argument before the
learned President was whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction
to make any award of
$500,000 to him for harassment.
way of written orders dated 3 July 2015, the learned President’s decision
was to simply strike out Mr Ilea’s Notice
of Dispute for want of
Whilst the simple decision
of no jurisdiction should be able to be understood without lengthy or elaborate
reasons, a brief analysis
of the issues involved in this matter would have been
appropriate. Nevertheless, Mr Ilea’s complaint on appeal was not one
inadequate reasons.
Ilea’s Notice of Appeal - from the learned President’s orders of
3 July 2015 - seeks the relief of: “I want
compensation as a form of
an award of $500,000...”
However, in neither his Notice of Appeal, nor in his address to us, did Mr Ilea
identify any error of law in the learned President’s
His mistaken belief
that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to make an award for harassment was, as it
has been, at the heart of his submissions.
may have been a causative feature of Mr Ilea’s accepted mental injuries,
but it does not follow that he has an entitlement
to a monetary award for
harassment that can be ordered by this Tribunal. Compensation can only be
ordered in accordance with the
legislation. Indeed, the Act specifically
excludes any entitlement to a non-economic loss lump sum for mental injuries,
whether those
injuries are caused by harassment or
Similarly, the Tribunal is
not possessed of any jurisdiction to make an award for harassment, whether for
$500,000 or any other amount,
in the nature of civil damages or such like.
Tribunal can only award the compensation that the Act provides for. It can award
compensation for medical and like expenses reasonably
incurred. Subject to the
Act it can award compensation for weekly payments of income maintenance during
periods of incapacity for
work. Subject to the worker meeting the requisite
criteria, it can award compensation for permanent impairments. Whilst the
can agree amongst themselves to convert a future liability to a lump
sum, apart from death claims, the Tribunal does not have the
award any other form of lump sum compensation.
Accordingly,
the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to award the compensation that Mr Ilea seeks.
It follows that the learned President
was correct in holding that Mr
Ilea’s Notice of Dispute should be struck out. The appeal must therefore
