Welcome to Issue 18 of the Court of Conscience.
The theme for this year is ‘Changing With the Times: Progress and Law
Reform’, which explores key areas of the law within
the 21st century that
require continued consideration for the future. This curated selection of 17
articles delivers a concise but
nuanced snapshot of some of the key issues that
continue to impact our broader community and society at large. It places us
the context of a rapidly developing world that is fraught with
innovation, tension and emerging developments. Naturally, it seems
appropriate
to anticipate that with time, our laws should adjust to bridge this gap and
reflect changing community values. When one
thinks of law reform, one way to
describe its function is the modernisation of law. This involves the act of
‘bringing it into
accord with current conditions; the elimination of
defects in the law; the simplification of law; and the adoption of new or more
effective methods for administering the law and dispensing
At the same time,
we need to continue to gauge what is working and what requires further
improvement. Law reform is an iterative
process. Each of the articles in this
issue contribute to scholarship by discussing both how far we have come, and
also how much
further we have yet to go.
Issue 18 commences with a foreword by the Honourable Tom Bathurst, the
Chairperson of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission, who
emphasises that
the process of law reform requires iterative consultation and
knowledge-gathering. We then launch into the first
suite of articles that
explore the intersection between law and human rights. The Honourable Kirby
encourages lawmakers to have greater
consideration of individuals from
non-majoritarian sexual orientation and gender identity groups to address issues
concerning basic
human rights needs. Emeritus Professor Rosalind Croucher
reinforces the need for Australia to implement a Human Rights Act to ensure
continued compliance with our international law obligations. Lorraine Finlay,
Patrick Hooton and Andrea Olivares Jones observe that
the right to privacy may
be increasingly corroded and that further safeguards are required to address
this gap, particularly for
neurotechnologies. Sophie Farthing considers
developments in Australia’s approach to regulating AI and concludes that
international
human rights law would provide a helpful framework to design our
own bespoke regulations in this area.
Three articles then discuss the interaction between the law, nature or
climate-related concerns, and rights-focused or private economic
initiatives.
The Honourable Justice Preston discusses the right to a clean, healthy and
sustainable environment and suggests that
reform is required to ensure that the
correlative obligations to protect and fulfil this right are upheld. Dr Faith
Gordon reframes
the climate crisis as a child rights crisis that will greatly
impact young people, and advocates for the law to continue addressing
issues. Courtney Hall examines the Nature Repair Market Initiative to
demonstrate the complexity in incentivising private investment
conservation while also ensuring environmental protection and socioeconomic
development.
The next few articles extend our deep dive into Australian policy. Two
articles pinpoint areas in the law that require amendment to
better align with
and reflect the interests of Indigenous peoples. Dr Bryan Keon-Cohen reviews
leading domestic and international
case law to note that Australian courts have
refrained from extending fiduciary law principles to Crown-Indigenous relations,
could be remedied via either constitutional reform or treaty initiatives.
Mahlia Garay, Lucy-Ann Kelley, Annaliese Gielingh evaluate
the significance of
adopting legislative reforms that would require judicial officers to consider
the known risks of harm to an Aboriginal
child of being removed from their
parents or carer in child protection matters.
The following four articles assess diverse aspects of social policy. Vicki
McNamara and Professor Michael Legg consider how legal
service reforms in the
United Kingdom and Utah as initiatives could inspire Australian reform to
address the gap between legal services
and unmet legal needs. Dr Sonya Willis
explores the potential for tax reforms to adopt technological innovation and
assist taxpayers
in a manner that does not exacerbate societal inequity. Dr
Sarah Ailwood observes the impact of piecemeal reforms of Australian defamation
laws on victim-survivors of gender-based violence in light of the #MeToo
movement, concluding that reform is needed to protect the
ability to speak.
Professor Penny Crofts reviews existing barriers to criminal law prosecutions
against corporations and urges for
a renewed enforcement and willingness to
prosecute corporate crime.
The final suite of articles reviews recent developments in technology.
Professor Jeannie Paterson focuses on the need for greater
transparency
regarding AI-generated images and bots to complement existing legislation on
consumer protection. On a related note,
Dr Gregor Urbas scrutinises recent
reforms that have aimed to regulate AI-generated material and notes the
limitations in how this
will address concerns about deepfake sexual imagery. Dr
Niamh Kinchin pushes for further risk-based regulation to address potential
threats by using algorithmic risk assessments in the immigration process. Dr
Gunther Teubner and Dr Anna Beckers close Issue 18 by
lending an international,
cross-disciplinary perspective on the complexity of technological laws.
Issue 18 would not have been possible without everyone who has been involved
in the process from start to finish. I express my sincere
thanks and gratitude
to the authors of this journal for their contributions to this year’s
theme and for entrusting our publication
with their works. It has been an honour
to work with you and I hope you are proud of our accomplishment. I extend my
thanks to the
anonymous peer reviews for taking their time to provide insightful
Bathurst for kindly agreeing to pen this year’s foreword for Issue 18 and
for providing invaluable insights on law
reform. We are honoured to have your
support in leading our discussion on these important issues.
With the Court of Conscience now in its 18
year of publication,
I was immensely pleased when I realised the number ‘18’ is
considered to be a lucky number in many
cultures, including my own. I certainly
feel lucky to have been able to work alongside such a hard-working and dedicated
student-led
Editorial Team for Issue 18. As my time as Editor in Chief draws to
a close, I cannot thank each of you enough for your unmatched
knowledge and assistance to the Journal. It has been wonderful having you on the
team. I am grateful that the Court of
Conscience has the backing of the
University of New South Wales Law Society and the Law and Justice faculty. In
particular, I would
like to give a shout out to the Faculty’s Dean Andrew
Lynch, Law Society Co-Presidents Bhavik Aggarwal and Lihara Delungahawatte,
Vice President (Social Justice) Imandi Mudugamuwa for their continued support of
the journal. A massive thank you to our artist,
Darshni Rajasekar, for providing
the beautiful illustrations that complement the journal, and to the graphic
designer Helaina Clare
for putting together our publication. Finally, I thank my
friends and family for being with me every step of the way.
The law is ever-changing. It ebbs and flows in parallel to emerging
developments that continue to affect our world. I hope the reader
enjoys this
insight into what further change could look like and the ripple effects that the
law continues to have on society.
