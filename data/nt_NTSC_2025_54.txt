CORAM: GRANT
REASONS FOR DECISION
(Delivered 8 August 2025)
[1] The second
defendant seeks an order for its costs of these proceedings brought by the
plaintiff seeking to quash the decision
of the first defendant to approve an
Environment Management Plan (‘EMP’) allowing the second defendant to
conduct regulated
activity under an exploration permit, and to restrain the
second defendant from conducting any activity in reliance on the decision
EMP. The first defendant does not seek any order for costs against the
Procedural history
[2] The grounds
upon which the plaintiff sought those orders involved: (a) the proper
construction of certain provisions of the
Petroleum (Environment) Regulations
(NT) concerning the extent of the environmental impacts and risks
required to be addressed in the EMP; (b) the lawfulness of the first
defendant’s satisfaction that the EMP included details of the
environmental impacts and environmental risks required by the
provisions; (c) the correctness of the first defendant’s finding that the
EMP contained an assessment of the environmental
impacts which might arise
directly or indirectly from an emergency situation; and (d) the first
defendant’s power to approve
the EMP without reference to the Northern
Territory Environment Protection Agency.
[3] The parties
agreed that those
grounds could be tried and
determined as preliminary questions pursuant to r 47.05 of the
Court Rules 1987
(NT), and that the answers to those questions would also be
determinative of the plaintiff’s application for particular discovery
documents, the relevance of which was contingent on the correctness of the
plaintiff’s interpretation of the governing legislation.
Following the
trial of those preliminary questions:
(a) the first ground failed on the basis that the legislative scheme did not
require the EMP for exploration stage activities to
address the environmental
impacts and risks associated with potential future production
(b) the second ground failed on the basis that in approving the EMP the first
defendant was not required to consider broader questions
of whether the
exploration, production and utilisation of hydrocarbons causes unsustainable
greenhouse gas emissions, and the causes
and consequences of unsustainable
(c) the third ground failed on the basis that the approval of that part of the
EMP dealing with the environmental impacts and risks
of potential emergency
conditions could not be characterised as irrational or
(d) the fourth ground failed on the dual basis that, on proper construction of
the scheme, the first defendant was permitted to approve
the EMP in the absence
of a referral to the Environment Protection Agency and a determination that an
environmental impact assessment
was required, and that the question whether the
proposed action was required to be referred to the Environment Protection Agency
is not an objective jurisdictional fact capable of determination in judicial
review proceedings.
The general rule
[4] The purpose
of a costs order is to compensate the person in whose favour it is made, rather
than to punish the person against
whom the order is
The general rule is that if
the court makes any order as to costs, it is to order that the costs follow the
event unless it appears
that some other order should be made having regard to
the circumstances.
That general
rule is based on the principle that justice is not achieved if the party who is
responsible for others incurring the
costs of litigation does not bear those
costs. The second defendant had a substantive legal right to vindicate in its
the proceedings. Where, as in this case, the second defendant has
been successful, it is the plaintiff who has been responsible for
incurred. That is because it has sought to impugn decisions made validly by the
first defendant and to deny the second
defendant something to which it was
The second defendant’s contentions on
[5] Against that
background, the second defendant’s submissions in support of an order that
the plaintiff pay the costs of and
incidental to the proceedings may be
summarised briefly as follows. The plaintiff brought the proceedings for the
purpose of preventing
or delaying the second defendant’s petroleum
exploration activities in furtherance of its general and overriding opposition
to fracking activity, rather than because it had any primary concern about the
details contained in the EMP.
responding to the plaintiff’s challenge, the second defendant was required
to commission its own expert report in response
to the expert evidence filed by
the plaintiff. After the plaintiff had filed its expert evidence, it then
brought an application
for particular discovery which was both misconceived and
oppressive given the scope and indeterminate nature of the documents sought.
way of example, the categories of documents sought included the ‘best
estimates’ of the future petroleum that might
be recovered by the second
defendant in its unknown ‘future production activities’ and
estimates of the greenhouse gas
emissions that would result from that
production.
[7] All of the
grounds of review advanced by the plaintiff (with the exception of the third
ground), and its application for particular
discovery, were founded on the
general contention that the EMP was required to address the impacts resulting
from any future production
phase despite the fact that the EMP was necessary
only for the approval of regulated activities under the exploration permit. The
plaintiff’s challenge on the first ground was plainly wrong, contrary to
express textual indications in the legislation and
inimical to the practical and
rational operation of the legislative scheme. The plaintiff’s challenge on
the second and third
grounds contended that the decisions made by the first
defendant were irrational or illogical in circumstances where it was clearly
open to a reasonable decision-maker to be satisfied that the EMP addressed the
matters required under the terms of the legislation.
The plaintiff’s
challenge on the fourth ground proceeded on fundamental misconceptions about the
operation of the statutory
scheme similar to those underlying the first and
second grounds.
plaintiff’s claim that it brought the proceedings in the ‘public
interest’ should not be allowed to obscure
the fact that ‘the
absence of a prospect of monetary gain is not to be equated with the presence of
a motive confined to
, ‘especially
if an association is incorporated precisely for the purpose of pursuing the
litigation’
Further, it should not be assumed that those claiming environmental concerns
have some monopoly over the public interest. There
is also a public interest in
social and economic development.
this case, the principal object of the legislative scheme was to encourage
petroleum exploration and production activities on
the assumption that they are
in the public interest.
[9] Even if the
proceedings are capable of characterisation as public interest litigation, the
usual order remains that costs follow
There needs to be some
additional special circumstance before the court should depart from the general
rule, and such circumstances
will be rare and
exceptional.
That special
circumstance cannot be found ‘in some general, nebulous public interest
litigation exception but rather in some
special feature of [the]
principle that there should be the expectation of a reasonable costs indemnity
in public interest litigation ‘recognises
this is necessary both to
discourage indiscriminate challenges and as a justification for an award of
costs to challengers who
[11] In the
second defendant’s ultimate submission, the first and fourth grounds of
review and the application for particular
discovery were based upon a
particularly weak premise, and there were no special circumstances operating to
displace the general
The plaintiff’s contentions on costs
plaintiff opposes the second defendant’s application for costs on the
bases that the litigation: (a) was in the public
interest and of broad public
importance; (b) was commenced to ensure compliance with the law; (c) tested
arguable and novel questions
of law of general importance; and (d) was not
conducted by the plaintiff in a way that would tend against a no-costs outcome.
[13] In making
that submission the plaintiff relies on the decision of the High Court in
Oshlack v Richmond River Council
, in which the court reversed a decision
of the New South Wales Court of Appeal which had overturned a no costs order
made by the
court at first instance. The special circumstances warranting that
result at first instance were that: (a) the applicant’s
motivation was to
ensure obedience to environmental law and the preservation of the environment;
(b) a significant proportion of
public shared the applicant’s opposition
to the proposed development; and (c) the challenge resolved significant and
issues concerning the interpretation and administration of the
statutory scheme.
The plaintiff
says that result is reflective of the modern approach taken by courts in
relation to the costs of environmental
litigation.
plaintiff says that, conversely, those parts of the second defendant’s
submissions concerning the characterisation
of, and motivations which might be
attributed to, environmental litigation, and the writings and authorities relied
upon in support
of those submissions, are concerned with a different category of
matter. A distinction is properly drawn between cases of genuine
importance and those in which the plaintiff is pursuing its own commercial or
other interests.
To the extent

is cited by the second defendant as authority for the proposition that
there is a countervailing public interest in social and economic
development,
the court in that matter determined that the litigation was prosecuted in the
public interest and made no order as to
costs for that
In doing so, the court
also observed that it was important that costs not present a barrier to the
resolution of important questions
of law in the pursuit of environmental
[15] Against
that background, the plaintiff submits that these proceedings raised difficult
questions of construction of broad application
and involved the issue of
fracking approvals in which a substantial proportion of the Northern Territory
community had a legitimate
intellectual or ideological
The plaintiff says that
it has been undertaking activities in relation to fracking activity since at
least 2015, and was not incorporated
for the purpose of pursuing this
litigation. The plaintiff is a not-for-profit association which has no
commercial or financial interest
in the outcome. The commencement of this
litigation was consistent with the plaintiff’s general activities over
that extended
period and with its concern about the environmental impacts of
fracking. The commencement of proceedings to test executive compliance
statutory scheme was in the public interest and has clarified the operation of
the scheme, particularly in relation to the
questions raised in the first and
fourth grounds. The plaintiff says that all grounds advanced by it were
‘well arguable, novel
and important’. Finally, the plaintiff submits
that it litigated the proceedings reasonably, efficiently and without undue
delay, particularly in its consent to the grounds being tried and determined as
preliminary questions in a manner determinative of
the challenge.
Determination
[16] I am unable
to accept the second defendant’s submission that because the legislative
scheme operates on the assumption
that petroleum exploration and production
activities are in the public interest, the plaintiff’s motivation in
bringing these
proceedings to prevent those activities was thereby at odds with
the principal premise of the legislative regime and the public interest
facilitating petroleum activities. The objects of the legislation also include
that petroleum exploration and production activities
are conducted in a manner
that ‘provides protection to the environment of the Territory; and
promotes principles of ecologically
sustainable
development’.
[17] They are
objects which are coordinate and commensurate with the object of fostering
economic development through the exploitation
of petroleum resources, and which
operate as a competing public interest. The commencement of proceedings to
enforce compliance with
those environmental objects cannot properly be
characterised as either the pursuit of a private interest or contrary to the
purpose of the legislation.
[18] However,
the fact that the proceedings involved a public interest aspect, or an asserted
vindication of public rights, does not,
of itself, warrant departure from the
general rule that costs follow the

High Court in that matter was considering the subject matter, scope and purpose
of a statutory
provision which vested the Land and Environment Court with the
discretion to determine by whom and to what extent costs of proceedings
it were to be paid. The relevant question was whether the Court of Appeal at
intermediate level was correct to determine that
the considerations taken into
account by the court at first instance were ‘definitely extraneous to any
objects the legislature
could have had in view’ in enacting the provision.
The answer to that question was that those considerations were not extraneous

, the Full Court of the Federal Court departed from the usual rule
on the bases that applications claiming relief from unlawful detention
not be deterred by the threat of an adverse costs order and the proceedings
raised undoubtedly difficult and important questions
of law, as illustrated by
the decision in favour of the applicants at first instance and in the dissenting
opinion of the Chief Justice
[22] Some care
needs to be taken in the analysis of the decision and reasons of the Full Court
of the Federal Court in
Environment Council of Central Queensland Inc
The court at first instance dismissed the Environment Council’s
application and ordered it to pay the proponent’s costs
of and incidental
to the application and half of the responsible Minister’s costs. In making
that order, the court accepted
that the Environment Council brought the
proceedings in the public interest and that they raised a matter of public
importance. However,
the interpretation it pressed was inconsistent with the
statutory scheme. The Full Court dismissed the Environment Council’s
appeals against both the dismissal of its substantive challenge and the awards
of costs made against it. It was in that context that
the Full Court made no
order as to the costs of the appeals on the bases that both the proponent and
the Minister would be compensated
‘to the extent they sought to be, for
the conduct of the trial’, and that the public interest role of community
organisations
is ‘an important consideration for the exercise of the costs
discretion at the appellate level in
particular’.
[23] It may be
accepted that a significant segment of the public shared the plaintiff’s
opposition to fracking activity in the
Beetaloo Basin. It may also be accepted
that the plaintiff is a community organisation which did not have any patent or
undisclosed
commercial interest in the outcome of the proceedings. However,
those two matters do not, by themselves, warrant a departure from
the general
rule as to costs. The substance of the challenge must be such as to warrant that
disposition.
[24] Against
that background, it is no doubt correct to say that the matters of construction
raised by the plaintiff had not previously
been determined by any court and have
now been resolved. It follows that the first, second and fourth grounds for
review were novel,
but that characterisation has nothing to say about the
strength of the arguments prosecuted by the plaintiff. All three of those
grounds were predicated either directly or indirectly on the proposition that
when considering the EMP for approval, the first defendant
was obliged to have
regard to the environmental impacts and risks of not just exploration
activities, but also production-phase activities.
[25] Although
the arguments mustered in support of that premise were no doubt ingenious, that
speaks more to the skill of counsel
than to the inherent strength of the
premise. Both the text of the legislation and the practical and rational
operation of the legislative
scheme plainly militated against the construction
propounded by the plaintiff. The third ground was directed to the content of the
EMP rather than the construction of the legislation and raised questions of
impression and degree rather than any important legal
issue. That the plaintiff
conducted the litigation efficiently, responsibly and in a manner which
facilitated its early resolution
does not alter those characterisations. The
fact that the plaintiff may not have acted in a way that disentitled it to a
costs order does not necessarily mean that it is entitled to that
result. That only follows if it has established special circumstances
would otherwise warrant that result. In my assessment, it has not.
[26] The second
defendant has also sought an order that its costs be certified fit for senior
and junior counsel pursuant to
rule 63.72(9)
Supreme Court Rules
(NT). The subject matter of the case and its importance for the second
defendant made the services of more than one counsel reasonably

reasons, I make the following orders:
