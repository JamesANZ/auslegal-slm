Kevin Daly v Q-Comp [2009] QIC 32; 192 QGIG 119 (5 October 2009)
[Extract from Queensland Government Industrial
dated 16 October, 2009, Vol. 192, No. 7, pages
INDUSTRIAL COURT OF QUEENSLAND
Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003
- appeal against
decision of industrial magistrate
Kevin Daly AND Q-COMP (C/2009/23)
PRESIDENT HALL
5 October 2009
By a Notice of Claim for Damages dated 10 September 2007, Kevin Daly (the
Appellant) made a claim to WorkCover Queensland for a work-related
injury. The
injury was said to have been suffered on 8 December 2004 when he fell whilst
performing work at the site of the "Melbourne
Hotel" in West End. By a letter
dated 16 January 2008, WorkCover Queensland rejected the claim. The claim was
rejected on the ground
that the Appellant was not a "worker" as defined at
Workers' Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003
(the Act). The
Appellant sought a Review of that decision. By a decision of 4 March 2008,
Q-COMP confirmed the decision of WorkCover
Queensland. On 31 March 2008, the
Appellant appealed to the Industrial Magistrates Court. By a decision dated 14
April 2009 and
delivered on that date, the Industrial Magistrates Court
dismissed the appeal. By an Application to Appeal dated 7 May 2009, the
Appellant seeks an order of this Court setting aside the decision of the
Industrial Magistrate and recognising the Appellant's entitlement
under the Act.
There may be some issue whether a 21 day time limit applies to
Act. As a matter of prudence the Appellant sought and was granted an extension
The Appellant was born on 23 November 1939. He retired from
his engagement with a Shire Council in the early to mid 1990's. Shortly
thereafter, he commenced to perform work for Daly Constructions Queensland Pty
Ltd (Daly Constructions). It is common ground that
the alter ego of Daly
Constructions is the Appellant's son, Steven Daly. The company secretary is the
Appellant's daughter-in-law,
, Mrs Jacqueline Daly.
witness in the Appellant's case was the Appellant himself. The Appellant's wife
attended at the Industrial Magistrates Court.
The Appellant's Counsel, in
opening, contemplated the possibility of calling the Appellant's wife, but in
the event, did not do
so. Consistently with the decision in
(1959) 101 CLR 295
, the Industrial Magistrate took the view that Mrs
Daly had not been called because her evidence would not have assisted the
Appellant's
The Appellant's evidence was that he had been working
for Daly Constructions for the past 14-16 years. (Steven Daly, who was called
by Q-COMP, gave evidence that the work commenced in 1996.) He told the
Industrial Magistrates Court that he worked as a general
labourer. On occasions
when he was the only person to attend at a site, he took his own tools. On
other occasions, he used tools
provided by his son. He had not been told by
Daly Constructions that he might not work for others. In fact he had not done
remuneration. He had performed voluntary work for other family members.
He asserted that his son told him what to do, but accepted
that when he declared
his unavailability for work or unwillingness to perform work, his son always
acquiesced.
As to payment, it was the evidence of the Appellant that at
irregular intervals his son would supply him with a document describing
hours which he had worked since last being paid. That document was accompanied
by a cheque which paid for those hours. The
Appellant would then supply his son
with an invoice charging for the hours worked. The invoice was prepared by the
Appellant's wife
and was in the name of L. & K. Daly. It is common ground
that L. & K. Daly is a partnership and that the partners are the
and his wife. It is also common ground that L. & K. Daly has an ABN number
and completes a BAS statement. However,
the Appellant, who claimed not to
understand what a group certificate was, asserted that he did not understand
financial matters
and left all financial and taxation matters to his wife. (One
can understand why the Industrial Magistrate was attracted to the
view that Mrs
Daly had not been called because she would not have assisted the Appellant's
case.) For completeness, I should add
that the cheque was invariably* paid into
the partnership account. [*On one occasion the money was paid by direct
transfer. The
direct transfer system was abandoned because the Appellant and
his wife were not comfortable with it.]
Steven Daly and his wife were
called as witnesses by Q-COMP. The method of payment outlined by the Appellant
was confirmed. The
peculiarity of the invoice issuing after receipt of the
cheque seems to have been regularised by post-dating the invoice. It was
Daly's evidence that Daly Constructions had no employees and that the Appellant
was a sub-contractor like everyone else.
It was also his evidence that his
father was engaged to "do what he could". Given the Appellant's age and the
family relationship,
that evidence seems to me to be entirely credible.
It must be squarely borne in mind that it was the Appellant who carried
the onus of proof. Given the inadequacy of detail relating
to the internal
affairs of the partnership in circumstances in which that detail might have been
provided, it seems to me to be entirely
unexceptional that the Industrial
Magistrate announced that His Honour was not prepared to go behind the
transaction as it appeared
to be. On the analysis that Daly Constructions had
entered into a series of contracts with a partnership trading on its own
a finding that the Appellant was a worker within
of the Act,
, "a person who works under a contract of service", was not open.
Even if that hurdle might have been overcome, the Appellant faced
another hurdle
in that the Industrial Magistrate rejected the Appellant's claim that his son
told him what work to perform and (rightly)
found that the Appellant chose his
work. Whatever role the "control test" continues to discharge in Australian
employment law, it
has always been about control not over what work is to be
performed, but over the manner of performance of the work. Here, the alleged
employer did not have control even over what work the Appellant performed. The
extended definition of "worker" at Schedule 2, Part
1 of the Act relating to
persons who work under a contract for labour only avails the Appellant not at
all. The evidence did not
go to those issues. For example, there was no
evidence that the partnership might not have engaged a third party to perform
work. If it be objected that such an approach ignores the family
relationships, the inevitable rejoinder is that if more evidence
"family" nature of the transactions had been led it may have been found that
there was no intention by any participant
to be legally bound.
dismiss the Appeal. I reserve all questions as to costs.
