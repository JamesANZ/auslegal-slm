Miller, Shane v
Queensland Harness Racing Board
[2002] QRAA 22
REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr Leo G Williams AO - Chairman
Mr Dennis Standfield -
This is an appeal by Mr Shane Richard Miller against a
decision of the Queensland Harness Racing Board Stewards that he was in breach
of Rule 163(1)(a) of the Rules of Harness Racing which provides:
“163. (1) A driver shall not -
(a) cause or contribute to any crossing, jostling or interference”
and sub rule 5 reads:
“For the purpose of sub rule (1) “crossing” occurs when a
driver changing the position of the driver’s horse
compels another runner
to shorten stride or the driver of that other horse to pull it out of its
The charge against Mr Shane Miller related to
an incident which occurred on Saturday 9 November 2002 at Albion Park Raceway
the running of Race 6 which was Heat 1 of the Member’s Cup. The
Stewards allege that on the turn into the front straight during
the run to the
finish of the race when changing the position of his horse, Power Of Fun, Mr
Shane Miller caused a tightening to the
horse Autumn Colour driven by Mr Luke
McCarthy which resulted in Autumn Colour breaking gait.

making a finding of the breach of the rule and the penalty imposed. Mr Greg
Miller presented videos of Autumn Colour’s previous galloping and other
incidents which he submits were similar but where the
Stewards did not take
action because of the horses interfered with did not gallop.
Video tapes
of the race were shown and it was clear (particularly from the video taken from
the Stewards tower) that Power of Fun
did shift and cause interference to Autumn
The Authority agrees with the Stewards that the shift and
Appellant’s Appeal against the finding of the Stewards as to a breach of
Rule163(1)(a).
In relation to the matter of penalty Mr Shane Miller is
an experienced and capable driver. Notwithstanding that he has been granted
stay of proceedings he has lost a number of drives. The Authority considers
that this is a matter in which a monetary penalty
should be imposed rather than
a suspension.
The Authority is of the opinion that the appropriate
penalty is a fine of $250.00 and imposes that penalty in lieu of the 2 weeks
suspension.
The Authority orders that the Appeal Deposit Fee is
