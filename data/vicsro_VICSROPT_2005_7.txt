Contractors - 90 Day Test (PT-119) [2005] VICSROPT 7 (1 December 2005)
Contractors --- 90 Day Test
Revenue Ruling PT.119
Replaces PT.052
Section 3C of the
Pay-roll Tax Act 1971
provides for certain contractors (whether
incorporated or not) to be deemed employees
(under what are defined as ``relevant contracts'')
and for payments to those contractors to be
treated as wages for the purposes of the Act. Most
contracts for the provision of services are ``relevant
contracts''.
However, there are six possible exemptions (prior
to 1 July 2002, there were seven possible
exemptions) that may exclude payments under
such contracts from the definition of wages. One of
the exemptions is a contract for the provision of
services by a person providing the same or similar
services to a principal under the contract for no
more than 90 days in a financial year (Section
3C(1)(e)(iii) of the Act).
The replaced Revenue Ruling PT.052 explained
the operation of this exemption and outlined an
approved method as an alternative to the 90-day
test (the Alternative Method). The Alternative
Method was based on a daily award rate according
to the abolished Victorian State award system.
In Victoria, following the abolition of the State
award system, employers and employees are
covered by the Federal workplace relations system.
Therefore, Victorian employees are subject to one
of the following working conditions:
� An Australian workplace agreement; or
� A certified agreement with an employer; or
� A Federal award; or
� A minimum wage order.
Minimum wage orders provide for minimum wage
entitlements. Currently, there are minimum wage
orders for 18 Victorian industries prescribed on
WageNet's website www.wagenet.gov.au. The
industries listed are as follows:
� Accommodation
� Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing
� Communication Services
� Construction
� Cultural and Recreational Services
� Education
� Electricity, Gas and Water Supply
� Finance and Insurance
� Government Administration and Defence
� Health and Community Services
� Manufacturing
� Personal and Other Services
� Police Services
� Property and Business Services
� Retail Trade
� Transport and Storage
� Wholesale Trade
In addition to explaining the operation of the
exemption under
Section 3C(1)(e)(iii)
of the Act, the
purpose of this ruling is to provide a revised
Alternative Method approved by the Commissioner
of the State Revenue Office (the Revised Alternative
Method) of determining the application of the 90-
day test using the prescribed minimum wage orders.
The Revised Alternative Method replaces the
Alternative Method.
If a relevant contract involves the provision of
services by a person providing the same or similar
services to a principal under the contract for no
more than 90 days in a financial year, it is an
exempt contract under
section 3C(1)(e)(iii)
Act. For the purposes of this exemption:
� the carrying out of any work on a given day
will count as a full day; and
� the days worked do not have to be
consecutive, it is the total number of days
worked during the financial year that is
Once the 90-day limit is exceeded, the total
payments made to that contractor during the
financial year, including payments made for the
work performed in the first 90 days is subject to
Pay-roll Tax. Where a principal encounters difficulty
in determining the actual number of days on which
services are rendered, the Revised Alternative
Method may be used. The Revised Alternative
Method does not require the calculation of the
number of days for which services were provided.
Revised Alternative Method
Under the Revised Alternative Method, a formula is
used to calculate the estimated remuneration a
contractor would receive for 90 days of service
from one principal. If the actual amount earned by
the contractor is less than or equal to the amount
calculated using the formula, the 90-day
exemption will be accepted as being applicable to
that contract.
The formula is Y= A x B x C x D where:
Y= The estimated remuneration for 90 days of
A= The highest hourly rate for the classification in
that industry for a full time employee
according to the minimum wage order
B= Average number of hours worked per working
C= 120 per cent (which increases the amount by
an additional 20 per cent representing the type
of payments not typically received by
contractors such as sick pay, holiday pay,
It should be noted that in comparing the actual
remuneration received by a contractor with the
estimated amount derived using the formula (i.e.
Y), the actual amount may be reduced by any
allowable prescribed deduction (please refer to
Revenue Ruling PT.066 for these deductions).
By doing this, the wages ordinarily payable to an
employee for 90 days is compared with the labour-
only component of the actual amounts paid to the
contractor in question.
New Homes Pty Ltd engaged a ceiling plasterer to
perform a contract under which the total
remuneration is $18,000 (exclusive of GST), which
included the supply of various materials needed for
the job. The ceiling plasterer worked for New

Labour-only Component of Contract Price
The actual labour-only component after subtracting
20 per cent (deduction allowable for wall and
ceiling plasterers according to Revenue Ruling
PT.066) is calculated as follows:
$18,000 minus $3,600 (being 20 per cent of
$18,000) = $14,400
Minimum Wage Equivalent
According to WageNet, the industry sector that best
matches the work undertaken by ceiling plasterers is
the Construction industry. The highest hourly rate
for a full-time employee commencing on or after 1
August 2004 as prescribed by the minimum wage
order for the Construction Industry sector is $17.60.
Taking into consideration payments not typically
received by a contractor, the estimated minimum
remuneration of the ceiling plasterer in respect of
that contract, performing 90 days of service is
calculated to be:
$17.60 x 8 x 120% x 90 days = $15,206.40
In this instance, the labour-only component
($14,400) paid to the ceiling plasterer is less than
the estimated remuneration ($15,206.40)
calculated using the formula. Therefore, the 90-day
exemption applies to the contract.
In applying the Revised Alternative Method,
principals must identify the industry sector that best
matches the type of work undertaken by the
contractor. The minimum wage order to be used is
the order applicable at the commencement of the
contract and if the same contract continues into the
following financial year, the minimum wage order
to be used in that financial year must be the order
in force at the commencement of that financial
year. Records must be kept regarding the minimum
wage order used for each contractor for a period of
five years.
Where no comparable minimum wage order exists,
employers who can provide a satisfactory alternative
rate may seek a private ruling from the State
Revenue Office.
Please note that rulings do not have the force of
law. Each decision made by the State Revenue
Office is made on the merits of each individual case
having regard to any relevant ruling. All rulings
must be read subject to Revenue Ruling GEN.01.
