Meale v The King [2025] HCADisp 259 (6 November 2025)
[2025] HCADisp
applicant seeks special leave to appeal from the whole of the judgment of the
Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Queensland
(Mullins P,
Brown JA and Wilson J agreeing) which dismissed the applicant's appeal
against his conviction for murder following a
trial before Bradley J and a
jury in the Supreme Court of Queensland.
Court of Appeal considered and determined the applicant's grounds of appeal and
provided adequate reasons in doing so. The proposed
appeal is not a suitable
vehicle for examining the proper application of the principles stated in
Edwards v The Queen
[1993] HCA 63
(1993) 178 CLR 193.
leave to appeal is refused.
