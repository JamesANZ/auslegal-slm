Publication Restriction:
29 April 2013 the tribunal published its reserved decision in relation to an
amended complaint made by the Health Care Complaints
Commission against Dr
Annette Do. In publishing that reserved decision the tribunal did not redact or
anonymise the name of the relevant
patient the subject of the amended complaint,
Mr Daniel Siebler.
Mr O'Donnell of counsel (who appears on behalf of the Commission) has made an
oral application that the version of the reasons
for decision which has been
placed in the public arena through the Case Law website should anonymise Mr
Siebler's name.
support of that application, Mr O'Donnell has pointed to the provisions of the
National Law which he says gives the tribunal power
to make that order. I accept
the submission which he makes in that regard.
O'Donnell further submits that it is ordinarily the case in this tribunal that
that power is exercised in relation to, amongst
other things, the names of
patients, the subject of tribunal's investigations.
the present case, as Mr O'Donnell submits, there is a difference from what might
be regarded as the ordinary case in the tribunal
- that difference being that
the relevant patient is dead, and dead as a direct consequence of the matters
the subject of this tribunal's
O'Donnell submitted that there is no utility in the publication of Mr Siebler's
O'Donnell has further submitted that there would be some sensitivity in the
family of the deceased in his name being published
in the manner in which the
decision is presently to be found. That is not necessarily so. There is
certainly no evidence of any kind
that the family's wishes are to that effect;
and it is equally on the cards, in my view, that the family would wish to have
Mr Siebler's
name published in order that the wrong done to him might be
publicly acknowledged. I am not prepared to speculate one way or the
the absence of evidence as to the family's wishes; but I am not persuaded
positively that they do wish to have some form
of suppression order in place.
general terms, what the Commission seeks is for the balancing between the
competing considerations of open justice and individual
case to resolve itself in favour of individual privacy.
is an issue with which the justice system frequently struggles.
has assisted courts and tribunals in specific cases by legislating for effective
involving children in the criminal
restrictions.
Similarly, in cases of sexual assault involving adults there is
also a mandatory statutory provision. In other areas of the justice
system those
restrictions do not apply. In almost all criminal matters involving adults,
other than sexual assault, there is little,
if any, restriction on information
being publicly available. And in civil proceedings, which in many cases can be
just as sensitive
as criminal matters, there is a marked reluctance to restrict
the available information to the public.
more recent times, Parliament has turned its mind to this issue in the
Information Act
2010. It is, of course, immediately to be acknowledged that
that Act does not expressly apply to this tribunal. The definition section
the Act defines "courts" as being the Supreme Court, th District Court and the
Land and Environment Court. That being said, and
although I have not had
detailed or any submissions on this point, there is room for thinking that the
principles attending upon
Information Act
(which has not yet
come into force, although it has received the Royal Assent), would be something
that this tribunal would need
to consider in the exercise of its discretionary
facie, in my view the principles of open justice militate against the imposition
of restrictions on information or events occurring
in courts or tribunals
without there being an overwhelming competing consideration. In the present
case, I am not persuaded that
the discretion should be exercised to displace the
open operation of this tribunal and, in particular, where there is no clear
from the family as to its wishes. (I interpolate, however, that that
would not necessarily be a decisive factor. It would be a relevant
these reasons the application of the Commission to anonymise or otherwise redact
the name of Daniel Siebler from the decision
published in the open media through
Case Law is refused. I direct that a copy of these remarks be taken out and
placed on the Case
Law website.
