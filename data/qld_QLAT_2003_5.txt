DECISION APPEALED AGAINST
Grant for 6 month trial period of application for an extended hours permit
on a permanent basis.

Mrs G Spender(Chairperson)
Dr M O’Donnell
DECISION DATE
13 January 2003
BACKGROUND TO THIS APPEAL
1. On 30 January 2002, Clara Mechteld van den Hoven and Hans Remco Klipp
(“the applicants”), who are the licensees under
an on-premises
(meals) licence in respect of Après Beach Bar and Grill, situated at
119-121 Williams Esplanade, Palm Cove,
applied for an extended hours permit on a
regular basis to allow trading to 1am seven days a week. At that time the
approved trading
hours for the subject premises were 10am-12mn seven days a
week. The premises closed down in January 2002 for refurbishment. Trading
recommenced on 1 June 2002. On 7 June 2002, the relevant licence document was
amended as a result of an unrelated application lodged
by the applicants. The
description of the licensed area was changed and a number of noise conditions
were imposed on the licence.
The trading hours continued to be 10am to 12mn
seven days a week.
2. On 11 July 2002, the Chief Executive determined to approve the application
for an extended hours permit on a regular basis for
a 6 month trial period,
subject to the imposition of two new specific trading conditions relating to
noise which were imposed in
addition to the existing noise conditions endorsed
on the licence. The new noise conditions imposed were:
“1. Noise emanating from entertainment music or related activities in
the restaurant must not exceed 74dB(C), fast response,
when measured
approximately 3 metres from the source of the
2. Noise emanating from entertainment music or related activities in the bar
area must not exceed 90dB(C), fast response, when measured
approximately 3
metres from the source of the noise.”
3. The first and second appellants lodged the present appeals against this
decision of the Chief Executive. The first appellant is
the applicants’
landlord under a lease in respect of the subject premises. The appeals were
heard by video link between the
Cairns hearing room and the Brisbane hearing
room on the 10 October 2002. The appellants were represented at the hearing by
present in the Cairns hearing room, leave having been granted to all
parties for legal representation at a prior Directions Conference.
applicants and the Chief Executive were not legally represented. The applicants
were present in the Cairns hearing room and the
representative of the Chief
Executive was present with the Tribunal members in the Brisbane hearing
WITHDRAWAL OF APPLICATION
4. Before the Tribunal had handed down its decision in the appeal, the
applicants advised the Chief Executive by way of a letter
dated 21 November 2002
that they were “regretfully” withdrawing their application for
extended trading hours. The reasons
stated for this action were that they had
been served by the first appellant, apparently after the hearing of the appeal,
further notice of breach of their lease in which one of the alleged
breaches was stated to be that they had lodged and continued
application for an extended hours permit. The lease of the subject premises
expressly requires the landlord’s consent
for any application under the
, and the Tribunal had been advised by the applicants at the
hearing that they were in dispute with the first appellant over a number
issues, including whether or not the first appellant had previously represented
that it consented or would consent to extended
trading hours. The applicants
said in their letter of 21 November 2002 that, under duress, faced with the
possibility that the first
appellant may use the non-withdrawal of the
application as a breach of a condition under the lease, they were regretfully
withdrawing
that application. The applicants had considered that they may have
been able to obtain the first appellant’s consent to the
extension of
trading hours, however, that outcome did not now seem possible. The applicants
had stated at the hearing of the appeal
that if the Tribunal confirmed the
decision of the Chief Executive they hoped that the first appellant might
re-consider its position
because it might be exposed to further claims by the
applicants for interfering with the applicants’ use and enjoyment of the
5. The Division provided the letter of 21 November 2002 to the Tribunal on 25
November 2002. The Tribunal then wrote to all parties
seeking submissions as to
the legal effect of the proported withdrawal of the applicants’
application and as to Tribunal’s
statutory powers to discontinue or
otherwise deal with the appeals. All parties except the Division provided
submissions as requested.
Included in the submissions of each of the
appellants were applications for compensation under
s.38(2) for costs thrown away. The applicants in their submission advised that
they would consent to an order against them for costs
thrown away. Neither of
the appellants indicated that they were prepared to withdraw their appeals or
agree to the making of any
substantive orders by consent.
6. Having considered the submissions provided, the Tribunal is of the view that
the applicants are entitled to unilaterally withdraw
their application. We
accept the argument of the solicitor for the second appellant in this regard. In
the absence of a sufficient
manifestation of a legislative intention to the
contrary, a statutory power or entitlement to apply for a statutory licence is
exercisable
from time to time as occasion requires: see
Interpretation Act 1954
. We consider that this means that a person who has
invoked a statutory power to make application for a statutory right or benefit
is, in the absence of a sufficient manifestation of a legislative intention to
the contrary, also entitled to unilaterally withdraw
the application as made. We
agree with the submission made on behalf of the second appellant that there is
nothing within the terms
”) to expressly or implicitly displace the operation of this
generally applicable principle.
Section 105(4)
which provides
for a deemed withdrawal of an application by an applicant in specified
circumstances, provides, in the words of
the solicitor for the second
appellant, “tacit if not express support” for the operation of the
principle under the
7. The appeals however were properly instituted being based on a decision by the
Chief Executive which was itself based upon an application
properly before him.
The appeals thus remain on foot although, by reason of the supervening
withdrawal of the application, there
is no longer any substantive question
remaining alive for determination by the Tribunal. Moreover, pursuant to
, an appeal that has been properly started cannot be withdrawn or
abandoned without the Tribunal’s leave. In those circumstances
in order to
give effect to the withdrawal of the application, the proper course for the
Tribunal to take, in our view, is to make
an order setting aside the decision of
the Chief Executive to grant the application.
8. The Chief Executive has no power to review his decision to grant the
application once the appeal has been instituted: see the
Banyans Tavern decision
Denis Graham and anor –v- the Chief Executive & anor
Liquor Appeals Tribunal, appeal numbers 69 and 70 of 2001/2002, decision of 16
October 2002.)
9. The endorsement of new noise conditions on the licence by the Chief Executive
on 11 July 2002 was not done in response to the
application in question but
rather pursuant to the Chief Executive’s general discretion to impose
appropriate trading conditions
on a licence. The new noise conditions were to
apply to trading both before and after 12mn, and in those circumstances we
that the withdrawal of the application does not affect the validity of
those new noise conditions. We will thus set aside only the
component of the
decision of 11 July 2002 which deals with the extension of trading hours to
10. We consider that there is no power to grant costs in the present
circumstances under any of the heads specified in s.38(2). The
power to grant costs under section 38(2) is very limited. We do not consider
that the power given in s.38(2)(b)
to make an order for costs where a person
concerned in the appeal has not given reasonable prior notice of intention to
seek an adjournment
of a hearing can be extended by necessary implication to
the situation where an application is withdrawn as in the present circumstances.
But even if we be wrong in this, we would not be prepared in our discretion to
exercise any statutory power in the present circumstances
to award costs.
11. In our view the applicants have given an adequate explanation for their
late withdrawal of the application. Furthermore pursuant
to s.38(1) no costs
would have been awarded if the appellants had succeeded in obtaining an order,
following a consideration of the
merits of the appeals by the Tribunal, that the
decision of the Chief Executive be set aside. We do not think that it is either
or fair that the appellants should be placed in a better position
with respect to costs where they have obtained the same successful
their appeals as a result of the withdrawal of the application, rather than as a
result of a determination on the
