2024 QUEENSLAND CONFERENCE
SOCIAL JUSTICE: WE’RE IN THIS TOGETHER
By Sarah Grace
At the opening session of our 26th ALA Queensland State Conference, I asked
delegates to stand, and then asked them to be seated in
cohorts based on years
of attendance. First it was 1–2 years, then 3–5, 6–10,
10–15, 15–20 and finally
20+ years. This exercise demonstrated that
the strength and depth of commitment to the ALA in Queensland is significant. It
that everyone in the room was working towards a common cause. ALA
members are like-minded; we all work for everyday people to ensure
receive access to fair and adequate compensation when something goes wrong in
their lives. It was a powerful exercise and
I hope one that resonated with
members, deepening understanding of the purpose and drive of the ALA.
I also reflected upon commitment to social justice in the context of raising
children. My daughter Penny started at ‘Sherwood
Community Kindy’
this year. She came home at the start of the year and said to me that it is
actually called Yagara Kindergarten;
it took me awhile to work out that Penny
was using the name of the traditional owners of the land on which her
Kindergarten is built.
And she said to me:
‘We are here to play on this land just for a little bit, but it
isn’t ours, so we have to be careful with it and take
I thought it was such a beautiful way to look at the world. Through the eyes
of a four-year-old.
With so much change over the last few years, and the social challenges we are
facing not just here in Queensland or Australia, but
globally – I think it
is more important than ever to approach all aspects of our lives with the
mindset that ‘we are
all in this together’.
especially true of our pursuit for social justice. Social justice is a
commitment to equity, fairness and the recognition
of every individual’s
inherent worth. The ALA’s tireless efforts for social justice are more
than mere aspiration; the
efforts are to ensure it is a lived reality for all.
The 26th Conference was an opportunity, as it is every year, to reflect on this
and embrace the strength of the ALA’s unwavering commitment to social
THE KEYNOTE
We heard from Greg Barns SC on the Youth Justice Crisis in Queensland, which
is set to be an important issue in the 2024 Queensland
state election. In his
keynote – ‘Youth Justice in Queensland: Wrong Way, Turn Back’
– Greg spoke of opportunities
to work towards community-based solutions,
rather than continuing to incarcerate our youth. He spoke of the need for a new
and said that there are no simple answers, but there are answers. There
will never be a one-size-fits-all solution to curtailing
anti-social and
criminal activity in communities.
The ALA is one of many stakeholders who are calling for a
‘re-think’ in this space, not just in Queensland but nationally
I am hopeful that together our communities will identify and implement some
sustainable solutions to youth crime.
CIVIL JUSTICE AWARD
I had the great honour of announcing this years’ ALA Queensland Civil
Justice Award to Manuela Whitford.
When Manuela was working as a clinical nurse in the Queensland prison system
she saw the harm being caused by domestic violence, and
women who committed
crimes because being in prison was safer than being at home with an abusive
partner. Recognising that people
need more support to be able to safely escape
violence at home, Manuela stepped up and formed an organisation called Friends
The charity now operates nationally to support victim-survivors as they
rebuild their lives, free from abuse.
It was a pleasure not only to announce Manuela as the winner of the award but
to meet her and hear more about the work she is doing,
and her passion for
continuing to better the lives of individuals experiencing such hardship.
Ensuring social justice in Queensland and Australia is increasingly complex
but the ALA’s commitment is unwavering. Through
our advocacy we seek to
foster understanding by promoting dialogue with governments, both state and
federal, as well as our opponents,
and we advocate for change, when needed. That
is the heart of the ALA’s pursuit for social justice and we do this
It is the work of our members and committees, and the incredibly valuable
contributions of our speakers and sponsors, that ensures
the ALA can continue
this important mission.
An African proverb that resonates with me when thinking about the work of the
ALA is: ‘If you want to go fast, go alone. If
you want to go far, go
