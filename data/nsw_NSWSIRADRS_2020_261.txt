Merit Reviewer, Dispute Resolution Service
Merit Reviewer’s Reasons for Determination
is a Merit Review by the Claimant, ARI of an internal review conducted by the
Insurer, NRMA Insurance Ltd dated 12 June 2020.
The Merit Review dispute
concerns the amount of weekly benefits payable under division 3.2 schedule 2,
clause 1(a) pursuant to the
Motor Accident Injuries Act 2017
and whether the
Claimant has capacity to return to preinjury duties.
Claimant was born in South Korea. After completing secondary schooling, he
relocated to China before returning to Korea to complete
two years mandatory
military service.
2009 ARI relocated to Australia and initially worked in a restaurant before
working as a gyprock plasterer with contractors in
Sydney as well as locations
throughout New South Wales.
into Australia was via a student visa. A condition of this visa was that
ARI’s hours to work on average were limited
to 20 hours per week.
Claimant describes the duties of a gyprocker in his statement dated 1 October
2020 at paragraph 9(a) to (l), which can be summarised
as physically demanding.
26 June 2018 ARI was a passenger in a vehicle involved in a serious motor
vehicle accident (“the accident”). He was
trapped in the vehicle
and required extrication by ambulance officers. He was conveyed to hospital for
treatment for serious spinal
and left wrist injuries.
sets out details of his injuries and disabilities in paragraphs 10 and 11 of his
the Claimant and Insurer submit ARI’s PAWE is either $1,124.66 or
$1,121.58, the Merit Review dispute is the Claimant’s
capacity to work
post-accident. The Claimant relies on the Work Capacity Certificate’s
issued by ARI’s general practitioner
and medical report by Dr Hajeong Lee
and Consultant Physician, Dr Steven Buckley’s conclusions, and Consultant
Psychiatrist,
Mr Jonathon Phillips and Rehabilitation Consultant, Mr Ross
Insurer relies on their rehabilitation expert from Prudence Rehabilitation and
the medical opinion by Physician, Dr Ron Muratore.
Documents and Information
10. I have considered the documents provided in the
application and the reply and any further information provided by the parties.
Submissions
Claimant’s Submissions
Claimant ‘s submissions can be summarised as follows:-
11.1 Based on
the Claimant’s evidence ARI does not have capacity to work 40 hours per
week as a product assembler and therefore
the Insurer’s calculation of the
Claimant’s weekly payments of $109.79 per week from 11 June 2020 is
evidence to support this submission is Dr Buckley noting ARI is unable to return
to work in any capacity or employment involving
heavy manual work.
Claimant’s general practitioner, Dr Lee has certified ARI fit for some
week with physical restrictions.
guidelines stipulate when assessing the Claimant’s post-accident earning
capacity after 78 weeks, the nature and extent
of injuries and details given in
the Claimant’s Certificate of Fitness should be considered which is
consistent with the opinion
of Dr Buckley.
conclusion in the vocational report of Dr Girdler after acknowledging the
Claimant’s limitations to speak and understand
English, his previous
experience primarily working in heavy labouring positions, his ability to work
full time is doubtful.
response, the Claimant submits his entitlements to statutory benefits is $897.26
from 11 June 2020 and continuing.
Insurer’s Submission
Insurer’s submissions can be summarised as follows: - 13.1 The Internal
Review Certificate should be upheld.
13.2 Dr Muratore
considered the Claimant fit for light work on a full-time basis 6 weeks
post-accident. The doctor’s comment
the Claimant “...well formed
calluses in the palms of both hands ...” is suggestive ARI is undertaking
physical work.
13.3 The Labour
Market Analysis Report by Ms Rhonda Nohra considered ARI has a work capacity to
find employment as a product assembler
earning $963.00 per week which equates to
a loss of $109.79 per week.
Legislation
14. In conducting my review, I have considered the
following legislation and guidelines:
Accident Injuries Act
(NSW) (“the Act”)
Accident Guidelines
effective 13 July 2018 (“the Guidelines”)
Accident Injuries Regulation
(NSW) (“the Regulation”)
the Merit Review was lodged by the Claimant and both parties made submissions,
ARI has gained employment as a part time cleaner
at XYZ Golf Club. He works 20
hours per week and his hourly rate is $19.00 per hour.
this updated evidence, both parties’ calculations are out of date.
Nevertheless,
I disagree with the Insurer’s submissions in general, for the following
Muratore opined the accident affected his earning capacity for 6 weeks,
thereafter he was fit for light duties work, full time.
Based on his first
assessment of ARI’s physical capabilities, the doctor was able to confirm
that in his opinion ARI could
work as a product assembler full time.
conclusion ignores the treating general practitioner’s Fitness for Work
Certificate as at 23 May 2020 which states ARI
is capable to work 5 hours per
day, 3 days per week providing suitable duties are available. Dr Lee has
treated the Claimant since
his accident. He is in the best position to assess
ARI’s fitness for work, unlike Dr Muratore engaged to assess the Claimant
once for the purpose of a medico legal opinion. As such I prefer Dr Lee’s
assessment.
Furthermore,
I acknowledge the expertise of the consultants from Prudence Rehabilitation and
note, Ms Nohra’s recommendations
for labour market contacts included
capacity to work in confirmed roles at 15 hours per week which further supports
his employment
response to further particulars requested by me, Dr Buckley reviewed Job Outlook
description of a product assembler and the tasks
this role demands. The
physician’s assessment of ARI’s role as a product assembler is
“...there are a wide range
of skills, abilities and activities required of
a product assembler which are impaired for ARI to such an extent that the
employer would have difficulty in tolerating his level of
impairment”. The doctor rendered ARI not physically fit to engage
as a product assembler.
on the limited amount of hours Prudence Consulting found the Claimant could
work, and the opinions of Dr Lee and Dr Buckley,
the Reviewable Decision is set
aside and the following decision is made in substitution of the Reviewable
Claimant’s PAWE is $1,121.58 and at the time the Merit Review was lodged
his employment opportunities were limited. Therefore,
pursuant to
of the Act the Claimant’s entitlement to weekly payment of
statutory benefits from 11 June 2020 is calculated as $897.26, 80%
of his PAWE.
This amount will need to be adjusted by the parties in light of the
Claimant’s recent part time employment.
Legal Costs
24. The Claimant was legally represented. However,
no claim has been made for legal costs and as such the amount allowed is Nil.
Determination
My determination of the Merit Review is as follows:
reviewable decision is set aside
and the following decision is made in
substitution for the reviewable decision:
Claimant’s entitlements to weekly payments of statutory benefits is
This determination takes effect on 11 June 2020
