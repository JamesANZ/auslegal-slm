CASES REFERRED TO
THE DECISION
Not applicable
REASONS FOR DECISION
1. BACKGROUND
This matter originally came on for hearing on 14
February 2011 when a decision was handed down finding the Respondent (Builder)
responsible
for faulty work in the bathrooms. Reasons for the decision were
published on 23 March 2011 and for the background position these
Reasons are
referred to. The position now is that the parties were unable to agree to the
Builder doing repairs and accordingly on
10 August 2011 an application was heard
by the Owner for a cash payment by the Builder to enable the Owner to effect the
repairs herself.
2. EVIDENCE
2.1 The Builder through his legal advisers had submitted
an assessment of the likely costs by a quantity surveyor, Mr Gavin Brackenreg.
He had included two options in his paper at pages 199-204 of our papers. The
first assumed that only selective replacement of tiling
might be needed and the
second that all tiling would need replacement. This latter figure came to
$21,995 which excluded builder’s
administration and builder’s profit
but included GST on the costs.
2.2 The Owner had obtained a quotation from Mr Charles Malet of Artemis Building
Group and had called Mr Malet as a witness. This
quotation for both bathrooms
$12,332.60 and $13,637.50 or a total of $25,970 plus GST
$2,597 = $28,567. However this did not include the cost of matching the existing
tiles, or where such were not available, the added cost of new tiles.
2.3 Two other quotes were also included. One from Minchin and Sons totalled
$35,582. The other from Seaview Builders totalled $39,307.
One further item for
repair ordered by the Tribunal was for a crack in the main bedroom and dressing
room. The only quote for this
came to $675 plus $67 GST or $742, and was
submitted by Artemis Building Group. No exception was taken to this cost by the
2.4 In evidence Mr Malet stated that all the floor had to be removed in the
westerly bathroom and the tiles on the east and north
walls of the eastern
bathroom. He noted that on the eastern wall they had stuck some kind of sheeting
to the wall and the Hardiflex
has come away. In the westerly bathroom they would
have to replace the shower screen. To match sizes was impossible. The crack in
the bedroom wall was full length and required repainting the wall. In
cross-examination he stated he was familiar with the Building
Inspector’s
2.5 The Builder did not call Mr Brackenreg and instead Counsel attempted to
question the costs and reduce the assessment of Mr Brackenreg.
The Tribunal did
not accept this reassessment, especially as Mr Brackenreg was a qualified
quantity surveyor. However in his report
at page 200 Mr Brackenreg advised that
the assessment was based on the findings of the Building Inspector and that no
other documentation
was provided. He had not visited the site. Accordingly Mr
Malet’s assessment was much more convincing by reason of his
knowledge of the situation.
3. ASSESSMENT OF COSTS
3.1 If is of note that the assessment of the costs of Mr
Malet and of Mr Brackenreg are fairly similar although Mr Brackenreg had
several items from his assessment. These were:
screen. There is an item under ‘Glazing’ to reinstall the existing
screen but it is very doubtful that in what
is described as
“gutting” the bathroom that the original screen would have survived.
The cost of fitting a new screen
is $800 less
allowance of $180 in the quote $620
cornice – no mention of this item.
Add original quote
To the above figure must be added an assessment for
builder’s administration/supervision and builder’s profit. These
can vary considerably from 15% to 25%. A reasonable addition can be
considered of 20% of the figure of $20,815.
This figure of $27,475 can be compared to the Artemis
quote of $28,567. Bearing in mind that Mr Brackenreg had not been to the site,
the quote of Artemis Building Group which had been made from personal assessment
can properly be accepted as a reasonable quotation.
3.2 In addition it can be noted that the quotation of Mr Brackenreg was not
explained in evidence. There were two items “gut
ensuite” and
“gut bathroom”. Just exactly what was meant and in particular
whether that was a proper assessment
for the care required in removing and
replacing the bath and other items was not explained. We note however there was
an item for
removing and replacing the bath but it was felt to be somewhat low
in the circumstances. There was however a major problem with tiles.
There was no
direct reference in any quote as to whether these were to include replacement of
broken tiles in the course of removal
or whether the whole bathroom would
require new tiles. One bathroom in Mr Brackenreg’s assessment was to be
only partially
replaced with tiles. The other was for a total replacement. No
attempt had been made to assess whether replacement tiles to match
obtained. After some two and a half years since the tiling was done, it is
usually only possible to pick up the identical
tiles for a very heavy premium.
It is also very difficult to match existing tiles in colour let along design.
The Owner was therefore
asked to assess the position and inform the Tribunal and
the other party of the additional cost if any of replacement costs or purchase
of new tiles.
The Owner through Artemis has submitted a further quote. Of the items in this
quote, two related to tiles. These were:
Cost of new tiles
Increased cost to floor tiles
The balance of $253 in the
in relation to items apparently omitted from the
original cost, was not accepted by the Tribunal, as that aspect of the
hearing had been
concluded. No comment has been received from the Builder.
3.2 Taking all these matters into account the total cost which we allow is as
of repairs to two bathrooms as per Artemis quotation (inc GST) $28,567
for additional costs of tiling as per quote of 12 August
($2,256 + 15% cited in quote, i.e. $338 = $2,594
+ GST of $259)
for repair of crack at doorway of main bedroom
GST of $67)
There will be Orders as follows:
“The Builder is to pay the Owner the sum of $32,162 within 21 days of
the date of this Order.”
