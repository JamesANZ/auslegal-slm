HAZEL HONEY F LIM FOR LEAVE TO
ISSUE OR FILE
[2025] HCASJ 39

A21 of 2025

application for a constitutional or other writ is
the Principal Registrar of the High Court of Australia to provide a copy of
these reasons for judgment to the Chief Executive
Officer of the Federal Circuit
and Family Court of Australia (Division 2).
Representation
The applicant is unrepresented
On 4 September 2025, Gordon J made a direction under r 6.07.2 of
High Court Rules 2004
(Cth) that the Registrar refuse to issue or
file an application by the applicant for a constitutional or other writ without
of a Justice first had and obtained. By ex parte application filed on
11 September under r 6.07.3 of the
High Court Rules
applicant seeks such leave. The application is supported by an affidavit sworn
by the applicant on 8 September 2025.
the following reasons, leave to issue or file the proposed application for a
constitutional or other writ should be refused.
criteria governing the exercise of the discretion to refuse leave to issue or
file a document under r 6.07.3 of the
High Court Rules
are the same
as those which inform the decision of the Registrar to seek direction from a
Justice under r 6.07.1. That is, leave
to issue or file the document will
ordinarily be refused where it "appears ... 'on its face' to be an abuse of the
process of the
Court, to be frivolous or vexatious or to fall outside the
Consideration
the application for a constitutional or other writ dated 2 September 2025,
the applicant seeks constitutional writs and other
relief against the Federal
Court of Australia, Judge Heffernan (a former judge of the Federal Circuit Court
of Australia) and Charlesworth
J (a justice of the Federal Court of
Australia).
genesis of the application lies in the proceedings the applicant brought against
her former employer for alleged contraventions
Fair Work Act
(Cth). On 31 March 2021, Judge Heffernan dismissed those
proceedings.
27 October 2022, Charlesworth J dismissed the applicant's application
for an extension of time to appeal from those
2023, Charlesworth J ordered that the applicant pay the respondents' costs
incurred from 19 October
As the parties could
not agree on the quantum payable as the respondents' costs, on 30 October
2024, a Registrar of the Federal Court
made an order fixing the respondents'
By interlocutory
application the applicant sought a review of the Registrar's decision. On
17 March 2025, Charlesworth J set aside
the order of the Registrar and
fixed the respondents' costs in a lesser
the current application, the applicant contends that the order of Judge
Heffernan dismissing her proceedings and the orders of
Charlesworth J
dismissing her application for an extension of time to appeal and for costs
should be set aside as they involved,
by reason of the conduct of the Judge or
Justice (as relevant) and Registry officers of the Courts, one or all of
breaches of "constitutional
duties of impartiality, independence and
institutional integrity", other errors, "systemic bias", denials of procedural
failures to provide adequate reasons, and failures to consider
relevant matters.
the material filed in support of the application is a contention that Judge
Heffernan delivered judgment in
Lim v Flinders University of South Australia
after he had
ceased to be a judge of the Federal Circuit Court. The evidence in support of
this contention is the recorded date of
the judgment (31 March 2021), the
date appearing on Judge Heffernan's orders dismissing the application (31 March
2021), and an extract
from the website of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia
which records the following:
"Timothy Heffernan
Appointment date: 23 November, 2015
Retirement date: 01 April, 2020"
a former judge of a Ch III court purported to make an order or publish
reasons for judgment after they ceased to be a judge of
the Ch III court
(by either attaining the maximum age of 70 years or by resigning their office by
writing under their hand delivered
to the Governor-General), the order and the
reasons would be void ab
public records "the authority of which cannot reasonably be
questioned",
indicate that Judge Heffernan's retirement date was later than 1 April 2020, so
that the extract from the website of the
Federal Circuit Court may be inferred
to be wrong. For example, reasons for judgment published by Judge Heffernan on
record that the hearing before the judge occurred on 13 August
reasons for
judgment published by Judge Heffernan on 23 March 2021 record that the hearing
before the Judge occurred on 11 and 23
and reasons for
judgment published by Judge Heffernan on 25 March 2021 record that the
hearing before the judge occurred on
addition, it is not apparent why the applicant would not have raised this issue
at an earlier time if it were true. The applicant
applied for an extension of
time for leave to appeal from Judge Heffernan's orders of 31 March 2021, but it
is not apparent from
the reasons of Charlesworth J that this application
included any suggestion that Judge Heffernan was not a judge of the Federal
Court at the time he made the orders sought to be
Charlesworth J dismissed this application on 27 October 2022 and the
applicant did not attempt to file the current application
in this Court until 2
September 2025 the inference is that the applicant added this additional ground
in reliance solely on the website
extract from the Federal Circuit Court. If
that is so, it is not apparent why the applicant did not seek to quash the
orders of Judge
Heffernan within the period of 6 months after the date of his
orders, as required by r 25.02.2(a) of the
High Court Rules
none of the material filed in support of the application reveals an intelligible
basis for the relief sought. Accordingly,
the proposed application is
"manifestly untenable" and, having regard to the unexplained lapse of time from
the date of refusal by
Charlesworth J of the application for an extension
of time for leave to appeal, the proposed application also would be an "abuse
process" if filed.
these circumstances, if there was no evidence "the authority of which cannot
reasonably be questioned" indicating that Judge Heffernan
was a judge of the
Federal Circuit Court after the date of 1 April 2020 contrary to the statement
on the website of that Court, I
would have granted leave to the applicant to
file the current application, that application being confined to the ground that
Heffernan made the impugned order after he ceased to be a Judge of the
Federal Circuit Court. As there is such evidence "the authority
of which cannot
reasonably be questioned", it would be inappropriate to grant such leave even on
that confined basis. Rather, the
application for leave to file should be
dismissed on the basis that, if the applicant can adduce further
incontrovertible evidence
proving that Judge Heffernan was not a Judge of the
Federal Circuit Court when he made the orders on 31 March 2021, that evidence
would be a material change of circumstances permitting the applicant to again
file the application for leave without that being an
obvious abuse of process of
this Court despite the long delay in the applicant bringing this matter to this
Court. Undoubtedly, the
Federal Circuit Court itself is best placed to confirm,
one way or another, Judge Heffernan's status on 31 March 2021.
these reasons, the following orders are made:
1. The ex parte
application filed on 11 September 2025 for leave to issue or file an application
for a constitutional or other writ
is dismissed.
2. Direct the Principal Registrar of the High Court of Australia to provide
a copy of these reasons for judgment to the Chief Executive
Officer of the
Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2).
