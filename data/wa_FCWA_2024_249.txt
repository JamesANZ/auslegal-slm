Court was asked to conduct a review of a registrar's decision pursuant to
rule 490(3)
Family Court Rules 2021
applicant mother, [Ms Lester] ("the Applicant"), in her Form 2
Application for Review filed 23 October 2024 ("the Review")
the Court consider the registrar's decision to refuse to accept a
Form 2 Application filed 15 October 2024 ("the Proposed
Application").
She also requested the Court provide reasons for decision.
proceedings relate to the parties' daughter, [Child A] born [in] 2020. The other
party to the proceedings is the respondent father,
[Mr Beattie]
("the Respondent").
the Reasons that follow, I allowed the Review and directed the Proposed
Application be accepted for filing as at the date it
was lodged on the eCourts
20 December 2019, the parties agreed final orders by consent, which
provided for, amongst other things, Child A to live between
the parties in an
equal time arrangement.
1 November 2023, the Applicant recommenced proceedings, which the
Respondent responded to on 4 December 2023. For present purposes,
is only necessary to note that both parties currently seek orders on a final
basis for Child A to live with them.
March 2024, the parties attended a case assessment conference with [a
Family Consultant], whereby they agreed a minute of interim
consent orders.
The sole focus of the interim orders was to address the Applicant's concern
in the care of the Respondent, which was
shared by the Family Consultant.
interim orders included a finalisation order, which reflected that if neither
party sought to relist the proceedings by 1 December
2024, the matter
would be finalised as follows:
(a) the 2019 final orders by consent would remain in full force and effect;
(b) in terms of paragraphs 1 to 3 of the minute of interim consent orders.
his memorandum, the Family Consultant described Child A's absenteeism as
unacceptable and without justifiable reason. Further,
he raised concern, with "a
focus on the father", about parenting communication noting the turmoil Child A
has endured since the age
of 8 years due to "parental toxicity". He
reflected that judicial oversight may be required.
15 October 2024, the Applicant filed the Proposed Application seeking,
amongst other orders, for Child A to live with her. In
her affidavit filed in
support, she deposes to Child A's ongoing school absenteeism in the Respondent's
care, which if correct, averages
at approximately 45 per cent,
compared to 88 per cent when in the care of the Applicant.
17 October 2024, the Court rejected the Proposed Application for
filing for the following reasons ("the Rejection Letter"):
existing arrangements for the child have been in place for a significant period
primary issue relates to the child's school attendance.
the Applicant's own evidence, the child has a "close relationship" with both
parties and she has "no other significant concerns
is in [the other party's] care".
The parties are encouraged to consider participating in Family Dispute
Resolution with a focus on the recommendations contained
in the Case Assessment
Conference Report dated 28 March 2024. If after exploring this option, the
parties are unable to resolve the
matter, consideration may be given to a
judicial determination."
Legal principles
Applicant applies under r 490(3) of the Rules for a review of the Rejection
Letter. The Court is to conduct an original or de
novo hearing and may
receive as evidence any affidavit tendered in the first hearing, and any further
affidavit or exhibit.
is in the following terms:
490. Rejection of documents
(1) A registrar or judicial officer may reject a document filed or received for
filing if the document —
(a) is not in the proper form in accordance with these rules; or
(b) is not executed in the way required by these rules; or
(c) does not otherwise comply with a requirement of these rules; or
(d) is tendered for filing after the time specified in these rules or an order
for filing the document; or
(e) on its face, appears to the judicial officer to be an abuse of process,
frivolous, scandalous or vexatious; or
(f) is tendered for filing in connection with a current case in a registry that
is not the filing registry.
(2) If a judicial officer rejects a document filed or received for filing under
subrule (1), the judicial officer may give directions
taken on the document, including a direction about costs.
(3) A person may apply for review of a registrar's decision under subrule (1)
or directions given by a judicial officer under subrule
(2) by filing an
application in a case without notice.
grounds for rejecting a document are an exhaustive list. There is nothing in
r 490(1) which suggests any other discretionary
grounds to refuse a
document for filing.
aside the fact that pursuant to the finalisation order, one or both parties had
the right to request a relisting, without
any obligation that such request be
accompanied by an application and affidavit, the Court's power to reject a
document is confined
to that set out in r 490(1).
the absence of applications being assessed as an abuse of process, frivolous,
scandalous or vexatious, which cannot be said of
the Proposed Application,
or where some other constraint has been placed upon a party, litigants are
entitled to file applications
with an expectation they will be listed and
determined in accordance with the Court's ordinary listing practices.
applying the
, including deciding whether to accept a document for filing,
the Court must take into consideration the nature of the proceedings
These proceedings are child-related and Child A's best interests are
legislatively mandated to be
Child A's best
interests cannot be secondary to case management
considerations.
is important to record that while the existing arrangements had been in place
for a significant period of time and that Child
A appears to have a close
relationship with the Respondent, those facts are by no means determinative of
the arrangements being in
Child A's best interests, nor that the Proposed
Application appears to be "an abuse of process, frivolous, scandalous or
vexatious".
registrar correctly recorded in the Rejection Letter that the primary dispute is
this context and having regard to the evidence in support of the Proposed
Application about this specific issue, it may matter
not that the Applicant
otherwise appeared to have no other "significant concerns" about Child A in the
Respondent's care. The central
issue in dispute is the Respondent's capacity to
ensure Child A's attendance at school and his compliance with the interim orders
which were entered to ameliorate this specific risk issue.
otherwise note the registrar referred the parties to family dispute resolution,
which they are not required to participate in when
litigation is on foot. To the
extent the Family Consultant made reference to mediation, I do not consider
he intended this recommendation
to extend to a situation where issues were again
being raised about Child A's school attendance, noting his strong comments
this issue.
registrar's decision was tantamount to a summary dismissal without affording the
Applicant a right to be heard. If the registrar
considered it fell within
r 490(1)(e), she was required to take the Applicant's material at its
highest. Had she done so, it is difficult
to understand how she reached the
conclusion she did, noting Child A appears to be at extreme educational
risk in the Respondent's
care on the Applicant's evidence.
this should not be taken to reflect a view about the ultimate outcome of the
Proposed Application, which will be determined
at a hearing.
is the Court's view that where interim applications are properly brought and do
not fall within the terms of r 490(1), they must
be accepted for filing by
Court so they can be listed, heard and determined on the merits. If the issues
disclosed in a filed application
are amenable to summary dismissal, the accepted
application can be referred to a judge or magistrate in
If the judge or
magistrate are so satisfied, it is open to those judicial officers to enter a
summary dismissal, noting the high
bar to be met before such a step is taken,
and are obliged to provide reasons.
all of the Reasons above, I upheld the review and accepted the Proposed
Application for filing.
directed the Principal Registrar to allocate a directions hearing
within 14 days as the issue relates to Child A's education; steps
should be taken by the Court to list the proceedings as soon as
practicable.
I certify that
the preceding paragraph(s) comprise the reasons for decision of the Family Court
of Western Australia.

I note that
registrars are not delegated the power to summarily dismiss applications. Family
law magistrates may accept a document
in their capacity as a registrar of this
Court, transfer the proceedings to the Magistrates Court, then determine the
application
as a magistrate in chambers.
