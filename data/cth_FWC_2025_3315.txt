FAIR WORK COMMISSION
Fair Work Act 2009
- Application for an order to stop bullying
(AB2025/771)
COMMISSIONER MCKINNON
SYDNEY, 13 NOVEMBER 2025
Application for an order to stop bullying at work – whether
application has reasonable prospects of success
14 September 2025, Ms Joanne Frendo applied for an order to stop bullying at
work under s.789FC of the
Fair Work Act 2009
(the Act). The application
was made in relation to Marvila Group Trading As West Coast Residential (West
Coast Residential) and a
person with whom Ms Frendo interacted while at work in
the business of West Coast Residential.
September 2025, the employment of Ms Frendo was terminated. It is not in dispute
that Ms Frendo is no longer at work in the
business of West Coast Residential
and that she is no longer interacting with the individual named in the
application in any work
context. The Commission could not make any orders in the
matter. Accordingly, Ms Frendo’s application for orders to stop bullying
at work has no reasonable prospects of
application (AB2025/771) is dismissed under section 587(1)(c) of the Act.
