maintained by this Court pursuant to
Legal Profession Act 2006
(ACT), and indicated that our reasons would be delivered at a later date. These

3. Between November 2009 and June 2014, the defendant was the
principal solicitor of the law practice Mark Slater Family Law. The
law practice
held a trust account holding monies on behalf of clients. The defendant was the
authorised person to sign cheques and
withdraw monies from the trust account.
4. In April 2014, the defendant made a voluntary disclosure to the Law
Society of the ACT regarding improper use of trust funds. On

defendant’s firm’s trust account
pursuant to
Profession Act
. Based upon a report prepared by Mr Bray dated 20 June 2014 (the
Bray Report), the Law Society commenced proceedings in the ACAT

5. The defendant did not contest the proceedings in the ACAT
and, on 5 February 2015, the ACAT made orders, by consent, declaring
defendant was guilty of professional misconduct in relation to each of the
grounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the application dated
24 July 2014 and requiring the
defendant to pay the Law Society’s costs of the application. The ACAT
further recommended that
the defendant’s name be removed from the local
roll of legal practitioners.
The present proceedings
Section 431
Legal Profession Act
provides that,
if the ACAT makes an order recommending that the name of an Australian legal
practitioner who is a local lawyer be
removed from the local roll, a copy of the
order may be filed in this Court, and this Court may order the removal of the
the roll. As we have already noted, the originating application
seeking orders that the defendant’s name be removed from the
local roll is
based upon the order of the ACAT recommending that his name be removed from the
roll. The defendant consented to this
order being made, and we made the order on
3 August this year.
7. We have prepared formal reasons for making the order
consistent with the approach taken by this Court in Law Society of the
Capital Territory v Burns
[2012] ACTSC 91
, where the need to provide
reasons, even in cases where removal of the name of the practitioner is by
consent, was discussed at [6]
the reasons for a person’s removal from the roll may be relevant in any
subsequent application for re-admission as a
practitioner. In
Association v Cummins
[2001] NSWCA 284
(2001) 52 NSWLR 279
, the New South Wales Court of
Appeal (Spigelman CJ with whom Mason P and Handley JA agreed) held that even
where the order removing
a name from the Roll of Legal Practitioners is not
opposed by the practitioner, the Court should record its findings, saying (at
285; [24]-[25]):
24 In such a case as the present, where there is no substantive contest as to
the ultimate operative order which the Court should
make, it is of particular
significance that the Court should record its findings. As Kirby P said in
The Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales v Ritchard
(Court of Appeal, 31 July 1987, unreported) at 4:
For the ordinary case, the Court has adopted the principle that, normally, it
will state its findings on the totality of the matters
put forward as
constituting professional misconduct, so that these will be available to be
dealt with, should they ever become relevant
to any future application by the
former solicitor for readmission to practise.
His Honour referred to
Law Society of New South Wales v Seymour
of Appeal, 14 April 1982, unreported) and
Bridges v Law Society of New
South Wales
[1983] 2 NSWLR 361
25 Kirby P went on to say in
Prothonotary v Ritchard
... Although the opinion must be reached that the offences warrant at the time
of order permanent removal, the removal of a solicitor
from the Roll is not
necessarily intended to be permanent in fact. See
Ex parte Evatt
New South Wales Bar Association
(1971) 71 SR (NSW) 153
at 157 ... People can
redeem themselves and demonstrate it by later conduct as a number of cases in
this State, both of solicitors
and barristers, show. Because that opinion may
give encouragement, in due course of time, to an application to be readmitted,
is all the more important that the unfortunate saga of the opponent’s
misdeeds should be collected and found by the Court.
Regulation of the legal profession generally
Secondly, the reasons given by a Full Court for ordering a person’s name
to be removed from the roll may be useful in the regulation
of the profession,
both directly, as a warning to other practitioners, and also by providing
guidance to both the relevant professional
body (in this case the Law Society)
and to the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal (
), which plays a
significant part in the regulation of the legal profession in the ACT including
through its role in the processes
for dealing with complaints about legal
practitioners.
(emphasis as per original)
8. Being satisfied that the defendant was guilty of
professional misconduct as set out in the Law Society’s application in the
ACAT dated 24 July 2014, we made the order removing his name from the roll of
practitioners.
I certify that the
preceding eight [8] numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for
Judgment of their Honours Justice Penfold,
Justice Burns and Justice North.
