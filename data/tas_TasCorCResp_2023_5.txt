Response received from Consumer Building and Occupational Services  1 December 2023
As an industry regulator, one of the roles of Consumer, Building and Occupational Services (CBOS) is managing the occupational licensing
of tradespeople and pursuing complaints relating to unlicensed or defective building work in accordance with the
Occupational Licensing Act 2005
. If a complaint is substantiated, CBOS can take various compliance actions, including suspending or cancelling licences, and prosecuting
Additionally, CBOS has a role to play in managing risks posed to consumers by dangerous goods, by ensuring goods meet safety standards
in accordance with the
Australian Consumer Law (Tasmania) Act 2010
. CBOS has authority under this Act to take enforcement actions as a result of breaches of consumer safety standards. Accordingly,
wholesalers and retailers of chainsaws must ensure imported tools are safe, meet Australian Standards and are fit for purpose. Traders,
importers and manufacturers are also obliged to promote products in ways that meet mandatory standards intended to prevent or reduce
the risk of injury. CBOS undertakes investigations and audits to ensure consumer goods comply with the relevant standard.
As a result of Coroner Simon Cooper’s investigation and recommendations following the death of Lawrence Phillips, and at the request
of the former Minister for Workplace Safety and Consumer Affairs, CBOS has engaged with jurisdictions around Australia to determine
the status of legislation relating to chainsaw licencing and use. As part of this inquiry, CBOS also sought the provision of data
relating to incidents of serious injury or death arising as a result of chainsaw use.
CBOS notes that other jurisdictions have accreditation or training requirements in place for those employed in forestry or related
industries, as is the case in Tasmania. For example, Tasmania has adopted the Forest Safety Code of Practice (Tasmania). Training
courses and accreditations are also available to consumers or traders through various educational institutions.
However, no other jurisdiction requires training or licensing for the private use of chainsaws, or accreditation for chainsaw vendors
and retailers. Additionally, no other state or territory has indicated that they intend to regulate chainsaw use more broadly or
The authority to take compliance action and to regulate certain industries or practices is conferred on CBOS through relevant legislation.
Under the current regulatory frameworks administered by CBOS, there are no licensing or accreditation requirements for private chainsaw
use or retail sales. CBOS does oversee the licensing of occupational trades under the
Occupational Licensing Act 2005
, but not the use of products. CBOS is therefore unable to develop requirements or enforce compliance in response to concerns or recommendations
regarding improper use of chainsaws by domestic consumers. Instead, CBOS ensures the products used are safe to operate, meet Australian
Standards and are provided with consumer guarantees.
It should be noted that WorkSafe Tasmania also provides information on their website relating to chainsaw safety operating procedures
and these documents are readily available to the public.
