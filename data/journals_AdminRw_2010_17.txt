The Human Rights Consultation
The Human Rights Consultation
On 21 April 2010 the Attorney-General, the Hon. Robert McClelland MP,
launched the Australian Government’s new Human Rights
Framework, which
outlines action the Government will take to promote and protect human rights.
The framework is available online
www.ag.gov.au/humanrightsframework
The Framework reaffirms the Government’s commitment to human rights and
community engagement. It draws on the valuable work
undertaken by the National
Human Rights Consultation in canvassing the views of the Australian community.
Guided by the report of
the National Human Rights Consultation, the Government
has set education about human rights and responsibilities as the highest
within the framework. The framework also includes measures to enhance
parliamentary scrutiny, including a new Parliamentary Joint
Committee on Human
Rights and a requirement that statements assessing compatibility of new laws
with our international human rights
obligations accompany new legislation. In
addition, the Attorney‑General announced the inclusion of the President of
the Australian
Human Rights Commission as an ex officio member of the
Administrative Review Council. The addition of the President of the AHRC will
promote the significance of human rights in the administrative law system.
