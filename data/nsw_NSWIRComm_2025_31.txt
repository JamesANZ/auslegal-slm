”) determined to make an interim award that provides a
temporary attraction and retention allowance of 10% calculated on base
the Special Allowance, and the Level 1 Private Practice Allowance to be paid to
all psychiatry staff specialists for a period
of 12 months (the temporary
allowance).
Full Bench observed that this allowance will supplement an existing 10%
allowance which, by operation of a determination made
Services Act
, the Health Secretary is paying to all psychiatry
staff specialists with the aim of retaining those staff specialists in their
employment (the Health Secretary’s retention allowance):

observed that, in combination with the Health Secretary’s retention
allowance, the temporary allowance
would effectively result in a combined
interim uplift on the base salary of psychiatry staff specialists of 20% for a
period of 12
Psychiatry Staff Specialists (No 2)
give effect to this decision, the Full Bench directed the parties to have
discussions for the purpose of providing the Commission
with an agreed version
of the new interim award reflecting the decision or, in absence of agreement, to
file a document setting out
their competing draft award clauses.
17 October 2025, the parties provided the Vice President’s chambers with
two versions of the proposed interim award which
highlighted the clauses that
are not agreed as between the parties.
principal difference between the parties concerns the clause for the payment of
the allowance. In the version provided by the
Australian Salaried Medical
Officers’ Federation (New South Wales) (ASMOF) the proposed award mandates
the payment of both
the temporary allowance and the Health Secretary’s
retention allowance. This version also contains a table which identifies
monetary rates for each of these allowances and a clause setting out a rationale
for the payment of the allowances covering some
of the issues relating to the
shortage of psychiatry staff specialists in New South Wales which the Full Bench
addressed in its decision.
contrast, the Health Secretary’s version provides for the payment of the
temporary allowance without addressing the Health
Secretary’s retention
allowance. This version does not otherwise attempt to explain the purpose of the
allowance and omits
any reference to the monetary rates relating to the
temporary allowance.
the following reasons, we determine that the interim award should be in the
terms proposed by the Health Secretary, with two qualifications.
Full Bench clearly decided to make an interim award for the payment of the
temporary allowance alone. Whilst the ongoing payment
of the Health
Secretary’s retention allowance was an important consideration that the
Full Bench took into account in deciding
to make the award, we did not
contemplate incorporating the Health Secretary’s retention allowance as an
award obligation.
The Health Secretary’s retention allowance is currently
payable by operation of a statutory determination − Determination
of 2024 made under
Health Services Act 1997
− as qualified by a directive from the Ministry of Health to Chief
Executives to pay that allowance to all psychiatry
staff specialists. The Full
Bench clearly stated its expectation that, at least as an interim arrangement,
the status quo in terms
of the Health Secretary’s
retention allowance should continue in tandem with the proposed award
Psychiatry Staff Specialists (No 2)
“It is clear from our reasons that the continuation of the payment of the
Health Secretary’s retention allowance during
the term of the interim
award is a critical underlying assumption on which we have relied in determining
the interim relief.
Should that change for any reason during the life of the
interim award, the parties are granted leave to apply to the Commission at
(Emphasis added)
Commission has recently recognised that it may be beneficial for parties to be
able to find all relevant conditions in a single
instrument, being the award,
instead of having multiple instruments in the form of an award and one or more
statutory determinations:
Award Review Principles Case 2025
NSWIRComm 1089
. However, the interim nature of the case advanced by
ASMOF on behalf of psychiatry staff specialists was not an appropriate occasion
for a comprehensive review or consolidation of the relevant instruments covering
these employees.
result is that the temporary allowance awarded by the Full Bench is in addition
to, not in substitution for, the Health Secretary’s
retention allowance.
It is appropriate that this be made clear by the terms of the interim
Accordingly,
the first qualification to the Health Secretary’s proposed award is that
cl 3.3 should be amended to state explicitly
that the award also does not
rescind or replace the Health Secretary’s retention allowance.
do not consider it necessary or appropriate for the interim award to contain a
statement of the underlying rationale or purpose
of the temporary allowance.
This has been expressed by the Full Bench in its decision to grant the
application for an interim award.
do, however, consider that it would be useful to the parties and the individual
psychiatry staff specialists for the interim award
to contain a table setting
out the value of the allowance in terms of the monetary rates for each
classification level.
Accordingly,
the second qualification to the Health Secretary’s proposed award is that
it should contain the section headed
“Part B – Monetary Rates”
appearing in ASMOF’s version of the proposed interim award, with a table
out the rates for the temporary allowance alone (excluding the column
for the rates relating to the Health Secretary’s retention
allowance).
we do not consider it necessary or appropriate to include ASMOF’s proposed
definition of “Psychiatry Staff Specialist”
in the Definitions
clause. This cohort is already adequately defined in cl 3.2 of both
versions of the interim award proposed by
Commission orders that:
(1) The Health Secretary is to file and serve a clean Word version of the new
interim award that reflects this decision by 4:00pm
on 24 October 2025.
