D E C I S I O N
HIS HONOUR: Mr Ronald Francis has appealed against the severity of the
penalty imposed on him by the Stewards at the hearing on
October 2007. The offence for which the appellant was before the
Stewards related to the elevated TCO2 level of his horse Scottish
raced at Geelong Harness Racing Meeting on 7 October 2007. A pre race
sample had been taken from the horse on that occasion
and when it was analysed,
returned a reading of 38.3 millimoles per litre and the reference test performed
the next day revealed
levels of 38.7 and 39 millimoles per litre respectively
and of course there is the 1 millimole per litre tolerance.
The horse had been shown on other occasions to have a base level of
TCO2 of somewhere between 32 and 33 millimoles per litre. On
this occasion
there was a significant elevation obviously. Mr Francis has indicated that
he is unable to explain the elevated reading
other than to say that it was not
through the administration of any substance on his part or in any way in which
he was complicit.
He has argued his plea himself before the Tribunal. He has
relied on several matters. Firstly, his affirmed denial of any action
own part by way of administration of an alkalising agent or any other substance
and he expresses concern about the high level
which to him is inexplicable and
he has expressed a concern that perhaps his horse is capable of producing an
elevated TCO2 level
by natural means.
Secondly, he relies on his record. It is indeed an excellent record.
He has been nearly 30 years in the industry, in what might
be called hobby
training. At the present time he has seven horses in work. He has full time
alternative employment where he works
night shift but he trains the horses in
the mornings with the help of his wife. In the 30 years of his training he has
never infringed
in relation to any drug administration or elevated TCO2 level on
any other occasion. Indeed it appeared in the transcript of the
proceedings that he had 168 samples of blood or urine taken from horses over the
years in relation to the TCO2 level and
none had been elevated. This was the
first one and he relies heavily on that excellent previous record. Those
matters are certainly
taken into account by this Tribunal.
On the other side it must be stated that the Harness Racing industry is
keen and entitled to be seen as clean of the problem of
drug administration to
horses. It is very important to the harness racing industry to have a clean
image in this regard and in order
to best assure that this will occur, the
industry relies on the Stewards and the Tribunal to impose penalties that act as
a sufficient
deterrent to trainers and owners and other licensed individuals
against infringing in any way in relation to drug administration
As is often the case with a sentencing exercise the Tribunal is faced
with a conflict. On the one hand it acknowledges the good
Mr Francis in the past and is prepared to take that into account. On the
other hand it has a responsibility to impose
a penalty which, as I have said,
acts as a sufficient deterrent not only to Mr Francis but across the
industry generally and those
involved in it. At this point I might say that
although I have been assisted in receiving advice from my colleagues, the
I have come to the conclusion that in all the circumstances the penalty
imposed by the Stewards of a fine of $8000 is excessive
circumstances. I consider that the Tribunal can both show appreciate of
Mr Francis's record on the one hand and also
provide a sufficient deterrent
in relation to this sort of matter by the imposition of a fine of $4000 and that
is the fine that
will be imposed.
MR ALSTERGREN: Thank you Your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Anything else Mr Alstergren?
MR ALSTERGREN: No Your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Yes thank you we'll adjourn.
