An Indigenous Perspective on Intellectual Property
By Linda Ford
Aboriginal customary law conceptualises our knowledge, our stories, in a very
different way from Western concepts of intellectual
The significance for us as the primary custodians of sites and objects, songs,
paintings, ceremonies and stories that belong to the
site or object, is utterly
linked with the primary custodians' knowledge, experiences and expertise of
that country, and/or family
group's estate. Our `country' refers not only to
the geography of the land, but to all the flora, fauna, and other natural and
elements of the land that come under Aboriginal Customary Law.
However, the debates about `intellectual property' provide Indigenous people
with the opportunity to have a voice in protecting our
cultural and society's
values. These debates establish an avenue to measure ideas of `ownership'.
My story is of the Rak Mak Mak Marranunggus- Marra Walgut language group of the
Finniss and Reynolds River country, situated south
west of Darwin in the
Northern Territory. Our White Eagle's Clan belief in those stories places us in
a unique blend of multiculturalism
and multilingualism. Our Mak Mak Marranunggu
history are lived experiences in Marranunggu, Marrithiel and North West Region
Our history told by our family groups currently uses the above
languages, plus Aboriginal English and Australian English and other
metaliteracies to express and record outlived experiences through the land we
Kurindju Yil Yil!
The way in which White Eagle people know our history today is entwined with the
present through younger members of our family and/or
those people that are
linked in the `Stolen Generations' returning to participate in Mak Mak
Marranunggu customary practices. The
older generation that were denied their
early childhood with their parents in their country are reclaimed into the
storylines, for
example by being claimed by their genealogical or kinship
system relationship to the characters in the story.
Aboriginal Land Rights (NT)Act 1976
(Cth) provided many Aboriginals
the opportunity to claim Crown land from the Australian government. However,
our family group and
many other Aboriginals in the Northern Territory were not
expecting the tortuous experiences that we as Indigenous people would endure
and suffer as a consequence of taking on the western system. Justifying our
Aboriginal knowledge was intense in this process, in
which an account of our
past and of our existence was concentrated into a small spectrum of our
Our history was raped, pillaged and is constantly questioned. For example,
Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people have developed and
tried to apply their
theories to our circumstances of land ownership. Yet these theories are always
inaccurate and lack authority,
for the family clan continue to assert that we
are the primary custodians and the land owning group, as we possess customary
for our country. Many reasons exist for us to make our land claims, which
we may not have disclosed, or which people may not understand.
Other people try
to confuse and mystify the situation about the land and the people that belong
there. But we know why we belong
there. We belong there through our law,
ceremonies, language, people and land connections.
The knowledge we have of our land and that which surrounds it is categorised
into various degrees of ownership of that knowledge:
as group ownership, clan
ownership, family group(s) ownership, inter-clan ownership, in-law ownership or
individuals' personal knowledge
and their interaction with the `country'. So
when Mak Mak Marranunggus are discussing ownership of knowledge it needs to be
who owns the knowledge. Often the person or group presenting the
information will specify where the source of the knowledge is derived.
Indigenous people, our knowledge is shared between family members and extended
family. An advantage of intellectual property debates
is that they offer an
opportunity to establish ground rules as to whether the property belongs to an
individual and/or one clan group.
There will be conflict as there has been in
the past. Northern Territory land claims have many examples of knowledge
leading to conflict.
As Indigenous Australia moves with the new emerging consumerism of a capitalist
society, our values will inevitably change. The concept
of intellectual
property of knowledge will create new ways in which our unique systems of
knowledge, from our language(s), law, ceremony
and our cultures, are expressed.
These different ways of expression will lead to many different possibilities
for understanding our
knowledge. New terms of reference for making informed
decisions about what to do with the clans' knowledge will cause unresolvable
disputes because the laws of the western system and those of Indigenous
Australia are not compatible.
What is clear is the need for a set of guiding principles. Mediators in the
western system of intellectual property need to be aware
of these principles so
appropriate acknowledgment is given to Indigenous people. Through serious
negotiations between the relevant
parties an amicable agreement should be
sought about ownership of the knowledge, whose property it is and, if the
knowledge is not
theirs, where the knowledge comes from.
