matter before the Court is the joint application for consent orders filed by [Mr
Giordano] ("the husband") and the Public Trustee
on behalf of [Ms Giordano]
("the wife"). Apart from the necessary procedural step of appointing the Public
Trustee as Case Guardian
for the wife, the application seeks orders for
alteration of property interests whereby the home at [Suburb A] ("the home")
registered in the sole name of the wife will be transferred into the
names of the parties as joint tenants, and the parties will
"otherwise retain
all right title and interest in all other assets owned in their respective
than being considered by a Registrar in chambers, as is usual when a joint
application for consent orders is filed, the matter
was listed for hearing
before me. That step was taken primarily because it is common ground that the
parties are not separated,
and their marriage remains intact. The question of
whether the Court can be satisfied that it is just and equitable to make any
order for alteration of property interests therefore squarely arises.
the reasons that follow, on the evidence presently available I am not so
The relevant legal principles
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth) ("the
") provides that the
Court "shall not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that,
in all the circumstances, it is
just and equitable to make the order".
prescribes matters which must be taken into account in considering what
order (if any) should be made. The "requirements of the
two subsections are not
to be conflated".
The Court must
not assume "that the parties' rights to or interests in marital property are or
should be different from those that
nor can the question of
whether making an order is just and equitable be determined "by beginning from
the assumption that one or
other party has the right to have the property of the
parties divided between them or has the right to an interest in marital property
which is fixed by reference to the various matters (including financial and
other contributions) set out in
can be no suggestion that the absence of a breakdown in the marital relationship
means that the jurisdiction of the Court is
not enlivened.
can be circumstances other than "a voluntary separation of the parties marking
the breakdown of their marital relationship"
in which the Court is nevertheless
satisfied that it is just and equitable to make an order for the alteration of
property interests.
circumstances which might lead to that conclusion are not in any sense
prescribed.
The presently available evidence
presently available evidence is contained in an affidavit of [Mr Kelly], [a
staff member of] the Public Trustee sworn on 11 July
2024, and the affidavits of
Mr Kelly and of the husband which verify the information set out in the joint
Application for Consent
Orders. The facts set out below are drawn from those
affidavits.
husband was born in [redacted], and the wife was born in [redacted]. They began
living together in [redacted] and were married
in [redacted] 1981. As earlier
noted, their relationship has not broken down; they are no longer living
together in the home as
the wife has moved into residential aged care. There
are no children of the marriage.
Trustee "is advised" that the purchase price
was paid in full, without any
borrowings being required, from the proceeds of "a superannuation payout when
the wife ceased work".
In the same affidavit, it is stated that the wife ceased
paid employment shortly
the purchase of the home. The discrepancy
is not explained. While the Court is not told just when in 1984 the property
was purchased,
the wife was either 48 or 49 years old at the time. The
circumstances of the asserted superannuation payout are not explained.
it is stated that the wife "owned a property at the commencement of the
marriage", but no details are provided. It may
or may not be that the purchase
of the present home was funded in whole or in part from the sale of another
property owned by the
wife prior to the relationship.
is no evidence as to why the home was purchased in the sole name of the wife.
The evidence of Mr Kelly is simply to the effect
that the husband has advised
that he only recently became aware that he was not on the title.
the husband's evidence, which is accepted by the Public Trustee, the husband
"subsequently contributed around $137,000 to the
marriage from compensation
payments in later years".
and no superannuation. Both are reliant on
aged pensions.
husband presently lives in the home. In submissions on behalf of the Public
Trustee it is said that the husband has "through
lawyers... indicated a
potential claim to [the home]" and that it is appropriate for the proposed
orders to be made so that "the
parties will not have to be involved in contested
Family Court proceedings". Elsewhere, it is said that the "parties intend in
future to sell [the home] and downsize, which will provide [the husband]
with a continuing residence". Again, no further detail
is provided.
Public Trustee was appointed as the plenary administrator of the wife's estate
by order of the State Administrative Tribunal
("SAT") [in] 2024. That order was
made on the application of [Helen Martin] lodged [in] 2023. No copy of the
application or supporting
documentation has been provided, and there is no
evidence as to Ms Martin's relationship (if any) with either party. I was
this morning that she is the wife's daughter from a previous
relationship.
appointment of the Public Trustee was made in the context of a declaration that
the wife is unable by reason of a mental disability
to make reasonable judgments
in respect of matters relating to all of her estate and matters relating to her
person and is in need
of a guardian and administrator.
(a) directed the Public Trustee to secure the wife's interests in the home
"including taking any action in relation to a transfer
signed by [the wife] [in]
January 2024 transferring a half interest in [the home] to [the husband]";
(b) noted an undertaking by the husband not to lodge that transfer "until the
Public Trustee has made the decision about whether
the transfer should be
lodged"; and
(c) revoked an Enduring Power of Attorney dated [redacted] by which the wife
apparently appointed [Helen Russo] to be her attorney.
filed documents did not indicate whether Helen Russo and Helen Martin are the
same person; I was told this morning that they
Power of Attorney was executed during the marriage but did not appoint the
husband. No explanation for that is proffered.
mention is made in the affidavit
of the execution of the
transfer document by the wife [in] January 2024 in circumstances where Ms Martin
had lodged her application
to the State Administrative Tribunal [in] 2023. No
evidence is given as to the circumstances in which that transfer was apparently
executed, nor for that matter whether it purported to create a joint tenancy, or
a tenancy in common.
am not told whether either party has a current Will. I am not told whether
there is any other person who might purport to have
a relevant claim, although
it appears that in an earlier (rejected) version of the application reference
was made in that regard
to Ms Martin.
Disposition
procedural step of appointing the Public Trustee as Case Guardian for the wife
in the proceedings commenced by the application
for consent orders is readily
taken. The Public Trustee is the manager of the affairs of the wife in the
relevant sense by virtue
of the order made by the State Administrative Tribunal
and has consented to the
appointment.
reasons which should be readily apparent from the summary just given, I cannot
be satisfied on the available evidence that it
is just and equitable to make any
order for alteration of property interests, let alone that the orders presently
proposed are just
and equitable in all the circumstances.
do not know whether the questions which emerge from the papers have been
adequately considered by the Public Trustee in the exercise
of his protective
duties to the wife. I accept that they may well have been - but the evidence
does not presently permit that conclusion
to be drawn.
from the matters already summarised, it is not at all clear that the parties
have adequately considered the fact that there
is but one exercise of the
Court's power to alter property interests. While the marriage has not broken
down, the wife's needs are
apparently presently being met and the husband
desires security of accommodation, the making of orders now would (subject only
the possible application of
preclude the making of further orders for
alteration of property interests should the relationship end.
matter was listed to today for directions. It was not overtly listed for
hearing and determination. It would be procedurally
unfair to dismiss the
application today in those circumstances, and I would not do so in any
appropriate course is to adjourn the matter to afford the parties the
opportunity to consider the observations made, and to adduce
further evidence in
support of the joint application should they wish to do so. It may be
that, on reflection, alternatives other
than the making of orders in this Court
are considered.
said, the application should not simply be adjourned generally such that it
remains on foot indefinitely. I propose, therefore,
to give the parties a
reasonable period in which to consider their options and to adduce further
evidence should they wish to do
so, failing which the application will be
