[1] On 27 August 2009, the Tribunal made findings of two counts of
unsatisfactory professional conduct and four counts of professional
misconduct:
see Legal Services Commissioner v Dempsey [2009] LPT 20 at [129]:
“The conduct in charge 1 showed a failure to
reach and maintain the reasonable standard of competence and diligence that a
of the public is entitled to expect of a reasonably competent Australian
legal practitioner and so represented unsatisfactory professional
pursuant to s 418(1)(a) of the 2007 Act. In the case of charge 5, that
unsatisfactory professional conduct also involved
the charging of excessive
legal costs contrary to s 420(b) of the 2007 Act. The conduct in charges
2, 3, 4 and 6 involved conduct
of an Australian legal practitioner in connection
with the practice of law that justifies a finding that he is not a fit and
person to engage in legal practice, and so represented professional
misconduct.”
[2] Following such a finding, the Tribunal may make any of the orders set out in
Legal Profession Act
(“the 2007 Act”), which
“(2) The tribunal may, under this subsection,
make 1 or more of the following in a way it considers appropriate –
(a) an order recommending that the name of the Australian legal practitioner
be removed from the local roll;
(b) an order that the practitioner’s local practising certificate be
suspended for a stated period or cancelled;
(c) an order that a local practising certificate not be granted to the
practitioner before the end of a stated period.
(d) an order that –
(i) imposes stated conditions on the practitioner’s practising
certificate granted or to be issued under this Act; and
(ii) imposes the conditions for a stated period; and
(iii) specifies the time, if any, after which the practitioner may apply to
the tribunal for the conditions to be amended or removed;
(e) an order publicly reprimanding the practitioner or, if there are special
circumstances, privately reprimanding the practitioner;
(f) an order that no law practice in this jurisdiction may, for a period
stated in the order of not more than 5 years –
(i) employ or continue to employ the practitioner in a law practice in this
(ii) employ or continue to employ the practitioner in this jurisdiction
unless the conditions of employment are subject to conditions
stated in the
[3] The Tribunal is of the view that Mr Dempsey was not “a fit and proper
person to be entrusted with the important duties
and grave responsibilities
which belong to a solicitor.”
Tribunal’s view he remains
[4] Mr Dempsey gave evidence on
re-examination about what he would have done differently with regard to the two
matters which were
the subject of the complaints before the Tribunal. These
were manifestly self-serving accounts of how he would have attempted to
that he did not prefer his own interests to those of his clients in the way in
which he did which, given his general lack
of contrition, carry little
[5] Mr Dempsey has been a practitioner for many years and suffered
ill health in late 2006 which has now been resolved. He has filed
references from respectable members of the community, employees and clients
attesting to his competence and honesty. The Tribunal
has taken all of those
matters into account in reaching its decision on penalty.
[6] The Tribunal
has also taken into account that Mr Dempsey gave untruthful evidence before the
Tribunal. It is of course a very
serious matter when the view is taken that a
legal practitioner has not told the truth on oath. As Ipp JA said in Davison v
of New South Wales Bar Association
[2007] NSWCA 227
is ample authority to the effect that untruthfulness in giving evidence in
disciplinary proceedings may be taken into
account in considering what order
should be made: see
Barwick v Council of the Law Society of New South
[2004] NSW CA 32
and the authorities therein referred to at
[7] The courts, fellow practitioners and clients cannot have confidence in a
legal practitioner who has been untruthful on oath.
A person who has been found
guilty of the counts of professional misconduct and unsatisfactory professional
conduct alleged in this
matter and displayed such dishonesty on the disciplinary
hearing is not a fit and proper person to be entrusted with the duties and
responsibilities of a legal practitioner and the Tribunal recommends that his
name be removed from the roll under s 456(2) of the
Tribunal was minded to order a stay of this order for 21 days to enable an
orderly transition of the practice and to protect
the interests of Mr
Dempsey’s existing clients. However, Mr Dempsey failed to be fully candid
with the Tribunal and further
information relevant to the Tribunal’s
determination was disclosed by Mr Dempsey’s counsel after the further
with regard to penalty. The Tribunal has no confidence in a
practitioner who has failed to be fully candid in these circumstances
will not grant a stay. It would not be in the interests of his clients for a
stay of the Tribunal’s orders to be granted.
Compensation for
[9] The respondent has agreed to orders being made for compensation to
Mrs Oats. The quantum of that compensation depends on the
difference between
what Mr Dempsey was entitled to charge and what he did charge. Further evidence
was led after the disciplinary
hearing as to the quantum of compensation and the
findings set out herein reflect the evidence previously led and the further
[10] Section 481C of the Queensland Law Society Act 1952
(“the 1952 Act”) set out the maximum that Mr Dempsey was entitled
charge. He was entitled to charge no more than the statutory
[E-(R+D)] x 0.5.
“E” is the amount Mrs Oats was
entitled to by way of settlement;
“R” is the total amount of
money which the client must refund from the settlement under an Act of the law
of the Commonwealth
or another jurisdiction;
“D” is the total
amount of disbursements Mrs Oats must pay, or reimburse, to the practitioner or
firm in relation to the
speculative personal injury claim.
[11] The amount
Mrs Oats was entitled to by way of settlement was $50,000. A refund of
$1,396.20 was paid by Mrs Oats to the Health
Insurance Commission (HIC).
Disbursements were said by Mr Dempsey, in a statement sent by him to Mrs Oats on
19 November 2009, to
be $15,150 plus GST of $297.88. An analysis of those
disbursements shows that $1,793.40 was for photocopying and for fees, not in
fact a disbursement. So the total disbursements was $13,356.60. It is not
clear what the GST of $297.88 relates to.
[12] Mr Dempsey was, therefore,
entitled to charge legal fees of no more than
[$50,000 (E) –
($14,752.80 ($1,396.20 (R) + $13,356.60 (D))] x .5 = $17,623.60.
[13] He was
entitled to charge fees of $17,623.60. Refunds were $1,396.20 (which Mrs Oats
paid herself) and disbursements of $13,356.60.
Mr Dempsey was therefore
entitled to recover $30,980.20 (for fees and outlays); HIC was entitled to
$1,396.20; and Mrs Oats was
entitled to recover $17,623.60 from the
[14] Of the $50,000 settlement moneys, $8,116.01 was paid to HIC
(from which Mrs Oats was refunded $6,719.81) and $41,883.99 was paid
Dempsey’s trust account. Mr Dempsey also received a net payment from Mrs
Oats of $6,328.93 ($11,960 paid by her less
a refund to her of $5,631.07). Mr
Dempsey therefore received $48,212.92, of which he was entitled to retain
$30,980.20. He therefore
received $17,232.72 in excess of his
entitlement.
[15] He should repay those moneys to Mrs Oats. That would leave
her with $23,952.56, being $17,623.60 damages and $6,328.96 repayment
paid by her to Mr Dempsey.
[16] Mr Dempsey should pay compensation to Mrs
Oats of $17,232.72 (which should include $7,579 standing to the credit of Mrs
in Mr Dempsey’s trust account).
[17] Section 462(1) of
the 2007 Act provides that the Tribunal must make an order requiring a person
whom it has found guilty of unsatisfactory
professional conduct or professional
misconduct to pay the costs of the Commissioner unless satisfied that
exceptional circumstances
exist. There are no exceptional circumstances in this
case. The respondent should pay the applicant’s costs on a standard
to be assessed.
