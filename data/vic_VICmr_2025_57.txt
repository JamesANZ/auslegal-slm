Notice of Decision
I have conducted a review under section 49F of the
Agency’s decision to refuse access to documents requested by the Applicant
under the FOI Act.
The Agency applied the exemption under section 30(1) in its original
decision, but during the review it advised that it no longer
sought to apply
this exemption to any of the documents.
The Applicant confirmed during the review that they did not require any
personal affairs information. The names, signatures and contact
details of third
parties as contained in the documents are therefore irrelevant to the scope of
the Applicant’s request.
My decision on review is that the documents are to be released to the
Applicant with any irrelevant personal affairs information removed
under section
The Schedule of Documents in
sets out my decision in
relation to each document.

of the Agency’s decision to refuse access
to documents.
the review, the Agency notified OVIC of its intention to reconsider its original
decision and make a fresh decision in accordance
with section 49M(1).
Agency requested an extension of two weeks to make its fresh decision, which I
approved. However, a fresh decision was not made
within the agreed timeframe,
and I proceeded with my review based on the Agency’s original decision, as
required under section
Agency provided OVIC with a copy of the fresh decision it intended to make,
along with reconsidered copies of the documents, which
I considered as a
submission.
intended fresh decision was to no longer rely on section 30(1) to refuse access
to documents. Accordingly, I have not considered
this exemption in my
the reconsidered copies of the documents, the Agency only applied section 25 to
remove certain irrelevant personal affairs information
of third parties from the
the Applicant confirmed to OVIC staff that they do not require any personal
affairs information of Agency officers or any other
individuals, I have only
considered the application of section 25 to the reconsidered copies of the
documents provided by the Agency
during the review.
undertaking my review, I have had regard to the object of the FOI Act, which is
to create a general right of access to information
in the possession of the
Government or other public bodies, limited only by exceptions and exemptions
necessary to protect essential
public interests, privacy and business
note Parliament’s intention the FOI Act must be interpreted so as to
further the object of the Act and any discretions conferred
by the Act must be
exercised, as far as possible, so as to facilitate and promote the disclosure of
information in a timely manner
and at the lowest reasonable cost.
Section 25 – Deletion of exempt or irrelevant
information
25 requires an agency to grant access to an edited copy of a document where it
is practicable to delete exempt or irrelevant
information and the applicant
agrees to receiving such a copy.
whether it is ‘practicable’ to delete exempt or irrelevant
information requires an agency or Minister to consider:
(a) the effort involved in making the deletions from a resources point of
(b) the effectiveness of those deletions – that is, whether the edited
document still has meaning.
information is information which is clearly outside the scope, or beyond the
terms of the applicant’s request.
stated above, the Applicant advised they do not seek access to personal affairs
information about any third party. Therefore, such
information is irrelevant
information for the purpose of my review.
am satisfied the documents contain irrelevant personal affairs information.
have considered the effect of deleting irrelevant information from the
documents. In my view, it is practicable for the Agency to
delete the irrelevant
information, because it would not require substantial time and effort, and the
edited documents would retain
the information before me, I am satisfied the personal affairs information in
the documents is irrelevant information to be deleted
from the documents under
section 25.
I am satisfied it is practicable to provide the Applicant with an edited copy of
the documents with irrelevant information deleted
