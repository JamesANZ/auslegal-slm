MAGISTRATE STEWART:
A. The issues
decision concentrates on the following issues:
(a) Sentencing a young offender who is aging out of the youth justice system;
(b) Serious criminal offending whilst subject to conditional liberty;
(c) The causative effect of trauma and social deprivation upon a young
person’s capacity to rehabilitate;
(d) The tension between refusing bail to safeguard against the risk of
re-offending and granting bail in observation of the youth
justice principles;
(e) The tension between the requirement to observe the principles of sentencing
and the requirement to give primary consideration
to rehabilitation of young
B. The charges and their facts
decision deals with eight series of multiple charges. Axl (a pseudonym) has
accepted full responsibility for his criminal offending
by entering guilty pleas
to each of the charges. It is easier to follow the series of offending by
including factual summaries along
is important to note that Axl was sentenced for an earlier significant series
of criminal offending on 7 September 2023:
Police v Axl Joseph
ACTCC 1. It is unusual to commence a sentence decision by referring to an
earlier sentence – however in this matter
it is important because the
timing and outcomes of those sentences have a repetitive influence on this
interaction of bail and re-offending is a feature of this decision. The
chronological detail of bail decisions has been included
to inform the
Series one:
(a) CH 409/2024 – Aggravated Burglary – Intent to Steal in
contravention of s 312 of the
Criminal Code 2002
) (maximum penalty 2000 penalty units or 20 years
imprisonment or both).
(b) CH 410/2024 – Ride Motor Vehicle without Consent in contravention of s
318 of the CODE (maximum penalty 500 penalty units
or 5 years imprisonment or
offences occurred on 18 December 2022. The first time that Axl appeared before
the Court on these allegations was 3 June 2024.
This is a significant and
unexplained delay in the commencement of proceedings that (potentially)
prevented this series from being
dealt with in Axl’s September 2023
7.11am on 18 December 2022, ACT Police received a report that a Jeep Cherokee
and a black Audi were stolen from the residence of

black Audi was found by police at 2.28pm that day. The facts do not note any
damage to the vehicle. Police arrested three young
people later that day. One
of the co-young people was in possession of a telephone that contained

Axl was charged as a rider and not the driver.
Axl was charged with the series one offences he was already before the Court
facing some of the other charges that form part
of this decision. The alleged
behaviour was already old. This explains why the laying of the series one
charges did not interfere
with Axl having his bail

formally refused bail on that date.
C. Objective seriousness of the offending
two most prevalent offences to be considered are aggravated burglary and
ride/drive motor vehicle without consent.
R v Rosewarne
identified the following factors as informing the objective seriousness of
burglary offences:
(a) Whether the offence was committed at commercial or residential premises
(where the occupants are likely to feel a greater sense
of violation) and, if at
residential premises, whether it was the main premises or an associated building
(such as a garage) that
was entered.
(b) Whether the premises were occupied or were likely to be occupied at the time
of the entry.
(c) Whether the victim was vulnerable; for example, if the main residence was
entered, whether the victim at home alone and asleep.
(d) The means of entry; for example, whether it was forced entry or entry via a
partly open door.
(e) The degree to which there was associated destruction or disarray.
(f) Whether there was an interaction with an occupant and, if so, whether the
occupant was directly threatened and the nature and
duration of any force or
threat (including whether it was gratuitous).
(g) For aggravated burglary (committed in company)—whether the offender
was in the company of more than one other person, the
role played by the
offender, and whether there was an additional aggravating feature of having an
offensive weapon.
(h) The degree of planning, which may be able to be deduced from whether the
offender was disguised and/or had armed himself with
an offensive weapon or
implement for the purpose of gaining entry.
R v Massey (No 3)
[2021] ACTSC 156
, Taylor J identified the
following factors as informing the objective seriousness of ride/drive motor
vehicle without consent offences:
(a) The period of driving and the
length of distance driven.
(b) The Whether the vehicle was used in the commission of another offence.
(c) Whether the offender was the driver and not only a passenger.
(d) The manner of the driving – though allowance must be made depending
on whether the manner of driving is subject to a
separate charge, which may be
dealt with by the concurrency or partial concurrency of any sentences.
(e) Whether the vehicle was damaged.
(f) Whether the vehicle was returned to the owner, which may be related to the
issue of whether the offender is likely to have continued
to drive the vehicle
for some further time had he or she not been intercepted by police.
Police v Jarod Bender
out some further youth-specific observations at
This Court regularly deals with the offence of
Ride/Drive Motor Vehicle Without Consent in the context of young offenders. The
only ever sees a single offender involved when the offending involves the
use of a motorcycle, moped or scooter. Even then a pillion
passenger is
sometimes involved. The very nature of young offending is that the joy is
derived from sharing the experience with passengers.
Absent passengers, it is
highly likely that this type of offending would not occur with young
is a not a significant amount of information on the circumstances of the
aggravated burglary offence (CH 409/2024). The premises
were a home. The cars
left the home at about 5.10am which is a time when residents would be expected
to be home. The main residence
was entered. Multiple people were in the home.
Access was gained by a laundry door. It is not clear how many offenders were
but three entered the home. There is no evidence of sophisticated
planning. It is offending that lies in the mid-range of objective
seriousness.

There is no evidence of significant planning other than checking for a manner of
entry and the use of
two offenders. The offending lies in the mid-range of
objective seriousness.
joint commission theft (CH 1004/24) inside the home involved stealing car keys,
$250.00 cash and the garage fob. It was theft

D. Breach files
CH248/2023 – Aggravated furious, reckless, dangerous driving in
contravention of s7(1) of
the Road Transport (Safety and traffic Management)
was convicted and sentenced to a 3-month suspended sentence upon entering into a
12-month GBO from the date of sentence. Axl
also received a 24-month licence
disqualification that remained in effect for all of the offending to be dealt
with in this sentence.
aggravating features of this charge were that on 2 February 2023 Axl failed to
stop for police, drove in excess of the speed limit
by more than 30% and drove
with three people under 17 years old in the vehicle. Axl was driving for a
period of approximately 15
minutes and travelled through various streets in
vehicle consistently travelled at speeds well over the speed limit. During the
pursuit, Axl undertook vehicles in front of him
and almost collided with the
gutter on three occasions. Axl crossed double unbroken lines on five occasions
and swerved onto the
wrong side of the road towards an unmarked police vehicle
with lights and sirens activated. He also drove on the wrong side of the
and caused other vehicles to take evasive action.
driving involved an unsuccessful attempt to swerve around a police vehicle, and,
after colliding with it continuing to accelerate
forward and push past the
police vehicle. The road conditions were dark. There was obvious traffic.
driving only ended after tyre deflation devices were successfully deployed by
police. It was obvious that Axl was attempting
to evade police. He was in
breach of bail conditions that were imposed to prevent him from driving. He
attempted to flee the scene
and was pursued by police on foot. He was on bail.
All of those were aggravating features.
CH198/2023 –
Culpable drive/neg/grievous bodily harm in contravention of
Crimes Act 1900
was convicted and sentenced to 9 months imprisonment (reduced from 12 months on
account of a guilty plea), suspended after 7 months
and 6 days, on condition
that Axl be on a 12-month GBO.
facts of this matter were that Axl was the driver of a stolen white Jeep that
was seen by police who were in a marked police car
on 27 December 2022. There
was a pursuit that lasted about 10 minutes over a distance of 5 kilometres.
Aspects of Axl’s dangerous
driving included driving at excess speed,
dangerously overtaking another vehicle and causing evasive action to be taken by
vehicle, driving through a red light and entering the incorrect side
of the road and driving on that road at speed.
the pursuit ended, police saw that the Jeep had crashed into a Mazda at an
intersection in Scullin. The Mazda suffered significant
damage and the victim
was trapped in the vehicle. An analysis of data obtained from the Jeep’s
airbag deployment control revealed
that five seconds prior to the airbag
deployment time, the vehicle was traveling at 123km/h in the 80km/h zone on the
of a dual carriageway and towards oncoming traffic.

CH1492/2022 – Aggravated furious,
reckless, dangerous driving in contravention of
the Road Transport
(Safety and traffic Management) Act
was convicted and sentenced to a 24 month GBO to be served concurrently with the
CH198/2023 GBO. This is the GBO that has been
breached by all of the offending
to be dealt with in this sentence.

E. Mandatory sentencing
considerations
S33(1)(f) – effect on victims
Bettiol, who is one of the victims from the home invasion in series five, read
his victim impact statement onto the record. What
he said was unsurprising to
the Court. It was hoped that his words and the emotion with which he delivered
them had a lasting impact
Bettiol spoke to the deep and ongoing family disruption that Axl’s
offending had caused. The family continues to suffer
the psychological effects
of having an intruder inside their home who stole valuable items from them.
Family members have lost the
previous personal security that they had felt in
their home.
family continues to be fearful of being alone at home and were initially fearful
of repeated offending due to the theft of the
house keys.
offending occurred prior to what was supposed to be his daughter’s
graduation. Because of the effects of the offending
the Bettiol family did not
attend that graduation.
Bettiol’s have lived in their home for 12 years. The effect of
Axl’s offending on them was “gut wrenching”.
Court should expect that the other victims in other series would have
experienced similar outcomes. One’s home is generally
a source of
comfort, safety and security. Those feelings are disturbed by home invasions
and theft. A person’s car is a significant
asset and more than just
inconvenience is suffered when an insured car is stolen. Staff at bottle shops
are expected to suffer stress
and emotional impacts from store theft.
are the usual reported effects of crime that Courts may take judicial notice of
in the absence of express victim impact statements.
S33(1)(h) and
(n) - financial circumstances and whether any reparation has been made
far as the Court is aware, Axl has never worked. His financial position has not
been the subject of submissions, but it is obvious
that he is not in a position
to make any reparation for his offending. Those words require balance. Because
Axl has spent so much
of his teen years in custody he has not had a proper
opportunity to seek work.
S33(1)(i), (j) and (w)–
responsibility taken, pleas of guilty and remorse
has taken complete responsibility for his offending. It was obvious to me that
he experienced great discomfort when hearing the
effect of his criminality upon
the Bettiol family. Axl has not displayed any pride in his criminality. These
are all compelling
signs of remorse in a young offender.
entered pleas of guilty to each offence. Many of the series involved him
wearing masks or hooded garments. It would appear that
the pleas of guilty have
significant utilitarian value. The guilty pleas have also spared the victims
and witnesses the time and
stress of appearing in Court. They have saved the
Court and the community the cost of such hearings.
is no dispute that Axl should receive the full 25 per cent discount for the
value of his guilty pleas.
echoes the youth justice principle of encouraging young people to take
responsibility for their offending.
Applying significant sentencing discounts for guilty pleas is one of the few
ways that the Court may take an active part in such
encouragement.
S33(1)m – Axl’s cultural background,
character, antecedents, age and physical and mental condition
is a 17 years and eight months old proud Ngemba man.
Court’s assessment of Axl’s character is that he is a young man with
great potential who has so far wasted the opportunities
he has had to show this
Court has observed the light of character and intellect behind his eyes. It is
obvious that he is well-liked by those who spend
time with him. They are always
pleased to see him and there appears to be a genuine bond between Axl and the
people who attend Court
with him that are doing their best to support him.
despite the determined efforts of many, Axl has shown limited capacity to turn
away from serious criminal offending. His capacity
to make others smile is only
matched by his capacity for committing serious crime.
offending dealt with in his previous sentence was Axl’s first entry into
criminal offending in this jurisdiction. Axl’s

history contains a varied array of criminal offending. Other than for series

totality for young offenders. It sets out that
when a young person is to be
sentenced, imprisonment must be both a last resort and (imposed for) the
shortest appropriate term.
A combination sentence of imprisonment and a
supervised good behaviour order must also be considered.
I. Consideration
Court must pay particular attention to individualised justice when sentencing a
young person.

that if he remains in custody until after he turns
18, that will mean that he
will go onto waiting lists for public housing. This was a significant factor
that was considered.
Court must recognise the deep effects of trauma upon Axl. His past does not
excuse his behaviour, but it goes a long way to explain
why Axl has been in such
a deep groove of self-destructive offending. The flip side of that is the Court

show that bail was often granted despite the opposition

sentencing purposes in this jurisdiction are defined as (at
(Sentencing) Act
ACT) adequate punishment, deterrence, community
protection, promotion of rehabilitation, making an offender accountable,
denunciation
and recognising harm done. When these purposes are then overlaid
by a requirement to give primary consideration to rehabilitation
offenders, it reveals the tension between principles that is present when
sentencing young offenders. The tension is particularly
strong where criminal
offending is serious and nothing less than sentences of imprisonment are
appropriate.

Mossop J said in
DPP v Baker
“On the one hand, the
denunciation of the conduct, recognition of harm done to the victims and their
families and general deterrence
would all favour a very substantial sentence of
imprisonment. On the other hand, the offender with his dysfunctional family

These were related offending types and not so

three. Each of those breaching

Series one:
Consideration
was given to the delay in commencement of these charges. It is not possible to
guess what sentences would have been
imposed if these matters were dealt with in

other sentence than sentences of imprisonment were appropriate.
(a) CH 409/2024 – Aggravated Burglary – Intent to Steal. Convicted
and sentenced to 21 days imprisonment reduced from
30 days. This sentence is
backdated to allow for some concurrency with the previous breach sentence to
allow for totality. The
21 day sentence is backdated to commence on 22
September 2024 and end on 12 October 2024 (time served). This concurrency
for totality.
(b) CH 410/2024 – Ride Motor Vehicle without Consent. Convicted and
sentenced to rising of the court (time served).
Series two:
199. The minor theft did not call for a sentence of imprisonment. I found
that the dishonesty conviction alone was a significant
(c) CH 246/2024 – Minor Theft. Convicted with no further punishment.
(d) CH 248/2025 – Drive Motor Vehicle without Consent. Convicted and
sentenced to 67 days imprisonment reduced from 90 days
for the guilty plea.
Backdated to date from 26 September 2024 to 1 December 2024. This concurrency
allows for totality. This sentence
has been served.
(e) CH 251/2025 – Unlicenced – Licence never held (repeat offender).
Convicted and disqualified for 3 years.
Series three:
this series totality was allowed for in two ways – the partial concurrency
with the prior series and total concurrency within
the series itself. The same
approach was taken on each remaining series so that the total sentence was not
crushing on Axl and also
left appropriate discretion for the commencement of a
suspended sentence. The sentences on this series have been served.
(f) CH 1003/2024 – Joint Commission Theft. Convicted and sentenced to 21
days imprisonment reduced from 30 days on account
of the plea. This was
backdated to commence in 1 November 2024 and end on 21 November 2024.
(g) CH 800/2024 – Aggravated Burglary. Convicted and sentenced to 135
days imprisonment reduced from 180 days for the guilty
plea. This sentence is
backdated to commence on 1 November 2024 and end on 15 Mar 2025.
(h) CH 1004/2024 – Joint Commission Theft.
Convicted and sentenced to 21 days imprisonment reduced from 30 days for the
plea. This sentence is backdated to commence on 1 November 2024 and end
on 21 November 2024.
(i) CH 799/2024 – Take motor vehicle without authority. Convicted and
sentenced to 67 days imprisonment reduced from 90 days
for the guilty plea.
This sentence is backdated to commence on 1 November 2024 and end on 6 January
(j) CH 801/2024 – Unlicenced – Licence never held (repeat offender).
Convicted and disqualified for 3 years concurrent
with the disqualification on
CH 251/2025.
Series four:
this series parity has had a considerable effect on reducing the start points.
The start points for the co-young people were mercifully
low. Axl has been
sentenced with higher start points than his co-accused for his offending due to
his age, criminal history and
the fact that he was on conditional liberty at the
time of offending. Each of these sentences has been served.
(k) CH 1267/2024 – Fail to appear after bail undertaking. Convicted and
sentenced to rising of the court (time served).
(l) CH 1257/2024 – Ride/Drive Motor Vehicle without Consent. Convicted
and sentenced to 90 days imprisonment reduced from
120 days for the guilty plea.
This sentence is backdated to commence on 1 February 2025 and end on 1 May
(m) CH 1265/2024 – Obtain Property by Deception. Convicted with no
further punishment.
(n) CH 1259/2024 – Attempted Aggravated
Burglary. Convicted and sentenced to 90 days imprisonment reduced from 120 days
the guilty plea. This sentence is backdated to commence on 1 February 2025
and end on 1 May 2025.
(o) CH 1258/2024 – Attempted Aggravated Burglary. Convicted and sentenced
to 90 days imprisonment reduced from 120 days for
the guilty plea. This
sentence is backdated to commence on 1 February 2025 and end on 1 May 2025.
(p) CH 1260/2024 – Joint Commission Aggravated Burglary. Convicted and
sentenced to 135 days imprisonment reduced from 180
days for the guilty plea.
This sentence is backdated to commence on 1 February 2025 and end on 15 June
(q) CH 1263/2024 – Joint Commission take Motor Vehicle without Consent.
Convicted and sentenced to 67 days imprisonment reduced
from 90 days for the
guilty plea. This sentence is backdated to commence on 1 February 2025 and end
on 8 April 2025.
(r) CH 1271/2024 – Ride/Drive Motor Vehicle without Consent. Convicted
and sentenced to 42 days imprisonment reduced from
60 days for the guilty plea.
This sentence is backdated to commence on 1 February 2025 and end on 14 March
Series five:
202. Each of the sentences in this series has been served.
(s) CH 1514/2024 – Burglary – Intent to Steal. Convicted and
sentenced to 112 days imprisonment reduced from 150 days
for the guilty plea.
This sentence is backdated to commence on 1 May 2025 and end on 20 August
(t) CH 1515/2024 – Take Motor Vehicle without
Authority. Convicted and sentenced to 67 days imprisonment reduced from 90 days
for the guilty plea. This sentence is backdated to commence on 1 May 2025 and
end on 6 July 2025.
(u) CH 106/2025 – Unlicenced – Licence
never held. Convicted and disqualified for 3 years concurrent with the
disqualification
on CH 251/2025 and 801/2024.
(v) CH 1516/2024 – Unlawful Possession of Stolen Property. Convicted and
sentenced to 10 days imprisonment reduced from 14
days for the guilty plea.
This sentence is backdated to commence on 1 May 2025 and end on 10 May 2025.
Series six:
(w) CH 73/2025 – Ride/Drive Motor Vehicle without consent. Convicted and
sentenced to 67 days imprisonment reduced from 90
days for the guilty plea.
This sentence is backdated to commence on 1 July 2025 and it ended on 5
September 2025.
Series seven:
sentences in this series traverse the past, present and future. The obtain
property by deception charge did not call for a sentence
of imprisonment. I
found that the dishonesty conviction alone was a significant penalty. It was
not appropriate to suspend any
part of this series.
(x) CH 328/2025 – Joint Commission Aggravated Burglary. Convicted and
sentenced to 135 days imprisonment reduced from 180
days for the guilty plea.
This sentence is backdated to commence on 1 August 2025 and end on 13 December
(y) CH 329/2025 – Joint Commission theft.
Convicted and sentenced to 21 days imprisonment reduced from 30 days for the
plea. This sentence is backdated to commence on 1 August 2025 and end on
21 August 2025.
(z) CH 331/2025 – Joint Commission take Motor Vehicle without Consent.
Convicted and sentenced to 67 days imprisonment reduced
from 90 days for the
guilty plea. This sentence is backdated to commence on 1 August 2025 and end on
6 October 2025.
(aa) CH 330/2025 – Obtain Property By Deception. Convicted with no further
punishment.
Series eight:
minor theft did not call for a sentence of imprisonment. I found that the
dishonesty conviction alone was a significant penalty.
start point for the aggravated burglary offence was considerably higher as there
was a persistent effort by Axl to enter
the premises in the early hours of the
morning and there was an interaction between several of the offenders and a
young occupant.
206. The sentences all commence on 1 November 2025 and are suspended from
Monday 15 December 2025. This means that Axl will be released
on one set of
suspended sentences only and has some time to organise accommodation prior to
becoming an adult. The suspended portion
of the sentence is significant and it
is hoped that it will dissuade Axl from re-offending and promote his
rehabilitation.
suspended sentence order will date from 15 December 2025 to 31 July 2026 and
have supervision in place for the whole of the order
as well as other conditions
to be read out to Axl.
(bb) CH 391/2025 – Aggravated Burglary. Convicted and sentenced to 273
days imprisonment reduced from 365 days for the guilty
plea. This sentence will
commence on 1 November 2025 and end on 31 July 2026.
(cc) CH 944/2025 – Ride/Drive Motor Vehicle without consent. Convicted
and sentenced to 67 days imprisonment reduced from
90 days for the guilty plea.
This sentence will commence on 1 November 2025 and end on 6 January 2026.
(dd) CH 945/2025 – Drive while disqualified.
Convicted and disqualified for 2 years – cumulative as to one year on the
other three disqualifications – total disqualification period of four
years imposed.
(ee) CH 389/2025 – Minor Theft. Convicted with no further punishment.
(ff) CH 388/2025 - Ride/Drive Motor Vehicle without consent. Convicted and
sentenced to 67 days imprisonment reduced from 90 days
for the guilty plea.
This sentence will commence on 1 November 2025 and end on 6 January 2026.
(gg) CH 946/2025 – Drive while disqualified. Convicted and disqualified
for 2 years – cumulative as to one year on the
other three
disqualifications and concurrent with 945/2025 – total disqualification
period of four years imposed.
(hh) CH 390/2025 – Aggravated Burglary – Convicted and sentenced to
135 days imprisonment reduced from 180 days for the
guilty plea. This sentence
will commence on 1 November 2025 and end on 15 March 2026.
