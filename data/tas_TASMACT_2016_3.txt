INTRODUCTION
1 The applicant was apparently injured in a motor vehicle
accident and received scheduled benefits for a period of time. However,
appears that a determination was made by the respondent to cease paying travel
and treatment expenses in relation to any alleged
injury suffered by the
applicant as a result of that motor vehicle accident. The applicant made a
referral to the Tribunal seeking
a review of that determination by the Board,
such referral was received by the Tribunal on 18 February 2016. An application
made on behalf of the respondent to have that referral dismissed for want
of prosecution by the applicant.
DETERMINATION
2 After receipt of the reference by the Tribunal, a telephone
directions hearing was held on 4 March 2016. At that time counsel for
respondent outlined that reliance would be placed upon material which it is
asserted indicated that past claims for travel expenses
made by the applicant
did not have a factual justification and further that the applicant’s
treating general practitioner had
expressed an opinion that he was now fully
recovered from the effects of any injury suffered in the motor vehicle accident.
The applicant
took issue with these assertions and at the conclusion of the
directions hearing, the Tribunal directed that the respondent, within
provide any medical reports they intended to rely upon together with an outline
of the surveillance evidence they intended
to rely upon in relation to this
matter. The Tribunal further directed that the applicant had 28 days upon
receipt of that material
to provide any medical evidence he intended to rely
3 The matter was adjourned on notice and relisted for telephone
directions on 28 April 2016. At that time, counsel for the respondent
that on 11 March 2016 he had forwarded to the applicant a full copy of the
surveillance report and the report from the treating
general practitioner that
would be relied upon by the respondent. At this time neither he nor the
Tribunal had had any communication
from the applicant, and the applicant was
unable to be contacted by the Tribunal for the purposes of that telephone
directions hearing.
4 Subsequent to this the Tribunal wrote to the applicant
outlining the directions that had been previously given and noting his
noncompliance
with directions made for him to provide medical evidence he
intended to rely upon. The direction was repeated to the applicant and
advised that the matter would be relisted subsequent to the further 28 days that
had been granted to the applicant to provide
his medical evidence. Advice was
given that should he fail to comply with that direction the Tribunal
foreshadowed that the respondent
may make an application to have his reference
dismissed and that this might also involve an application for costs in respect
5 A notice of hearing was forwarded to the applicant on
or about 15 June 2016 notifying him as to a hearing before the Tribunal on
6 The applicant failed to attend that hearing, and a formal
application was made by the respondent to have the reference dismissed
of prosecution. A further application was made that upon dismissal of the
reference that the applicant be ordered to pay
the respondent’s costs of
and incidental to the reference.
7 At the hearing, the Tribunal made such
orders and the reasons are set out following.
8 Regulation 15 of the Motor
Accidents Compensation Tribunal Regulations 2009 provides that:
reference may be discontinued or dismissed for want of prosecution in accordance
with the practice applicable in the Supreme
Court for the discontinuance or
dismissal for want of prosecution of an action.”
9 It is accepted that
such power provides a general discretion, the operation of which is guided by
certain matters including the
length of delay, explanation for delay, hardship
or prejudice suffered by either party and the conduct of the respective parties.
In this case the respondent disclosed at a very early stage the basis upon which
it had taken the challenged action of disputing
an ongoing entitlement to the
applicant. The respondent complied with directions made by the Tribunal to make
complete disclosure
to the applicant of the documentary evidence it was to rely
upon. On the basis of the outline of dispute given by counsel for the
respondent, there was clearly a strong case to support the action taken by the
respondent.
10 The applicant was provided advice by the Tribunal as to the
steps he needed to take to advance his case but he failed to comply
directions given in that regard, failed to attend a listed directions hearing,
failed to comply with directions allowing him
further time to produce supporting
medical evidence and then failed to attend at a hearing of this matter at which
he was made aware
that an application to dismiss his reference was likely to be
11 There has therefore apparently been no step taken by the applicant
to advance his case and no explanation given as to why he has
not complied with
the directions given nor attended at hearings listed by the Tribunal. The
maintenance of this reference will only
add costs for the respondent. However,
the dismissal of this reference need not bar the applicant from making a future
should he incur a treatment expense of the type encompassed in this
reference, and the respondent refuses to meet the cost of
12 Accordingly the balance of circumstances favours an order that the
reference be dismissed.
13 There is nothing in relation to the conduct by the
respondent that ought to displace the normal rule that costs follow the event
and accordingly it is ordered that the applicant pay the respondent’s
costs of and incidental to this reference. As is the
practice of the Tribunal,
it is ordered that such costs be drawn at the rate of 85% of the fees set out in
Part 1 of Schedule 1 of
the Supreme Court Rules 2000.
