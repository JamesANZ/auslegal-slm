Respondent:

Respondent:
Ms A Hogan, Solicitor for Public Prosecutions
agree with the order proposed by Osborn JA for the reasons that his Honour
is an application for leave to appeal an interlocutory decision pursuant to
Criminal Procedure Act 2009
applicant is charged on indictment with 10 charges in the County Court. Only
three of these charges are the subject of the present
application, namely:
trafficking in a drug of dependence, namely methylamphetamine, in a quantity not
less than a commercial quantity.
possession of a drug of dependence, namely
methylamphetamine.
— dealing with the proceeds of crime, namely $14,090 in cash, being
negligent as to whether it was the proceeds of
is defined in s 70(1) of the
Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act
). It includes ‘to have in
possession for sale, a drug of dependence’.
2, 3 and 10 are brought in reliance upon evidence obtained on 5 October 2022
when members of Victoria Police executed a search
warrant at the
applicant’s place of residence.
the search, police found 451.5 grams of methylamphetamine in eight individual
‘Glad Snap Lock Bags’ in a purple
suitcase (charges 2 and 3)
together with cash totalling $11,000 (charge 10). The suitcase was located
inside a wardrobe adjacent
to the accused’s bed.
in the flat, police located two sets of digital scales, Glad Snap Lock Bags and
multiple small snap lock bags, further quantities
of cash and methylamphetamine,
and other drugs.
prosecution sought to establish the accused’s knowledge and possession of
the methylamphetamine and cash found in the suitcase
through a combination of
circumstantial evidence including the following:
(a) the apartment is a small studio apartment with no bedroom;
(b) the accused had been the sole resident of the apartment for over one year at
the time of his arrest;
(c) when he rented the apartment it was thoroughly cleaned and emptied. There
were no belongings of previous residents that remained
(d) on 5 October 2022, a search warrant that had been issued was executed by
police at the apartment;
(e) a purple suitcase was located in a cupboard close to the accused’s
bed. In the outer lower pocket of the suitcase two bags
were located which
contained clip-seal bags with methylamphetamine;
(f) in the outer top pocket $11,000 was located;
(g) the accused’s DNA was located on the clip-seal bags as well as DNA of
other contributors.
pre-trial application was made to her Honour Judge Dawes to exclude the
evidence, relating to the purple suitcase, pursuant to
, which provides:
In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by
the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed
by the danger of unfair
prejudice to the accused.
a careful and comprehensive ruling, her Honour excluded the DNA evidence but
permitted the prosecution to lead the proposed evidence
as to the circumstances
of the finding of the drugs and cash in the suitcase. Her Honour analysed the
force of the circumstantial
evidence as follows:
However, I consider that evidence relating to the finding of the suitcase and
its contents, being the drugs and the cash, are in
a very different position. In
the absence of the DNA evidence relating to them, they are highly probative in
their own right. The
fact that a suitcase containing drugs and cash was found in
a cupboard, a very short distance from the accused’s bed in this
small apartment that he occupied for at least a year is strong evidence by
itself, in support of the proposition that the accused
knew of the suitcase and
its contents. It was not there when he rented the apartment. It was there around
one year later and it was
not hidden or concealed. It is in a similar
evidentiary position to the other items of the drug trafficking evidence found
in the apartment.
I can see no real prejudice to the accused arising from the admission of this
evidence, other than the support it gives to the prosecution
case and that it is
not unfair prejudice.
While the accused contends that the admission of the suitcase evidence
necessarily calls for an explanation, and this may breach
his right to silence,
this issue is of concern in all criminal cases when the evidence appears to
accumulate against the accused.
The accused can challenge the relevant evidence.
Criticism can be made of the police not recording, photographing or retaining
purple suitcase, or part of its contents, being the absence of a thorough
investigation. A forensic disadvantage direction can be
given to deal with the
deficiencies. Ultimately, it is the decision of the accused whether he chooses
to give evidence.
This disputed prosecution evidence, in combination with the other evidence,
provides a strong circumstantial case that the accused
possessed the drugs
located in the purple suitcase. The jury can take all the information into
account, including assessing the matters
put to the witnesses in
cross-examination. I am not satisfied that it is appropriate for the court to
intervene in the leading of
this evidence before the
applicant now challenges this ruling and submits:
(a) The circumstantial case for the prosecution as to knowing possession is
weak. It is not informed by DNA or fingerprint evidence.
The police officer who
gave evidence about the suitcase has no recollection of whether the whole of the
suitcase was searched or
if it was, what was inside. The search and opening of
the suitcase were not video-recorded and only rudimentary and inadequate photos
of the suitcase were taken. The suitcase itself was not seized. Identification
documents belonging to another person were located
near the suitcase in
circumstances where the DNA of two contributors other than the applicant were
found on the bags of methylamphetamine
within the suitcase. The other person
whose identification documents were found has not been investigated.
(b) The evidence is unfairly prejudicial. First, there is a significant risk
that the jury will give it undue weight. Secondly, there
is an unacceptable risk
the jury will speculate as to the contents and whereabouts of the suitcase and
the applicant cannot fairly
meet this risk by giving evidence in the
circumstances which have arisen.
respondent submits that the evidence in issue is cogent proof of the offences
charged and that it is not unfairly prejudicial.
applicant does not contend that the evidence, taken at its highest, fails to
establish the elements of charges 2, 3 and 10. What
is submitted is that,
although the evidence regarding the contents of the suitcase comprises relevant
and potentially admissible
evidence that the applicant had the relevant drugs in
his possession for sale, such evidence and the evidence of the cash in the
suitcase should nonetheless be excluded.
interpolate that s 5 of the
provides a statutory basis for
evidence of possession in respect of the possession charge (charge 3) in the
present case
but does not provide a
basis for concluding that the applicant had the drugs in issue in his possession
as required for the
trafficking charge (charge 2).
the purposes of charge 2, it is necessary for the prosecution to establish not
only that the applicant knowingly had the drugs
possession,
but also the purpose of
that possession.
completeness, I add that s 73(2) of the
states that where
a person has in their possession not less than a ‘traffickable
quantity’ of a drug of dependence, the
fact of possession provides prima
facie evidence of trafficking.
the present case, (it appears) the drugs found in the suitcase comprised a
traffickable quantity as defined in s 70(1) of the
Nonetheless,
for the purposes of s 73(2), ‘possession’ of a traffickable
quantity must be established by proving knowing
possession in accordance with
the common law. Section 5 of the
, does not apply to possession
for the purpose of s 73(2).
prosecution did not invoke s 73(2) on the pre-trial application. If however it
were invoked, it would raise the same central factual
issue of knowing
possession which the applicant seeks to reagitate in this application.
turn then to that issue. Considering the matter without the benefit of the
presumption contained in s 73(2) as the trial judge did,
the force of the
evidence with respect to trafficking in the present case derives from the full
circumstances in which the drugs
discovered,
and the conjunction
of the finding of the drugs, in the relevant circumstances, in this particular
location, with packaging appropriate
for sale in the suitcase and other drug
trafficking paraphernalia in the
do not accept that the trial judge erred in concluding that, taken at its
highest, the circumstantial case is relatively strong.
The combination of
circumstances upon which the prosecution relies enables an inference to be drawn
that the applicant had the drugs
in his possession for the purpose of sale and
that the cash constituted proceeds of crime with which the applicant dealt.
as it is submitted that the admission of such evidence is unfair, I again agree
with her Honour’s conclusion. The relativities
of circumstances upon which
the applicant relies are all capable of exploration in cross-examination before
the jury. They are factual
matters which are eminently suited to evaluation by a
jury. The failure to take further investigative steps following the discovery
the contents of the suitcase is also susceptible of a forensic disadvantage
is not uncommon in cases in which the prosecution invites a jury to infer
intention from objective facts, for the accused to be
placed in a position where
the probability is that inference will be drawn unless it is rebutted in
evidence adduced by the defence.
There is nothing inherently unfair in this
situation. It reflects the inherent practical difficulty involved in proving an
state of mind. In
Williams v The
Aickin J said:
it is necessary to bear in mind that in possession there is a necessary mental
element of intention, involving a sufficient knowledge
of the presence of the
drug by the accused. No doubt in many cases custody of an object may supply
sufficient evidence of possession,
including the necessary mental element, but
that is because the inference of knowledge may often be properly drawn from
surrounding
circumstances.
the above reasons, the application for leave to appeal should be refused.
Because this is an
interlocutory proceeding, a pseudonym has been used in place of the name of the
applicant and the reasons have
been prepared in a form which omits identifying
