Dent v Director of Public Prosecutions (SA) [2024] HCASL 328 (5 December 2024)
RONSEL INVESTMENTS PTY
[2024] HCASL 310
applicant requires an extension of time within which to seek special leave to
appeal from the whole of the judgment of the Court
of Appeal of the Supreme
Court of Victoria (Beach and Lyons JJA), refusing leave to appeal from the
judgment of the Supreme Court
of Victoria (Niall JA), which in turn refused
an extension of time to appeal the orders made by Daly AsJ on 23 July
2020 and 6 October
2021, summarily dismissing an action for negligence
against the applicant's former solicitor, and dismissing a further action for
negligence against the applicant's former solicitor for want of prosecution.
applicant's proposed grounds of appeal have no prospects of success and do not
raise any questions of general principle. It would
therefore be futile to grant
the extension of time that is sought.
leave to appeal is refused.
