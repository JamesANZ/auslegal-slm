in substantial changes to the Agreement.
The Commission sought the views of
the Australian Workers’ Union (“AWU”), which was a bargaining
representative

Variation to the
In considering the Agreement, the Commission identified two errors.
Clause 1.1 provided the name of the Agreement, but had a lower-case
of I in the name “InvoCare”. The same error appeared in the
definition of “Agreement” in clause
4.1. I formed the
provisional view that this was “an obvious error, defect or
irregularity” capable of being corrected
under section 218A(1) of the
I raised this matter with the parties. InvoCare confirmed that these
were errors which were likely to have been caused by converting
documents across

vary the Agreement under section
218A(1) to correct the errors. I have
determined to proceed accordingly.
Order – Variation
I make the following order which takes effect on the date of this
(1) Clause 1.1
of the Agreement and the definition of “Agreement” in clause 4.1 of
the Agreement are amended so as to
replace “lnvoCare” with
“InvoCare”.
