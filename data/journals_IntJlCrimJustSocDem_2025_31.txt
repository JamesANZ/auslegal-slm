The Anthropocene epitomises the apex of
humanity’s millenary effort to exert domination over the uncontrollable:
John McPhee illustrates in
The Control of Nature
however, such ascendency, if it occurs at all, is ephemeral, for it fails to
master natural events. Instead, it manifests
as a crude exercise of power marked
by practices of exploitation and destruction of the natural realm, which
ultimately backfires
on humanity itself.
Stacy Banwell’s
The War Against Nonhuman Animals: A Non-Speciesist
Understanding of Gendered Reproductive Violence
portrays human
self-destructive arrogance towards nature. Violence and suffering pervade this
volume, which depicts industrial profit-driven
exploitation of nonhuman animals
via reproductive violence. Banwell frames these abuses within the context of a
‘species war’
scenario: ‘we are currently engaged in a war
against nonhuman animals, this war involves industrialised slaughter as well as
industrialised reproduction’ (36). War, understood as a legal category and
as a concept of domination, is the architrave of
this book, which allows Banwell
to highlight intricate connections between infrahuman wartime atrocities and
capitalist-oriented
industrialized reproductive violence against nonhuman
Situated at the crossroads of multiple disciplines and within the horizon of
ecofeminist theories,
The War Against Nonhuman Animals
is a testament to
Banwell’s distinguished contribution to feminist perspectives on
international humanitarian law. Through
a critical and intersectional lens,
Banwell bridges the neoliberal practices of objectification and exploitation of
nonhuman animal
sexuality with broader patterns of victimisation rooted in
speciesism, sexism, racism and human exceptionalism.
Divided into five chapters, the book develops its premise—we are at war
against nonhuman animals—into a comprehensive
analysis on the importance
of conceptualising such pervasive violence in war terms. In a robust
introductory chapter, Banwell reinterprets
international humanitarian law (IHL)
to advocate for nonhuman animal protections. She then contends that IHL applies
under the condition
that nonhuman animals are granted the status of passive
legal personhood, grounded on the right not to suffer (Chapter 2). Without
falling into ‘dreaded comparisons’ (113), Banwell’s analysis
then seeks to identify the common nature, targets,
and, ultimately, the source
of oppressions informing gendered violence—rape, forced pregnancy, and
sexual violence—constituting
both intra-human war crimes and the routine
violence that occurs within the dairy, egg, and milk animal-industrial
complexes. Crude
examples of such violence enrich the analysis (Chapter 3 and
4). Banwell then concludes by exposing the thanatopolitical violence
informs human exceptionalism, concluding that the war against nonhuman animals
ultimately affects those who wage it: Humans
(Chapter 5).
Banwell’s multi-optical analysis offers routes for criminologists to
explore several landscapes of often-invisible harms related
to human violence
against nonhuman animals within industrial chains. Here, I wish to emphasise
what I believe is this book’s
main contribution: Reading the connections
between carnisms, speciesism and the animal-industrial complex through the
lenses of ‘war’
to highlight the destructive cycle of capitalist
nature exploitation.
At first glance, the connection between war and capitalist exploitation of
nonhuman animals may seem contentious. Although violence
informs both, their
underpinnings are different. The underlying logic of war-related violence is
founded on the domination and destruction
of the opponent. In contrast,
industrial exploitation rests upon exploitative and extractive logics aimed at
capital accumulation.
In terms of theoretical frames, the doctrine of
humanitarianism is based on the concept of legal personhood, while the legal
of private property underpins extractivism.
The War Against Nonhuman Animals
in its entirety, I believe
that Banwell employs this apparently unrelated and contradictory connection
precisely in order to dismantle
the readers’ preconceived certainties. By
claiming ‘the war against nonhuman is ironically then a war humans wage
themselves’ (245), Banwell intelligently and creatively conveys
the message that capitalist-driven exploitation of nonhuman
animals drags humans
into a downward spiral of self-destructive violence.
Such violence, arguably, erodes the capitalist-driven structure of the
animal-industrial complex. One could here recall Nancy Fraser’s
reading of Karl Polanyi’s concept of ‘fictitious
commodities’—basically, anything treated as a market
commodity that
is not or was not created for the market, such as land/nature, labour, and
money. In Fraser’s work, unrestrained
commodification tends to cause
market crises. This can be seen in
The War Against Nonhuman Animals
Banwell demonstrates that the profit-oriented hyper exploitation of nonhuman
animals leads to collateral harms—such as
antibiotic resistance, zoonotic
diseases, and environmental degradation—which, in turns, destabilises the
animal-industrial
exploitative system. By incorporating aspects of carnism and
speciesism into her analysis, Banwell extends intersectional critiques
fictitious commodification of both labour and nature to encompass nonhuman
On a deeper level, although
The War Against Nonhuman Animals
the suffering of nonhuman animals, this is ultimately a book about processes of
human victimisation
. More specifically, Banwell exposes how those human
labourers within mega-farms share with nonhuman animals the status of
victim’ due to the all-consuming physical and
psychological violence informing carnist ‘battlefield’ places
Furthermore, Banwell appears to point towards a more profound level of
victimisation—one that encompasses humanity as a whole.
Premised upon
human exceptionalism and capitalism, the animal-industrial complex is not simply
a concept employed to highlight the
extermination of living beings; it also
encompasses the fabricating and destruction of entities that are never treated
as alive to
begin with—the ‘deading life’ (194). Such
thanatopolitical commodification of nonhuman animals ruptures the sense
human by reducing us (humans) to mere ‘administrators of death’
(194-195). This is the ‘paradox of the
biopolitical dream’ (217-218)
that Banwell exposes so lucidly: By normalizing the unspeakable suffering
inflicted on nonhuman
animals to satisfy mundane human needs, we descend into a
feral state that contradicts the premises of superiority used to justify
violence against nonhuman animals, and more broadly, against nature.
Ultimately, the breadth of these reflections prompts us to consider whether
the biopolitical and thanatopolitical power underpinning
the capitalist and
speciesist violence against nonhuman animals reduces our lives in a mechanistic
cycle of life-consumption-death.
Do we live, or rather
perpetuate capitalism’s rituals of death, which reduce us to mere
consumers of dead bodies? Are we, ultimately, victims
of our same violence?
The structural violence inherent in the animal-industrial complex is a
specific yet pervasive facet of the overarching violence that
informs relations
between humans and nature. By giving a voice to nonhuman animals,
Against Nonhuman Animals
brings this violence within our homes and daily
routines: for example, when we purchase eggs or milk at the supermarket, are we
in this violence? Regardless of one’s personal stance,
Banwell’s book undoubtedly instils a sense of uneasiness in the
Banwell’s contribution to critical criminological strands rests in her
ability to cut through the veil of ignorance
and indifference that fosters our
societal epistemic violence towards nature. By addressing a specific facet of
this violence—that
against nonhuman animals—Banwell conveys the
message that control over nature is a chimera. The invocation of IHL thus seems
to carry a symbolic rather than practical significance: it represents the hope
for a post-humanist relational equilibrium between
humanity and nature founded
on moral limits to humans’ inner propensity for annihilative dominance. At
stake is the very essence
of what it means to be human.
