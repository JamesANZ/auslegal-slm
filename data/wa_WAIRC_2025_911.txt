properly notified of this hearing in accordance with

may proceed in his absence.

that his appearance was not required as the onus
is on the applicant to show why
the application ought not be dismissed.

heard on why his application ought not be dismissed
for want of prosecution.
Further, the applicant has not given an adequate response to the
respondent’s jurisdictional objection,
nor any response to the
Commission’s requests seeking the applicant’s views as to the

matter, and he has not done so.

failed to progress his application and does not
have sufficient interest in the
