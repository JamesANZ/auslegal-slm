Victorian Legal Services Commissioner
A notice made under s.
318 of the Legal Profession Uniform Law (Victoria)
Commissioner Determination (Failure to provide itemised
bill) [2018] VLSC 22
Date of Determination:
24 June 2018
Pursuant to section 299(1) of the
Legal Profession
Uniform Law (Victoria)
(‘the Uniform Law’), I find that the
Respondent Lawyer has engaged in unsatisfactory professional conduct and I make
the following order –
The Respondent
Lawyer is reprimanded pursuant to section 299(1)(b) of the Uniform Law.
STATEMENT OF REASONS
Respondent Lawyer is the Principal of the Law Practice and has acted on behalf
of the Complainant in various matters.
2 December 2015 the Respondent Lawyer provided a tax invoice to a company as
trustee for the Complainant’s Family Trust.
4 December 2015 the Complainant requested an itemised bill from the Respondent
Respondent Lawyer did not provide an itemised bill in accordance with this
request within 21 days or at all.
Issues under
investigation
following allegations have been investigated:
fees in dispute were being held by the Respondent Lawyer in trust;
basis upon which the Respondent Lawyer paid a barrister and himself without the
Complainant’s approval and without a Cost
failure to provide mortgage and court documents to the Complainant when
Respondent Lawyer’s failure to respond to the Complainant;
Respondent Lawyer’s failure to provide an itemised bill after the
Complainant made a request for one; and
Respondent Lawyer’s refusal to return the Complainant’s file/s
despite holding a security for costs, and after the
Complainant requested an
itemised bill.
Investigation
15 January 2016 a delegate of the Victorian Legal Services Commissioner sent a
letter to the Respondent Lawyer that gave notice
of the complaint and advised
that a prior complaint had been withdrawn. The Complainant was concerned that
several matters raised
in his original complaint remained unresolved. The
Respondent Lawyer was asked to contact the Commissioner to discuss his response
to the Complainant’s unresolved concerns.
5 February 2016 the Commissioner sent an email to the Respondent Lawyer noting
his failure to respond to the Complainant’s
concerns and requested a
response to these. The Respondent Lawyer provided a response by email dated 17
February 2016, which noted,
amongst other things, that he held a lien over the
file and documents as his bill remained unpaid. He also confirmed that the
Complainant
had requested an itemised bill.
9 March 2016 the Complainant and Respondent Lawyer were advised by email that
following the Commissioner’s unsuccessful attempt
to resolve the complaint
informally, a disciplinary investigation would be commenced.
letters dated 31 March 2016 and 9 October 2017, the Commissioner requested
submissions from the Respondent Lawyer. The Respondent
Lawyer provided
submissions in response dated 21 April 2016 and 12 March 2018,
respectively.
letter dated 11 May 2018 the Commissioner advised the Respondent Lawyer of the
findings of the investigation to that date, the
concerns regarding his conduct,
invited written submissions or material regarding whether the conduct should be
characterised as
unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct,
and the Commissioner’s proposed order pursuant to section 299
Uniform Law. Notice of the Commissioner’s proposed order was also given to
the Complainant on this date.
email dated 16 May 2018 the Complainant provided submissions regarding the
proposed order.
Respondent Lawyer did not provide a response to the Commissioner’s letter
dated 11 May 2018.
Findings of fact on issues under
investigation
the basis of the available evidence, I find the following proved:
the Respondent
Lawyer did not provide an itemised bill in accordance with a request by the
Complainant on 4 December 2015, within
21 days of the request or at all.
Relevant law
Uniform Law applies to the conduct, the subject of the findings of fact, as
it occurred after 1 July 2015.
Characterisation of the
187(1) of the Uniform Law states that if a bill is given by a law practice in
the form of a lump sum bill, any person who
is entitled to apply for an
assessment of legal costs to which the bill relates may request the law practice
to give the person an
itemised bill.
187(2) of the Uniform Law states a request for an itemised bill must be made
within 30 days after the date on which the legal
costs become payable.
187(3) of the Uniform Law states that the law practice must comply with the
request within 21 days after the date on which
the request is made in accordance
with subsection (2).
2 December 2015 the Respondent Lawyer provided a tax invoice to the Complainant
and on 4 December 2015 the Complainant requested
an itemised bill.
Respondent Lawyer has confirmed the request for an itemised bill but has not
provided one.
by reason of the above finding of fact, I find that the Respondent Lawyer has
not complied with his obligation pursuant
to section 187 of the Uniform Law.
298(a) of the Uniform Law prescribes that, without limitation, conduct capable
of constituting unsatisfactory professional
conduct includes conduct consisting
of a contravention of the Uniform Law.
because the Respondent Lawyer continues to fail to provide an itemised bill when
requested, his conduct fell below the
expected standard of competence and
diligence. This conduct thereby constitutes unsatisfactory professional conduct
pursuant to section
298 of the Uniform Law, and warrants a
Determination
light of the above and having considered all of the evidence and relevant law, I
determine that it is fair and reasonable in all
the circumstances to make the
order detailed above.
to section 314 of the Uniform Law, a respondent lawyer or a legal practitioner
associate of a respondent law practice may,
in accordance with the applicable
legislation, appeal to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal or seek a
review by the
VCAT of this determination made under section 299 of the Uniform
Russell Daily
Delegate of the Victorian
Legal Services Commissioner
