On 7 June 2025, the tenant requested to keep four-year-old small Domestic cat
and various Tropical fish in a six-to-ten foot tank
(collectively referred to as
‘the requested pets’) at the premises, following the process
established in the
Residential Tenancies Act 1987
(WA) (RTA).
Application
On 10 June 2025, the landlord applied to Consumer
Protection for approval to refuse the tenant’s request.
landlord’s refusal was on the grounds that:
Keeping the
requested pet at the premises is likely to cause damage to the premises that
could not be repaired for less than the amount

The landlord provided the following evidence:

The tenant did not provide any evidence to Consumer Protection.

The Commissioner may approve this application if satisfied that the ground
claimed by the landlord is established. In this case, the
claimed ground
the requested pet at the premises is likely to cause damage to the premises that
could not be repaired for less than the amount
of the security
The landlord is responsible for demonstrating that this
ground applies.
The Commissioner may set conditions on the approval of the tenant’s
Reasons for
As a delegate of the Commissioner, I have reviewed all evidence. Only the
evidence relevant to deciding this application is mentioned
in these reasons for
Is keeping the requested pet at the premises likely to cause damage to the
premises that could not be repaired for less than the bond?
A security bond of $2,680.00 is held with Bonds Administration for this tenancy.
As the tenant has requested two different species
of pets, I will be considering
the refusal of each requested pet separately.
Requested cat
In written submissions to Consumer Protection the landlord raised concerns over
the requested cat potentially urinating inside the
premises and ‘marking
his territory’ which would damage the wooden flooring. The landlord
provided a written statement
from [redacted], which states “if a male cat
marks its territory, you cannot get it out of the wood and it would need
replacing”.
The tenant has stated that the requested cat is neutered, and toilet trained.
The Cat Clinic states the benefits of neutering a cat
Less spraying. Intact male cats (and females) mark their territory by
spraying walls or any other vertical surface. Neutered males
are less likely to
spray, and their urine is not as strong smelling as an intact male’s
[redacted] website on neutering cats
Cats spray urine to communicate their sexual status, and desexing
significantly reduces this behaviour.
The landlord has not provided any evidence to show the requested cat is likely
to spray in the premises, or how general cleaning
products may be inefficient in
cleaning any spray.
Having regard to the information before me, I am not satisfied that the
requested cat is likely to cause damage to the premises that
could not be
repaired for less than the security bond.
Requested tropical fish
In written evidence
to Consumer Protection, the landlord stated the timber flooring throughout the
premises is no longer in production.
The landlord is concerned that any damage
to the flooring caused by the requested Tropical fish would require replacing
all the timber
flooring, as matching replacements are not available.
The landlord submitted the following as evidence towards the cost of having to
replace the timber flooring at the premises if they
are damaged by the requested
tropical fish:
A quote from

statement from [redacted] “if water was to get on the wood and left, it
would eventually swell and become damaged and
could not be fixed”.
The landlord has not provided adequate evidence demonstrating how, or why, the
requested tropical fish and the six-ten ft fishtank
damage that would exceed the bond.
Considering the information from the landlord, I am not satisfied that keeping
the requested tropical fish at the premises is likely
to cause damage to the
premises that could not be repaired for less than the security bond.
Condition for the requested tropical fish
While I am not satisfied that keeping the requested tropical fish is likely to
cause damage to the premises that could not be repaired
for less than the
security bond, I acknowledge the landlord’s concerns over potential damage
to the wood flooring.
Accordingly, I have decided to impose the following condition to mitigate the
risk of damage from keeping the requested tropical

The tank must be placed on a sturdy surface which
can adequately support the weight of the filled tank.
