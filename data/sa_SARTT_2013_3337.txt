SAHT v Popczynski & Popczynski v SAHT; SAHT v Pawelzik [2013] SARTT 3337 (20 February 2014)
REASONS FOR ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL MADE ON 20 FEBRUARY
Hearing 20 February 2014 at Adelaide
POPCZYNSKI v SOUTH AUSTRALIAN HOUSING TRUST
(RT13/3337)
The SAHT sought orders for vacant possession against the tenants due to their
failure to pay for water. The tenant Popczynski sought
an order reinstating the
tenant and requiring the SAHT to pay him an amount he said was owed to him.
The tenants both live in SAHT accommodation which consists of blocks of units
and where there is no separate water meter for each
unit. The SAHT relied on a
term of the residential tenancy agreement which required the tenants to pay for
“..to pay to the Trust on demand the amount from time to time assessed
for additional water in respect to the property or such
proportion thereof as
the Trust may determine and absolve the Trust from the responsibility for
payment of charges
The SAHT also relied on various provisions in their enabling legislation
which they claimed allowed them to recover water from the
tenants and a letter
written to tenants in about April 2008 stating that where tenants did not have a
separate water meter, the SAHT
would pay for 30% of the water used and the
tenants would have to bear the balance of the cost.
The tenants disputed the SAHT’s entitlement to claim for water and
relied on another letter which had been sent to tenants by
the SAHT (in 2007)
and which stated that tenants would not be charged until units were separately
The RTT finds that the tenants must pay for water.

SWORN EVIDENCE
was given in person by:
Todd Wierenga
ON BEHALF OF THE LANDLORD
TENANT Aleksander Popczynski
I accept that a notice of termination dated 6 May 2013 was served on the
tenant because of a debt owed to the landlord.
The notice of termination is correct. The tenant did not pay the overdue
water costs by the due date. This terminated the tenancy.
I refer to the order of the Tribunal made on 11 February 2014 which made a
determination as to the validity of the Trust’s assessment
of water costs.
The tenant indicated that he intended to appeal this decision but has not, as
yet, done so. I explained to Mr Popczynski
during the hearing the order of the
Tribunal stands until it is varied or set aside.
I am satisfied the tenant is currently indebted to the South Australian
Housing Trust in the sum of $497.80 for outstanding water
I have taken into account all the evidence, including Mr Popoczynski’s
income, and have decided the tenant can stay at the premises
and make payments.
If the tenant misses a payment the landlord may apply to the Tribunal to end the
tenancy without first serving
a notice of termination on the tenant.
(made under
Section 110
of the Act):
tenancy is reinstated.
tenant must pay $20.00 per fortnight on Friday 28 February 2014 and then every
fortnight until the outstanding water costs of
$497.80 are paid in full. If the
tenant misses one of these payments in the following six months the landlord may
apply to the Tribunal
to terminate the tenancy without serving a notice of
termination.
