SCOTT PURDON v JANET HEATHER CAMERON (No. 2)
REASONS FOR DECISION
14 December 2023 I delivered my reasons for finding the charges proved on each
of complaint 91069/19 and 92055/19. The proceedings
were then adjourned for a
sentencing hearing on 28 March 2024; and the hearing of an application made by
the defendant that the prosecutor
pay her costs, even though the prosecution was
successful.
the meantime, the defendant filed a notice to review the determination of guilt,
Justices Act 1959
A determination of guilt is an
‘order’ which may be reviewed under the
Justices Act 1959
given the extended meaning of
‘conviction, dismissal of a complaint, determination, and
adjudication’
19 February 24, Mr O’Shannessy for the
wrote to my
“...the position of Defence is that the most
appropriate course is for the proceedings both in respect of sentence and costs
(“the proceedings”), to be adjourned sine die pending the
determination of the Supreme Court of Tasmania in respect of
a Notice to Review
in respect of the orders made by His Honour on 14 December 2024 last. The
preparation by both the Crown and Defence
in respect of the proceedings ahead of
28 March will expose the Crown and Ms Cameron to significant costs which, if the
review is successful, may negate entirely the need for preparation for
and hearing of matters regarding sentence. If the notice
to review is
successful and the resulting outcome is re-trial preparation and hearing of any
costs application will need to be prepared
and heard again.”
is uncontroversial that criminal proceedings should be expeditiously resolved.
These proceedings have already involved an extended
period taken to give reasons
for the findings of guilt. A determination of guilt is an unremarkable event
within criminal proceedings.
Sentence should follow except in an exceptional
case. This is not an exceptional case. There is a significant public interest
in the finalisation of these particular proceedings. The defendant’s
submission is that this Court, having found her guilty,
should now step out of
the way to save her the cost of the sentencing hearing in the event she succeeds
on appeal. This is not a
good submission.
I adjourned sentencing
and the motion to review was
unsuccessful, the defendant would likely be required to be sentenced by another
magistrate, who would
need to read the lengthy reasons for decision and probably
a good proportion of the evidence. That must be avoided if possible.
administration of justice is served by proceedings taking their ordinary course
towards finality. The fact that a defendant files
a motion to review a finding
of guilt must is not something that should deflect the court from the duty to
conclude the proceedings.
the sentencing of the defendant
upon her filing a motion to
review, on the grounds advanced, would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute. The application
is refused.
am grateful to counsel for the Crown referring me to
Wilson v The Queen
[2016] ACTCA 56 (Refshauge
J) which provides a fuller discussion of the relevant
principles and authorities relevant to the point on this application.
