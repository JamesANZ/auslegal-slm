2 Commencement,
revocation and replacement
This Determination:
(a) commences and comes into force on the day after the end of the period of
2 years beginning on the day this instrument is registered;
(b) revokes the
Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards (Household
Refrigerating Appliances) Determination 2012
(c) replaces that determination.
