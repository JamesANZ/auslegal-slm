REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
Lucadou-Wells (“the applicant”) claims that the proposed site rental
increase by Emmetlow Pty Ltd (“ the respondent”)
was excessive and
he seeks an order that the site rental increase be reduced. The application is
made pursuant to section 70(2)
Manufactured Homes (Residental Parks)
2003 (the “MHRP Act").
respondent is the owner and operator of the Colonial Village Park situated at
351 Beams Road, Taigum (“the park”)
and the applicant is the owner
of a manufactured home situated on site 38 located at the park.
respondent says the park is made up of 139 sites consisting of:
manufactured home sites;
(b) 7 caravan
(c) 19 holiday
cabin sites; and
(d) 52 on-site
long term rental home sites.
Originally,
the local Council had approved the construction of 5 home sites and a tennis
court on the land just to the left of a large
drain that intersected the park.
Years later, the manufactured homes situated on these 5 sites were demolished
and a 14 room motel
was built instead and an 8 room motel, with a restaurant and
units, was built on the tennis court site. It was not disputed that
motel was built on the 5 manufactured home sites and the tennis court.
23 November 2001 the applicant entered into an agreement with the respondent to
occupy site 38 and has resided at this location
ever since.
formula provided for an annual rent increase was provided for in this site
agreement and, so far as relevant, provides:
“The said application fee will be determined on September
each year by applying the following formula to the
occupancy fee existing during the preceding twelve month period:
where ‘R’ represents the annual fee during the preceding
twelve month period, x represents the increase in Local Authority
applicable to the Park, ‘z’ represents the increase in State Land
Tax applicable to the Park, ‘y’
represents the number of sites in
the Park and ‘C’ represents the percentage increase of the Consumer
Price Index for
the preceding financial year.”
22 September 2008 the respondent forwarded a notice of rental increase pursuant
to section 69 of the MHRP Act. The notice provides
that the respondent:
hereby notifies you that, pursuant to
Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003
(Qld) (“the
Park owner wishes to increase the Site Rent payable under your Site Agreement
from $151.00 per week to $161.36 per week (GST inclusive),
representing an
increase of $9.86 per week. This new Site Rent is the proposed increased site
rent for the purposes of this notice.
proposed increased Site Rent has been calculated on the basis set out in your
Site Agreement which states that the Site Rent will
be reviewed on the
day of September each year by applying the
following formula to the site rent fee existing during the preceding twelve
month period:
where ‘R’ represents the annual fee during the previous twelve
month period, ‘x’ represents the increase in
Local Authority charges
applicable to the Park, ‘z’ represents the increase in State Land
Tax applicable to the Park,
‘y’ represents the number of sites at
the Park, and ‘C’ represents the percentage increase of the Consumer
Price Index for the previous financial year.
This calculation is as follows:
(i) R = $151.50;
(ii) C = 1.051 (CPI for Brisbane – 5.1%);
(iii) x = $298.57 ($15,526.00 per annum divided by 52 weeks);
(iv) z = 0;
(v) y = 139; and
(vi) calculation = [($151.50 x 1.051) + ($298.57 ÷ 139) + (0)] which is
equal to [$159.22 + $2.14] which is equal to $161.36.”
applicant says there were 61 sites at the park and not 39 sites as claimed by
the respondent a difference of 22 and the difference
being the number of motel
applicant in his statement says:
In using the formula ‘R x C + (y
for increasing site rents, I dispute the number of sites
that the park owner has used to calculate with - the ‘y’ factor.
The park owner stipulates there are 139 sites, when there is actually 161 sites
to be used in the calculation. This is a difference
of 22 or 16%”.
applicant’s statement of claim repeats this allegation. It says:
The Site Rent increase using the formula ‘R x C + (y
y)’ is excessive due to costings being divided
by139 sites instead of 161, a difference of (16%) 22. The applicant seeks to
have the Site Rent reduced.”
Applicant’s submissions
applicant submits that the site rent increase was excessive and should be
reduced as the number of sites in the park or the “y”
component in
the formula should be 161 and not 139. The applicant submits that there were 22
motel rooms and they should represent
one site each. He also submitted the
motel restaurant, the motel manager’s unit, the manager’s residence
and the on-site
shop should be included as sites.
applicant maintained that these additional locations use water, sewerage and
other facilities and a portion of the statutory charges
should be allocated to
applicant also maintained that a portion of the rates should be attached to the
convenience store as it is connected to town water
and sewerage.
Respondent’s submissions
respondent submitted that the applicant entered into the site agreement and
agreed to the prescribed rental formula and is bound
by it. They maintain that
the rental increase formula was applied strictly, including the inclusion of 39
sites, as defined in the
MHRP Act and the site agreement, for the
“y” component.
the park was established, 5 home sites were approved plus a tennis court and
subsequently the 5 manufactured homes on these sites
were demolished and
replaced with a 14 room motel and the tennis court was replaced with an 8 unit
motel plus restaurant and manager’s
residential unit. These 5
manufactured homes sites were still included in the “y” component of
the formula even though
the five manufactured homes on the sites were demolished
and a 22 room motel was built.
respondent also argues that the convenience store was not a site as defined in
the site agreement and the MHRP Act and the convenience
store provided a service
to the residents.
Legislation
12 of the MHRP Act provides:
12 What is a
residential park
residential park
is an area of land that includes—
(a) sites; and
(b) common areas; and
(c) facilities for the personal comfort, convenience or enjoyment of persons
residing in manufactured homes positioned on sites.”
13 of the MHRP Act provides:
13 What is a site
is land that is available for rent under a site
agreement.”

“home owner

(b) in a provision about a residential park—means a home owner for the

Observations and findings
applicant raised many issues during submissions and cross-examination, including
the history of the rental increases; who paid
the increase in costs for the
restaurant, the motel and the park; and were the home owners paying any of the
costs of the restaurant
and the motels. Ms Rezes maintained firmly that the home
owners were not responsible for the costs of these businesses. The applicant
also questioned the number of pedestals in the park and whether the council
charged for all these pedestals. It was said that the
rates notice included a
charge for 102 pedestals, even though more than this number were located at the
park, including 134 in private
motel. Ms Rezes acknowledged that some costs were shared between the motel and
the park, such as the garbage collection and the swimming pool. For the garbage
collection the costs were divided 80/20 between the
park owners and the holiday
cabins and hotels, and the swimming pool costs were divided 80/20 in favour of
the holiday cabins and
hotels as against the park owners. These formulae were
applied because of the relative use by the home owners and the holiday visitors
in the motels and holiday cabins.
issues raised by the applicant are not relevant to the one issue that has to be
decided and that is the number of sites in the
park as designated by the letter
“y” in the formula. To ascertain the number of sites at the park
requires a meaning
to be given to the expression “
the number of sites
in the park
” in the site agreement.
are two other elements in the formula that do provide a guide as to the meaning
of the expression “
the number of sites in the park
represented by the letter”y”. The letter ‘x’ represents
the increase in Local Authority charges applicable
to the park, and the letter
‘z’ represents the increase in State Land Tax applicable to the
three expressions refer to the “
”. The expression
” is not defined in the MHRP Act but in my view it is
synonymous with the expression “
residential park
” as defined
in section 12. By this section the park includes sites, common areas and
facilities for the personal comfort,
convenience or enjoyment of persons
residing in manufactured homes positioned on sites. The meaning of the
expression park is limited
to that portion of the property that has a connection
to manufactured homes, namely is limited to sites, common areas and facilities
for the personal comfort, convenience or enjoyment of persons residing in
manufactured homes positioned on sites at the park. The
private business
interests of the park owners such as the motel and restaurant would not be
included in the definition of park as
provided for in the MHRP Act and the site
my view, the convenience store, the barbeque and common areas are clearly
facilities for the comfort, convenience or enjoyment
of residents. The
manager’s residence was constructed at its location to ensure the manager
resided at the park to provide
additional security to the residents and so the
manager was available, if required, outside normal business hours. The
residence is a facility for the comfort, convenience and
enjoyment of residents even though the residents would not have free access
it. I am also satisfied the convenience shop was established for the comfort,
convenience and enjoyment of the residents. The
majority of the customers at the
shop are residents and I accept Ms Rezes’s evidence that it does not make
position with respect to the motel and the motel restaurant is different. They
are not facilities for the comfort, convenience
or enjoyment of the residents
but are commercial enterprises of the park owners. This does not mean that the
residents could not
use the motel or the restaurant but its primary function was
not for the comfort, convenience or enjoyment of residents but was for
commercial purpose
respect to expression “
the local authority charges applicable to the
” as designated by the letter “x” in the formula, it
is necessary the local authority charges be apportioned between
those charges
that are applicable to the park and those that are not. The apportionment may
have to be made with respect to water
use, sewerage use, rates, pedestal use and
other local charges.
respect to the expression “
the increase in land tax applicable to the
” as designated by the letter “z” in the formula,
again an apportionment must be made between the land tax applicable
to the park
and that which is not. As land tax is a tax assessed on the unimproved value of
the land, a calculation can readily
be made by measuring the land area that is
used for park purposes and the area that is not.
next issue concerns the meaning given to the expression “
the number of
sites at the park
” as designated by the letter “y” in the
respondent maintains there are 139 sites and these are the number of approved
sites on the property, even though the homes located
on 5 of those sites have
been demolished and replaced by a motel. To the contrary, the respondent
maintains that there are 22 motel
rooms, a manager’s residence, a
manager’s residential unit, a convenience store and each of these are and
should be described
as sites for the clause. The respondent rejects this
submission and says if all the structures of the park were included, other
structures, such as amenities blocks, on-site blocks and machine sheds should
also be included.
site is defined in section 13 of the MHRP Act as land that is available for rent
under a site agreement. By this definition, a motel
room, a restaurant is not
land available for rent under a site agreement. It follows that the 22 motel
rooms are not to be included
in the calculation of the number of sites at the
park. This definition of site does not include the locations where common
such as on-site blocks, amenity blocks and sheds are located.
this case there were 139 sites and five have been removed for the construction
of the motel. Therefore, there are 134 sites at
the park to be included in the
definition of “y”.
these circumstances I am not satisfied that the “y” component on the
formula should be 161 sites but should be 134.
application that the rental increase was excessive on the ground that the
“y” component in the rental increase formula
should be 161 sites and
not 139 sites is dismissed.
application that the site rent be reduced is dismissed.
