SOLICITORS:
Legal Services Commission for the applicant
[1] On 8 July 2008 the Tribunal made orders that:
“1. The respondent is publicly reprimanded.
respondent undertake within the next 12 months not less than 10 hours of
compulsory professional development approved by the Bar
Association of
Queensland in the areas of ethics and practice management in addition to the
compulsory professional development requirements
of the Bar Association.
LSC is directed to file and serve further submissions on the issue of a
compensation order and costs within 14 days.
respondent is to file and serve his response within 14 days of receipt of those
submissions.”
The LSC and Mr Bradshaw have filed their submissions in accordance with that
Compensation
[2] Mr L Williams, a director of Jilt Pty Ltd, a party
to proceedings in the District Court between the company and the
respondent’s
former wife, Ms Coronis, has sought an order for compensation
pursuant to
Legal Profession Act 2007
. Mr Williams has
deposed that the costs fall within two categories – the legal costs
relating to his solicitors’ assistance
in making the complaint to the
Legal Services Commission and preparing material, and the legal costs incurred
as a direct result
of the conduct of the respondent with respect to each charge.
The amounts are set out in schedules to his affidavit.
Section 464(d)
Legal Profession Act
provides that the Tribunal may order compensation
“for pecuniary loss suffered because of conduct that has been found to
be...unsatisfactory
professional conduct.” It may only do so if it is in
the interests of justice.
The LSC brought
four charges against the respondent but only one, Charge Two, the breach of r 55
of the Legal Profession (Barristers)
Rule 2004, was found to constitute
unsatisfactory professional conduct. By reference to the schedule, legal fees
associated with
perusing the impugned letter and making telephone calls was
$159. As Mr McMillan has fairly submitted, had the respondent sent the
the subject of Charge Two, directly to Mr Williams’ solicitors, thus
avoiding any ethical breach, those costs would
have been costs in the District
Court proceedings. Those proceedings are ongoing and it is likely, if
successful, that Jilt Pty
Ltd would recover that amount as part of those costs
since the letter was sent in those proceedings.
[4] Mr McMillan submits that
as a matter of public policy where a discipline application results in an
adverse finding against a practitioner,
the legal costs incurred by a
complainant in making a complaint and dealing with the Legal Services
Commission should be considered
“pecuniary loss” for the purposes of
orders for compensation under
requires the Tribunal to make an order that a person whom it
has found guilty pay costs, including costs of the commissioner and
complainant. The costs which might be encompassed in the expression
“pecuniary loss” are costs incurred by a complainant
because of the
unprofessional conduct of a legal practitioner, for example, when a costs order
was made against a complainant/client
due to the non-appearance of the
practitioner.
[5] The LSC and Mr
Williams seek the costs of the application from the respondent.
Section 462(1)
Legal Profession Act
provides that where the Tribunal has found a
respondent guilty it must make an order that the respondent pay costs
costs of the commissioner and the complainant” unless
satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist. The respondent, by his
submissions, resists an order that he should pay the costs associated with all
four charges. He also attempts to minimise
his wrongdoing in relation to Charge
Two, writing that:
“the letter [the
subject of Charge 2] was intended to be written and for the benefit of myself
and that if the tribunal accept
that then I would not have committed a breach
and that seems to be confirmed in the tribunal’s observation that it was
but not a breach.”
And later he wrote:
“The gravamente [sic] of the charge is reduced
considerably when it is accepted that I did not intend to breach the rule on
belief that it was clear that I was writing on my own behalf introducing for the
first time involving me as a potential Plaintiff
against Williams. If it had
been a blatant breach with full appreciation by myself that I was disregarding
the rule, then a different
interpretation could be placed on my
This gloss flies in the face of the express words and tone of the communication
to Mr Williams. Plainly, the respondent was writing
on behalf of Ms Coronis as
well as himself. As was found by the Tribunal, the letter was a serious breach
[6] The respondent submits that if there is to be an order for costs
then he seeks to have the amount fixed and apportioned according
to the outcome
“...and the awarding of
costs must be just and reasonable and if significant time, effort and
concentration was on matters not
substantiated then that should reduce the total
[7] In Baker v Legal Services Commissioner
McPherson JA with whom Jerrard JA and Douglas J agreed, held, with respect to
the predecessor to
“[56] In my view, however, the criterion adopted in
whether the practitioner has been found guilty of one or more of the forms of
misconduct specified in
If he has, then an order requiring him to pay
costs must be made against him unless the Tribunal is satisfied that
‘exceptional
circumstances” exist. It is true that
simply to “costs” and not to all the costs of the proceedings; but
the latter is I consider its primary meaning
in this context.
Section 286(1)
not designed to confer or preserve the broad discretion over costs commonly
found in statutory provisions conferring power to
award costs. If it had been
intended to do so, it could and would have been expressed to that effect. On
the contrary, the mandatory
rule imposed by
is designed to follow
unless the Tribunal is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist that call
for some other order to be
made, either generally or in terms of an amount under
s 286(5)(a)
or (b) or against the Commissioner under
[57] The present was not such a case. Even though he succeeded in some of
the charges against him, the practitioner was found guilty
of some seven charges
that resulted in the ultimate sanction being imposed upon him of removal from
the roll. No exceptional circumstances
existed to defeat the mandatory
requirement imposed by
that he pay the costs including those of the
Commissioner. That being so the Tribunal was required to make the order that
in this matter. In any event, if his Honour and discretion, it was or
would have been appropriately exercised by making the order
The Tribunal must, therefore, make an order requiring a person it has found
guilty to pay the costs including of the commissioner
and the complainant unless
satisfied “exceptional circumstances” exist in a case even where not
all charges have resulted
in a guilty finding.
Section 462(2)
that the Tribunal may require a person whom it has not found guilty to pay
costs, including of the commissioner and the
complainant if the Tribunal is
satisfied that the sole reason for commencing the disciplinary proceedings was
the practitioner’s
failure to co-operate or if there is some other reason
warranting the order being made. This might suggest that the legislation
not contemplate a costs order in respect of those charges if a practitioner is
otherwise found “not guilty” of certain
charges. The respondent has
not been found guilty of three of the four charges and none of them were brought
because the respondent
failed to co-operate.
[9] There is a public interest
in bringing complaints against legal practitioners to the Tribunal which has
prompted the mandatory
However, if the matter were free from
authority I would confine the costs to those associated with Charge Two. If a
charge, amongst
other charges proved, is found to be groundless and considerable
expense has been incurred to prove it, perhaps that would constitute
“exceptional circumstances”. Each of the charges here arises out of
the same sub-stratum of facts being the legal proceedings
in the District Court.
There is nothing extraordinary about the circumstances. The Tribunal is unable
to distinguish the present
case from Baker and must make a general order about
costs so far as the LSC is concerned as no amount has been proposed by the LSC.
[10] Jilt Pty Ltd, through Mr Williams, incurred considerable costs in
making the complaint to the Legal Services
Commission.
After the initial advice and
communication with the Legal Services Commission, Mr Williams could have dealt
directly with the Commission.
Section 462(5)
permits an order for costs to be
in a stated amount. Many of the itemised amounts charged by Jilt Pty
Ltd’s solicitors relating,
for example, to the solicitors’
communications with the Legal Services Commission will also be charged by the
LSC to the respondent.
Some of the items relate to perusing documents which are
associated with the litigation such as the pleadings. There is a risk
recovery, if successful in the litigation, even though these perusals are for a
different purpose. I propose to allow
a fixed sum for the costs of the
complainant in the amount of $1,155 being confined to the first four items on
the schedule. Thereafter
it was reasonable to expect the complainant to deal
directly with the Legal Services Commission.
[11] The orders
1. No order for compensation.
2. The respondent pay the
applicant’s costs of the application as agreed or to be assessed on the
standard basis.
3. The respondent pay the complainant’s costs fixed in
the sum of $1,155.
