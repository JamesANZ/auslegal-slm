RACING APPEALS TRIBUNAL
NOTICE OF DECISION
Gary Philip Whitaker
RESPONDENT:
Harness Racing Queensland
30 July 2009
APPEARANCES:
Mr Scott Neaves, Solicitor , appeared on behalf of the Appellant.
Mr Peter Callaghan SC, instructed by Mr A Harris, Schweikert Lawyers,
appeared on behalf of the Respondent
REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT
Mr Leo Williams AO – Chairman
Mr Brock Miller – Deputy Chairman
Mr Dennis Standfield – Member
In this appeal there was no transcript available because of a failure of the
recording equipment so the parties agreed a set of facts
and argued the appeal
on the strength of that and the usual exhibits found in drug testing cases.
The appeal is brought by Gary Philip Whitaker, a part time trainer and full
time harness racing driver who was convicted of a breach
of Rule 190(1) of the
Rules of Harness Racing. He presented a horse named Steelers Wheel on 4 June
2009 at the Gold Coast Harness
Racing Club meeting which returned a pre-race
blood sample positive to TC02. The Stewards held an inquiry on 22 June at Albion
and charged and convicted Whitaker for presenting a horse with a
prohibited substance in its system..
The direct evidence before the Tribunal was that the Stewards have abandoned
the practice of either heat sealing or stapling the last
of the plastic bags in
which the samples are sent for analysis. This step is required by the protocols
dealing with the collection
procedures.
The relevant step in the protocol document is Step 7 which requires that the
plastic bag containing the security pouch and samples
be sealed by heat sealer
or stapled. It seems that the Stewards have simply decided to abandon this
The Respondent tendered a letter from Dr Young of the Racing Science Centre
confirming:
I am advised that the person in charge of the licensed animal who witnessed
the taking of the samples has stated that the top of the
plastic bag was not
heat sealed or stapled as required by Step 7 of the Appendix 3 of the
Procedures.
He then goes on to detail the procedure for opening the secured bags at the
Racing Science Centre and the requirement to note in writing
any non-compliance
on the Record of Sample Custody and Dispatch document accompanying the samples.
He draws the conclusion because
there was no notation that the bag must have
been correctly sealed. He then expresses what in effect is a legal opinion as to
there has been substantial compliance with the procedures. His evidence
is at best secondary evidence of what took place and is not
determinative of the
issue. The direct evidence before the Tribunal was that the bag in question was
not stapled or heat sealed.
The Tribunal finds that the bag in question was not correctly sealed as the
direct evidence before the Tribunal establishes.
Section 352A provides:
352A Integrity of analysis of thing
(1) This section applies to any of the following decisions—
(a) a decision of a control body about taking disciplinary action relating
to a licence, which action is reliant on a relevant certificate
results of the analysis of a thing;
(b) a decision of an appeal committee on an appeal against a decision of a
control body’s steward for which the steward relied
on a relevant
certificate about the results of the analysis of a thing;
(c) a decision of the tribunal on an appeal against a decision of an appeal
committee mentioned in paragraph (b);
(d) a decision of the tribunal on an appeal against a decision of a control
body’s steward for which the steward relied on
a relevant certificate
(2) In making the decision, it is enough for the decision maker to be
satisfied that in taking and dealing with the thing for analysis,
the control
body has substantially complied with the integrity board’s procedures (the
relevant procedures
) mentioned in section 115(3) as in force at
the relevant time.
(3) In considering whether there has been substantial compliance with the
relevant procedures, the decision maker must have regard
to the evidence of an
accredited analyst, or accredited veterinary surgeon, of an accredited facility
with the relevant procedures has not
adversely affected the integrity of the analysis.
(4) In this section—
relevant certificate
means a certificate mentioned in section
In this case Mr Callaghan SC argued that the integrity of the sample was not
in any way affected by the non-compliance and evidence
was provided from Dr
Young of the Racing Science Centre to support his contention that there was or
must have been substantial compliance
as provided by the legislation.
Section 115(3) of the
charges the Racing Animal Welfare and
Integrity Board with
developing and adapting procedures about the way things for analysis are to
be taken and dealt with; and publishing the procedures
and amendments of the
procedures in a way prescribed under a regulation
The procedures described as the “Collection Procedures – Racing
Animal Welfare and Integrity Board” are contained
in the document
published pursuant to s 115(3) and effective from 1 May 2008.
Step 7 of the relevant procedure is
Place the three pocket security pouch inside the plastic bag that the sample
bottles and associated equipment were delivered in
Staple the top of the plastic bag or seal with a heat sealer if one is
The issue is not whether the sample was or was not possibly tainted or
contaminated. The control body has the benefit of statutory
provisions which
shift the onus of proof and deem a licensee to be guilty of an offence where it
is demonstrated that a horse is
presented for racing at a time when it had in
its system a prohibited substance. Sample collection procedures have been
formulated,
and custody and control procedures have also been formulated, to
ensure that the point is reached where the integrity of the sample
question. Substantial compliance will be determined on each set of facts in each
case where testing procedures are challenged.
The Stewards of their own volition have abandoned one of the steps in the
chain of custody and control and are seeking to rely on
s 352A to maintain that
the procedures are adequate to support a finding based upon the analysis of the
S 352A was not designed to provide the Stewards with a decision-making
capacity in relation to non compliance with established procedures.
The control
body has the benefit of the Rules which mandate a finding of guilt where a
positive swab is returned. However to get
to that stage it has to be shown that
the procedures have been complied with.
S 352A was intended to cover situations where there has been some
irregularity which occurs in the course of collection or testing
which is of an
involuntary nature but does not ultimately affect the integrity of the
It is the view of the Tribunal that this is not a case in which the control
body can rely on s 352A and even though it may be a small
step in the overall
scheme of custody and control it is nonetheless part of the protocol and non
compliance with it was not accidental
but deliberate. The Stewards, if they are
to rely on the strict liability of the Rule to secure convictions, do not have
to alter the protocols no matter what their opinion of the efficacy of
same. The protocols were mandated for strict compliance and
not discretionary
compliance.
The Tribunal does not accept that this case falls within the ambit of s 352A
and finds that the collection, custody and control procedures
have not been
substantially complied with, and the finding of the Stewards to convict was not
sustainable.
The appeal is allowed and the deposit ordered refunded.
