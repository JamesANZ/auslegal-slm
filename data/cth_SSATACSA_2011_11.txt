DECISION UNDER REVIEW
A Child Support Agency objection decision dated 19 April 2011. The Objections

Child Support Agency on 16 February 2011 to refuse Ms Blackburn’s
application for the fixed annual rate

The members of the Tribunal were: XXXXXXX Presiding Member
The hearing was conducted on 21 June 2011. Ms Blackburn and Mr Blackburn
spoke with the Tribunal by telephone. The Child Support Registrar
participate in the hearing.
TRIBUNAL DECISION
On 21 June 2011 the Tribunal decided to set aside the decision under review
and substitute a new decision that the fixed annual rate
does not apply, with
effect from 8 November 2010.
DATE OF DESPATCH
23 June 2011
STATEMENT OF REASONS
Child Support Agency assessed Ms Blackburn as liable to pay the fixed annual
rate of $1,193 per year to Mr Blackburn for their
son Kyle, from 8 November
2010. The assessment was based on:
Blackburn’s adjusted taxable income of $5,871 in 2009/2010 being less than
the ‘pension PP (single) maximum basic amount’
namely $14,937; and
Ms Blackburn not
having received an ‘income support payment’ in 2009/2010.
28 January 2011 Ms Blackburn made an application for the fixed annual rate not
to apply. On 16 February 2011 the Child Support
Agency refused her application.
On 23 February 2011 Ms Blackburn objected, and on 19 April 2011 her objection
was disallowed. Ms
Blackburn applied to the Tribunal for a review on 5 May 2011.
INFORMATION CONSIDERED
Tribunal has taken into account the sworn oral evidence given at the hearing by
Ms Blackburn and Mr Blackburn, as well as the
section 95(3) statement and
documents prepared by the Child Support Agency (Exhibit 1).
LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK
relevant legislation is found in the
Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989
(‘the Act’). The Tribunal will also have regard to the Child Support
(‘the Guide’) for the sake of promoting
consistency in decision-making, though the Guide is not binding. All references
below to the Guide are to 2.5.3.
is not in dispute that the fixed annual rate was correctly applied under
of the Act. A parent can apply under
section 65B
of the Act for the fixed
annual rate not to apply. The parent must establish that:
their current
income is less than the pension PP (single) maximum basic amount; and
it would be
unjust and inequitable to expect the parent to pay the fixed annual rate.
assessing a person’s current income, ‘income’ has a broad
definition under
section 65B(4)
of the Act, but as noted in the Guide the
definition is not broad enough to capture benefits such as family tax benefit
received for the benefit of children.
income such as rental income that is captured within the definition, the Guide
says that only net income is to be assessed, but
‘paper expenses’
such as depreciation, and discretionary expenses such as unnecessary repairs,
will not be deducted.
The Tribunal accepts this is appropriate.
Ordinarily,
‘current income’ is the person’s income in the period of 12
months commencing on the date of their application
for the fixed annual rate not
to apply, according to the Guide. The Tribunal regards this as appropriate in
this case, and so will
consider Ms Blackburn’s income in the period 28
January 2011 to 27 January 2012.
MS BLACKBURN’S TAXABLE INCOME IN 2009/2010
to her 2009/2010 income tax return, Ms Blackburn gave the Tribunal the following
$2,277 in wages and $10 in interest.
She derived
gross rental income of $18,700.
deductions consisted of $11,933 for interest, and $1,956 for
She had other
(non-rental) deductions of $1,227.
the Tribunal has not seen the income tax return, it accepts that these are the
figures from the return. They produce a taxable
income figure of $5,871, which
is consistent with Child Support Agency records.
MS BLACKBURN’S CURRENT INCOME
Blackburn told the Tribunal that she last had paid employment in September 2009,
and that she left work because Kyle was getting
into trouble at school. She said
that, as well as Kyle, she has a four year old daughter, and she is expecting
another child in 2011.
She does not expect to return to the workforce for quite
some time. Ms Blackburn told the Tribunal she has no income other than her
rental income, and is supported by her partner, John Plant. The Tribunal sees no
reason to doubt Ms Blackburn’s evidence about
this, or any other, aspect
of her situation.
Accordingly
the Tribunal finds that Ms Blackburn has no income other than her rental income,
and is unlikely to have any other income
in the next 12 months. She may receive
family tax benefit and baby bonus, but as these payments are for the benefit of
her children
they are not counted as income for present purposes.
Blackburn told the Tribunal the following about the rental property:
It is in her
name solely but she considers Mr Plant a part-owner because he makes up any
shortfall in expenses such as rates, and
he performs any maintenance required.
The property was
last valued about four years ago, at $360,000. She owes $170,952 on the loan.
The property is
rented for $380 per week.
The minimum
monthly repayments on the loan are $1,394. She does not know whether it is
interest-only. She fixed the interest rate
Rates are some
$370 per quarter. She has fallen behind with the rates.
Insurance for
the property is $632 per year.
Tribunal finds that the income and expenses on the property are as detailed
above. Accordingly, the gross rental income in the
period 28 January 2011 to 27
January 2012 is likely to be approximately $19,760. The interest expense is
likely to be similar to
that in 2009/2010: some $11,933. Interest is an
unavoidable expense, and so should be allowed as a deduction in assessing Ms
Blackburn’s
current income. In addition Ms Blackburn will have other
unavoidable expenses, but it can be seen that the interest deduction alone
sufficient to bring Ms Blackburn’s current income under the pension PP
(single) maximum basic amount.
is not necessary to consider whether Mr Plant may have an entitlement to any of
the income.
Accordingly
the Tribunal finds that Ms Blackburn’s current income is, and has at all
times since 8 November 2010 been, under
the pension PP (single) maximum basic
Objections Officer made no allowance for rental expenses, but as noted earlier,
the Guide indicates that generally rental expenses
are to be allowed.
the Tribunal is mindful of the requirement in
section 65B(2)
that the parent
applying for the fixed annual rate not to apply must provide evidence to support
their case. The section does not
require written evidence. The Tribunal
considers that Ms Blackburn has provided sufficient evidence orally, based on
her written
WOULD IT BE UNJUST AND INEQUITABLE TO EXPECT MS BLACKBURN TO PAY THE FIXED
ANNUAL RATE?
Blackburn is on a low income: less than $8,000 per year. She and Mr Plant live
in rented accommodation. Her only substantial asset
is her equity in the rental
property. There is no recent valuation of the property, but clearly it is a
relatively modest house.
While Ms Blackburn’s equity in the property is a
valuable asset, she could not be regarded as asset-rich by community standards.
Her position is similar to that of the many parents in the community who own
their own home subject to a mortgage. Ms Blackburn told
the Tribunal that Mr
Plant is a labourer, and they are struggling with their bills.
Guide notes that the fixed annual rate is intended to target parents whose low
taxable income does not represent their true capacity
to pay child support. For
example the person may receive goods, services or benefits – for example
from a business –
not reflected in their taxable income. The Guide
recognises that the imposition of the fixed annual rate may well be unfair for a
person on a genuinely low income who does not receive an income support payment
(such as parenting payment or newstart allowance)
because, for example, they are
not eligible. Presumably Ms Blackburn would not be eligible for an income
support payment because
of Mr Plant’s income.
the Tribunal’s view, Ms Blackburn’s circumstances are within the
and inequitable for the
fixed annual rate to apply.
Tribunal has found that Ms Blackburn’s current income is below the pension
PP (single) maximum basic amount, and that it
would be unjust and inequitable
for the fixed annual rate to apply. Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that
the fixed annual rate
does not apply.
Tribunal must specify a day, under
section 65B(5)
of the Act, from which the
fixed annual rate does not apply. The Guide suggests that ordinarily this should
be the first day in the
child support period, but that may not be appropriate if
it would cause an overpayment.
the present case, the first day of the child support period was 1 November 2010,
but it seems that Ms Blackburn became liable to
pay child support only from 8
November 2010 following a change in the care levels. Accordingly, the earliest
relevant date would
be 8 November 2010. Records in Exhibit 1 indicate that Ms
Blackburn has not been paying the assessed rate of child support, so there
not appear to be any risk that Mr Blackburn would incur an overpayment if the
Tribunal adopted the earliest possible date.
these circumstances, the Tribunal specifies 8 November 2010 as the date on which
the fixed annual rate ceases to apply.
On 21 June 2011 the Tribunal decided to set aside the decision under review
and substitute a new decision that the fixed annual rate
does not apply, with
effect from 8 November 2010.
