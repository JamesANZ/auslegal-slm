Merit Reviewer, Dispute Resolution Service
Merit Reviewer’s Reasons for Determination
is a dispute between the Claimant and QBE Australia Limited (“the
Insurer”) in respect to the calculation of weekly
payments pursuant to
Division 3.3 of the Motor Accidents Injuries Act 2017 (“the
motor accident occurred on 17 September 2019.
25 June 2020 the Insurer made a decision in respect of the payment to be made to
the Claimant assessing Pre-Accident Weekly Earnings
at $347.23. The
determination was based upon a report from Procare Forensic Services (Procare)
dated 22 June 2020.
24 July 2020 the Claimant sought an internal review of the decision.
10 August 2020 the Insurer, having conducted an internal review, affirmed the

Legislation
conducting my review, I have considered the following legislation and
guidelines:
Accident Injuries Act
(NSW) (“the Act”)
Accident Guidelines
effective 13 July 2018 (“the
Guidelines”)
Accident Injuries Regulation
(NSW) (“the
Regulation”)
to be resolved
this matter the Claimant’s earnings are complicated by a change in
earnings during the relevant period.
questions to be addressed are:
the Claimant entitled to weekly payments within the terms of Section 3.6 of the
is the method of calculating pre-accident weekly earnings?
is the calculated pre-accident weekly earnings and the benefit payable?
the Claimant entitled to weekly payments within the terms of Section 3.6 of the
entitlement to weekly payments comes from Section 3.6(1) pf the Act.
3.6(1) requires the Claimant to satisfy two elements, an “earner”
and a “loss of earnings” as a result
of the injury.
parties accepted that the Claimant was an “earner” and that there
was a “loss of earnings” as a result
of the injury.
motor accident was on 17 September 2019. The period of 2 years immediately
preceding the motor accident is from 17 September 2018
to 16 September 2019.
Claimant had been for some time undertaking work providing services, in April
2019 the nature of the Claimants work changed.
accept that the Claimant was an “earner” and there was a “loss
of earnings” as a result of the injury, this
is consistent with the
material before me
is the method of calculating pre-accident weekly earnings?
3.6(2) provides:
“A weekly payment of statutory
benefits under this section is to be at the rate of 95% of the difference
between the person's
pre-accident weekly earnings and the person's post-accident
earning capacity (if any) for the first entitlement period.”
order to make the calculation it is necessary to determine:
pre-accident weekly earnings; and
post-accident earning capacity.
parties agreed that the method of calculating statutory benefits for the first
entitlement period is in accordance with Section
3.6(2). I accept that.
parties proceeded on the basis that there was no issue in respect of
post-accident earning capacity. I accept that.
Calculation
of the statutory benefits pursuant to section 3.6(2) is determined with
reference to Pre-accident weekly earnings.
1 Clause 4(1) of the Act provides:
(1) "Pre-accident weekly
, in relation to an
is injured as a result of a
, means the weekly average of the gross earnings received by
the 12 months immediately before the day on which the
occurred, unless subclause (2) applies
1 Clause 4(1) of the Act applies unless the Claimant falls within the exceptions
set out in Clause 4(2).
Claimant asserts that one of the exceptions applies.
In the following cases,
"pre-accident

months--the weekly average of the gross earnings
received by the

employed or self-employed during a period or periods equal to at least 26 weeks
during the first year of the pre-accident period,
but was not obtaining earnings
from any source at any other time during the pre-accident period--the average
weekly gross earnings
received by the
the first year of the pre-accident period,
if subclause (3) applies--the weekly average of the gross earnings received by
the period from when the change of circumstance referred to in that subclause
occurred to immediately before the day of the
reason of having entered into an arrangement with an employer or other person to
to commence business as a self-employed person--the average weekly gross
earnings that the
reasonably have been expected to earn, but for the
that arrangement.
The "pre-accident period"

This subclause applies if, during the 12 months immediately before the day of
the motor accident, there was, as a result of any
action taken by the earner, a
significant change in his or her earnings circumstances that resulted in the
earner regularly earning,
or becoming entitled to earn, more on a weekly
basis than he or she was earning before the change occurred.
Examples of a change of circumstances to which this subclause
would apply include a change of job, a promotion, a move from part-time
full-time employment , or a pay increase arising from the achievement of
performance standards.
For the purposes of this

he or she obtains earnings from permanent
from a source that, on the day of the
, was likely to continue for a period of at least 6 months to
provide earnings to the
the same, or a similar, basis to the basis on which the earnings were being
provided as at that day.
1 Clause 4(2)(b) applies if subclause (3) applies.
1 Clause 4(3) requires:
during the 12 months immediately before the day of the motor accident,
was, as a result of any action taken by the earner, ...
significant change in his or her earnings circumstances; ...
resulted in the earner regularly earning, or becoming entitled to earn,
more on a weekly basis ...
he or she was earning before the change occurred.
is not disputed that on or about 30 April 2019 the Claimant commenced providing
services to Australian Disability Support Services.
I find that this was a
change in the earning circumstances within the terms of Schedule 1 Clause 4(3).
This is consistent with the
clause and with the Note.
find that this change occurred “
during the 12 months immediately before
the day of the motor accident”.
my view this change was “
as a result of any action taken by the
Insurer calculated the pre-accident weekly earnings for the 12 month period in
the sum of $347.23 this was contained in the report
from Procare Forensic
Services (Procare) dated 22 June 2020. The basis of this calculation was a
determination that earnings for
the 12 month period were $21,704.17. There was
an issue in relation to the income disclosed in the 2019 Tax Return, in the sum
$42,157 and amount determined by Procare. Procare accepted that the income
was “likely” to be “closer” to
the sum of $42,157 but
did not accept this amount as there was no evidence to support such work or
terms of expense Procare estimated the expenses to be incurred at the rate of
16.8% and then applied this percentage.
have accepted the Procare approach to expenses in adopting a percentage amount
as there is some degree of uncertainty surrounding
the expenses.
Claimant has, in an email dated 12 November 2020, set out the earnings from the
new contract in the period from about 30 April
2019 to 16 September 2019
calculated in the sum of $17,912.82. The period is a period of 140 days. The
email sets out 21 Invoices
that total $17,912.82.
Report from Procare in relation to the earnings from the new contract sets out
18 invoices that correspond with Bank Statements
that total $14,422.49.
five Invoices that the Claimant has included that are not included in the
Procare report being $1,178.58, $931.43, $607.38, $667.48
and $722.84. These are
invoices numbered 11, 15, 16 , 20 and 22.
two Invoices that the Procare has included that are not included in the
Claimants schedule being $566.88 and $40.50.
are 16 Invoices that correspond, total $13,805.11.
have preferred the calculation of Procare to the Claimants schedule. The Procare
assessment matched Invoices to payments creating
greater certainty of the
Procare report determined earnings of $21,704.17. It attributed earnings of
$3,350.00 to the period from 17 September 2018 to
29 April 2019. The period is
a period of 225 days. It attributed earnings of $18,354.17 (these earnings being
both from the “old”
work and the “new contract) to the period
from 30 April 2019 to 16 September 2019. The period is a period of 140
the amount determined by Procare the weekly amount from 30 April 2019 to 16
September 2019 would be ($18,354.17 divided by 140
multiplied by 7) being about
$917.71 per week (it should be noted this amount does not factor in
the amount determined by Procare the weekly amount from 17 September 2018 to 29
April 2019 would be ($3,350 divided by 225 multiplied
by 7) being about $104.22
per week ( it should be noted this amount does not factor in expenses).
accepted that the income was “likely” closer to the sum of $42,157
and accepting the amount determined by Procare
from 30 April 2019 to 16
September 2019 of $18,354.17, the amount from 17 September 2018 to 29 April 2019
would be $23,802.83 ($42,157
less $18,354.17).
the above amounts the weekly amount from 17 September 2018 to 29 April 2019
would be ($23,802.83 divided by 225 multiplied by
7) being about $740.53 per
week (it should be noted this amount does not factor in expenses).
legislation does not require me to calculate a definite amount in respect of the
Claimants earnings in the period before the “change”.
evidence available in the period from 17 September 2018 to 29 April 2019 the
Claimant was most likely earning somewhere in
the range from $104.22 per week to
$740.53 per week. Unfortunately, it is difficult to be more precise than
the evidence available in the period from 30 April 2019 to 16 September 2019 the
Claimant was earning $917.71 per week (it should
be noted this amount does not
factor in expenses).
is clear that the Claimant was earning more after the change of circumstances
than before. In my view the legislation contemplates
a comparison of gross
earnings, however, as I have accepted the percentage approach to expenses, any
deduction for expenses will
not change the outcome.
find that the change was significant for two reasons, it increased the weekly
earnings of the Claimant and it also created greater
certainty about the
Claimants earnings.
find that during the 12 months immediately before the day of the motor accident,
there was, as a result of any action taken by the
earner, a significant change
in her earnings circumstances.
find that the significant change in her earnings circumstances resulted in the
earner regularly earning, or becoming entitled to
earn, more on a weekly
basis than she was earning before the change occurred.
find that the circumstances of the Claimant satisfy the terms of Schedule 1
Clause 4(3).
find that in these the circumstances of the Claimants earnings are to be
determined pursuant to Schedule 1 Clause 4(2)(b).
4(2)(b) – the basis of the calculation
the circumstances fall within the terms of Schedule 1 Clause 4(2)(b) then the
calculation would be:
“the weekly average of the gross
earnings received by the
the period from when the change of circumstance referred to in that subclause
occurred to immediately before the day of the
find that the date of the change of circumstances was 30 April 2019.
find that the period from the change of circumstances to immediately before the
is the period
from 30 April 2019 to 16 September
the amount determined by Procare, the weekly amount from 30 April 2019 to 16
September 2019 would be ($18,354.17 divided by
140 multiplied by 7) being about
$917.71 per week (it should be noted this amount does not factor in
is a requirement for the amount be “gross earnings”.
my view there is a need to identify the meaning of both “earnings”
and “gross earnings”. The expression
” is not defined within the Act. The meaning of
“earnings” is not defined within the Act.
find that “gross earnings” includes all relevant earnings in
accordance with the Act less all business and work related
expenses but before
tax payable by the claimant. This is consistent with the view expressed by
terms of expense Procare estimated the expenses to be incurred at the rate of
16.8% and then applied this percentage.
gross earnings are then determined by deducting the expense rate to the
determined earnings, $917.71 less expenses ($917.71 multiplied
by 16.8%, being
$154.18) being $763.53.
find that the Pre-Accident Weekly Earnings are $763.53.
