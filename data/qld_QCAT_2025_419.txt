Matthew Paterson instructed by Jeremy Roberts and Courtney
REASONS FOR DECISION
21 April 2023 the Commissioner of State Revenue (‘the Commissioner’)
by its delegate refused Mr Hollands home builder
grant for the reason the
transaction (construction) for which the grant was sought was not an eligible
That was because the construction commencement date
was not on or after the contract commencement date as required.
Background and Evidence
his review application filed on 12 September 2023 Mr Holland (accepted by the
Commissioner as Luke Holland and Donna Holland
for eligibility consideration
purposes) said the decision to refuse the grant was based on a discrepancy
between the date on the
signed building contract and the first invoice (issued).
He contended having completed over $150,000.00 (the mandatory threshold
spend) of renovations within the required time period but had been rejected on a
trivial technicality namely the written contract
being dated after the
commencement of renovation works. The Commissioners assessor had ruled that the
date of the signed contract
was after the first invoice (issued) thereby making
him ineligible for a grant. Mr Holland had objected to the decision, but it was
confirmed by the Commissioner by notice of decision and statement of reasons of
21 April 2023.
[3] The First
operation of the Federal Homebuilder
Grant Scheme limited to $25,000.00 in
Queensland. Eligibility criteria for a grant were prescribed under the
“Australian Government
administrative direction (‘the Administrative Direction’).
Applicants for a grant
were required to satisfy and comply with the direction
and all eligibility criteria to receive the grant. The grant scheme for
renovations
operated in the period 4 June 2020 to 31 March 2021. The provisions
of Part 3B of the Act make it clear that the Commissioner has
no discretion to
authorise payment if the conditions of the direction are not met.
[4] By section
60(2)(a) of the Act the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal
(‘QCAT’) must hear and decide the
Commissioner’s decision by
way of a consideration of the evidence before the Commissioner when the decision
was made, unless
QCAT considers it necessary in the interests of justice to
allow new evidence. The grounds on which an application for review is
limited to the grounds of the relevant objection unless QCAT otherwise orders.
Mr Paterson referred to the decision
Commissioner of Taxation v
where it was stated
that the only pleading is the notice of objection (as here) in its original form
or as permissibly amended.
Letter from Vardy Building & Renovations Pty Ltd
Holland produced at hearing a letter from Mr Vardy of Vardy Building &
Renovations Pty Ltd (Vardy), the builder, dated
11 July 2025 in support of his
contention that the building contract had been entered into prior to
commencement of building works.
Mr Holland evinced no intention of calling Mr
Vardy as a witness. Mr Paterson objected as it constituted new evidence at
which the Commissioner had neither seen nor had opportunity to reply to
let alone cross examine the author. Procedural fairness would
adjournment, time for reply and in due course opportunity to cross examine.
[6] Mr Paterson
also objected to inclusion of the letter on the grounds of relevance. Mr
Hollands review was limited to his grounds
of objection in his email of 8
November 2022 which did not contend for any contract other than the written
contract dated 13 November
2020. Mr Hollands only ground of objection stated in
his email of 8 November 2022 was a harsh technicality. Mr Holland said he
it was an administrative error about the time the contract was signed
but asserted that “we did enter into a binding agreement
on the 27 October
and that coincides with the first invoice”.
[7] The Tribunal
determined that the builder’s letter was not admissible at hearing.
Tribunal directions of 17 April 2024 gave
Mr Holland until 6 May 2024 to file
his response to the Commissioners statement of reasons and preliminary
submissions. He did not
do so. Mr Holland never expanded his grounds of
objection in the interim fourteen months from May 2024 to July 2025. To allow
to do so now after such a lengthy period of time was unreasonable. The
Tribunal goes out of its way to ensure that situations like
this do not occur by
making directions for the filing and delivery of material/evidence well prior to
hearing thus avoiding time
wasting adjournments and costs (including cost to the
Tribunal). There was no basis here for considering it to be in the interests
justice to allow the builders email but rather prejudice to the Commissioner if
Further evidence
a letter dated 18 October 2022 Vardy stated, “This is a letter to confirm
that the renovations started at 4 James Street
West End on 27 October
[9] In cross
examination Mr Holland agreed that the renovation quote 192 and scope of works
dated 7 September 2020 provided for works
(including QBCC insurance) to a total
of $145,500.00 plus GST ($160,050.00 inclusive of GST). He agreed that a written
contract was
entered into on 13 November 2020 but said he had ‘already
entered into a binding agreement prior to that, but we signed paperwork
date”. The written contract recorded a total build/renovation price of
$144,000.00 exclusive of GST and $160,000.00
inclusive of GST.
[10] Mr Holland
agreed five instalments were paid to Vardy in respect of tax invoices pursuant
to Quote 192 dated 27 October 2020
($7,000.00), 7 November 2020 $13,200.00), 23
November 2020 ($17,569.00), 10 December 2020 $10,000.00), and 20 December 2020
($33,000.00).
An instalment tax invoice nominated as “final instalment for
renovations works at 4 James Street West End as per Quote 192”
14 January 2021was paid ($34,632.00). All instalments including the final
totalled $115,400.00 and all were inclusive of
[11] Mr Holland
agreed that the application for homebuilder grant included a question “On
what date was the renovation contract
signed” and that the answer was 13
November 2020. Mr Holland agreed the next invoice received from Vardy was on the
2022 (invoice 255). That invoice recited details of works as
“invoice includes Well Hung invoice for windows, joist and decking
front landing, trusses, QBCC insurance, licence fees and measure up for
renovations works at 4 James Street West End Qld”.
There was no reference
to quote 192. Tax invoice 258 of 28 August 2022 stated, “includes labour
and materials for renovation
works at 4 James Street West End 4814 on carport ad
front deck structure”. Tax invoice 265 of 9 October 2022 stated,
labour and materials for renovation works at 4 James Street West
End 4814 on carport and front entry.
[12] It was put
to Mr Holland that the words in Vardy’s invoice of 7 August 2022 referred
to measuring up a space before commencing
works and before ordering materials.
Mr Holland assumed Vardy would “do due diligence and remeasure”. It
was suggested
that the words in that same invoice “Well Hung invoice for
windows, joist, and decking for front landing” were not items
the original scope of works; that the original scope of works did not include
“works on the front deck” but
only to “front entry with new
stairs and balustrading as per drawing, including new front door”. Mr
Holland said there
was a front entry and then stairs and balustrade, which had
decking on it. But nowhere did the scope of works quote 192 refer to
[13] It was
suggested to Mr Holland that invoice 255 of 7 August 2022 and subsequent
invoices were given to the Commissioner because
earlier invoices (up to 14
January 2021) did not add up to $150,000.00. Mr Holland said he had an agreement
to complete the works
and that there were two stages.
Conclusions
Tribunal stands in the shoes of the Commissioner in determining the application.
It must arrive at what it considers the
correct and preferable decision. Mr
Holland (and Donna Holland) were eligible applicants for the purposes of section
25Q(3)(a) of
the Act. The Commissioner accepted that the transaction between Mr
Holland and Vardy was a substantial renovation contract, and that
Mr Holland was
the property owner.
Administrative Direction, compliance with which was mandatory, states at
paragraph one that an eligible transaction for payment
of grant includes a
renovation contract made by an owner (as here) between 4 June 2020 and 31 March
2021 and the construction commencement
date is on or after the contract
commencement date and within 18 months of the contract commencement date. Here,
according to invoices
issued pursuant to quote 192 on 27 October 2020 and 7
November 2020 totalling $20,200.00 building/renovation had been undertaken
Vardy. A formal written contract was executed on 13 November 2020 seventeen days
after “construction commencement”.
It was not disputed that the
application for homebuilder grant recorded the date of the renovation contract
as 13 November 2020.
[16] Whilst it
was contended by Mr Holland that he had “already entered into a binding
agreement prior to that, but we signed
paperwork on that date”. It is not
unusual in construction for there to be initially a scope of works as a
precursor followed
by a formal contract which becomes the document that governs
the contractual relationship between the parties. To describe the formal
contract simply as paperwork is erroneous. To the extent that construction
commenced prior to contract commencement the transaction
is not an eligible
transaction.
[17] Paragraph
four of the Administrative Direction states that “A transaction that is a
substantial renovation contract is
not an eligible transaction if the
consideration is less than $150,000.00 or more than $750,000.00. The tax
invoices issued and paid
in the period 27 October 2020 and 14 January 2021
totalled $115,400.00 inclusive of GST well below the threshold of $150,000.00
to that extent the transaction was not an eligible transaction.
[18] Whilst Mr
Holland contended that subsequent invoices commencing 7 August 2022 were really
part two of a singular contract arrangement
with Vardy doing “due
diligence and remeasure” (thus taking monetary consideration over the
$150,000.00 threshold) several
factors militate against such a conclusion.
[19] None of the
latter-day invoices commencing 7 August 2022 reference Quote 192 as did all six
invoices issued sixteen to eighteen
months prior. Invoice 255 of 7 August 2022
referred to QBCC insurance and measuring up (not remeasuring) for renovations
which are highly suggestive of, if not confirmatory of, a fresh
undertaking by both Mr Holland and Vardy. QBCC insurance is specifically
referred to as a costing inclusion on the original renovation quote and again
separately on invoice 255 of 7 August 2022. That could
of itself be construed as
compelling evidence of separate distinct contracts being entered into almost two
years apart (13 November
2020 and 7 August 2022).
[20] The invoice
of 7 August 2022 referred to “Well Hung invoice for windows joist and
decking for front landing”. Whilst
Mr Holland said there was a front entry
and then stairs and balustrade which had decking on it there was no mention of
the scope of works quote 192. If decking had been included, it would
have said so. It is reasonable to conclude that decking was
a latter-day item to
be addressed from 7 August 2022 onwards. The evidence does not reflect a
singular two stage contractual arrangement.
Holland’s only ground of objection was that stated in his email of 8
November 2022 which was that he was the subject
of a harsh technicality. The
decision of
Rowe v The Commissioner of State
was proffered to the
Tribunal as supporting the view that there was no discretion on the part of the
Commissioner to consider unfair
circumstances. Harshness was not a relevant
consideration.
$150,000.00 threshold was never reached in the grant schemes operation period or
by reference to works carried out in that
[23] For the
above reasons Mr Holland has not substantiated entitlement to a home builders
grant. The review application is refused.
The decision to refuse the Homebuilder
grant is confirmed.
