referred to in decision:
31 October 2025, the plaintiffs filed a statement of claim. The writ was issued
by the court with a notation that it was not for
service out of the jurisdiction
(Writ). This notation was required because the fourth defendant is a company
registered in Switzerland
and leave had not been sought to issue the writ
against that defendant pursuant to O 5 r 9 of the
Rules of the Supreme Court 1971
4 November 2025, the plaintiffs filed a notice of motion seeking orders for
leave to be granted for the writ to be issued for
service out of Australia to
take effect from 31 October 2025, as well as orders for substituted service
and an abridgement of time
for the time periods within which defendants are
required to file their notices of appearance.
support of the notice of motion, the plaintiffs filed an affidavit of
Jeremy Joseph Nipps, the second-named first plaintiff, on
5 November 2025, I indicated to the parties that I was minded to deal with the
application on the papers, unless the parties wished
to be heard in person.
No-one objected to this proposed course or indicated they wished to be heard on
the plaintiffs' application.
Factual background
broad factual background to the plaintiffs' claim was canvassed in my reasons
for decision in a related matter between the parties,
being CIV 1665 of
2025 (which has now been consolidated with CIV 2390 of 2024) (Consolidated
It is unnecessary for me to repeat that factual summary here. These reasons
should be read together with those reasons. I have used
the same defined terms
in these reasons.
23 October 2025, the plaintiffs issued a further direction and demand to KVI for
the provision of documents not already provided
by KVI. The plaintiffs say they
are entitled to these documents under the terms of the EPC Contract (Direction).
The plaintiffs contend
that KVI has failed to comply with the Direction in
breach of their obligations under the EPC
the plaintiffs' submission, there is a close relationship between these
proceedings and the Consolidated Action, as all matters
concern the Project and
EPC Contract. In particular, the plaintiffs highlight the fact that the relief
sought in these proceedings
is identical to that sought in their substituted
statement of claim filed 23 October 2025 in the Consolidated Action
(Statement of
plaintiffs say that it was necessary to commence these proceedings to avoid a
'potential procedural technicality' arising from
on the basis that the Direction (and any cause of action relying on an alleged
breach of the Direction) occurred after the commencement
of the Consolidated
Action. The plaintiffs have indicated they intend to seek orders for the
consolidation of these proceedings with

reaching my decision.
plaintiffs have filed a writ of summons indorsed with a statement of claim,
which I have reviewed for the purposes of this application.
The causes of action
set out in the statement of claim are sufficiently verified by Mr Nipps in
his affidavit.
the letter accompanying the application, the plaintiffs have identified the
provisions of O 10 of the Rules which their claims
fall within. These
include that the EPC Contract was to be wholly or partly performed in Australia
and is governed by the laws of
Western Australia (O 10 r 5(b)(iii) and
O 10 r 5(b)(iv)); the documents sought by the plaintiffs are located
in Australia, and, as
such, the subject matter of the claim is located in
Australia (O 10 r 5(e)); under the terms of the EPC Contract, the
fourth defendant
has irrevocably and unconditionally submitted to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts exercising jurisdiction in Western
Australia (O 10 r 5(k)); the claim is founded on a cause of action
which arises in Australia (O 10 r 5(n)); and the fourth and fifth
defendants have wrongfully detained the documents after a valid demand was made
for their return (ie, a claim for detinue) (O 10
r 5(a)(ii)). In
my view, the plaintiffs' claims in these proceedings fall within the categories
of O 10 that have been identified.
to the question as to what date these orders are to take effect from, I consider
it is appropriate to grant leave to issue
the proceedings pursuant to O 5
r 9 of the Rules.
What date should the orders take effect from?
the reasons I gave in my previous reasons for decision, I accept the court has
the power under O 2 r 1(2) of the Rules to make
the orders sought by
the plaintiffs.
the circumstances of this case, for the following reasons, I accept that it is
appropriate to make the order for leave to take
effect as of 31 October
at the time the writ was issued, I accept there was a reasonable basis for the
plaintiffs' belief that DLA Piper might accept
service on behalf of the fourth
defendant. While DLA Piper has now indicated it will accept service, I accept
there is a question
as to whether leave is still required under the Rules.
had the application been made prior to the issue of the writ, I consider that
leave would have been granted.
there does not appear to be any substantive injustice that will be suffered by
the fourth defendant if the orders sought by
the plaintiffs are

basis for the application for an abridgement of time is two‑fold: first,
the plaintiffs say these proceedings are urgent;
and second, the Consolidated
Action is listed for a strategic conference on 19 November 2025.
circumstances where these proceedings raise issues almost identical to those
that are the subject of the Consolidated Proceedings,
I consider it is
appropriate to grant the abridgement of time for the filing of appearances. The
defendants have already engaged
solicitors and counsel in the Consolidated
Action who are well versed with the issues raised by the plaintiffs. Given the
Consolidated
Action is listed for a strategic conference on 19 November
2025, I consider it would be consistent with the case management principles
out in O 1 r 4A and 4B of the Rules for this matter to be listed at
the same time. The only way that this can occur is for the
order sought by the
plaintiffs to be made.
Conclusion and orders
these reasons, I consider that leave should be granted for the writ to be issued
for service outside Australia. The time for
the defendants to file their
appearance should be abridged to 4.00 pm on 12 November 2025 and these
proceedings listed for a strategic
conference at the same time as the strategic
conference in the Consolidated Proceedings.
certify that the preceding paragraph(s) comprise the reasons for decision of the
Supreme Court of Western Australia.
