OF REFERENCE
On 15 February 2011 Simon Corbell, MLA, Attorney-General for the Australian
Capital Territory (ACT), asked LRAC to broadly inquire
into the scope and
operation of the
Discrimination Act 1991
(ACT). The Council commenced
this inquiry in February 2012, after completing its inquiry into the legal
recognition of transgender
and intersex people, LRAC 2:
Beyond the binary:
legal recognition of sex and gender diversity in the ACT.
On 19 February 2014, the Attorney-General extended the terms of reference to
consider and propose principles that could underpin complaint
and enforcement
mechanisms to promote the effectiveness of the
Discrimination Act

Ethics approval
The process for the review was approved by the Human Research Ethics
Committee at The Australian National University, and the review
was conducted in
accordance with requirements and conditions imposed by the Committee’s
THE NATURE OF THE PROPOSED
LRAC recommends a recraft of the
Discrimination Act
into a simplified
model for identifying prohibited conduct, and allowing its justification, in a
human rights-compliant manner.
The proposed model is essentially in two principal parts. The first sets out
the prohibited conduct that can be complained of (discrimination,
harassment,
vilification, offensive conduct and victimisation), the areas of life where that
conduct is prohibited, and the protected
attributes for which the conduct is
prohibited. The second part recognises that prohibited conduct can be justified
(for example,
for the enjoyment of another human right), either after the event,
as a defence, or beforehand, by way of an exemption or as a special
The process of establishing a justification or an exemption is the
‘human rights test’ of assessing whether the conduct
to be justified
or exempted is a necessary and proportionate limit on the right to
non-discrimination. This both recognises non-discrimination
‘cross-cutting right’ – a right that underpins the enjoyment
of all other rights – and allows for conduct
that is in pursuit of another
human right, such as freedom of expression or religion.
The two principal parts – setting out the circumstances of prohibited
conduct and of its possible justification – are
complemented by two
measures that expand the
Discrimination Act
from merely responding to
individual complaints to redressing systemic issues of discrimination: an
obligation to make reasonable
adjustments, and a positive duty to eliminate
discrimination.
Human rights compliant
When deciding how best to reform the
Discrimination Act
, in light of
the very different social, political, legal and economic environment since it
was enacted in 1991, LRAC has been alert
to the imperative of ensuring
consistency with the ACT’s 2004
Human Rights Act
guarantees non-discrimination subject only to reasonable limits
as defined, and the recommended reforms are designed to give effect
guarantee, while responding to the needs of a diverse society.
Building on existing
Adoption of the recommendations would put the ACT at the forefront of
legislative measures in Australia to address discrimination.
At the same time,
the recommendations reflect wide-spread practice and commentary on
anti-discrimination law. They give effect to
measures that have been implemented
in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada and the USA and to varying degrees
in other states
and territories of Australia, and to measures that have been
canvassed by expert commentators and were the subject of proposed reforms
Federal Government in 2013.
Inter-related
Few of the recommendations can be adopted in isolation; the recommendations
reflect an integrated conception of the
Discrimination Act
as a coherent
implementation of the non-discrimination guarantee in the
Human Rights
, illustrated in the figure above. For example:
• because the
Human Rights Act
allows only justifiable limits on
human rights, LRAC recommends that the
Discrimination Act
limit the right
to non-discrimination in accordance with that test for ‘justifiable
limits’, rather than by a variety
of specific and idiosyncratic
• because the provision for ‘justifiable limits’ is
available for all prohibited conduct, no specific exceptions
are made for
certain conduct, such as vilification
• the recommendation to remove specific exceptions and rely on
justifiable limits is complemented by the effective operation
of the exemption
power, so that dutybearers who might previously have relied on an exception
after the event will be able instead
to seek exemption in advance
• the effectiveness of the recommended positive duty relies on a range
of recommended powers for the ACT Human Rights Commission
• recommended amendments to the objects of the
Discrimination
are necessary both to ensure that other provisions of the Act are
interpreted in a way that is compatible with human rights, and
to align the Act
with the human rights guarantee of equal and effective protection against
discrimination.
The recommendations provide a practical framework for regulating conduct.
Regulation is, however, not without cost, and many of the
mechanisms that are
necessary to monitor and enforce the
Discrimination Act
require a public
commitment of resources, most particularly to the ACT Human Rights Commission.
Measures such as a positive duty,
the exemptions power, and the special measures
power – integral to the overall scheme of the
Discrimination Act
– will fail if the ACT Human Rights Commission does not have the resources
to give effect to them.

Human Rights Act 2004
19. Specific exceptions
Recommendation 19.1

not accepted then the
Discrimination Act
should be amended so that
exceptions that allow clubs to limit membership on the basis of race, sex and
disability be extended to
allow clubs to limit membership on the basis of any
protected attribute if the club has as its principal object the provision of
benefits to people who have that attribute.
Recommendation 19.5
If, contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence is not enacted and

qualifications’ is to be retained then:
Discrimination Act
should be amended to make a single
provision for an exception for ‘genuine occupational qualifications’
that is available
for all attributes.
Recommendation 19.7
If, contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence is not enacted and
exceptions are retained, then the
Discrimination Act
should be amended so
i. an exception for ‘inability to carry out work’ is available
for all attributes, and
ii. if Recommendations 3.1 and 3.2 concerning reasonable adjustments are not
accepted, the exception is subject to a requirement that
an employer or
prospective employer must make reasonable adjustments (having regard to an
inclusive list of considerations) to accommodate
the needs of a person who would
otherwise, because of a protected attribute, be unable to do the work.
Recommendation 19.8
If, contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence is not enacted and
exceptions are retained, then the
Discrimination Act
should be amended so
that the exception for insurance and superannuation:
i. is available only for conduct that can be justified as a reasonable limit
on the right to equal and effective protection against
discrimination, having
regard to the factors set out in
Human Rights2004
ii. is assessed by reference only to actuarial or statistical data that is
relevant to the circumstances.
Recommendation 19.9
If, contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence is not enacted and
exceptions are retained, then the
Discrimination Act
should be amended so
that the exception for domestic duties be available only for conduct that can be
justified as a reasonable limit
on the right to equal and effective protection
against discrimination, having regard to the factors set out in
Human Rights Act2004
20. Measures intended to achieve equality
Recommendation 20.1
Discrimination Act
should be amended so that the provision for
‘measures intended to achieve equality’ is not set out as an
exception to
the Act, but stands alone so that such measures are given their own
status in pursuit of the objects of the Act.
Recommendation 20.2
Discrimination Act
should be amended so that ‘measures
intended to achieve equality’ are defined in terms that are consistent
with the approach
to special measures in international human rights law, in

its publication before implementing it, but failure to notify does
any later assessment of whether the conduct has the character of a measure
intended to achieve equality.
21. Exemptions
Recommendation 21.1
Discrimination Act
should be amended so that:
i. an exemption is characterised as a justified limitation on the right to
non-discrimination
ii. in exercising the exemption power, the ACT Human Rights Commission must
have regard to the same factors that are set out in
Rights Act 2004
(ACT) to justify a limitation on a human right.
Recommendation 21.2

Recommendation 24.1
As a matter of principle, the right to equal and effective protection against
discrimination in the ACT, under the
Human Rights Act
, should not be

individuals
and to establish broad and well-resourced responsibilities for
protecting that right.
Recommendation 24.2
As a matter of principle:
i. others should be able to complain on behalf of a person who has
experienced prohibited conduct

As a matter of principle, a person complaining of prohibited conduct should
be able to elect either to make a complaint to the ACT
Human Rights Commission,
or to make an application to the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal.
Recommendation 24.5
As a matter of principle, information and documents acquired by the ACT Human
Rights Commission under its statutory power

required to show that the protected attribute or attributes alleged by the
complainant were not a reason for that treatment.
Recommendation 25.3
As a matter of principle, in response to a successful representative
complaint, ACAT should have the power to recommend that certain
action be taken,
such as monitoring by the ACT Human Rights Commission.

OF THE DISCRIMINATION ACT
The objects of an Act describe the Act’s intended effect. The objects
Discrimination Act
a. to eliminate, so far as possible, discrimination to which this Act
applies in the areas of work, education, access to premises,
the provision of
goods, services, facilities and accommodation and the activities of clubs;
b. to eliminate, so far as possible, sexual harassment in those areas; and
c. to promote recognition and acceptance within the community of the
equality of men and women; and
d. to promote recognition and acceptance within the community of the
principle of equality of opportunity for all people.
importance of statutory objects
Statutory objects have two important functions. First, they are a public
statement by the ACT Legislative Assembly of its policy objectives
in enacting a
statute, setting out for the community the values that underpin the legislation.
Secondly, they are essential to ensuring
that the statute is implemented
consistently with that policy, and consistently with human rights.
interpretation
In the ACT (as is the case throughout Australia), legislation must be
implemented in a way that is most likely to achieve its purpose
‘objects’).
Legislation Act 2001
(ACT) requires that ‘In working out the
meaning of an Act, the interpretation that would best achieve the purpose of the
is to be preferred to any other
interpretation’.
As well, the
Human Rights Act 2004
(ACT) requires that ‘So far as it is possible
to do so consistently with its purpose, a Territory law must be interpreted in
way that is compatible with human
The combined effect
Legislation Act
Human Rights Act
is that the more
closely an Act’s purpose – expressed in its objects – aligns
with human rights, the greater the
likelihood that it will be interpreted in a
way that is compatible with human rights.
The objects of the
Discrimination Act
, as a statement of the
Act’s purpose and values, are therefore an essential guide when working
out the meaning of the Act.
LRAC’s Community Consultation Paper asked
whether there should be a beneficial interpretation provision for the
Discrimination Act
which would, for example, express a legislative
intention that interpretation and implementation of the Act will promote the
objectives. Courts and tribunals have typically adopted a narrow
approach to interpreting anti-discrimination law, despite the requirements
Legislation Act 2001
(ACT) and equivalent legislation in other
The resulting
failure to promote the anti-discrimination law’s beneficial purpose may
have disadvantaged existing complainants
and discouraged potential
complainants.

on the basis that ‘this provision

the current common law principles and provisions of the ACT
Legislation
The Welfare Rights and
Legal Centre (ACT) similarly supports the inclusion of a beneficial
interpretation provision.
In LRAC’s view,
Discrimination Act
should include an
explicit beneficial interpretation clause to promote the objects of the
legislation, and to provide additional guidance
to courts, tribunals and the
community generally.
Recognition of the Human Rights Act 2004
Human Rights Act 2004
specifies that ‘everyone has the right

LRAC received a
number submissions that the objects of the Act should be amended to reflect and
promote this right to
non-discrimination.
In LRAC’s view
the objects of the
Discrimination
should be drafted to ensure that they function both as a public
statement of the
Discrimination Act
’s policy objectives and
underlying values, and as an aid to ensuring that the Act is implemented
consistently with those values
and with human rights. Further, the objects of
the Act should be amended so that they are consistent with the
non-discrimination
guarantee in the
Human Rights Act
The current objects of the
Discrimination Act
refer to the
‘principle of equality of opportunity’, which means ensuring that
the same rules apply to everyone, an approach

recognises that
it may be necessary to make adjustments, or take special measures, to address
past disadvantage and enable people
to have equal access to available
opportunities.
A number of submissions to the LRAC inquiry recommend that the objects of the
Act reflect these developments and include a commitment
to promoting substantive
People With
Disabilities ACT says that, in its experience, ‘reasonable adjustments and
special measures are necessary to address
our past disadvantage and to achieve
true equality’.
Wood proposes that the Act should refer to substantive equality, however, due to
constitutional concerns, he did not consider
that the Act could or should
recognise a ‘right’ to substantive
On this point, neither
international human rights law nor countries’ own laws promote
‘equality’ in a general sense.
Rather, equality is aspired to in
particular contexts, such as before the law, in employment, or relation to the
enjoyment of other
human rights such as access to education or participating in
public life.
One submission to the LRAC inquiry expresses concern about adopting an
objects clause which focuses only on the right to equality
nothing about the limits of the right or how it is to be balanced with other
rights’, thereby posing a ‘serious
risk that other human rights will
be violated’.
relationship between concurrent and competing rights is an important issue,
which is addressed below when considering exceptions.
In LRAC’s view
the objects of the
Discrimination
should explicitly encompass the substantive approaches to addressing
inequality.
The current objects of the
Discrimination Act
provide a snapshot of
the central policy concerns at the time it was passed, addressing equality
between men and women, and sexual
harassment. At the time the
Discrimination
was drafted, gender equality, particularly in the workplace, and the
need for women to be able to work in an environment free from
sexual harassment,
were prominent issues. These issues remain important to the ACT community.
However, since the
Discrimination Act
was drafted, other inequalities
have been identified and are the subject of attention. New areas of inequality
will continue to emerge.
Submissions to LRAC’s inquiry acknowledge the
importance of the
Discrimination Act
current objects,
however, they propose that the objects be amended to encompass existing and
emerging areas of inequality.
One submission cautions against using the gendered terms ‘men’
and ‘women’, and instead proposes that the
Act refer to
‘people of all
sexualities’.
LRAC report on legal recognition of sex and gender diverse people demonstrated
how references to ‘men and women’
or ‘male and female’
exclude people who cannot or do not identity with the gender binary.
In LRAC’s view
references in the objects of the
Discrimination Act
to specific inequalities and to promoting equality
between specific groups is no longer appropriate, as it risks excluding people
in the ACT who are entitled to have their aspirations to equality recognised.
A contemporary statement of objects is in, for example, the Victorian
Equal Opportunity Act 2010
(a) to eliminate discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation, to the
greatest possible extent;
(b) to further promote and protect the right to equal and effective
protection against discrimination set out in the
Charter of Human Rights and
Responsibilities
to encourage the identification and elimination of systemic causes
of discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation;
(d) to promote and facilitate the progressive realisation of equality, as far
as reasonably practicable, by recognising that—
(i) discrimination can cause social and economic disadvantage and that access
to opportunities is not equitably distributed throughout
(ii) equal application of a rule to different groups can have unequal results
or outcomes;
(iii) the achievement of substantive equality may require the making of
reasonable adjustments and reasonable accommodation and the
taking of special
(Considering these objects in light of LRAC’s views in this report, the
particular reference to sexual harassment in (a) and
(c) would not be
appropriate in the
Discrimination Act
. Further objects in the Victorian
Act, not set out above, relate to the functions of the relevant Commission.)
A further example is in the objects of the 2012 Exposure Draft of the
Commonwealth’s Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill,
which were:
(a) to eliminate discrimination, sexual harassment and racial vilification,
consistently with Australia’s obligations under
the human rights
instruments and [International Labour Organisation (ILO)] instruments;
(b) in conjunction with other laws, to give effect to Australia’s
obligations under the human rights instruments and the ILO
instruments;
(c) to provide for the continued existence of the Australian Human Rights
Commission as Australia’s national human rights institution;
(d) to promote recognition and respect within the community for:
(i) the principle of equality (including both formal and substantive
equality); and
(ii) the inherent dignity of all people;
(e) to recognise that achieving substantive equality may require the taking
of special measures or the making of reasonable adjustments;
(f) to enable complaints alleging unlawful conduct to be resolved in a way
that emphasises alternative dispute resolution, promotes
just outcomes for all
parties and is low-cost and accessible to all;
(g) to encourage and facilitate compliance with the Act.
(Again considering these objects in light of LRAC’s views in this

DISCRIMINATION
of discrimination: direct and indirect
Discrimination Act
currently has a two-part
definition of discrimination. Discrimination in the ACT occurs if a person:
• treats or proposes to treat the other person unfavourably because the
other person has [a protected] attribute, or
• imposes or proposes to impose [an unreasonable] condition or
requirement that has, or is likely to have, the effect of disadvantaging
because they have a [protected] attribute ...
These two parts are known as ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’
discrimination respectively, although they are not specifically
referred to in
Discrimination Act
in this way. Direct discrimination occurs when a
person is treated unfavourably because they have a protected attribute. For
it is direct discrimination in employment when an employer refuses to
employ a young woman because she may go on maternity leave
at some stage.
discrimination occurs when someone imposes an unreasonable
condition or requirement which disadvantages a person because they have
protected attribute. For example, it is indirect discrimination in provision of
services if the only way to enter a public building
is by a set of stairs,
because this is a requirement for entry that applies to everyone but will
disadvantage, for example, people
confined to wheelchairs.
The distinction between direct and indirect discrimination is important to
illustrate the different ways that discrimination can occur.
Popular ideas of
discrimination tend to the obvious unequal treatment – sometimes outright
prejudice – that is direct
discrimination. It is often harder to identify
indirect discrimination, when a requirement or condition applies to everyone but
an unfavourable impact on some people. By distinguishing between direct and
indirect discrimination, attention can be drawn to the
less obvious ways in
which discrimination can occur.
Another more technical reason for maintaining the distinction has been
because courts have decided that, because of the way that anti-discrimination
laws are drafted, these two characterisations of discriminatory conduct are
mutually exclusive and conduct that is complained of
has to be identified as
either direct or indirect
discrimination.
But the distinction between direct and indirect discrimination can be
conceptually difficult for people who want to complain about
discrimination, and
for people who are trying to comply with the Act and avoid discriminating. This
confusion sometimes means, for
example, that complaints are made about both
the tribunal. This adds to the complexity of the complaints procedure and any
subsequent tribunal hearing.
In its submission relating to the Exposure Draft of the Commonwealth’s
Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill, the Discrimination
Law Experts’
Group said, ‘the distinction between direct and indirect discrimination
has shown itself not to be workable.
It is a costly and time-consuming technical
barrier to an inquiry into what actually

non-discrimination with the fundamental right to freedom of
One approach to addressing the difficulty of distinguishing between direct
and indirect discrimination would be to have a single definition
discrimination which clearly encompasses both types of discrimination. This
approach is taken in Canada,
is supported by a number of submissions to the LRAC
For example, ADACAS
explains that its clients are ‘often subject to more generalised
discrimination from a wide section of
society’ and the
Discrimination
‘should be amended in such a way that the term
‘discrimination’ is defined as broadly as
People With
Disabilities ACT similarly supports this approach, on the basis that
‘[t]his would simplify the framing and
presentation of complaints and make the
Discrimination Act
understand’.
response to the Attorney-General’s Department’s discussion paper on
the consolidation of Commonwealth anti-discrimination
laws, the Discrimination
Law Experts’ Group said:
A single definition will ease the regulatory burden and will assist
understanding and compliance. As well as making compliance easier,
definition of discrimination will more closely align Australia with
internationally recognised definitions of discrimination,
better fulfilling our
international human rights treaty obligations. Such an approach is similar to s
9(1) of the [Commonwealth]
Discrimination Act
and reflects the
current approach in Canada, New Zealand and the USA, which makes no formal
definitional distinction between direct
and indirect
discrimination.
Another approach would be to accompany the existing definitions in
with an express statement that claims of direct and indirect discrimination are
not mutually exclusive. This approach was taken in
the Exposure Draft of the
Commonwealth’s Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill, and is
recommended in one of the submissions
to the LRAC
The ACT Human Rights
Commission also expresses a preference for retaining ‘both direct and
indirect discrimination based on
unfavourable (not less favourable)
treatment’, due to the ‘practical challenge’ of introducing a
single definition
of discrimination.
A further alternative is to remove all references to discrimination, and
instead refer to the two types of prohibited conduct as ‘unequal
treatment’ and ‘unequal impact’. This is the approach taken in
the United States of America,
and reflects a concern that the word ‘discrimination’ may no longer
be as effective as it was in conveying a sense of
undesirable social conduct.
In its report on recommendations for a consolidated federal
anti-discrimination law in Australia the Discrimination Law Experts’
recommended a definition based on the
International Labour Organization
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against
Relevantly to the
right of non-discrimination in the ACT
Human Rights Act
, such a definition is
consistent with international human rights law. The definition recognises the
two types of discrimination,
but in a single definition and not in a mutually
exclusive manner. Further, the Experts’ Group recommended that
discrimination
should be said to occur when what is done has
‘purpose or effect’ provided that the discriminatory purpose
or effect is substantial, and that, for consistency with
current case law, it
should also make clear that the respondent’s
intention as to or
awareness of
the discriminatory purpose or effect is not a relevant
consideration.
On this latter point, section 10 of the Victorian
Equal Opportunity
, for example, says (for a differently defined concept of discrimination)
that, ‘[i]n determining whether or not a person discriminates,
person's motive is irrelevant’, although that is the wellaccepted position
in case law.
In LRAC’s view,
the preferable means of reducing the confusion
surrounding the concepts of ‘direct’ and ‘indirect
discrimination’
is to adopt a definition of discrimination which makes it
clear that these two ways of understanding discrimination are not mutually
exclusive. However, while acknowledging the benefits of adopting a single
definition of discrimination, LRAC considers that express
references to
‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ discrimination perform an
important educative function about the different
preferable way to define discrimination is based on the approach taken by the
Discrimination Law Experts’
Group, explicitly identifying conduct as
‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ discrimination’.
Discrimination would therefore be defined as conduct that occurs directly,
indirectly, or both directly and indirectly, where discrimination
that occurs
directly is unfavourable treatment as currently defined in the
Discrimination
, and discrimination that occurs indirectly is the imposition of a
condition or requirement or practice as currently defined in the
Discrimination Act
for discrimination
The ACT, like Victoria, uses a ‘detriment’ test for direct
discrimination, which means that discrimination occurs when
a person is treated
unfavourably because of their protected attribute. To succeed, a complainant
must demonstrate that (1) they experienced
unfavourable treatment which caused
detriment, and (2) that the treatment was because of their protected attribute.
By contrast,
most State and Commonwealth anti-discrimination legislation uses a
comparator test,
under which
discrimination occurs when a person with a protected attribute is treated
favourably than another person without that protected attribute was
or would have been treated. To succeed, a complainant must demonstrate
they experienced treatment which caused detriment, (2) the treatment was less
favourable than the treatment of a real or
hypothetical other person without
that protected attribute in the same circumstances, and (3) that the
differential treatment was
because of their protected attribute.
LRAC’s inquiry received submissions expressing differing views on the
test that should be used in the ACT. Women with Disabilities
ACT supports the
current approach and submits that the comparator test should not be adopted
under the Act.
It provides
examples of circumstances in which the comparator test would provide ‘an
impossible evidentiary burden on women
with a disability’ and considers
that while ‘[a] comparator might be an indicator of unlawful
discrimination...it is
neither necessary nor

Freedom 4 Faith submits that ‘the insertion of a comparator will ensure
greater objectivity’.
The difficulties imposed by the comparator test are well

Purvis v New South Wales (Department

On the other hand, there has been no concern expressed in the ACT about the
operation of the ‘unfavourable treatment’
test, or in Victoria since
the test was adopted there in 2010. The Exposure Draft of the
Commonwealth’s Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination
Bill used the
‘unfavourable treatment’ test.

defines discrimination by reference to
‘an attribute’, and does not explicitly recognise that
discrimination may occur

difficult or inaccurate to try to ascribe to a single attribute the reason for
conduct, or the reason for suffering the effect
of a requirement. The options
for a complainant are to make one complaint based on one attribute, or to make
multiple complaints.
For example, a person may not be able to tell whether the
discriminatory conduct they experienced was because of their age, or their
disability, or some combination of the two. Although the ACT Human Rights
Commission usually accepts and conciliates a complaint
that identifies multiple
possible attributes to explain discriminatory conduct, a complaint that proceeds

of a woman with a disability who
was discriminated against in her parenting role
on the grounds of both her disability and her sex, and observes that ‘many
older people experience discrimination in circumstances in which it is difficult
to determine whether the discrimination is due to
their age or their
disability’. Welfare Rights and Legal Centre (ACT) provides a similar
The Multicultural Health Policy Unit, ACT Health, draws attention to the
experiences of people from culturally and linguistically

backgrounds. It explains that ‘[p]eople from CALD backgrounds may not be
able to tell whether discriminatory
conduct they may experience was because of
their race, religious affiliation, immigration status (if included ...), or a
combination
of these and related attributes’.
In relation to older people, COTA ACT notes that that ‘a person may,
for instance, be discriminated against because of any one
(or more than one) of
a number of protected characteristics, such as age, disability (which often
accompanies ageing), sex, having
carer responsibilities (also a common
characteristic of mature age), and certain physical characteristics (such as an
older appearance,
grey hair, etc)’. COTA ACT considers that ‘[t]o
require a complainant to pick just one aspect is unreasonable, as they
can’t be expected to guess the motivations of the discriminator (which may
not be based on a single characteristic either)’.
In the Exposure Draft of the Commonwealth’s Human Rights and
Anti-Discrimination Bill, discrimination was defined to cover ‘a
particular protected attribute, or a particular combination of 2 or more
protected attributes’. Similarly, in Canada, discrimination

to make reasonable adjustments
Discrimination
and other Australian
anti-discrimination laws,
a person has a defence to a disability discrimination complaint if they can
show that it would have caused them unjustifiable hardship
to do what was
necessary to enable a person with a disability to do any of: carry out work;
access premises, accommodation, facilities
and education; receive goods and
services; or enjoy the benefits of club membership. Enabling a person with a
disability in this
way is commonly referred to as ‘making reasonable
adjustments’.
There is currently no explicit obligation in the
Discrimination Act
make reasonable adjustments, although it has been suggested in the ACT that such
an obligation could be implied.
Making reasonable adjustments is referred to only in the context of a defence to
a disability complaint, when doing so would cause
unjustifiable hardship thereby
excusing discriminatory conduct. It has commonly been inferred from the
existence of this defence
that there is actually a duty to make reasonable
adjustments, but this inference was doubted by the High Court in the decision of
In response to
the High Court’s comments, and on the recommendation of the Productivity
Commission,
the Commonwealth
Discrimination Act
was amended so that making reasonable adjustments
is now an express duty under that Act, and unjustifiable hardship is an
to that duty; a similar duty exists in the Victorian
Opportunity Act
Any claimed unjustifiable hardship in making reasonable adjustments is
assessed taking into account the nature of the disability,
the cost of making
the adjustment(s), the likely benefit or detriment for all people concerned, and
the financial circumstances of
the person claiming unjustifiable hardship.
An express duty?
Rather than relying on an implied duty to make reasonable adjustments, the
Discrimination Act
could be amended to take the same approach as that in
the Commonwealth
Discrimination Act
the Victorian
Opportunity Act
, and in the Exposure Draft of the Commonwealth Human Rights
and Anti-Discrimination Bill.
Submissions to LRAC on this issue support a positive duty to make reasonable
adjustments to redress a power imbalance between employers
or service providers
and people with protected attributes. For example, People with Disabilities ACT
notes that a duty to make reasonable
adjustments ‘recognises in most
situations employers and service providers are in a more powerful position than
a person with
a disability and are better placed than the person with a
disability to take the action which would turn a potential situation of
discrimination into one of non-discrimination’. In its view, ‘[t]his
would reduce discrimination and reduce the need
for people with disabilities to
make discrimination
complaints’.
ADACAS submits that, in some cases, people with disabilities are
‘effectively excluded from society’, due
to ‘the failure of
others to include them or make reasonable adjustments to cater for their

COTA ACT agrees that
the law should include a duty to make reasonable
adjustments.
An example of a
reasonable adjustment for a person with a disability in a workplace is when an
employer provides a visually impaired
employee with screen-reading software.
The ACT Human Rights Commission submits that an explicit duty to make
reasonable adjustments would ‘bring greater certainty
and clarity to this
issue, and would harmonise ACT discrimination law with Commonwealth

equality and with Australia’s obligations under the UN

Social model of disability
Although LRAC recommends below that a duty to make reasonable adjustments be
available in relation to all protected attributes, a
particular reason for such
a duty in relation to the attribute of disability is that it gives effect to a
social model of disability.
On this model, a disability is understood to exist
not because of a medical diagnosis, but ‘when a person’s impairment
interacts with societal barriers in a society that has not been designed to
accommodate the access needs of people with
impairments’.

In LRAC’s view
, it is desirable to
create an explicit,
general duty to make reasonable adjustments. To do so would be consistent with a
commitment to substantive equality
and with the majority of submissions received
on this issue.

, the reasonableness of an adjustment is decided having regard to
‘all relevant facts and circumstances’, including factors
the person's
circumstances and the nature of their disability; the nature of the required
adjustment; the financial circumstances of the employer
or service provider and
the effects on the service provider of making the adjustment; the number of
people who would benefit from
or be disadvantaged by the adjustment; and the
consequences for the employer or service provider and the person of making the
adjustment.
The ACT Human Rights Commission, and People With Disabilities ACT, support an
approach to reasonableness based on the Victorian
Equal Opportunity Act
which lists a variety of factors to be taken into account when assessing the
reasonableness of adjustments.
They do, however, recommend some modifications to the list of factors to be
considered. For example, the Commission notes that under
the Victorian
Opportunity Act
, an education authority is not required to make reasonable
adjustment if they are complying with the Federal Disability Standards
Education, a provision intended to address the potential for a direct
operational inconsistency between the federal standard
and the state obligation.
As a matter of principle, the Commission considers that a harmonised approach
between the Commonwealth and State and Territories ‘is
both appropriate
and desirable’,
concerned that the Standards have been ‘interpreted in a restrictive
manner, and one that is inappropriate for the ACT
when taking into account the
ACT’s status as a human rights jurisdiction with an explicit right to
education’. On this
basis, it submits that ‘the Federal Standards be
used as a component or factor to be taken into account when assessing the
reasonableness of adjustments, rather than used as a complete
People With Disabilities ACT also supports the approach taken in the
Equal Opportunity Act
, although it considers that the
person’s specific disability ‘is irrelevant to this
assessment’ because such an
approach ‘resort[s] to the medical model
of disability which is contrary to the human rights approach of the
It submits that
‘[t]he assessment should focus on the access barriers and the required
adjustments and not on the person’s
disability’. It also recommends
‘that the assessment should include the consequences of not making the
adjustment or
accommodation as well as the consequences of doing
In LRAC’s view
, the assessment of reasonableness should be
modelled on the approach taken by the Victorian
Equal Opportunity Act
subject to the refinements suggested by the ACT Human Rights Commission and
People With Disabilities ACT.
Scope of the duty
There are attributes other than disability on the basis of which a person is
excluded from, or has limited access to, work, goods,
services, accommodation
and so on, such as a person’s age, sex and carer’s responsibilities.
Discrimination Act
could require reasonable adjustments to be made to
accommodate the needs of people with these other attributes.
An example of making reasonable adjustments for people with attributes other
than disability is in a workplace where the first language
of many employees is
Arabic, but written workplace health and safety (WHS) instructions are provided
to employees only in English;
a reasonable adjustment would be for the employer
to provide a version of the written WHS instructions in Arabic. Another example
is a workplace where promotion to a particular position requires a specified
minimum years of unbroken service; a reasonable adjustment
would be to allow a
candidate who did not meet the service requirement because they are young, or
have taken parental leave, to rely
on other means to establish their ability to
perform in the higher position.
A number of submissions to the LRAC inquiry support the inclusion of a
general duty to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate
the needs of a person
based on other attributes.
ACT Human Rights Commission supports such a provision ‘in the interests of
substantive equality’, and considers that
the duty should be placed on
employers and ACT Public Authorities.
The Commission supports an approach in which the employer is required to
make a reasonable adjustment for a person, irrespective of
the person’s
attribute, ‘to determine whether they can carry out the essential nature
of the work’, and recognises
the merit in applying this exception to all
attributes.
This proposal is
supported by Dr Asmi Wood
The Multicultural Health Policy Unit, ACT Health, also submits that such a
duty would be ‘in line with the concept of substantive
and suggests that consideration be given to amending the Act to include a duty
to make reasonable adjustments to
accommodate the needs of people with low
English proficiency (written or oral) when providing essential services.
This suggestion accords with a
confidential submission made to LRAC, which highlights the discrimination
experienced by people with
low English proficiency in the context of the
provision of health care
Both the ACT Human Rights Commission and the Women’s Legal Centre (ACT
and Region) highlight ‘the value of imposing a
positive duty in relation
to accommodating the needs of people based on their family and caring
responsibilities’.
Women’s Legal Centre (ACT and Region) prefers an approach which imposes
‘a positive duty that an employer is required
to make reasonable
adjustments to accommodate a person who would otherwise be unable to do the
In its experience,
‘the current exception is often relied upon to terminate a person’s
employment, without adequate consideration
of reasonable adjustments’. The
Centre provides two case studies to demonstrate how such a duty would promote
the efficient
resolution of workplace disputes, by increasing ‘the number
and quality of negotiated outcomes’, and by promoting a systemic
‘change in ACT workplace culture to recognise the importance of providing
flexible work arrangements for all
employees’.
COTA ACT supports the inclusion of an express duty to make reasonable
adjustments to accommodate the needs of a person based on other
attributes. It
notes, however, that that the word ‘reasonable’ is open to wide
interpretation, and suggests that ‘[t]he
duty to make reasonable
adjustments should not be onerous enough to influence an employer not to employ
(or not to continue to employ)
a person who requires ‘adjustments’
(it is difficult enough for older people and people with disabilities to obtain
maintain employment already)’. It says that ‘[i]deally,
assistance should be available, particularly for small employers,
when they are
required to make such
adjustments’.
Dr Asmi Wood
similarly considers that a duty to make reasonable adjustments should take into
account the subjective circumstances
of the party. For example, he considers
that the duty should be less onerous for small business.
In LRAC’s view
, creating an enforceable duty to make adjustments
in relation to other attributes would broaden the scope of the existing law in
positive way, in that it would encourage reasonable steps to be taken to enhance
access for a much wider range of people to areas
such as work, goods, services
and accommodation.

below. These other forms of prohibited
conduct are covered in separate parts of
Discrimination Act
, and only apply to limited grounds (sexual
harassment, and vilification on the basis of race, sexuality, gender identity
and HIV/AIDS
status). Harassment can be said to be direct discrimination
(unfavourable treatment because of a protected attribute), but the
Discrimination Act
does not explicitly prohibit harassment on the basis
of, say, age or disability. Nor does it explicitly prohibit vilification on the
basis of, say, disability or sex.
Rather than the current approach of dealing with
‘discrimination’

‘vilification’ separately, it is possible to include all these forms
of prohibited conduct
in the same part of the
Discrimination Act
all prohibited conduct is applicable to all the attributes. A recommendation is
made below that a category of prohibited
conduct be identified as
‘offensive conduct’, and that too would be included as a form of
prohibited conduct.
On this approach, each form of prohibited conduct would be defined
separately, making clear that each is conceptually different, although
This is similar to the approach taken in the Exposure draft of Commonwealth
Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill, and
in the Tasmanian and the Northern
Territory anti-discrimination

In his submission
not the LRAC inquiry, Dr Asmi Wood notes that harassment and vilification are
quite broad terms, and drafters should

notes that ‘[h]arassment on the basis of age (including disrespectful
language and conduct) is not uncommon in, for
instance, employment situations,
and should be treated in the same way as racial

In LRAC’s view,
the inclusion of harassment, offensive conduct

discrimination would simplify the structure of the Act, making clear the conduct
that is prohibited by the Act, and making it
more straightforward to cover
conduct relating to other attributes, such as age-based harassment or disability

would be available for all types of prohibited conduct. The specific definitions
of harassment,
offensive conduct and vilification are discussed below.

POSITIVE DUTY
Australian anti-discrimination laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of
certain personal attributes. In this way, the laws are
‘negative’ because they require a person ‘not to
discriminate’. Like most discrimination laws, the approach
in the ACT is
complaints-based, and relies on a person making a complaint of discrimination to
the ACT Human Rights Commission. If
the Commission is unable to resolve the
complaint through conciliation, the person may make a claim in ACAT. The
complaints process,
with its emphasis on early conciliation and resolution when
possible, can work well and achieve a result that satisfies the person
complained. But the time, cost, process and stress can be a burden, particularly
when conciliation does not lead to resolution
and operate as a disincentive. A
further consideration is that individual complaints offer individual redress and
are not a mechanism
for addressing systemic discriminatory practices.
An alternative to a reactive approach to discriminatory conduct is to
encourage positive, pre-emptive action that will avoid or reduce
the incidence
of discrimination. A positive duty shares responsibility for giving effect to
anti-discrimination law between an individual
who complains about
discrimination, and people and organisations who have a duty to not discriminate
in the first place. There is,
in fact, a positive ‘human rights’

A positive duty to eliminate discrimination, and/or to promote equality (it
is expressed in different terms, discussed further below),
exists in a number of
countries, including the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and
The United Kingdom, for
example, imposes a ‘public sector equality duty’ on public bodies in
relation to the attributes
of age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy
and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. The United
Kingdom provides detailed legislative guidance on how to carry out those duties,
for example, through auditing practices that identify
specific barriers.
In Victoria, after a recommendation from the Equal Opportunity Review, the
Equal Opportunity Act
imposes a positive duty on public bodies
and businesses to ‘take reasonable and proportionate measures to eliminate
discrimination,
sexual harassment or victimisation as far as
The measures
that are required depend on factors such as the organisation’s size,
resources and circumstances, and are monitored
by the Victorian
Commission.
The Victorian
Equal Opportunity Act
gives these examples:
• a small, not-for-profit community organisation takes steps to ensure
that its staff are aware of the organisation's commitment
to treating staff with
dignity, fairness and respect and makes a clear statement about how complaints
from staff will be managed.
• a large company undertakes an assessment of its compliance with the
Equal Opportunity Act
. As a result of the assessment, the company
develops a compliance strategy that includes regular monitoring and provides for
improvement of the strategy.
A positive duty is usually spoken of, in international experience,
legislation and submissions, as one that either promotes equality
or prevents
discrimination. These are two different desired outcomes, conceptually and
practically. Discrimination and its prevention
have a reasonably clear and
defined meaning, in Australian law and internationally. Equality, on the other
hand, can encompass non-discrimination,
but can refer as well to aims such as
equality of treatment, equality of opportunity, and equality of outcomes.
Some submissions to LRAC are understandably wary of uncertainty relating to
the meaning that can be given to equality. Freedom 4 Faith,
for example, submits
that it is ‘hard to know what it [a positive duty] means in
practice’, due to the conceptual ambiguity
associated with the concept of
The ACT Bar
Association supports a positive duty ‘to take reasonable steps to prevent
unlawful discrimination’,
distinguishing between a duty to prevent discrimination and a duty to promote
It is significant that the duty in the Victorian
Equal Opportunity Act
relates not to promoting equality but to eliminating discrimination, and that is
the approach that LRAC proposes.
Submissions to the LRAC inquiry address these questions: whether the
Discrimination Act
should include a positive duty and, if so, to whom the
duty should apply, what it should require, and who should be responsible for
monitoring compliance.
A positive duty?
The majority of submissions to LRAC support amending the

provides an example of how the positive duty would work in practice, by
requiring duty-holders ‘to assess

procedures on equality of opportunity at the outset rather than waiting for a
complaint to be made,
Welfare Rights and Legal Centre provides a case study in which a positive duty
would have enabled the resolution of a complaint
at an earlier stage and without
the need for their client ‘to go through the stress of another
complaint’.
Multicultural Health Policy Unit, ACT Health, submits that the introduction of a
positive duty ‘is preferable to placing
responsibility on people with low
English proficiency to demand such resources, or make complaints if such
resources are not
available’,
adding that
‘[t]he inclusion of a positive duty could reduce the number of
complaints’.
Dr Asmi Wood considers that a positive duty should not be introduced, on the
basis that it might create unrealistic expectations and
doesn’t take into
account the constraints of federalism. As an alternative, he suggested that an
aspirational statement might
Freedom 4 Faith submits that a positive duty ‘is problematic because it
suggests that some rights should trump other rights’,
which ‘goes
against the long standing premise of human rights law that there is no hierarchy
of human rights’. LRAC notes
that the position in international law is
that the right to non-discrimination is a ‘cross-cutting right’, a
underpins the enjoyment of all other rights; the ACT
Human Rights
, for example, guarantees everyone the right to enjoy their human rights
‘without distinction or discrimination of any kind’.
A duty to promote non-discrimination
gives effect to the ACT’s obligation to ensure that that is the case.
In LRAC’s view,
introducing a positive duty to eliminate
discrimination would lessen the burden on individual complainants who may lack
the capacity
to make and pursue a complaint, but are nonetheless vulnerable to
discrimination. It would also promote consistency between the
Discrimination
Human Rights Act
, which guarantees everyone the right to
enjoy their human rights without discrimination.
A sufficiently prescriptive duty, supported by guidelines and implemented in
stages, (discussed below) would, in LRAC’s view,
address concerns that a
positive duty would be insufficiently clear for duty holders, particularly as
the duty would be to eliminate
discrimination, not to promote equality. Further,
in LRAC’s view, the recommended inclusion of a justification defence, and
the availability of an exemption, would ensure that other rights in the
are adequately recognised.
The potential cost to business is likely to be minimal, due to existing
policies and training programs that would encompass these
obligations. The
overall effect is likely to be a reduction in the incidence of discrimination.
The potential scope of the duty,
including to whom it should attach, is
considered below.

In LRAC’s view,
the positive duty to eliminate discrimination
should, at first instance, apply to Public Authorities. As noted by the ACT
Human Rights
Commission, this would be consistent with the existing obligation
on public authorities, under
Human Rights Act
, to act in a
way that is consistent with human rights and to give proper consideration to
human rights. The duty should then be extended
to private sector bodies and
community organisations, with sufficient resources allocated to providing these
bodies with education
and training about the requirements of the duty in advance
of their becoming subject to it. Duty holders should be supported by training,
and the publication of guidelines and case studies by the ACT Human Rights
Commission, which would need to be sufficiently funded
for this purpose.
Monitoring compliance
The effectiveness of a duty to eliminate discrimination will depend on the
effectiveness of the compliance mechanisms. The ACT Human
Rights Commission
submits that ‘[t]o ensure the success of such a measure, resources of the
kind used by Fair Work Australia
would be required, to educate the public about
anti-discrimination obligations’.
Similarly the Women’s
Legal Centre (ACT and Region) is concerned to ensure that if a positive duty is
introduced, the ‘Commission

monitor the performance of Public Authorities in relation to any new
The Fair Work Ombudsman’s
Guidance Note 6, Discrimination
, is a useful guide as to the regulatory powers that can be used to
eliminate discrimination. A range of measures includes workplace
inspectors’ powers to enter workplaces, seek evidence, interview people
and require production of documents; caution
notices; enforceable undertakings;
proceedings for breach; and the imposition of civil penalties. Similar powers,
including the
power to conduct public inquiries, were included in the Victorian

government in 2011. The Labor government elected in 2015 has undertaken to

OF DISCRIMINATION
Discrimination Act
prohibits discrimination based on protected
attributes in certain areas of public life, such as work, education, access to
goods, services and facilities, accommodation, clubs, requests for
information, and advertising. A person making a complaint is required
that an act of unlawful discrimination occurred in one of these specific areas.
The coverage of these prescribed areas is
exhaustive: if conduct is not within
one of these specific areas, it is not covered by the
Discrimination
Discrimination Act
makes exceptions that allow discrimination in
some of the prescribed areas because if the conduct occurs in certain areas of
life, such as employment for domestic duties, residential care of
children, and providing domestic
accommodation.
This carves
out ‘private’ areas from the more general ‘public’ areas
that are covered by the Act.
Areas of public life
An alternative approach is to prohibit discrimination that is connected with
any area of public life, and to provide an exception
for private conduct. Under
this approach, a person making a complaint would not need to show that an act of
discrimination occurred
in a specific area of life. Instead, there would be a
presumption of coverage under the
Discrimination Act
, but one that would
not apply if the conduct occurred in a private context. This is the approach
taken in the Commonwealth
Discrimination Act
, under the Victorian
Racial and Religious Tolerance Act
, and under the Queensland
Discrimination Act
for sexual harassment. It was also the approach that was
taken for discrimination generally in the Exposure Draft of the Commonwealth
Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill.
The majority of submissions to LRAC support prohibiting discrimination in all
areas of life with an exception for private
The ACT Human Rights
Commission cites the recent VCAT decision of
Bakopoulos v Greek Orthodox
Parish of Mildura (Human
as an example of
why this approach is preferable. In that case, a woman was denied financial
membership of a Parish Committee and
claimed that she had been discriminated
against on the basis of her sex, but the Tribunal found that the conduct did not
fall within
any of the areas in which discrimination is prohibited by the
Equal Opportunity Act
. The Commission comments, without elaboration, that
‘there may need to be further consideration about the extent of this new
coverage, and whether exceptions need to be revisited’.
COTA ACT also supports prohibiting discrimination in all areas of public
life, noting that ‘[a]ged care is an area where discrimination
(anecdotally) occur based on, for instance, gender identity or intersex status,
and this should be prohibited within the Act,
where it occurs in aged care
facilities or in home-based aged care
A further example is in the provision of government services. Although they
are covered to an extent under the area of ‘goods,
services or
facilities’, this coverage can sometimes be unclear, because carrying out
a government ‘function’ does
not necessarily involve providing a
service. A police officer is not obviously providing a service to someone whom
they arrest, although
they may then be providing a service to the same person
once the person is in
It may be considered
anomalous that a government that promotes non-discrimination in the community is
able to discriminate in its
own operations.
Another example is the conduct of a competition, such as a talent quest or
film festival. It is unlikely that the conduct of a competition
is the provision
of goods, services or facilities, or that the participants are involved in work.
Although the conduct of a competition
can be as public in nature as an
employment relationship, or more so, organisers seem to be not covered by the
Discrimination Act
People With Disabilities ACT expresses ‘cautious’ support for an
amendment to prohibit discrimination in all areas of
life with an exception for
private conduct, noting that this approach ‘is the approach taken to the
criminal law and other
laws and has worked practically in the area of race
discrimination’.
Conversely the Australian Christian Lobby and Freedom 4 Faith consider that
prohibiting discrimination in all areas of public life
would leave the Act
‘dangerously
open-ended’,
‘create significant uncertainties in determining where the distinction
between public and private life should
In Freedom 4 Faith’s view, leaving the courts to determine the
boundaries between public and private on a case by case basis
appropriate alternative, because ‘the law needs to be
comprehensible’. Further, it considers that such a requirement
impose ‘unreasonable burdens on small business and non-profit
organisations to seek legal advice which may, in any event,
be tentative and
qualified’.
In LRAC’s view
the current scope of the coverage provided by
areas specified under the
Discrimination Act
is inconsistent and
uncertain, and this has led to uncertainty about when discrimination is
unlawful. Submissions offered examples,
noted above. LRAC considers that the Act
should be amended to prohibit discrimination in all areas of public life. This
would reflect
the objectives of the Act to eliminate discrimination and promote
consistency with the right to non-discrimination in the
Human Rights Act
Such an amendment would make it clearer to people when the Act applies, and
excluding private conduct would allow for discrimination
in circumstances that
are personal. Further, in LRAC’s view, an approach which addresses public
life generally will mean that
the operation of the ACT’s
anti-discrimination law is closer to other laws that regulate people’s
conduct, such as criminal
law and torts, and is following the lead given by
other legislation.
In response to concerns that coverage in all areas of public life would be
burdensome to some groups, LRAC considers that few activities
or groups of
people or interests are not currently covered by the
Discrimination Act
and that the amendment is intended to achieve greater clarity and certainty of
coverage. The discussion below, about the alternative
approach of extending
coverage to just three further specified activities, illustrates how broad the
current coverage is.
Specified areas
If the recommended approach of prohibiting discrimination in all areas of
public life is rejected, and the current approach of covering
specified areas is
retained, additional areas could be covered to better protect against
discrimination in public life. While the
Australian Christian Lobby submitted
that the coverage of the Act ‘is currently adequate’ and
‘should not be extended,
nor should any new areas of coverage be
organisations submitted that certain areas should be included in the scope of
coverage. For example, the ACT Human Rights Commission

following personal attributes (set out in alphabetical order): age;
breastfeeding; disability;
gender identity; industrial activity; pregnancy;
profession, trade, occupation or calling; race; relationship status; religious
political conviction; sex; sexuality; spent conviction; and status as a
parent or carer.
The protected attributes have not been comprehensively reviewed since the
Discrimination Act
commenced more than 20 years ago. The following
discussion draws on recent law reform and consultation in other Australian
to recommend possible amendments to the attributes currently
protected against discrimination.

other than those listed is permitted. In contrast
to this approach, Women With

discrimination lies’.
Dr Asmi Wood similarly submits that the list of attributes should be inclusive,
not exclusive. In his view, the potential for other
attributes should be a

of protected attributes risks creating uncertainty about when discrimination is
and is not lawful, and risks
failing to provide sufficient guidance to
duty-bearers about the scope of their responsibilities. LRAC considers that the
ACT Government
should instead refine and add to the existing attributes as
discussed below, and adopt other means of strengthening the protections
discrimination that are recommended elsewhere, such as a positive duty.
It is unlawful under the
Discrimination Act
to discriminate on the
basis of disability. The definition of disability includes the total or partial
loss of a bodily function
or body part; themalfunction, malformation or
disfigurement of a body part; the presence of organisms that cause or are
causing disease; an illness or condition which impairs thought
processes, perception of reality, emotions or judgement or which results
disturbed behaviour and intellectual disability or developmental
As noted by the ACT
Human Rights Commission, it is unclear whether conditions such as dyslexia and
attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder fall within the definition of
‘disability’.
Submissions on this issue address two important questions; first, whether the
definition of disability should incorporate disorder
or malfunctions which
result in a person learning differently from others and, secondly, whether the
definition should reflect the
medical model or the social model of
disability.
A further issue,
not addressed in submissions, relates to genetic status.
Disorder or malfunction
There have been significant developments in state and federal disability
legislation since the definition of disability in the
Discrimination Act
was drafted. For example, the definition of disability in the Commonwealth
Discrimination Act
was amended in 2009 to include
‘behaviour that is a symptom or manifestation of the disability’.
More recently, the Exposure
Draft of the Commonwealth Human Rights and
Anti-Discrimination Bill 2012 included in its definition of disability a
or malfunction which results in a person learning differently
from a person without the disorder or malfunction’ in place of
‘intellectual disability or developmental
The ACT Human Rights Commission and the Welfare Rights and Legal Centre (ACT
and Region) agree that the definition of disability should
be extended to
include ‘a disorder or malfunction that results in a person learning
differently from a person without the disorder
malfunction’.
notes that including reference to disorder and malfunction may tend to reinforce
a negative, ‘medical’ model of
disability, and fail to acknowledge
the more positive social model, as is discussed below. Nevertheless, LRAC did
not receive any
submissions that the detailed, medically-driven definition of
disability be abandoned. Rather, submissions favour the adoption of
measures, such as reasonable adjustments, to promote an understanding of the
social dimensions of disability.
In LRAC’s view
, the current definition of
‘disability’ should be amended to clearly incorporate disorders or
malfunctions which result
in a person learning differently from others. This
would provide greater clarity as to the scope of the definition, and would give
effect to the guarantee in the
Human Rights Act
of equal and effective
protection against discrimination.
Social model of disability
Both People With Disabilities ACT and Advocacy for Inclusion submit that the
definition of disability ‘should be amended to
use the social model of
disability’.
model, disability is understood to occur ‘when a person’s impairment
interacts with societal barriers in a society
that has not been designed to
accommodate the access needs of people with impairments’.
‘[M]edical diagnosis
is not significant’ and ‘[d]isability is an aspect of identity
rather than an object for medical
intervention’.
for Inclusion explains that under this model, ‘[d]iscrimination occurs on
the basis of a person’s impairment
and related impairment support or
access needs, as well as the basis of a disability arising out of an
inaccessible society’.
People With Disabilities ACT notes that by contrast medical model ‘is
deficient in that it excludes many people who cannot
demonstrate a medical
diagnosis’.
Significantly, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities (CRPD) is based on the social model of
disability.
The ACT Human
Rights Commission submits that ‘it is ‘both appropriate and
desirable’ to amend the definition of
disability to better reflect the
Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities
The social model of disability is recognised in federal
Discrimination Act
, which defines discrimination to be both less favourable
treatment of a person because of their disability, and also less favourable
treatment of a person with a disability
because of the failure to make
reasonable adjustments
for the person. The latter definition focuses not on
the person’s disability, but on the environment in which a person with
disability is engaging in activity (such as employment). The Victorian
Opportunity Act
similarly recognises the social model of disability by
requiring the making of reasonable adjustments, although the approach to
is different and perhaps preferable, defining discrimination to be any
of direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, and contravention
obligation to make reasonable adjustments.
Dr Asmi Wood proposes that the definition of disability be as broad as
possible, and left to the courts to be evaluated on a number
of bases including
expert evidence when necessary. He notes, for example, that in New South Wales
the definition of mental health
is based in common law, whereas elsewhere,
legislative definitions are more complicated and have the potential to exclude

Genetic predisposition
In 2008 the Australian Genetic Discrimination Project reported clients’
perceptions and experiences regarding alleged differential
treatment associated
with having genetic information (eg neurological conditions and familial
Specific incidents
of alleged negative treatment occurred in areas of life such as insurance,
employment, and health services.
In 2009 the
Discrimination Act
was amended in response to
recommendations made by the Australia Law Reform Commission in its 2003 report
Essentially Yours: The Protection of Human Genetic Information in
clarified that the
Discrimination Act
applies to discrimination on the basis of a genetic predisposition to a
disability. The Victorian
Equal Opportunity Act
was enacted with the same
provision to protect against discrimination on the basis of a genetic
predisposition to a disability.
A further amendment to the
Discrimination Act
inserted, as
an example of a discriminatory request for information, that an employer
‘may not require a prospective employee
to provide genetic information if
the employer intends to use that information to unlawfully discriminate against
the employee on
the ground of a disability of the employee’.
In 2014 the Queensland government announced it would look into the need for
people undergoing genome sequencing to be protected from
discrimination by
insurance agencies and employers as the tests become more widely
There seem to be at least two aspects of genetic testing that have to be
addressed. One can be characterised as ‘genetic status’,
when a person has the attribute of an actual or presumed genetic predisposition
to a disability; this has been addressed
in the Commonwealth
Discrimination Act
and the Victorian
Equal Opportunity Act
clear that that is within the definition of disability. Another aspect is what
can be characterised as ‘genetic information’,
regardless of whether a person has an actual or presumed genetic predisposition
to a disability – a person is
discriminated against in circumstances that
relate to genetic information. Such circumstances may be an unjustifiable
requirement
to undergo genetic testing, or an unjustifiable reliance on genetic
information that indicates not a disability but the absence or
presence of some
other personal characteristic.
In LRAC’s view
Discrimination Act
should be amended
to clarify that the protected attribute of disability includes actual or
presumed genetic predisposition to a disability;
this would give effect to law
reform recommendations from previous inquiries, and to the guarantee in the
Human Rights Act
of equal and effective protection against
discrimination. In coming to this view, LRAC has in mind that conduct can be
and an exemption can be sought.
Further, the
Discrimination Act
should be amended to protect against
reliance on genetic information, which is discussed below as a new attribute.
Related attributes
Separately from disability discrimination, the
Discrimination Act
makes it unlawful to discriminate on the basis that a person with a disability
has an assistance animal or other aid associated with
the disability.

against discrimination on the basis of a disability

Advocacy for Inclusion submits that an approach to the definition of
disability based on the social model, noted above, would cover
support requirements, including assistance animals, hearing loops, wheel chair
or other mobility aid access.
In LRAC’s view,
the definition of disability in the
Discrimination Act
should be amended to incorporate discrimination on the
ground of possessing an assistance animal, or other aid. This would respond
the courts’ criticisms and more closely reflect the social model of
disability, discussed above. It would also eliminate
any confusion caused by its
being the subject of a separate provision.
Past disability
Discrimination Act
, a reference to a protected attribute
includes a reference to an attribute that a ‘person had in the past but no
longer has’.
This does not, however, apply to work-related discrimination
and discrimination by qualifying bodies. For example, under the
Discrimination Act
an employer is able to discriminate against a person
because of a back complaint the person once had but no longer has.
Submissions on this issue unanimously agree that the exception should be
In support of
removing the exception, Advocacy for Inclusion submits that, applying the social
model of disability, ‘if discrimination
arises on the basis of an
impairment that no longer exists, the presence of disability continues due to
social barriers ... and the

People With
Disabilities ACT cites reports of the Commonwealth and ACT Human Rights
Commissions which demonstrate that ‘employment
discrimination complaints
represent the largest percentage of their complaints and that these complaints
are the most intractable
and difficult to
experience, ‘the discriminatory practices and attitudes of qualifying
bodies are a major barrier to the employment of
people with
disabilities’.
In LRAC’s view,
Discrimination Act
should be amended
so that there is no longer an exception for work-related discrimination and
discrimination by qualifying bodies
on the basis of an attribute that a
‘person had in the past but no longer has’. Removing this exception
be more consistent
with the social model of disability discussed above, could
give more people access to work and reduce prejudice, and would give effect
the guarantee in the
Human Rights Act
of equal and effective protection
against discrimination.
If the person is unable to carry out the duties because of a disability, then
discrimination can be justified; if the person is able
to carry out the duties
then a past disability ought not be a barrier to their work.

Religious or political conviction

‘religious or political conviction’. In doing so, it provides
legislative protection
for the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion
and belief in
Human Rights Act 2004
Among Australian anti-discrimination legislation, only the
Discrimination
deals with religious conviction and political conviction in the same
phrase. There is no necessary or usual connection between the
two attributes.
Discrimination Act
does not define ‘religious or political
conviction’. In the absence of a definition, the attributes do not extend
having a religious conviction or political conviction.
Separate attributes
Other Australian anti-discrimination legislation distinguishes between these
attributes, listing and defining them
separately.
The ACT Human
Rights Commission and Dr Asmi Wood submit that the provision in the
Discrimination Act
should be separated into two attributes; Dr Wood notes
that this is not likely to affect the interpretation of the attribute.
In LRAC’s view,
separating the provision into two attributes
would give greater certainty about the scope of the Act and promote consistency
other anti-discrimination legislation in Australia.
Scope of the attributes
The scope of the attributes differs from other jurisdictions.
Anti-discrimination laws in Australia refer variously to political,
religious, ‘belief’, ‘activity’, ‘opinion’
or ‘affiliation’.
In the Northern Territory, religious belief or activity is expressly defined to
include ‘Aboriginal spiritual belief or
Beliefs, convictions, activity, opinions
and affiliations
The ACT Human Rights Commission submits that the
Discrimination Act
should prohibit discrimination on the basis of religious or political belief,
activity, opinion and
affiliation.
More narrowly,
the ACT Bar Association submits that the provision should be amended ‘to
include ‘religious or political
affiliation, background or practice’
as well as ‘religious or political
conviction’’.
In LRAC’s view
, amending the attribute to include belief,
activity, opinion and affiliation would give greater certainty about the scope

It would also accord with the
Human Rights Act
, which recognises the
freedom to demonstrate religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and
Absence of belief
The ACT Human Rights Commission proposes that the attribute of
‘religious conviction’ should be expressly defined to include
of any religious belief, activity, opinion,
affiliation; the current position in ACT law is that the absence of a religious
is not covered by the term ‘religious
conviction’.
Commission does not, however, believe that the absence of a political belief
could or should be a protected
Freedom 4 Faith submits that there is no need to prohibit discrimination on
the grounds of non-belief as well as belief, because ‘anti-discrimination
law seeks to protect groups that have historically been subject to persistent,
sustained and unjustifiable discrimination over time
by the majority and who are
still at risk of such discrimination’, and Australians who continue to
hold and live out a religious
belief are in the minority. In its view,
‘[t]here seems to be no risk of discrimination in Australia on the basis
of non-belief’.
Australian Christian Lobby is similarly of the view that ‘[i]t is
unnecessary to amend the existing attribute of ‘religious

In LRAC’s view,
the attribute of religious or political
conviction should be amended to include
having a religious conviction

Human Rights Act

right of non-discrimination ‘on any ground’ in the ACT.
Consequently, protection should be
available for anyone who experiences
discrimination on the basis of a particular attribute, irrespective of whether
or to what degree
there is a history of discrimination on the basis of that
attribute. In coming to this view, LRAC has in mind that conduct can be
justified, and an exemption can be sought.

attributes of ‘religious conviction’ and ‘political

criminal conviction
Discrimination Act
protects the attribute of having a ‘spent
criminal conviction’, defined by reference to the
Spent Convictions Act
(ACT). A ‘spent’ conviction’ is one that is no longer
part of a person’s criminal history because it is a
less serious offence
that occurred over ten years ago (or five years ago for a juvenile offence).
Discrimination Act
does not prohibit discrimination against a
person whose conviction is not spent, or that is not capable of being spent,
Spent Convictions Act
. For example, a job applicant who has a
conviction that cannot be spent, but that is irrelevant to the particular job,
can be discriminated
against because of that conviction.
Relevance of the conviction
All submissions to LRAC on this issue support amending the
Discrimination
to prohibit discrimination on the basis of an ‘irrelevant criminal
conviction’, rather than a ‘spent criminal
conviction’.
Human Rights Commission explains that it has taken ‘enquiries from people
with relatively minor or irrelevant unspent
criminal convictions who have been
discriminated against, particularly regarding employment
opportunities’.
Commission’s opinion, ‘[t]his is an important issue in the
ACT’; and broadening the scope of this attribute
beyond convictions that
are technically ‘spent’, to include convictions that are not
relevant in the circumstances, would
provide fairer and more consistent
protection to people who are attempting to rehabilitate after offending.
Each of the Tasmanian
Anti-Discrimination Act 1998
and the Northern
Territory (NT)
Anti-Discrimination Act
covers more than an irrelevant
conviction, extending to an irrelevant
criminal record
. The attribute of
‘irrelevant criminal record’ is defined very broadly to encompass
any record ‘relating to arrest,
interrogation or criminal
proceedings’, whether or not a charge was laid against the person, let
alone a conviction recorded;
the NT Act also includes a ‘spent
conviction’ in the definition. In Tasmania and the NT, a conviction is an
‘irrelevant
criminal record’ when ‘the circumstances relating
to the offence for which the person was convicted are not directly
relevant to
the situation in which the discrimination
In January 2015, the ACT Attorney-General announced that men convicted of
consensual homosexual acts in the ACT will be able to apply
to have their
conviction expunged, under legislation to be introduced later this year.
Consensual homosexual sex was illegal in the
ACT until November 1976, and a
person may have been charged with offences including attempted buggery, buggery
on a male person and
indecent assault on a male person. This measure will
address an aspect of discrimination on the basis of an irrelevant conviction
In LRAC’s view
, amending this attribute to refer to, at least,
an ‘irrelevant criminal conviction’, rather than to a ‘spent
conviction’ would, as the ACT Human Rights Commission explains,
provide ‘fairer and more consistent protection’
to people who are
attempting to rehabilitate, and would give effect to the guarantee in the
Human Rights Act
of equal and effective protection against
discrimination.
Involvement in criminal investigation or proceedings, without an actual
conviction, is an attribute that could be the basis of discrimination,
this regard it seems desirable to follow the example of anti-discrimination
legislation in Tasmania and the NT and describe
the attribute by reference to
‘record’ rather than ‘conviction, defining record’
broadly to encompass any
record ‘relating to arrest, interrogation or
criminal proceedings’.
Working with children
Tasmania and the Northern Territory make an exception for irrelevant criminal
record discrimination in relation to ‘the education,
training or care of
children if it is reasonably necessary to protect the physical, psychological or
emotional wellbeing of children
having regard to the relevant
circumstances’.
All submissions on this issue support the inclusion of a similar exception in
Discrimination
For example, COTA
ACT supports an exception ‘where the criminal conviction was for an
offence relevant to the employment situation’,
saying that the question of
whether an exception should apply would ‘depend on the nature of the
offence, time elapsed, and
other reasonable criteria’.
The ACT Human Rights Commission notes that the
Working with
Vulnerable People (Background Checking) Act 2011
already operates as an
exception, permitting discrimination in relation to work with vulnerable people
on the basis of any conviction
other than a spent conviction, and any
‘non-conviction history’ which is largely the matters that are
defined as an irrelevant
criminal record in Tasmania and the Northern Territory.
The Commission submits that an exception in the
Discrimination Act
take into account whether a person is registered under the
Working with
Vulnerable People (Background Checking)
LRAC’s recommended model does not create particular exceptions for
different attributes or circumstances, but allows people
to justify their
conduct as a permissible limit on the right to non-discrimination. Consistently
with this approach, an exception
would not be made for working with children,
but appropriate drafting can ensure that discrimination protection for this
is subject to the provisions of the
Working with
People (Background Checking) Act 2011
In LRAC’s view
, the existing provisions of the
Vulnerable People (Background Checking) Act 2011
ensure that both criminal history and non-conviction information are taken into
account when registering a person to work
with vulnerable people. The continued
operation of that regime would provide an important and necessary exception to
the prohibition
against discrimination on the basis of irrelevant criminal
record. If other circumstances require discrimination then conduct can
justified, and an exemption can be sought.
Recommendation
Discrimination Act
should be amended:
i. to replace the existing protected attribute of ‘spent criminal
conviction’ and its definition with the protected attribute
‘irrelevant criminal record’, defined in the same terms that both
criminal history and non-conviction information
are defined in the
Vulnerable People (Background Checking) Act 2011
ii. so that the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of
irrelevant criminal record is subject to the operation of the
Vulnerable People (Background Checking) Act 2011
as a parent or carer
Discrimination Act
currently protects the attribute of having
‘status as a parent or carer.’ In contrast, the Commonwealth
prohibits ‘adverse action’ (which includes
discrimination) on the basis of a person’s ‘family or carer’s
responsibilities’. Approaches in other jurisdictions vary significantly.
For example, the South Australian
Equal Opportunity Act
protects the
attribute of having ‘caring
responsibilities’,
while the Western Australian
Equal Opportunity Act
protects the attribute
of ‘family status’.
The phrase ‘status as a parent or carer’ in the
Discrimination
could be amended to reflect a similarly broad approach; for example, the
attribute could be framed to relate to a person’s
‘family or caring
responsibilities’.
Submissions to LRAC support amending this attribute to make it more
Carers ACT submits
that the Act should be amended to refer to ‘responsibilities’,
rather than ‘status’, on
the basis that the term 'status' denotes a
that arise out of the role of being a parent or carer. It agrees with
LRAC’s observation in the Consultation Paper that the
current description
of this attribute may 'fail to protect a person who is discriminated against
because they have to attend to the
responsibilities that flow from that status'.
Carers ACT draws LRAC’s attention to the detrimental impact of caring
responsibilities on a person’s ability to particulate
in the workforce. It
also highlights that ‘carers’ struggle with employers, including
their experiences of discrimination’.
For example, it cites the
Australian Unity Index Survey Report, which found that ‘career progression
may be more difficult
for carers than the general population’.
It provides three case studies in
which employers were unwilling to negotiate flexible working relationships with
employees who were
also carers, and assumed that the carer would not be able to
work and maintain their caring role long term.
Dr Asmi Wood proposes that the attribute should just refer to carer, but
include a definition that does not exclude Aboriginal families.
He expresses
concern that certain people may not be captured in the conventional idea of
Some submissions raise the issue of discrimination against foster carers.
Fiona Tito Wheatland, writing in her capacity as a foster
carer, Carer Advocate,
and previous President of the ACT Foster Care Association, expresses concern
that there is ‘almost no
protection [for foster carers] under the general
laws in the community’. She notes, for example, that foster carers are not

Similarly, LRAC considers that the term ‘status’ should be replaced
with ‘responsibilities’,
to ensure that the

parent or carer, but may not have the ‘status’
of parent or carer.
Amending the definition to cover parent or carer responsibilities would give
effect to the guarantee in the

of equal and effective
protection against discrimination, and would provide stronger protection against

Recommendation
Discrimination Act
should be amended to replace the existing
protected attribute of ‘status as a parent or carer’ with the
protected attribute
of ‘family, carer or kinship
responsibilities’.
‘characteristics’ extension
Discrimination Act
extends protection on the basis of an attribute
to include protection on the basis of characteristics of the attribute (the
‘characteristics
extension’). Under the characteristics extension,
reference to an attribute includes reference to:
a) a characteristic that people with that attribute generally have; and
b) a characteristic that people with that attribute are generally presumed to
c) such an attribute that a person is presumed to have; and
d) such an attribute that the person had in the past but no longer has.
Similar provisions are found in all other Australian anti-discrimination
laws, and are intended to ensure comprehensive
protection.
For example, a
person of Indian descent, born and raised in India, speaks English with an
Indian accent; if they are refused a job
because of their accent, they are being
discriminated against not because of their race, but because of a characteristic
Pregnancy and
breastfeeding are characteristics of being a woman, although in some
anti-discrimination laws they are given their

Missing from the characteristics extension in the
Discrimination Act
is reference to a characteristic of an attribute that a person
has, even if such a characteristic is not one ‘generally associated’
with that attribute. The characteristics extension

The following discussion draws on recent law reform and consultations in
other Australian jurisdictions to identify possible attributes
(in alphabetical
order) that should now be protected against discrimination.
violence and family violence
Domestic or family violence occurs when one family member or person in an
intimate relationship uses violent or abusive behaviour
against another family
member or person in that relationship. Such violence can include physical,
verbal, psychological, economic
or sexual abuse. There are comprehensive,
contemporary definitions of domestic violence and family violence in s 13 of the
Domestic Violence and Protection Orders Act 2008
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth) respectively.
Women and children are more likely to be victims of domestic or family
violence, and a significant proportion of such violence is
perpetrated at home.
Research shows that many people experience discrimination in areas such as
employment and accommodation because they have been subjected
to domestic or
family violence.
For example,
a person is treated unfavourably at work because they have to take time off to
attend court to get a protection order
in relation to domestic or family
violence, or because their partner contacts them at work to abuse or harass
LRAC is aware that the ACT Government has implemented a range of measures to

submission, the Women’s Legal Centre (ACT and Region) cites an example of
a woman who was terminated from
her employment due to her employer’s
concern about the workplace health and safety risk posed by the presence of her

In its view, ‘providing
protection from discrimination on the basis of a person having been
‘threatened with or subjected
to domestic violence or family
violence’ would fulfil an important educative function’, by raising
awareness in the community
and business about the impact of domestic / family
violence on other aspects of public life, and supporting victims/survivors

their lives’.
In LRAC’s view,
including the attribute of ‘being
subjected to domestic violence or family violence’ would appropriately
extend the protection
Discrimination Act
to a vulnerable part of
the ACT community, and would give effect to the guarantee in the
Human Rights
of equal and effective protection against discrimination. Regard should
be had to the definitions of domestic violence and family
violence in s 13 of
Domestic Violence and Protection Orders Act 2008
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth) respectively. In coming to this view, LRAC
has in mind that conduct can be justified, and an exemption can be sought.
status and homelessness
Discrimination Act
does not protect the attributes of unemployment
status or accommodation status, including homelessness. People in the ACT have,
reported experiencing discrimination on the basis of their employment
status, receiving Centrelink or compensation payments, or being
unemployed.
People on unemployment benefits report being treated unfavourably based on
inaccurate assumptions about their lifestyle,
character, or ability to pay.
Similarly, people are discriminated against because they have no fixed
address, or security of accommodation tenure. For example,
discrimination occurs
if a person tries to make an appointment with a local medical practitioner but
is told that they cannot be
put in the appointment system unless they have a
fixed home address, and when an assumption is made about a person’s
means or lifestyle because they are border or lodger. Research
suggests that such discrimination can cause and further entrench homelessness,
when it prevents a person from securing accommodation and accessing support

race to include ‘ethno-religious origin’ as

not to go that far.
Discrimination Act
does cover the attributes of both race and
religious conviction, and so there is no need to protect an attribute of
‘ethno-religious
origin’. The Act does not, however, currently cover
both those attributes in relation to vilification, and it is to this gap
coverage that the ACT Human Rights Commission’s submission is addressed.
The effect of Recommendation 4 above responds to
this, and extends protection
against vilification to both race and religion.
In LRAC’s view
, there is no need to add the attribute of
ethno-religious origin to the
Discrimination Act
, as the effect of
Recommendation 4 will be to give protection against vilification on the basis of
both race and religion.
Genetic information
Two aspects of genetic testing are discussed above: ‘genetic
status’, for which an amendment to the definition of disability
recommended (Recommendation 7.2) and ‘genetic information’ when
– regardless of whether a person has an actual
or presumed genetic
predisposition to a disability – a person is discriminated against in
circumstances that relate to genetic
information. Such circumstances may be an
unjustifiable requirement to undergo genetic testing, or an unjustifiable
reliance on genetic
information that indicates not a disability but the absence
or presence of some other personal characteristic.
In LRAC’s view
Discrimination Act
should be amended
to protect against requests for and reliance on genetic information, giving
effect to the guarantee in the
Human Rights Act
of equal and effective
protection against discrimination. In coming to this view, LRAC has in mind that
conduct can be justified,
and an exemption can be sought.
Immigration
Discrimination Act
currently provides protection on the basis of
nationality, citizenship and race, but there is no specific protection for a
immigration status; that is, whether they are born in Australia
or overseas, and the terms on which they are in Australia. Almost
a quarter of
the ACT’s population was born overseas.
Discrimination on the basis of immigration status occurs when, for example, a
person is refused sporting club membership on the basis
that they are in
Australia on a student or bridging visa, or a person is treated unfavourably
because they were born overseas.
Anti-discrimination legislation in the Northern Territory and Tasmania
includes ‘being or having been an immigrant’ in
the definition of
race. The Commonwealth
Discrimination Act
xtends the grounds of
prohibited discrimination to the status of being ‘an immigrant’.

, providing protection from discrimination on the
basis of immigration status would appropriately extend the protection of the
Discrimination Act
to a vulnerable part of the ACT community, and would
give effect to the guarantee in the
Human Rights Act
of equal and
effective protection against discrimination. Such a provision in the Act would
not affect the conduct of the Federal
Government. In coming to this view, LRAC
has in mind that conduct can be justified, and an exemption can be sought.
Intersex status
The term ‘intersex’ refers to people who are born with genetic,
hormonal or physical characteristics that are not exclusively
or ‘female’. An intersex person may have biological attributes of
both sexes, or lack some of the
biological attributes that are usually defined
as male or female. Although the relevant biological attributes of an intersex
are present at birth, the person may not necessarily be aware of their
intersex status until adolescence or adulthood.
Intersex status is a matter of biology, not gender identity. An intersex
person may choose to identify, consistently or at different
times, as male,
female, intersex or in a different way.

Discrimination Act
does not provide any protection from
discrimination on the basis of ‘physical features’. Physical
features could be defined,
for example, to include a person’s height,
weight, size or other bodily characteristics including their shape, facial
or birthmarks.
Protection on the basis of physical features has been in place in Victoria
since 1995. When introducing the relevant provision, the
then Victorian
Attorney-General said:
Society places too much emphasis on a person’s bodily characteristics,
over which the person may not have much control. For
instance, a person may not
have any control over a birthmark across his or her face. A person’s
physical features should not
be used to judge the suitability of the person for
a job. Ultimately, such judgment should be based on performance criteria. If a
person is the best qualified person and can perform the required duties, the
fact that he or she is of a certain height or weight
irrelevant.

of physical features is reasonably necessary to protect

Discrimination Act
prohibits sexual harassment in employment,
educational institutions, providing access to public premises, providing goods,
facilities and accommodation and by club committee members.
The scope of the
prohibition against sexual harassment in employment
is unclear. The Act makes it unlawful for a ‘workplace participant’
to subject another ‘workplace participant’ or ‘person seeking
to become a workplace participant’ to sexual
harassment at a
‘workplace’ or ‘potential workplace’. The term
‘workplace participant’ may not,
for example, cover board members of
a voluntary body.
Differently from harassment that takes place in relation to a person’s
attribute, such as disability or age or gender identity,
sexual harassment is
unique, and is treated separately, because it does not focus on the attribute of
the victim, but on the nature
of the harassing conduct (eg, ‘sexual’
in nature).
Anti-discrimination legislation in Queensland and Tasmania prohibits sexual
harassment in any aspect of life, public or private. The
Exposure Draft of the
Commonwealth Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill proposed to extend
coverage of its sexual harassment
provisions to include all areas of public
life, and the Explanatory Notes to that Bill stated that the patchy coverage of
harassment provisions in the Commonwealth
Discrimination
are undesirable as they create unnecessary complexity and uncertainty as
to when such conduct is unlawful. This approach could be
taken in the ACT, and
sexual harassment could apply in all areas of public life.

than coverage for harassment because of other attributes.

clear that such conduct is prohibited regardless of whether

• the prohibition against sexual harassment be extended to cover a

they deal with in the
course of their employment’.
In LRAC’s view,
Discrimination Act
continues to
specify areas of coverage, it should be amended to address the gaps that exist
around ‘workplace’, ‘workplace
participant’ and
situations that are connected with work but do not occur in the workplace. LRAC
did not propose and has not
consulted on the recommendations made by the
Women’s Legal Centre ACT, but is of the view that they appear desirable
and warrant
consideration.
Recommendation
Recommendation 15.1
Discrimination Act
should be amended to prohibit sexual
harassment generally, in all areas of life.
Recommendation 15.2
If Recommendation 15.1 is not accepted and the current specified areas of
coverage for sexual harassment are retained, then
Discrimination Act
should be amended so that:
a. the meaning of ‘workplace’ extends to cover a place, other
than the usual place of work, where work-related activities
occurred, and
b. the meaning of ‘‘workplace participant’ extends to
cover a person, other than the usual workers in the workplace,
who participates
in a work-related activity.
2. consideration should be given to
a. extending the prohibition to cover sexual harassment by any person in a
position of authority in a club
b. prohibiting conduct that does not occur in the presence of the
c. extending the prohibition to cover sexual harassment by a person
performing any function or exercising any power under an ACT law
purposes of an ACT government program, or in the course of carrying out any
other responsibility for the administration
of an ACT law or the conduct of an
ACT government program
d. extending the prohibition to cover sexual harassment when a person is
seeking or receiving goods, services or facilities.
A common understanding of harassment is some form of unfavourable treatment
because of a protected attribute. As is discussed above,
sexual harassment is
unique, and is treated separately, because it does not focus on the attribute of
the victim, but on the nature
of the harassing conduct (eg, ‘sexual’
in nature).
Discrimination Act
does not prohibit harassing conduct in relation
to a protected attribute. Although harassing conduct can be said to be direct
discrimination,
as unfavourable treatment because of an attribute, that approach
does not provide sufficient coverage as is discussed below.
An example of prohibit harassing conduct in relation to a protected attribute
is in the federal
Discrimination Act
, where it is unlawful to
harass a person with a disability, in relation to their disability, in
employment, education and the provision
of goods and

harassing conduct will often if not usually be, as well, direct discrimination
(less favourable treatment because of a
person’s attribute) it will not
always be so, and a stand-alone definition of harassment, in the wider terms of
Discrimination Act
, is appropriate.
LRAC recommends above that discrimination be unlawful in all areas of life
other than in private, and the same approach should be
taken for other forms of
unlawful conduct, such as harassment. If, as is proposed above, harassment is
included in the
Discrimination Act
as a form of prohibited conduct, then
it would be prohibited in relation to all attributes, such as age, sexuality,
disability, and
intersex status.
LRAC recommends below that a defence is available for justifiable conduct. It
is highly unlikely that harassment could be justified,
but with the general
availability of a justification defence for unlawful conduct, the opportunity
In LRAC’s view
, harassing conduct is to a large extent already
covered by protection against direct discrimination, which means that there is
coverage for harassment on the basis of any protected attribute. It is,
however, desirable to make specific provision for harassment
for at least two
reasons: all manifestations of harassing conduct may not be covered by a
prohibition against direct discrimination,
and as a matter of public policy and
education, harassment should be clearly identified as prohibited conduct, apart
from discrimination.
Recommendation 16

relation to a protected
VILIFICATION AND OFFENSIVE
Discrimination Act
prohibits vilification, which occurs when
‘a person, by a public act, incite[s] hatred towards, serious contempt
for, or severe
ridicule of, a person or group of people’ on the basis of
race, sexuality, gender identity or HIV/AIDS status
Vilification provisions exist in the
Discrimination Act
for a small range of different attributes, in all other State and Territory
no provision is made to cover
vilification, and Western Australia, where racial vilification is an offence in
Criminal Code
. The different attributes that are protected in
different jurisdictions are race, religion, sexuality, gender identity, and
status. In the ACT, the
Discrimination Amendment Bill 2012
added ‘religion’ to the attributes that are protected against
vilification, however the Bill lapsed and was
not enacted into law.
As well as a vilification provision, Tasmania has an offensive conduct
provision that protects all attributes.
and definitions
To facilitate understanding of the law’s approach to this issue, LRAC
proposes clearly defined terms that distinguish the different
approaches in
different laws around Australia. The generally used term is
‘vilification’
which, as is explained below, takes two forms in the legislation: incitement to
hatred etc (in the ACT, for example), and causing
offence etc (in the
and Tasmania). For clarity, this discussion uses the term
‘vilification’ to refer to incitement to hatred etc, and uses
term ‘offensive conduct’ to refer to causing offence etc.
The two types of conduct are different in their policy focus and practical
effect. Vilification is conduct that is likely to stir
up feelings of, for
example, hatred, serious contempt or severe ridicule against a person or people
because of an attribute they
have; an example is a video or pamphlet or
statement that says that gay men are ‘depraved’, ‘sexual
or ‘paedophiles’. Offensive conduct is conduct that
is likely to, for example, offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate
a person or
people because of an attribute they have; an example is a
video or pamphlet or statement that says that lesbians are not fit to be
parents. In some circumstances, conduct that is vilification
may also be
offensive conduct, while in some circumstances conduct that is offensive may not
be vilification.
Both vilification and offensive conduct are described in different ways in
the legislation. The usual description of vilification
is conduct that is likely
‘to incite hatred, serious contempt and severe ridicule’; the
Equal Opportunity Act
‘revulsion’.
This requires a complainant to prove the likelihood of incitement. Although the
ACT’s ‘incitement’ model prohibits
conduct that
‘incites’ hatred etc, in practice this is treated as a test of
whether the person’s conduct was
reasonably likely
to incite hatred
A variation on this approach is for legislation to prohibit not incitement,
but expression, on the basis that conduct that expresses
hatred etc is likely to
incite those feelings. This would require a complainant to prove only that the
conduct occurred, and was
the approach taken in the original draft of the NSW
legislation. Because there will be occasions when the conduct does not directly
express hatred etc but is, in the circumstances, likely to incite it, both
approaches could operate concurrently.
Although the
Discrimination Act
prohibition is often
referred to as a vilification or ‘racial hatred’ provision, what it
prohibits is ‘offensive
conduct’: conduct that is likely to
‘offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate’. Tasmania’s
conduct’ provision prohibits conduct that ‘offends,
humiliates, intimidates, insults or ridicules’. The
Discrimination Act
requires proof of likelihood, in the circumstances, of
the effect of the conduct; Tasmania requires both proof of the effect of the
conduct, and of the likelihood, in the circumstances, of a reasonable
person’s anticipating that effect.
As is the case in all anti-discrimination laws that address vilification and
offensive conduct, there is a broad ‘free speech’
exception in the
Discrimination Act
that allows a fair report of the public act;
communication of anything that would be protected by absolute privilege in
(such as what is said in parliament or the courts); and academic,
artistic, scientific or research activity in the public interest,
discussion or debate.
In the ACT, the
Human Rights Act
recognises the right to freedom of
expression, ‘subject only to reasonable limits set by laws that can be
demonstrably justified
in a free and democratic society’. Vilification
provisions such as those in the
Discrimination Act
are usually accepted
as a reasonable limit on free expression that can be demonstrably justified.
Similar limits on free expression
are in, for example, laws about defamation,
misleading consumer statements, obscenity, pornography, blasphemy, and inciting
Submissions received on the vilification provisions focus on five principal
issues: the areas in which vilification should be prohibited,
the attributes
that should be protected, the appropriate test for vilification, possible
exceptions to the prohibition on vilification,
and the offence of serious
vilification.
As noted above, the
Discrimination Act
currently prohibits
vilification in relation to ‘public acts’. The ACT Human Rights
Commission supports amending the
scope of the provisions to vilification
‘done otherwise than in private’. In the Commission’s view,
the current
law leaves ‘too much potential for a restrictive
interpretation, which can exclude conduct that should be
People With Disabilities ACT acknowledges the ‘practical
problems’ that can arise from the need for a person alleging
vilification
to prove that the vilifying conduct was ‘a public act’. It does,
however, emphasise that if the provisions
are extended to cover acts done
otherwise than in private ‘this should be done with great care so as not
to excessively intrude
into the private
Dr Asmi Wood
submits that the coverage of the vilification provisions should continue to be
limited to acts done ‘in public’,
rather than ‘otherwise than
in private’, due to the lack of clarity associated with ‘otherwise
than in private’.
In Dr Wood’s opinion, ‘public’ should
have a certain definition.
In contrast to the prohibitions against discrimination, vilification in the
ACT is currently prohibited only in relation to the attributes
sexuality, gender identity or HIV/AIDS status. Some submissions to LRAC propose
that particular attributes could be added
to this list. For example, People With
Disabilities ACT supports extending the coverage of the vilification provisions
to the attribute
of disability. It submits that ‘[p]eople with
disabilities are particularly vulnerable to vilification’, especially in
social media’ and provides an example of a person with a disability who
was vilified for lodging a discrimination complaint
on a website
‘sponsored by a major ACT Government owned Corporation’. The ACT
Human Rights Commission also submits that
disability could be added to the list
of protected attributes against vilification as a priority, noting that such an
amendment is
supported by several community
The ACT Human Rights Commission submits that consideration be given ‘to
making it unlawful to vilify someone on the basis of
any attribute currently
protected by unlawful discrimination under the
The Commission
notes that it has previously ‘recommended that religious vilification be
considered in response to dissemination
of anti-Islamic Chick Cartoons and
leaflets criticising the proposed construction of a Mosque in Gungahlin’,
and notes recent
instances of vilification in Canberra, such as the attack on
the Canberra Islamic Centre.
The Commission suggests that ‘community consultation may be necessary for
such a change, including consideration to determine
if the same thresholds,
tests and exceptions are used for all forms of
vilification’.
Freedom 4 Faith submits that the vilification prohibitions should not extend
to vilification on the basis of religious conviction,
because this ‘would
be more likely to create division and increased tension rather than community
cohesion’. It cites
the Victorian case of
Islamic Council of Victoria
(ICV) v Catch the Fire Ministries (CFM
) as an example of how religious
vilification laws encourage litigation ‘as the preferred method of dispute
resolution.’
The ACT Bar Association submits that ‘[p]eople should be protected from
vilification for any of the reasons or attributes against
which discrimination
is prohibited...’, subject to amendments to those attributes recommended
by the Association and discussed
In the course of LRAC’s public consultations, it was submitted that
vilification protection should be limited to personal attributes
that are not a
matter of choice, such as race, and should not be available for personal
attributes that are a matter of choice, such
view, however, the criterion of choice cannot guide the extent of vilification
protection. A person’s religion
is not necessarily a matter of choice,
most obviously for children, and when it is deeply connected to a person’s
culture and
identity. And it is not correct to assume that a person’s
‘race’ is involuntary: a dimension of ‘race’,
defined, is ‘nationality’, which can be chosen.
Test for vilification
Freedom 4 Faith reiterates its support for ‘[existing] prohibitions on
vilification that are carefully drafted and target the
hatred or violence’ (emphasis
The ACT Bar
Association similarly submits that ‘vilification’ should be defined
to refer to inciting hatred or actual
harm, and should avoid subjective tests of
liability so as not to unduly abridge traditional freedoms of expression and of
Differently, the ACT Human Rights Commission recommends that the
Discrimination Act
be amended to contain ‘a new test and threshold
for what constitutes unlawful vilification’. Complaints received by the
Commission show that experiences of vilification and racist abuse occur
frequently for some people in the ACT. However, the conduct
rarely meets the
test for ‘incitement’ in the
Discrimination Act
Commission noted that in 2006 the former Human Rights Office
recommended
adopting the ‘racially offensive behaviour’ provisions in the
Commonwealth
Racial Hatred Act 1995
. In the event that vilification is
prohibited for other attributes, the Commission submits that
‘consideration should be given
as to whether the same tests and thresholds
should apply to all
attributes’.
Discrimination Act
, a public act is not unlawful when it is
‘done reasonably and honestly, for academic, artistic, scientific or
research purposes

LRAC recommends providing for justifiable limits for all prohibited conduct,
discussed below. The current circumstances in which vilification
is permitted
would be covered by a justifiable limits provision, and so freedom of expression
is limited only to that extent.
In LRAC’s view
, there are compelling reasons to prohibit
vilification
, occurring otherwise than in private, in relation to the
same attributes that are protected by the prohibition on discrimination.
Vilification would be defined as conduct that expresses, or is likely in the
circumstances to incite, hatred towards, serious contempt
of, severe ridicule
towards or revulsion of, a person or people with a protected attribute.
There are, as well, compelling reasons to prohibit
offensive conduct
occurring otherwise than in private, in relation to the same attributes that are
protected by the prohibition on discrimination
except for the attribute of
religious belief, activity, opinion and affiliation
; this limitation is
discussed in the following paragraph. Offensive conduct would be defined as
conduct that is likely, in the circumstances,
to offend, insult, humiliate or
intimidate a person or people because of a protected attribute that they have,
but for religious
Unlike other attributes, it can be argued that the attribute of religious
belief carries with it the risk of causing offence on the
basis of religion; for
monotheistic religions, an adherent’s exercise of free religious
expression may necessarily cause offence
to the adherent to another religion.
More generally, it is likely that criticism of a religion will offend adherents
to that religion.
A prohibition against causing offence on the basis of
religious belief does not, therefore, seem practical. Differently from causing
offence, however, vilification on the basis of religious belief is beyond the
usual bounds of both free religious expression and
more general criticism of a
religion, and a prohibition against vilification on the basis of religious
belief seems appropriate.
Exceptions that allow freedom of expression would continue to be available
under a justification defence, discussed below.
Serious vilification
Discrimination Act
also currently creates a criminal offence of
‘serious vilification’, which occurs when a person intentionally
in a public act that threatens harm, and is reckless about whether that
act incites hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe
ridicule of, a
person or group of people on the basis of race, sexuality, gender identity or
HIV/AIDS status. There have not yet
been any prosecutions for this offence in
the ACT. The ‘serious vilification’ offence provision in the
Discrimination Act
is modelled substantially on the NSW provision which,
similarly, has never been used. In 2013 a NSW Parliamentary Committee report
recommended that the offence of serious vilification be retained as a matter of
policy, with procedural changes that might make it
Those recommendations
are set out at Appendix 1 of this report.
The ACT Human Rights Commission supports the opinion of the NSW Parliamentary
Committee that the offence should be retained as a matter
of public policy. It
is, however, concerned that ‘this offence can become ‘lost’ in
Discrimination Act
Accordingly, it submits that
‘consideration should be given to moving it to a piece of law more readily
utilised by law enforcement,
such as the
Crimes Act 1900
Criminal Code 2002
(ACT) as is the case in Western Australia’.
Dr Asmi Wood similarly submits
that the provision should be contained in the
Criminal Code
, rather than
in a civil procedure document. Dr Wood is also concerned that the word
‘serious’ is misleading, because
it implies that there is
‘non-serious’ vilification.
In LRAC’s view
, the name of the offence should be changed from
‘serious vilification’ to ‘aggravated vilification’, or
vilification’, and consideration should be given to
adopting so many of the recommendations made by the 2013 report of the
Standing Committee on Law and Justice on serious vilification as are appropriate
for the ACT; those recommendations are set out
at Appendix 1 of this report.
Recommendation
Recommendation 17.1
Discrimination Act
should be amended to prohibit conduct,
called ‘vilification’, which occurs otherwise than in private and
that expresses,
or is reasonably likely in the circumstances to incite, hatred
towards, serious contempt for, severe ridicule towards or revulsion
of, a person
or people with a protected attribute.
Recommendation 17.2
Discrimination Act
should be amended to prohibit conduct,
called ‘offensive conduct’, which occurs otherwise than in private
and that offends,
insults, humiliates or intimidates another person because of a
protected attribute other than religious belief.
Recommendation 17.3
The offence of serious vilification should be renamed
‘aggravated’ or ‘criminal’ vilification.
Recommendation 17.4
Consideration should be given to adopting so many of the recommendations
made by the 2013 report of the NSW Standing Committee on
Law and Justice on
serious vilification as are appropriate for the ACT.
a limit on the right to non-discrimination
Discrimination Act
, exceptions excuse discriminatory conduct.
Exceptions recognise that treating someone differently may be justified because
considerations. An exception operates as a defence to a discrimination
complaint: after the conduct happened, a person will say that
their conduct
should be excused because it was justified. This is different from an
when, before
conduct happens – particularly if it
is likely to be continuing or recurring – a person anticipates their
intended discriminatory
conduct is justified, and seeks to be excused in
advance; this would be the subject of an
application, discussed
separately below.
Discrimination Act
currently contains general, broad exceptions
that apply in relation to all attributes, and some specific exceptions in
relation to
particular attributes. The exceptions are in different sections in
Discrimination Act
, lacking a clear, principled and unifying approach
to excusing discriminatory conduct.
At the same time that exceptions to discrimination are recognised in the
Discrimination Act
Human Rights Act
non-discrimination as a human right, and permits limitations on that right only
if they are reasonable and ‘can
be demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society’.
In overseas jurisdictions that have both anti-discrimination laws and human
rights legislation, such as the United Kingdom and Canada,
exceptions for
discrimination are dealt with under a ‘human rights’ approach, where
the question is whether the discriminatory
conduct is necessary, and a
proportional and reasonable limit on the right to
non-discrimination.
Victoria, where there is human rights legislation (
Charter of Human Rights
and Responsibilities)
, this approach was not taken, and the Victorian Act
has the same range of exceptions that are in the
Discrimination Act
guarantees the right to non-discrimination subject
only to reasonable limits.
The enactment of the
Human Rights Act 2004
has substantial
implications for the form and content of the
Discrimination Act
particularly in the area of exceptions. As noted above, the
Human Rights Act
recognises and protects a number of rights, including ‘the right to
equal and effective protection against discrimination on
and the right
to demonstrate one’s ‘religion or belief in worship, observance,
practice and
teaching...’.
rights are limited only to the extent to which the limitation ‘can be
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
Factors which
must be considered in assessing whether a limitation is
a. the nature of the right affected;
b. the importance of the purpose of the limitation;
c. the nature and extent of the limitation
d. the relationship between the limitation and its purpose;
e. any less restrictive means reasonably available to achieve the purpose the
limitation seeks to achieve.
By contrast, the right to non-discrimination protected by the
Discrimination Act
is limited by a range of exceptions throughout the Act
which may be relied upon in a variety of circumstances subject to certain
being satisfied.
Submissions that LRAC received on this issue evaluate the current approach to
exceptions, and the alternative of a general limitations
clause (a justification
defence) similar to that in the
Human Rights Act
. For example, the
Australian Christian Lobby submits that the adoption of a general limitations
clause would be preferable to retaining
the exceptions model. In its view,
‘provisions which exist in order to protect fundamental human rights, such
as freedom of
religion, should not be regarded as mere
‘exceptions’’.
The Australian Christian Lobby recommends ‘a general limitations
clause, which would clarify that conduct which is necessary
to achieve a
legitimate objective and is a proportionate means of achieving that objective is
not discrimination. Rather than being
considered as discriminatory conduct which
is exempt from the law, it would not be considered discrimination’.
The Australian Christian Lobby
makes the point that characterising other rights, such as freedom of religion,
as exceptions to the
right of non-discrimination fails to give full recognition
to those other rights, and that a general limitations clause will give
appropriate recognition to those other rights.
The Women’s Legal Centre (ACT and Region) also supports the inclusion
of a general limitations clause in preference to the exceptions,
United Kingdom’s
Equality Act 2010
, which imports a simple test of
whether the conduct is a ‘proportionate means of achieving a legitimate
end or purpose’.
well, both organisations prefer the exemptions model, discussed below, which
requires an application to the ACT Human Rights Commission
for permission to
engage in conduct that is otherwise prohibited by the legislation before
engaging in that conduct.
International law and the law of jurisdictions such as Canada offer clear
guidance as to the type of justifications that can be made
out for limiting
different rights. These cases, the associated commentary, and guidelines
produced by the ACT Human Rights Commission,
would complement jurisprudence
Human Rights Act
the amended
Discrimination Act
, to provide guidance
bearers as to the sort of conduct that should be avoided.
An important implication of moving to a general limitations provision for all
discriminatory conduct is that a defence will be available
discrimination that does not currently exist. Under the current
Discrimination Act
there is no provision to argue that direct
discrimination is justifiable in the circumstances; in the absence of an
exception, conduct
that amounts to discrimination is unlawful. This is
consistent with a view that direct discrimination provisions target prejudice,
for which there cannot be a justification. Indirect discrimination, on the other
hand, does allow for an argument that it was justifiable
in the circumstances to
impose the requirement or condition. A general limitations provision for all
discriminatory conduct will
give a person who is alleged to have engaged in
direct discrimination the opportunity to justify their conduct. To the extent
they are justifying prejudice they are unlikely to succeed, but the
opportunity is there.
In LRAC’s view,
many of the current exceptions provisions may be
inconsistent with the requirements of the
Human Rights Act
, because they
permit limitations on rights that are protected by the
Human Rights Act
including the right to non-discrimination, in a manner that is not consistent
with the limitations that are permitted under the
Human Rights Act
Human Rights Act
the right to non-discrimination can only be subject
to reasonable limits ‘set by law that can be demonstrably justified in
free and democratic society.’ Replacing the exception provisions with a
‘general limitations clause’ would promote
consistency with the
rights protections afforded by the
Human Rights Act
, and provide a more
consistent, principled, straightforward and visible way of permitting
discriminatory conduct than is the case
with the current approach to exceptions.
A general limitations clause would operate as a defence to a claim of unlawful
conduct under
Discrimination Act
Recommendation 18
Discrimination Act
should be amended to repeal
(Exceptions to Unlawful Discrimination) and to replace it with a general
limitations clause that operates as ‘justification

exceptions, as an alternative
If, contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence is not enacted and
exceptions are retained, LRAC considers that the following
amendments should be
made to those exceptions. Even if specific exceptions are made, it remains the
case that the
Discrimination Act
operates in an environment where, under
Human Rights Act
the right to equal and effective protection against
discrimination is guaranteed and that right can be limited only according to
test of ‘reasonable limits’, where regard is had to an
inclusive list of considerations. Accordingly, specific exceptions,
adapted to the particular area of activity, do need to be decided according to a
test that is consistent with the test in the
Human Rights Act
limiting the right to non-discrimination.
Rather than a general ‘reasonableness’ test, for example, a test
would be whether the conduct can be justified as a reasonable
limit on the right
to equal and effective protection against discrimination, having regard to the
nature of that right; the purpose
of the conduct and its importance; the nature
of the conduct; the relationship between the conduct and its purpose; and
whether there
was any less restrictive means reasonably available to achieve the
same purpose. Any less rigorous test is inconsistent with the
permissible limits
on human rights under the
Human Rights Act
The ‘statutory authority’ exception
Discrimination Act
excuses discriminatory conduct on the basis of
an attribute if the conduct is necessary to comply with a requirement of an ACT
or court or tribunal order. The exception applies only if the law or order
is mandatory and specific about the conduct that must
be performed and is rarely
available, usually because there is an alternative, non-discriminatory way to
comply with the requirement.
Discrimination Act

intended to be temporary, to allow time for other ACT legislation to be amended

Despite this
intention, the exception remains in place.
There is no known example of an ACT law that is mandatory and specific in
requiring discriminatory conduct, and, since this exception
was enacted, the ACT
has enacted the
Human Rights Act
. All laws must be compatible with the
non-discrimination requirements in the
Human Rights Act
, unless the
Legislative Assembly declares that the law is intended to be incompatible. There
is, however, no requirement that a court
or tribunal order be
non-discriminatory.
All submissions that address this exception support the repeal of the

Rights Commission notes that removing the exception for statutory authorities
would be ‘consistent with the requirements

People With Disabilities ACT and Dr Asmi Wood suggest that in place of the
statutory authority exception the Act could include an
exception for acts under
an order of a court or
In LRAC’s view
, removing this exception would reflect the
original intention of the legislature and promote the ACT’s commitment to
human rights, by recognising the requirement in the
Human Rights
that all laws must now be non-discriminatory unless declared otherwise.
If contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence
is not enacted and
exceptions are retained, then a narrower exception for acts done under an order
of a court or tribunal would provide
adequate protection for people who are
directed to engage in discriminatory conduct by a court or tribunal, provided
that the exception
is available only when the order is mandatory and specific
alternative. An exception in these terms would meet the ‘reasonable
limits’ test under the
Human Rights Act
. In the unlikely event that
the Legislative Assembly does declare that a new law is intended to be
incompatible with the right to
non-discrimination, then compliance with such a
law would be permitted under the justification defence.
for ‘religious bodies’ and educational institutions
Discrimination Act
excuses discriminatory conduct for some matters
relating to religion. Specifically, discriminatory conduct on the basis of any
attribute is excused for:
● training and appointing ministers of religion
● appointing people in connection with a religious observance or
● the acts and practices of religious bodies which:
o conform with the ‘doctrines, tenets or beliefs of that
religion’; and
o ‘are necessary to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of
adherents of that religion’
● religious educational institutions in respect of employment and the
provision of education or training, when the discrimination
is ‘in good
faith to avoid injury to the susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or
Discrimination Act
was enacted in 1991, the ACT has enacted
Human Rights Act
, which guarantees the right to ‘freedom of
thought, conscience and religion’. This includes the freedom to choose and
practise a religion, and the right to not be coerced to adopt or practise a
religion. At the same time, the
Human Rights Act
guarantees the right to
non-discrimination. It is necessary, therefore, to craft exceptions for
discriminatory conduct so that any
limit to the right to non-discrimination
conforms to the precise scope of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and
Reconciling competing rights
Concerns about reconciling competing
rights to non-discrimination and
freedom of religion informed many of the submissions. For example, the
Australian Christian Lobby
is concerned that the language of
‘exceptions’ and ‘exemptions’ ‘may emphasise
non-discrimination at
the cost of too narrow a protection for other fundamental
rights’, including freedom of religion and freedom of
association.
In its view, a
preferable option is a general limitations clause (a justification defence),
because ‘[t]his clarifies that
certain activity, legally,
discrimination’;
is indeed what LRAC recommends at Recommendation 18. If that option is not
possible, the Australian Christian Lobby submits
that the next most preferable
option is to use the exemption provisions, discussed below.
On the other hand, Freedom 4 Faith submits that the exceptions should be
retained on the basis that they ‘ensure that the principle
non-discrimination is appropriately balanced with other human rights, including
rights that are central to maintaining a healthy
multicultural
LRAC notes that, on the question of ‘balance’, which may imply an
attempt to reach a 50/50 compromise, the better approach
is to consider how best
to accommodate competing rights. International law views the right to
non-discrimination as a ‘cross-cutting
right’ – a right that
underpins the enjoyment of all other rights. The ACT
Human Rights Act
for example, guarantees everyone the right to enjoy their human rights
‘without distinction or discrimination of any
When rights
compete, it is necessary to ensure that the rights are limited only so far is
necessary and proportionate. Exceptions
to non-discrimination must therefore
operate to ensure that the right to non-discrimination is limited by the right
to freedom of
religion only so far is necessary and proportionate; this is the
test that would be applied under the recommend approach of a justification
defence in Recommendation 18 above.
The exceptions in the
Discrimination Act
for matters relating to
religion are available on the basis of any protected attribute. As a result,
there is no necessary connection
between a protected attribute and the religious
belief that is being recognised. For example, the
Discrimination Act
allows discrimination on the basis of any attribute when an employee’s
work involves the teaching, observance or practice of
the relevant religion.
This allows discrimination on, for example, the basis of age, disability and
race in circumstances where those
attributes have no relevance to the religious
teaching, observance or practice. Such a limit on the right to
non-discrimination is
neither necessary nor proportionate, and the exception
should be limited to discrimination that is necessary to accord with the
of the particular religion.
People With Disabilities ACT submits that the exception should not apply to
discrimination on the basis of disabilities, except when
that disability is
relevant to the religious observance or practice. It noted that
‘[r]eligious institutions and bodies operate
schools and provide many
social and community services’, and considered that ‘people with
disabilities should not be
denied access to education and to these services by
purported reliance on this
exception’.
Submissions express conflicting views about the different thresholds in the
Discrimination Act
that religious organisations and educational
institutions should be required to meet in order to rely on the
non-discrimination exceptions.
Some consider that the thresholds should be
while others submit
that the current approach should be retained subject to minor
amendments,
different approach be
Although the
Australian Christian Lobby, for example, considers that the current thresholds
are appropriate, but its preference,
discussed above, is an approach based on a
general limitations clause (a justification defence) and the exemptions
Freedom 4 Faith considers that the language of the current religious
exemptions is ‘largely adequate’; however, it proposes
lowering the
threshold of the exception for religious bodies to one that excepts acts that
either conform to the doctrines, tenets
or beliefs of that religion or (rather
than ‘and’) that are necessary to avoid injury to the religious
susceptibilities
of adherents of that religion. In its view, ‘[r]equiring
religious organisations to satisfy both limbs
before they are able to invoke the exception is unnecessarily cumbersome, and
fails to appreciate the different ways that religious
organisations
On the issue
of ‘injury to susceptibilities’, LRAC notes that such a standard is
lower than, for example, the threshold
Discrimination Act
sexual harassment, which requires a person to be ‘offended, humiliated or
intimidated’. The right not to have one’s
religious susceptibilities
injured is not a part of the right to free religious belief that is recognised
Human Rights Act
, and so an exception that extends this far is not
a necessary or proportionate limit on the right to non-discrimination.
The Association of Independent Schools considers that, ‘in respect of
the employment of staff by religious educational institutions
it is sensible
that the exception remain’. It notes that while ‘many schools do not
require that staff are adherents
of a particular religion... they must be
sympathetic to its teaching and will not act in a way that might cause injury to
the religious
susceptibilities of adherents of that
broadly, it considers that it might be preferable ‘for the government to
provide guidance (perhaps through the Act or
regulations) to schools in respect
of ensuring that parents and students, or potential parents and students, are
made aware of the
religious basis of the schools and how this might impact on
the expectation of enrolment, behaviour and participation of students’.
its view, ‘[t]his might preclude the need for the Human Rights Commission
to entertain complaints of perceived discrimination
where they are covered by
the disclosure provided to parents/students before enrolment’.
The Women’s Legal Centre (ACT and Region) submits that, if the
exception is retained, the threshold should, ‘at the very
‘include a ‘reasonableness test’’.
The exception for religious
bodies in Victoria allows an act or practice of a religious body that is
‘reasonably necessary’
to avoid injury to religious
sensitivities,
Australian Law Reform Commission previously recommended that there should be a
test of reasonableness for such
exceptions.
The exception in
Discrimination Act
for religious bodies does not contain a test of
reasonableness.
If an exception is dependent on doctrines, tenets or beliefs of that
religion, Women’s Legal Centre submits that the religious
educational institution should be required to identify the religious doctrine
and the source of the religious authority for
In LRAC’s view,
if contrary to Recommendation 18 a justification
defence is not enacted and exceptions are retained, the scope of the excepted
must be a necessary and proportionate limit on the right to
non-discrimination having regard to the scope of the right to freedom
thought, conscience and religion. This requires, for example, limiting excused
discrimination to attributes that are necessary
to accord with the doctrines of
the particular religion, and ensuring that the conduct can be justified as a
reasonable limit on
the right to equal and effective protection against
discrimination, having regard to the nature of that right; the purpose of the
discriminatory conduct and its importance; the nature of the discriminatory
conduct; the relationship between the discriminatory
conduct and its purpose;
and whether there was any less restrictive means reasonably available to achieve
the same purpose.
bodies’ exception
Discrimination Act
excuses discrimination, on the basis of any
protected attribute, by voluntary bodies when the body is admitting members, or
is providing
benefits, facilities or services to anyone. The exception does not,
however, apply to a voluntary body’s employment practices.
The intention behind the exception for membership is to allow a voluntary
body to dedicate itself to the interests of people with
a particular attribute,
such as a people of a particular ethnic and cultural background, sexual
orientation, religious belief or
disability. Such an activity is, effectively, a
special measure or conduct for which an exemption from the
Discrimination
can be granted, and so there is no need for an exception. An exemption
gives certainty that the proposed conduct is lawful; when
an exemption has been
granted, it is known that the
Discrimination Act
does not apply to the
conduct, and no complaint of discrimination can succeed.
But if the exception is retained, its current scope – ‘the
admission of people as members of the body’ – is
so broad that it
allows discrimination on the basis of protected attributes that are unrelated to
the organisation’s purpose.
For example, a voluntary body that is
dedicated to film appreciation or fishing can rely on the exception to deny

A preferable approach would reflect that of the Victorian
Opportunity Act
, and allow a voluntary body to exclude from membership a
person who is not a member of the group of people with a protected attribute
whose benefit the body was established.
Provision of services
Discrimination Act
is unique in Australia in allowing voluntary
bodies to discriminate when it provides goods, services and facilities to the
Other anti-discrimination legislation in Australia makes exceptions for
the activities of voluntary bodies, but limits those exceptions
to activities
among and relating to members. There is no apparent rationale for this
overly-broad exception in the ACT.
Submissions
Four of the eight submissions received in relation to this exception support
repealing it in its entirety.
The effect of not having the exception would be that voluntary bodies that
wanted to discriminate would have to apply for an exemption
from the ACT Human
Rights Commission.
In support of its submission, the ACT Human Rights Commission refers to
Jones v The Scout Association of Australia, Australian Capital Territory
Branch Incorporated
which the (then) ACT Discrimination Tribunal said that ‘this exception can
allow bodies to discriminate with impunity’,
which in turn
‘undermines attempts to eliminate discrimination in the ACT and does not
assist efforts to create and maintain
a culture of human rights’.
A confidential submission to LRAC similarly emphasises the discriminatory
nature of the exceptions for voluntary bodies, observing
that ‘[t]hose
people who experience disability discrimination at the hands of these
organisations have little protection under
the current
The submission
also notes the potentially significant costs for complainants who elect to
pursue the matter under the Commonwealth
scheme due to the lack of protection
provided by the ACT
Discrimination Act
. In the submitter’s view,
‘[t]he removal of the exemptions for voluntary organisations would
certainly redress this
particular inequality’.
People With Disabilities ACT and the Welfare Rights and Legal Centre (ACT)
recommend that the scope of the exception be limited so
as only to apply to the
provision of benefits, facilities and services to members of the particular
voluntary body,
and COTA ACT
considers that ‘the ACT Act should be consistent with legislation in other
By contrast, Freedom 4 Faith submits that the exception for voluntary bodies
should be retained in its current form, on the basis
that the exception
‘is an expression of freedom of association, and voluntary groups should
be able to set their own membership

benefits etc in accordance with the intended purpose of the particular
association’.
, an exception for membership should be repealed, and reliance placed on
the provision in the
Discrimination Act
to apply for an exemption. If
contrary to Recommendation 18 a justification defence is not enacted and
exceptions are retained then,
to appropriately confine the circumstances in
which voluntary bodies can discriminate, and to ensure that the approach in the
is consistent with that taken by other Australian jurisdictions, the
exception relating to membership should be limited to allowing
a voluntary body
to exclude from membership a person who is not a member of the group of people
with a protected attribute for whose
benefit the voluntary body was established.
As well, the exception relating to provision of services should be limited to
of services to members of the voluntary body.
Clubs exception
Discrimination Act
deals with ‘clubs’ separately from
‘voluntary bodies’, defining a ‘club’ to be a club that
a liquor licence under the
Liquor Act 2010
. An exception is made
that allows clubs to discriminate on the basis of race, sex, age and disability
when their object is to provide
benefits to people of a stated race (except by
reference to colour), and to people of one sex, of a particular age group, or
have a particular disability.
As is the case with voluntary bodies, the intention behind the exception is
to allow a club to dedicate itself to the interests of
people with a particular
attribute, such as a people of a particular ethnic and cultural background, sex,
age or disability. Such
an activity is, effectively, a special measure or
conduct for which an exemption from the
Discrimination Act
granted, and so there is no need for an exception. It is for this reason that
the Women’s Legal Centre does not support
retaining an exception for
clubs. It considers that ‘if the objects or intent of the club is to limit
membership to persons
of a particular attribute (not necessarily limited to sex,
age, race and disability), an exemption should be sought’.
Dr Asmi Wood concurs, submitting
that clubs should be required to make their case at the ACT Human Rights
Commission using the exemption
If the exception is retained, then there is no reason in principle why the
opportunity to establish an exclusive club should not be
extended to all
attributes. The ACT Human Rights Commission submits that the
Discrimination
should ‘explicitly require a club to show that
they have attempted to improve gender equality, or that it would be
unreasonable to provide equality of gender opportunity because
of the hardship
involved in providing equal
In LRAC’s view
, an exception for clubs should be removed, and
reliance placed on the provision to apply for an exemption. If contrary to
Recommendation
18 a justification defence is not enacted and exceptions are
retained, then it should be extended to any attribute for which the
formed, when it is formed for the benefit of people wit that attribute. An
exception in these terms would meet the ‘reasonable
limits’ test
Human Rights Act
. A desire to ensure that measures are taken to
promote gender equality, and equality on the basis of other attributes would be
by the recommended positive duty, Recommendation 5.1.
Sports exception
Discrimination Act
does not currently cover sport as an area of
activity in its own right. Explicit reference to sport is only in an exception
discrimination in competitive sport when competitors’ strength,
stamina or physique is relevant; the Act assumes that sport
is covered by the
provision of goods, services and facilities.
Submissions received on this issue highlight the discrimination encountered
by people on the basis of their disability, sex, gender
identity and intersex
status in sport, and the need to ensure stronger protection against
discrimination for people with these attributes.
For example, People With
Disabilities ACT notes that participation in sport is a major area in which its
members ‘experience
disadvantage and discrimination’. It considers
that ‘[t]he example of the exclusion of people using hand cycles from
Canberra Marathon is a high profile example of discrimination in participation
in sport’, and added that ‘[t]here
less public instances based on discriminatory attitudes’. In its view,
Discrimination Act
should expressly cover sport and not
assume it is covered under goods, services and facilities. The exception for
sport should be
considerably narrowed so as to only apply to competitive sport
in a way which is necessary to protect the integrity of the
The Women’s Legal Centre (ACT and Region) submits that ‘the
sports exception should not apply as it encourages assumptions
regarding a person’s ability based on gender’.
It cited a case study in which a
teenage girl, who was a skilled footballer and had played at her school for many
years, was unable
to continue playing in her team because of an arbitrary rule
that females were not allowed to continue once they reached a certain
absence of a female football competition in the ACT meant she had to give up her
sport or regularly travel to Sydney to
play in the female competition. In the
Centre’s view, ‘[t]he critical question needs to be focused on a
strength, stamina and physique’; this would remove
considerations of gender or intersex identity and retain the focus on the
ability of players.
The ACT Human Rights Commission submits that exceptions relating to sport
‘must be reconsidered’ in light of ‘attitudinal
changes regarding concepts of binary genders’.
In its opinion, ‘any
exception relating to sporting clubs should be on the grounds of player safety,
perhaps continuing to be
expressed in terms of the importance of separation on
grounds of strength, not on particular attributes’.
As a ‘transitional
matter’, the Commission notes that some consideration may need to be given
to ‘professional sport
having further leeway in this area’; however,
it adds that ‘for many sports, particularly contact
sports, the player safety exception is likely to apply regardless of the
amateur or professional nature of the competition.’
Radium Mardia and Liam McAuliffe highlight the discrimination encountered by
LGBTIQ Australians in sport. In their view, sport ‘is
a place where LGBTIQ
Australians are largely invisible, silent and marginalised’. They submit
that there should be no permanent
sporting exceptions, and that
‘discrimination in sport should separately covered by the Act’, In
their view the Act should
be amended to say that ‘A person must not
discriminate against another person by refusing or failing to select the other
in a sporting team; or by excluding that other person from participating
in a sporting activity.’
Dr Asmi Wood submitted that the exceptions for sport should continue to
apply. For example, he considered that women should not be
required to play five
sets of tennis as male tennis players currently do.
In LRAC’s view
, a blanket gender-based exception for all
competitive sport is inappropriate, particularly for sporting activity that is
professional or elite level, and for sporting activity among children
and young people. Even when ‘strength, stamina or physique’
relevant, it does not rationally follow that assumptions can validly be made
person’s strength,
stamina or physique, regardless of their sex and gender identity. If contrary to
Recommendation 18 a justification
defence is not enacted and exceptions are
retained, then amendments that reflect these considerations would be consistent
with recognition
of intersex and gender identity status in the

, and would meet the ‘reasonable limits’ test under the
Human Rights Act
Exception for ‘genuine occupational
qualifications’
Discrimination Act
currently excuses discriminatory conduct when
any of the attributes of sex, race, disability or age is a ‘genuine
occupational
qualification’. Examples are limiting employment to women
because the job involves entering female change rooms, or limiting
employment to
an Indigenous woman of a particular age when an actor is to be cast in the role
of a person with those attributes.
Submissions were made to the effect that
there are genuine occupational requirements for work in religious organisations
and institutions.
An exception is relied on as a defence, after a complaint has been made. A
genuine occupational qualification for a position, however,
is known in advance,
and when discriminatory conduct can be anticipated, it is commonly the subject
of an exemption application.
An exemption gives certainty that the proposed
conduct is lawful; when an exemption has been granted, it is known that the
Discrimination Act
does not apply to the conduct, and no complaint of
discrimination can succeed.
The Women’s Legal Centre (ACT and Region) submits that this exception
should be removed. It considers that ‘[i]f employment
requires a person to
have a particular attribute, the employer should seek an exemption rather than
relying on the exception’.
The ACT Human Rights
Commission similarly acknowledges there are benefits in replacing this exception
with an exemption, ‘on
the basis that the behaviour is likely to be
anticipated in advance, and it will give all parties greater
certainty’.
Commission is, however, concerned ‘about whether this creates additional
onerous requirements for
employers’.
If the exception were to be retained, the Commission supports the
recommendation by the 2009 Victorian Scrutiny Committee’s
Exceptions and Exemptions to the
Equal Opportunity Act 2010
exception be amended to encompass a test of ‘inherent requirements of the
particular position’. In its report
the Victorian Scrutiny Committee saw
the terminology of ‘inherent requirements’ as involving a narrower
inquiry than
‘genuine occupational requirement’, as the question
shifts to ‘a consideration of what is necessary to be able
to perform the
core elements of the employment, rather than considerations of what may be
considered merely convenient or
The ACT Human Rights Commission further supports the recommendation by the
2009 Victorian Scrutiny Committee that the exception only
apply to the
attributes identified in that Report; the Committee recommended that an
exception for inherent requirements should only
apply to the attributes and the
areas in respect of which it is essential, and listed them by reference to the
Victorian Act as it
then was. Dr Asmi Wood submits that the exception should be
available for all
attributes.
The Mental Health Community Coalition ACT supports retaining the exception
for genuine occupational qualifications, because its sector

be narrowed ‘as one of the measures
to address the level of employment disadvantage experienced by people with

It submits that ‘[t]he experience of people with
disabilities who are seeking employment is that these exceptions are used

view, ‘there should be an obligation on
the employer or prospective

is able to rely on these
exemptions’ and ‘the employer or

In LRAC’s view
, an exception for genuine occupational
qualifications should be removed, and reliance placed on the provision to apply
for an exemption.
If contrary to Recommendation 18 a justification defence is
not enacted and exceptions are retained, then it is LRAC’s view
not necessary or appropriate to amend the exception to
encompass a test of ‘inherent requirements of the particular

unable to do it without adjustments being made (discussed

Discrimination Act

a disability when the employer or prospective employer or qualifying body
‘believes on reasonable grounds’ that the person
is or would be
‘unable to carry out work that is essential to the position
concerned’. This is commonly known as the
requirements’ exception. A relevant consideration in determining whether
an employer, prospective employer
or qualifying body has a reasonable belief
that the person would be unable to carry out essential work is whether that body
has considered
what services or facilities would enable that person to work, as
long as providing those service or facilities would not impose an

In addition, the
Discrimination Act
allows discrimination against a
person with a disability when an employer or prospective employer or qualifying
body ‘believes
on reasonable grounds’ that, to carry out the work,
the person with a disability would require services or facilities, and
those services or facilities would impose an unjustifiable hardship. The
considerations for unjustifiable hardship include
the nature of the benefit or
detriment likely to accrue or be suffered by all people concerned, the nature of
the disability of the
person concerned, and the financial circumstances of, and
estimated amount of expenditure by, the person claiming unjustifiable
In other discrimination legislation in Australia, providing services or
facilities that enable a person with a disability to carry
out work duties,
without causing unjustifiable hardship to the employer, is commonly called
‘making reasonable
adjustments’.
reasonable adjustments can be broader than providing services or facilities as
it anticipates, for example, the possibility
of actively changing the nature of
the duties. A duty to make reasonable adjustment is proposed above,
Recommendation 3.1.
Discrimination Act
creates an exception both for a reasonable
belief in an inability to carry out work, and for when it would cause
unjustifiable hardship
to provide the services or facilities. A different
approach is taken in the Victorian
Equal Opportunity Act
, where there is
an exception for when a person is unable to carry out essential work, but there
is also a requirement that an employer
make reasonable adjustments. The Exposure
Draft of the Commonwealth Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill took a
similar approach.
A duty to make reasonable adjustments is discussed above.
The Women’s Legal Centre (ACT and Region) notes that employers
‘can take a very narrow approach and identify one or two
duties which the
employee is unable to do, therefore allowing termination on this basis’.
Further, it observes that ‘[o]ften
consideration is not even given to the
likely timeframe in which the person will be unable to perform the
submits that the exception for ‘inability to carry out work’
‘shouldn’t enable employers to discriminate
based on arbitrary
assumptions about people’s age, sex or other characteristics as a group,
but should only operate on the
basis of people’s actual abilities as
individuals’.
The point is made above that a duty to make reasonable adjustments seems apt
for attributes other than disability which could otherwise
prevent a person from
carrying out work, such as age, sex, pregnancy, breastfeeding, carer
responsibilities, homelessness and physical
features. There is no reason in
principle for requiring reasonable adjustments only for disability and not for
other protected attributes.
The ‘unjustifiable hardship’
qualification could be retained as a factor to be considered in determining
whether an adjustment
is ‘reasonable’; the ACT Human Rights
Commission emphasises the importance of clarifying ‘how the concepts of
to carry out work, unjustifiable hardship and reasonable adjustment
In LRAC’s view,
if contrary to Recommendation 18 a justification
defence is not enacted and exceptions are retained, then it is LRAC’s view
that the ‘inherent requirements of work’ exception should be made
available for all attributes, but only if there is
at the same time a
requirement to make reasonable adjustments as proposed above, Recommendation 3.
This would be a reasonable limit
on the right to non-discrimination under the
Human Rights Act
and superannuation
Discrimination Act
excuses discriminatory conduct in the terms of
insurance and superannuation, on the basis of all attributes, if the
discrimination
is ‘reasonable in the circumstances, having regard to any
actuarial or statistical data on which it is reasonable ... to rely’.
Other anti-discrimination legislation in Australia, including the Exposure Draft
of the Commonwealth Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination
Bill, is similarly
broad in describing the data, but limits the attributes to which this exception
applies to attributes of sex,
age and disability and, in some cases,
relationship status.
People With Disabilities ACT submits that it ‘is aware that people with
disabilities experience considerable discrimination
in access to employment and
superannuation’. In its view, ‘[t]he exemptions relating to
employment and superannuation
should be amended to limit their scope in relation
to people with disabilities to matters relating to the viability of the
or superannuation fund and the onus of proof should be on the insurer
or superannuation provider’. It considered that ‘[t]he
provision in
the draft Commonwealth Bill is a useful
that provision
was more detailed but, in effect, in substantially the same terms as the current
provision in the
Discrimination Act
The ACT Mental Health Consumer Coalition for the ACT expressed concern about
‘excusing discrimination in relation to insurance
and superannuation as
people with mental illness are widely discriminated against in relation to
insurance’. It acknowledges
that amending the Act ‘may not offer
further support for this particular group’, however, it supports
the attributes on which basis discrimination is
permitted’.
Dr Asmi Wood emphasises that decisions made by insurance companies must be
based on the assessment of the person on the day the contract
was entered
The current exceptions in the
Discrimination Act
for insurance and
superannuation differ in that they require actuarial or statistical data in
relation to insurance, but anticipate
that there may be no such data in relation
to superannuation. That concession may have been appropriate in 1991, but
sufficient time
has passed for the exception in the
Discrimination Act
require actuarial or statistical data in relation to superannuation.
Whether relying on actuarial or statistical data, or other data, the
exceptions for insurance and superannuation in the
Discrimination Act
turn on a test of ‘reasonable in the circumstances’. This is an
imprecise test that is not consistent with the test in
Human Rights Act
for limiting the right to non-discrimination where, as noted above, regard
is had to an inclusive list of considerations to justify
the conduct.
, If contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence is not
enacted and the exceptions for insurance and superannuation are
retained, then
the test for excusing discriminatory conduct should not be mere
‘reasonableness’. Rather it should have
regard to the right to equal
and effective protection against discrimination; the purpose of the
discriminatory conduct and its importance;
the nature of the discriminatory
conduct; the relationship between the discriminatory conduct and its purpose;
and whether there
was any less restrictive means reasonably available to achieve
the same purpose. If an exception is limited in this way it is not,
LRAC’s view, necessary to limit the attributes in relation to which the
exception can operate. When assessing this, there
should be reliance on
actuarial or statistical data for both insurance and superannuation, and only on
actuarial or statistical data
that is relevant to the circumstances.
Domestic duties
Discrimination Act
excuses discriminatory conduct, for all
attributes, when employing a person to carry out ‘domestic duties’
on the premises
where the employer lives. This exception currently exists in
various forms in all Australian anti-discrimination legislation, and
a regulatory dividing line between private and public areas of life. The
exception recognises a person’s right to
choose who will be in their
Dr Asmi Wood submits that this exception should be retained.
LRAC notes that there is currently no limit or consideration of circumstances
attached to the exception. Although the exception recognises
right to privacy by being able to choose who will be in their home, the
circumstances of domestic duties do not
relate to guests, but rather to a formal
arrangement – employment – which is usually subject to
anti-discrimination laws.
As a result, the exception can operate much more
widely than a justifiable limit on the right to non-discrimination under the
Human Rights Act
In LRAC’s view
, if contrary to Recommendation 18, a
justification defence is not enacted and exceptions are retained, the scope of
the excepted
conduct that recognises the right privacy must be a justifiable
limit on the right to non-discrimination. This requires having regard
right to equal and effective protection against discrimination; the purpose of
the discriminatory conduct and its importance;
the nature of the discriminatory
conduct; the relationship between the discriminatory conduct and its purpose;
and whether there
was any less restrictive means reasonably available to achieve
the same purpose.
Recommendation
Recommendation 19.1
Even if, contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence is not
enacted and exceptions are retained, the exception for acts
done under statutory
authority should be repealed and replaced by an exception for an act done under
an order of a court or tribunal
which is mandatory and specific about conduct
that must be performed in the absence of a non-discriminatory
alternative.
Recommendation 19.2
If, contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence is not enacted
and exceptions are retained, then the
Discrimination Act
amended so that the exceptions for religious bodies, educational institutions
and workers are available only for conduct
that can be justified as a reasonable
limit on the right to equal and effective protection against discrimination,
having regard
to the factors set out in
Human Rights2004
Recommendation 19.3
If, contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence is not enacted
and exceptions are retained, then the
Discrimination Act
amended so that the exception for voluntary bodies
i. be limited to allowing exclusion from membership of a person who is not
a member of the group of people with a protected attribute
for whose benefit the
voluntary body was established
ii. be limited to the provision of benefits, facilities or services to
members of the voluntary body.
Recommendation 19.4
Even if, contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence is not
enacted and exceptions are retained, the exception for clubs
should be repealed
and reliance placed on provisions for an exemption. If that recommendation is
not accepted then the
Discrimination Act
should be amended so that
exceptions that allows clubs to limit membership on the basis of race, sex and
disability be extended to
allow clubs to limit membership on the basis of any
protected attribute if the club has as its principal object the provision of
benefits to people who have that attribute.
Recommendation 19.5
If, contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence is not enacted
and exceptions are retained, then the
Discrimination Act
amended so that the exception for sport:
i. is available for discrimination in relation to the exclusion of people
from participation in competitive sporting activity on the
basis of any
ii. is available only when taking into account the strength, stamina or
physique of competitors can be justified as a reasonable limit
on the right to
equal and effective protection against discrimination, having regard to the
factors set out in
Human Rights2004
Recommendation 19.6
If, contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence is not enacted
and exceptions are retained, then:
Discrimination Act
should be amended to repeal the
exceptions for ‘genuine occupational qualifications’ and reliance
placed on provisions
for an exemption, but if an exception for ‘genuine
occupational qualifications’ is to be retained then:
Discrimination Act
should be amended to make a single
provision for an exception for ‘genuine occupational qualifications’
that is available
for all attributes.
Recommendation 19.7
If, contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence is not enacted
and exceptions are retained, then the
Discrimination Act
amended so that:
i. an exception for ‘inability to carry out work’ is available
for all attributes, and
ii. if Recommendations 3.1 and 3.2 (reasonable adjustments) are not
accepted, the exception is subject to a requirement that an employer
prospective employer must make reasonable adjustments (having regard to an
inclusive list of considerations) to accommodate the
needs of a person who would
otherwise, because of a protected attribute, be unable to do the work.
Recommendation 19.8
If, contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence is not enacted
and exceptions are retained, then the
Discrimination Act
amended so that the exception for insurance and superannuation:
i. is available only for conduct that can be justified as a reasonable
limit on the right to equal and effective protection against
discrimination,
having regard to the factors set out in
Human Rights2004
ii. is assessed by reference only to actuarial or statistical data that is
relevant to the circumstances.
Recommendation 19.9
If, contrary to Recommendation 18, a justification defence is not enacted
and exceptions are retained, then the
Discrimination Act
amended so that the exception for domestic duties be available only for conduct
that can be justified as a reasonable limit
on the right to equal and effective
protection against discrimination, having regard to the factors set out in
Human Rights2004
MEASURES (‘MEASURES INTENDED TO ACHIEVE EQUALITY’)
Australian anti-discrimination laws allow discrimination when it is intended
to overcome disadvantage which has been experienced collectively
because of a shared attribute, such as their race, sex, age or disability. Such
an activity is commonly called a ‘special
measure to achieve
equality’ or, more succinctly, a ‘special
The relevant
provision in the
Discrimination Act
is titled ‘Measures intended to
achieve equality’.
Differently from a general positive duty to promote equality as a means of
reducing discrimination (which is recommended above), a
special measure is a
specific activity, measure or program that permits discriminatory conduct in
favour of a group of people to
remedy past
disadvantage.
Discrimination Act
allows such measures for two purposes: either
to ensure that members of the disadvantaged group have equal opportunities with
people, or to give members of the disadvantaged group opportunities to
meet their special needs, but only if it discriminates in
a way that is
reasonable to achieve the purpose. The
Discrimination Act
gives these
examples of measures intended to achieve equality:
● an employer runs a management skills development course for female
employees only, a purpose of which is to ensure that women
opportunities (in this case, for career development) with men.
● a health clinic provides speech therapy for autistic children only, a
purpose of which is to give autistic children access
to a service that meets
their special needs as autistic children.
Discrimination Act
as currently drafted, a measure intended to
achieve equality is an exception to anti-discrimination laws, and so is argued
as a defence
to a claim of discrimination.

and so could perhaps better be
dealt with as an
exemption’.
Commission did, however, question whether this might ‘unreasonably
increase burdens on organisations’.
The Commission also submits that
consideration might be given to ‘whether there should be some limitation
on relying on an
exception, if a party could have anticipated the conduct and
sought an exemption, but failed to do so. In doing so it noted that
‘[t]his would increase the workload of the Commission, which has an
extremely small discrimination law
It is preferable that a special measure not be seen as, primarily, an
exception to discriminatory conduct, but rather as a positive
measure to promote
equality. A special measure promotes substantive equality for people who share a
protected attribute, and, in
that it operates to discriminate positively, it is
a justifiable limit on the right to non-discrimination. It will be known in
that conduct is intended to operate as a special measure and, as for an
exemption, it is desirable that such conduct be the subject
of application,
notification and assessment.
As the Victorian experience indicates, a special measure operates as a type
of exemption, and when an exemption is sought and granted
for conduct that can
properly be described as a special measure, it should be recognised and approved
as a special measure. Differently
from a special measure, therefore, an
exemption may be sought and granted to permit, for example, continuing conduct
that is transitional
towards a non-discriminatory state of affairs, or conduct
that is necessary because of genuine occupational requirements (such as
employing only women to work in a women’s refuge).
In LRAC’s view
Discrimination
should be amended
so that the definition of, and criteria for, measures intended to achieve
equality are consistent with the approach
taken in international human rights
law (eg favourable treatment; consultation, participation), and so that measures
intended to
achieve equality are a stand-alone provision in pursuit of equality
rather than as an exception to unlawful conduct.
Further, special measures should be obtained by a process of application,
notification and scrutiny. Similarly to LRAC’s view
in relation to
exemptions applications, discussed below, treating special measure applications
as a public process would promote
transparency, and would provide the community
with an opportunity to learn about measures to promote equality for particular
in the community.
Recommendation
Recommendation 20.1
Discrimination Act
should be amended so that the provision for
‘measures intended to achieve equality’ is not set out as an
exception to
the Act, but stands alone so that such measures are given their own
status in pursuit of the objects of the Act.
Recommendation 20.2
Discrimination Act
should be amended so that ‘measures
intended to achieve equality’ are defined in terms that are consistent
with the approach
to special measures in international human rights law, in
particular requiring that special measures are
iii. not restrictive of the rights of the affected people and
communities
iv. designed and implemented on the basis of both prior consultation with
affected people and communities and with their active participation.
Recommendation 20.3
Discrimination Act
should be amended to require a person who
wishes to characterise conduct as a ‘measure intended to achieve
to notify the ACT Human Rights Commission of that measure for
its publication before implementing it, but failure to notify does
any later assessment of whether the conduct has the character of a measure
intended to achieve equality.
Exemptions to discrimination laws allow people or organisations to engage in
discrimination on the basis of any attribute. Rather
than relying on an
exception, as a defence, after the conduct has happened, people or organisations
can apply for permission in advance
to engage in discriminatory conduct for a
particular purpose. The ACT Human Rights Commission may grant an exemption for
up to three
years, and the period may be extended. When considering an exemption
application, the Commission must have regard to the need to
promote acceptance
of and compliance with the Act, and, if relevant, the desirability of
discriminatory conduct being permitted to
redress the effects of past
discrimination (that is, a special measure – see above).
Although the
Discrimination Act
identifies these two considerations
that are consistent with non-discrimination and equality aims, these are not
exclusive considerations
and, on its terms, the Act does not prevent exemptions
from being granted for conduct that is contrary to non-discrimination and
equality aims. To date, the ACT Human Rights Commission has considered only two
exemption applications, both of which were to allow
defence companies to
discriminate against workers on the basis of race, so as to comply with
contractual obligations imposed by the
United States of America. The ACT
Commission refused both, but both were granted by the Tribunal on
One has since been
renewed by the ACT
Commission.
Assessment criteria
Radium Mardia and Liam McAuliffe propose an approach to exemptions based on
the current model, but submit that the ACT Human Rights
Commission should be
‘required to ensure that any exemption is for conduct or conditions which
are not inconsistent with the
objects of the legislation’ and to
‘impose conditions that would ensure that the effect of the exemption does
not undermine
the purpose of the
legislation’.
Importantly, however, since the exemption provisions were drafted, the ACT
Human Rights Act
has been enacted. As discussed previously, the
recognises a number of rights including the right to equality and
non-discrimination. In Victoria, the only other Australian jurisdiction
both anti-discrimination and human rights legislation, the anti-discrimination
law requires an exemption decision to be
made by taking account of whether the
proposed exemption is a reasonable limitation on the right to equality. The
Discrimination Act
could similarly require an approach to creating
exemptions that imposes only a reasonable limit on non-discrimination and
People With Disabilities ACT supports this approach and submits that an
exemption ‘should only be granted if it has a legitimate
aim, is necessary
and proportionate and is a reasonable limit on the discrimination and equality
Dr Asmi Wood
agrees that exemption applications should be considered having regard to the
rights to equality and non-discrimination,
but subject to the operation of
s 51xxci and
Constitution
In LRAC’s view
, requiring exemption applications to be assessed
having regard to the justifiability of any limitation on the right to
non-discrimination
would promote both consistency in the way in which
applications are decided and recognition of the importance of the right to equal
and effective protection against discrimination in the
Human Rights
Application process
Submissions support a ‘public and transparent’ exemptions
In Victoria, and
under the Commonwealth race, sex, disability and age discrimination laws,
exemption applications are treated as
a public process, in which the application
is advertised and submissions are sought. This approach was formalised in the
Draft of the Commonwealth Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill,
which treated exemptions as legislative instruments on which
public consultation
was required.
An exemption under the
Discrimination Act
is a notifiable instrument,
however, no public process is required for exemption applications in the ACT.
Discrimination Act
could require a public process for notifying,
considering and deciding an exemption application.
In LRAC’s view
, treating exemption applications as a public
process would promote transparency and provide parties who have an interest in
the application
to make their views known. More generally, it would provide the
community with an opportunity to learn about the application of
anti-discrimination
legislation and the process by which competing interests may
be balanced.
Recommendation
Recommendation 21.1
Discrimination Act
should be amended so that:
i. an exemption is characterised as a justified limitation on the right to
non-discrimination
ii. in exercising the exemption power the ACT Human Rights Commission must
have regard to the same factors that are set out in
Rights Act 2004
(ACT) to justify a limitation on a human right.
Recommendation 21.2
Discrimination Act
should be amended so that an application for
an exemption, or for a further exemption, is publicly notified by the ACT Human
Commission which shall call for and, before deciding the exemption
application, shall receive and consider submissions that address
whether the
exemption should be granted.
VICTIMISATION
In the ACT, the
Discrimination Act
prohibits subjecting a person to
‘any detriment’ because they have taken – or are believed to
be intending to take
– action specified under the Act. For example, a
café owner hears that a female casual employee intends making a sexual
harassment complaint against him, and stops giving her any work. To get work,
the woman feels she has no choice but to say she won’t
complain. There is
an exception in the
Discrimination Act
, which exists in similar terms in
all other anti-discrimination laws, for a claim that ‘is false and not
made honestly’.
A complaint of victimisation can be made whether or not there has been a
complaint made under the
Discrimination Act
, and whether or not a
complaint that has been made is successful.
The reason for victimisation protection is to ensure that a person is not
deterred from pursuing a discrimination complaint for fear
of reprisals or being
disadvantaged. For example, People With Disabilities ACT explain that
‘[t]he real or perceived fear of
victimisation is a major issue for people
with disabilities who encounter discrimination and a major barrier to them in
taking action
to resolve the discrimination either informally by dialogue with
the discriminator or formally by the
Discrimination Act
The ACT Bar Association submit that people should be protected from
victimisation because they use the
Discrimination Act

vexatious grounds, thus causing others
loss, damage or legal costs, should be
liable to pay just compensation or
Dr Asmi Wood
agrees that victimisation should be prohibited, however he considers that
victimisation should be conceived as a broad
common law duty, and not limited
The victimisation provisions in the
Discrimination Act
differ from
anti-discrimination laws in other Australian jurisdictions. For example, while
the provisions in the Act protect a person
who engages in specified conduct,
other anti-discrimination laws in Australia protect a person who engages in
specified conduct,
but also have a ‘catch-all’ provision that
protects a person who does anything in accordance with the anti-discrimination
legislation. The
Discrimination Act
does not have such a
‘catch-all’ provision. The ACT Human Rights Commission highlights
the absence of the catch-all provision,
noting that, as a result, the Act
‘does not cover a situation where a person’s conduct is not
specified, but should,
in principle, be protected, such as telling another
person about their anti-discrimination
Discrimination Act
protects a person because of what they have
done, or are believed to be intending to do, in relation to the Act, however
other anti-discrimination
laws in Australia also protect a person because of
what their associate does. For example, in the café scenario above, the
Discrimination Act
will not cover victimisation of the employee by the
café owner if the victimisation is based on the employee’s partner
complaining about the sexual harassment. Further, while the
Discrimination
protects a person against a detriment that has happened, unlike other
Australian anti-discrimination laws it does not protect people
from the threat
of detriment. For example, in the café example above, the
Discrimination Act
may not cover victimisation by the café owner
if the conduct is only a
to stop giving the employee any work.
Further, the
Discrimination Act
will not cover victimisation by the
café owner if the café owner’s conduct is to stop giving
work to the female
employee’s sister, or to refuse to let her partner into
the café. Protection against threatened detriment was recommended
NSW Law Reform Commission in its 1999 review of the NSW anti-discrimination
People With Disabilities
ACT submitted that ‘[t]he victimisation provisions should include the
threat of detriment and conduct
affecting a relative or
associate’.
Finally, the
Discrimination Act
protects a person because of what they
have done, or are believed to be intending to do. There are similar protections
in other Australian
anti-discrimination legislation. In the café example
Discrimination Act
will not cover
victimisation by the café owner if it is based on a
that the employee has made a sexual harassment complaint against him, even if
she hasn’t done so. Without elaboration, People
With Disabilities ACT does
not support the inclusion of ‘suspicion of
In LRAC’s view
, the Council considers that the
Discrimination
should be amended to include any conduct covered by the Act, the threat
of detriment, and the actions of and detriment to, an associate
of the person.
In LRAC’s view, these changes would extend the coverage of legislation
that is designed to ensure that the
Discrimination Act
is used without
fear, and would bring the
Discrimination Act
into line with other
discrimination legislation in Australia.
Recommendation
Discrimination Act
should be amended so that the protection
against victimisation covers:
i. not only the matters currently listed, but anything done in accordance
with the Act
ii. not only detriment, but also threat of detriment
iii. not only a belief that a person proposes to do something, but also a
belief that a person has done something
iv. not only conduct of and detriment to the person, but also conduct of
and detriment to an associate of the person.
LIABILITY (ACTS OF REPRESENTATIVES)
The common law concept of ‘vicarious liability’ means that an
employer or principal is responsible for what their employees
or agents do in
the course of their duties. All discrimination laws, including the
Discrimination Act
, make employers or principals responsible for the
discriminatory behaviour of their employees or agents. Technically, this
responsibility
is different from vicarious liability, and is more accurately
referred to as ‘attributed
liability’.
Discrimination Act
says that a person is responsible for the
discriminatory conduct of their ‘representative’, acting within
their authority.
Unlike the law of vicarious liability, attributed liability
Discrimination Act
excuses the employer or principal if they
took ‘all reasonable steps’ to prevent the conduct. However, merely
a policy will not be sufficient, and an employer must ensure that its
policies are communicated
effectively.
The size and
resources of an employer are relevant, so that larger employers will be expected
to do more than smaller ones to rely
successfully on the
Discrimination Act
, liability can be attributed only to a
‘representative’ who is acting ‘within the scope of [their]
actual or apparent
authority’. The Commonwealth
Discrimination
, for example, takes a broader approach and attributes liability for
discriminatory conduct that occurs ‘in connection with
the employment of
the employee or with the duties of the agent as an
The Northern Territory Act sets out considerations to assess whether
‘all reasonable steps’ were taken by the person (or
organisation) to
whom liability would be attributed,
(a) the provision of anti-discrimination training;
(b) the development and implementation of an equal employment opportunity
management plan;
(c) the publication of an anti-discrimination policy;
(d) their financial circumstances; and
(e) the number of workers and agents.
Another approach, taken in the Exposure Draft of the Commonwealth Human
Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill, is to excuse the employer
or principal if
they ‘took reasonable precautions, and exercised due diligence’ to
avoid the discriminatory conduct.
It is possible that ‘exercising due
diligence’ requires more than simply taking steps and extends, for
example, to monitoring
and assessing compliance with policies and training.
Dr Asmi Wood submits that the attributed liability provisions should include
a due diligence test, and the employer should automatically
be included as a
party to the action. He notes that it is an inherent duty on employers that
there is a positive duty of due diligence.
He also submits that consideration be
given to exceptions for small businesses.
In LRAC’s view
, an attributed liability provision encourages
employers and principals to take positive steps to prevent unlawful conduct. It
desirable to make clear what steps can be taken to prevent unlawful
Recommendation
Recommendation 23.1
Discrimination Act
should be amended so that the taking of
‘all reasonable steps’ is assessed by reference to an inclusive list
of factors,
such as those set out in section 105 of the
Anti-Discrimination
Recommendation 23.2
Discrimination Act
should be amended to require not only that
the person took all reasonable steps to prevent the
representative
from engaging in the conduct, but also that the person exercised due diligence
to avoid the discriminatory conduct.
ENFORCEMENT
AND COMPLIANCE
mechanisms for enforcing the
Discrimination Act
are in the ACT
Rights Commission Act
, as are the mechanisms for enforcing some other ACT
laws. Those mechanisms, and responsibility for them, are currently being
by the ACT Government. To avoid LRAC’s review of
Discrimination Act
overlapping with that review of responsibilities, the
issues below are not directly related to the discrimination provisions in the
Human Rights Commission Act
. Instead, the issues have been expressed at a
level of principle, so as to inform a possible redesign of responsibilities
Human Rights Commission Act
Discrimination Act
is currently enforced through the following
process, set out in the ACT
Human Rights Commission
1. a person who believes that they are the victim of discrimination,
harassment, vilification or victimisation must make a written
complaint (but is
entitled to help in putting it in writing);
2. the person who complains (the complainant) and the person or organisation
they complain about (the respondent) must make that complaint
to a statutory
body that may initiate a confidential conciliation process to try to reach an
agreed resolution; and
3. if the complaint is not resolved the complainant has the option of running
a case against the respondent in a tribunal as a matter
accountability.
This process is based on principles of individual responsibility,
confidentiality, mandatory statutory oversight, and public accountability.
Individual responsibility
The principle of individual responsibility in enforcing anti-discrimination
laws has been widely and persistently criticised for asking
too much of a person
who is a victim of discrimination, harassment, vilification or
victimisation.
It is often
beyond the financial, personal and
emotional resources of a victim to pursue the person or organisation alleged
to have discriminated; by definition a person who complains
of discrimination is
usually in a less powerful position than the person or organisation they are
complaining against.
The conciliation process has a high rate of success, and is a valuable means
of providing redress for discrimination complaints, and
for exploring and
achieving solutions to systemic issues that are raised by a complaint. At the
same time, it is not a sufficient
guarantee of the human right to equal and
effective protection against discrimination to protect it only by the complaint
of a person
denied that right.
Possible additional avenues for redress include allowing a person to give
permission to another person or organisation, or enabling
a statutory body to
pursue a complaint about the conduct complained of. To an extent, these
additional avenues for redress are already
available in the ACT: another person
can seek approval to complain on behalf of a person who is unable to complain,
and the ACT Human
Rights Commission can initiate a complaint when a person could
do so, but has not. There are, however, limitations on these: the
Commission’s approval is needed for another person to complain on behalf
of a person; only another person, and not an organisation,
can complain on
behalf of a person; and a complaint initiated by the Commission cannot be taken
to the tribunal (ACAT) as a matter
of public accountability.
The principle of individual responsibility has also been criticised for
focussing only on the individual instance, and not taking
account of what may be
widespread or systemic reasons for the conduct complained
Possible alternatives
include allowing a statutory body such as the ACT Human Rights Commission to
conduct a wider inquiry arising
from the conduct complained of, and to allow an
individual complaint to be treated as one that is representative of broader
To an extent, these alternatives are already available in the ACT, where
a complaint can be treated as a ‘representative’
complaint under
certain conditions; the Commission can initiate a complaint when it is satisfied
that ‘it is in the public
interest’ to do so and can make
recommendations to third parties arising from its consideration of a complaint.
These alternatives
are, however, limited: if a representative complaint is taken
to ACAT, the tribunal does not have the power to make any orders that
beyond a remedy to an individual complainant, a complaint initiated by the
Commission cannot be taken to ACAT, and recommendations
to third parties are not
easily enforceable. These limitations could be addressed by enhancing the powers
of the Commission and ACAT,
discussed below, and by allowing a complaint
initiated by the ACT Human Rights Commission to be taken to ACAT.
Overall, an alternative or additional principle on which to base enforcement
Discrimination Act
could be that of state responsibility. For
example, the introduction of a positive duty, discussed above, would lead to a
role for the government as an active proponent of non-discriminatory
conduct, shifting the focus to some extent from individual responsibility
enforcement.
In LRAC’s view,
as a matter of principle, the right to equal and
effective protection against discrimination in the ACT in the
Human Rights
should be protected by more than merely enabling the complaint of a
person denied that right, and procedures should be established
to relieve the
burden on individuals and to establish broad and well-resourced responsibilities
for protecting that right. LRAC notes
the necessary resource implications in
enhancing the powers of the Commission and ACAT.
Confidentiality
The principle of confidentiality in enforcing anti-discrimination laws allows
a person to complain under the Act without the burden
of publicity and the fear
of public criticism. Confidentiality can, however, make it difficult to achieve
attitudinal change that
would come through publicising the type of conduct that
occurs and the way it is resolved: it is difficult to use real examples of
complaints and their outcomes that will help people understand their rights, to
give indicative information about the possible outcomes
of a discrimination
complaint, and to use information about previous conciliated outcomes to assist
parties in coming to an agreement.
Two submissions to the inquiry directly addressed this issue. The ACT Human
Rights Commission endorses an earlier recommendation made
to the Federal
Government by the Discrimination Law Experts’ Group that ‘the
content, conduct and results of a conciliation
process should be presumptively
confidential, but that parties can agree to disclose
information’.
Disclosure may, for example, be for the Commission’s education and
promotion purposes, or may be for a party to publicise the
outcome of a
The Commission also supports ‘an amendment that would allow access to
otherwise confidential information for research purposes,
subject to the
research being approved by an institutional ethics committee’. To assist
in this process, the Commission suggests
that ‘complaints-related
information could be preserved as archival
information’.
Dr Asmi Wood considers that the issue of confidentiality should be
discretionary, and based on a public interest test. In his view,
parties should
be given the option of submitting their
preference.
In LRAC’s view,
as a matter of principle, complaints under the
Discrimination Act
should be presumptively confidential to enable victims
to make a complaint without fear of adverse consequences. Parties should,
be permitted to consent to certain confidential information being made
public by the Commission, and this preference should be taken
into account by
the relevant decision-maker. Consideration should also be given to making
confidential information available for
research purposes, subject to an ethics
approval process.
Mandatory statutory oversight
Direct access to the tribunal
Currently in the ACT, complaints of discrimination must be made to the ACT
Human Rights Commission. The Commission may initiate a
confidential conciliation
process to try to reach an agreed resolution, and if the complaint is not
resolved the complainant has
the option of running a case against the respondent
in a tribunal as a matter of public accountability. In comparison to litigation,
conciliation is an accessible and low cost option. The principle of mandatory
oversight by Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissions
has, however, been
criticised for creating duplication and delays and being overly rigid in
preventing a complainant and/or respondent
from having direct access to the
public accountability
A possible alternative is to allow a complainant and/or respondent direct
access to ACAT. Victoria, for example, has allowed direct
access to its tribunal
(Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal) since 2010. In Victoria in
2013/2014, 1057 complaints were made
to the statutory body (the Victorian Equal
Opportunity and Human Rights Commission) and about 70 complaints were made
directly to
the tribunal.
Submissions to LRAC on this issue emphasise the importance of both
flexibility and accessibility respectively. For example, the ACT
Bar Association
submits that people should have ‘their free choice of avenue to complain
or proceed’. In its view, ‘[c]laims
for relief under the Act should
be dealt with by the ordinary Courts and Tribunals, which ought to be able to
order or suggest mediation
or conciliation wherever this is
appropriate’.
Wood considers that there should be a presumption that matters go to the Human
Rights Commission, however, a test of reasonableness
based on subjective issues
should be applied in the event that one or both parties wish to bypass the
Commission.
The ACT Human Rights Commission acknowledges the arguments in favour of
direct access, however it submits that ‘the free, complaint
service provided by the Commission outweighs these
considerations’.
considers that ‘the addition of further legal supports through Community
Legal Centres and/or the addition of positive duties
not to discriminate’
would address concerns that aggrieved persons may feel isolated after a failed
conciliation at the
Commission.
If the Act is amended to allow complainants to directly access ACAT, the
Commission submits that its role ‘would need to move
more to one of
systemic oversight’. In its view, this might include ‘more resources
for own-motion investigations and
industry-based education and compliance
activities (akin to WorkCover), and would likely require new resources for the
Commission’.
In LRAC’s view,
as a matter of principle, complainants should be
able to elect whether to complain to the ACT Human Rights Commission, which
the less costly option of conciliation, or to apply directly to ACAT
which is a forum of public accountability.
Investigation powers
It is central to a statutory agency’s capacity to oversee compliance
Discrimination Act
that the agency has powers of investigation,
which include a power to obtain information and documents. The ACT Human Rights
already has that
but the usefulness of
what it obtains is limited because information and documents it obtains in this
way are not allowed to be used
in any subsequent legal proceedings. A possible
alternative is to allow information and documents obtained in this way to be
only in proceedings under
Discrimination Act
but not for any other
Enforcement of recommendations
It is central to a statutory agency’s capacity to oversee compliance
Discrimination Act
that the agency’s powers are
enforceable. Although the ACT Human Rights Commission can make recommendations
to third parties
arising from its consideration of a
the enforcement
mechanism for failure to comply with those recommendations requires a formal
prosecution,
and has not
been used. A possible alternative is the use of civil penalty provisions. LRAC
notes the necessary resource implications
in enabling the Commission to engage
in enforcement procedures.
The ACT Human Rights Commission also notes the complexity associated with the
Human Rights Commission Act
, which states that a conciliated agreement of
a discrimination complaint ‘is enforceable as if it were an order of the
complicated by the
ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
provides that a money order or non-money order made by ACAT is taken to have
been filed in the Magistrate’s Court for
enforcement under the
Procedures Rules 2006
. As the Commission explains, this suggests that a breach
of a conciliated agreement may have to be enforced in the Magistrates Court,
with a significant cost implications for parties, possibly preventing them from
utilising the ‘lower cost, more accessible

Recommendation 24.1
As a matter of principle, the right to equal and effective protection

individuals and to establish broad and well-resourced responsibilities for
protecting that right.

As a matter of principle, the ACT Human Rights Commission should have the
power to pursue civil penalties for failure to comply with
its statutory power
to make recommendations.
accountability
The principle of public accountability for discriminatory conduct through a
tribunal hearing has not been subject to criticism itself,
but aspects of ACAT
process have been subject to criticism, and these are discussed below.
At present, ACAT is not required to give reasons unless requested, and is not
required to make publicly available any reasons that
are provided in this way.
As a result, ACAT publishes very little public guidance on how the
Discrimination Act
can be applied and should be interpreted. An option is
to require ACAT to publish reasons in all matters arising under the
Discrimination Act
, although this is not a matter LRAC has raised with
All submissions that addressed this issue considered that ACAT should publish
reasons in matters under the
Discrimination Act
. Dr Asmi Wood considers
that reasons should be published in public interest
while the ACT Human
Rights Commission submits that it is ‘vitally important’ that
written decisions be published in all
noting the current
lack of jurisprudence on the application of the
Discrimination Act
Freedom 4 Faith emphasises the importance of published reasons ‘to help
organisations within the ACT to understand the scope
and application of the
anti-discrimination laws to which they are subject, especially given the
vagueness of the current
legislation’.
In LRAC’s view,
as a matter of principle, ACAT should publish
reasons in all matters heard under the
Discrimination Act
. This would
promote certainty and consistency in the application of the Act.
Burden of proof
A complainant is currently responsible for demonstrating that the respondent
treated them unfavourably because of a protected attribute.
It can, however, be
difficult for the complainant to establish the reasons for the
respondent’s conduct, because they cannot
know what was in the mind of the
respondent. One possible alternative is to require the complainant to show that
they were treated
unfavourably and then to require the respondent to show that
the treatment was not for discriminatory reasons. This is the approach
the Commonwealth
Fair Work Act.
A slightly different approach is to require the complainant to show that they
were treated unfavourably
to provide evidence from which the court
could decide that the respondent treated them unfavourably because of a
protected attribute.
The respondent would then be required to show that the
treatment was not for discriminatory reasons. This approach was proposed in
Exposure Draft of the Commonwealth Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill,
and is the approach taken in the UK, Canada, US
and European Union.
Freedom 4 Faith did not express a preference for a particular model, however,
it submits that ‘at the very least the applicant
needs to prove that they
have a protected attribute and that they have been subject to unfavourable
treatment’. In its view,
[t]hese are within the applicant’s
capacities to
demonstrate’.
The ACT Human Rights Commission supports an approach similar to that taken in
the Commonwealth
Fair Work Act.
In its view, ‘the Act should be
amended to introduce a presumption that action was taken for the reason alleged,
respondent proves otherwise. To ‘prove otherwise’, the
respondent would prove that the alleged discriminatory conduct
proportionate means of achieving a legitimate end or purpose’.
Dr Asmi Wood similarly submits
that ‘a reverse onus should apply after the prima facie case is made out
by the complainant’.
Women With Disabilities ACT and People With Disabilities ACT advocate a
‘shifting burden of
in which the
burden would rest ‘with the party best able to satisfy it and ... can
shift if necessary to accommodate revelations
which come to light in the
investigation or hearing of the
In support of
its submission, People With Disabilities ACT explains that ‘[p]eople with
disabilities often cannot make complaints
of discrimination or have those
complaints resolved because the evidence of discrimination is not within their
control but rests
with the alleged
discriminator’.
Women With Disabilities ACT draws particular attention to matters involving
multiple discrimination, and the importance of ensuring
evidentiary burden of proof should be proportionately lowered to reflect the
exponential impact that unlawful multiple
discrimination has on an
individual’. Citing the Australian Human Rights Commission’s
submission to the inquiry into
the proposed consolidation of Commonwealth
discrimination law, it considers that a shifting burden of proof ‘reflects
a well-established
common law principle that evidence should be weighed
according to the capacity of the party to produce it’.
In LRAC’s view,
complainants should be required to demonstrate
that they were treated unfavourably. The burden of proof should then shift to
respondent to demonstrate that the person was not treated unfavourably
because of a protected attribute. This would address the current
encountered by complainants in being required to demonstrate what was in the
mind of the complainant at the time of the
unfavourable treatment.
Representative complaints
A criticism of the process of public accountability under the
Discrimination Act
, noted above, is that ACAT does not have the power to
make any orders that go beyond a remedy to an individual complainant. This
that even if a representative complaint is taken to ACAT, the tribunal cannot
make representative orders or corrective orders.
Possible alternatives include
expanding the range of orders that ACAT is empowered to make, such as enabling
ACAT to recommend changes
to policy and practice or systemic responses to
discrimination to be monitored by the ACT Human Rights Commission.
The ACT Human Rights Commission submitted that ‘the
Discrimination
should be amended to enable the filing of representative
complaints’ and that ‘ACAT should be able to award damages in
Compensatory damages
A common criticism of damages awards under anti-discrimination laws
throughout Australia is that they are inconsistent and unpredictable.
confusion over what principles and considerations should guide the assessment of
damages for unlawful conduct under anti-discrimination
law. This uncertainty
can, for example, hinder constructive attempts to resolve matters in advance of
a tribunal hearing. An alternative
approach is to provide legislative guidance
assessing damages.
This would promote greater certainty in the assessment of
compensatory damages.
On the topic of damages, the ACT Human Rights Commission noted that
anti-discrimination complainants have typically been poorly compensated
comparison to parties involved in claims of other types of wrongful conduct. The
Commission also submitted that it ‘may
be beneficial’ to amend the
Act to allow the ACT Human Rights Commission ‘to intervene as an
intervener or amicus at
the end of a matter to make submissions only on damages,
as the Victorian Commission has routinely
ACAT observed that ‘complainants often have difficulty understanding
what compensatory damages are and understanding that they
may need to provide
evidence to facilitate assessment of damages they seek, even when detailed
information is provided about that
at directions
Recommendation
Recommendation 25.1
As a matter of principle, ACAT should be required to publish reasons in
matters in matters decided under the
Discrimination Act
Recommendation 25.2
As a matter of principle, in an ACAT hearing, once a complainant has
established that they have been treated unfavourably, a respondent
required to show that the protected attribute or attributes alleged by the
complainant were not a reason for that treatment.
Recommendation 25.3
As a matter of principle, in response to a successful representative
complaint, ACAT should have the power to recommend that certain
action be taken,
such as monitoring by the ACT Human Rights Commission.
Recommendation 25.4
As a matter of principle, the
Discrimination Act
should specify the
factors to be taken into account when assessing damages.
Recommendation 25.5
As a matter of principle, the ACT Human Rights Commission should be
empowered to intervene to make submissions on damages.
