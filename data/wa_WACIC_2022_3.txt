for Decision
application dated 25 June 2020 Paul Daniel McLernon (the applicant)
claimed compensation for injuries he suffered as a consequence
of an offence
committed by Brett Sewell (the offender) on 11 September 2018 (the
application was made pursuant to
Criminal Injuries
Compensation
(the Act). This section authorises an assessor
to award compensation if satisfied the injury claimed occurred as a consequence
the commission of a proved offence.
of the Act defines a
proved offence as a crime, misdemeanour or simple offence of which a person has
been convicted.
The Offence
applicant was born on 19 May 1968 and is currently aged 53 years. The
circumstances of the offence were as follows. The applicant
and offender worked
together at Avon Valley Beef. The applicant was employed in a management role.
The offender was verbally abusing
colleagues at the workplace and the applicant
approached him to discuss his behaviour. The applicant spoke to the offender in
cool room, advising this was the third time his behaviour had resulted in
such a discussion and he needed to "pull his head in" or
would have to
leave. The offender moved towards the applicant and struck several blows to the
applicant's head, before trying to
choke the applicant.
offender was convicted of unlawful assault in the Magistrates Court at Midland
on 11 September 2018. I am satisfied a proved
offence as defined in
the Act was constituted.
support of the application, the applicant provided a copy of his police
statement dated 13 September 2018; a Police Information
Report, a quote for
dental treatment from Aria Dental, Notices of Assessment of Taxation for the
financial years ending 30 June 2018
to 30 June 2020, a report from
Dr Michael Zaninovich, dentist, dated 5 November 2021 (which was
accompanied by several photographs
of the applicant's teeth), and an undated
victim impact statement. I identify these documents, where relevant, in more
detail below.
obtained the Police Brief. The Incident Report (120918 0930 81979)
described the applicant's injuries as "three missing teeth
on lower jaw, one
loose tooth, bruised and swollen lower lip, left eye swollen and red, left arm
sore, chest sore and face sore".
The photographs of the applicant show several
missing teeth.
issued a notice pursuant to
section 19(1)(a)
of the Act to the worker's
compensation insurer, QBE. The documents produced in response to that notice
indicate $975 was paid for
medical reports in the course of the claim which was
ultimately resolved by way of lump sum payment to the applicant in the amount
$28,000. The file contained a number of medical reports to which I refer to
his witness statement to police dated 13 September 2018 the applicant
described his injuries as:
I now have three lower teeth that have been knocked out and one that is very
loose. I have a bruised and swollen bottom lip, my
left eye is swollen and red,
my left arm is sore, my chest is sore from where Bret knelt on me and my face is
applicant described the impact of his injuries in the Victim Impact Statement.
The applicant explained he was made redundant
from Avon Valley Beef on
19 May 2019, some eight months after the incident. He was able to gain
further employment promptly but
due to not receiving regular wages from that
employer he sought new employment. The applicant experienced difficulty in
employment which he attributed to his appearance, in particular his
missing teeth, stating:
The search for employment was challenging, while I would get contacted by
numerous potential employers seeking to employ me, I did
not get much interest
from the same employers once we had face to face meetings. Our telephone
conversations usually went well and
the potential employers and me would
organize in person meetings at coffee shops or bars. After the meetings, I
would not hear from
the potential employers, and I heard from their associates
that it was all due to my physical appearance; loss of teeth is often
with drug addiction which would explain why no potential employer would contact
me after out face-to-face meetings.
applicant described the financial hardship he experienced as a result of his
employer, Crown Valley, owing him back pay and stated
upon settlement of his
workers compensation claim arising from the offence he used the monies received
to pay debts and living expenses.
He did not apply the portion of the
settlement he received for dental treatment to such treatment. As a result of
the financial
difficulties, the applicant described becoming anxious and
depressed. He undertook a landscaping job for his landlord in exchange
rent. The applicant advised he sought employment in roles where his physical
appearance did not matter and, after obtaining
a forklift licence, obtained
employment. He was subsequently promoted to warehouse manager and then
operations manager. He attributed
the delay in him being able to obtain
employment in a management role to his physical appearance after the offence and
an ongoing impact on his mood.
applicant provided his Taxation Notice of Assessment (NOA) for the year ended
2018, disclosing earnings in the amount of $105,580
(gross) and his NOA for the
year ended 2019, disclosing earnings in the amount of $131,316 (gross). The
applicant's solicitors advised
the applicant's earnings in the year ended 2019
included a redundancy payment but did not specify the amount of such payment.
applicant's NOA for the year ended 2020 disclosed earnings of $16,649
(gross). The applicant was made redundant from his employment
with Avon Beef in
May 2019 and the applicant's earnings in the financial year ended 2020 clearly
indicate the impact of his inability
to secure stable employment after the
redundancy, as referred to in his Victim Impact Statement.
documents obtained from QBE Insurance in response to the notice issued pursuant
of the Act indicate on 29 October 2018 QBE Insurance accepted
liability for the applicant's claim with respect to medical expenses
documents also included a settlement agreement indicating the applicant resolved
his claim for workers compensation for
$28,000 and also a claim payment summary
indicating additional payments of $975 for dental reports were made by QBE. The
agreement does not provide any itemisation of the lump sum payment of
$28,000 which is described under the Memorandum of Release
and Settlement as
being a "full and complete discharge of his present and future claims against
the Employer in respect of or arising
out of the Injury and/or the Accident,
including weekly payments of compensation and medical and other expenses
provided for under
applicant's treating dentist, Dr Michael Zaninovich, provided a report to
QBE Insurance dated 1 October 2018. This report
Mr Paul McLernon has a significant vulnerability to gum disease and has lost
significant bone support around the remaining dentition.
The teeth are
significantly infected periodontally; resulting in mobility of the teeth, the
assumed injury at work would have easily
avulsed and damaged the teeth due to
their high level of fragility due to this pre-existing disease.
The injury at work has accelerated the need for treatment, although the teeth
inevitably would be scheduled for extraction and replacement
due to their
advanced state of disease
If the work place incident did not occur, the damaged teeth would still have
required treatment. The treatment of choice would have
been extraction.
The work place injury, as mentioned, has only accelerated the need for treatment
immediately to eliminate the presence of pain.
It is likely Mr Paul McLernon
has experienced pain and discomfort from the lower dentition over the previous
years. [My emphasis]
October 2018 Dr Daniel Abbondanza, dentist, provided a report to QBE
Insurance stating:
The issue with Mr McLernon is that, given his current oral condition as
well as a host of modifying factors, his remaining lower
teeth are in a poor
state and will ultimately need extraction..
Without the reported incident the
teeth would ultimately suffer the same fate. The reported trauma would merely
have hastened the
. . . From the radiograph it is more than highly likely due to the pre-existing
nature of periodontal disease these teeth were previously
loose and it is highly
unlikely that trauma would make all the teeth loose. Normally with these
traumatic injuries the trauma is
focused in a region more limited to where his
remaining teeth are situated. [My emphasis]
a further report addressed to QBE Insurance dated 8 July 2019,
Dr Abbondanza commented:
The previous dental records show that Mr McLernon has been undergoing implant
therapy to his upper jaw as early as 2015. It appears
that 7 dental implants
were placed and at a later stage 3 were lost, leaving him with 4 upper dental
implants. From the original
plan there is some mention that Paul was to receive
some dental implants in the lower back jaw.
In essence, the fact remains that his lower teeth are in a poor state, the
incident has hastened the need for treatment but not changed
Dr Abbondanza
provided various treatment options for the applicant:
Periodontal
therapy in the lower jaw, root canal therapy, crown on tooth 46 and provision of
a partial denture at a cost of $6,000;
of all remaining teeth and provision of a removeable denture at a cost of
of all remaining teeth and provision of 2-3 implants to support a lower
removeable denture at a cost of $15,000; or
of all remaining teeth and provision of 4-5 implants to support a fixed implant
bridge at an approximate cost of $20,000 to
Dr Abbondanza
expressed a concern given the applicant's significant risk factors of smoking,
periodontal disease and previous failed
implants any further treatment which
included implants or saving of his teeth will most likely lead to early failure
of treatment
and lead to him wearing dentures.
applicant provided a further medical report from Dr Michael Zaninovich of
Aria Dental, dated 5 November 2021. Dr Zaninovich
reported the
applicant had first attended Aria Dental in December 2014 (some four years prior
to the offence) at which time it was
noted he had dental decay, dental
infections, missing teeth, a smoking habit, compromised plaque control and
periodontal disease.
The radiographic records show the prognosis of his teeth
was significantly compromised. In 2015 his remaining upper teeth were
and implant fixtures placed in his upper jaw to fabricate an implant supported
prosthesis to replace his upper teeth. It
was reported the applicant did not
teeth between 2015
and the offence. The applicant returned to Aria Dental on
11 September 2018 (the day of the offence) and it was noted he had numerous
infections around the upper implant fixtures, his plaque control was suboptimal
and he had dental decay and infections in his lower
teeth. The lower anterior
teeth were noted to be mobile and the applicant was missing a number of lower
teeth. The applicant advised
he had not worn an upper denture between 2015 and
the offence due to a severe gag reflex.
respect to the loss of the applicant's lower teeth, Dr Zaninovich
In my opinion, a traumatic episode could easily have dislodged the lower front
teeth, and I cannot confirm the actual cause of the
loss of teeth apart from the
fact they were missing when he presented to Aria Dental on
of September 2018. The loss of the anterior teeth
could have occurred from a number of reasons. An injury to the area would
caused the dislodgement of the lower teeth,
however his dental health
prior to the injury was already grossly inadequate and subsequently the trauma
did not further exacerbate
his dental disease and condition. It eliminated
active infections from his lower jaw. Loss of the infected teeth subsequently
the bone and tissues to heal more favourably
As I wrote to QBE in 2008 (
), the mobility of the lower teeth was
already significant. It is highly probably that these would have been lost in
the short term
future, however the reported trauma would have accelerated this
Subsequently, in my opinion, I do not believe the assault on the day of the
injury was the only contributing reason to the loss of
the teeth. Instead his
risk factors including a significant smoking habit, advanced gum disease, dental
neglect and compromised
plaque control are factors that would also have
contributed to the loss of his lower teeth
[My emphasis]
relation to the impact upon the applicant from loss of teeth, Dr
Zaninovich commented:
Mr McLernon did not have any teeth in his upper jaw for many years and was not
prepared to stop smoking in order to maximise the
success of any dental care
that could be provided to him. Since he did not return for the teeth following
implant replacement in
2015, I would assume that he was able to function without
his teeth. Mr McLernon did not seem too concerned with his lack of teeth
would assume his dental treatment needs (despite any trauma) is low.
respect to his future treatment expenses, the applicant provided a treatment
plan from Aria Dental dated 11 September 2018 in
the amount of $19,071 for
treatment of
teeth 32 and 42 (lower lateral
incisors) and tooth 41 (lower central incisor).
Method of assessment
of the Act sets out the general powers of an assessor. It provides 'on
application in respect of injury suffered by a victim as
a consequence of the
commission of an offence, an assessor may award such compensation that the
assessor is satisfied is just for
the injury and for any loss also suffered'.
of the Act, 'satisfied' means 'satisfied on the
balance of probabilities'.
assessing the amount of compensation, the court should have regard solely to the
injury suffered by the applicant in consequence
of the commission of the
offence. The amount of compensation is not to be fixed as punishment of the
offender or as an expression
of sympathy for the
correct approach to adopt in assessing the amount of compensation under the Act
is to apply the ordinary tortious principles
for assessment of damages, subject
to the limitations imposed by the definitions of 'injury' and 'loss' in the Act,
and to the jurisdictional
limit of the
Assessment of the applicant's claim
Assessment of "Injury"
of the Act a victim who suffers injury as a consequence of
the commission of a proved offence may apply for compensation for the
any loss suffered. 'Injury' is defined in
of the Act as 'bodily
harm, mental and nervous shock, or pregnancy'.
amount of damages for injury must be fair and reasonable compensation for the
injuries received by the applicant and the disabilities
caused, having regard to
current general ideas of fairness and
moderation.
amount must be proportionate to the particular situation of the
considered the information available to me, I found the applicant suffered from
bruising and contusions to his bottom lip,
left eye and tenderness to his left
arm, chest and face. Three of the applicant's teeth, being teeth 32 and 42
(lower lateral incisors)
and tooth 41 (lower central incisor) were knocked
out by the offender.
applicant provided no medical evidence with respect to any psychological
symptoms. In his report dated 1 October 2018, Dr Zaninovich,
reported the applicant 'did appear to be genuinely upset and concerned about his
lower dentition" on 11 September 2018.
In his Victim Impact Statement the
applicant described psychological symptoms, however these related primarily to
the impact of
his employment difficulties, with the applicant
commenting:
I was struggling to pay my bills and financially support my family. I was
anxious and depressed which eventually took a toll on
my family and friends. As
such, my family and I did not have a pleasant Christmas and I could notice the
heartache that my dire
financial situation had on my teenage daughter.
Since the assault, my employment options have been very limited, and I have been
unable to secure a position similar to the once
) I had at Avon
Valley Beef due to my physical appearance. Despite my extensive experience as a
general manager, I was not considered
for managerial roles due to my physical
appearance. I have experienced substantial financial burden from the same which
to recover from. I still look the same as I did after the assault, and
the repercussions thereof are still affecting me to this
day both mentally and
physically.
accept the applicant experienced some psychological symptoms arising from the
incident, comprising his initial concern over his
dental injuries and then the
impact on his physical appearance. However, according to the Victim Impact
Statement the greatest impact
on the applicant's psychological state was from
his financial situation when he was unable to secure stable employment after his
redundancy.
into account the applicant's physical and psychological symptoms, I assess
$15,000 an appropriate award for injury.
Loss of earnings
applicant's claim for loss of earnings is based upon the difficulty he had
obtaining employment which he attributed to his physical
appearance due to
missing teeth. In considering the claim for loss of earnings two issues
the loss of earnings directly caused by the applicant's injury;
the applicant fail to mitigate his loss by having his teeth repaired.
applicant is able to claim for loss of earnings if he can establish the loss of
earnings suffered was "as a direct consequence
of the injury
[2021] WADC 64
, Lemonis DCJ stated:
As can be seen, this definition includes the word direct before consequence,
which word does not appear before consequence in
The word direct (or
directly) appears in the other paragraphs comprising the definition of loss in
At first blush, it is unclear whether the introduction of a qualifying
word such as direct in
results in there being a higher threshold to
establish compensation for loss from injury within the meaning of

the commission of an offence within the meaning of
In any event, even if
it does result in a higher threshold, I consider that threshold would only reach
the height of the injury being
the substantive (or dominant) cause, as opposed
to a material cause. In my view, it would be contrary to the compensatory
of the legislation to require that the injury be the sole cause of

secured further employment and continued working until September 2019 when
he ceased employment for reasons unrelated to
his injury. The applicant's claim
for loss of earnings is not due to an inability to work but upon the difficulty
the applicant
had obtaining secure employment subsequent to his redundancy in
May 2019, which he attributed to his physical appearance due to missing
teeth. On 18 June 2021, 28 June 2021, 1 July 2021 and
15 September 2021 I requested the case manager write to the applicant's
seeking evidence in support of the claim for loss of earnings.
applicant provided no evidence of any jobs he had applied for, the interviews he
had undertaken or any statements from the "associates"
referred to in his victim
impact statement who allegedly advised him his employment applications were
unsuccessful due to the appearance
of his teeth. It is open for me to find the
reason the applicant did not obtain employment was due to reasons other than his
applicant has a duty to mitigate his or her loss. In

[250] Derrick DCJ summarised the principles as:
The principles relating to mitigation of loss are well established. The burden
of proving that a plaintiff has failed to take all
reasonable steps to mitigate
his or her loss lies upon the defendant:

applicant is not required to do something he cannot afford, however he may be
required to incur expense to mitigate his
applicant advised in his Victim Impact Statement he did not mitigate his loss as
he could not afford to do so:
On 1 September 2019, I ceased working at Crown Valley. At the time, my employer
owed me $35,000.00 in wages. I was getting increasingly
frustrated due to not
being paid for the work I did at Crown Valley, and I was not getting any other
work opportunities. I had no
source of income. I was running out of funds and
felt compelled to use the funds from the payout to pay for my debts and living
expenses. I attempted to save the bulk of the funds from the payout for my
dental expenses. Me options were very limited at the
time. By late March 2020,
the fund from the payout were used up.
On 20 March 2020, I obtained my first payment from Crown Valley. By that time,
the funds I received from the payout were exhausted.
applicant stated due to financial hardship from not being paid by Crown Valley,
in early August 2019 he entered into negotiations
with QBE Insurance and
received a payment on 13 August 2019. The records of QBE Insurance
indicate the applicant commenced negotiations
for a lump sum payment on 15 May
2019 and signed the settlement agreement on 19 July 2019. On about 31 July 2019
the applicant received
a lump sum payment from QBE Insurance in the amount of
$28,000. The variation in dates is relevant only as to the applicant's
situation when he received the lump sum payment and his ability to use
a portion of that money towards dental treatment rather than
expenses. When the applicant received the lump sum settlement he was gainfully
employed and had recently received a redundancy
Dr Abbondanza
suggested treatment options of dentures at a cost of $3,500 or of periodontal
treatment and a partial denture at a
cost of $6,000, both of which would have
corrected the applicant's appearance. Given Dr Abbondanza noted treatment
which involved
saving the applicant's teeth and implants was more likely to
fail, these options which had a relatively modest financial outlay could
been undertaken by the applicant from 31 July 2019.
note the applicant was without his upper teeth from 2015 to 2018. He did not
have treatment for the three missing lower teeth
between the offence and
negotiating settlement of his claim, despite QBE Insurance having accepted
liability to pay the medical
expenses on 29 October 2018, from which date
onwards the applicant could have had the dental repairs had he wished to do so.
applicant attended Dr Zaninovich on 4 October 2018 to have a
"tryin" appointment for the prosthetic teeth. The applicant was due
to attend a
subsequent appointment to have the teeth inserted but did not attend. Consistent
with his prior history of not having
dental treatment,
I find the applicant chose not to
have the dental treatment when he could afford to do so.
applicant's solicitors advised the applicant was employed by Crown Valley from
May/June 2019 until September 2019, receiving
a back payment of his
wages from Crown Valley in March 2020. It is unclear when the applicant
obtained employment after leaving
Crown Valley. I accept from about
September 2019, when he ceased employment at Crown Valley and when he
secured employment as a
forklift operator the applicant experienced difficulty
in paying for the treatment required.
have considered whether the applicant failed to mitigate his loss by not
undertaking the recommended dental treatment between 11
September 2018 and
applicant's inability to obtain employment
was due to his poor dentition,
whether or not the applicant failed to mitigate his loss by not having dental
treatment is irrelevant.
the evidence provided I do not accept the applicant's injury caused the
applicant to sustain any economic loss.
Future Treatment
applicant is entitled to compensation for expenses that are likely to be
reasonably incurred for any treatment the applicant
is likely to need as a
direct consequence of the injury suffered by the
two issues to be considered: what treatment the applicant requires, and whether
that treatment is required as a direct
consequence of the injury.
applicant "should be awarded such a sum of money as will, as nearly as possible,
put him in the same position as if he had not
sustained the
the incident the applicant had poor dentition and would have shortly required
replacement of his lower teeth. Almost any
treatment option is likely to
improve the applicant's teeth from what they were when the offence occurred.
Dr Zaninovich noted in
his report dated 5 November 2021 the
consequence of the offence was to improve the applicant's oral health in that it
active infections from his lower jaw and the loss of the infected
teeth subsequently allowed the bone and tissues to heal more favourably.
applicant has submitted a quote for future treatment of teeth 32, 41 and 42 in
the amount of $19,071. The quote allows for implants
and crown to those three
have set out at [16], above, the four treatment options recommended by
Dr Abbondanza. I note his concerns any treatment focused
on implants or
the saving of the applicant's teeth will "most likely lead to early failure of
treatment" and lead to the applicant
wearing dentures in any event. This is
consistent with the applicant having had seven implants placed in his upper jaw
in 2015, and
there only being four implants remaining as at 2018. I accept
Dr Abbondanza's opinion and find it is not reasonable for the applicant
have treatment requiring implants as it is unlikely to be successful.
Dr Abbondanza recommended two treatment options with either
a complete or
partial denture, I accept this treatment to be reasonable and would allow up to
$6,000 (being the higher of the two
estimated treatment costs) for such
applicant had extremely poor dentition prior to the offence. Both
Dr Zaninovich and Dr Abbondanza were of the opinion the applicant's
teeth would have been lost in the short term and the incident simply hastened
the need for the treatment. The dental experts commented
irrespective of the
offence, the applicant would have required the same treatment. In his report
dated 1 October 2018 Dr Michael
The injury at work has accelerated the need for treatment, although the teeth
inevitably would be scheduled for extraction and replacement
due to their
advanced state of disease.
If the work place incident did not occur, the damaged teeth would still have
required treatment. The treatment of choice would have
been extraction.
Dr Daniel Abbondanza, dentist, stated:
Without the reported incident the teeth would ultimately suffer the same fate.
The reported trauma would merely have hastened the
In essence, the fact remains that his lower teeth are in a poor state, the
incident has hastened the need for treatment but not changed
15 April 2021 I raised a concern with the applicant's solicitors given the
extent of the applicant's pre-existing damage to his
teeth the dental treatment
was not required as a result of the offence. In response the applicant's
solicitors drew my attention
In the matter of
Hansen v Bolton
, the relevant factors to
determining whether compensation should be awarded in respect of a pre-existing
condition was discussed
by Herron DCJ as follows:
Compensation
would not be awarded if the injury or loss would have occurred in any event due
to a pre-existing condition ... Where
it is not possible to disentangle the
consequences of a pre-existing condition and the consequence of the events, the
claimant is
entitled to compensation for the full injury and loss if the
claimant can establish that the compensable offence did contribute materially
the claimant's injury or loss.
Whilst we appreciate that our client had pre-existing damage to his teeth, the
accused materially contributed to our client’s
loss of three bottom teeth
by repeatedly punching our client in the face on the Date of
above quoted paragraph is selective and incomplete. At [85] Heron DCJ in fact
adopted the reasoning of Sleight DCJ regarding
the relevant principles where an
applicant has a pre-existing condition in
a complainant has a pre-existing condition a number of principles must be taken
into account:
(a) The onus is on the claimant to prove
that the compensable offence did contribute materially to the claimant's injury
However the offence need not be the sole cause of the injury or loss:
Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw
[1956] UKHL 1
[1956] AC 613
; Fagan v Crimes Compensation
[1982] HCA 49
(1982) 150 CLR 666.
(b) Compensation will not be awarded if the injury and loss would have
occurred in any event due to a pre-existing condition: Smith
v Leech Brain &
[1962] 2 QB 405.
Where it cannot be positively stated that the event (the
injury or loss) would have occurred in any event but it remained a probability
then the award of compensation must be reduced to take into account that
probability.
If it can be proved that the offence
has made a pre-existing
condition worse by aggravation, or
brings on a condition earlier, the
assessment of compensation is made on the basis of the worsening or acceleration
or both as the
case may be
: Zumeris v Testa
[1972] VicRp 97
[1972] VR 839.
(d) Where it is not possible to disentangle the consequences of a
pre-existing condition and the consequences of the offence, the
claimant is
entitled to compensation for the full injury and loss if the claimant has
establish that the compensable offence did
contribute materially to the
claimants injury or loss: Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw; Purkess v
[1965] HCA 34
(1965) 114 CLR 164
; MJN v MAJS
(2003) 35 SR (WA) 219
227 (Martino J).
(e) In respect of events which have already occurred the court decides on the
balance of probabilities whether a specific event has
occurred or not and
damages are assessed on an all or nothing approach. However, where it is
necessary to assess a hypothetical situation
such as whether a claimant's
pre-existing condition would in any event have prevented the claimant from
working in the future, the
court must perform an estimate of the likelihood that
the hypothetical situation may occur. If there is a fair chance that the
hypothetical
situation may occur, the court must evaluate that chance and
discount the compensation by the percentage that represents that chance:
NSW Insurance Ministerial Corporation
[1995] HCA 53
(1995) 184 CLR 485
– 500. These adjustments for probabilities is relevant to general damages
and past and future loss: Wilson v Peisley
(1975) 50 ALJR 207
, 212 (Stephen J);
[2010] WADC 86.
(Emphasis added)
the extent of the applicant's pre-existing dentition I find the applicant would
have required replacement of his teeth within
a short time frame of the offence
in any event. The offence has brought forward the need for the applicant to
undergo treatment
and accordingly the assessment of compensation is based on the
acceleration only. I have no evidence the applicant has incurred
or will incur
any additional costs as a result of the treatment being required earlier.
establish the treatment is required as a direct consequence of the injury the
applicant must establish the injury was the substantive
(or dominant) cause, as
opposed to a material
offence brought forward the applicant's need for treatment and did not change
the treatment he required. But for the injury,
the applicant still would have
required extraction and replacement of his teeth. (The injury meant the
applicant no longer required
the extraction of his teeth but still required
their replacement). The injury was not the substantive or dominant cause of the
required because such treatment would still have been required if the
injury had not occurred. I find the proposed future dental
treatment is not
required as a direct consequence of the injury.
Report fees
applicant is entitled to compensation for expenses that arise in obtaining any
report from a health professional or counsellor
in relation to the injury
suffered by the
applicant did not provide any invoice with respect to the report he provided
from Dr Zaninovich dated 5 November 2021 so I cannot
make an allowance
for this potential expense.
reports obtained by QBE Insurance are from a health professional and are in
relation to the injury suffered by the victim and
therefore comprise losses
pursuant to
section 6(2)(a)(ii)
I allow $975
for report expenses.
Summary of the assessment
have assessed the applicant's claim
$ 15,000.00
Loss of earning capacity
Future treatment expenses
Report expenses
$ 15,975.00
Deductions of amounts required under
Section 42(3)
provides as follows:
An assessor must deduct from a compensation award in relation to any injury or
loss suffered by a victim, or a close relative of
a deceased victim, any amount
that the victim or close relative has received whether under a contract of
insurance or otherwise,
for the injury or loss.
56 This means any amount the applicant has received for the injury or loss
whether under a contract of insurance or otherwise must
be deducted from the
compensation
applicant received payments of $28,975 in settlement of his workers compensation
claim. If the amount he received in settlement
of his claim is deducted from
the amount of my assessment, an outcome of $NIL arises. I raised my concerns
with respect to this with
the applicant's solicitors on 17 May 2021
advising I was required to deduct the amount of $29,875 from any award pursuant
of the Act and unless I assessed the claim at an amount
greater than $28,975 I would be unable to make an award in his favour.
response the applicant's solicitors
(e) In the matter of
Baker v His Honour Judge Stone
,1 the court
found that the purpose of the Act is to ensure that victims who will not
otherwise be compensated for their injury or
loss are compensated under the

of using the funds towards his dental

a copy of a letter from QBE Insurance to our client
regarding the Lump Sum payment for your consideration.
(i) In light of the above, we submit that QBE Insurance has failed to provide
adequate compensation to our client for:
i. past and
future loss of income;
ii. dental expenses in the amount of $19,071.00;
iii. loss of enjoyment of life/amenities; and
iv. pain, suffering, and mental harm arising out of the injury.
(j) We note that the above losses were reasonably incurred by our client as a
direct consequence of from the assault and as such
is entitled to compensation
under the Act.
2.2 "Double-Dipping"
Section 30(1)
of the Act provides that the statutory maximum for
compensation is in the amount of $75,000.
(b) In the matter of
Devos v James
,2 his Honour further found that
there is no provision in the Act that prevents “double-dipping”
where the previous compensation
awarded is less than the statutory maximum.
(c) As such, the Lump Sum payment awarded to our client does not prohibit our
client from seeking compensation in the full amount
for his injuries and losses
under the Act.
submission is correct in that the Act does not prevent "double-dipping" in
circumstances where compensation under the Act does
not exceed the difference
between the amount of $75,000 and the amount received from another
maximum the applicant could have received (if his claim had been assessed at
$75,000) was $46,025 after deducting the amount
of $28,975 pursuant to
of the Act. However, any compensation or damages of the type
for which compensation may be awarded for "injury or loss" as defined
must be deducted from an award
circumstances where the assessment is less than the amount already received by
the applicant, no additional payment can be
made to the applicant.
find the amount of $28,975 paid by QBE Insurance is a payment for 'injury' or
'loss' and must be deducted from the compensation
award. I assessed the
applicant's entitlement to compensation to be $15,975. From this I now deduct
the sum of $28,975, resulting
in a net amount to the applicant of $NIL.
Accordingly, I now refuse the application for compensation.
