INTRODUCTION:
February 2018, [Mr Golding] (
) and [Ms Golding] (
) have been engaged in almost constant litigation concerning their
son, [Child A], who is now 15 ½ years old. The parties agree
their parenting relationship is extremely toxic, and they are simply unable to
co-parent [Child A]. In September 2019, during
the first tranche of the
proceedings, the Single Expert Witness, [Dr D], predicted that the parties had
such fundamental differences
in their personalities, eventually the time would
come when it would be easier for [Child A] to choose to live with one parent and
have little or no contact with the other. Sadly, [Dr D's] prediction has come
to pass. In November 2023, [Child A] ran away from
his mother's home.
Since this time, [Child A] has lived with his father and refused to have
any contact with his mother.
mother sought orders in the terms of her Minute filed [in] November 2024.
In summary, she sought that: (1) [Child A] live with
her; (2) he spend time with
the father each alternate weekend from after school Friday to the commencement
of school on Monday, and
during the school holidays on a week about basis; (3)
[Child A] spend Mother's Day with the mother, and Father's Day with the father;
and (4) [Child A] be permitted to phone and video call the parent he is not
currently with, in accordance with his 'reasonable' wishes.
father sought orders in the terms set out in his Minute filed [in] November
2024. In summary, he sought orders that: (1) he
have sole parental
responsibility for [Child A]; (2) [Child A] live with him and spend time and
communicate with the mother according
to his wishes, and to be initiated by him;
(4) [Child A's] school be authorised to provide the mother with copies of
documents such
as [Child A's] school reports and awards; and (4) [Child A]
continue to attend [Supported Education High School].
Bannerman was appointed as the Independent Children's Lawyer (
represent [Child A's] interests. The ICL sought orders in the terms of his
Minute filed [in] December 2024, which were similar
to the orders sought by the
father. In summary, the ICL sought orders that: (1) [Child A] live with the
father and the father have
sole parental responsibility for him; (2) [Child A]
spend time with the mother in accordance with his wishes, and the father do all
things to encourage [Child A] to spend time with his mother; and (3) the
mother's consent to the issue of an Australian Passport
for [Child A] be
dispensed with and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade be authorised to
renew or issue a passport for the
child without the mother's consent.
the commencement of the trial, the father indicated that he consented to the
passport orders proposed by the ICL, as well as the
order that he encourage
[Child A] to spend time with his mother. At the conclusion of the trial,
the father and Ms Johnston, the
counsel for the
both agreed that there be some
additional orders made in the event that [Child A] continued to live with the
father, including in
relation to: (1) the provision of some medical information
concerning [Child A] to the mother; (2) the mother being permitted to
some communications with [Child A] (for example, by way of cards and small gifts
on some special occasion days); and (3)
orders to facilitate the father being
able to travel overseas with [Child A] for holidays.
the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that final orders should be made,
largely in the terms sought by the ICL.
THE EVIDENCE:
Family Law Act 1975
) applied in
this matter. Both parties were represented by legal counsel at the trial.
the purposes of the trial, the father relied on his trial
and several updating
affidavits.
He also relied upon the
affidavit of his partner, [Ms B], filed [in] July 2023. The mother relied on her
trial affidavit filed [in]
January 2024 together with the affidavit of her
friend, [Ms C], filed [in] November 2024. The ICL and both parties also relied,
a greater or lesser extent, on two reports by [Dr D], filed [in] September
2019 (in relation to the first tranche of the proceedings)
and [in] December
2023 (in relation to the current proceedings).
parties, [Ms B], and [Ms C] were cross-examined by opposing counsel and the ICL
(save and except for [Ms C], whom the ICL chose
not to cross-examine). I am
satisfied that the father and [Ms B] on the one hand, and the mother on the
other hand, were simply
unable to give their evidence in a balanced manner, due
to their incredibly negative and fixed views of each other. Sadly, even
formal environment of the courtroom, the hatred between the parents, and between
the mother and [Ms B], was palpable. I am
also satisfied that [Ms C] was also
largely unable to give her evidence in a balanced manner, due to her unwavering
(and entirely
blinkered) support of the mother. In particular, it was
clear from her cross‑examination that [Ms C] blindly accepted the
narrative about matters, and she was either entirely unaware of, or chose not to
reveal, the ongoing conflict between the
mother and [Child A] (particularly in
2022 and 2023).
contrast, I considered that [Dr D] was very helpful, professional, and balanced
in giving their evidence; and I had no hesitation
in accepting their evidence.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND:
Basic background facts
father was born in June 1975 and is now 49 years old. He is a [Public Servant].
The mother was born in May 1976 and is now 48
years old. She works as a
[retail agency worker] on a commission basis.
parties commenced cohabitation in late 1999 and married [in] April
2005. At the time of their marriage, the father was 30 years
old, and the
mother was 29 years old.
A] was born in June 2009.
[Child A] has a mild intellectual disability
and in addition, was diagnosed as having autism in May 2019.
parties separated under the one roof in February 2017 and then physically
separated on a final basis in August 2017, when [Child
A] was eight years
old. After separation, [Child A] primarily lived with the mother.
am satisfied that after the parties' separation, their conflict rapidly
escalated. Each party made family violence and other allegations
other party, and both parties "weaponised" complaint and court processes,
including not only proceedings in this Court,
but also competing applications
for Violence Restraining Orders (
) in the Magistrates Court of
Western Australia, the mother making formal complaints to the father's employer
[Redacted] presumably
to have him criminally charged and/or sanctioned and/or
dismissed from his employment, and the father seeking to have the mother
criminally charged for various matters.
History of the proceedings and other relevant events
father commenced parenting proceedings in this Court in February 2018. The
mother filed responding documents in March 2018,
also raising financial
issues. Mr Bannerman was appointed as the ICL to represent [Child A's]
interests, and [Dr D] was appointed
as the Single Expert Witness. I do not
propose to set out a detailed history of the first tranche of the proceedings,
save to record
the parties were involved in numerous interim and contravention applications in
2018 and 2019.
[Dr D] provided [their] first report in September 2019 ([
Dr D's] first
). The salient parts of the report, which I accept, were as
a) [Dr D] opined that the mother presented with very strong, conflicted views.
She had a very strong hatred of the father but wanted
[Child A] to have a
father. She was not good at taking feedback. She tended not to see her part in
the conflictual dynamic between
her and the father and instead, blamed the
father. Whilst the father raised concerns that the mother was mentally
unstable, [Dr
D] opined that the larger part of the problem was the mother's
personality and hatred, rather than mental
instability.
b) [Dr D] opined that the father was friendly and somewhat talkative, presented
as quite organised and plausible in his explanation,
but was not overly
reflective and also struggled to take on
c) [Dr D] opined that "while both parents presented as quite high functioning,
there was a level of animosity, including violence
restraining orders (VROs) and
counter-VROs, allegations and counter allegations, which in a nutshell, could be
reduced down to [the
mother] seeing [the father] as controlling and
manipulative, and [the father] seeing [the mother] as controlling and
mentally unstable,
because of the way in which she deals with
They exhibited a high
degree of "nastiness" between each
d) At paragraphs 18 and 19, [Dr D] reported that:
happens, both parents are going to be involved in [Child A's] life. [Child A]
loves both parents and, although [Child A]
is very aware that his parents fight
and do not get on, he is able to transition between both parents. It will only
harm [Child
A] if the parents cannot sort things out. I note that through
various restraining orders, communications have largely shut down.
recommend the parties consider using email communication through the Our Family
Wizard app ... However, I do not see mediation
or family therapy likely to be
beneficial, because the underlying core problems stem back to personality
differences which have been
evident from the beginning of the relationship.
sad outcome is that where such fundamental differences in personalities are
evident, there will come a time when it becomes easier
for [Child A] to take a
side rather than transition between the two houses. With his intellectual
disability, that is likely to
be a little older than the normal 12 to 14 years
age range, but at some point, [Child A] will find it easier to stay with one
and not the other. While at this stage he is a little more aligned with
the mother, because of the nature of his personality and
the differing parent
arrangements, it could go in either direction, unless the parties can settle
down the conflict.
[in] October 2019 the Court made a number of orders, including final consent
parenting orders which provided,
, for the parties to have
equal shared parental responsibility for [Child A], and the child to live with
the father for five nights
each fortnight and otherwise with the mother.
late 2019, the parties' competing VRO applications were dealt with at a trial
before a Magistrate of the Magistrates Court of
Western Australia. The
father's application for a final VRO was granted; the mother's application for a
final VRO was dismissed.
In summary, in his Honour's reasons for
the presiding Magistrate
, that the mother: (1) had made strategic, baseless
complaints to get the father into trouble; (2) the mother had acted maliciously
in sending a photograph of [Child A's] anus/genital area and financial documents
to a paternal family member; (3) the mother was
unhappy with the parenting
orders made by this Court and she took steps to try to deny the father access to
[Child A], including
by surveilling the father; and (4) the mother had breached
the interim VRO protecting the father by sending him a "manipulative and
self-serving" email, which "was an attempt forcefully by [the mother] to impose
a detriment on someone other than her and it did
not mark her as a person who
was either easily pushed around or influenced but rather marked her as a pusher
and influencer and a
manipulative
late 2019 and 2020, the parties continued to engage in litigation in this Court,
including the father filing a further contravention
application and the parties
filing interim applications regarding various issues. The father then
commenced the current proceedings
[in] November 2020 and the mother
filed her responding documents [in] December 2020. At the time, the key issue
in dispute related
to where [Child A] would attend high school. [In] December
2020, the Court made orders (as sought by the father) for [Child A]
enrolled at a [Supported Education High School] to commence in Term 1, 2021.
However, subsequently, both parties made further
allegations and
counter-allegations against each other, bringing the existing live with
arrangements into contention, and they filed
multiple interim and/or
contravention applications. [In] January 2023, following a defended
trial, the mother was found to have
contravened various parenting orders without
reasonable excuse, and was required to enter a bond. Orders were also made
father to have make-up time with [Child A].
was common ground that [Child A] was exposed to the parties' ongoing conflict
and had some awareness of the ongoing court proceedings.
satisfied that he was harmed by the ongoing conflict. For example, I
am satisfied that in mid-2022 the mother took [Child
A] to the airport for
handover (contrary to the existing orders and specifically against the father's
wishes). An incident then
occurred between the mother and [Ms B],
during which the mother physically manhandled [Child A] to prevent him
getting out of her
car. The mother conceded under cross‑examination that
the incident was unjustifiable and appalling. As a further example,
the mother also conceded that her actions in making [Child A] bend over while
naked, taking a photograph of his anus/genital area
and electronically
distributing the photo to various people was retaliatory and inappropriate.
am satisfied that particularly in 2022 and 2023, [Child A] and the mother
experienced increased conflict with each other and that
at times, the mother
reacted angrily towards [Child A]. The subpoenaed notes from [Child A's]
NDIS therapist, [Mr E], recorded that
[in] June 2023 [Child A] said
that he was "
sick and tired of his mother being mean and rude to
[In] October 2023
[Child A] told another student at his school that his mother had been physically
hitting him. The student reported
[Child A's] disclosure to school staff, who
then made a notification to the Department of Communities. [In] October 2023, a
Assessment Interview was conducted with [Child A] at school, during which
he made disclosures about his mother and voiced his preference
to stay with the
The Department then
commenced some safety planning with the parents. However, in the meantime
[in] November 2023, [Child A] left
the mother's care and moved to live with
the father.
am satisfied that [Child A] acted himself to leave the mother's care but sought
his father's assistance (over the telephone), including
to navigate the public
transport system to get to his father's house. The following day, the
mother waited for [Child A] after school
and then followed him onto public
transport, ignoring [Child A's] shouted requests that she leave him alone.
[Child A] again contacted
his father by phone for assistance and eventually the
mother stopped following [Child A]. The mother subsequently contacted the
police, requesting a welfare check of [Child A] at the father's home.
I accept the father's evidence that the attending police officers

his wellbeing. [Child A] again made a number of disclosures to the
officers about his mother.
Department concluded that [Child A] had "self-selected" to live with his father
and it had no concerns for [Child A] in his
[In] or about November 2023, the father applied for, and obtained, a VRO
protecting [Child A] from his mother. The father also
facilitated [Child A] to
make a criminal complaint regarding his disclosures to the police during the
welfare check [in] November
December 2023, [Dr D] provided [their] second
The salient parts
of the report, which I also accept, were as follows:
a) After providing [their] first report, [Dr D] had no contact with the family
until October 2023, when court orders were made for
[them] to do an updated
b) Aside from meeting with the parties for the purposes of [their] second
report, [Dr D] met with [Child A] on three occasions:
[in] October 2023 (when he
was brought to interview by his mother), [in] November 2023 (when he was brought
to interview by his father),
and again [in] December 2023, after [Child A] had
run away from his mother's home and was living with his father. [Dr D] also
with [Child A's] therapist through the NDIS, [Mr E], who (at the
time) had seen [Child A] for 59 sessions over the previous 2½
c) [Mr E] reported that [Child A] has had issues for a long time with his
mother. [Child A] loves his mother, but over a long period
of time, expressed
that his mother is mean and rude to him. At the time of preparing the
second report, the mother had ceased [Child
A's] therapy with [Mr E].
[Mr E] considered that the therapy should continue; and [Dr D]
opined that the therapy should be court
ordered and both parties restrained from
any involvement unless requested.
d) [Dr D] opined that a perusal of the court documents over the past four years
since [their] first report revealed that the parties
had engaged in significant
conflict, with no sign of any resolution; and that "(T)here was not a shred of
evidence that the parties
are co-parenting on the same page."
e) At paragraphs 16 to 19 of [their] updated report, [Dr D] summarised the
ongoing disputes between the parties as follows:
dynamics have been extremely difficult. For example, the mother moving further
away, making shared-care not overly viable and
in the process she has wanted to
move [Child A's] school, the parties disagreeing on the nature of the schooling,
the father describing
the current school as providing a good level of support
for [Child A], [Child A] liking it and thriving in the environment, the mother
arguing that [Child A] should be in a more mainstream programme because, while
he has a disability, he is being held back in the
current forum and would learn
a greater level of independence and skill in the school she is proposing.
I note that [Mr E] is of
the opinion that the current school is meeting
[Child A's] friendship needs and he would be devastated if he had to
change schools.
parties have had reoccurring issues around the father's time with [Child A]. In
particular, in the first week of each term the
parties have a fundamental
disagreement as to whether or not the father should have his overnight visit,
the parties disagreeing
around interpretation and the situation resulting in the
disagreement overflowing to the school. This argument wastes a lot of Court
time and is a source of significant conflict. When I have read the previous
Court appearance, the mother was clearly told what the
interpretation was, but
then it occurred again at the start of 4
term. When I asked the
mother about it, she believes that Magistrate [Redacted] interpreted the Order
wrongly. It is clear that
this has to be defined.
talking to the mother, she makes it abundantly clear that she believes the
father and his partner [Ms B] are adversarial, oppositional,
supportive. When speaking to the father, he paints a picture of
[Child A] not wanting to be with the mother, that he is not
happy and that
the mother mistreats [Child A], particularly due to her dislike of the father
and [Ms B].
one of the few areas where the parties agree is that the arrangements are not
working for [Child A], that ultimately the mother
wants [Child A] in the school
near her, essentially wants parental authority and the father to have holiday
time which does not interfere
with school. The father believes that [Child A]
is at risk, that he and [Ms B] should have full care of [Child A], and that
mother's time should be limited, and that he and [Ms B] should have parental
responsibility. The mother described wanting full care
over [Child A's]
education and ideally [the father] having more time in the holidays. I
could not determine if she thought he should
have any time during the school
f) [Dr D] opined that the mother came across as quite bitter. She was of the
opinion that [Child A] did not like to go to his father
because they argue so
much and that he is "forced to go". (I observe that the mother
maintained her belief under cross-examination.
However, I am satisfied that
there was simply no cogent evidence that [Child A] disliked going to his
father's home because the
father and [Ms B] argued so much; and that rather,
[Child A] enjoyed going to his father's home). The mother also complained that
[Child A] had been physically violent to her, and she believed that the
father had "trained" [Child A] in this regard. (I observe
that the mother
also maintained her belief in this regard under cross-examination). However, I
am again satisfied that there was
simply no cogent evidence that the father
had trained [Child A] in this regard, as alleged by the mother.
g) [Dr D] opined that the father presented as concerned about [Child A],
particularly in regard to [Child A's] wishes and [Child
A's] view that his
mother was difficult to live with and had been abusive to [Child A]. The father
detailed a number of incidents
which had occurred over the previous year,
including: (1) the mother insisting on one holiday handover occurring at the
and then physically restraining [Child A] from getting out of the
car; and (2) the mother locking [Child A] out of her house, him
distressed and knocking on the door so heavily that he cracked the glass and cut
h) At paragraphs 46 and 47 of [their] updated report, [Dr D] then summarised the
developments that led to [Child A] changing residence,
as follows:
conducting this assessment there has been another incident of maltreatment
allegations. This has been documented, reported
to CPFS and Police. Over the
space of several days, [Child A] had been fighting with his mother, he then ran
away. This resulted
in mother and [Child A] fighting over a phone in at the
station and [Child A] got very minor scratches. [Child A] was unhappy
had gone to his father's house. On the recording [sic] the mother was
following him and the father, and [Ms B] were coaching him
to get on the bus and
then train and not go to the mother.
situation is problematic in so many ways. It is clear that there is a conflict
with the mother and [Child A] at times. The
mother seems to be
unreasonable and reactive at times. It is evident that [Child A] is on the
receiving end of actions by the mother.
The father is classing it as abuse and
while it may meet the definitions it is turning parent‑child conflict into
[sic] criminal
actions and weaponizing the situation. The way in which the
Father and [Ms B] deal with things is also undermining the
position. [Child A] is a special needs child caught in the middle
of this. He clearly for a long time favours the father. However,
this ongoing situation must be incredibly taxing on him.
D] described [Child A] as a big boy (I observe that the father put his weight at
around 100 kilograms). However, his personality,
because of his disabilities,
means that he is a sweet and loving boy with a sensitive nature, tends to be
quite literal (not inclined
to lie), is fairly "simple" and is mentally more
like a 10-year-old. [Dr D] opined that there is no question [Child A] has an
intellectual
disability, is a vulnerable young person and his emotional
development is significantly younger than his chronological age. He was
aware of his parents' relationship difficulties.
j) [Child A] was consistent in his views across his interviews. He told
[Dr D] that he liked to go to his father's house and had
a good time. He did
not identify any particular problems when at his father's house. On the other
hand, with his mother, [Child
I don't like the yelling and
swearing. There's normally lots of it by mum. She gets mad about something,
sometimes I don't even
know why she's mad.
" When [Dr D] asked [Child A]
what might make it work better at each of his parents' homes, he said that:
With dad, everything's fine. With mum, no swearing, no punching, her to
tell me what I did wrong so I can learn from it
." [Child A] also
told [Dr D] that he did not fight with his father but sometimes he did with his
mother. [Child A] also described
having a good relationship with the father's
partner [Ms B]. He also spoke positively about his current school,
including his friends,
and that he liked the teachers and his Education
k) At the second interview (prior to [Child A] running away), [Child A] told [Dr
D] that his preferred living arrangement was: "
I would want to live with
dad and my step mum, I'd stay at dad's every school day
." He also said that
he was really frightened about telling this to [Dr D], because he thought that
M)um will get angry and shout
" at him. [Child A] also told [Dr D] that
he wanted "
mum to be happy at whose house I live at and to not argue. I've
been asking for this for a while. I don't like upsetting mum
[Child A's] third interview (after [Child A] had run away), [Child A] told [Dr
D] about what had happened. [Dr D] opined that
it was clear that it was [Child
A's] decision to run away and was unaided (albeit his actions were not
discouraged by the father
and [Ms B]). [Child A] told [Dr D] that he was happy
at his father's place and was adamant that he did not want to see his mother
talk to her and was sick of arguments and (her) mistreatment.
m) At paragraphs 62 to 67 of [their] report, [Dr D] concluded that:
was evident in this re-assessment, is that there is a toxic, conflictual dynamic
which has continued between these parties, and
has not remitted. Each sees the
other as the perpetrator of the problem. I note that the Court needs to be able
to test the evidence
and make some findings, but I can say from what I have
assessed, that the mother tends to have quite rigid and fixed views, and appears
to interpret things based on her framework rather than a balanced point of view.
The father's arguments seem more plausible, but
there are elements which suggest
the child has been influenced in the process, especially the comments around the
way in which [Ms
B] discusses issues with [Child A]. Their position is of
loving concern but does have implications for [Child A].
seems to be a point of agreement that the mother has a greater level of conflict
with [Child A] than [sic] the father does, and
[Child A] has clearly been
voicing a view of wanting more time with the father and [Ms B] for a
long time. Since running away from
his mother's home he wants nothing
to do with his mother. I suspect that will wane in the coming months as under
it all, he does
love his mother.
is evident that co-parenting is not viable. Both parents appear to agree with
this. Ultimately, I see there needs to be a prime
residence and, with the
distance created when the mother moved, the child needs to go to school near
whichever parent has prime care.
My recommendations in a perfect world would be
every second weekend, with a pick‑up and drop-off from school. The timing
of arrangements should be very clearly specified, e.g. which parent has the
first week of each of the short holidays, and that the
parent who has the first
week becomes the trigger point for where the weekend comes, e.g. the Court keeps
the child with the mother.
If the mother has the second week, the father would
have the child the first week of the school holidays and the first weekend of
term. While processes such as alternating who has the first week, e.g. even and
odd number years, alternating between holidays etc,
has merit in some cases. In
this case I believe it should be fixed to be the same pattern every term.
However, [Child A] has voted
with his feet and this will not be possible until
there has been some repair with his mother.
issue of level of harm needs to be determined. I understand there are
current police and CPFS investigations and their findings
will be helpful in
determining whether [Child A] should be seen as being at unacceptable risk.
However, I see it more as parent-child
conflict rather than illegal acts of
malicious harm.
my opinion, [Child A] is happier with his father and [Ms B] and given his
age and proximity to the school, they should have majority
care. He has voted
with his feet and at his size and stage [sic] of development any other option
will be hard to implement.
think [Child A] needs at least three months to calm down before any attempt at
forcing contact with [Child A] and his mother takes
place. If [Child A] wants
to call or spend time with his mother it should be encouraged and the Orders
allow for it to be facilitated.
the father understood from the investigating officer that the mother was
arrested and charged with aggravated common assault
of [Child A] in or about
January 2024, he conceded that the mother was not, in fact charged. However,
during 2024 the father has
periodically chased up the investigating police
officer about the status of the criminal complaint.
moving to live with his father, [Child A] has refused to spend time with the
mother and has rebuffed her attempts to communicate
with him. Pursuant to the
terms of the final VRO made [in] April 2024 protecting [Child A] from his
mother, she is currently unable
to communicate with [Child A] by any means,
unless initiated or invited by [Child A].
March 2024, the Court made interim orders (by consent as between the father and
the ICL; and not opposed by the mother) that:
(1) [Child A] live with the
father; (2) the father have sole parental responsibility for the purposes of
decision-making regarding
any therapies and NDIS information for [Child A]; and
(3) [Child A] communicate with and spend time with the mother in accordance
his wishes and the father do encourage and facilitate such wishes. [Child
A] recommenced his NDIS therapy with his new therapist
in or about May
June 2024, Mr Bannerman met with [Child A] and then reported,
, that: (1) [Child A] was positive about most things in
his life and the only thing he wanted to be critical of was his mother; (2)
[Child A] had a firmly held view that his mother had involved him in the
court‑based disagreement with his father and [Ms B]
and he sees things in
a fairly black and white fashion; (3) although Mr Bannerman made a number
of suggestions to [Child A] about
reconnecting with his mother, [Child A]
was not agreeable; and (4) trying to force [Child A] against his wishes was
going to be difficult
likely counterproductive.
August 2024, the Court made interim orders suspending the interim spend time
with order made [in] March 2024 and in lieu thereof,
making orders for the
mother to spend time with [Child A], supervised by [The Supervision Agency]. At
the end of the day, the supervised
time did not proceed, as [Child A] simply
refused to attend.
cross-examination, and after having the opportunity to review further relevant
documents, [Dr D] expanded on [their] first
and second reports. In particular,
I accept [their] evidence that:
a) [Child A] should continue to live with the father. As [Dr D] predicted in
[their] first report, [Child A] reached the point where
he voted with his feet
to minimise the harmful impacts to himself of the ongoing warfare between his
parents. [Child A] cannot have
both of his parents in the
"same psychological space" and to now do so (for example: by resuming some
sort of shared care arrangement
or permitting his mother to attend school events
or sports activities) will significantly increase his anxiety / emotional
b) Although [they were] critical in [their] second report of the father for
"weaponizing" complaint processes and court proceedings,
[Dr D] confirmed that
the reality is that both parties engage in this type of conduct.
c) Each party continues to wholly blame the other for the current circumstances
and they have no insight into their own inappropriate
behaviours. [Dr D]
considered that each of the parties bears a significant proportion of the blame,
albeit the mother has "the larger
share". In particular, [Dr D] opined that:
, although the mother fundamentally believes that the father has
orchestrated the current situation, her own behaviour has significantly
contributed to [Child A] now living with his father and refusing to have any
conflict in
their relationship over a long period of time, and [Dr D] simply could not get
[their] "head around" some of the things
the mother has done in the past to
escalate things for [Child A].
, while there was some
justification for the father's concerns about [Child A] when in his
mother's care, the father's views were
"extreme". The father (and
[Ms B]) held fixed beliefs that the conflict between the mother and [Child
A] amounted to "abuse". They
are unwilling to support [Child A] having a
relationship with "an abusive parent" and through their conversations with
are likely to be reinforcing to the child that the mother's behaviour
is "abusive".
d) Given their fundamental personalities, family therapy will not assist the
parties at all to develop some insight to help them
overcome their entrenched
conflict and fixed views about the other being harmful to [Child A]. Given his
intellectual disability,
family therapy will also not assist [Child A].
However, [Child A] should continue with his NDIS therapy, which is vital to
his emotional skills.
e) Any attempt by the Court at "social engineering" (for example, making
orders that require [Child A] to spend time with or communicate
mother), effectively to force [Child A] to have a relationship with his mother,
will not change anything and will not work
(unless actively supported by the
father – which is highly unlikely to happen, given his entrenched views
However, a "crack in the door" needs to be left open for
[Child A] to eventually repair the relationship with his mother.
unlikely to occur until [Child A] reaches adulthood, if at all, it
would be to his long-term benefit, both in terms of having relationships
both of his parents and because "avoidance and disrespect" are not good or
In this regard, [Dr D]
recommended that the mother be permitted to have some communications with [Child
A], so that he is aware
that she loves him and misses him.
f) [Child A] enjoys attending at the [Supported Education High School], the
school is supportive of him and his special needs, his
NDIS therapist reported
that [Child A] was happy at the school, and in [Dr D's] opinion, it made perfect
sense for him to stay at
that school (rather than move to [the Mainstream
Public High School] as the mother sought).

objects of that Part, which are set out in
They are to ensure that
the best interests of children are met, including by ensuring their safety, and
to give effect to the Convention
on the Rights of the Child to which Australia
is a signatory. In deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in
to a child, I must, pursuant to s 60CA, regard the best interests
of the child as the paramount consideration. In determining what
child's best interests, I must consider the matters set out in s 60CC(2) as
(a) what arrangements would promote the safety (including safety from being
subjected to, or exposed to, family violence, abuse,
neglect, or other harm) of:
(i) the child; and
(ii) each person who has care of the child (whether or not a person has
parental responsibility for the child);
(b) any views expressed by the child;
(c) the developmental, psychological, emotional and cultural needs of the
(d) the capacity of each person who has or is proposed to have parental
responsibility for the child to provide for the child's
developmental,
psychological, emotional and cultural needs;
(e) the benefit to the child of being able to have a relationship with the
child's parents, and other people who are significant
to the child, where it is
safe to do so;
(f) anything else that is relevant to the particular circumstances of the
35 Section 60CC(2A) provides that in considering the matters set out in
s 60CC(2)(a), I must include consideration of any history
violence, abuse or neglect involving the child or a person caring for them, and
any family violence order that applies

of their family.
issues that are joined between the parties will dictate which s 60CC
factors are relevant. The requirement to consider each
matter set out in
s 60CC does not mean that each factor must be expressly discussed in a
judgment, where the factor in question has
no sufficient relevance
to displace the determinative significance of factors
specifically discussed.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS:
What arrangements would promote
the safety of the child and each person who has care of the child (including
safety from being subjected
to, or exposed to, family violence, abuse, neglect,
or other harm).
am satisfied that the parties have an extremely toxic parenting relationship, to
which [Child A] has been exposed, and harmed,
over an extended period of time.
Both parties have sought VROs against each other (and [Ms B] also sought a
restraining order against
the mother protecting herself after the incident at
the airport in mid-2022). The mother's and [Ms B's] applications were
dismissed. The father was granted a final VRO against the
mother, which was subsequently extended. It has now lapsed. The mother
been convicted of one breach of the VRO protecting the father, relating to the
email she sent him in 2019.
am satisfied that in November 2023, [Child A] voted with his feet to minimise
the harmful impacts to himself of the ongoing warfare
between his parents.
[Child A] cannot have both of his parents in the "same psychological space" and
to now do so will significantly
increase his anxiety / emotional distress. The
father obtained an interim VRO protecting [Child A] from his mother in November
The interim VRO was made final in April 2024, for a period of two
years. The final VRO (subject to any orders of this Court) severely
the mother's ability to have any contact with [Child A].
the mother believes that [Child A] is at ongoing risk of harm in his father's
care, I am not persuaded that there was any
cogent evidence that this was the
case. I am satisfied that [Child A] is happy and safe in his father's
father believes that the mother has physically and emotionally abused [Child A]
and that she poses an ongoing risk of harm to
the child. Under
cross-examination, the mother eventually and grudgingly conceded that she and
[Child A] had experienced conflict
in their relationship. Although the
mother maintained that [Child A] was physically aggressive to her at times, she
denied often
being angry with [Child A] or using physical or other inappropriate
disciplinary measures with him. On the other hand, over an extended
time [Child A] has made reports of inappropriate behaviour by the mother,
including her being mean and rude to him, lots
of shouting and swearing at him,
throwing things at him, and hitting him. [Child A] has made such reports not
only to his father
and [Ms B], but also to [Mr E], a fellow student at his
school, Department of Communities worker(s) who attended at the school to
interview [Child A] in October 2023, police officers who attended to conduct the
welfare check on [Child A] at the father's home
[in] November 2023, and [Dr D].
cross-examination, the mother maintained her belief that the father engineered
or influenced [Child A] to make false reports
parties. She also gave the rather bizarre explanation that [Child A] made the
false reports about
her because he felt unsafe at his father's home and regarded
her as his safe parent. While I am not satisfied that the father encouraged
[Child A] to make false reports, I consider it very likely that he did encourage
[Child A] to make his concerns about his mother
known to third parties,
such as [Mr E]. On balance, I am satisfied that [Child A's] reports
to the father, [Ms B], and other independent
third parties concerning episodes
of conflict with his mother are likely to be generally truthful; and that [Child
A] was harmed
by the conflict with his mother, in the sense of being distressed
and confused by his mother's behaviour towards him. However, I
persuaded on the available evidence that the mother's behaviour was criminal, as
the father appeared to maintain.
my view, and notwithstanding some grudging concessions late in her
cross-examination, the mother did not demonstrate any real
insight into, or
willingness to accept responsibility for, her own inappropriate behaviours
towards [Child A] over an extended period
of time. In future, were
[Child A] to live with the mother or spend significant time in her care, I have
little confidence that
she will be able to appropriately manage her behaviour
during any further conflicts she may have with [Child A]; and that she is
to subject [Child A] to further inappropriate behaviour (such as shouting and
swearing at him) and cause him further distress
and confusion.
Any views expressed by the child.
am satisfied that over an extended period of time, [Child A] has consistently
told various people, including his father, [Ms B],
Department of Communities
worker(s), police officers, and [Dr D], that he wanted to live with his father.
However, having regard
to [Child A's] comments as recorded in [Dr D's]
second report, I am also satisfied that until late 2023, [Child A] was afraid to
tell his mother of his views, because he thought that she would get angry and
shout at him.
June 2024, during his meeting with Mr Bannerman, [Child A] was positive about
most things in his life but was very resistant to
having any future contact with
his mother. Since this time, [Child A] has also refused to spend supervised
time with his mother,
and expressed his view to the supervisor that he did not
want any contact with his mother.
cross-examination, the mother maintained her belief that [Child A's] views had
been "coerced" by his father and [Ms B]. I
am not persuaded this is the case,
and rather, I am satisfied that [Child A's] views have been shaped primarily by:
(1) him reaching
the point where he needed to vote with his feet to minimise the
harmful impacts to himself of the ongoing warfare between his parents;
his experiences in his parents' two households, including liking to go to his
father's house and having a good time, as compared
with the ongoing conflict
with his mother in her home, including his mother yelling and swearing at him.
However, I also accept
that [Child A] has been exposed to his father's and [Ms
B's] negative views and undermining comments about the mother, and this may
influenced his views to some degree.
[Child A] suffers from a mild intellectual disability and autism, neither the
parents nor [Dr D] maintained that these conditions
precluded the Court from
taking [Child A's] views into account or that the Court should give them little
or no weight. I am satisfied
that I should give significant weight to [Child
A's] views.
The developmental, psychological, emotional, and cultural needs
of the child.
I have earlier identified, [Child A] suffers from a mild intellectual disability
and autism.
the years, the parties have had innumerable disputes over [Child
A's] education, extra-curricular activities, and healthcare.
[In] December 2020, the Court made orders (as sought by the father) that
[Child A] be enrolled to attend high school at [Supported
Education High
School] from the commencement of Term 1, 2021. [Child A] will commence
Year 11 in 2025, which will include a vocational
component. I am satisfied that
[Child A] is well supported by the school, is happy at the school, is making
reasonable progress,
and would be very distressed if he were required to move to
a new school. [Child A] also continues to engage in various extracurricular
activities which he enjoys, including basketball and netball.
late 2023, the mother withdrew her consent to [Mr E] continuing to provide NDIS
therapy to [Child A]. In my view, the mother's
decision in this regard was not
child focussed, and instead was a reaction to her dissatisfaction with [Mr E's]
recording of [Child
A's] concerns about her being mean and rude. [In] March
2024, the Court made orders,
, for the father to have sole
parental responsibility for the purposes of decisions regarding any therapies
and NDIS information for
[Child A]. In May 2024, [Child A] recommenced his NDIS
therapy with another therapist. I am satisfied that it is vital that
A] continues to engage with his NDIS-funded therapy and other supports
and that the father will take appropriate steps to ensure
that [Child A]
continues to receive them.
The capacity of each person who has or is proposed to have
parental responsibility for the child to provide for the child's developmental,
psychological, emotional, and cultural needs.
for the following matters, I am satisfied that each party individually has the
capacity to provide for [Child A's] needs:
, I am satisfied that
since their separation, the parties have amply demonstrated that they have no
capacity to co-operatively co‑parent
each party's ability to consistently meet all of [Child A's] needs has been
compromised, to a greater or lesser degree, by their
extremely toxic
relationship with each other and their fixed beliefs about each other.
, the mother did not demonstrate any real insight into, or
willingness to accept responsibility for, her own part in her conflicts
[Child A] prior to November 2023, including that her behaviour caused [Child A]
to be distressed and confused, and contributed
to his decision in November 2023
to live with his father.
The benefit to the child of being able to have a relationship
with the child's parents, and other people who are significant to the
where it is safe to do so.
am satisfied that "deep down", [Child A] dearly loves both his parents.
However, he reached the point in November 2023 where he
could no longer cope
with the ongoing warfare between his parents and opted to live with his father
and have no contact with his
mother. [Child A] cannot currently have both of
his parents in the "same psychological space". It is currently not
safe for [Child
A] to do so, as it will significantly increase his anxiety /
emotional distress. To that end, I am satisfied it would not be in
A's] best interests to make orders to enable the mother to attend at school
events and at [Child A's] extracurricular activities,
even subject to the
condition (as suggested by her counsel) that she not approach [Child
I have earlier found, I am satisfied that [Child A] is happy and safe in his
father's care. I am also satisfied that [Child A]
has a close and affectionate
relationship with [Ms B]. There is a real benefit to [Child A] in
continuing to have a relationship
with his father and stepmother.
A] currently has no relationship with his mother. Notwithstanding the potential
long-term detriments to [Child A] of not
repairing the relationship with his
mother (as identified by [Dr D]) I am satisfied that it would be emotionally
harmful to [Child
A] (and ultimately futile) to try to force him to repair
his relationship with his mother in the short to medium term, including
making orders for a change of residence (as sought by his mother) or for him to
be required to spend time with and communicate
with his mother. This is because
I am satisfied that:
a) [Child A] is adamantly opposed to having any contact with his mother and to
force him to do so will inevitably cause him to suffer
significant distress and
b) The father and [Ms B] hate the mother and hold fixed beliefs about her being
an abusive parent. As such, they are highly unlikely
to genuinely support and
encourage [Child A] to repair the relationship.
c) The mother hates the father and [Ms B] and holds fixed beliefs about them,
including that they have "coerced" [Child A's] views
and encouraged [Child
A] to make false complaints about her. The mother also has little, if any,
insight into her own inappropriate
behaviours towards [Child A]. As such I
have little confidence that anything will change in the short to medium term,
should [Child
A] live with or spend time with his mother.
d) As Mr Bannerman told the parties in June 2024, trying to force [Child A]
against his wishes would be difficult and likely counterproductive.
particular, I am satisfied that: (1) the father is highly unlikely to
genuinely encourage [Child A] to have contact with the
mother, if so ordered;
and (2) the mother simply has no viable or realistic plan to make
am satisfied that, as recommended by [Dr D], a "crack in the door" needs to
be left open for [Child A] to eventually repair the
relationship with his
mother, even though it is unlikely to occur until [Child A] reaches adulthood,
if ever. To that end, I am
satisfied that the mother should be permitted to
send cards and/or small gifts to [Child A] each year on his birthday and at
and that the mother should be permitted to send [Child A] a text
message (including a photograph) on a semi-regular basis, so that
that she does love him and misses him.
Anything else that is relevant to the particular circumstances
of the child.
parties sought an order for sole parental responsibility. The mother
conceded under cross-examination that if [Child A] continued
to live with
the father, then the father should have sole parental responsibility.
are no other circumstances that I consider relevant in making the decision of
what is in [Child A's] best interests.
Conclusions.
regard to my findings at paragraphs 37 to 56 above, I am satisfied that it is in
[Child A's] best interests for final orders
to be made that: (1) [Child A] lives
with the father; (2) the father have sole parental responsibility for [Child A];
and (3) [Child
A] spends time with and communicates with his mother in
accordance with his wishes.
father's position at the commencement of the trial was that he would consent to
the order sought by the ICL that he do all such
things to encourage [Child A] to
have contact with the mother. Even though I have significant doubts about
the father's willingness
to genuinely encourage [Child A] to spend time with his
mother, I am satisfied that the order is appropriate and in [Child A's] best
interests – even if just as a subtle reminder to the father of the ongoing
and long-term harm that is caused to [Child A] by
the continuation of the
parties' extremely toxic parenting relationship.
the conclusion of the trial, the ICL and the father (but not the mother) also
agreed to orders being made: (1) requiring the father
to give the mother notice
of any significant medical issues or hospitalisations concerning [Child A]; (2)
permitting the mother to
text [Child A] and send him cards and small gifts on
special occasion days, (and on the basis that the father would facilitate
A] receiving any such gifts and communications); and (3) to facilitate
the father being able to take [Child A] overseas for holidays,
without the
necessity for the mother to give her consent to the travel (and thereby reduce
the likelihood of further conflict and
applications having to be made to the
court to permit the travel). I am satisfied that these orders are also
appropriate and in
[Child A's] best interests. In particular, as I have earlier
found, I was satisfied that the mother should be permitted to send
[Child A] a
text message (including a photograph) on a semi‑regular basis
(as well as cards and small gifts on special occasions)
and consider that
monthly text messages are appropriate.
ICL sought an additional order that the father be restrained by injunction from
allowing any cards or gifts sent by the mother
to [Child A] to be destroyed
or discarded (on the basis that even if [Child A] refused to accept them
when initially sent, he may
later have a change of heart). I am satisfied
that this order is also appropriate and in [Child A's] best interests.
father sought a specific order that [Child A] continue to attend at [Supported
Education High School]. Even though such an order
is arguably redundant,
given that the father will have sole parental responsibility, I am satisfied
that the order sought is appropriate
and in [Child A's] best interests,
particularly as it will clearly put an end to the ongoing disputes between the
parties about this
