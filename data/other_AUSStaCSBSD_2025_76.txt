Treasury Laws Amendment
(Payday Superannuation) Bill
The bill seeks to amend the
Superannuation Guarantee (Administration)
and other legislation to incentivise employers to make
superannuation contributions for their employees when they pay the
qualifying earnings rather than on a quarterly basis. The bill
does so by enabling employers to reduce their liability for superannuation
guarantee charge (including to nil) by making employee superannuation
contributions on qualifying earnings to their superannuation
fund in a timely

1.328 Item 61 of Schedule 1 seeks to repeal and replace existing section 69
Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992
(SGA Act) to
provide that, if the Commissioner of Taxation pays an amount exceeding that
which is properly payable under Part 8,
they may recover that excess payment,
wholly or in part, as a debt due to the Commonwealth by specified persons under
certain conditions.
1.329 These conditions are that before seeking to recover any overpaid
amount, the Commissioner must have given the relevant debtor
written notice of
the proposed recovery at least 28 days before the overpayment is
Further, the amount
recovered must be no greater than that stated in the
1.330 Overpayments contemplated by the provision may be recovered from the
person to whom the payment was made; the superannuation
provider of a
superannuation fund or Retirement Savings Account that currently holds the
payment and any of the amounts wholly or
partly attributable to the payment; and
the benefitting employee where they have received one or more benefits from a
fund or RSA
that are attributable to the
1.331 Item 188 of Schedule 1 to the bill provides that proposed section 69 of
the SGA Act applies in relation to a payment made by
the Commissioner before, on
or after 1 July 2026.
1.332 Generally, where proposed legislation will have a retrospective effect,
the committee expects that the explanatory materials
will set out the reasons
why retrospectivity is sought, whether any persons are likely to be adversely
affected and the extent to
which their interests are likely to be affected. If
an individual's interests will, or may, be affected by the retrospective
application
of a provision, the explanatory memorandum should set out the
exceptional circumstances that nevertheless justify the use of retrospectivity.
In this instance, the explanatory memorandum states that:
The amendments to section 69 in the new law will apply in relation to a
payment by the Commissioner before, on or after 1 July 2026.
Section 69 relates
to recovery of overpaid amounts distributed by the Commissioner for the benefit
of employees under Part 8 of the
SGA Act. These changes are intended to make the
recovery of overpayments provisions consistent with similar provisions in other
law, and ensure that amounts can be recovered where they have been
rolled-over to a new fund or paid out as benefits to the member,
such that it is
not possible for the Commissioner to recover the monies from the person it was
originally paid to. As this is a technical
amendment to address a gap in the
recovery provisions, retrospective operation is appropriate to allow recovery of
overpaid amounts.
Safeguards apply to this provision, including the requirement
to give the person notice in
1.333 The committee does not consider that the strictly limited information
provided in the explanatory memorandum sufficiently addresses
the exceptional
circumstances required to justify the retrospective application of these
amendments. In particular, the committee
notes that the explanatory memorandum
does not engage with whether the proposed recovery of historic overpayments is
likely to have
an adverse effect on particular individuals or classes of
individual.
1.334 The committee requests that an addendum to the explanatory
memorandum providing details as to:
why it is appropriate to retrospectively apply proposed section 69
Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1999
whether any persons are likely to be detrimentally affected by the
retrospective application of the proposed amendments and, if so,
to what extent
their interests are likely to be affected
be tabled in Parliament as soon as practicable, noting the importance of
these explanatory materials as a point of access to understanding
the law and,
if needed, as extrinsic material to assist with
interpretation.
1.335 The committee otherwise draws its scrutiny concerns to the attention
of senators and leaves to the Senate as a whole the appropriateness
retrospective application of the amendments allowing the Commissioner of
Taxation to recover overpayments.
