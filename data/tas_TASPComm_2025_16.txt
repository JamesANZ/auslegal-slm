REASONS FOR DECISION
draft amendment proposes to make some changes to the South Brighton Specific
Area Plan (SAP), which are detailed below:
amend Figure
BRI-S11.2 The South Brighton Specific Area Plan Development Framework, and
in provision
BRI-S11.8.2 P1.2, replace the words of ‘Council’s adopted Key
Infrastructure Investments and Defined Infrastructure
Charges policy that is
relevant to the land’ with ‘Council’s adopted Infrastructure
Contributions Policy that is
relevant to the land.’ to reflect Brighton
Council’s amended policy.
The Infrastructure Contributions
Policy replaces Council’s Key Infrastructure Investments and Charges
Policy. Copies of both
policies were provided by the planning authority along
with a table that described the differences between them. The table below
provided by the planning authority in the supporting report outlines the key
differences between the superseded policy and amended
Key Infrastructure Investments and Charges Policy (superseded
Infrastructure Contribution Policy (amended policy)
6.4 – The removal of the ability for TasWater to impose headworks
charges has resulted in situation where the outlay costs of
infrastructure has prohibited strategic development. Effectively TasWater has no
means to recoup its costs and its investment
in new capacity building
infrastructure has been limited.
6.5 – The result of this has meant that in the case of residential
rezonings and subdivisions, the first to develop must incur
major coasts that
then benefit all subsequent developers within that area.
6.6 – Council can fill this void by acting as an intermediary and
provide an investment in the upfront contribution to these
infrastructure
6.7 – There may be cases where strategic infrastructure other than
sewerage or water, such as roads, bridges, stormwater and
the like, may be
appropriate for such a strategic investment by Council
6.4 - The situation often arises where the first to undertake development
must incur major costs for critical infrastructure that
then benefit all
subsequent developers within that area. This is called the “first
mover” problem and it can be a significant
barrier to achieving strategic
development outcomes.
6.5 – The issue is more prevalent for infill development projects
where land has recently been “upzoned” and there
are multiple
property owners. This can also result in development occurring in an ad-hoc
manner that creates undesirable and inefficient
6.6 - Council can fill this void by acting as an intermediary and provide
an investment in the upfront contribution to these infrastructure
collect contributions to provide a coordinated approach to infrastructure
6.7 - This policy will generally be applied to infrastructure that is the
responsibility of Council, such as roads, bridges, stormwater,
open space and
the like. There may be occasions where Council act as an intermediary to
collect funds for other infrastructure authorities
such as TasWater,
TasNetworks, etc.
The updates to the background section in the amended policy provide
developers with a clearer understanding of its rationale.
The amended policy explicitly identifies infill development and fragmented
land ownership as key challenges, offering greater clarity
on the factors
affecting infrastructure provision.
Additionally, it clarifies Council’s role, emphasizing that its
primary responsibility is for Council-managed infrastructure.
However, in some
cases, Council may act on behalf of other infrastructure authorities, such as
TasWater and TasNetworks. This reference
does not impose new obligations but
simply clarifies that Council may serve as a collector of contributions for
these entities, rather
than directly funding their infrastructure.
The amended policy (6.4-6.5) does not introduce a new principle but rather
formally names the existing issue as the "first mover"
problem to enhance
understanding. This terminology provides a clearer and more structured
explanation without altering the original
It is important to note that the background section does not function as a
set of policy principles or provisions that Council officers
are responsible for
implementing.
On this basis, the changes to the background section are minor refinements
that do not expand the scope of the amended policy.
Application
infrastructure investments of Council may include but are not limited to the
following general areas:
(b) sewerage;
(c) roads and other transport;
(d) public open space infrastructure;
(e) stormwater drainage;
(f) carparking.
Application
infrastructure investments of Council may include but are not limited to the
following general areas:
(a) roads and other transport;
(b) public open space and recreation infrastructure;
(c) stormwater drainage;
(d) carparking; or
(e) social infrastructure (e.g. buildings for youth hubs, social services, etc.)
The removal of water and sewerage form the list indicates that Council does
not provide those services.
Addition of social infrastructure While this appears to be a new category,
it does not fundamentally change Council’s role.
Many councils already
invest in community infrastructure (e.g., community centres, public facilities).
The inclusion of social infrastructure
clarifies that Council may also support
community-based infrastructure when it aligns with strategic development
objectives. It does
not introduce new financial burdens but rather provides a
clearer scope for the types of infrastructure that align with Council’s
strategic priorities.
The mention of recreation infrastructure does not expand Council’s
role but rather clarifies what public open space investment
may include.
Given that section 6.19 states that infrastructure investments “may
include but are not limited to” the listed areas,
these changes are minor
refinements rather than an expansion of Council’s role and do not
introduce a broader scope to the
Roles & Responsibilities

Issues raised in representations
The draft amendment was referred to TasWater under
section 56S
Water and Sewerage Industry Act 2008
. In response
TasWater made a representation stating no objection to the draft amendment and
that it did not wish to attend any hearing.
Aboriginal Heritage Tasmania put in a representation to alert the planning
authority of requirement to make contact prior to any development
on the site as
the site contains several Aboriginal heritage sites and a previous Aboriginal
heritage assessment had been undertaken
on the site.
A representation from a planning consultant for a property owner within the
SAP area was received which raised the following issues:
the SAP and the
SAP figures contain fundamental flaws, as the draft amendment imposes a static
plan of subdivision, alters an already
approved plan, and introduces an
unenforceable development standard around infrastructure contributions
there is a lack
of supporting information on the rationale for the draft amendment.
Planning authority’s response to the
representations
The planning authority considered the representations
and recommended no modification to the draft amendment.

Specific Area Plan
intent of the South Brighton SAP is to provide for sufficient public
infrastructure, housing diversity, improved residential amenity,
pedestrian connectivity and public and private landscaping.
achieve this, the SAP incorporates precincts and associated definitions. The SAP
applies in substitution or addition to the underlying
zone and code provisions
and contains Development Standards relating to future urban development,
vehicular access, frontage infrastructure,
landscaping, public open space and
development and works in the proposed precincts and subdivision.
the 40K report the planning authority submitted that the LPS criteria, which
incorporates
section 32(4)
requirement for a specific area plan, had been
addressed when the South Brighton SAP was originally approved by the Commission
planning authority submitted that the changes proposed as part of this draft
amendment were to correct a previous inconsistency
with the South Brighton
Development Framework, a change of name to the contributions policy and minor
changes within the policy.
It stated ‘...the policy's core elements
including purpose, scope, objectives, and payment processes remain unchanged,
consistency in the Council’s infrastructure investment
the hearing, Mr Boardman for Ms Ramilya Khayrutdinova submitted that it was
unclear what the amendment was for and the way the
planning authority exhibited
the amendment did not encourage public involvement in the planning process.
the hearing, Mr Van for the planning authority submitted that the newspaper
advertisement provided information on how documentation
on the draft amendment
could be viewed, including links to Council’s website and information on
how the public could be involved
and access further information.
Boardman submitted that the inclusion of the Development Framework Plan in the
SAP would result in a situation where future planning
scheme amendments would be
inevitable as it would restrict development which was not strictly in accordance
with the plan. Mr Boardman
also stated that policy being referenced to in a
clause in the planning scheme was problematic and would cause future issues
it were included as an incorporated document.
the hearing, the planning authority confirmed the revised Development Framework
Plan figure in the SAP was submitted with the original
amendment’s RZ
2022-05 section 40K report (in 2024) as a revised version to reflect the
Council’s modifications in its
section 40K report. Mr Van stated this
revised version was unfortunately inadvertently not updated in the
Commission’s final
approval. Therefore, this draft amendment is simply to
correct an error where a previous version had not been updated.
response to Mr Boardman’s concerns about restrictions in development
because of the Framework, Ms Blackwell for the planning
authority submitted that
the Performance Criteria would allow for developments to be considered through a
discretionary pathway which
did not strictly meet the Development Framework
Commission consideration
draft amendment does not change the operation of the SAP as detailed above. It
reflects the renaming of the Council’s policy,
and minor changes within
the policy which do not alter the operation or policy intent of the SAP.
addition, the draft amendment replaces Figure BRI-S11.2 which the planning
authority advised was incorrect as it was not consistent
with the modified
figure by the planning authority in response to representations in the section
40K report for previous draft amendment
RZ 2022-05.
Commission accepts the modified figure BRI-S11.2, and understands this version
was omitted in error in the preceding draft amendment
Schedule 1 Objectives
planning authority in its supporting report dated 1 April 2025 submitted that
the draft amendment would further the Schedule 1
Objectives by providing for the
fair, orderly and sustainable development of the area, improve strategic
outcomes and facilitate
economic development.

that the purpose of the draft amendment is consistent
with fair, orderly and
sustainable use and development, and that it seeks to further the Schedule 1
Objectives of the Act.
State Policies

the supporting report dated 1 April 2025 the planning authority submitted that
the draft amendment would have no direct impact
on water quality and any impact
on water quality will be regulated through future development
applications.
National Environment Protection Measures
the supporting report dated 1 April 2025 the planning authority submitted the
