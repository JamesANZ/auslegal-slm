In 2009, Lindgren J in Re Mad Canoe Advertising Pty Ltd (in liq)
questioned whether a trustee who has been disqualified from holding
office can continue to validly act as a trustee. Since then,
a clear answer has
emerged: a trustee who is disqualified becomes a bare trustee under the common
law. In this position, a bare trustee
has duties to get in and protect the trust
property as well as vindicate the rights attached to it. A disqualified trustee
have the power to sell trust property or hold it against a new trustee.
These limited powers under the common law are necessary in
the context of
disqualification, however, they may, in practice, restrict the trustee from
appropriately dealing with the trust property.
This could be problematic where a
new trustee cannot be appointed, or in situations where a liquidator is winding
up the corporate
trustee. However, the common law is complemented by the
Corporations Act 2001
Trustees Act 1962
(WA). These statutes provide a
flexible statutory overlay allowing courts to grant any necessary orders to deal
with the trust property
and excuse the trustee from breaches of trust where they
have acted honestly and reasonably. This article will argue that the common
law’s focus on protecting the trust property, taken with the flexible
statutory overlay creates an adequate legal regime.
I INTRODUCTION
Since Lindgren J questioned the position of a disqualified trustee in
Mad Canoe Advertising Pty Ltd (in liq) (‘Re Mad
consensus appears to have emerged under the common law, establishing that a
trustee who is disqualified becomes a bare
A bare trustee is a
trustee with no interest in the trust assets other than that existing by reason
of the office of trustee and
the holding of legal
In this position, a bare
trustee has duties to get in and protect the trust property as well as
vindicating the rights attached to
There is some uncertainty about
the exact powers of a bare trustee,
however, it is clear that their powers are limited and do not include a power of
The law in this respect needs
to be clarified in order to provide certainty to bare trustees who are, in many
cases, liquidators.
Nevertheless, the limited powers and duties of a bare
trustee are appropriate in circumstances of disqualification. While the
limited ability to deal with the trust property may cause issues
in some circumstances, these difficulties are alleviated by the
complimentary
statutory framework which allows courts to grant any necessary orders and excuse
the bare trustee of any breaches.
II THE POSITION OF A DISQUALIFIED TRUSTEE
Re Mad Canoe,
Lindgren J first questioned whether a trustee who has
been disqualified from holding office can continue to validly act as a trustee.
After going into voluntary administration, the liquidators of Mad Canoe
Advertising made an application under
Corporations Act 2001
Corporations Act
) to terminate the winding up
In the course of this
application, the issue arose as to whether Mad Canoe Advertising, carrying on
its business exclusively as a
trustee of a unit trust, could validly continue to
act as a trustee after being disqualified under the unit trust
In obiter, Lindgren J noted the ‘correct analysis’ seemed to be
that, after disqualification, Mad Canoe Advertising would
cease to exercise its
powers and duties under the unit trust deed but would continue to hold the trust
property on constructive trust
by operation of general law
principles.
Lindgren J also
questioned what the terms of the constructive trust would be but was not called
upon to resolve these issues in considering
application.
As Principal
Registrar Melville later remarked, the High Court in
CGU Insurance Ltd v
One.Tel Ltd (in liq)
‘answered the unanswered questions posed by Lindgren J’ as to the
position of a disqualified

Instead, it remained
with the trustee and continued to be held on trust for the benefit of the
beneficiary.

approved the primary judge’s conclusion, that upon termination of the
trust deed the trustee became a bare

‘bare trust’ has been ‘plagued by terminological
indeterminacy’,

The approach by the High Court in
CGU v One.Tel
has since been applied
consistently, for the most part, confirming the analysis offered by Lindgren J
that upon disqualification
a trustee continues to hold the trust property on
constructive trust by operation of general law
principles.
The High Court also
elaborated on another important aspect of this constructive trust, namely the
duties and powers of the bare trustee,
directly answering the question posed by
Lindgren J.
III DUTIES AND POWERS OF A DISQUALIFIED TRUSTEE
In the administration of a trust, trustees have powers and duties. Duties are
acts which a trustee must do or refrain from doing,
whereas powers are acts
which the trustee may do if they see
The nature of a bare trust
is not prescribed by the settlor but is left to the construction of the
As such, upon
disqualification a trustee is disqualified from performing the duties and
exercising the powers prescribed under the
However, the trustee
continues to hold duties and power under the general law outside the
The absence of active duties is generally understood to be one of the key
criteria of a bare trust.
However, as Meagher JA pointed out, this cannot be interpreted too strictly as
there is almost no situation where the trustee would
not have at least some
active duties in certain
circumstances.
Gummow J found
that a bare trustee has no ‘duty or further duty to perform, except to
convey [the trust property] upon demand
to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or
as directed by them’.
such, a disqualified trustee that continues to hold trust property is under an
‘ongoing obligation to vest that property
in any new trustee appointed to
replace it’.
According to
Stone, Jacobson and Edmonds JJ in
Bruton Holdings Pty Ltd (in liq) v
Commissioner of Taxation
bare trustee must maintain and protect the trust property but cannot engage in
active management beyond those
Finally, in
the High Court elaborated that a bare trustee:

office of the trustee ... One obligation of a trustee
which exists by virtue of

IV COMPLIMENTARY STATUTORY FRAMEWORK
The law on disqualified trustees needs further clarification but is overall
appropriate. The disqualification of a trustee indicates

the trust deed. It is appropriate
in that situation that the powers and duties
of the trustee are limited to those that are of upmost importance, namely the

Although, as noted above,
the powers of a bare trustee under general law, apart from being

clarification is needed around the exact powers of a disqualified trustee.
Additionally, the limited powers of a disqualified trustee can create
difficulties where the appointor is unwilling or unable to appoint

cause issues where a liquidator, acting on behalf of a disqualified corporate
trustee, needs to deal with

confer the necessary powers upon the

allows the court
to relieve a trustee from personal liability for breach of trust where the
trustee acted honestly and reasonably
and ought fairly to be excused for the

Section 1318
Corporations Act
provides a similar provision for corporate trustees
and their liquidators. This legislative framework has been utilised in several

provides an avenue to deal with the trust property, thereby diminishing the
difficulties that may arise
as a result of the restrictions placed on
disqualified trustees.

, for example, the liquidator was excused for selling a
BMW motor vehicle outside of his powers as bare trustee. In that case, Gordon
was satisfied that the liquidator had acted reasonably and honestly as they sold
the BMW for a reasonable price before they became
aware of the disqualification
from the trust deed.
liquidator was also granted powers under s 479(3) of the

While challenging to
navigate, the lack of clarity surrounding the powers of a bare trustee is not
fatal. The courts still have the
statutory power to provide directions and
relief. In this way, the general law, when complemented by the statutory
overlay, creates
a workable framework which safeguards the trust property.
V CONCLUSION
Re Mad Canoe
, Lindgren J correctly observed that a trustee who has
been disqualified from holding office can continue to validly act as a bare
trustee. The duties and powers conferred by the trust deed no longer

trustees, disqualified trustees have no active duties, except those which exist

the trustee’s disqualification. Although, the
limited powers of the bare trustee could cause issues by restricting the trustee
from appropriately dealing with the trust property where a new trustee cannot be
appointed or in situations where a liquidator is
winding up the corporate

could leave the bare trustee
unsure as to whether they can validly act.

also excuse the trustee for any breaches of trust where the trustee acted

findings, it appears the overall

taken with the flexible
