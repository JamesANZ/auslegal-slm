STATE REVENUE OFFICE VICTORIA
Application of the anti-avoidance provisions
Revenue Ruling DT.010
Replaces DT.007
This ruling replaces Revenue Ruling
DT.007 and is effective from 1 January
Section 5(1)(c) of the
Debits Tax Act
(the Act) charges tax, in certain
circumstances, on each eligible debit of
not less than $1 made to an account
kept outside Victoria. Tax will be
imposed if the account holder (or one
of the account holders) is a resident of
Victoria and the account was used in
connection with the avoidance of
liability for payments of the tax that
would have been charged if the debit
had been made to an account kept in
Section 3(2) of the Act defines a
resident of Victoria at a particular time
1. a person (other than company)
who resided in Victoria at that
a company which was
incorporated in Victoria at that
time, or a company that carried
on its business in Victoria and
either had its central
management and control in
Victoria or had its voting power
controlled by shareholders who
were Victorian residents; or
3. a company being a partnership
or other unincorporated
association or body of persons,
which had a member who was
4. a Victorian resident at that
Section 5(2) of the Act also provides
that there is no avoidance if the debit is
made to an account which would
attract a liability to a similar tax at the
same rate as Victorian debits tax.
Following the announcement of the
abolition of debits tax in New South
Wales, this Office has received
numerous enquiries regarding the
application of section 5(1)(c) of the
Act. The purpose of this ruling is to
clarify the application of this provision.
Section 5(1)(c) of the Act is not
intended to apply to the legitimate use
of interstate accounts. In essence, it is
intended to impose tax on transactions
which the Commissioner of State
Revenue ( the Commissioner) has
reasonably concluded, having regard to
the surrounding circumstances, are
effected by means which avoid the
payment of debits tax in Victoria.

While it is not possible to identify
specific situations in which avoidance
would clearly be concluded, the
following factors will be considered by
the Commissioner in applying section
5(1)(c) of the Act:
1. the date of opening of the
2. the jurisdiction in which the
account is held and the rate of tax
applicable (if any);
3. the extent of any established
private and commercial interests in
that jurisdiction of the resident of
Victoria who would benefit from
any difference between the rate or
amount of tax payable in that
4. the existence of other accounts
held by the resident in other
established private and
commercial interests in those
5. the source of the funds deposited
to the account and the nature of
payments regularly made from the
6. any reasons which may be given to
the Commissioner for the account
being held outside Victoria and for
any specific payment, or payments,
being made from that account
rather than an account held in
Where the Commissioner determines
that the account was used for
avoidance purposes, an assessment will
be issued to the account holder in
accordance with Part 3 of the
Administration Act
In cases where it is not clear whether
section 5(1)(c) of the Act applies so as
to render an account holder liable to
pay debits tax under section 23(2), a
private ruling should be sought from
the State Revenue Office.
Please note that rulings do not have
the force of law. Each decision made
by the State Revenue Office is made on
the merits of each individual case
having regard to any relevant ruling. All
rulings must be read subject to
Revenue Ruling GEN.01.
