REASONS FOR DETERMINATION
Introduction
is a dispute about discovery in the worker’s referral under
Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988
(WRC Act). The worker
was employed by TasTAFE as a teacher and made a claim for compensation in
respect of a psychological injury.
His injury is related, in part, to
interpersonal conflict with a colleague, whom I will call Mr Z, culminating in a
physical altercation
between the two which led to the worker’s
worker seeks discovery of all documents relating to complaints about Mr Z,
including statements by co-workers, students, co-employees
and others. The
worker sought records that both pre-date and post-date the physical
altercation.
convenience, and for consistency with the approach taken by the parties, I use
the word ‘complaints’ to include complaints,
concerns, grievances,
grizzles and reports (that is, not limited to formal grievances).
submissions, the employer asserted that there were:
No documents relating to any previous complaint, grievance, grizzle, or anything
of the nature in respect of [Mr Z] prior to this
incident occurring.
worker accepted counsel’s assertion and does not press for further and
better discovery of complaints made prior to his
altercation. Accordingly, the
sole issue I need to decide is whether the employer must discover records of
complaints made after
the physical
altercation.
is addressed in the
Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Regulations 2021
(the Regulations). Regulation 6 states:
6. Discovery
(1) A party, by notice in writing served on any other
party, may request –
(a) discovery of any document or property that is
relevant to the issues in dispute in any application or referral; and
(b) a list of all documents discoverable
under paragraph (a); and
(c) disclosure of the location of those documents.
(2) A party on whom a notice is served
under subregulation (1) is to comply with the notice within 14
days after the date of service
of the notice or within any other period agreed
to by the parties.
(3) The Tribunal may order a party who has not complied
with subregulation (2) to make discovery
under subregulation (1) within any
period that the Tribunal
considers appropriate.
(4) If further documents that are discoverable
under subregulation (1)(a) come into the possession, custody or
control of a party
who has already made discovery, that party is to make further
discovery as soon as practicable.
(5) Any document in respect of which privilege is
claimed under any law is exempt from discovery.
(6) This regulation does not apply to a referral made
under section 81A of the Act, other than a referral made
under section 81A(5)
of the Act.
Glenorchy District Football Club Inc v C
[2019] TASWRCT 29
, the Workers
Rehabilitation and Compensation Tribunal said, at [25]:
Regulation 6(1)(a) permits a party to request discovery of documents relevant to
the issues in dispute in any application or referral.
To be relevant the
document must relate in some way to the matter in dispute and it has been held
Donaldson v Harris
(1973) 4 SASR 299
at 304 that relevance
will be established if the document sheds any light on the case or if it would
lead to a train of enquiry which
would either advance a party’s own case
or damage that of his adversary:
Mulley v Manifold
(1959) 103 CLR 341
those observations related to the 2011 Regulations, they are relevantly
identical to the 2021 Regulations and therefore the
observations equally applicable.
Which issues are
determine whether the records sought by the employer satisfy reg 6(1)(a), I need
to consider the issues that are relevant to the
worker’s s 42 referral.
The employer relies on three grounds for contending that the worker is not
entitled to compensation
under the WRC Act. The first is a factual dispute. The
second is whether the worker’s injury is attributable to his serious
wilful misconduct in engaging in the physical altercation with Mr Z. The third
is whether any injury arose substantially out
of reasonable action taken in a
reasonable manner by the employer to terminate the worker and/or reasonable
administrative action
taken in a reasonable manner.
request for further and better discovery is connected to the second ground. The
worker contends that his conduct is in issue and,
specifically, whether he
engaged in serious and wilful misconduct. The worker will not be entitled to
compensation if his injury
is “attributable to [his] serious and wilful
misconduct”: WRC Act, s 25(2)(a)(i).
worker relies on
Toll Transport Pty Ltd t/as Toll Tasmania v B
TASWRCT 19.
- [14], the Tribunal set out the test for serious and wilful
misconduct:
Hills v Brambles Limited
(supra) at [5] Green CJ made this
observation about conduct qualifying as serious and wilful:
conduct to amount to serious and wilful misconduct it must be such as to give
rise to an immediate risk of serious injury,
it must be deliberate and not
merely a thoughtless act done on the spur of the moment and it must be
accompanied by an appreciation
of the risk which is involved in it.”
Comcare v Calipari
[2001] FCA 1534
Finn J stated at [4]
that “serious injury” should signify “no more than the
converse of trivial injury. If it is
intended to signify more than that and to
postulate a positive requirement, it can find no justification in the terms of
the statute
itself nor in the general run of authoritative expositions of the
formula.” This criteria will be satisfied if the risk of
injury to the
worker is materially increased by her conduct.
14. In the case of
Sawle v Macadamia Processing Co Pty Ltd
[1999] NSWCC 26
[25] O’Meally J. states:
“Serious and wilful
misconduct is conduct beyond negligence, even beyond culpable or gross
negligence. In order to establish
serious and wilful misconduct, it must be
demonstrated that the person performing an act or suffering an omission knows it
risk of injury, or acts in disregard of consideration whether it will
cause injury. The word ‘wilful’ connotes that the
applicant must
have acted deliberately. As it seems to me, in order to establish serious and
wilful misconduct, a person accused
of it must be shown to have knowledge of the
risk of injury and, in light of that knowledge, proceeded without regard to the
It had been said that serious and wilful misconduct represented a higher stand
of misconduct than that which would justify immediate
dismissal. However, with
the changes to the industrial relations laws, immediate dismissal is now a thing
difficult to achieve.”
employer does not accept entirely the worker’s characterisation of his
case. It submits that:
worker’s claim form refers to stress caused by management action over
time, culminating in the physical altercation. However,
it seems to me that the
circumstances of the physical altercation are nonetheless relevant, not least
because it is the basis of
the employer’s reliance on the ‘serious
and wilful conduct’ defence in the WRC Act, s 25(2)(a)(i).
worker’s evidence in the s 81A referral did not suggest any apprehension
on his part about Mr Z’s propensity for aggression.
Although the
worker claims self-defence, he has “a bet each way” by relying on
his remorse and his conduct being an aberration
in respect of the physical
altercation which, I infer, would be inconsistent with self-defence.
In any event,
the worker’s conduct went beyond self-defence.
It would follow
that evidence of complaints made about Mr Z would not be relevant to the issues
in dispute.
submissions, I questioned counsel for the worker about the relevance of
complaints made about Mr Z
his physical altercation with the
worker. Counsel agreed that the relevance of any complaints would be akin to
tendency evidence.
That is, they may bolster an argument by the worker that it
was well known that Mr Z “had a temper
Consideration
some hesitation, I have concluded that records of complaints are discoverable.
The parties’ competing arguments are finely
balanced. I find the
employer’s characterisation of the worker’s case to be overly
narrow. For reasons which I will endeavour
to explain, Mr Z’s reputation
or propensity for aggression
be relevant. I do not think that, for
the purposes of discovery for a s 42 referral, the worker should be too
literally confined
to documents relied on as part of his claim for compensation.
I reject the employer’s submission that Mr Z’s behaviour
situations is irrelevant having regard to the worker’s characterisation of
his claim. Instead, I think that, at least
for the purposes of determining this
request for further and better discovery, the altercation must be considered as
a culminating
[2011] TASSC 1
, which the worker relies on, involved a request
for further and better discovery under the
Supreme Court Civil Procedure Act
(SCCPA). Blow J referred to the low threshold and discussed the
relevance of tendency evidence in an action for negligence by a medical
practitioner. I have found the case to be of minimal assistance. First, each
case will turn on its own facts depending on the issues
in dispute. Second, that

test for discovery under the SCCPA
appears to have narrowed over time,
consistent with a departure from “the expansive test identified in
Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v Peruvian Guano Company
[1883] UKLawRpKQB 95
(1882) 11 QBD 55
” by rules made under that Act:
Fingal Pastoral Pty
Ltd v Page Seager Lawyers (A Firm)
[2017] TASSC 24
. But the test
under reg 6 remains an expansive one. As the High Court said in
[1959] HCA 23
(1959) 103 CLR 341
[D]iscovery is a procedure directed towards obtaining a proper examination and
determination of these issues – not towards
assisting a party upon a
fishing expedition. Only a document which relates in some way to a matter in
issue is discoverable, but
it is sufficient if it would, or would lead to a
train of enquiry which would, either advance a party’s case or damage that
of his adversary.
Mr Z had a reputation or propensity for aggression may advance the
worker’s case by militating against the worker having
engaged in serious
and wilful misconduct by engaging in the altercation with Mr Z. The employer
concedes that the test for serious
and wilful misconduct requires an examination
of Mr Z’s state of mind. The worker contends that it might bolster an
that his action “might not have been out of
proportion”.
relevance is somewhat tenuous, limited as it is to evidence of reputation or
tendency, particularly where any complaints post-date
the physical altercation.
However, in these circumstances it meets the low threshold for discovery. That
said, this decision does
not mean that any such evidence would necessarily be
relevant (and admissible) on the hearing of the s 42 referral. That is a
worker’s application succeeds. I order that within 14 days, the employer
make discovery of all records in its possession
of complaints, however
described, made about Mr Z.
