Appellate Structure of the ACT Supreme Court
Committee Reference: CLRC No 14
The ACT established the Community Law Reform Committee
in July 1990.
The purpose of the Committee is to:
. help the Government to identify areas in need of reform;
. anticipate emerging social and legal issues; and
. assess the practical impact of various proposals and
laws on the people of the ACT.
The Committee's Secretariat is at 2nd floor, GIO Building,
City Walk, Canberra City, ACT 2601 (Tel (02) 62070546 fax (02) 62070538).

Appellate Structure of the ACT Supreme
Dear Attorney-General
This report examines the appellate structure of the ACT
Supreme Court.
While in part related to the Committee's reference on Rules
of the Court, the Committee has issued this report under the functions
the Committee as expressed in its
Constitution

Appellate Structure of the ACT Supreme
1 At present, appeals from the Supreme Court are heard by the Federal
Court of Australia and are governed by the
Federal Court of Australia
. This means that appeals are effectively taken out of the hands
of the Territory. This system involves several obvious disadvantages:
(a) The Territory government cannot maintain effective legislative control
over the appeal process. This means that any perceived
problem concerning
appeals from the Supreme Court can only be remedied by persuading the Commonwealth
Parliament to pass amending
legislation. This is cumbersome and time consuming.
Furthermore, it does not reflect the status of the Territory government
a separate body politic responsible to its own electors.
(b) The Territory government cannot maintain effective control over
the selection of judges who hear and determine appeals. Where
Federal Court
judges assist as additional judges of the Supreme Court they do so after
being offered commissions by the Territory
government and being allocated
cases by the Chief Justice of that Court. On the other hand, judges who
sit on the Full Court
do so without any appointment by the Territory government
and are allocated appeals by the Chief Justice of the Federal Court.
(c) The Federal Court generally has a different focus from the Supreme
Court. Consequently judges are frequently called upon to
decide appeals
on issues with which they have little familiarity. This is particularly
troubling in criminal matters where judges
may be forced to grapple not
only with unfamiliar principles but with issues relating to the exercise
of discretions to ensure
fairness in trials before juries and sentencing
'tariffs' both of which depend largely upon judicial experience. Furthermore,
if one ignores cross-vesting legislation, the Federal Court generally has
no nisi prius jurisdiction in personal injury cases.
These cases constitute
the bulk of the civil appeals and again involve issues of judgment, such
as the assessment of general
damages for pain and suffering, which are
dependent upon experience. Whilst it may seem inappropriate to cite examples
of this nature, there is an abundance of anecdotal evidence
to suggest that problems of this kind have caused not only excessive
and delay but more serious injustice.
(d) Furthermore, there is a perception that this lack of familiarity
can lead to a situation in which one resident judge exercises
disproportionate
influence over his less experienced colleagues and, in substance, there
is little more than an appeal from one
resident judge to another. Some
counsel believe that the prospects of succeeding on appeal are enhanced
by this situation in
which judicial rivalry may favour appellants. This
belief, coupled with the unpredictability inherent in the system, encourages
appeals of dubious merit.
(e) A further anomaly lies in the availability of appeals at least in
disciplinary matters from decisions of the Full Supreme Court
Federal Court. No analogous procedure exists anywhere else in Australia.
2. Whilst these problems have been generally acknowledged within the
profession for several years, there has been a perception that
of establishing an appellate division of the Supreme Court would be prohibitive.
In 1990 Lindsay Curtis AM suggested that
to sustain a Full Court within
the Supreme Court would require the availability of at least five and perhaps
six judges. However,
as Mr Curtis pointed out, that did not mean that one
would need to enlarge the pool of resident judges to five or six since some
or all of the existing visiting judges could be called upon to sit on appeals
in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. There
is no obvious reason
why more than four would be required.
3. With four resident judges it should be possible to have at least two
on most appeals. This should lead to more informed decisions
and greater
consistency.
4. There would be a number of options for the provision of further judges:
(a) Some of those who have already been appointed additional judges
of the Supreme Court could be asked to serve in the appellate
The co-operation of the Chief Justice of the Federal Court would be required
but the court would need to provide only
one judge per appeal instead of
the two or three sought under the present system. Whilst this might still
involve utilising some
judges of limited relevant experience, it would
not only narrow the field but enable the Territory to determine which judges
should be in that field.
(b) It might be possible to negotiate a reciprocal arrangement with
the Northern Territory where judges of each territory sat when
appeals in the other. This would have two potential advantages. Firstly,
the Northern Territory judges would have had
experience in the type of
cases under appeal and, indeed, the perspective of having had to determine
such cases in a self governing
territory. Hence, they would bring valuable
experience and understanding to the ACT appeals. Secondly, it might provide
experience for the ACT resident judges and reduce the risk of ACT
decisions becoming out of step with the those prevailing in other
and territory jurisdictions. Alternatively, it might be possible to reach
a similar agreement with one of the smaller states.
(c) Judges recently retired from, say, the Supreme Court of NSW might
be engaged on a daily or weekly basis. I understand that this
followed in the Fijian Court of Appeal and other jurisdictions. In a place
as conveniently located as Canberra it should
enable the selection of people
with appropriate experience.
5. Any decision to divert appeals from the jurisdiction of the Federal
Court to an ACT Court of Appeal would require amendments to
the Federal
Court Act as well as the
Supreme Court Act
. It will obviously be necessary
to discuss this matter with the Commonwealth Attorney General but it is
difficult to envisage any
logical objection.
6. The decision would involve some revenue considerations. On one hand
there would be some additional work which would have to be
absorbed by the
Supreme Court Registry. On the other hand, if the Supreme Court were to
follow the Federal Court practice of charging
fees for appeals some revenue
could be expected. It is difficult to provide a precise estimate of the
quatum of fees that might be
collected. However, in civil appeals the Federal
Court charges filing fees of $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for bodies
and hearing fees of $1,000 and $2,000 per day respectively. Pensioners
are not charged and no fees are payable for criminal appeals.
7. In the light of the above discussion, the Committee seeks your agreement
in principle to proceed to discussion with stakeholders
