Preliminary Matter
– Jurisdiction
Tribunal dismissed the application because it formed the view that it was
without jurisdiction to consider the application.
Tribunal draws its jurisdiction to review a power of attorney from the
of Attorney Act 2003
(NSW). As noted above, the power of attorney for which
review was sought was made under the
Powers of Attorney Act
a starting point the Tribunal was satisfied that
subsections 25(1)
(5) provide that an enduring power of attorney made under another
Powers of Attorney Act
(NSW) but operates subject to any limitations on the power that apply
under the law of the jurisdiction in which it was made and
does not operate to
confer any power on the attorney that would not be conferred under a power of
attorney made according to the
NSW legislation.
Tribunal took the preliminary view that
provides that an interstate
enduring power of attorney
should be treated as if it were an enduring
power of attorney made in NSW and, therefore, would arguably fit into the
definition in
(2) which provides jurisdiction for the
Tribunal to review an enduring power of attorney.
Powers of Attorney Act 2003
(NSW) provides that an enduring
power of attorney
is defined in
, which defines an enduring power of
attorney as an instrument that creates an enduring power of attorney
purposes of this Act
(emphasis added) and meets some requirements set out in
that section. The definition of an enduring power of attorney is not extended
enduring power of attorney which is defined separately by
for the purposes of recognition of the effect of an interstate enduring
power of attorney.
states that an interstate enduring power of attorney has effect in this
State as if it were an enduring power of attorney made under
and in compliance
with this Act, there is no provision in
or anywhere else expressly
extending interstate enduring powers of attorney into the powers of the Tribunal
of the Act which is the Part in which the review provisions
this reasoning, despite the provisions of
, which applies the
(emphasis added) of an interstate power of attorney, a
added) of an enduring power of attorney made under interstate jurisdiction would
not be within the jurisdiction of this
Tribunal as the interstate enduring power
of attorney is not included in the definition of enduring powers of attorney
the instruments that are reviewable by the Tribunal.
interpretation is strengthened by a consideration of a hypothetical circumstance
in which the Tribunal were requested to review
the making of an interstate
enduring power of attorney on validity grounds.
Section 36(3)(b)(ii)
Powers of Attorney Act 2003
(NSW) requires that in conducting such a
review, the Tribunal must decide whether or not the order complies with the
requirements
of “this Act” being the
Powers of Attorney Act
(NSW). This could not be the case where the order is made under the
act of another jurisdiction.
tribunal therefore decided, on balance, that it was without jurisdiction to
review the enduring power of attorney made Mr THQ
on 6 July 2006 pursuant to
Powers of Attorney Act
(Qld). Accordingly the
Tribunal dismissed the application.
