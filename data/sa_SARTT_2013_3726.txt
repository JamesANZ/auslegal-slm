Mugridge v South Australian Housing Trust [2013] SARTT 3726 (3 December 2014)
REASONS FOR ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL MADE ON 3 DECEMBER
Hearing 3 December 2014 at Adelaide
MUGRIDGE V SOUTH AUSTRALIAN HOUSING TRUST
(RT13/3726)
Application by the South Australian Housing Trust for vacant possession on
the basis that the tenant is in breach of the terms and
conditions of her
tenancy due to a property in a deceased estate being transmitted into her name
as an executor of the deceased estate.
The tenant also had a significant
beneficial interest in the property. The RTT held that because of the length of
time taken to dispose
of the property and therefore the length of time for which
the tenant was in breach, the tenancy should be terminated.
This is the determination of an application lodged on 26 November 2014 by the
tenant seeking to vary or set aside an order of the
Tribunal made on 31 October
Sworn or affirmed evidence was given at the hearing by:
The landlord’s representatives: Todd Wierenga; Christine
The tenant: Bernadette Mugridge
The tenant was assisted by Ms Alison Randle from TIAS.
I refer to the order of the Tribunal made on 31 October 2014. That order
required the tenant to vacate the property on 1 December
Section 32(1)
Residential Tenancies Act 1995
(the Act) enables the
Tribunal to vary or set aside a previous order of the Tribunal if it considers
there are "proper grounds for
McNickle v White & White (no.2)
[2006] SADC 43
Tilmouth said that “proper grounds” should not be limited to
exceptional circumstances, and this approach was confirmed
by His Honour Judge
Rice & Dawson v Szlegel
[2009] SADC 27
His Honour noted...
"It is self-evident that 'proper grounds' for a variation of orders may
arise in a wide variety of circumstances".
The tenant has been living in her Trust property since 1998. She was one of
the executors named in the will of Una Mercier McMahon
deceased (the Deceased).
The Deceased died on 24 May 2011 and probate of her will was granted to the
tenant and Mary Hicks on 25
October 2011.
One of the assets in the Deceased’s estate was a house property at 7
Vintage Road Underdale. That property was transmitted into
the names of the
executors on 1 August 2012.
As one of the executors of the Deceased’s estate, the tenant’s
interest in the property at Underdale is one of legal ownership
only. However,
under the terms of the Deceased’s will the tenant is entitled to half the
proceeds of sale of the property.
Therefore the tenant also had a beneficial
interest in the property.
The Underdale property was sold on 31 October 2014. The sale price was
$495,000. Ms Mugridge has received approximately $240,000 from
the proceeds of
Clause 10 of the tenancy agreement states:-
“ The tenant acknowledges that Trust tenancies are for the benefit
of tenants who have no interest in any other residential
property, and agrees
that, if he/she acquires any direct or indirect interest in any other
residential property, he/she will:-
the Trust full and correct written information with regard to that interest,
vacant possession of the premises to the Trust if the Trust exercises the right
set out in Condition 5(d) to terminate the tenancy
after giving not less than 14
days written notice.”
On 14 March 2014 the Trust gave the tenant notice to quit her
property on 3 April 2014.
Ms Mugridge sought a review of this decision by the Housing Appeals Panel.
The Panel heard the appeal on 13 May 2014 and made an order
on that day which
upheld the Trust’s decision to terminate the tenancy. However, the Panel
directed the Trust to “..
reconsider the vacation of premises date if Ms
Mugridge provides further information to the Trust by 13 June
The Trust then applied to the Tribunal for an order for possession. The
Tribunal conducted hearings on 2 July 2014, 28 July 2014 and
11 August 2014. At
a fourth hearing on 22 September 2014 the Tribunal made an order that the tenant
vacate the property on 4 November
On 24 October 2014 the tenant applied to vary that order. On 31 October 2014
the Tribunal made an order by consent, that the tenant
would vacate the property
on 1 December 2014.
The tenant now seeks an order to vary or set aside that order.
Consideration of the application
Ms Randle submitted that:-
Now that the
property has been sold, the tenant no longer has an interest in real estate and
so she should be permitted to remain
in the property;
Ms Mugridge was
unable to reside in the property at Underdale because of a dispute in the
Mugridge’s agreement to vacate at the previous hearing was based on an
assumption that when she received the proceeds of
sale of the Underdale
property, she would be able to obtain a loan from the bank so that she could
purchase a house to live in;
Subsequently the
bank advised that a loan would not be approved because of the tenant’s
debt to the Trust – that has now
been paid off;
The Bank then
advised that they would not grant a loan to Ms Mugridge until she established a
savings pattern and so she has placed
the net proceeds of sale from the
Underdale property in an account with the Bank for that to occur – this
will take some time;
Ms Mugridge has
significant medical conditions and she does not drive and so she is limited in
the area in which she can live –
it must be within a reasonable distance
of the Flinders Medical Centre;
It would be
appropriate to allow Ms Mugridge a further 6 months to find suitable
accommodation (should the Tribunal decide that she
must vacate at all).
Mr Wierenga submitted that:-
The tenant was
in breach of her tenancy agreement for a significant amount of time – from
the time she became the executor of
the Deceased’s estate in October
She did not take
appropriate steps to either advise the Trust of her interest or dispose of it in
a reasonable period;
Since the sale
of the property Ms Mugridge has significant cash at her disposal which she can
use towards different accommodation;
Ms Mugridge is
not considering all of the options available to her in relation to alternative
accommodation and that is unreasonable;
In particular Ms
Mugridge wants to buy one particular house and she should be looking at other
possibilities – in particular
the possibility of agreeing to initially
renting a property with a view to subsequently buying it;
Ms Mugridge has
had ample time to make alternative arrangements and the Trust now seeks
possession of the property but will agree
to leave Ms Mugridge in the property
for a short time longer provided she pays rent.
Conclusions and findings
The order made on 10 November 2014 which required Ms Mugridge to vacate on 1
December 2014 was an order by consent. It is unusual
to entertain an application
to vary or set aside an order where the parties have agreed on it. However, in
this case because of the
unusual circumstances, I will entertain the
application.
I accept Ms Mugridge’s evidence that at this point she has not been
able to obtain bank finance for the purchase of another
house. I consider it
highly likely that this was a fundamental assumption made by her when she agreed
to vacate the property on 1
December 2014. As that has not occurred, I consider
this constitutes a proper ground for me to consider varying or setting aside
previous Tribunal order, even taking into account the fact that it was made by
Should Ms Mugridge be required to vacate at all and if so when should that
Ms Randle submitted that as Ms Mugridge is no longer in breach, then she
should not be required to vacate. Mr Wierenga and Ms Schultze
opposed that
submission and stated that Ms Mugridge had been in breach of her agreement for
an extensive period, and she now had
the funds to enable her to find alternative
accommodation.
I agree with the Trust’s submissions. If Ms Mugridge had only been an
executor of the will, I would not require her to vacate.
However, she received
half of the net proceeds of the property and that was a significant sum. In
addition, she took on the role
of executor from the date of the Deceased’s
death and that role was confirmed by the grant of probate. From
May 2011 Ms Mugridge had an interest in the
Underdale property. It took until October this year for the property to be sold.
The property
was rented out for some of this time. I consider that the length of
time during which the property was held in the estate was unusually
has been beneficially entitled to half the Underdale property for all of that
time. Therefore the period during which Ms
Mugridge was in breach of her tenancy
agreement was considerable.
The purpose of public housing is to assist those in need. Ms Mugridge now has
access to substantial funds to provide for her accommodation.
Therefore I consider it is appropriate for the tenancy to be terminated.
I consider that the Trust and the Tribunal have been particularly patient in
allowing Ms Mugridge to continue living in the property
up until now. The
Tribunal has conducted a number of hearings to allow for the property to be sold
and for there to be more certainty
concerning Ms Mugridge’s circumstances.
Ms Mugridge has been that she may be required to vacate the property since
March this year. The first order for possession was made
on 4 November 2014.
This has already been changed once.
Taking into account all of the circumstances I will allow Ms Mugridge to
remain in the property until Friday 27 February 2015 but
she must vacate then.
I set aside the order of the Tribunal made on 10 November 2014and
substitute the following order instead
The tenant must move out of the premises by midday on Friday 27 February
2015 but if the tenant does not move out this order may
only be enforced by the
Tribunal bailiff.
