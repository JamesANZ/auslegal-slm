Introduction
offender, Emma Louise Morton, has pleaded guilty to three counts of theft
contrary to s 308 of the
Criminal Code 2002
(ACT) (CAN 343/2025; CAN
344/2025; CAN 345/2025).
maximum penalty for each offence is 10 years’ imprisonment or 1,000
penalty units (equivalent to $160,000).
offender now comes before the Court to be sentenced for these
The offending
27 February 2020 and 18 February 2021, the offender was employed as the Director
of Projects on Parkinson Ltd (POP Ltd), a
charity which operated the Weston
Creek Children’s Centre (the Centre). As at February 2021, the offender
had held that position
for 22 years.
this period, the offender transferred funds from bank accounts held in the name
of POP Ltd to personal and joint bank accounts
in her own name, as well as to
accounts held in the name of third parties. The offender also used a debit card
linked to POP Ltd’s
bank account to make purchases for goods and services
that were for the benefit of herself, rather than the Centre. The total value
the property obtained by the offender was $305,785.36.
The financial affairs of
Ltd maintained two bank accounts with St George Bank. The first bank account was
used as an operating account, and was used for
both payments and expenses. The
second account was used as a savings account.
debit card function was linked to the operating account. The card issued for
that account was issued in the name of “Emma
Morton POP”. The card
was kept by the offender, except when it was provided to a staff member to
purchase an item or when left
at the Centre for use while the offender was away.
There was no company policy regulating the card’s use.
Ltd’s operating account could be accessed via an online banking system. To
use the online system to make transfers, a user
was required to obtain a
security number from a token linked to the account. As at February 2021, only
the offender and an administrative
assistant, Ms Goodwin, had access to the
online banking system. The offender predominantly had access to the token,
except on Tuesdays
when Ms Goodwin would use the token to process payroll.
Ltd used the business and accounting software MYOB to create entries for the
purposes of reconciling the operating and savings
accounts, and for producing
profit and loss statements. An entry created in MYOB would include details such
as whether the expense
was incurred via the debit card or electronic transfer,
the account the expense was linked to, and a description of the expense.
The methodology of the
of the three offences in this matter relate to multiple instances of theft. The
three counts relate to three distinct methodologies
used by the offender to
commit the theft:
(a) Count 1:
Theft committed by using the online banking system to
transfer funds from POP Ltd’s operating account to a bank account held
the offender’s name, a bank account held jointly by the offender and
another person, or a bank account held by a third party.
These transactions
involved inserting details of a false or misleading payee, or a false or
inaccurate payment description, including
in the MYOB entries. Count 1
consists of 26 separate transactions totalling $141,084.73.
(b) Count 2:
Theft committed by receiving a telegraphic transfer from POP
Ltd’s savings account to a bank account held or controlled by the
The accused then assumed the rights of the property without the consent of POP
Ltd, and dealt with the property regardless
of the rights of POP Ltd. Count 2
consists of three separate transactions totalling $130,000.00.
(c) Count 3:
Theft committed by using the debit card linked to POP
Ltd’s operating account to purchase goods and services which were not
the benefit of POP Ltd. Count 3 consists of 106 separate transactions totalling
$34,700.63.
transactions which constitute each of these counts are summarised in Annexure A
to this judgment.
last financial audit of the Centre was completed in around September 2019. In
June 2020, the Cente’s auditor contacted the
offender regarding the audit
for the 2019 – 2020 financial year. The offender informed the auditor that
POP Ltd would not be
undertaking an audit that year.
The discovery of the thefts
and the arrest of the offender
2019, concerns were raised with the offender regarding certain purchases that
were being made with the debit card that had
been issued to the offender. The
offender agreed that she had made the relevant purchases, but did not provide
any further details
concerning the circumstances in which those purchases were
made. On 14 October 2020, a complaint was made to the Australian Federal
police investigation into the financial irregularities commenced in January
2021. On 26 February 2021, members of the AFP executed
a search warrant at the
offender’s home. During the course of the execution of this search
warrant, the offender was arrested.
offender was bail refused from 26 February 2021 to 10 March 2021. She spent
13 days in custody prior to release on bail.
The Victim Impact
Victim Impact Statement was provided by the administrative assistant, Ms Kylie
Goodwin. Ms Goodwin had been a part of the Weston
Creek Children’s
Centre community for over 20 years, both as a parent and as an employee. She was
the person who made the initial
report to the AFP concerning the financial
her Victim Impact Statement, Ms Goodwin explained that she was the only person
who could see the offender’s thefts “in
real time”, and this
has put her in an “extremely vulnerable and isolating position”. She
stated that the experience
had left her feeling “deeply betrayed, angry,
upset and emotionally drained”. The emotional toll had been
“significant
and long-lasting”. Ms Goodwin and other staff members
of the Centre have required counselling to process these impacts.
Goodwin said that she had questioned the offender about her actions several
times, and that the offender had lied to her and “made
[her] feel as
though [she] was in the wrong for even asking”. She noted that “what
was taken was not just money it was
trust, security, and the wellbeing of a
whole community”. She said that the offender’s actions had
“left a huge
negative impact on [her] and the Centre, which [they] are
still dealing with reputationally and financially to this day”.
Counsel for the offender queried whether Ms Goodwin is a “victim”
within the meaning of
Crimes (Sentencing) Act 2005
although he did not formally object to the admission of her statement.
defines a victim as “a person who suffers harm because of an
offence”. Noting the broad text and beneficial purpose of
the provision, I
find that Ms Goodwin was a person who has suffered “harm” as a
result of the offence, and that the victim
impact statement was properly
received. I note that the prosecution does not rely on the Victim Impact
Statement to form any findings
in aggravation of the offence.
The offender’s subjective
The offender’s
offender’s background is set out in detail in an expert psychiatric report
provided by Dr Jeremy O’Dea dated 3 October
2025 and in an Intensive
Corrections Order Assessment Report (ICOAR) dated 7 October 2025.
offender was born in Sydney, and grew up in Adelaide, the United States of
America and Canberra. The offender’s parents
separated when she was a
teenager. The offender described her father as a “really really tough
man” who had been an alcoholic.
She said that her mother was a “very
difficult woman” who had suffered from depression and anxiety. The
offender has
a younger sister whom she currently has no relationship with. She
has three children, all of whom are now adults, with her ex-husband,
separated from in early 2020.
his report, Dr O’Dea noted that the offender had a stressful childhood and
first marriage. From 2013, the offender’s
ex-husband had become
controlling and emotionally abusive. The offender’s ex-husband was an
alcoholic. Both the offender and
her son have spoken of his regular use of
“hideous” pornography sites. The offender’s ex-husband was
violent towards
her and her eldest son. He tracked her movements and treated her
with derision and disrespect.
December 2013, the offender’s mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
The offender became her mother’s carer during
this time. The offender also
became estranged from her father, as they had come into conflict regarding her
mother’s treatment.
As a result, the offender has not contacted her father
in over a decade.
offender’s mother died in early 2014. In February 2014, the
offender’s eldest son was diagnosed with Ewing’s
potentially terminal form of bone cancer. The offender herself was diagnosed
with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
in 2016. The offender reported to Dr
O’Dea that her mental health deteriorated during this period, and she was
one of [her] kids would get a condition and die”.
2019, the offender’s ex-husband became more abusive to the offender and
her eldest son. The offender was “frightened
all the time of what [her
ex-husband] was going to do”. In August 2019, the offender began receiving
treatment for an anxiety
disorder. A contemporaneous record from the
offender’s treating doctor at the time, Dr Christopher Ayers, noted the
We are currently treating [the offender] for illness anxiety disorder but
I’m also wondering whether she may have features
in keeping with PTSD.
Over the past few months [the offender] has become significantly functionally
impaired with pervasive, unrelenting
thoughts of death and illness in relation
to herself or her family.
Ayers also reported the impacts of the offender’s eldest son’s
illness upon her:
[S]everal years ago, [the offender’s] eldest son (now 19) was diagnosed
with osteosarcoma. He has gone through surgery and
radiotherapy and is
fortunately in remission. His follow-up has become much less intense since the
start of the year. It appears
that this has triggered a dramatic worsening in
[the offender’s] mental health. [The offender] originally presented
approximately
two years ago essentially non-functioning. She was dysthymic,
emotionally dysregulated, weeping constantly and unable to go to work
part in normal activities of daily living.
Sadly, there has been a steady deterioration over the last few months, [the
offender] retains persistent negative thoughts regarding
ill-health.
14 January 2020 to 13 February 2020, the offender was admitted to the Hyson
Green Psychiatric Unit. This was approximately a
month before the commencement
of the offending. She was admitted with “generalized anxiety disorder, low
mood, sleep disturbance
within context of health issues”. The
offender’s discharge summary noted that her mental state had improved over
course of her admission.
offender separated from her ex-husband following her discharge from Hyson Green.
She was referred to an outpatient program for
further treatment, however the
program had ceased due to COVID-19 restrictions. The offender’s continuing
treatment involved
consultations with her General Practitioner and psychiatrist,
mainly via telephone and Zoom.
The offender’s mental
health diagnoses
O’Dea diagnosed the offender as suffering from a Major Depressive Disorder
with “significant PTSD style symptoms that
became more acute through
2019”. Dr O’Dea also noted the complications with ongoing community
treatment of the offender’s
condition, due to COVID-19 restrictions. Dr
O’Dea considered that it was “reasonable to assume” that the
Major Depressive Disorder was active at the time of her
offending, and that she was suffering a “significant mood
disturbance”
during that time.
O’Dea expressed the opinion that the offender’s condition may have
had a “significant impact upon her overall
cognition, judgment and
behavioural control” during the time of the offending. However, he
I am not in a position to directly link, in a causal manner, her Depressive
Disorder to the index offences, or conclude that by virtue
of her Major
Depressive Disorder, she did not know the nature or quality of her conduct in
relation to the index offences, could
not reason with a moderate degree of sense
and composure about whether the conduct in relation to the index offences, as
a reasonable person, was wrong, or could not control her actions in
relation to the index offences.
two letters each dated 14 January 2025, the offender’s treating medical
professionals also expressed concerns regarding the
impact of incarceration on
the offender’s mental health. Ms Nicole Jones, a clinical psychologist,
assessed the offender in
September 2024 and found that she met the criteria for
Complex PTSD (CPTSD). Ms Jones noted that she had “significant clinical
concerns” that incarceration would lead to “heightened stress and
anxiety and due to her history of suicidal ideation,
there is a substantial risk
of self harm”. Similarly, Dr Ayers said that he had “serious
concerns” that a custodial
sentence would create a “significant risk
of severe deterioration in [the offender’s] mental health”,
a “substantial risk that she may cause harm to herself in a
custodial setting”.
The offender’s
physical health
offender has been treated for chronic spinal pain since 2023. In a letter dated
15 January 2025, the offender’s chiropractor
noted that the
offender’s anxiety and past trauma were contributing factors to her
physical condition. The offender’s
chiropractor stated that regular
treatments were required to manage the offender’s condition, and that
“[e]nsuring continuity
in [the offender’s] treatment plan is
important for maintaining multiple areas of her well-being”.
offender has multiple post school qualifications, including in childcare,
teaching, educational leadership, management and counselling.
Following her
arrest, the offender took on some short-term employment positions in
administration, before founding a business in
counselling, mentoring and
business coaching.
references were provided on behalf of the offender from the offender’s
husband and five of her friends. All of the
character references speak of the
offender’s good character. The offender’s husband described the
offender as “at
her core, a deeply good and caring person”. Her
friends state that the offender was a “person of integrity”, and
that the offending was “entirely out of character”.
character references also outline the impacts of the offender’s traumatic
background on the offender. The offender’s
husband stated the offender had
been profoundly impacted by various events in her life, including her eldest
son’s cancer diagnosis.
One of the offender’s friends noted that
these traumatic events put the offender under “immense emotional
which “helps to explain, though not justify, the
uncharacteristic decisions she made”.
character references also addressed the offender’s mental health
struggles. For example, the offender’s husband noted
that the offender
“has always been open about the challenges she faces and the importance of
addressing them”. He stated
that, since the offender’s release from
custody, she has made positive progress in managing her condition. He noted that
willingness to engage in this process is a reflection of her
strength, resilience and desire to continue growing as a
ICOAR Report
the offender’s Intensive Corrections Order Assessment Report (ICOAR), the
offender was assessed as having a low risk of general
reoffending. The ICOAR
author noted that the offender had multiple protective factors, including no
prior criminal history; pro-social
support from family and friends; stable
accommodation; employment; and an absence of problematic alcohol or substance
use. The offender’s
primary risk factors related to her history of mental
health issues, arising from the traumatic events in the offender’s
and marriage.
offender was assessed as suitable for an Intensive Corrections Order (ICO). The
author noted that Corrective Services would monitor
the offender’s
engagement with mental health treatment if she was sentenced to an ICO.
Determination
very helpful oral submissions, the prosecutor informed the Court there were no
significant questions of principle between the parties,
and that the primary
areas of divergence concerned the application of those principles and the weight
to be given to various sentencing
considerations.
matters of divergence concerned:
(i) The nature and circumstances of the offending;
(ii) Whether the offender has demonstrated remorse for the offences;
(iii) The weight to be given to the offender’s mental illness;
(iv) The significance of the hardship to the offender’s son which would be
occasioned by the imposition of a custodial term
of imprisonment;
(v) The offender’s prospects of rehabilitation;
(vi) The weight to be given to the fact that the offender had repaid the funds
(vii) The significance of the delay in the proceedings; and
(viii) The reduction of the sentence to be afforded as a result of the
offender’s plea of guilty.
is convenient to address each of these matters before turning to the appropriate
sentence to be imposed.
The nature and
circumstances of the offending
offending was repeated, and consisted of a large number of transactions, over a
long period of time. In total, there were 135
transactions occurring over an
11-month period. Count 1 consists of 26 separate transactions totalling
$141,084.73 over a 10-month
period; count 2 consists of 3 separate transactions
totalling $130,000 over a 6-week period; and count 3 consists of 106 separate
transactions totalling $34,700.63 over an 11-month period. The offending only
ceased when it was discovered.
breach of trust involved in the offending was egregious. The offender was the
Director of a not-for-profit childcare centre. It
may readily be inferred that
an organisation of this nature does not hold an excess of funds: see similarly
[2017] ACTSC 317
. It may also be inferred that the funds
that were available had been obtained by childcare fees, paid for by parents,
who may themselves
have been struggling to make ends meet. The funds were
required to pay hardworking staff, and to provide for the early education
very young children.
offending was brazen. However, I do not accept the offender’s submission
that the offending was “doomed to be easily
discovered”. The fact
that the transactions were “easily traceable” meant nothing unless
there was a real prospect
that the accounts would be scrutinised. This was not a
multinational company. As the offender well knew, she was one of only two
persons who had access to the centre’s banking system. She told the
auditor that an audit was not required. The offending,
which occurred over an
11-month period, only came to light as a result of the diligence and courage of
Ms Goodwin, who was her subordinate.
the funds taken by the offender were not used to make discretionary purchases
such as high-end luxury items, cars or holidays,
the record of transactions set
out in Annexure A indicates that the offending was not entirely motivated by
“need”. Whilst
some of the transactions were for basic items such as
medication and accommodation during the offender’s separation from her
partner, other transactions were made at David Jones for items such as clothes,
cosmetics, candles and jewellery. The overall impression
is that the offender
was using the child care centre’s funds as her own personal bank account,
to be used for whatever purposes
suited her at the time.
not sophisticated, the offending for count 1 involved deception. False details
were provided for many of the transactions which
gave the transactions an
appearance of legitimacy. For example, one transfer made by the offender on 10
March 2020 had the payment
description “reimburse for traincou
[sic]”. The corresponding MYOB entry noted that this transfer was for
Training & Seminar”, and the payee was listed as
“Health Academy”. Another transfer made on 4 June 2020 had
entry describing it as a payment for “Equipment Repl., Toys”, with
the payee being “Modern Teaching Aids”.
funds that were the subject of count 2 were transferred to an account which was
controlled by the offender, and were not spent.
In his written submissions,
senior counsel for the offender submitted that “the motive for the
offending [the subject of count
2] was a misguided attempt address the risks
that arose during the COVID 19 pandemic rather than any act of personal
enrichment”.
I do not accept this submission. As the prosecutor submitted,
inherent in the offender’s plea is an acknowledgment that the
knew that her conduct was wrong at the time that she engaged in it. I find that
in moving the funds which are the subject
of count 2, the offender was acting to
ensure that she would retain access to the Centre’s funds for her own
personal use in
the future. Nonetheless, as the prosecutor acknowledged, the
offending in count 2 was less objectively serious than count 1 because
was not spent by the offender. Whilst count 3 involved a large number of
transactions, it also concerned the smallest total
assess count 1 as the most serious of the three charges. I consider counts 2 and
3 of equal objective seriousness, particularly
noting that while the funds in
count 2 were not in fact spent by the offender, count 3 involved a large number
of transactions over
a lengthy period.
outlined above, the offender has been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder
with PTSD style symptoms. The offender had been
previously diagnosed with PTSD
as well as an anxiety disorder. The prosecution did not challenge the
offender’s diagnosis,
or its connection to the offending. The prosecution
appropriately accepted that the offender’s mental health is such as to
render her experience of custody more onerous.
prosecution also accepted that the offender’s mental health is such as to
require that there be some moderation of the weight
to be given to general
deterrence and denunciation. The issue between the parties concerned the extent
of the moderation that should
be afforded.
McBride v The King
[2025] ACTCA 16
, the Court of Appeal held that a
“direct causative link” was not required for a mental condition to
reduce an offender’s
moral culpability: at [126]. However, the Court also
held (at [128] – [129]):
... it must also be borne in mind that a finding of reduced moral culpability
does not necessarily require the weight to be given
to general or specific
deterrence to be reduced or eliminated: [
[2025] VSCA 60
It is “erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though
automatic consequences follow from the presence
or absence of particular factual
circumstances”:
(1995) 84 A Crim R 67
at [68], quoted in
Munda v Western Australia
[2013] HCA 38
249 CLR 600
. Each case
will depend upon its own facts. As Nettle JA (as his Honour then was) observed
[2007] VSCA 119
; 16 VR 349 at
, “[t]he theory and
reality upon which the intuitive synthesis approach to sentencing is built is
that each case is unique”.
As explained by the Victorian Court of Appeal in
, whether the
weight to be given to general and/or specific deterrence should be moderated
depends upon the nature and severity of
the symptoms exhibited by the offender,
and the effect of the condition on the mental capacity of the offender: see also
at [65]. Of particular relevance to this assessment will be whether
the mental condition affected the offender’s capacity to
understand the
wrongfulness of their conduct:
at [65]. Where an offender’s
mental illness is such that the offender is not an appropriate medium for making
an example to
others, the weight to be given to general deterrence may be
reduced, potentially significantly so: see similarly
at [62], citing
(Full Court of Supreme Court of Victoria, unreported, 21 June
R v Anderson
[1981] VicRp 17
[1981] VR 155.
the present case, the offender’s mental health at the time of the
offending had a significant impact upon her overall cognition,
judgment and
behavioural control. The weight to be given to denunciation and general
deterrence should be reduced. However, the offender
was still able to function
as Director of the Centre, despite her illness. In view of the duration of the
offending, the large sums
of money that were stolen, and the acute breach of
trust that was committed against a not-for-profit organisation, I do not find
that her condition was such that there should be a substantial reduction in the
weight to be given to these purposes.
the prosecutor noted, some aspects of the offender’s statement of remorse
are somewhat equivocal, and suggest that the offender
has minimised the
seriousness of her offending, both to herself and to others. For example, Dr
O’Dea reported that the offender
had accepted that she “made
mistakes” and said that “if I was in a better state at the time [I
would have done
things differently]”.
the ICOAR records that the offender reported that “in hindsight, she may
have followed incorrect processes and procedures
in relation to counts 1 and 3,
which she had been unaware of at the time”. She declined to discuss count
3 in detail, other
than to say that she “may” have used the company
credit card to purchase “some non-work-related items, which she
remorseful for”. In relation to Count 2, the offender told the ICOAR
author that she had been “advised to create
a Covid-19 account by her
superiors and never intended to use the funds for her personal use”. As
stated above, I do not accept
this explanation, which is inconsistent with the
offender’s acknowledgment, via her plea, that the offender knew that her
was wrong at the time that she engaged in it.
the ICOAR author also reported that the offender had said she was “deeply
sorry for her actions and the impact they
caused to others at the company and
was willing to make any necessary repayments”. Additionally, several of
the offender’s
character references speak of the offender’s remorse,
with one friend stating that the offender had expressed “desperation,
shame, sorrow, angst and remorse” in regard to the offending.
balance, I find that the offender has some remorse for her conduct.
Prospects of
rehabilitation/ risk of re-offending
divergence in the parties’ positions concerning the offender’s
prospects of rehabilitation and risk of re-offending
narrowed substantially
during the course of oral submissions.
for the offender submitted that the offender had “outstanding prospects of
rehabilitation” and a low likelihood
of reoffending. Counsel for the
prosecution did not agree the offender had “outstanding” prospects
of rehabilitation,
but did not submit that her prospects were
“poor”. However, he conceded that the offender’s prospects of
rehabilitation
were “better today” than at the time the offending
into account the absence of any prior criminal history, the offender’s
compliance with her bail conditions, and her other
protective factors, such as a
stable relationship with her husband, mental health treatment, and employment, I
find that the offender
has good prospects of rehabilitation.
outlined above, there is evidence that the offender’s son is at
significant risk of self-harm or suicide if others are not
available to support
a psychological assessment by Dr Jenna Bollinger dated 30 September 2025, the
offender’s son reported that not having his
mother around would be
“very, very, very, very difficult”. Dr Bollinger expressed the view
that the offender’s
son may “[decompensate] quite rapidly” if
the offender was incarcerated for an extended period of time. This is a matter
which must be taken into account when determining the proper sentence to be
imposed: see
Crimes (Sentencing) Act 2005
Weight to be given to
was informed that all of the funds which were stolen by the offender have now
been, or are in the process of being, repaid. This
is a matter which is relevant
when assessing the harm which has been caused by the offending.
the context in which the repayment was made must also be taken into account. The
offender’s assets had been seized
following the police investigation.
Prior to the sentencing proceedings, the offender had consented to an
application for an exclusion
order to permit the funds stolen to be returned to
the Centre. If the offender had not so consented, the funds stolen may have been
forfeited to the ACT Government, rather than being returned to the Centre. In
those circumstances, the present case is not one where
the repayment of property
taken is such as to demonstrate remorse, or to involve any additional hardship
to, or sacrifice on behalf
of the offender; cf
Subramaniam v The Queen
[2013] NSWCCA 159
offender was first arrested on 26 February 2021. She was committed for trial on
16 June 2023. The proceedings were listed for
trial in the Supreme Court on
three occasions; however, a trial was not reached on any occasion. A trial date
was eventually set
for 3 June 2025. The offender pleaded guilty
approximately three weeks before the commencement of the trial, on 14 May 2025.
for the offender submitted that the delay of this time was
“inordinate”. Counsel for the prosecution noted that
approximately
nine months of the delay was due to the offender’s unsuccessful challenge
of her committal to the Supreme Court.
divergence in the parties’ positions concerning the significance of delay
also narrowed during the course of oral submissions.
It was common ground that
the offender should receive the benefit of her demonstrated rehabilitation which
she has undertaken since
charges were laid. In the offender’s written
submissions, it was additionally submitted that the delay should operate as a
“significant mitigating feature on sentence” and should enliven
“substantial flexibility in the approach to the
sentence”. In oral
submissions, however, it was noted that the “real point” was the
offender’s rehabilitation
during this period of delay.
accept that the delay in the resolution of these proceedings is relevant in that
it has enabled the offender to demonstrate her
rehabilitation. I do not accept
that the delay otherwise operates to mitigate the sentence to be
offender pleaded guilty on 14 May 2025, which was approximately three weeks
prior to the commencement of the trial. The plea of
guilty was entered to a
fresh indictment and on a substantially different factual basis to that which
had originally been charged.
the call-over for this matter, Chief Justice McCallum made the following
comments regarding the offender’s guilty plea:
... in the context of this callover, the indication of a plea today as opposed
to on 3 June... is of greater utilitarian value to
the court that if it had been
withheld until the first day of the trial.
parties agreed that the plea had utilitarian value, particularly as it was
entered at a time when there was particular strain
on the judicial resources of
this Court. The offender’s guilty plea prevented the need for a lengthy
trial at this time.
the Chief Justice made clear, the timing of the plea was of significant
utilitarian value. I will afford the offender a 15% reduction
in the sentences
to be imposed in recognition of the offender’s pleas of guilty.
The appropriate
summary, the offending was serious. It was protracted, and was constituted by
numerous transactions over a long period of time.
The offending represented a
grievous breach of the trust that was reposed in the offender.
funds taken have been, or are in the process of being, repaid. The financial
harm caused by the offending has not been permanent.
However, the effects of
offending of this nature are not limited to financial loss. The offender’s
conduct breached the trust
that the parents and employees of the Centre had
reposed in her. This breach of this trust itself occasioned harm, to the
staff and children of the Centre, and to the broader community. This
harm, whilst not quantifiable in dollars and cents, must equally
be recognised
by the law.
motive of the offending is unclear, other than to say that the offender’s
mental illness and the circumstances of her separation
from her ex-husband had a
significant impact upon her overall cognition, judgment and behavioural control
during the time of the
offending. The weight to be given to denunciation and
general deterrence will be somewhat moderated by reason of this matter. However,
for the reasons outlined above, the extent of this moderation is not
substantial. It remains necessary to impose sentences which
will denounce the
offender’s conduct, and deter others who may be tempted to engage in
similar offending.
can be no question that the
threshold is crossed, and that no penalty other
than imprisonment is appropriate in all of the circumstances. Taking into
the maximum penalty of the offence, and the comparative cases which have
been provided by the prosecution and the offender (although
noting that some of
the cases provided by the offender are interstate cases which are of limited
utility in view of the difference
sentencing regimes to which they apply),
together with each of the matters addressed above, I find that the appropriate
to be imposed are:
(a) For count 1, a sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment (discounted from 2
years and 5 months, and rounded down);
(b) For count 2, a sentence of 1 year and 6 months’ imprisonment
(discounted from 1 year and 10 months, and rounded down);
(c) For count 3, a sentence of 1 year and 6 months’ imprisonment
(discounted from 1 year and 10 months, and rounded down);
sentences will involve some accumulation, so as to recognise the separate
criminality involved in the different transactions covered
by the offences. The
sentences for counts 2 and 3 will each add 6 months to the overall
sentence, so that the total sentence will
be 3 years’ imprisonment. The
sentences will be backdated to take account of the time that the offender spent
in custody prior
to the grant of bail.
offender’s counsel urged me to consider the imposition of an alternative
to full time custody, noting that the offender
has been assessed as eligible for
an ICO. As the sentence to be imposed is imprisonment for three years, an ICO
cannot be ordered
unless the court considers it is “appropriate to do
so”, having regard to:
(a) the level of harm to the
victim and the community caused by the offence; and
(b) whether the offender poses a risk to 1 or more people or the
community; and
(c) the offender’s culpability for the offence having regard to
all the circumstances.
Crimes (Sentencing) Act
I accept that the offender does not pose a risk to anyone in the community, the
level of harm to the Centre, its workers and
parents, and the community caused
by the offence is significant, notwithstanding that the funds stolen have now
been repaid. The
offender’s culpability for the offending, whilst reduced
by reason of her mental illness, also remains significant. In these
circumstances, I do not consider that it is appropriate to order that the
sentences be served by way of an ICO.
in view of the offender’s mental illness, the effect of imprisonment on
the offender’s son, and the fact that
the moneys stolen have been
returned, I consider that the purposes of sentence can be met by a partially
suspended sentence, under
which the offender will be released after serving a
short period of imprisonment. The good behaviour order that will be imposed as
condition of the partial suspension will be subject to a community service
condition, under which the offender will be required
to perform 200 hours of
community service.
my view, this sentence will be meet the competing purposes of sentencing in this
case, particularly the need to recognise the harm
caused, to denounce the
offending, to deter others from engaging in similar conduct, and to facilitate
the offender’s rehabilitation.
orders of the Court are:
(1) For Count 1, theft (CAN 343/2025), the offender is convicted and sentenced
to 2 years’ imprisonment, commencing on 17 October
2025 and expiring on
16 October 2027.
(2) For Count 2, theft (CAN 344/2025), the offender is convicted and sentenced
to 1 year and 6 months’ imprisonment, commencing
on 17 October 2026 and
expiring on 16 April 2028.
(3) For Count 3, theft (CAN 345/2025), the offender is convicted and sentenced
to 1 year and 6 months’ imprisonment, commencing
on 17 April 2027 and
expiring on 16 October 2028.
(4) The total sentence will be a period of imprisonment for 3 years, commencing
on 17 October 2025 and expiring on 16 October 2028.
(5) The sentence is to be suspended after a period of 3 months’
imprisonment on 16 January 2026, upon the offender entering
into a Good
Behaviour Order for the remainder of the sentence with the following conditions:
(a) the core conditions;
(b) a community service work condition that the offender perform 200 hours of
community service work within the term of the sentence.
I certify that the preceding eighty-one [81] numbered paragraphs are a
true copy of the Reasons for Sentence of her Honour Justice
