The objective of the
Tribunal exercising its review jurisdiction is to produce the “correct or
preferable” decision.
doing so it is not the role of the Tribunal on review to determinatively
identify error or to vary or substitute a decision only
where there is error.
The Committee’s reasons, or any grounds for review set out in the
initiating application, do not limit
the Tribunal in conducting its
Taddei completed a two year Master of Science (Orthodontics) qualification from
the Eastman Institute in the United Kingdom in
2001, rather than the three year
course which (together with an external bi-collegiate examination) was a
prerequisite for specialist
registration as an orthodontist in the United
Kingdom and Australia.
Thereafter,
from 1 November 2001, Dr Taddei worked in an orthodontic practice in England for
over 20 years until 2022 (when he relocated
to Darwin), including as a
specialist orthodontist under United Kingdom law from 24 January 2020.
Taddei was granted specialist registration in the United Kingdom under a
regulatory pathway whereby his knowledge, skills and experience
in orthodontics
could be considered to augment deficiencies in his two year 2001
qualification.
that respect the Appeal Panel of the General Dental Council (UK) was satisfied
that Dr Taddei’s “knowledge of and experience
in orthodontics
[from almost 20 years of orthodontic practice] is equivalent to the knowledge
and experience which he might reasonably
be expected to have acquired if he had
undertaken the training required for the award of a CCST [ie a Certificate of
Completion of
Training]”.
reference to the pathway for specialist registration in s 58(b) of the National
Law, the Committee rejected registration. The Committee
was not satisfied that
Dr Taddei’s two year Master of Science (Orthodontics) qualification from
the Eastman Institute in
2001 was “substantially equivalent, or based
on similar competencies” to a currently “approved
qualification”
under s 58(a) of the National Law – that is, a Doctor
of Clinical Dentistry in Orthodontics from one of five Australian universities,
in each case being a three year
Committee considered, first, that only Dr Taddei’s 2001 Master of Science
(Orthodontics) was a “qualification”
for s 58(b); the Appeal
Panel’s grant of specialist registration on 20 January 2020 in the United
Kingdom was not.
Secondly the
Committee considered that s 58(b) requires only a comparison of orthodontic
qualification(s); deficiencies in a qualification
cannot be augmented by a
practitioner’s knowledge, skills and experience.
the Tribunal’s view, both of the Committee’s conclusions regarding
the construction of s 58(b) were correct.
that construction of s 58(b), the Committee concluded that Dr Taddei’s two
year Master of Science (Orthodontics) qualification
in 2001 was not
“substantially equivalent, or based on similar competencies, to a three
year “approved qualification”.
Tribunal agrees with this conclusion, in substance for the same reasons as given
by the Committee. Accordingly specialist registration
cannot be granted to Dr
Taddei pursuant to s 58(b).
Committee also rejected specialist registration by reference to s 57(2), as
construed by the Queensland Court of Appeal in
Chinese Medicine Board of
Australia v Lee
[2014] QCA 149
, and subsequently applied by the
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal in
George v Dental Board of
[2022] QCAT 5.
Court of Appeal explained that in “an appropriate
registration
pursuant to s 52(2) (and thus specialist registration pursuant to s 57(2),
given common statutory language) may be granted
“by” (as in
“per force of”) the imposition of conditions under
doing so the Committee relied on Ahpra advice that specialist registration was
not possible under s 57(2), in substance because
Dr Taddei’s knowledge,
skills and experience from working as an orthodontist for almost 20 years
– including as a specialist
orthodontist from 24 January 2020
under United Kingdom law – could not be considered under that
the Tribunal’s view, this advice was incorrect. It reflects an unjustified
construction of s 57(2) and its ambit which is
unduly narrow and
inflexible, and which is inconsistent with the Queensland Court of
Appeal’s exposition in
including as applied by the Queensland
Tribunal in
. Accordingly the Committee’s application of
to specialist registration for Dr Taddei was in
hearing before the Tribunal occurred on 17 and 18 July 2024, and concerned only
specialist registration pursuant to s 58(b) –
not the alternative s 57(2)
pathway. This was because Dr Taddei and his legal representatives were not then
apprised of the s 57(2)
pathway (as construed in
). They first became
aware of the s 57(2) pathway and the Queensland Tribunal’s decision
occurred in circumstances where, in the Tribunal’s view, the Ahpra
correspondence to Dr Taddei dated 22 November 2021 and
16 June 2022
was inadequate to respectively convey the Committee’s
“reasons” for proposing to reject, and for rejecting,
registration under the s 57(2) pathway.
reference to the judicial exposition in
as applied in
Dr Taddei’s circumstances squarely raised the possible application of the
s 57(2) pathway. It was thus incumbent on Ahpra
to succinctly explain the basis
whereby the Committee did not accept that that provision (as explained in those
authorities) applied
to Dr Taddei’s circumstances. That did not
2 August 2024 the Tribunal ordered that the parties provide written submissions
57(2) pathway, which were
received by 18 September 2024. It was not necessary, and was not suggested
by any party, that a further
oral hearing was required.
Tribunal considers, on review, that the evidence comprehensively demonstrates
that Dr Taddei should be registered as a specialist
orthodontist via the s 57(2)
pathway, specifically by the imposition of conditions under s 83 or the
acceptance of an undertaking
under s 83A.
Tribunal accepts, adapting the language of the Appeal Panel of the General
Dental Council (UK) in 2020, that (together with his
2001 qualification)
Dr Taddei’s “knowledge of and experience in orthodontics is
equivalent to the knowledge and experience
which he might reasonably be expected
to have acquired if he had undertaken the training required” for a current
“approved qualification”.
forming that conclusion the Tribunal is satisfied that a grant of specialist
registration to Dr Taddei pursuant to s 57(2) would
fulfil the objects and
guiding principles of the National Law, including that the “protection of
the public” is of “paramount”
importance.
Consequently
the Tribunal considers that the correct, or preferable, decision is that
specialist registration be granted to Dr Taddei
registration respectively occurred by imposition of
conditions pursuant to s 52(2) and 57(2). Subsequently, in 2022, both provisions
were amended to additionally provide that an applicant may be “eligible
for registration” by the acceptance of an undertaking
under s 83A (which
was inserted in 2022).
the Tribunal’s view, applying the Queensland Court of Appeal’s
construction in
, the 2022 amendment means that pursuant to s
57(2) specialist registration may also occur by acceptance of an undertaking
Taddei under s 83A.
Taddei’s written submission identified three possible conditions to
facilitate registration pursuant to s 57(2) (as well
as mentioning the
possibility of an accepted undertaking under s 83A), any of which were said to
be sufficient for that purpose –
whilst appreciating that ultimately this
is a matter for the Tribunal.
Board’s written submissions did not address whether one or more of the
conditions proposed by Dr Taddei would be appropriate
to facilitate specialist
registration, or whether other conditions or an accepted undertaking would more
appropriately achieve that
is because, throughout its consideration of Dr Taddei’s application and
including before the Tribunal, the Board has taken
successive legal positions
which deny that there is power under s 57(2) to facilitate specialist
registration.
detailed herein, the Tribunal does not accept those legal positions, and thus
considers that there is ample power under s 57(2)
(as construed in
and applied in
) to grant specialist registration to Dr
Tribunal would be greatly assisted by the Board’s advice, as supported and
advised by Aphra, regarding appropriate imposed
conditions or an accepted
undertaking to facilitate specialist registration pursuant to s 57(2).
advice should be formulated in accordance with the Tribunal’s position
explained herein as to the construction of s 57(2),
and the appropriate exercise
of that power in relation to specialist registration.
Tribunal orders below that the requested advice be provided by the Board within
14 days of this decision, followed by a response
from Dr Taddei within
seven days of receipt of the Board’s advice.
are fairly short timelines, and the parties have liberty to apply to extend or
vary them should the dates be unsuitable or inconvenient.
orders also provide for submissions by the parties in relation to the question
Taddei obtained a Bachelor of Dental Surgery from the University of Leeds in the
United Kingdom in 1996 (having studied there from
1991). On 5 July 1996 Dr
Taddei was registered to practice as a dentist in the United Kingdom.
Taddei then worked as a general dental practitioner from October 1996 to
September 1999 in Kalgoorlie (Western Australia), London
(United Kingdom),
and Malaysia.
1 November 2001 Dr Taddei was conferred a Master of Science in Orthodontics by
the University College London, after completing
two years of studies at the
Eastman Dental Institute which is part of that College. Dr Taddei commenced this
postgraduate course in the latter part of 1999 (after September of that
two year Master of Science (Orthodontics) qualification did not of itself
entitle Dr Taddei to specialist registration as an
orthodontist in the
United Kingdom. To facilitate that outcome, by a qualification pathway, it was
necessary that Dr Taddei instead
complete a three year Master of Science
(Orthodontics) qualification – which was also offered by the Eastman
Dental Institute,
and thereafter pass a bi-collegiate Membership in Orthodontics
) examination conducted by the Royal College of Surgeons of England
(Faculty of Dental Surgery) and the Royal College of Physicians
and Surgeons of
Glasgow (Dental Faculty). Completion of a three year Master of Science
(Orthodontics) was a prerequisite to sitting
the MOrth examination; a two year
qualification was insufficient.
Taddei opted for the two year Master of Science (Orthodontics) qualification,
rather than a three year course, since he then planned
to work in Malaysia where
a two year qualification either satisfied specialist requirements (noting that
it was accepted by the World
Federation of Orthodontists) or at least was
sufficient for his anticipated orthodontics
Dr Taddei understood that it was not possible, during or at the end of the two
year Master of Science qualification, to convert to
the three year course.
on 1 November 2001, having changed his mind about working in Malaysia,
Dr Taddei commenced employment as an “associate”
Orthodontic Centre in Reading, a town in the County of Berkshire to the west of
London in England – and worked in
this orthodontic practice for the next
20 years until 2022 (including as a specialist orthodontist under United Kingdom
24 January 2020), providing “NHS and self-funded treatment for
children and adults”.
Taddei said that the Centre was a “specialist practice working in
orthodontics 100 percent”, without any “general
dentistry” work at all.
Most, if not all, of the other practitioners working in the Centre were
specialist orthodontists during his
employment.
However, as in
Australia, Dr Taddei’s general dentistry qualification (from the
University of Leeds in 1996) meant that he
could work in any area of dentistry
including orthodontics without being a registered specialist, but provided that
he did not represent
that he was a specialist orthodontist.
Taddei said that he worked at the Centre solely “in the capacity of a
specialist orthodontist” for over 20 years (being
registered in that
specialty from 24 January
collaboratively with his specialist colleagues – which included
“case based discussions” with his practice
principals.
One of those
practice principals was an “orthodontic specialty trainee
supervisor” for many years, and the principals
continued “to
entrust me with the care of the practice’s
and also other
roles including “safeguarding” and assisting with “dental
therapy training and specialist
Taddei said demonstrated confidence in his orthodontic work. Consistent with
that confidence, Dr Taddei said other
specialists at the Centre often requested
his assistance, and that former patients recommended him to other persons

since his initial
registration as a dentist on 5 July 1996, and specialist orthodontist from
24 January 2020, “no suspensions

Taddei said that much of the specialist orthodontic work at the Centre was
publicly funded through the National Health Service

“only complex cases could be treated under
noting that it
was “overstretched”.
Dr Taddei emphasised that the NHS is “highly regulated” –
particularly as compared to Australia – whereby
a practitioner must
provide an initial orthodontic treatment plan including a score as to complexity
followed by a statement of completion
within a timeframe, together with random
audits by the NHS and structured peer assessment (see below) which were directed
at maintaining
Taddei accepted that these audits were not equivalent to “someone standing
over my shoulder [and] telling me what to do”

students in an educational institution (a point emphasised by the Board), but
relied on his over 20 years
of successful orthodontic treatment under this
regulatory framework as demonstrating that he possessed the experience and skill

Dr Taddei produced
written references from his specialist colleagues which support this
assessment.
30 April 2014, whilst working at The Orthodontic Centre in Reading, Dr Taddei
was registered as a general dental practitioner in
Australia under s 222 of the
National Law.
20 July 2018 Dr Taddei applied to the General Dental Council of the United
Kingdom for entry in its specialist list for orthodontics,
that is for
registration as a specialist orthodontist. Dr Taddei did so because of changed
requirements, with future effect from
around 2020, whereby NHS orthodontic
treatment could thereafter only be performed by a registered orthodontist. If
not on the specialist
list Dr Taddei would only be able to “treat simple
cases” or “treat patients privately” outside of the
regulatory pathway under which registration was sought applied to Dr Taddei
because, due to having Italian nationality, he was
person”. That pathway required that Dr Taddei demonstrate “knowledge
of, and experience in, orthodontics
... derived from academic or research work
... equivalent to the knowledge and experience which he might reasonably be
expected to
have acquired if he had undertaken the training required for the
award of a CCST [ie a Certificate of Completion of Specialist
Training]”.
In addition
the General Dental Council was required to consider all of
Dr Taddei’s “dental qualifications, knowledge
or experience,
wherever acquired which are
6 June 2019, after an adverse assessment by a panel and a consequent adverse
recommendation by the Faculty of Dental Surgery of
the Royal College of Surgeons
of England, the General Dental Council rejected Dr Taddei’s application
for specialist registration.
The General Dental Council’s reasons for
rejection, as per the panel’s adverse assessment, included that Dr Taddei
completed only a two year Master of Science (Orthodontics) at the Eastman
Dental Institute in 2001 – rather than a three year
course, and had not
completed the MOrth examination (for which he was ineligible since a three year
course was a prerequisite). The
General Dental Council accepted that the two
year course contained “equivalent theoretical content” to the longer
but said that the third year “provided supervised clinical
experience”.
Taddei’s clinical “knowledge and experience” from (at that
time) almost 20 years of treating patients at The
Orthodontic Centre in Reading
was otherwise considered insufficient to be “equivalent” to a
Certificate of Completion
of Specialist Training for a specialist orthodontist
in the United Kingdom. The adverse assessment found that Dr Taddei’s
“caseload/case-mix”
during his Master of Science course could not be
reliably evaluated due to lack of evidence, in which respect clinical logbooks
course information was unavailable given the passage of time. Also, the
nature of a “research project” conducted by Dr
Taddei was said by
the adverse assessment to be “unclear”, and of no
3 July 2019 Dr Taddei lodged an appeal against the General Dental
Council’s adverse decision, and responded to its reasoning
(as stated in
the panel assessment) by providing additional documentation and an oral
presentation at a hearing.
7 January 2020 an Appeal Panel of the General Dental Council upheld Dr
Taddei’s appeal, and directed that his name be entered
into the specialist
list in orthodontics for the United Kingdom. A certificate of specialist
registration was issued on
Appeal Panel accepted that whilst “there was limited evidence of research
and academia” (as per the regulatory language
quoted above), there was
“considerable evidence” of Dr Taddei’s “knowledge and
experience of orthodontics
gained during his 18 years at the same specialist
practice where the other practitioners are all specialists”, with
“supportive
references” from colleagues including “two
practice principals” with whom he worked during that
The Appeal Panel
accepted that since regulatory change for the NHS in 2005 Dr Taddei had handled
only “complex cases”
at The Orthodontic Centre with “350 case
starts annually”. The Centre had “maintained Band A outcomes at over
since 2005 (being a high standard), and Dr Taddei’s
“personal outcomes are at that

) for Dr Taddei and his
specialist colleagues at the Centre was in evidence for the four year period
from 2015/16 to 2018/19, in each
case in relation to 20 patients. A conclusory
column entitled “% change in PAR score” recorded respective annual
outcomes for Dr Taddei as 82.98, 82.335, 87.035 and 86.99853659 (ie
“over 80%”). These scores were comparable with Dr
specialist colleagues, who with one exception also had similar scores over 80
during that four year period (the exception
being a colleague with a score of
78.985 for the 2016/17
Appeal Panel accepted that a selection of case studies provided by Dr Taddei had
been verified by an NHS assessor as part of random
audit outcomes, with a Dental
Reference Service Orthodontic Report commenting that Dr Taddei’s
“records were well presented
and the patients have all been treated to a
high standard”.
Panel accepted that Dr Taddei had engaged in continuing professional development
“specific to orthodontics and changes
in practice”, and had
“researched, designed and patented an orthodontic bracket”. The
Appeal Panel considered that
Dr Taddei was a “credible witness” who
“showed great attention to detail in his [oral]
presentation”.
conclusion, on the evidence as a whole, the Appeal Panel was satisfied that
Dr Taddei’s “knowledge of and experience
in orthodontics is
equivalent to the knowledge and experience which he might reasonably be expected
to have acquired if he had undertaken
the training required for the award of a
CCST [ie a Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training]”. This

5 May 2021 Dr Taddei applied to the Board for specialist registration in
orthodontics in Australia.

In that respect the statutory

Under that agreement
Ahpra provides the Board with administrative services, policy development

(including “nationally
consistent legal advice and management to support

processes”).
3 and 3A of the National Law respectively set out its, object, objectives and
guiding principles. The “object”
of the National Law is “to
establish a national registration and accreditation scheme” for the
“regulation of health
practitioners”, and “registration of
students” undertaking “programs of study that provide a
qualification
for registration in a health profession” or “clinical
training in a health profession” (s 3(1)).
to s 3(2) the “objectives of the national registration and accreditation
scheme” include:
(a) to provide for the protection of the public by ensuring that only health
practitioners who are suitably trained and qualified
to practise in a competent
and ethical manner are registered; and
(b) to facilitate workforce mobility across Australia by reducing the
administrative burden for health practitioners wishing to move
participating jurisdictions or to practise in more than one participating
(d) to facilitate the rigorous and responsive assessment of overseas-trained
health practitioners; and
(e) to facilitate access to services provided by health practitioners in
accordance with the public interest; and
(f) to enable the continuous development of a flexible, responsive and
sustainable Australian health workforce and to enable innovation
education of, and service delivery by, health practitioners.
3A relevantly provides the following guiding principles:
(1) The main guiding principle of the national registration and accreditation
scheme is that the following are paramount—
(a) protection of the public;
(b) public confidence in the safety of services provided by registered health
practitioners and students.
(2) The other guiding principles of the national registration and accreditation
scheme are as follows—
(a) the scheme is to operate in a transparent, accountable, efficient,
effective and fair way;

7 of the National Law is entitled “Registration of health
practitioners”. It comprises 12 Divisions (ss 52 to
including “General
registration” (Division 1, ss 52 to 56), “Specialist
registration” (Division 2, ss 57
to 61), “Provisional
registration” (Division 3, ss 62 to 64), “Limited
registration” (Division 4, ss 65 to
72), and “Endorsement of
registration” (Division 8, ss 94 to 106).
provisions in Divisions 1 and 2 use common statutory language in relation to
general and specialist registration (ss 52 to 53
and ss 57 to 58), with words
and expressions of that common language thus having the same meaning including
as construed by Courts
in judgments (unless the context demonstrates
otherwise).
pathways and criteria for specialist registration are identified in ss 57 and 58
of the National Law (with common statutory language
in ss 52 and 53 for general
registration), as follows:
57 Eligibility for specialist
registration
(1) An individual is eligible for specialist registration in a recognised
specialty in a health profession if—
(a) the individual is qualified for registration in the specialty; and
(b) the individual has successfully completed—
(i) any period of supervised practice in the specialty required by an approved
registration standard for the health profession; or
(ii) any examination or assessment required by an approved registration standard
for the health profession to assess the individual’s
competently and safely practise the specialty; and
(c) the individual is a suitable person to hold registration in the health
profession; and
(d) the individual is not disqualified under this Law or a law of a
co-regulatory jurisdiction from applying for registration, or
being registered,
in the specialty; and
(e) the individual meets any other requirements for registration stated in
approved registration standard for the specialty.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), the National Board may decide the
individual is eligible for registration in the recognised specialty
either or both of the following—
(a) imposing conditions on the registration under section 83;
(b) accepting an undertaking from the individual under section 83A.
58 Qualifications for specialist registration
An individual is qualified for specialist registration in a recognised
specialty in a health profession if the individual—
(a) holds an approved qualification for the specialty; or
(b) holds another qualification the National Board established for the health
profession considers to be substantially equivalent,
or based on similar
competencies, to an approved qualification for the specialty; or
(c) holds a qualification, not referred to in paragraph (a) or (b), relevant to
the specialty and has successfully completed an examination
or other assessment
required by the National Board for the purpose of registration in the specialty;
(d) the individual—
(i) holds a qualification, not referred to in paragraph (a) or (b), that under
this Law or a corresponding prior Act qualified the
individual for specialist
registration (however described) in the specialty; and
(ii) was previously registered under this Law or the corresponding prior Act on
the basis of holding that qualification for the specialty.
but not all, of the statutory language used for specialist registration in ss 57
to 58 (and general registration in ss 52 to
53) is also used in Division 3
(Provisional registration), Division 4 (Limited registration) and Division 8
(Endorsement of registration)
of Part 7. Several authorities concern that
language in those
provisions.
language of s 57(2) (and s 52(2)) about eligibility for registration
“by” imposing conditions or accepting an undertaking
is replicated
for Divisions 3 and 4 (ss 62(2) and 65(2)), but the two limbs of s 58(b) (and s
53(b) viz “substantially equivalent,
or based on similar
competencies” to an “approved qualification”) is not.
8 of Part 7 is entitled “Endorsement of registration” (ie for
medicines, nurse practitioners, acupuncture, and approved areas of
practice), which requires an “approved qualification”,
“another qualification” that is “substantially equivalent, or
based on similar competencies” (ie the same
statutory language as for ss
58(b) (and s 53(b)). However Division 8 does not include provisions
equivalent to ss 57(2) (and s 52(2))
registration “by” imposing conditions or accepting an
undertaking.
82 of the National Law is entitled “Decision about application”, and
identifies the decisions which the Board
may make about an application for
general or specialist registration, including Dr Taddei’s application.

granted where an applicant is “eligible” by
reference to the statutory criteria in a “relevant section”

“qualified” for registration (s 82(1)(c)(i)(A)).
statutory process has two steps. Where the Board after initial consideration
proposes to reject registration (or impose conditions),
it must give written
notice and “reasons” to the applicant and invite a written or verbal
submission about the proposal
(s 81). If the Board after considering any
submission decides to reject registration, it must give written notice to the
which states the “reasons for the decision”
(s 84(2)(a)).
83 of the National Law provides:
83 Conditions of
registration
(1) If a National Board decides to register a person in a health profession
for which the Board is established, the registration is
subject to any condition
the Board considers necessary or desirable in the circumstances.
A failure by a registered health practitioner to comply with a condition of
the practitioner’s registration does not constitute
an offence but may
constitute behaviour for which health, conduct or performance action may be

condition referred to in subsection (1), the Board must decide

registration
If a National Board decides to register a person in a health profession for
which the Board is established, the Board may accept any
undertaking from the
person the Board considers necessary or desirable in the circumstances.
83A was inserted by amendment in 2022, together with a related amendment to s

Taddei’s application for review must be determined by reference to the

principally occur where an individual is “qualified”
possessing an “approved qualification” (ie for an orthodontist a
three year Doctor of Clinical Dentistry in Orthodontics
from one of five
Australian universities) (ss 53(a) and 58(a)), or alternatively
“another qualification” (eg from overseas)
which is considered to be
“substantially equivalent, or based on similar competencies, to an
approved qualification”
(ss 53(b) and 58(b)).
far as the Tribunal is aware, and as the Board confirmed, there are no
authorities which concisely discuss whether this expression
in s 58(b) (and s
53(b)) disjunctively identifies two separate limbs (or tests), albeit
overlapping, whereby an overseas practitioner’s
qualification is compared
to an “approved qualification”. The first limb is the expression
“substantially equivalent”;
the second limb is the expression
“based on similar competencies”. Published authorities principally
focus on the first
limb. An alternative construction is that the two limbs are a
“compound phrase”, rather than an expression containing
two separate
the Tribunal’s view the use of the conjunction “or” and
associated punctuation (ie the placement of two commas)
in this expression means
that s 58(b) (and s 53(b) for general registration) disjunctively
identifies two separate limbs (or tests),
albeit overlapping, whereby an
overseas practitioner’s qualification is compared to an “approved
qualification”.
cases the second limb conceivably may have separate work to do where the medical
qualification some decades ago of an experienced
overseas practitioner is
arguably no longer “substantially equivalent” to a current
“approved qualification”
from an Australian university, given new
medical treatments and knowledge which did not exist when the practitioner
completed his
or her studies. The practitioner’s qualification some
decades ago ordinarily would still be “based on similar
competencies”
to a current “approved qualification”, meaning
that the second limb of s 58(b) (or s 53(b) for general registration)
be satisfied. At least, the inclusion of the second limb removes any doubt that
might arise in this
circumstance.
to s 83, the registration (including specialist registration) of a practitioner
may be subject to “any condition the
Board considers necessary or
desirable in the circumstances”. For example supervisory or updated
treatment/training conditions
may be imposed where a practitioner returns from
an extended period of non-practice, or to restrict a practitioner’s scope
of practice in Australia if his or her overseas practice was restricted (eg due
to the scope of practice being narrower under the
overseas legislative scheme,
or because there were conditions on a practitioner’s overseas
registration).
policy guide and authorities
Taddei’s application was considered by reference to an internal policy
guide entitled “Overseas-trained dental specialist
registration
assessments” (version 1.6, effective from 1 July 2016 as updated on 18
July 2017), which was prepared by Ahpra
and used to assess applications (the
Policy Guide
was to “guide decision making” by providing “policy advice to
Ahpra, the Board, and its committees on
what to consider when managing and
deciding applications for dental specialist registration from overseas-trained
dental specialists”.
The Policy Guide said that “relevant
information” therein would “also be published on the Board’s
Policy Guide expressly referred to the judgment of Kyrou JA of the Supreme Court
of Victoria in
Pereira v of the Psychology Board of Australia
as establishing (in Ahpra’s words) the following meaning for the term

registration (and its
counterpart for general registration s
Qualification
does not include practical experience, unless this practical experience is
formally assessed for the purpose of formal
educational qualifications and
potentially membership of recognised professional bodies.
Qualification, for the purpose of assessment under section 58 of the National
Law for dental specialist registration, may include:
educational qualifications such as obtained from a university, and
membership of
recognised professional bodies, such as a specialist academy or college when
such recognition is obtained after a formal
assessment.
concerned a psychologist’s application for endorsement in clinical
psychology under s 98(1)(a)(ii) of the National Law (Division
8, Subdivision 5)
on the basis (inter alia) that her Master of Psychology (Counselling Psychology)
from La Trobe University was “substantially
equivalent to, or based on
similar competencies to, an approved qualification”. An endorsement meant
that the psychologist
could provide certain service items for Medicare, and hold
herself out as a clinical psychologist.
Psychology Board of Australia rejected the application, as did the Victorian
Civil and Administrative Tribunal on review, but
in doing so did not extend time
so that the psychologist could be considered for registration under transitional
provisions. The
Supreme Court of Victoria (Kyrou JA) upheld an appeal on the
basis that time should be extended, and also made observations about
the meaning
of the term “qualification” in
s 98(1)(a)(ii).
[30] Kyrou JA identified the following possible meanings for the undefined term
“qualification” in s 98(1)(a)(ii):
Depending on the
context, the word ‘qualification’ is capable of at least three
meanings. The first meaning encompasses
only a formal educational qualification.
The second meaning encompasses a formal educational qualification or membership
of a recognised
professional body. The third meaning encompasses a formal
educational qualification, membership of a recognised professional body
practical skill and experience which is unconnected to such a qualification or
membership.
[35] his Honour explained a standard principle of construction that
“[g]enerally, in the absence of indications to the contrary,
where a word
appears in an Act more than once – especially in the same section –
it should be given a consistent interpretation”,
“inconsistency does not necessarily arise” if a word in a defined
“composite term” is interpreted
in accordance with its definition
whilst “the word appearing on its own is interpreted in accordance with
its natural meaning”.
[38] to [39] Kyrou JA concluded in favour of the second meaning for the term
“qualification” in s 98(1)(a)(ii) of the
National Law, that is
“a course of study or membership based on formal assessment by a
recognised educational or
professional body, rather than competencies gained
merely from stand-alone practical experience”. The latter could only be
pursuant to that provision where it had been assessed as part of a
“formal educational qualification or membership of a recognised
professional body”, where that assessment was “based on objective
standards”.
Subsequently,
Arakkal v Medical Board of Australia
[2017] WASCA 219
[109], the Western Australian Court of Appeal explained that the term
“qualification” as used in the “statutory
context” of s
58(d) (a grandparenting provision) is not “limited only to qualifications
obtained after a course of study”.
That paragraph concerns an individual
who “holds a qualification ... that under ... a corresponding prior Act
qualified the
individual for specialist registration (however described) in the
specialty”, in circumstances where some prior legislation
for registration
in Australian jurisdictions “identified qualifications in terms that did
not refer to the person having undertaken
a course of study”. In relation
to the medical profession the Court cited such prior legislation in Western
Australia, NSW,
Queensland and Victoria. This was also the case in the Northern
Territory, including for a dental
specialist.
Western Australian Court of Appeal observed that these “practical
consequences” did not appear to have been raised
before Kyrou JA, and
identified another “arguable construction” for the term
“qualification” as used as part
of a phrase in s 58(d) (which
incorporated the use of that term in prior legislation), but did not find it
necessary “in a
comprehensive way” to resolve the construction of
that phrase.
Tribunal accepts the meaning explained by Kyrou JA in
term “qualification” as used in s 58(b), namely – as the Board
submitted – that a “qualification”
must be “some form of
certificate or other credential attained through a direct assessment of
“actual skill or competency”
by an “examining body” (ie
a recognised educational or professional body performing that role), as distinct
consideration of “information” or “documents”
provided by an applicant for registration”– as
occurred before the
Appeal Panel of the General Dental Council when granting specialist registration
on 7 January 2020 in the United
Western Australian Court of Appeal’s exposition of the term
“qualification” in
may be distinguished from
, since it concerns the use of that term in a different statutory
context being the grandparenting provision in s 58(d). That provision
apply to Dr Taddei’s application.
means for s 58(b) that the only “qualification” possessed by
Dr Taddei is his two year Master of Science (Orthodontics)
from the Eastman
Institute in 2001. Dr Taddei’s specialist registration as an
orthodontist on 24 January 2020 in the United
Kingdom is not a
“qualification”, because the Appeal Panel of the General Dental
Council was not an “examining
body” which itself conducted a formal
assessment when granting registration (as does an educational institution when
a qualification). Likewise Dr Taddei’s membership of the
Orthodontic Specialists Group of the British Orthodontic Society,
and fellowship
of the World Federation of Orthodontics, are not a “qualification”
for s 58(b).
Policy Guide observed that overseas qualified practitioners seeking specialist
registration ordinarily do not hold an (Australian)
qualification” under s 58(a) of the National Law – that is, a Doctor
of Clinical Dentistry in Orthodontics
from one of five Australian universities,
in each case being a three year
This is the pathway
ordinarily used by students who reside, and study, in Australia. As an overseas
practitioner Dr Taddei does not
hold such an “approved
qualification”, meaning that the pathway in s 58(a) does not apply.
pathway for specialist registration is s 58(c), whereby an overseas-qualified
practitioner who does not satisfy any of the
alternative pathways in s 58(a),
(b) or (d) may complete “an examination or other assessment”
required by the Board for
registration in a specialty. There are 12 dental
specialties, however the Board has not approved an examination or other
for the specialty of
orthodontics.
Consequently, for
Dr Taddei, the pathway in s 58(c) does not apply.
pathway for specialist registration in s 58(d) also does not apply to Dr Taddei.
In substance it is a grandparenting provision
which concerns dental
practitioners who were previously registered under the National Law or earlier
corresponding legislation, on
the basis of a qualification other than an
“approved qualification” under s 58(a) or a qualification recognised
Accordingly,
insofar as the pathways identified in the four paragraphs of s 58 are concerned,
the Policy Guide for overseas practitioners
principally focuses upon s 58(b). It
provides that an overseas practitioner is “qualified for specialist
registration in a
recognised specialty” if he or she holds a qualification
which is “substantially equivalent, or based on similar
competencies”
to a currently “approved qualification” (ie a
Doctor of Clinical Dentistry in Orthodontics from one of five Australian
universities, in each case being a three year course).
Policy Guide identified six “qualification equivalence criteria” by
which the criteria in s 58(b) are assessed by
an appointed
“equivalence assessment panel” for the assistance of the Board or a
committee when determining a registration
application. Criterion 2 requires that
an overseas practitioner’s “qualification is 3-4 equivalent
full-time years”
in duration as is the case for an “approved
qualification” (ie a Doctor of Clinical Dentistry in Orthodontics from one
of five Australian universities, in each case being a three year

through supervised practice and/or further training”, in which

for consideration by the relevant committee of
the Board” as to whether or
not any “deficits” in a practitioner’s qualification (as
identified by the qualification

training” (pursuant
to conditions), and if so the “nature” of
such supervision and/or education and training. Where deficiencies could not

a deficiency in an applicant’s qualification
and fulfil registration,
derives from the judgment of the Queensland Court of Appeal in
Medicine Board of Australia v Lee
[2014] QCA 149
(as discussed
below), albeit that the Policy Guide does not identify that authority or explain
the practical operation of the
omission of the Policy Guide to explain the legal basis and practical operation
of this pathway is a significant deficiency, which
apparently informed errors in
documentation prepared for the Committee’s consideration of
Dr Taddei’s application.
the Queensland Court of Appeal held that, pursuant to s 52(2),
general registration as an acupuncturist could occur “by”
“per force of”) the imposition of conditions under s 83,
notwithstanding that the practitioner’s “qualification”
not “substantially equivalent, or based on similar competencies, to an
approved qualification” (s
The Court said that, by
this means under s 52(2), “compliance with
s 52(1) can be
achieved” – particularly that the acupuncturist was
“qualified” for
general registration as required by s 52(1)(a)
– since “eligibility can be achieved per force of the imposition of
conditions”
that respect, at first instance and pursuant to s 52(2), the Queensland
Civil and Administrative Tribunal applied the same construction
provision, and imposed conditions on the annual registration which required a
“newly qualified” practitioner
to be supervised pursuant to an
agreed plan, with quarterly reports and a final report on application for
renewal of registration.
Here it was the supervised practice imposed by the
conditions which rectified “deficiencies” in the
practitioner’s
“course and qualification”, since he had only
limited practical experience which did not rectify those
deficiencies.
plainly enough, a practitioner’s knowledge, skills and experience is
relevant to identifying an appropriate condition
to be imposed when utilising
the ss 52(2) (or 57(2)) pathway for registration. In that respect there was
some variation in the conditions

reading of the Policy
Guide may suggest otherwise, it is the Tribunal’s view that this is

(2011) 2 Qd R 200.
This was an earlier judgment of the Queensland Court of Appeal (differently
constituted) in relation to a similarly worded provision
in the prior Queensland
legislation for the registration of medical practitioners. The Court refrained
from expressing a view about
the construction of that provision, particularly
since it was not the subject of considered submissions;

New South Wales and Victoria:

Krause v Medical Board of Australia
[2013] VCAT 1009.
Tribunals considered that the opening words in s 52(2) (which are common to s
57(2)), viz “Without limiting subsection

health practitioner could not be registered “by” (as in “per
force of”) the

registration.
In that respect on 3 February 2022 the Court of
Appeal’s reasoning was applied to the latter provisions by the Queensland
and Administrative Tribunal in
George v Dental Board of
[2022] QCAT 5.
Pursuant to s 57(2), a dental
practitioner whose overseas qualification did not satisfy the criteria in s
58(b) was instead registered
by the Queensland Tribunal as a specialist
endodontist “by” (as in “per force of”) the imposition
of conditions
under s 83.
In doing so the Queensland Tribunal reversed the Dental Board’s refusal in
2019 to register the practitioner in the dental
specialty of endodontics.
practitioner, Dr George, was registered as a general dental practitioner in
India in 1995 (having completed a Bachelor of Dental
Science from the University
of Mysore in 1994), and after completing a Master of Dental Science from the
Rajiv Gandhi Health University
in 1999 was registered as a specialist
endodontist in India in that year. Thereafter Dr George practised as an
endodontist in India
and Kuwait until August 2001 when he took up an academic
position in India. In 2006 Dr George commenced research for a doctorate
University of Queensland Dental School (which he completed in 2009), and has
worked as a lecturer at the Griffith University
(and the University of
Queensland) since 2008 – in due course as a Professor in its Dental
School. Dr George lectured in endodontics
at both undergraduate and postgraduate
level, and since November 2008 was the “discipline lead in Endodontics at
the Griffith
University Dental School”. In 2019 the Dental College of
Australia approved a three year course of study for the degree of
Dental Studies at Griffith University as an “approved qualification”
for registration as a specialist in endodontics,
and Dr George was closely
involved in setting up that course and was the Director of Studies for it. Dr
George had also practised
dentistry for the last 10 years in a separate private
practice, mostly in the field of
endodontics.
evidence squarely raised the possible application of the s 57(2) pathway (as
construed in
), however the Dental Board rejected specialist
registration on 9 March 2019 on the basis that Dr George’s
overseas qualification
did not satisfy the criteria in s 58(b). The Queensland
Tribunal’s summary of the Dental Board’s assessment of Dr
application suggests that, as is also the case for Dr Taddei, the
Dental Board’s consideration of the s 57(2) pathway to facilitate
specialist registration (to the extent that it occurred) was
inadequate.

57(2), by imposing a condition that Dr George “remain

until the first student or students graduate with that degree on completion of
that course”
(ie at the end of 2022). The review period for the condition
was 18 months (s
doing so the Queensland Tribunal accepted that Dr George’s knowledge,
skills and experience was relevant to identifying that
condition and
facilitating specialist registration pursuant to s 57(2). The Queensland
Tribunal was satisfied that Dr George was
“thoroughly familiar with the
subject” of endodontics (both from academic work since 2008 and private
practice for the
previous 10 years), and that registration would not be
“in any way contrary to the objective of furthering the health and safety
of the public”.

s 80(1)(b) of the National Law that further information/documentation
required, particularly “specialist program material” and evidence of
“clinical experience”
relating to his 2001 Master of Science
(Orthodontics) qualification. It would be
assessed by reference to
qualification equivalence criteria (with a website link provided), specifically
six criteria which must be
met to establish that a qualification (particularly
from overseas) is “substantially equivalent, or based on similar
competencies”
to a currently “approved qualification” (as per

Taddei’s 2001 Master of Science (Orthodontics) qualification

Equivalence Assessment Panel
7 October 2021 an Equivalence Assessment Panel of the Board met by
videoconference to consider Dr Taddei’s application. The
comprised two specialist orthodontists, and a specialist in oral pathology. Two
Ahpra regulatory staff attended, having prepared
an agenda paper for the
Panel’s consideration. The agenda paper confirmed that Dr Taddei had been
advised that his two-year
Master of Science (Orthodontics) qualification in 2001
was not “substantially equivalent” to a three year “approved
qualification”, as required for the registration pathway in s
opening page of the agenda paper said that the Panel must assess which of three
recommendations (enumerated A, B and C) were the
“most appropriate”,

with s 58(b), and the third being that it did not.

reaching a conclusion on this issue. This
was the case despite the provision of
such advice being contemplated by the Policy Guide.
Specifically,
by reference to the wording of the Policy Guide, there was no advice (with
reasoning): (i) as to the “nature”
of conditions for
“supervised practice and/or further education and training” to
address deficiencies and facilitate
specialist registration;
alternatively (ii) that the deficiencies could not be addressed such that
Dr Taddei’s application should be rejected, and
a recommendation made to
that effect to the Committee.

meeting on 17 November 2021. The six person Committee
comprised three
specialist dentists (in periodontics, oral health therapy, and paediatric
dentistry – but not in orthodontics),
a general dentist, and two community
members. Six Ahpra regulatory staff attended, having prepared an agenda paper
for the Committee’s
consideration.
agenda paper for the meeting was in substantially the same form as that prepared
for the Equivalence Assessment Panel (which was
part of the Committee’s
supplied documentation), but with the option of registration by imposition of
conditions via Recommendation

rejected by the Panel.
agenda paper recommended that, at first instance, the Committee propose to
refuse Dr Taddei’s application for specialist
registration on the same
bases identified by the Panel vis-à-vis non-compliance with s 58(b) (as
summarised above).
first basis was that Dr Taddei’s two year Master of Science (Orthodontics)
qualification (and any other claimed qualification)
did not satisfy s 58

second basis concerned the s 57(2) pathway. The agenda paper recorded that the
Equivalence Assessment Panel’s role included

of the Committee’s
letter dated 22 November 2021 an Ahpra regulatory officer notified Dr Taddei
that the Committee proposed to reject his application
for specialist

the National Law, but in accordance
with the process in s 81(2) invited him to
make a “written or verbal submission”

the circumstances of this matter – which squarely raised the possible
application of the s 57(2) pathway, this bare statement
was inadequate to convey
the Committee’s “reasons” for the proposed rejection of
specialist registration.
bare statement does not advise of the Committee’s position that, pursuant
to the s 57(2) pathway, Dr Taddei’s knowledge,
skills and experience
from working as an orthodontist for almost 20 years (including as a specialist
orthodontist from 24 January
2020 under United Kingdom law) cannot be
considered as part of rectifying deficits in his 2001 qualification –
since a comparable
regulatory pathway to that in the United Kingdom “does
not exist in Australia”.
Consequently
the bare statement does not contain any assessment of whether – adapting
the language of the Appeal Panel of the
General Dental Council in 2020 –
Dr Taddei’s “knowledge of and experience in orthodontics is
equivalent to the
knowledge and experience which he might reasonably be expected
to have acquired if he had undertaken the training required”
so that his
two year 2001 qualification was “substantially equivalent, or based on
similar competencies” to an approved
three year qualification.
Taddei was entitled to know the legal and factual basis which underpinned the
proposed rejection of his application, particularly
so that he could obtain
legal advice to inform his response.
the time Dr Taddei was self-represented, and could hardly be expected to
appreciate from the minimal information provided in the
Ahpra letter that the
s 57(2) pathway existed, or to have any knowledge of the Queensland Court
of Appeal’s judgment and reasoning
Even with legal
representation, unless alerted to that judgment in Board and Ahpra documentation
(noting also that it is not listed
on their websites), the existence of this
pathway is not obvious and is easily missed.
3 February 2022 the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal published its
decision in
George v Dental Board of Australia
[2022] QCAT 5
, which had
been heard one year earlier on 12 February 2021. As explained above the
Queensland Tribunal applied
(as it was bound to do) and, pursuant to
s 57(2), registered a dental practitioner whose overseas qualification did not
satisfy the
criteria in s 58(b) as a specialist endodontist “by” (as
in “per force of”) the imposition of conditions
under s 83. The
practitioner applied for specialist registration on 3 October 2017, which the
Dental Board rejected on 9 March 2019.
letter dated 11 February 2022 to the Board, Dr Taddei provided additional
information and sought the opportunity to make an oral
submission to the
Committee (which subsequently occurred on 18 May 2022). Although not apprised of
the s 57(2) pathway as per the
2014 judgment in
(or the Queensland
Tribunal decision in
eight days earlier), Dr Taddei again
requested that his “training, knowledge and experience” from working
in the capacity
of an orthodontist for almost 20 years – including as a
specialist orthodontist from 24 January 2020 under United Kingdom law
– be taken into account for specialist registration in
request was reiterated in circumstances where Dr Taddei had not been told, as
part of the Committee’s “reasons”,
that on Ahpra advice Dr
Taddei’s knowledge, skills and experience could not be taken into account
to support specialist registration
(as had occurred in 2020 under the United
Kingdom regulatory scheme).
Taddei estimated that by reference to the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need
) which determines the severity of cases eligible for NHS treatment,
he had treated “approximately 5000 cases” whose “aesthetic
index” was “6 and
measure of complexity, with “NHS orthodontic treatment” only
available to individuals individuals with an “IOTN
of DHC 4 or 5; or those
with an IOTN DHC of 3 with at least an aesthetic component of 6” (the
acronym DHC means Dental Health
Component).
Taddei enclosed (inter alia) his “NHS prescribing profile for the period
2002-2005” which demonstrates the number of
orthodontic appliances he
fitted during that
financial year 2002-2003, I had fitted 1129 orthodontic appliances. In the
financial 2003-2004, I had fitted 1546 orthodontic
appliances. In the financial
year 2004-2005, I had fitted 1943 orthodontic appliances. The orthodontic
appliances fitted would include
removable appliances, fixed appliances,
headgear, fixed expanders, functional appliances and retainers.
Taddei emphasised, noting the “longitudinal nature of orthodontic
treatment”, that he had orthodontically “treated
patients in one
location for 20 years where I have assessed, diagnosed, treatment planned,
started and followed through my cases
to completion and seen them long after
their retention phase has been
completed”.
conclusion Dr Taddei submitted that, together with his two year Master of
Science (Orthodontics) from the Eastman Institute in
2001, his extensive
experience in properly treating a high volume of complex orthodontic cases while
working in one orthodontic practice
for over 20 years demonstrated
“fulfilment of the AQF Level 9 Masters Degree descriptors” (ie a
three year Doctor of
Clinical Dentistry in Orthodontics from one of
universities).
Taddei later provided a supportive reference dated 11 May 2022 from Dr Mark
Leedham, orthodontist and forensic odontologist, which
agreed with this
conclusion. Dr Leedham suggested – given Dr Taddei’s extensive
orthodontic experience, and specialist
registration since 24 January 2020 in the
United Kingdom – that any deficiencies particularly as to the benchmarking
two year Master of Science (Orthodontics) qualification in 2001 could be
“remediated by a short period of supervised practice”.
is, Dr Leedham suggested the imposition of an appropriate condition to
facilitate specialist registration for Dr Taddei, which
– although not
identified by Dr Leedham – may occur pursuant to s 57(2) (as construed in
), and which by that time had been applied on 3 February 2022 by
the Queensland Tribunal in
(to which the Dental Board was a
Committee met by videoconference on 18 May 2022 to further consider and decide
Dr Taddei’s application. It comprised four
of the six persons who first

general dentist, and two community
members. Three Ahpra regulatory staff

consideration.

above – particularly the ‘bare
statement’ (at [154] and [162] above) and the extract with the underlined
that the United Kingdom regulatory pathway “does not exist in
Australia” (at [144] and [156]
misleading and incorrect advice was reiterated notwithstanding that, about three
months earlier (on 3 February 2022), the Queensland
Tribunal in
used the s 57(2) pathway to grant specialist registration of an endodontist
“by” (as in “per force of”) conditions.
In doing so the
Queensland Tribunal accepted that Dr George’s knowledge, skills and
experience of endodontics in academic positions
and private practice rectified
deficiencies in his overseas qualification (as compared to an Australian
“approved qualification”).
Queensland Tribunal’s analysis, and application of the s 57(2)
pathway, demonstrated that the agenda paper and related advice
hitherto provided
to the Committee for the meeting on 17 November 2021 was incorrect, and required
review. At least, the Committee
ought to have been formally advised of the
substance and outcome of the decision in
so that – as a
delegate exercising decision-making power – it could form its own view,
and reach its own judgment, about
that pathway.
Institutionally both the
Board, and Ahpra, must be taken as having been apprised of
the Queensland
Tribunal’s analysis and the outcome of its decision (not least since the
Board was a party), but on the documentary
evidence filed that information was
not formally conveyed to the Committee in a revised agenda paper. Nor is there
any written record
that such advice was orally given (see below).

legally incorrect, and

additional reasons confirm the Committee’s position that Dr Taddei’s
knowledge, skills and experience was not relevant
to the qualification pathway
in s 58(b), and also that that evidence could not be considered in relation to
the s 57(2) pathway as
construed by the Queensland Court of Appeal in

the Tribunal’s view this stated conclusion is legally incorrect. The point
of the Queensland Court of Appeal’s statutory

achieved” (ie that an individual is “eligible”
“qualified” for registration), with eligibility instead
“achieved per
force of the imposition of
conditions”.
the s 52(2) pathway does not require that an individual is
“qualified” under one of the paragraphs (a) to (d)
of s 53 for
general registration. Likewise the s 57(2) pathway does not require that a
practitioner is “qualified” under
one of the paragraphs (a) to (d)
of s 58 for specialist registration.

dated 11 December 2023. Dr Mahony completed a two year Master of Science

year Master of Science

years’ experience (principally as a specialist)

privately, Dr Lewis was variously
a lecturer and external examiner in

2008 and 2020 Dr Lewis was an accreditor of orthodontics courses at the
University of Sydney, Queensland and Western Australia
(including under the
auspices of the Australian Society of Orthodontists and the Australian Dental
Council), which involved assessing
the course curricula and clinical load and
work of postgraduates to ensure performance was at a level expected from a
training institution.
Dr Lewis explained that there “tends to be a fairly
level playing field” in the quality and standard of Australasian
orthodontics courses particularly since around 2012 whereby the “heads of
all departments in Australia and New Zealand rotate

Lewis’s accreditation and lecturing

give direct evidence regarding contemporary coursework for orthodontics in
Australian universities.
Taddei gave oral evidence at the hearing. As was the case before the Appeal

possible statutory pathways for specialist registration, as raised by the
evidence, are considered below under the following
subheadings.

Taddei’s 2001 qualification with an Australian “approved

discussed above, the Tribunal accepts the meaning explained by Kyrou JA in
for the term “qualification” as used in s 58(b),
namely – as the Board submitted – that a “qualification”
must be “some form of certificate or other credential attained through a

performing that role), as distinct from the

evidence about contemporary coursework for orthodontics in Australian
universities), that Dr Taddei’s two year 2001 Master of Science
(Orthodontics) qualification does not comply with either limb
Taddei said that, as compared to a current Australian three-year “approved
qualification”, the two year course at the
Eastman Institute in 2001 was
“very unique” and “extremely intensive” because it
“front load[ed] pretty
much all the training within the first two years
– such that it should be taken as being “substantially equivalent,
based on similar competencies” to a three year Doctor of Clinical
Dentistry in Orthodontics from one of five Australian universities
(ie a current
“approved qualification”) which are not comparably
Without detracting
from that comparative conclusion, Dr Taddei naturally accepted in cross
examination that a student would have
greater competence on completion of the
three year course at the Eastman Institute, than would be the case for a student
of the two year course at that
institution.
Mahony agreed with Dr Taddei’s comparative conclusion, particularly that
the two year course at the Eastman Institute was
intensive and a “very
full on programme” – as compared to a current Australian
qualification.
emphasised his assessment that “the two years of orthodontic graduate
training in Eastman [in 2001] is equivalent
to the current expectations of the
Australian Dental Council as the number of hours, excluding holidays, is
equivalent as in the
depth of teaching and the topics covered”. Dr Mahony
considered that “the number of clinical cases to be covered during
two-year programme in Eastman is the same, if not more, than that required in a
three-year programme in
Australia”.
oral evidence Dr Mahony said that Australian universities had a significantly
greater number of holidays during the year than the
Eastman Institute (both in
2001 and currently), meaning that Dr Taddei’s two-year Master of Science
(Orthodontics) qualification
was considerably more intensive and equated to a
current three year Australian “approved qualification”. Dr Mahony

conclusion, a review of the training programmes at Sydney University, University
of Western Australia, and the Eastman Institute
reveals substantial equivalence
in both didactic and clinical preparation for orthodontic specialists. The
curriculums cover the
same core topic areas including orthodontic theory,
biomechanics, diagnosis, treatment planning, and multidisciplinary care. Both
programmes also incorporate cell biology, genetics, psychology, research
methods, oral health, and practice management.
Mahony’s direct experience at the Eastman Institute corroborated Dr
Taddei’s evidence about the comparative intensity
of coursework, in
circumstances where some documentation from 2001 was no longer available given
the passage of time. Similar evidentiary
deficiencies from the passage of time
, however – unlike for Dr Taddei – Dr
George’s direct evidence about the coursework for his 1999 postgraduate
qualification
in endodontics from the Rajiv Gandhi Health University was not
corroborated, and was thus given less weight. Accordingly, on the
“currently available”, the Queensland Tribunal in
“not persuaded” that the criteria in s 58(b) had been
demonstrated (ie that Dr George’s 1999 qualification
“substantially equivalent, or based on similar competencies” to an
Australian “approved
qualification”).
Nonetheless
in the Tribunal’s view it remains the case, particularly given his
extensive accreditation experience, that Dr Lewis
is better placed to give
direct evidence regarding contemporary coursework for orthodontics in Australian
universities – which,
in turn, informs the comparative task. Considering
the evidence as a whole the Tribunal is not satisfied, particularly given
evidence about contemporary coursework for orthodontics,
that the first or second limbs of that provision are made out.
follows from this evidentiary finding that Dr Taddei’s 2001 Master of
Science (Orthodontics) qualification does not satisfy
the criteria in s 58(b).
Specialist registration cannot occur under this provision.
are broader contextual considerations which inform the evaluative task under
s 58(b) which confirm that Dr Taddei’s 2001
qualification does
not satisfy the criteria for that provision.
Lewis did not accept that it was “plausible” that there would be
“no additional clinical or didactics knowledge”
from a three year
postgraduate course (and also from the “rigorous” MOrth
examination), as compared to a two year course,
particularly since
former had a “50% increased length of study” as compared to the
that respect Dr Lewis emphasised historic change in educational standards,
whereby some decades ago postgraduate courses for specialist
orthodontics had
increased to a three year
time of Dr Mahony’s training there was still a pathway in Australia where
twenty-four-month programs were acceptable
and this was then followed by a
twelve-month logbook supervision period where all his decisions and cases were
documented and logged
with an appointed supervisor to bring it up to a
thirty-six-month clinical equivalence. This ceased to be the case in Australia
to Dr Taddei undertaking a program in the United Kingdom as both Australia
and UK had moved to what was then more a globally advocated
three-year program
as being optimal for specialist training.
The movement to the three-year program was to allow the increase of the depth
of learning of the post-graduate students as well as
the ability to treat more
complex clinical cases through to completion. This was simply not practical
within a twenty-four-month
program. It is not simply a case of covering a list
of topics which may be the same for a 2-year or 3-year program but the increased
length of time and depth that the postgraduates are exposed to in each topic in
the third year of study. The University of Sydney
responded [to a recent query
by Dr Lewis] that they struggle to cover all the topics to the depth they
require in the 3 years.
evidence underscores that the evaluative task contemplated by s 58(b) whereby a
qualification (or qualifications) is compared
with a current Australian
“approved qualification” does not occur in a vacuum. There is a
broader context. The comparative
task must take into account that over many
years there has been a substantial and continuing effort by educational
institutions,
health professions, and regulators to ensure common educational
and training standards – particularly to “facilitate
the rigorous
and responsive assessment of overseas-trained health practitioners”, and
“facilitate workforce mobility
across Australia” (including by
overseas practitioners).
Dr Lewis explained this collaborative effort to ensure common standards occurs
both nationally and internationally, plainly with
the “paramount”
object of ensuring the “protection of the public” and promoting
confidence in health professions
treatments.
Consequently
the Board’s position that even a three year Master of Science
(Orthodontics) from the Eastman Institute, whether
in 2001 or currently, does
not of itself meet the requirements of s 58(b) because the MOrth examination
must also be completed is
unsurprising – and must be accepted. That three
year qualification would not result in specialist registration as an
orthodontist
under the qualification pathway in the United Kingdom; nor would a
two year qualification. More is required, particularly completion
of the MOrth
examination. The evaluative task in s 58(b) contemplates that significant weight
will be given to ensuring consistency
in registration outcomes
comparable regulatory regimes.
contextual appreciation lends strongly against the proposition that the two year
(or three year) Master of Science qualification
from the Eastman Institute, of
itself, is sufficient for specialist registration in orthodontics under the s
58(b) qualification
pathway. That outcome would mean that, in 2025, a
practitioner could simply complete the two year (or three year) course at the
Institute, and immediately be registered as a specialist orthodontist in
Australia – notwithstanding that he or she could not
be registered in the
United Kingdom because the MOrth examination had not been undertaken. Indeed
this would be the case even if
the practitioner first sat, but failed, the MOrth
examination.
Section 57(2) pathway: specialist registration
“by” (as in “per force of”) the imposition of conditions
acceptance of an undertaking.
explained above, the question of whether Dr Taddei may be granted specialist
registration pursuant to s 57(2) (as construed by
the Queensland Court of Appeal
, and applied by the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal
) was first identified about one week after the oral hearing on
17 and 18 July 2024, with the parties filing written submissions which
respectively received on 23 August, 4 September, 16 September, and 18 September
Tribunal is bound to apply the Queensland Court of Appeal’s construction
(and thus also s 57(2)) in
unless satisfied or
“convinced” that it is “plainly wrong”. A perusal of the
authorities demonstrates that,
whilst differing views have been identified, no
Australian Tribunal has formed that conclusion. Nor does this Tribunal. Nor did
Board so submit, although (as discussed below) it sought to narrow the ambit
of the s 57(2) registration power to facts such as pertained
Accordingly
the s 57(2) pathway for specialist registration must be applied regarding
Dr Taddei’s application.
starting point for consideration of the registration pathway in 57(2) is the
Queensland Court of Appeal’s statutory construction
, which is set out above. The judgment in
, together with
all reported authorities about
and analogous provisions of which the
Tribunal is aware, are discussed herein (including as footnoted), particularly
to inform the
Tribunal’s decision as to whether or not Dr Taddei’s
circumstances are an “appropriate case” to grant specialist
registration in orthodontics pursuant to s 57(2).
Taddei submitted that specialist registration should be granted (with possible
conditions identified), as
short, s 57(2) allows for the Tribunal to consider whether, as a matter of
substance, the practitioner is eligible for specialist
registration with the
imposition of conditions or an undertaking. It appears to be designed for
precisely this type of scenario –
i.e. where Dr Taddei (like Dr
George) is clearly, as a matter of substance, suitable for specialist
registration, but where he does
not strictly satisfy the
‘qualification’ requirements of s 58. Accordingly, the Tribunal
should exercise its discretion
under s 57(2) in Dr Taddei’s favour.
As to the appropriate conditions or undertaking to apply - Dr Taddei is more
than willing to abide by whatever reasonable ‘conditions’
‘undertakings’ may be required of him for this purpose.
In the context of practice in Darwin, where there do not appear to be any
appropriate supervisors physically present, Dr Taddei proposes
following may be appropriate conditions for the Tribunal to impose:
(a) Supervision of his practice (carried out remotely). Dr Taddei could, for
example, consult with a supervisor (Orthodontist) approved
by the Dental Board.
The consult could be by telephone, video conference or other means of
telecommunication say once a month (or
another interval) to discuss the
management of patients. This could be done after the care is given to a patient
and would be consistent
with AHPRA’s Supervised Practice Framework
(attached).
(b) Dr Taddei understands that dental practitioners are required to do 60 hours
of CPD over 3 years. A possible condition could be
to require Dr Taddei to
complete 100 hours of CPD, namely 80 hours on clinical or scientifically-based
activities and 20 hours on
non-scientific activities.
(c) An Audit of Dr Taddei’s practice say within 12 months of this
condition being imposed.
his reply Dr Taddei clarified that, in his submission, “any one of these
three conditions may suffice of itself” to
facilitate registration, whilst
appreciating that the Tribunal may consider that “some other form of
condition [or undertaking]
appropriate”.
Board did not submit that the statutory construction of
as applied to s 57(2) in
, was wrongly decided. Indeed the
Board accepted that registration by imposition of conditions could occur in
“an appropriate
case”, but contended that the registration power in
s 57(2) had only a narrow ambit which was limited to facts such as
. The Board
Board accepts it is open to a responsible tribunal to impose conditions on
registration under s 57(2) of the National Law in an
appropriate case. However,
it does not accept this is an appropriate case in which to impose conditions
under s 57(2) or that the
conditions proposed by the Applicant would be
sufficient to address the reasons why the Applicant is not qualified for
registration
under s 58 of the National Law.
In particular, unlike the conditions imposed in George, the conditions
advanced by the Applicant in this case would not result in
the Applicant having
involvement in an ‘approved course of study’ that could lead to any
of the ‘approved qualifications’
for orthodontics.
Also, while remote supervision at regular intervals might assist the
Applicant to better practice orthodontics by providing input
to his management
of patients, it would not:
(a) involve any assessment or even supervision of his technical skills in the
that an ‘approved course of study’ leading to an
‘approved qualification’ would;
(b) address the concerns raised by Dr Lewis in his reports and oral evidence.
short, the Board’s position is that to grant specialist registration to
Dr Taddei under s 57(2), a condition would need to
be crafted which
(as it were) equates to a full year of supervised postgraduate study in
orthodontics, so as to rectify the deficiency
in his 2001 qualification. The
Board contends that this is what happened to facilitate specialist registration
, but that it cannot realistically be done in
Dr Taddei’s circumstances – including because “remote
supervision
at regular intervals” would not “involve any assessment
or even supervision of [Dr Taddei’s] technical skills in
the way that an
‘approved course of study’ leading to an ‘approved
qualification’ would” achieve.
submission is misplaced, and cannot be accepted. It presumes that, pursuant to
specialist registration under the s 57(2) pathway,
the sole or principal object
of an imposed condition is to itself rectify a deficiency in a qualification,
particularly and only
by involving a practitioner in a supervised course of
study or practice. That is not an accurate description of the underlying
circumstances
which appropriately facilitated specialist registration in
. Moreover the Board’s position reflects an unjustified
construction of s 57(2) and its ambit which is unduly narrow and inflexible,
which is inconsistent with the Queensland Court of Appeal’s exposition in
George was the Director of Studies at Griffith University for a postgraduate
qualification in endodontics, and was “closely
involved” in
lecturing, supervising and assessing postgraduates who were studying for an
“approved qualification”
– albeit that “the overall
supervision of the course and the students, and therefore also [Dr
George’s] work [ie
as a lecturer, but not his private endodontic
practice], is in the hands of a registered specialist endodontist, as required
[Dental Board]”. The Queensland Tribunal accepted that, in that
capacity, Dr George would “have a good grasp of all parts
of the course,
including those parts he does not teach himself” – such that, by the
time “the first set of students
have completed the course [ie from
2020 to 2022], he will be in substantially the same position as they are in
terms of their study
of endodontics, if not indeed in a better position, because
of his longer practical
experience”.
is, in addition to appreciating that Dr George’s position as the Director
of Studies was ultimately subject to the “overall
supervision” of a
registered specialist endodontist (who supported Dr George’s application),
the Queensland Tribunal
was also satisfied from Dr George’s knowledge,
skills and experience (as confirmed by references which “speak highly
his skill and expertise”) that he was “thoroughly familiar with the
subject” of endodontics (both from academic
work and “for
years” conducting a private “practice essentially as a specialist
endodontist”), and that registration
would not be “in any way

finding underpinned the Queensland Tribunal’s acceptance that it was

circumstances, to grant

appreciated, being satisfied from Dr George’s extensive experience that
was in substance no risk to the “protection of the public”
(which is of “paramount”
importance),
the purpose of
the conditions was principally to fulfil other objectives and guiding principles
of the National Law, particularly
to: “facilitate the rigorous and
responsive assessment of overseas-trained health practitioners”
; “facilitate access to services provided by health practitioners
in accordance with the public interest”
(s 3(2)(e))
; “enable the
continuous development of a flexible, responsive and sustainable Australian
health workforce”
(s 3(2)(f))
; and to ensure that the scheme operates in
an “efficient, effective and fair way” (s 3A(2)(a)), with
“restrictions”
only imposed to the extent “necessary to ensure
health services are provided safely and are of an appropriate quality”
that respect, in determining what is “an appropriate case” for
registration pursuant to s 57(2) (being the determinant
identified by the
NSW Tribunal in
, and also adopted by the Board in the above extract),
it is important to do so by reference to fulfilling the objectives and guiding
principles of National Law (as extracted in the preceding paragraph). The word
“appropriate” means “suitable or
fitting for a particular
purpose”; plainly enough registration by conditions which fulfil those
statutory objects and guiding
principles of the National Law will be
“suitable or fitting” to those “particular purpose[s]”
“appropriate”.
the Board’s submission is misplaced is also evident from the Queensland
Court of Appeal’s judgment in
, which explained that the power
to grant general (or specialist) registration in
(or s 57(2))
is not “limited to any particular set of circumstances, much less
extraordinary circumstances”. In doing
so the Court of Appeal rejected a
contrary submission by the National Board in that proceeding, which sought to
limit the registration
to “extraordinary
circumstances”.
the Board’s submission that the registration power in s 57(2) has only a
narrow ambit which is limited to facts such as
pertained in
substance, is simply another way of submitting that the power can only be used
in “extraordinary circumstances”.
So appreciated, the Board’s
submitted constraint on statutory power is inconsistent with the Court of
Appeal’s exposition
contrary to the Board’s submission for Dr Taddei that “remote
supervision” would be insufficient to justify
exercise of the power in s
the Queensland Court of Appeal endorsed “conditions
requiring supervised practice for a period” (involving a “supervised
practice plan” and “quarterly reports”, and a “report on
application for renewal of
registration”).
fact that any supervision for Dr Taddei would be remote (due to his orthodontic
practice being in Darwin and an absence of suitable
supervisors in that city)
does not preclude the operation of
, particularly in circumstances where
Dr Taddei has extensive experience and has been
unconditionally
registered as a specialist orthodontist in the United Kingdom since
January 2020.
Board also footnoted a passage in
Nowlan v Medical Board of Australia (No
[2020] QCAT 287
as supporting its position that, pursuant to s
57(2), the sole or principal object of an imposed condition is to itself rectify
deficiency in a
qualification.
circumstances of Mr Nowlan’s unsuccessful applications for provisional
registration as a medical practitioner (pending
completion of undergraduate
examinations) are outlined above, having been the subject of several adverse
decisions by Queensland
and NSW Tribunals.
Nowlan’s circumstances were very different to those for Dr George (and Dr
Taddei), and unsurprisingly the Queensland Tribunal’s
task in relation to
registration by imposed conditions was correspondingly different. Mr Nowlan had
no practical experience as a
registered medical practitioner, and consequently
the only question was whether imposed conditions could rectify the deficiencies
in his incomplete and deficient studies. Unsurprisingly the Queensland Tribunal
had no difficulty in concluding that conditions could
not “make up for his
unsatisfactory academic progress”. Provisional registration by imposed
conditions would not accord
with the “paramount” guiding principle
of protecting the public, and “ensuring that only health practitioners who
are suitably trained and qualified to practice in a competent and ethical manner
are registered”.
it is also unsurprising that the Queensland Tribunal had no difficulty in
concluding that Dr George should be registered
as a specialist endodontist
pursuant to s 57(2), since – unlike Mr Nowlan – Dr George had
extensive experience and practice
which rectified deficiencies in his overseas
qualification. For that reason the imposed condition which facilitated
specialist registration
for Dr George effectively applied only for the remainder
of the 2022 calendar year (rather than an extended period) with a review
of 18 months (as per s 83(2)), and required only that he “remain at least
as closely involved” with the postgraduate
endodontics course for which he
was the Director of Studies at Griffith University.
pursuant to his employment contract, Dr George was fully committed to
fulfilling his Director of Studies role throughout
2022. So appreciated the
imposed condition for Dr George was not onerous; indeed it did not require
him to do anything additional
or different to what he was already contractually
bound to do and would have done anyway as the Director of Studies. Moreover,
George’s private practice in endodontics was not the subject of
supervisory conditions or regular audits, and he was not required
to complete
any endodontic courses additional to his continuing professional development
obligations.
these circumstances it may have been appropriate, if s 83A had been in force on
3 February 2022 (this amendment took effect later
that year), for the
Queensland Tribunal to consider registration pursuant to s 57(2) by
acceptance of an undertaking under s 83A
(in the same terms as the conditions)
– rather than the formal imposition of conditions. The Queensland Court of
construction in
must mean that registration by
acceptance of an undertaking is now an option contemplated by s 57(2).
Board also relied, in the above extract from its written submission, on
“concerns” said to have been “raised by Dr Lewis in
his reports and oral evidence”
to registration. This reliance is misplaced; the evidence reveals that Dr Lewis
was not apprised
that the s 57(2) pathway for specialist registration
existed – particularly as explained herein. A perusal of the Board’s
terms of reference and enclosures to Dr Lewis confirms that this was the
that respect Dr Lewis was asked whether, given Dr Taddei’s extensive
orthodontics practice for over 20 years and specialist
registration in the
United Kingdom since 24 January 2020, he “should be granted
specialist registration subject to conditions”.
Dr Lewis rejected
this option given his understanding that the regulatory pathway in the United
Kingdom “does not have an equivalency”
under the National Law. In
clinical and non-clinical practice of orthodontics has no relevance to an
application for specialist registration with the Dental
Board of Australia.
Specialist registration in Orthodontics should not be granted. Specialist
registration certifies to the general public and the profession
that the holder
is a qualified specialist in their field. It would be inappropriate to place a
condition on the registration based
on the individuals lacking of a specialist
qualification.
conclusion, according to Dr Lewis there was only one pathway in Australia
whereby Dr Taddei could be granted specialist registration,
completion of a three year Doctor of Clinical Dentistry in Orthodontics from one
of five Australian universities) (ie an “approved
qualification”).
evidence demonstrates that Dr Lewis did not appreciate that, as construed in
and applied in
, s 57(2) provides a pathway for
specialist registration “by” (as in “per force of”)
conditions which involves
consideration of a practitioner’s knowledge,
skills and experience (as well as the practitioner’s deficient
qualification).
That is, contrary to Dr Lewis’s understanding, the
“clinical and non-clinical practice of orthodontics” is relevant
specialist registration under s 57(2).
Dr Mahony was not apprised of the s 57(2) pathway particularly as explained
herein, noting that Dr Taddei and his legal representatives
were not aware of
the Queensland Tribunal’s decision in
until after the
Mahony considered that Dr Taddei’s two year 2001 Master of Science
(Orthodontics) qualification was “substantially equivalent, or based
on similar competencies” to a three year Australian
qualification”, such that he should be granted specialist registration
under s 58(b) – which the Tribunal
does not accept (as detailed above). In
that context (ie of registration occurring under s 58(b)), by reference to Dr
knowledge, skills and experience, Dr Mahony considered that there
should not be “any conditions imposed on his specialist
registration”.
Mahony was not aware of the s 57(2) pathway, or its operation, when expressing
this opinion – particularly that registration
occurs by imposition of
conditions (or, since 2022, by acceptance of an undertaking). Nonetheless Dr
Mahony plainly accepts that
the evidence in substance justifies specialist
registration for Dr Taddei, provided that a legal pathway may facilitate that
Dr Mahony’s position accords with that of Dr Leedham in his
supportive reference dated 11 May 2022.
Tribunal considers, on review, that the evidence comprehensively demonstrates
that Dr Taddei should be registered as a specialist
orthodontist via the s 57(2)
pathway, specifically by the imposition of conditions under s 83 or the
acceptance of an undertaking
under s 83A.
Tribunal accepts, adapting the language of the Appeal Panel of the General
Dental Council in 2020, that (together with his 2001
qualification)
Dr Taddei’s “knowledge of and experience in orthodontics is
equivalent to the knowledge and experience
which he might reasonably be expected
to have acquired if he had undertaken the training required” for a current
“approved qualification”.
forming that conclusion the Tribunal is satisfied that a grant of specialist
registration to Dr Taddei pursuant to s 57(2) would
fulfil the objectives and
guiding principles of the National Law, including that the “protection of
the public” is of
“paramount” importance.
Consequently
the Tribunal considers that the correct, or preferable, decision is that
specialist registration be granted to Dr Taddei
on that basis (ie in
substitution for the Committee's decision, which is set

Dr Taddei’s orthodontics practice; completion
of additional

is because, throughout its consideration of Dr Taddei’s application and
including before the Tribunal, the Board has taken
successive legal positions
which deny that there is power under s 57(2) to facilitate specialist
registration.
the reasons explained above, the Tribunal does not accept those legal positions,
and thus considers that there is ample power
under s 57(2) (as construed in
, and applied in
) to grant specialist registration to Dr
Taddei in the specialty of orthodontics.
Tribunal also considers that the evidence comprehensively demonstrates that such
a grant of specialist registration should occur,

statutory expression as s 57(b) of the National Law. The Court of Appeal
explained (at [14]):
“On the face of it, the comparison required by the first limb of the
sub-paragraph [ie s 111(1)(b)(ii)] is that of one type
of formal qualification
with another. The concept of substantial equivalence calls for a comparison of
like with like. Thus, a qualification
in the subject specialty considered by the
board to be substantially equivalent to a qualification referred to in
sub-paragraph (b)(i),
must be, on the face of it, a reference to a formal
qualification granted by an appropriate professional body, or, perhaps, a
governmental
authority.”
20(3)(c) of the
Health Practitioners Act 2004
(NT) provided for
registration (including as a dentist, dental specialist, medical practitioner,
nurse, physiotherapist and other
health professions) where a person had
“experience and training in the category of registration or enrolment that
considers is at least substantially equivalent to the successful
completion of an accredited course in the category of registration
enrolment”. Further, a person who was not otherwise eligible could also be
registered if the relevant Board was “satisfied
that accepting the
application and registering or enrolling the person is in the public interest or
meets a community need”

Change to bi-collegiate MOrth examination (Discontinuation of

accepted that completion of the MOrth examination would be an additional
“qualification” which under s 58(b) would be comparatively
considered “together” with Dr Taddei’s 2001
two year Master of

Taddei in a “much better”

that s 58(b) would be satisfied.
Dr Lewis was circumspect. He emphasised in

that “Simply
holding a MOrth on top of his current thing [the two year

satisfying s 58(b); “the 3 year approved post graduate program would still
be lacking” (expert report Dr Lewis 11 July
