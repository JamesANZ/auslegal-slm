IN THE NAME OF CARE: REPRODUCING INSTITUTIONAL HARM THROUGH
THE PREDICTIVE GOVERNANCE OF
YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT 1997
CHUFENG XIANG
Young Offenders Act 1997
(NSW) exemplifies how early intervention
frameworks can (re)produce institutional harm under the stated purpose of care
and prevention.
Informed by Zedner’s theory of pre-crime, this article
argues that the Act legitimises harmful forms of state intervention
constructing targeted young people as ‘high-risk’ through
background-based classification. The requirement that young
people make
admission as a precondition for ‘diversion’ is shown to erode the
presumption of innocence and constrain
the exercise of moral and legal agency.
Together, these mechanisms – risk identification, procedural
preconditions, and moral
expectations – form an interconnected structure
of governance that accelerates criminalisation under the guise of diversion.
Rather than offering protection, the Act operationalises a forward-looking mode
of control that reproduces harm through institutional
INTRODUCTION
A recurring practice can be observed in quantitative research and empirical
interview materials on children and young people targeted
by police: researchers
often record whether the interviewed young people come from ‘drug-using
families’, and treat this
background as a predictive variable for
assessing their likelihood of subsequent offending or contact with the justice
This variable is widely
collected and operationalised, yet few ask: why is this something we need to
In these studies, ‘coming from drug-using families’ is treated as
a taken-for-granted risk factor, and its legitimacy
appears to require no
justification. It is this ‘self-evident’ categorisation that
constitutes the starting point of
this article. By questioning the institutional
significance of ‘drug-using families’ as a risk label, I aim to
when early intervention mechanisms mark certain teenagers as
‘high-risk’ in the name of prediction and prevention, can
identification be neutral? Has it become a mode of
governance?
And to what extent does
the mechanism itself construct the so-called ‘high-risk’
identification?
Research Questions
This article asks whether crime prevention and early intervention strategies
– often framed as supportive responses to youth
– function as
genuine protective measures, or whether they reproduce institutional harm under
the guise of care.
It examines how
predictive frameworks, by embedding seemingly neutral indicators such as family
background or behavioural traits,
classify certain young people as
‘high-risk’ and pre-emptively govern them not on the basis of
presumed criminality rather
than actual conduct.

(‘admissions’) as a precondition

agency in behavioural
and moral judgment, but instead presupposes them as
perpetrators who ought to bear moral responsibility. Part IV concludes by
how these three governance mechanisms reinforce one another, forming an
institutional chain of harm enacted in the name of ‘care’.
Historical and Conceptual Foundations
Since the 1990s, early intervention and crime prevention have been widely
regarded by scholars and policymakers as progressive, humane,
and effective
alternatives to punitive approaches. From what James Howell called ‘a
valuable alternative to punitive
to what Francis
Cullen et al describe as ‘a progressive and rational policy
this strategy has
gained significant recognition in both academic and policy domains. This framing
– initially presented as
a rational response to social disadvantage
– continues to shape contemporary thinking. For instance, in 2016, Paul
referred to early intervention in New South Wales (‘NSW’)
as part of ‘an enlightened system of juvenile
Between 2019 and
2020, several researchers continued to describe such strategies using terms such
as ‘protective’, ‘necessary
to prevent later offending’,
and ‘supportive and empowering’, reaffirming the normative appeal of
this policy orientation.
Young Offenders Act 1997
Legislative Embodiment of Early Intervention
In Australia, early intervention and risk-oriented strategies of management
and control have been widely promoted at the crime policy
level since the late
At the national level, specific practices include the National Crime
Prevention Framework and the Communities for Children program.
Furthermore, this
preventive logic has been adopted in legislation across various states and
territories, including the
Juvenile Justice Act 1992
Offenders Act 1994
Young Offenders Act 1997
(NSW), and the
Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998
(NSW). Programs
Youth on Track
in NSW clearly reflect this trend through their
inclusion criteria, which incorporate youth regarded as ‘high-risk’
on background assessment tools.
This article takes the

‘early intervention’ (re)produces harm to young people subjected to

The reason why the

legislation in Queensland and Western Australia is that it was enacted later and

mature and complete system. The

mechanisms, including warnings, formal cautions and youth justice conferences.
It constitutes a representative
and developed institutional design within the
framework of policing young people.
Theoretical Framework: Responding to Structural
Although early intervention is widely applied, the assumptions on which it is
based are often unexamined. First, risk indicators such
as ‘coming from a
drug-using family’ are typically treated as objective facts that are used
for judgment, without reflection
on the social processes through which they are
constructed. Second, the state’s early involvement is presumed to be
protective, despite evidence to the contrary, and may in fact erode
legal safeguards and exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. Third,
the focus on
individual and familial traits obscures deeper structural sources of harm.
To analyse these presumptions, this article draws on Lucia Zedner’s
concept of pre-crime, which exposes a logic of predictive
governance. In this
model, state intervention is not based on what individuals have done, but on
what the state predicts they might
do. As Zedner argues, a pre-crime society is
‘a society in which the possibility of forestalling risks competes with
takes precedence over responding to wrongs
Through this
theoretical framework, this article reveals how control operates behind
protective narratives and how harm is institutionally
reproduced.

Peter Johnstone said, the Act is ‘a statutory embodiment of early

orientation is not only visible in policy discourse but is also presented in the
legislation itself.
Diversion, as framed under the
, refers to pre-court interventions
conducted by police officers, including inside police stations. The intervention
may be warnings,
formal cautions, and youth justice conferences. These measures
are designed to redirect young people away from formal judicial proceedings
avoid custodial sentencing. Diversion is often lauded for its potential to
reduce ‘(re)offending’, alleviate pressure
on courts, and address
the underlying social and developmental needs of children and young people.
However, this model of ‘diversion’
is narrowly confined to diversion
away from court, rather than from the criminalisation process as a whole.
Crucially, diversion
remains largely police-controlled, operating without
judicial oversight. It is, by definition, initiated after the child has been
subjected to police attention of some kind, that is, police have already
stopped, questioned, detained, and usually arrested the
child before any formal
‘diversion’ process starts. As such,
intervention-diversion does not prevent the primary determinant of
criminalisation, which is police attention, because it is a form
attention. ‘Diversion’ instead functions as a secondary procedural
filter – one that reinforces the police
as gatekeepers of
criminalisation.
The legislative language of the
clearly reflects a
prevention–intervention logic. For instance, section 19 authorises the use
of a formal police caution for
‘a child who is alleged to have committed
the offence’ – that is, a child who has not pleaded nor been found
and is thus presumed innocent at law – explicitly for the purpose
of ‘preventing
offending’. This formulation reveals
ideas of crime prevention and early intervention within the statutory design,
Act an appropriate object of critical analysis from a pre-crime
perspective.
To analyse the preventive claims of the
is not only to demonstrate
that the legislation is indeed ‘preventive’ rather than
‘punitive’ in orientation,
but more importantly, to reveal how this
preventive logic affects its target population – namely, youth classified
as ‘high-risk’.
Early intervention and prevention frameworks and
programs are not evenly or randomly distributed across the youth population. On
the contrary, these programs are structurally designed, from the outset, to
target and govern a specific group: those youth classified
‘high-risk’. These youth are not accidentally or passively included
in the system, but are selected and pre-identified
subjects and targets under
the logic of preventive governance. As cited by Zedner, Pat
and Richard

framework does not wait for the
finding of guilt in a court, but is institutionally constructed through a series
of background features
that are not controllable by the targeted child –
such as parents’ drug use, access to the welfare system, and behavioural
assessments.
As demonstrated further below, analysis shows that this kind of intervention,
targeting youth classified as ‘high-risk’,

youth classified as ‘high-risk’. This is evident not only in the
system’s conceptual
design, but also in the outcomes of its practical
implementation. The risk identification mechanism of the
ostensibly centres on behavioural representation and functions as a neutral
screening tool, in practice lacks the ability
or willingness to recognise the
cultural significance behind behaviours. This results in a significant
disadvantage to Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander children and young people,
and other marginalised groups. Risk assessment is not an equally applicable
universal procedure; rather, it becomes a mechanism that, during implementation,
categorises individuals along class and cultural
lines. It magnifies
institutional biases to further entrench marginalised (‘high risk’)
young people in criminal processes
and redirect privileged (‘low
risk’) people out of the system.
For instance, Aboriginal cultural practices may be
misidentified as ‘high-risk self-harm’ or ‘mental
abnormality’.
Dr Tracey Westerman, a proud Nyamal woman from the Pilbara
region of Western Australia, points out in her research that in Indigenous
cultures, cultural skin-cutting behaviours (such as ‘sorry cutting’)
and ‘deliberate self-harm’ in the Western
psychological and
psychiatric clinical sense have completely different

cutting can serve to ‘demonstrate respect for the deceased’ and

specific contexts, a cultural act of seeking resolution to pain and loss is
pathologised by state authorities.
Similar cultural practices – such as
‘lore cuts’ (coming-of-age scars) and ‘payback’
(disciplinary rituals
led by elders) – may also be misinterpreted by
non-Indigenous assessors as violence or self-harm due to their apparent
If the behaviour occurs
in a collective setting, is regulated by cultural rules, and does not pose fatal
risks, it constitutes a
form of cultural expression within Indigenous groups.
Mainstream assessment mechanisms, however, are uniformly applied using
externally-determined
classifications, thereby disregarding cultural context and
triggering ‘high-risk’-based state interventions. The current
identification and diversion thresholds leave no room for cultural
interpretation.
Instead, they collapse cultural mourning, punishment, and initiation
ceremonies into a single ‘pathology–hazard’
coordinate system,
directly causing over-labelling and stigmatisation of Indigenous young people.
It is well-documented that state
intervention in the lives of Indigenous
families in fact causes (not prevents) harm. As Ingrid Matthews and Emily Holden

alienation’.
In the child
protection context, legal reforms have shifted removal justifications from overt
racial categories to softer grounds
such as ‘neglect’ and
‘emotional abuse’ under the

refusing to recognise
Indigenous caregiving as valid or protective in its own right. This reflects the
enduring influence of white
paternalist and colonial logics, which refuse to
recognise certain caregiving practices – understood within Indigenous
as acts of care – as legitimate, simply because they do not
conform to dominant, Western norms of parenting and protection,
providing an institutional rationale for ongoing state surveillance,
intervention, and disruption of Indigenous family life.

approaches such as warnings, formal cautions and youth justice conferences are
portrayed as alternative and non-penal
measures, they are not universally
applied to all youth, but disproportionately target and classify impoverished
children as ‘high-risk’.
As Richards points out, ‘they are
highly visible to police and other criminal justice authorities and come under a
high degree
of criminal justice scrutiny’.
Once placed on this
institutional track, now known to police, each subsequent point of contact,
including specifically targeted contact
through the now-abolished Suspect target
Mangement Program, further confirms and entrenches their identification as
offenders’.
Moreover, the legal dimension – recorded admissions for the purpose of
rendering a child or young person ineligible within
three instances – is
understated. The language of ‘offender’ is used of presumptively
innocent children, while
charges brought or threatened by police (a serious and
traumatising process) are reconstructed as admissions of wrongdoing made by

child has been dealt with by caution on three

generates a record trail that justifies future police surveillance
and intervention. This article argues that the
regime, with its
recorded warnings and admissions, are not merely a process of categorisation but
constitute a mode of governance.

criminalisation in heavily policed areas.
As Zedner notes, the ‘shift to pre-crime’ entails that

, this mechanism issues a clear
institutional signal to youth who have not broken the law: they are not merely
‘potential offenders’
but are pre-categorised as those who
‘will offend’. Here, ‘prevention’ is not a neutral
strategy of social
support, but a forward-oriented form of exclusion – its
purpose being to incorporate these youth into a distinct track of governance
under the justification of ‘future offence’ and operationalised by
police surveillance, thereby simultaneously justifying
and accelerating
criminalisation processes.
Once young people are classified as a ‘high-risk’ group, the
institutional trajectory proscribes presumption of innocence
and replaces it
with presumption of future offending – directly denying the application of
this foundational legal principle.
In the case of
Bugmy v The Queen
High Court of Australia clearly pointed out that extreme deprivation and social
exclusion experienced by individuals
during childhood does not
‘naturally’ dissipate over time and should still be regarded as
significant mitigating factors
when assessing criminal
responsibility.
This judgment,
and the precedent it sets, recognises that childhood deprivation is a social

However, the

but uses it specifically to filter some children out of the system and

deeper into it. The fundamental problem with this
transformation lies in the fact that it dissolves the explanatory and mitigating
functions that specific backgrounds ought to serve in criminal responsibility
assessment. Instead, it constructs groups with these
specific backgrounds as
risks and problems to be dealt with in advance.
RESPONSIBILITY AS ADMISSION: HOW THE
UNDERMINES THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE
repeatedly frames itself as a protective and non-criminal
alternative to conventional legal processes.
Section 3(a)
defines one of its
primary objects as ‘establish[ing] a scheme that provides an alternative
process to court proceedings’
through cautions, warnings, and youth
justice conferences.
Section 7(c)
further articulates the principle that
‘criminal proceedings are not to be instituted against a child if there is
an alternative
and appropriate means of dealing with the matter’, and
subsection (d) reinforces that criminal procedures should not be used
a gateway to welfare interventions. Collectively, these provisions construct an
image of a child-centred legal regime that
avoids criminalisation and promotes
rehabilitation.
On its face, the Act’s emphasis on ‘acceptance of
responsibility’ appears aligned with restorative justice goals
encouraging young people to acknowledge the impact of their actions and engage
in reparative processes. This language is
prominently featured in section
3(c)(ii), which frames the purpose of youth justice conferences as emphasising
‘restitution
by the offender and the acceptance of responsibility by the
offender for his or her behaviour’ – where ‘the
is, by definition, a presumptively innocent child. Similarly,
section 34(1)(a)(i) identifies one of the guiding principles of conferencing
promoting ‘acceptance by the child concerned of responsibility for his or
her own behaviour’. Such words construct
a normative vision of
rehabilitation grounded in participation and responsibility.
However, the Act clearly stipulates the legal meaning of ‘taking
responsibility’: that is, admitting to an allegation,
which is called an
‘offence’ in the
Under sections 19(b) and
36(b), a child is eligible to receive a caution or participate in a youth
justice conference only if they
admit to doing the ‘offence’ –
this being the term used in the
itself – which in practice
means doing whatever it is police have alleged, even though such conduct has not
been adjudicated
by any court. This legal structure directly equates

uniformed officers,

The conclusion that presumption of innocence has been replaced by presumption
of dangerousness, drawn through analysis of the Act’s
provisions, is
supported by empirical research. Estrella Pearce’s empirical research with

that, in practice, these

interpretations, such figures are often taken as evidence that these young

shortcomings
in the restorative
idea of youth justice conferences. However, from the critical perspective of
pre-crime, the reason they do not
apologise may be the coercion attached to the
condition precedent, of admissions to police allegations. Their presence in the
justice conference confirms that they had already made admissions to the
allegations because admission is a precondition for
participation
. However, their
unwillingness to apologise sincerely during the conference indicates that this
admission may reflect strategic compliance
under institutional conditions of
coercion. The low rate of apology reveals this structural contradiction:
although the unapologetic
and reluctantly apologetic participants admit to the
allegation/s, they are not, in law nor in their own hearts, guilty.
This contradiction between admission and lack of internal recognition reveals
that the institutional design of the
, and its precondition of
admissions, in practice significantly erodes the core criminal law principle of
presumptive innocence. The
presumption of innocence not only requires that the
court shall not consider the defendant guilty before hearing the evidence or
guilty plea, but also that at every stage of the judicial process, the accused
shall not be compelled to incriminate
themselves.
By setting admission
of offence as a precondition for accessing ‘diversionary’
mechanisms, the
effectively alters the structure of the burden of
proof by requiring children who have not been convicted by a court to relinquish
their right to remain silent in exchange for institutional
‘protection’ from incarceration. This design shifts pleading
from a consequence of judicial conviction to a threshold for initiating the
system, blurring the boundary between judicial
determination and administrative
classification. Ultimately, the
regime no longer takes innocence as
its starting point but instead presumes wrongdoing as the basis for procedural
operation, thereby
substantially weakening the core legal status that
presumption of innocence is said to guarantee.
THE DENIAL OF AGENCY: LEGAL AND MORAL
JUDGMENT PRECLUDED UNDER THE
In the institutional pathway constructed by the

‘restorative’ justice mechanism, yet their agency

severely constrained. The
requires an admission of responsibility as
a precondition for access to non-judicial mechanisms. This is provided in
sections 19
and 36, which set the conditions for the application of warnings and
youth justice conferences – both of which require the
young person to make
admissions. As detailed above, this means young people must acknowledge their
conduct is unlawful without judicial
determination, but rather under the
supervision of police officers in a police station.
This precondition not only has significance in procedure, but also
presupposes the youth’s capacity for subjective judgment.
The current
mechanism does not distinguish between differences among individuals
in cognitive maturity and moral judgment, resulting in some
youth who lack the
capacity for moral responsibility being wrongly included in the institutional
logic of ‘having agency’.
This institutional neglect has already
received a clear response in
In this case, the
High Court pointed out that the key to determining whether a youth can bear
criminal responsibility lies in whether
they understand the
‘wrongness’ of their own behaviour. This precedent indirectly
challenges the practice of taking admissions
by the accused child as the
starting point of ‘diversion’ measures. In other words, for youth
who do not yet have the
capacity to judge the morality of their own actions, the
system requires that they assess the moral
scope of their
actions. This not only lacks practical foundation but may also constitute a
fabrication and misreading of their subjective
In this situation, an ‘admission’ is no longer an expression
based on autonomous judgment, but a mechanical repetition
of institutional
discourse. The child might say ‘I made a serious mistake’ due to
legal advice, institutional incentives,
or environmental pressure, but this
expression neither represents their true will nor reflects their understanding
of the normative
content of the criminal charge. The system does not reserve
space for judgment or silence for such youth. Instead, it designates
subjects capable of independent decision-making through a pre-positioned
‘accountability’ mechanism, thereby
eliminating the necessary
recognition of differences in agency and capacity.
In contrast to the youth ‘whose cognition is not yet mature’ as
mentioned earlier, another group of youth have subjectively
acquired the ability
to assess their own behaviour – that is, they can understand the
character, impact, and potential harm
of their conduct. For them, this entry
requirement is not merely a procedural restriction, but also substantially
deprives them of
the right to make a rational judgment regarding their own
As Zedner explains, ‘yet even if it appears almost certain that the
person will commit an offence, respect for the individual
as a moral agent must
acknowledge a categorical “window of moral opportunity” or chance to
remain innocent’. To
close this window pre-emptively ‘fails to

places particular emphasis on expectations of remorse and
consequent victim satisfaction.
For example, section 3(c)(iii) identifies ‘meeting the needs of
victims’ as one of the Act’s core objectives. Section
34(3) further
provides that ‘participants are to have regard to ... (c) the need to
empower families and victims in making
decisions about a child’s offending
behaviour, and (d) the need to make reparation to any victim’. These
institutional
provisions generate a strong moral expectation that young people
will express apologies and accept responsibility for harm caused
during youth justice conferences.
The problem, however, is that this responsibility is not voluntarily
undertaken by the young person; it is institutionally presupposed.
In practice,
victims may exercise veto power over the conference outcome, and expressions of
remorse–alongside victim satisfaction
– become key criteria in
evaluating the process.
effect, this framework undermines the young person’s moral agency –
that is, their capacity to determine whether they
believe harm was truly caused
and whether they genuinely wish to
In this scenario, some youth are forced to play the role of
‘repenters’ in exchange for entry into the
process. Even
if an individual subjectively possesses the moral and cognitive capacity to
judge the legality of their own behaviour,
the system does not provide a legal
avenue for expressing this capacity. The system formally retains
agency–that is, it presents
the appearance of being able to
‘choose’ – but in essence, it offers only one option
constructed and recognised
by the system: to admit one’s wrongs and
apologise to the victims. The
does not allow individuals to express
‘I don’t think I need to repent’, nor does it leave room for
‘I understand
the legal consequences, but I disagree with the police
assessment’. Each child or young person must either accept the
language and repeat it, or be excluded from the category of those
‘worth repairing’. Therefore, in many cases, admitting
apologising do not stem from an individual’s cognitive state, but are
imposed by institutional logic. In this way,
although the system nominally
promotes restorative justice and victim participation, it in fact excludes the
possibility for individuals
to independently think about and express views on
justice, harm, and responsibility – thereby fundamentally weakening their
status as subjects of moral judgment. The remaining ‘alternative’
pathway is to plead not guilty in the Children’s
Court. Children under 16
who are found guilty, even those who plead not guilty, are generally protected
from recorded convictions.
Not unusually, the institutional logic codified by the

provide an alternative path for all children and
young people who meet the age

– such as whether
the individual expresses remorse or demonstrates a
willingness to take responsibility – to the entry mechanism. This
institutional
setup essentially takes an individual’s moral performance as
a procedural threshold, making the
no longer a ‘special program
for youth’, but an exclusive mechanism for ‘youth who are willing to
make admissions’.
The result is that some youth, even if they formally
meet the application conditions of the Act, are excluded because they refuse
accept institutional moral retraining. This trend of replacing objective
standards with subjective ethics weakens the universal
applicability of
procedural justice – that is, it shrinks the scope of the Act’s
applicable group within the factual
upper limit.
In fact, introducing subjective ethics as the criterion for entering the
legal process undermines the objectivity of the system itself
it creates ambiguity in the criteria for the application of law. In the case of
RP v The Queen
, the court cited a frequently quoted comment by Professor
Glanville Williams: ‘the more warped the child’s moral standards,
the safer he is from the correctional treatment of the criminal
Although this
statement is often used to criticise juvenile justice for being overly lenient
towards so-called ‘bad kids’,
it also reveals a deeper problem: when
legal judgments rely on children’s subjective moral cognition, the
application of the
system will inevitably fall into unquantifiable subjective
assessments. Because moral understanding is inherently subjective and
children’s cognitive development is highly uneven, once the system takes
morally charged behaviours such as ‘voluntary’
admissions or
‘apologising to the victim’ as prerequisites for non-judicial
processes, it effectively uses individual
moral performance as a program
threshold – thereby creating inequality and uncertainty. This can lead to
additional unfair
consequences (beyond the originating unfairness of
over-policing impoverished areas).
As Professor Williams’ quote illustrates, the
purported intention, of screening those worthy of lenient treatment by setting
‘moral thresholds’, in practice
has not fulfilled the screening
function at all. Theoretically, the threshold is designed to distinguish
‘repentant youth’
from ‘stubborn individuals who refuse to
admit mistakes’, in order to achieve the institutional goals of targeted
allocation and restorative justice. However, in operation,
institutional incentives have led youth to strategically ‘admit
mistakes’ and ‘apologise’ in exchange for procedural benefits
– such as avoiding formal prosecution, the
trauma of the courtroom, and
potential incarceration.
As mentioned, above, Daly’s SAJJ project found that only 27% of victims
believed the youth’s apologies were out of sincere
remorse. It can be
reasonably inferred that a proportion of the remaining apologies were regarded
by victims as strategic responses.
This data clearly reflects that moral
expression under institutional incentives has gradually deviated from genuine
cognition and
reflection, and has instead transformed into a procedural
condition for eligibility. This data not only reveals the failure of the
institutional repentance mechanism, but also reflects a deeper flaw: the
institutional attempt to access ‘psychological states’
‘verbal behaviour’ suffers from a fundamental logical defect –
remorse cannot be effectively verified through
external conduct, and is instead
highly likely to become a tool for institutional manipulation and strategic
adaptation.
Under this institutional structure, the system claims to screen
‘salvageable’ youth based on moral judgment, but in reality,
fails to distinguish between sincerity and strategy, identification and
catering. The behavioural manifestation of ‘being
willing to admit to an
allegation made by police’ does not imply the establishment of moral
awareness or judicial trust, but
rather represents the only channel, under the
institutional setting, that is deemed ‘worthy of being remedied’.
Ultimately,
the ‘special procedures’ constructed by the institution
neither truly distinguish individual characteristics nor achieve
goals of restorative justice.
This structural paradox indicates that while the
system advocates
empowerment and restoration at the theoretical level, it reconstructs another
exclusion mechanism in practice through
pre-moral attribution. Those excluded
include both individuals who lack the ability to express themselves and those
who are capable
but unwilling to comply. However, those included may not be
truly ‘trustworthy’ either; they merely perform the correct
expression under institutional incentive. The moral threshold not only fails to
screen the ‘ideal restorative subject’
out of the criminalisation
process, but also amplifies institutional deviations and implementation risks,
thereby undermining the
foundation of justice that the system is supposed to
mechanism assumes that all youth have the ability and
willingness to express ‘admission of responsibility’ and
‘expression
of remorse’ in a clear and institutionally expected
manner. It has been discussed in the previous text that this mechanism
the cognitive development stages of youth and the ability differences among
individuals. It also fails to take into account
the differences in language
expression tendencies and emotional communication styles among youth from
different cultural backgrounds.
The expressive standard of
neutral and universal, but is in fact rooted in the value system of Western
white culture and is regarded as the only acceptable
standard. This
institutional design has caused highly disproportionate exclusive consequences
for Aboriginal youth in Australia.
As the Raise the Age campaign points out,
although Indigenous children make up only a small portion of the population,
they account
for 65% of the incarcerated population among the youngest age group
subject to criminalisation.
The preconditions that
acknowledges for avoiding court and
therefore incarceration – that is, the expression and response methods
sets and expects, such as ‘I did something wrong, I’m
sorry’ – imply a direct, individualised, and openly
pattern of responsibility and remorse. This model is rooted in the expressive
style and psychological language system of
a specific culture (ie, Western-white
culture) and lacks cross-cultural responsiveness. Even if youth subjectively
possess reflection
and remorse, if they fail to express it in a language
recognised by the system. For instance, Indigenous youth may feel remorse and
contrition internally while their articulation – which may include silence
as a mark of respect, and of listening – goes
unrecognised. Silence,
listening and learning may be construed as sullenness, lacking remorse, or
refusing to take responsibility,
thereby accelerating classification into the
‘high risk’ categories of legitimated surveillance and state
Returning to the findings of Nyamal psychologist Dr Tracey Westerman,
‘Aboriginal people who present in situations which are
foreign (outside of
cultural context)’ – where the colonial (criminal) law is indeed
foreign to the law of the land –
may also be ‘likely to appear more
agitated and distressed than

psychological response caused by cultural alienation and colonial trauma.
However, in the practice of the
mechanism, such reactions are likely
to be interpreted as confrontation, or as a failure to acknowledge wrongdoing or
potential physical
risk. Dr Westerman also explains the concept of shame, which
is described as ‘a factor affecting the clinical presentation

evident that cultural differences make it difficult for professionals to
accurately assess Indigenous people, let alone children
and young people under
the stressful circumstance of criminal processes. The
system requires
the young person being evaluated to articulate their emotional state while
expressing their sense of responsibility
and behaviour, using a language
framework grounded in Western psychology. However, police and other authorities
may not possess the
required means of understanding Indigenous cultural
expression.
Furthermore, Dr Westerman notes the place of ‘secretness’ in some
Aboriginal cultural contexts, which can profoundly influence
expression. As
Sheldon’s research points out, ‘there are a number of sensitive
topics within the assessment process that
clearly impact upon client
presentation’.
cultures have strong taboos regarding death, rituals, sex, and family. For
example, in some Indigenous cultures specific topic
sand even names can be
expressed only at specific times, in specific spaces, to specific people (and
not others) and under specific
identity conditions. Therefore, when authorities
interrogate the background or emotional motivations of an Indigenous young
the subject may default to remaining silent due to conflicting cultural
rules bearing on their situation. This silence is a contextually
response; however, authorities are likely to label the child or young person as
not taking responsibility or lacking remorse.
This imposition of foreign norms
on Indigenous children is then institutionally transformed into a moral and
legal labels: uneducatable,
culpable, unreformable. The cultural norms of the
Indigenous subject are colonised – displaced, owned – as
non-cooperation.
This may deprive Indigenous youth of eligibility for
restorative justice processes, it will almost certainly prompt increased and
ongoing police surveillance for the purpose of (re)criminalisation
(‘re-offending’).
Ultimately,
sets the form of language expression recognised by the
system as the entry threshold for the restorative process. On the surface,
system maintains formal equality, but it lacks cultural responsiveness –
including to the very cultural groups on whose
lands the criminalisation process
has been established. What is thus formed is not an individual judgment error,
but a systematic
and structural cultural exclusion mechanism. Indigenous youth
are systematically excluded from the category of ‘repairable
objects’ because gatekeepers of the restorative pathway are unable to
accurately assess cultural norms of expression.
not only classifies certain youth as ‘high-risk’
through risk-based identification, but also systematically constrains
agency at both the levels of rational assessment and moral response. These youth
are no longer treated as subjects capable
of autonomous judgment or moral
reasoning, but are institutionalised as objects of governance –
individuals to be corrected
and managed. This institutional structure, which
places young people under a logic of
attribution, constitutes a
structural suppression of agency and reconfiguration of the right to presumptive
innocence as presumptive
‘offender’. This presents a fundamental
challenge to the very discourse of rights, restoration, and care.
CONCLUSION: THE REPRODUCTIVE LOGIC OF
INSTITUTIONAL HARM
This article has examined the
as a representative framework of
state intervention, arguing that its institutional logic systematically
reproduces harm under the
guise of care and prevention. The harm identified here
is not incidental, nor a failure of policy intent. Rather, it emerges from
very mechanisms said to protect – structures that claim to mitigate risk
but ultimately generate new forms of structural
marginalisation and control.
These three findings constitute an institutional governance chain, with their
internal relationship reflected in a process of reproduction
that begins with
the institutional construction of risk, unfolds through procedural arrangements,
and is ultimately completed at
the level of subject recognition. The first
finding reveals that, in its design, the
presupposes non-privileged
children and young people as ‘future offenders’ through
background-based identification, thereby
constructing the social classification
of high-risk youth. This classification is not a neutral identification but
constitutes the
starting point and the source of governance legitimacy to
criminalise targeted children.
On this basis, the second finding points out that the system, by setting
‘assumption of responsibility’ as a prerequisite
for entering the
mechanism, denies the possibility of these youth maintaining an innocent stance
at the initial stage of the procedure.
This separates their legal status from
ordinary citizenship from the outset, transforming them into subjects who must,
without the
benefit of judicial oversight, concede their own criminal
culpability – and then be held accountable in advance for ‘future
offending’.
The third finding further indicates that this governance logic does not
reserve space for individual subjective judgment or moral
response. Whether it
is the determination of the particular behaviour or the assessment of the
presence of repentance and contrition,
provides answers through
institutional presupposition, excluding youth from the actual exercise of
Thus, through the institutional trajectory of ‘classification
presupposition – moral discipline’, the
continues the
social exclusion mechanisms it purports to dismantle; while reproducing harm to
targeted (colonised, racialised and
impoverished youth) groups within the
legitimising discourse of ‘protection’ and ‘care’. The
reason this
process is described as the ‘reproduction of harm’ is
precisely because it does not directly create new forms of oppression,
rather translates existing institutionalised governance pathways into new ways
of maintaining and justifying targeted criminalisation

‘offence’ is used here solely to mirror the language of the

way the statute constructs culpability in advance of judicial determination.
‘offence’ and ‘offender’ are cited directly from the
