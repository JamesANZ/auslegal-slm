Allegation of unlawful access and use of personal information [2006] NSWPrivCmr 4 (1 July 2006)
Allegation of unlawful access and use of personal
information
T, a teacher at a school, was travelling by car late one evening. The car in
which T was travelling nearly collided with another vehicle,
which was being
driven at high speed. The other vehicle then sped away. T, believing they
recognised the vehicle, followed it. When
the driver alighted from the other
vehicle, T recognised a student from their school.
T did not want to report the incident, as T felt it would have been unfair to
the student. T determined instead to contact the student’s
directly and tell them what had happened, in the hope that they would encourage
their child to drive more safely. On the
weekend, T attempted to locate the
student’s home number in the telephone book. It was not listed. T then
decided to drive
to the school and access the school computer records and find
the telephone number that way. T found the number and telephoned the
student’s parents on the weekend and told them about the incident.
The student’s parents were displeased amongst other things because they
had been contacted on the weekend and that T had accessed
their unlisted
telephone number from school records. One of the student’s parents
subsequently made a privacy complaint about
T having accessed school records
inappropriately.
provides for
the protection of personal information held by public sector agencies. T, as an
employee, may be covered by the Act.
Personal Information is defined in
of the Act as information or an opinion, whether or not recorded in a
material form, about an individual whose identity is apparent
or can reasonably
be ascertained from the information or opinion.
Section 4(3)(b)
provides that
personal information does not include information about an individual that is
available in a publicly available publication.
As a result of the complaint, the agency in question undertook an internal
review of the matter. The internal review looked at whether
the student’s
school records to access the student’s
telephone number, the number was
available in various local publications. For this reason it was held not to be
‘personal information’.
The internal review stated that, in the alternative, if the information was
considered to be ‘personal information’ for
the purposes of the Act
there would arguably still not be a breach of the Act, as when the student had
been enrolled at the school,
his parents had signed the enrolment form with a
‘Privacy Notice’ and this allowed personal information to be
for the purpose of ‘communication with students, parents’
and ‘for other matters relating to the welfare of a student’.
agency was of the view that the accessing of the student’s home telephone
number from the school records was directly related
to the welfare of the
student and to the duty of care that it owed to the student.
Agencies should be aware that in some circumstances the accessing of personal
information might not constitute a breach of the Act,
for example, where the
information is already publicly available. Members of the public, however, may
not be aware of these exceptions.
For this reason Privacy NSW recommends that
agencies ensure that their staff undertake privacy training and are made
familiar with
some of the more esoteric aspects of the NSW Privacy
legislation.
