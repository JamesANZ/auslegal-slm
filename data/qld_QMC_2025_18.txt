SOLICITORS:

Respondent in person
What is this Application about?
[1] Graham Rowley was convicted and fined
$287 for disobeying the speed limit by 7 kilometres per hour on 19 March
Following his conviction and sentence,
Mr Rowley applied to reopen the proceeding. This was after a full-day summary
trial where
he cross-examined police witnesses, gave full evidence and made
extensive submissions.
What is the background to this Application to
[2] Months before the hearing, Mr Rowley had initially sought to have
the matter transferred to Brisbane. That was unsuccessful.
[3] The hearing
was then delayed to allow Mr Rowley to submit a Right to Information application
to the Information Commissioner.
After the Commissioner decided not to release
documents, Mr Rowley requested a further adjournment to apply for a review of
the decision.
The Court granted Mr Rowley’s request to allow him to
properly prepare his defence.
Does this Application provide any ground to
reopen the proceeding?
[1] Unfortunately for Mr Rowley, nothing in his
application provides any ground to reopen the
proceeding.
This is because a proceeding will
not be reopened simply to allow a party to re-argue their case on existing or
additional evidence.
[2] The High Court
has noted that the resources for the resolution of disputes are in high demand
and serve the public as a whole,
not merely the parties to the
proceedings.
Finality in proceedings is highly
desirable, because any further action beyond the hearing can be costly and
unnecessarily burdensome
on the parties.
[3] In the busy and high-volume Magistrates Court jurisdiction, thousands of
applications and complaints are heard and determined
each year. To facilitate an
expeditious resolution of the application to reopen, the parties were therefore
directed to file their
evidence by affidavit.
Despite this, Mr Rowley said he does not consent to this matter being decided on
the papers.
[4] The Court may hear the
application by affidavit evidence.
Rowley’s affidavit evidence and other filed material do not provide any
grounds for reopening. Mr Rowley fully embraced
the opportunity to ventilate
these issues at the original hearing. Mr Rowley was given considerable latitude
both before and during
the hearing – despite objections from the
Prosecution.
[5] Mr Rowley did not articulate grounds to reopen. Instead, he
filed documents rearguing findings of fact and alleging deceit or
conduct by the Prosecution and one of its witnesses.
[6] An application to
reopen is not a rehearing on the merits. The purpose of reopening a summary
criminal proceeding is merely to
correct an error or omission apparent from the
terms of the earlier order or because of
It is not an opportunity to
reventilate issues already canvassed at a hearing and for which findings were
made. Nor is it an opportunity
to ‘second-guess’ those findings.
Findings were made based on the evidence. No adverse findings of credit were
There is no evidence of any intent to mislead. The trial was properly
[7] It is not a reopening ground to accept the evidence of a
Prosecution witness. It is not a reopening ground to accept the submissions
the Prosecution. Deceit is a serious allegation requiring commensurate
Here, it is a bare allegation. That
does not meet the high threshold.
[8] Mr Rowley had the opportunity to
cross-examine Prosecution witnesses and to adduce evidence at the hearing and
did so. He made
oral submissions at length. Allowing him more court time for a
groundless application to reopen takes away valuable court time from
worthy applications. That would be contrary to the efficient administration of
justice and the public interest in the
expeditious resolution of proceedings.
[9] Mr Rowley’s disagreement with the original findings on the
evidence is not a ground to reopen the proceeding.
[10] Mr Rowley has been
given a fair go. His application to reopen is dismissed.
