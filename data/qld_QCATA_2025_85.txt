APPEARANCES & REPRESENTATION
Respondent:
Mr M Maynard of counsel instructed by the Australian Government
REASONS FOR
Introduction
[1] On 1 May
2023 the applicant Chris Ingall (‘Ingall’), then resident at Elanora
on the Gold Coast, had a document to
deliver to the police prosecutions office
(‘the office’) in Brisbane. The deadline for its delivery was
variously identified
as ‘one or two
or ‘ten days or
or simply 2
[2] On May 1
Ingall engaged the respondent, Australia Post (‘the Post’), to
deliver a letter containing the said document
to the office. He sent it by
Express Post.
[3] It is common
ground that the letter in question was never duly
but was evidently lost
in the postal process.
[4] Apparently
the subject document was readily replaceable. Ingall replaced it, albeit less
quickly than he might have done. However,
after protracted inquiries about the
letter’s whereabouts, on the eve of the deadline, Ingall drove to Brisbane
the replacement in person. He disdained further resort to the
or to other couriers, or to
electronic means of communication. Thus adverse action by the police was
averted. The primary tribunal
found that this was not a reasonable or
compensable expenditure of time and money in the
circumstances.
October 2023 Ingall began these proceedings, alleging negligence and breach of
contract, and claiming compensation in the
amount of $6,835.53 including
[6] Subsequently
the amount claimed was amended and reduced to
respondent Post denied liability but made a without
offer of $100 with a
refund of postage paid,
accordance with its terms of
[8] The defence,
as first pleaded, relied upon the proposition that QCAT, not being a
‘court’, had no jurisdiction to
hear and determine this case against
a federal instrumentality. The logic supporting this argument need not be
pursued here, in view
of the Court of Appeal’s decision in
which is of
course binding upon this tribunal. The principal
that QCAT ranks as a court of the State by virtue of
section 164
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2009
(‘the Act’)
It may be added that QCAT may take over
certain matters from a court,
must give written reasons on
is not subject to
direction or control by any
and its adjudicating
members enjoy the same protection and immunity as a Supreme Court judge
performing judicial functions.
As a former Chief Justice of the High Court has observed, the concept of a
‘court’ is not set in stone, but is
Appropriately, counsel
for the respondent abandoned the jurisdictional challenge.
[9] In various
parts of the said terms and conditions it is specifically provided that they are
not intended to override the Australian
However, no issue arises on
this point.
[10] The primary
hearing took place on 17 July 2024. Confronted by the applicant’s claims
the adjudicator exclaimed, ‘It’s
a ridiculous claim ... it’s
so inflated it’s not even
However, these
candid comments did not inspire the popular plea of apparent bias.
[11] The reasons
for the primary judgment may be summarised as follows: (a) no breach of contract
or negligence has been established;
(b) if such default were established, almost
no compensable loss has been proved.
[12] On the
first point the adjudicator explained:
[Y]ou cannot infer negligence
just because something [adverse] has happened which ... may or may not have been
negligent, but ...
the simple fact that it happened does not prove that there is
negligence.
The applicant has the onus of showing negligence or absence of care. [I
accept that] in the context of millions of letters a year,
going through
airports, going through trucks, going through – all over the country,
there is a prospect – it is the nature
of postal services that some of
them will be lost.
... The mere
fact that they have lost the letter does not satisfy me that there has been
negligence.
[13] No adverse
inference based on
res ipsa loquitur
was drawn from the admitted fact of
loss, although the facts in this case seem less complex than those in the
unsuccessful appeal
O’Hara v Kmart Tyre &
Auto Service
[14] Understandably
the applicant tends to see his complaint microcosmically, but the tribunal
accepted the respondent’s submission
the loss of one item among millions
of others in the postal system did not amount to sufficient evidence to
discharge the applicant’s
onus of proof. The legal concept of negligence
displays a remarkable capacity for ‘mission creep’, but it has not
reached the stage where every person’s misfortune ensures a judgment
against any targeted third party with apparent capacity
[15] The Post
did not guarantee delivery. Clause 61B.1 of its statutory terms and conditions,
incorporated in the particular contract,
As set out in clause
7B Australia Post will exercise due care and skill in supplying its services.
However, the nature of postal services
is such that circumstances may impact on
the successful delivery of articles.
[16] On the
quantum of compensation the tribunal was succinct:
I am not giving
you any compensation for the fact that the document was lost by Australia Post
because it – the document had
no inherent value. It was easily replaced,
as you replaced it. The consequences of it not getting to its destination in
the ordinary
course of the post that you engaged – there was no
consequence except that you had to find a replacement for
In my view, [regarding] the losses that you associate with your loss of work
... you have provided no evidence other than your statement
that you lost work.
... You have not given me any details of what you lost. [Besides] ... in my
view, those losses are not reasonably
foreseeable. ... You chose to take the
document – a replacement document ... to the police personally. That is a
that you made. That is not necessarily something that you should be
compensated for because you took the decision. ... There were
alternatives.
You did not pursue those alternatives. You should not therefore then be
entitled to be compensated for your loss
of time in taking the document ... to
[17] Absence of
foreseeability of claimed losses was noted several times in the course of
At page 19 a highly
questionable claim for $1,568 ‘basically’ for phone calls was
discounted.
[18] The reasons
for decision are somewhat disjointed, partly because the applicant interrupted
and sought to argue with the adjudicator
while the reasons were being
Some of the
on matters of detail are somewhat difficult to reconcile. At one point the
adjudicator is reluctant to dismiss the application altogether:
feel right about just simply dismissing
correct answer to this, the jurisdictional question aside, is that Mr Ingalls is
entitled to compensation for the
cost of the service that was not

courts stress that judgments of busy and often overloaded tribunals are not to

respectful opinion, given the tribunal’s decisive dismissal of negligent
breach of contract and monetary heads of
claim, its reference to
‘compensation for the cost of the service’ points the way to a
non-fault solution to this dispute.
However, unfortunately for the applicant, it
leads to a purely nominal award in his favour. Hence, perhaps, the
adjudicator’s
regret at ‘just simply dismissing this’ and the
respondent’s
offer of $100. At law, as I see it, the
applicant’s only remaining course is to rely upon a form of action
implicit in several
of his complaints – namely an action for total failure
of consideration.
This action
sometimes supports large awards, but in the circumstances of this case, alas, it
promises very slim pickings indeed.
The Post has taken his money and given him
nothing for it. Therefore the Post must refund the cost of a service charged for
$7.91. To that limited extent the order for
dismissal of this application must be amended, and there will be an order
accordingly.

error of fact,
has resulted in serious
This matter turns
upon the primary tribunal’s findings of fact; fact-finding is its
prerogative,
and findings of
fact by a trial court are seldom disturbed on appeal. If there is evidence, or
if there are available inferences
which compete for the judge’s
acceptance, no error of law occurs simply because the judge prefers one version
of evidence to
another or one set of inferences to
Reasonable minds may
differ, but that is not a proper ground of appeal. It is not the function of a
tribunal of appeal to substitute
its own view for reasonable findings of a
primary judge, even if disposed to do so.
[21] Finality is
an important legal object,
particularly in lower courts where an interminable dispute can too easily result
in costs and inconvenience out of all proportion
to the interests involved.
[22] I discern
no reasonably appellable error in the decision under appeal. The application is
dismissed, subject to the foreshadowed
minor change in the order of 17 July
