INTRODUCTION
Panel, Bruce Cowley (sitting President), Marina Kelman and
Georgina Varley, declined to conduct proceedings on an application
NL in relation to its own affairs. The application concerned an alleged
association in the context of a requisitioned board
spill meeting. The Panel
considered that the applicant did not provide a sufficient body of material to
justify the Panel making
further enquiries and that there was no reasonable
prospect that it would declare the circumstances unacceptable.

21 October 2024, Emu announced that it had agreed to place up to 61 million
shares at $0.025 per share to sophisticated and professional
investors to raise
up to $1.525 million to fund exploration within its Georgetown project in
Queensland and for general working capital
). The Placement
was managed by MPS, of which Mr Barry Dawes is the sole Director and Principal,
and was to be effected in two tranches
with 21 million shares to be issued
forthwith under Emu’s placement
and the balance to be
issued subject to and upon shareholder approval being obtained at Emu’s
Annual General Meeting (

up for re-election
and that resolutions regarding his re-election and receipt of options had been

2 December 2024 announcement also included disclosure regarding board changes
which noted (among other things) that:
(a) Emu considered it was entering a very important new phase in its history
with developments at its Yataga Copper Project at Georgetown
where there had
been highly encouraging emerging evidence from the numerous geochemistry,
structural analyses and geophysical surveys

23 January 2025, Emu announced that it had received a notice under section
Requisition Notice
signed by Mayfair, Coolibah, Oakmount and Farris (together, the
Requisitioning Shareholders
) to consider resolutions to remove
Mr Thomas and Mr Bartsch as directors of Emu and to appoint Mr Keith Rowe
and Mr John Anderson
as directors.
23 January 2025 announcement included a notice of initial substantial holder on
behalf of the Requisitioning Shareholders and
others including Mr Rowe and Mr
Anderson disclosing a voting power of 8.89% and an association pursuant to
sections 12(2)(b) and
12(2)(c) by reason of the Requisition Notice.
11 February 2025, Emu released a notice of meeting in relation to the
Requisition Notice with the meeting (
Requisition Meeting
) to be held on
18 March 2025. The notice of meeting included:
(a) A statement that the Emu directors unanimously recommend shareholders vote
against all four resolutions, which noted (among other
things) that the
Requisitioning Shareholders have failed to advance a superior plan for Emu and
that their conduct is consistent
with an attempt to takeover Emu by stealth
rather than via a formal takeover.
(b) A statement from the Requisitioning Shareholders which noted (among other
things) that:
(i) the Requisitioning Shareholders collectively have extensive experience
across capital markets, property and mining
(ii) the recent AGM results are reflective of a loss of trust and growing
concern with the directors’ actions and decision
(iii) the Requisitioning Shareholders held concerns in relation to the
composition and independence of the board and its failure
to listen to
shareholders and
(iv) the key strategy under new leadership would include rationalizing the
current asset base, pursuing new opportunities with ‘projects
of size and
scale’ and introducing sufficient new capital to ensure Emu is funded to
explore and develop projects of significance.
11 March 2025, Emu announced an update in relation to its Yataga Copper Project
including that work carried out had indicated a
potential large scale copper
mineralised system.
12 March 2025, Emu released an Appendix 2A disclosing that it had issued
1,222,222 shares on that date “

appear to the board to be unacceptable, including those associated with [the

APPLICATION
application dated 3 April 2025, Emu sought a declaration of unacceptable
circumstances. Emu submitted (among other things) that:
(a) The Interested Persons are associates in relation to Emu and are acting in
concert with the intention of removing the majority
of the incumbent board and
replacing them with those who are sympathetic towards the alternate business
goals of the Interested Persons.
(b) A large proportion of the Interested Persons first became members, or
alternatively increased their holdings, in December 2024,
one month before the
Requisition Notice.
(c) The Interested Persons collectively hold
in Emu and have failed to
fully disclose their holdings to the market.
(d) The Interested Persons have:
(i) a common history as to time
(ii) a common history as to contact, all becoming
members through placements associated with Dawes and/or MPS and
(iii) a common history of voting, both at the AGM and more recently by the
lodgment of proxies.
(e) The manner in which the Interested Persons have exercised their voting power
at the AGM and by way of lodgement of proxies after
21 January 2025 and before
18 March 2025, the acquisitions by Interested Persons in December 2024 and
later, and the failure to comply
with section 671B, is unacceptable.
did not seek any interim orders.
sought final orders including to the following effect:
(a) imposing a voting restriction on the Interested Persons
(b) requiring the Interested Persons to dispose of Emu shares
(c) requiring the Interested Persons to make corrective disclosure to the market
(d) a costs order for Emu’s costs of the application.
have considered all the materials but address specifically only those we
consider necessary to explain our reasoning. We note
the following:
(a) Emu did not provide copies of certain documents referred to in its
application, including the Requisition Notice, the substantial
shareholder
notice of 23 January 2025 and the notice of meeting of 11 February 2025. These
materials were publicly available on
the ASX market announcements platform where
we were able to access them.
Nevertheless, failing to provide such material with the application did not
assist us and we remind parties that any document intended
for the Panel should
be accompanied by any relevant material including market
announcements.
(b) Mr Dawes and Mr
Grewar were not initially given a copy of the application by Emu. We considered
they were both an “interested
and decided to direct
that Emu give them a copy of the application. We invited Mr Dawes and Mr Grewar
to make a preliminary submission,
which they each did. As set out below, these
preliminary submissions, particularly that of Mr Dawes, provided considerable
information relating to the circumstances the subject of the
application. In the circumstances, we considered it was appropriate
Emu an opportunity to make submissions in response to Mr Dawes’ and Mr
Grewar’s preliminary submissions by way
of a preliminary question, which
(c) While each of the Interested Persons were given a copy of the application,
only three of the Interested Persons became parties
proceeding.
In addition to the
preliminary submissions of Mr Dawes and Mr Grewar, we also received a
preliminary submission from Mr Wills and
a short preliminary submission from
another Interested Person who did not become a party.
submitted that there had been an accumulation and exercise of voting power
demonstrative of a clear association between the Interested
and that the following events were not a mere
coincidence:
(a) based on a post-meeting analysis of the voting at its AGM, each of the
Interested Persons listed as recipients of shares under
the first tranche of the
Placement in paragraph
” both against the remuneration report and in
favour of the resulting board spill motion
(b) following the failure to carry the spill motion
at the AGM, the same persons proceeded to “
increase their holdings
and/or bring further person(s) into the cabal
” via the second tranche
of the Placement only one month before the issue of the Requisition Notice
(c) within a short time of the Requisition Notice being given, a very large
number of proxy votes were received by Emu and each Interested
Person has lodged
a proxy in favour of all resolutions proposed by the Requisition Notice.
further submitted that:
(a) before and after Mr Rutherford’s retirement, Mr Dawes had made a
number of approaches to Mr Thomas expressing the view
that Mr Grewar should be
elevated to the board and that Mr Dawes was “
Mr Bartsch’s appointment to the board and
(b) Mr Dawes had asked Mr Thomas how the voting and
proxies in relation to the Requisition Meeting were looking, to which Mr Thomas
” and in the days after this conversation a
flood of proxy votes in favour
” were received.
also submitted that the event which “crystallised” the need for the
application was Emu’s discovery on 16 March
substantial
breaches of duty
the apparent dissemination of Emu’s confidential
information
to one or more Interested Persons (including reports and
investigations into ongoing EMU operations which had not been made publicly
material which suggested that Mr
Grewar was known to and associated with a number of other persons, including
Barry Dawes, Vern Wills
and Ian McPherson [sic] - the latter of which were
associated with entities which either were, or would become, corporate members
of EMU, with a view to removing the incumbent board so that EMU could refocus
its operations on a copper and gold project in the
Philippines called
support of this submission, Emu provided with its application:
(a) a description of “background” information including (among other
things) that:
(i) in 2021, Emu carried out due diligence on Tolu Minerals Limited, of which Mr
Wills and Mr Anderson were “promoters”
at the time, and of which Mr
Anderson and Mr Macpherson are currently directors
(ii) Mr Dawes is listed as the Joint Lead Manager to Tolu Minerals
Limited’s ASX-listing of November 2023
(iii) for some time during late 2024 and into early 2025, the Emu board had been
concerned about Mr Grewar’s conduct noting
that he had denied the board
clearance to trade contending the market was not fully informed, but to the
board nothing appeared to
enliven the obligation to disclose and
(iv) a review of Mr Grewar’s email account revealed “
work done on the Mabuhay copper/gold project in the Philippines, not on account
” and Mr Grewar is the manager of a new venture incorporating
the Mabuhay project along with Mr Wills and Mr Macpherson.
(b) an email of 17 January 2024 from Mr Grewar to Mr Wills and Mr Macpherson
attaching a discussion paper relating to
[a] quick and dirty look at Potential. Based on facts, I
don’t think is [sic] out of the ballpark and plenty of upside to
(c) several emails between Mr Grewar and Mr Dawes from the period 23 February
2025 to 11 March 2025 relating to the Yataga Copper
Project including
photographs of rocks and the content of draft versions of Emu’s ASX
announcement of 11 March 2025.
also submitted that to the extent that it relies upon circumstances which
occurred more than 2 months ago, the Panel should exercise
its discretion to
extend time to hear the
application
including because
circumstances were “
kept hidden from EMU’s knowledge
for a period sufficient to allow the time limit to
Dawes submitted that MPS was mandated by Emu to raise new equity funds and
assist with establishing a stronger shareholder base
that would support the
considerable capital raisings required to progress with the Yataga Copper
Project. He also submitted that:
(a) placements were made to a range of “
shareholders
” who were introduced to the company and its prospects
(b) he was unaware of any MPS client voting at the AGM
had no idea the 249D was coming
(d) at the time of having the conversation with Mr Thomas referred to in

of the Requisition Meeting and advised
Mr Thomas that he would round up his clients to vote in favour of the existing
had not at that stage opened the proxy form letters and booklet in
relation to the Requisition Meeting
(e) there were deficiencies regarding the proxy form in relation to the
Requisition Meeting including because it did not provide
space for shareholders
to give their SRN or HIN and “
provided a leading action by highlighting
a crossing the Against column
(f) on requesting client identified proxy forms for a number of client
shareholders and his own shareholding, he found that these
had already been
pre-filled with voting “for” the current directors
(g) Emu paid the company it engaged to advise on the Requisition Meeting
A$30,000 + GST by way of the share issue on 12 March 2025
and those shares were
voted in favour of the current directors
(h) he considered that the “
use of EMU NL funds and the issue of shares
during the 249D period was not permitted and became quite angry and decided to
spoke to a number of clients who had
also seen the ploy and were equally concerned
(i) the proxy votes in favour of the Requisition Notice “
reflect the
dissatisfaction of shareholders with the Notice of Meeting Booklet which
appeared to be potentially misleading.
relation to Emu’s submission that Mr Dawes advocated for Mr Grewar’s
elevation to the board, Mr Dawes submitted that
he had no interest in changing
the control of the board and had “
only wished for a geologist familiar
with Queensland geology and porphyry copper geology in particular and based to
the east Coast
to be appointed
”. He also submitted that:
(a) he considered it was a poor strategy to have three or more non-executive
directors running an exploration company
(b) he had known Mr Grewar for about 20 years including through serving together
on the board of another company
(c) on numerous occasions he had indicated to Mr Thomas that his clients would
like to see a stronger board and
(d) it was “
clear that EMU NL might have a very significant deposit of
mineralisation and that the current Board with a terrible company performance
record would not be able to attract the large amount of capital required to
carry out the drilling program.
relation to Emu’s submission concerning contact between Mr Dawes and Mr
Grewar during the period 23 February 2025 to 11 March
2025, Mr Dawes submitted
As broker to the company and as a geologist I requested and
received technical information on this unique mineralisation to satisfy
(b) He requested photographs of rock and their assays in connection with the
preparation of a research note to his clients which
was published on 11 March
2025 after the release of Emu’s update on the Yataga Copper Project and
not circulated to any person
prior to that announcement.
Dawes also submitted that he had no knowledge of the Mabuhay project.
Grewar submitted (among other things) that:
(a) He was “
unaware of any 249D activity although [he] was hardly
surprised given increased conversations with shareholders relating to EMU
performance
over the past 2 years.
(b) He was not “
aligned with any shareholder or shareholders to
facilitate a 249D
(c) The ASX announcement of 11 March 2025 was very important for Emu and was
prepared to update the market of the geophysics results
from two programs
completed in late 2024.
(d) Mr Dawes had advised him in February 2025 that he wished to prepare a
newsletter for his clients and wanted to use photos of
rock samples in the
newsletter.
(e) Mr Grewar issued a draft ASX release to Mr Dawes and prepared some detail
to ensure his newsletter
would best market the project and align with the material information in the ASX
(f) Mr Wills and Mr Macpherson are “
known to [Mr Grewar] and have been
assisting [him] since September 2022 in trying to secure the Mabuhay Project for
private purposes
” in relation to which Mr Grewar requested and
received approval from Emu board members to
Wills submitted (among other things) that:
(a) he met Mr Grewar in December 2020 and had been asked by Mr Grewar if he was
interested in the Mabuhay project
(b) there was no proposal to use Emu as a vehicle for listing/hosting the
Mabuhay asset
(c) he became aware of Emu’s appointment of MPS in early 2024 and had
participated in Emu capital raisings through Wayburn
and had purchased 3.6
million shares (around 1.8%) and
(d) Emu had participated in designing proxy forms to disadvantage shareholders.
other preliminary submission we received was also critical of the process of
distribution of proxy forms in relation to the Requisition
its submissions in response to the preliminary question, Emu submitted (among
other things) that:
(a) Very large parts of both of Mr Dawes’ and Mr Grewar’s
preliminary submissions traverse factual matters which are
not germane to the
application and neither submission assists the Panel in its consideration of the
matter and it is open to the
Panel not to take them into account.
(b) Mr Grewar's submission is lacking in probative value and is readily seen as
self-serving given his recent termination of services
as the CEO of Emu.
(c) Mr Dawes' submission makes it plain that for his own reasons he did decide
to support the spill motion.
(d) It is incorrect of Mr Dawes to suggest that a blank (or otherwise not
pre-completed) proxy form was not provided, and the material
circulated by the
share registry makes it plain that any recipient of the document was able to
select for, abstain or against.

in considering
whether to conduct proceedings on the question of whether shareholders are
associated in the context of a board spill,
the Panel applies its
well-established principle that the applicant must demonstrate a sufficient body
of evidence of association
to convince the Panel as to that association, albeit
with proper inferences being
mentioned above, the Requisitioning Shareholders disclosed an association in
relation to Emu and collective voting power of 8.89%
in their substantial
holding notice disclosure of 23 January 2025. However, Emu asserts that the
association is much broader than
that disclosed and encompasses all of the
Interested Persons, such that the collective voting power is 31.86%. The Panel

applicant to demonstrate a sufficient body of probative material where it is

primarily relies on matches between the voting of Interested Persons at the AGM
and their proxy voting in relation to the Requisition
Meeting, along with
accumulations of shares having been made shortly before the Requisition Notice
via the Placement. As has been
observed by previous Panels, shareholders voting
in the same manner is usually not sufficient evidence to demonstrate an
association

regarding the exercise of voting

any communications or other circumstantial material supporting such an
understanding or agreement between the

had difficulty ascertaining from the application how Mr Dawes, Mr Grewar, Mr
Wills or Mr Macpherson fit in to the alleged association.
However, we take Emu
to be suggesting that the Interested Persons were connected through Mr Dawes in
(for example, as
“hub and spokes”
where Mr Dawes was the hub and each of the Interested Persons were the spokes,
or some other similar arrangement where Mr Dawes was
acting as a conduit between
the Interested Persons). Mr Dawes (via MPS) was engaged to manage the Placement
and was responsible
for sourcing investors to participate in the Placement. He
admitted in his submissions that he had discussions with placees following
release of the notice of meeting in relation to the Requisition Meeting
including regarding concerns about the proxy forms and the
share issue of 12
March 2025.
circumstances, we did not consider these discussions were likely to indicate an
association.
regard to the materials before us and noting the surrounding circumstances
including the two consecutive strikes on the remuneration
report, we were
inclined to the view that the voting matches reflected like-mindedness on the
part of the Interested Persons or collective
action conduct unlikely to
constitute acting as associates or entering into a relevant agreement giving
rise to a relevant interest.
also submitted that Mr Grewar and others were seeking to refocus Emu’s
operations on the Mabuhay project in the
Philippines.
