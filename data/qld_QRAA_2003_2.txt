A decision by the Stewards of

period of 6 weeks.
BREACH OF RULE
APPEARANCES
: Mr PJ Davis of Counsel instructed by
Hewlett & Company appeared on behalf of the Appellant.
Mr K Adams,
Steward appeared on behalf of the Respondent.
REASONS FOR AUTHORITY’S DECISION
Mr Leo G Williams AO - Chairman
The Hon Sir James Killen - Deputy
Mr Dennis Standfield - Member
This an appeal by
Mr Denis Holbeck against the decision of the Stewards of the Queensland Harness
Board to suspend his driver’s
licence for 6 weeks after finding that he
breached Rule 149(1) of the Rules of Harness Racing.
Rule 149(1)
“A driver shall take all reasonable and permissible measures
during the course of a race to ensure that the horse driven by
that driver is
given full opportunity to win or obtain the best possible position in the
This appeal at the request of the Appellant was heard
together with the appeal by Mrs Freda Georgina Mitchell who appealed against
finding by the Stewards that she breached Rule 240 of the Rules of Harness
At the outset the Authority advised that the appeal should be by
way of re-hearing and directed that the Respondent present first
its case on the
material presented at the Stewards inquiry against this Appellant and Mrs
A separate decision will be given by the Authority in relation
to Mrs Mitchell’s appeal but the factual background concerning
appeals will be referred to in this decision.
The Stewards inquiry
concerning the findings of breaches of Rules 149(1) and 240 were conducted over
four separate days and comprised
112 pages of transcript. The Authority found
the transcript and the manner in which the inquiry was conducted somewhat
and this was one of the reasons why the Authority directed that the
Respondent first present its case at the appeal.
The matter concerned
the driving tactics adopted by the Appellant during the running of the Ray
Hollis Patrons Christmas Cup being
race 5 held at the Redcliffe Paceway on
Friday 20 December 2002. The Appellant was the driver of Station Road which was
by Mrs Mitchell. On the night of the race Mrs Mitchell was in hospital
and had given authority that the Appellant was in charge
of the horse.
Station Road was the long shot in the race with odds of around 130 to 1.
The horse drew position six on the front line and from the
commencement of the
race Station Road was caught wide in the early stages for a distance of
approximately 600 metres. The Appellant
put pressure on the horse by urging the
horse with the whip and the horse was able to cross outside of Breathless
Mahoney which was
the leader in the race.
The Stewards state that when
it became obvious that Breathless Mahoney would not yield to give Station Road
the lead the Appellant
should not have continued the pressure and should have
given Station Road a “breather”.
The Stewards claim that
these actions by Mr Holbeck were a breach of Rule 149(1) and resulted in Station
Road fading in its run finishing
last 24 metres from the winner.
Stewards based their claims concerning the Appellant’s drive by referring
to previous runs by Station Road where it took
the death seat and also by the
sectional times run in the race. The lead time of 49.2 in the race was the
fastest lead time run for the distance at Redcliffe.
Holbeck claimed his racing tactics were justified as he was driven to the
trainer’s instructions who required him to keep
the horse “bowling
along”. Mr Holbeck also stated that he was satisfied with the run of the
horse and where it had finished.
The circumstances set out above are
not out of the ordinary, but this matter differs as it is clear from the inquiry
that the Stewards
were trying to ascertain whether the driving tactics were for
the purpose of disadvantaging Breathless Mahoney which was one of the
in the race.
After the finish of the race there was some comments made
when persons connected with the Committee of the Redcliffe Trotting Club
approached the Stewards’ room and indicated they wanted to lodge a
complaint. The complaint concerned the driving tactics
adopted by Mr Holbeck
and words were stated to the effect that the drive was a disgrace and as the
race was going throughout Australia
the Stewards should do something about it.
The Stewards responded by stating that they had already called Mr Holbeck to an
Also at the inquiry the Stewards endeavoured to ascertain
whether there were any links between the Appellant, Mrs Mitchell and other
persons. This was because the Stewards were enquiring into bets placed by a
professional punter on a horse in the race. The Appellant
and Mrs Mitchell
consistently and vehemently denied any wrong doing.
At the conclusion of
the matter the Stewards did not pursue the matter of any
“connection” with other parties. After
finding Mr Holbeck of a
breach of Rule 149(1) Mr R Cressey, the Chairman of the Stewards Panel stated
when imposing the penalty:
The Chairman: Mr Holbeck, in
relation to penalty, as we said earlier in the inquiry and throughout the
inquiry, we did look at this
matter seriously at the start.
were concerned at the way the horse was driven and whether the horse was being
run on its merits. However, we do believe there
was insufficient evidence to
sustain a charge under that rule, and we found you guilty obviously of
contravening 149(1), which relates
to allowing your horse to - giving it all
reasonable and permissible measures.
We believe the appropriate
penalty is a suspension of your driver’s licence for a period of 6 weeks.
After viewing the video of the race the Authority is of
the opinion that the continued pressure which Mr Holbeck put on the horse
endeavouring to keep it “bowling along” could only result in the
horse being unable to sustain that pace and fade
in its running. Admittedly Mr
Holbeck drove to the trainer’s instructions, but there must come a point
when an experienced
driver such as Mr Holbeck must realise the toll that will be
taken on a horse by continuing with those instructions, particularly
much effort was taken to gain the position outside of Breathless Mahoney during
the first 600 metres.
One of Mr Davis’s submissions was that as the
horse’s odds were 130 to 1, and there was nothing to suggest that any
driving tactics adopted would have resulted in it finishing anywhere other
than last and therefore there could not be a breach of
Rule 149(1). The
Authority does not agree with that submission and is of the opinion that it is
clear from the race video that to
give the horse full opportunity Mr Holbeck
should at some stage restrain the horse in its running.
In relation to
the matter of penalty the circumstances of the driver are not as severe as a
number of matters which have come to this
Authority for breaches of this Rule
and the Authority therefore reduces the suspension period to a period of 3
The appeal fee is forfeited.
