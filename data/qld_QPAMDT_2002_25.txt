PROPERTY AGENTS & MOTOR DEALERS TRIBUNAL
[2002] QPAMDT 25
DATE: 20 JUNE 2002
APPLICATION
NO: W023-02
APPLICANT: POTTER BARRY HOWARD
FIRST RESPONDENT: COOLAMON NOMINEES PTY LTD T/A RECLIFFE MOTOR
RESPONDENT: MASTERS CLIFFORD
RESPONDENT: MASTERS GLENDA
OF HEARING: 12 JUNE 2002
[2002] QPAMDT
REASONS FOR DECISION
This is an application by Barry Howard
Potter (“Applicant”) under section 119(1) of the
Auctioneers and
1971 ("the repealed Act") claiming against the former fund on the
basis of an alleged contravention of the repealed Act by Coolamon
Nominees Pty
Ltd t/a Redcliffe Motor Auctions.
The claim arises in relation to a 1994
Camry sedan Registration number 896 CTP which the Applicant gave to the First
Respondent on
consignment on 6 June 2001. The Applicant was advised on 18 June
2001 that the vehicle had been sold and that a cheque for $10,500
would be sent
to the Applicant.
On 20 June 2001 the First Respondent went
into receivership and subsequently into liquidation on 17 July 2001. The
Applicant has not
received payment from the First
Respondent.
The Applicant passed away on 22 September
2001 and his wife, Mrs Lalage Potter, as executor of his estate has continued
against the fund.
The Applicant claims compensation from
the former fund pursuant to s 119(1)(a) in the amount of
$10,500.00.
The transfer of the claim to the Tribunal
The claim by the Applicants has become a
claim against the claim fund under the
Property Agents and Motor Dealers
2000 (“the Act”) by virtue of section 604 of the Act which
Former fund
and liabilities of the former fund are taken to be the rights and liabilities of
the claim fund.
A claim that has been made against the former
fund, and not finished before the commencement, continues as if it were a claim
the claim fund.
(3) If, before the commencement, a person could
have made a claim against the former fund but did not make the claim, the person
make the claim against the claim fund.
The application was made after the
commencement of the Act but is a claim against the former fund as stated in s
604(3) of the Act.
The application is made for compensation due to the
fraudulent misapplication or misappropriation of the funds received on the sale
of the vehicle. As this application could have been made against the former fund
it is now a claim against the claim fund established
under the Act.
At a directions hearing held on 2 May
2002 an order was made for the Mr Glenda Masters, a director of the First
Respondent, to be
joined as the Third Respondent to these
proceedings.
The Applicant and Second and Third
Respondents attended the hearing in person. The parties did not have legal
representation.
The Tribunal was satisfied that the
requirements of section 474 and 475 of the Act had been
While the Tribunal is to deal with this
application under the Act it is to determine the claim based on section 119 of
the repealed
Act which relevantly provided as
Application of fund
A&A Act 119.(1)
Subject to this Act, the fund shall be held and applied for the purpose of
reimbursing persons who may suffer pecuniary loss because
the contravention of any provision of
section 60,69, 70, 72, 73 or 74 of part 7, division 1 by a prescribed person; or
the stealing or fraudulent
misappropriation or misapplication by a prescribed person of money or other
valuable property entrusted
to the prescribed person in the course of the
business of a licensee as an auctioneer, real estate agents, commercial agent or
“prescribed person”
means a licensee, the licensee’s partner, employee, agent or any
person having the apparent charge or control for the time being
of the office or
business of the licensee.(s.119)
A person may claim
against the fund by giving the registrar written notice of the substance of the
The notice must be given within—
(a) 6 months
after the person becomes aware that the person has suffered pecuniary loss;
(b) 3 years after the commission of the breach that caused the
person’s pecuniary loss;
whichever occurs sooner.
determining the amount of any claim the Tribunal may also need to consider
sub-sections 120(2) and (7) of the repealed Act
which provided as
Claims against the fund
A&A Act 120.(1)
No person shall be entitled to recover from the fund an
amount greater than the balance of the loss suffered by the person after
from the total amount of such loss the amount or value of all money or
other benefits received or recovered or which in the opinion
of the committee
might, but for the person’s neglect or default, have been received or
recovered by the person from any source
other than the fund in reduction of such
No amount shall be paid or be payable out of
the fund as interest on the amount of any judgment obtained or of any claim
allowed against
13. The process for deciding a claim against
the fund is that set out in section 488 of the Act which provides as
Deciding claims other than minor claims
The Tribunal may allow the claim, wholly or partly, or reject the
However, the Tribunal may allow the claim only if
satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that—
(a) an event
mentioned in section 470(1) happened; and
(b) the claimant suffered financial
loss because of the happening of the event.
If the Tribunal allows
the claim, wholly or partly, the Tribunal must—
(a) take into account
any amount the claimant might reasonably have received or recovered if not for
the claimant’s neglect
or default;
(b) decide the amount of the
claimant’s financial loss; and
(c) name the person who is liable for
the claimant’s financial loss.
14. As this is a claim for a
contravention of the repealed Act, sub-section 119(1) of the repealed Act rather
than sub-section 470(1)
of the Act applies.
The evidence
15. The Applicant lodged a claim for $10,500.00 dated 29 June 2001 which was
received on 2 July 2001 by the Registry in which the
claim is detailed.
Accompanying this claim was a statutory declaration detailing the substance of
16. On 22 September 2001 the Applicant passed away.
17. On 14 December 2001, the liquidators for the First Respondent lodged a
response to the claim.
18. Following a directions hearing on 2 May 2002, the Applicant lodged a
further statutory declaration by Nova Marjorie McDonald,
the Applicant’s
19. A copy of the signed will of the Applicant was presented to the Tribunal.
The will provided for Mrs Lalage Potter to be the executor
Applicant’s estate.
20. The Applicant took the vehicle to the First Respondent’s premises
on 6 June 2002. The respondent spoke with a salesperson
and agreed that the car
could be sold at auction for $11,500.00. It was further agreed that if the
vehicle was to be sold for less
that this amount, further documentation would
need to be signed.
21. On 18 June 2001, the applicant was advised by phone that the vehicle had
been sold to a dealer and a cheque for $10,500.00 would
be sent to him the
following Monday.
22. No written evidence of the consignment was provided to the Tribunal but
the registration history (attached to the investigator’s
report) evidenced
the transfer from the Applicant to the First Respondent to the buyer. The
Tribunal accepts this as evidence of
the transaction.
23. On 20 June 2001 the First Respondent went into receivership. Clout &
Associates were appointed the receivers.
24. On 17 July 2001 the First Respondent went into liquidation.
25. The Applicant confirmed at the hearing that payment had not been received
from the First Respondent.
Has a contravention of the repealed Act been committed?
26. Section 119(1)(d) provides:
Application of fund
Act 119.(1)
Subject to this Act, the fund shall be held and applied for the
purpose of reimbursing persons who may suffer pecuniary loss because
the stealing or fraudulent
misappropriation or misapplication by a prescribed person of money or other
valuable property entrusted
to the prescribed person in the course of the
business of a licensee as an auctioneer, real estate agents, commercial agent or
27. The difference between stealing and
fraudulent misappropriation was recently considered by the Victorian Court of
Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth) Reference No. 1 of
(12 September 1997) where Winneke, P. at page 10 said:
offence of larceny at common law, that is “stealing”, involved a
felonious or trespassory taking of property capable
of being stolen together
with an intent at the time of the taking to permanently deprive the true owner
of his property.
28. His Honour went on to distinguish larceny or
stealing from fraudulent misappropriation at page 15 where he
Larceny, as I have already said, involved a felonious taking and
carrying away of property without the consent of the owner with an
intention to
permanently deprive, whereas fraudulent misappropriation involved the dishonest
misapplication of property entrusted
to an accused and/or for which he was
obliged to account in circumstances which did not amount to a
29. Brooking J.A. in the same case considered the meaning of
the word “fraudulently” and, at page 27, said:
I should say
that it must be accepted that the word “fraudulently”, where twice
used in s.71(1), means dishonestly:
R. v. Smart
[1983] VicRp 22
(1983) 1 V.R. 265

R. v. Lawrence
(1997) 1 V.R.
R. v. Peters
(1996) 88 A.Crim.R. 525.
30. On the basis of the
evidence presented to the Tribunal, the Tribunal found that the Applicant
consigned the vehicle to the First
Respondent and that the First Respondent sold
the vehicle at auction prior to 18 June 2001. At the hearing, it was not
disputed that
the First Respondent received the sum of $11,500 from the sale of
the vehicle and that the First Respondent failed to account for
31. Gibbs J., in Stephens v. The Queen
[1978] HCA 35
(1978) 139 CLR 315
referred to Professor Smith, in an article "The Scope of Fraudulent Conversion",
(1961) Crim. Law Review 797, at p. 800, suggests
the following test where the
ownership in money is transferred:
"Was the transferee permitted, under
the terms of the contract, to use
the money as he thought fit; or was he
obliged to apply it in a particular way or to retain an equivalent sum, either
in his possession
or in a bank? Only in the latter event can the transferee
commit fraudulent conversion." This seems to me a satisfactory practical
apply. (at p334)
32. As the vehicle was consigned to the First
Respondent for sale, the First Respondent was obliged to retain the proceeds of
or an equivalent sum, either in its possession or in a bank for payment to
the Applicant. Applying the test in Stephens v The Queen,
it is clear that the
moneys were applied to the First Respondent's own use and benefit and that the
First Respondent was fraudulent
in so applying the moneys.
basis of this evidence the Tribunal finds that the First Respondent has
fraudulently misappropriated the proceeds of the
sale of the vehicle and that
the Applicant has suffered financial loss because of the happening of that
The amount of the financial
34. The Tribunal finds that the amount of that financial
loss was $10,500 – comprised of $11,500 received upon the sale of the
vehicle less the agreed commission.
35. On the basis of the evidence, it
is ordered that the Chief Executive of the Department of Tourism, Racing and
Fair Trading pay
from the claim fund to the Applicant the sum of
$10,500.00.
Reimbursement of the Fund
Tribunal finds, on the basis of the evidence outlined above, that the First
Respondent is liable for the Applicant’s
financial loss.
this case the claim will be paid out of the claim fund by virtue of section
604(2) of the act but this amount can be recovered
by virtue of section 604(1)
of the Act which states as follows:
The rights and liabilities of the former
fund are taken to be the rights and liabilities of the claim
This allows the Chief Executive to recover monies paid
out of claim fund as a liability of the former fund under the provisions of
38. The Tribunal must also consider the liability of the Second and
Third Respondents, if any, and in this regard it must consider
section 125 of
the repealed Act.
39. Under section 125 of the repealed Act, the
directors of the corporation, at the time when the act that gave rise to the
occurred, shall be jointly and severally liable to compensate the fund in
respect of that payment. The Tribunal finds that this section
applies to the
Second and Third Respondents.
40. The rights of the former fund to
recover from the Second and Third Respondents are taken to be the rights of the
claim fund by
virtue of section 604(1) of the Act. The fact that the former fund
no longer exists is irrelevant.
41. The monies are paid out of the claim
fund as if it were a claim against the claim fund and the claim fund, therefore,
can recover
this amount by virtue of that section acting under the provisions of
42. On the basis of the evidence, and applying section125 of
the repealed Act, the Tribunal finds that the First, Second and Third
Respondents are jointly and severally liable to compensate the claim fund in the
amount of $10,500.00.
43. The orders the Tribunal may make on a claim hearing are set-out in
section 530 of the Act which provides as follows:
Orders Tribunal may make on claim hearing
Tribunal may make the following orders in relation to a claim against the
(a) an order allowing the claim, wholly or partly, or rejecting
(b) an order stating that a named person is liable for a
claimant’s financial loss and the amount of the loss;
(c) an order
(d) an order that
no amount is recoverable in relation to a claim.
44. In accordance with s 530 of the Act the Tribunal orders:
that the Chief Executive of the
Department of Tourism, Racing and Fair Trading pay from the claim fund to the
Applicant the sum of
ten thousand five hundred dollars ($10,500.00);
that the First, Second and Third
Respondents reimburse the claim fund in the sum of ten thousand five hundred
dollars ($10,500.00)
in accordance with ss 490 and 491 of the
