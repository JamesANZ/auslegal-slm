OF MINES v MATOVINOVIC
[2018] SAWC
Judgment of
Senior Warden Dr Cannon

PURPOSES - GENERALLY
DIRECTOR OF
MINES v MATOVINOVIC
[2018] SAWC
claimholder had a partnership arrangement. It was to be 50/50. The other
partner was doing the actual work and drilling and
the other partner put his
address on the notice of pegging. The department went out and inspected after
the statutory holiday and
found no arms on the southeast peg, registration
number not properly recorded, and the northeast peg was down – there are
that show that.
sent a rectification letter to the address given on the notice of pegging and,
of course, it went to the partner, not to the
claim holder Mr Matovinovic.
did not come to the claimholders attention and so he did not immediately respond
but by chance he found out about the problem and
he has now attended and the
department agrees that he has rectified the problem with the pegs.
is clearly a breach of the regulations in a material respect. As to whether it
is of sufficient gravity, I respect the claimholder’s
intention to
surrender the claim. He does not want the ‘black mark’ of having an
order for forfeiture against him, and
having learnt from this experience as a
relatively novice miner, I accept his undertaking that he will surrender this
decline to forfeit it.
I find it is not of sufficient gravity and I rely on your undertaking that you
will surrender the claim within 21 days and so
you keep the claim but on that
understanding that it will not be there in 21 days’ time. You pull the
pegs, you tell the department
the next time.
