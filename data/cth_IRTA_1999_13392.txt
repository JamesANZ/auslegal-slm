DECISION: The Tribunal affirms the decision under review that the Applicant be
refused the grant of a Class 816 (special (permanent))
entry permit and a Class
818 (highly skilled on-shore (permanent) entry permit).
THE APPLICATION
On 10 July 1996 LN (the Applicant) applied to this Tribunal for review of a
decision to refuse to grant him a Class 816 (special
(permanent)) entry permit.
His application for the entry permit was lodged with the then Department of
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs
(the Department) on 21 April 1994, and was
refused on 7 February 1996. That decision was affirmed by the Migration
Internal Review
Office (MIRO) on 7 June 1996.
The Applicant has applied for a determination of refugee status. This Tribunal
determines that it is in the public interest to restrict
the publication of the
Applicant's name and details that could be used to identify him.
LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS
As a result of the
Migration Reform Act 1992
Migration Reform
(Transitional Provisions) Regulations
which accompanied that Act, the
application in this case is to be decided according to the criteria that
applied to the entry permit
for which application was originally made, which
are found in the Migration (1993) Regulations (the Regulations).
The criteria for a Class 816 entry permit are set out in Part 816 of Schedule 2
of the Regulations. They provide so far as is relevant
to this application:
816.72 Criteria to be satisfied at time of application (entry permit - after
816.721(1) The applicant is:
(a) a person who:
(i) had not turned 45 before 1 November 1993; and
(ii) meets the requirements of subclause (2) or (3); and
(iii) meets the requirements of subclause (4) or (6); or
(2) An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if, on 1 November
(b) the applicant:
(i) held an overseas technical qualification or general academic qualification
that is assessed by NOOSR as being comparable to an
Australian associate
diploma, diploma, degree, or higher degree; or
(ii) held an overseas trade qualification, or had work experience, that is
assessed as meeting Australian education or training standards
for that trade:
(A) by the Department of Industrial Relations; or
(B) if that Department is unable to make an assessment, by the State or
Territory authority that the Minister decides is appropriate;
(C) if neither that Department nor that State or Territory authority is able to
make an assessment, by the Minister;
(c) the applicant:
(i) had been enrolled during the 1993 academic year in an accredited course
leading to a trade certificate, advanced certificate,
associate diploma,
diploma, degree or higher degree; and
(ii) had met the academic progress requirements of the institution at which he
or she was enrolled.
(4) An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if:
(a) the applicant applied in accordance with subclause (5) for a determination
that the applicant was a refugee (whether or not the
application has been
withdrawn, and whether or not the application, if not withdrawn, has been
decided, and whether or not the decision,
if made, was adverse to the
applicant) ...
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (4)(a), an application for a determination
that the applicant is a refugee:
(a) must have been recorded by Immigration as having been received by
Immigration on or before 1 November 1993; and
(b) if the application was recorded by Immigration as having been received on
or after 1 February 1993 - must have been made on the
approved form.
816.722(1) If the applicant is a principal person, he or she is in Australia
816.723 If the applicant is a principal person, on 1 November 1993 he or she
either was in Australia or was the holder of a return
816.724(1) ... if the applicant is a principal applicant, he or she:
(a) was granted a visa (of any class) overseas on or before 12 March 1992; and
(b) used that visa to travel to, and enter, Australia on or before 1 November
The application under review was also for a Class 818 entry permit, the
criteria for which are set out in Part 818 of Schedule 2
of the Regulations
(the Schedule). The Tribunal does not propose to set out those criteria here
as it has not been argued by the
Applicant that he is able to satisfy them.
The Tribunal has before it the relevant Departmental file and also received
further information and written submissions from and
on behalf of the
Applicant. The Applicant attended a hearing of this matter on 9 July 1997.
Material on the Departmental file and the evidence records that:
* The Applicant was born on 11 July 1956 and he is married with 2 children. A
brother resides in Australia and his other brothers
live overseas. He
completed his schooling overseas.
* In 1980 the Applicant was awarded a certificate as an electrician after
completing a three year course in this field.
* He came to Australia as a visitor with his family on 16 June 1991 and was
granted permission to remain here until 17 September
1991. The visa had been
issued in Belgrade on 26 February 1991. In Australia his permission to remain
here was extended until 16
December 1991. He was granted a Processing Entry
Permit (PEP) on 28 July 1994.
* Correspondence passed between the Department, the Applicant and his legal
advisers, including a letter to the Applicant's advisers
for him to be assessed
by the Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) as required by the
Regulations.
* On 26 January 1996 DIR advised the Applicant was not eligible for recognition
as a trade person in Australia by it.
* The advice by DIR on 26 January 1996 was clarified by DIR on 6 February
* The Applicant's application was refused by the Department on 7 February 1996.
The Applicant did not satisfy clauses 816.721(2)
or (3) of the Regulations and
was also not eligible for the grant of a Class 818 entry permit. The decision
included the Applicant's
wife and children.
* On 14 March 1996 an application was made to MIRO to review the decision not
to grant him the entry permit applied for.
* MIRO affirmed the decision on 7 June 1996.
* The Tribunal arranged for the Applicant to have his qualifications and work
experience assessed by DIR again. On 15 May 1998 the
Tribunal was advised that
the Applicant was unable to satisfy the Australian standards or requirements as
"electrical fitter"
. The Applicant had been interviewed and had sat
the trade test.
* Further correspondence passed. On 12 August 1998 the Tribunal was advised
that the Applicant was unable to satisfy the Australian
standards or
requirements for the trade of an
"electrician"
* It was requested that the Applicant attempt another DIR test regarding his
qualifications or work experience. On 23 November 1998
the Tribunal advised
the Applicant's legal adviser's that the Applicant had been unable to
demonstrate that as at 1 November 1993
"held an overseas trade
qualification, or had work experience, that is assessed as meeting Australian
education or training standard"
for his stated trade as evidenced by the
DIR assessments.
* the Applicant has not completed any studies in Australia and was not enrolled
in a tertiary or other post secondary course as at
1 November 1993; and
* the Determination of Refugee Status (DORS) Secretariat of the Department
records state that the Applicant made an application for
refugee status on 2
December 1991.
* in his application form he stated that he was not employed nor was he engaged
in his own business.
As noted earlier on 23 November 1998 the Tribunal wrote to the Applicant's
advisers regarding his application before it, indicating
in part that it would
make a decision in this matter if nothing further was heard from him by after
14 days of the date of the letter.
The Applicant has made no further contact
with the Tribunal.
From the evidence and material before it, the Tribunal finds that the Applicant
had not turned 45 before 1 November 1993, and therefore
satisfies clause
816.721(1)(a)(i) of the Regulations.
The Applicant's application for a determination that he was a refugee was
recorded by the Department as having been received before
1 November 1993. He
thus satisfies clause 816.721(4)(a) of the Regulations.
The Tribunal also finds that the Applicant was granted a visa outside Australia
before 12 March 1992 and used that visa to travel
to and enter Australia before
1 November 1993. He was in Australia on 1 November 1993 and has remained in
Australia since that time.
He therefore satisfies clauses 816.722, 816.723 and
816.724 of the Regulations.
For the Applicant to satisfy clause 816.721 he must meet the requirements of
subclause (2) or (3) of that clause. Those provisions
are set out in full
above. The evidence before the Tribunal on these matters is that the Applicant
does not have any academic qualification
which would satisfy the requirements
of clause 816.721(2), or that he had any relevant business interest for the
purposes of subclause
(3). His case to the Tribunal has been that he meets
subclause 816.721 (2)(b)(ii), which requires a favourable assessment of the
Applicant's trade qualifications or work experience assessed by the
Commonwealth Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) or an appropriate
As indicated above, DIR's assessments of the Applicant's qualifications and
work experience is that he does not meet the requirements
for trade recognition
in Australia. As there is no other evidence of a favourable assessment of the
Applicant's trade qualifications,
the Tribunal finds that clause 816.721(2) is
not satisfied, and that the Applicant is therefore unable to satisfy the
criteria for
the grant of a Class 816 entry permit.
It may be that the Applicant's application fails for other reasons as well,
however given the above findings it is not necessary
to consider this further.
Nevertheless the Tribunal notes that there is no evidence before it to indicate
that the Applicant satisfies
the English language requirements referred to in
clause 816.732 of the Regulations.
To satisfy the requirements for a Class 818 entry permit, the Applicant must
demonstrate that he has obtained a bachelor's degree
or postgraduate
qualification in Australia prior to 1 November 1993 or was enrolled in a degree
course during the 1993 academic year.
As the evidence is that the Applicant
has not enrolled in or completed any such qualification in Australia, the
Tribunal finds that
he is unable to satisfy the criteria necessary for the
grant of a Class 818 visa.
The Tribunal affirms the decision under review that the Applicant be refused
the grant of a Class 816 (special (permanent)) entry
