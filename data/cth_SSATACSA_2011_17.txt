DATE OF DESPATCH:
18 July 2011
REASONS FOR DECISION
Christopher Davies is the parent liable to pay child support to Ms Anna White
for their child, Kim (born 2009).
Previous assessments
child support liability was registered with the Child Support Agency on 6 August
2009. Mr Davies was assessed to pay child support
as follows:
For the period 6
August 2009 to 17 January 2010, $5,093 per annum based on an income of $49,000
(his 2009 taxable income) and Ms White’s
estimated income of $14,991.
For the period
18 January 2010 to 5 November 2011, $356 per annum based on his estimated income
of $20,857 and Ms White’s estimated
income of $14,991.
5 February 2010, Ms White applied for an increase in the assessment based on
Reason 8 in relation to Mr Davies’ income, earning
capacity and financial
resources. Mr Davies also lodged an application requesting that the annual rate
for the period 6 August 2009
to 17 January 2010 be decreased to $1,138.
25 March 2010, Senior Case Officer found that Reason 8 was established in
respect of Mr Davies’ income and financial resources
and made a change of
assessment decision which set Mr Davies’ adjusted taxable income at
$49,000 for the period 18 January
2010 to 31 March 2012.
Davies subsequently objected to the decision and on 21 June 2010, an Objections
Officer decided to disallow Mr Davies’ objection.
On 2 July 2010, Mr
Davies lodged an application for review of the Objections Officer’s
decision with this Tribunal.
21 October 2010, this Tribunal (differently constituted) decided to set aside
the Objections Officer’s decision and substitute
a new decision that for
the period 18 January 2010 to 31 March 2012, Mr Davies’ adjusted taxable
income is set at $46,000.
This resulted in an annual rate of child support of
Present assessment
6 December 2010, Mr Davies made an application for a change of assessment on the
basis of Reason 8 in respect of the period 6 August
2009 to 17 January 2010. Mr
Davies requested that his adjusted taxable income for that period be set at
$46,000. Mr Davies argued
that, as the Tribunal had determined his taxable
income to be $46,000 for the 2009/2010 financial year, that amount should apply
to the whole financial year.
10 December 2010, a Senior Case Officer decided not to change the assessment
because no reason could be established. The Senior
Case Officer observed that Mr
Davies had not presented any new circumstances or information which had not
already been considered.
Mr Davies’ application was refused under
Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989
4 January 2011, Mr Davies lodged an objection to the Senior Case Officer’s
24 February 2011, an Objections Officer reconsidered the matter and decided to
disallow the objection. The Objections Officer considered
that no reason had
been established for there to be a change of assessment and refused the
application under
section 98F.
24 March 2011, Mr Davies lodged an application with the Tribunal for a review of
the Objections Officer’s decision.
Documents considered by the Tribunal
to the hearing the Tribunal received the following documents:
Support Agency sent documents to the Tribunal and to the other parties to the
application for review. The documents were
marked as folios 1 to 113.
In response to
directions issued by the Tribunal, Mr Davies provided documents which the
Tribunal marked as folios A1 to A110 and
sent copies to all the parties.
In response to
directions issued by the Tribunal, Ms White provided documents which the
Tribunal marked as folios B1 to B9 and sent
copies to all the parties.
CONSIDERATION
The legislative framework and issues for the Tribunal to determine
rate of child support payable by liable parent is usually based on an
administrative assessment under
Child Support (Assessment) Act
(the Assessment Act). This requires the application of a statutory formula
which takes into account factors such as the number of
children, the level of
care provided and the income of each parent.
liable parent or a carer may apply to the Child Support Registrar for a
determination to depart from the child support administrative
assessment under
Part 6A of the Assessment Act (section 98B). Where an administrative assessment
has been amended to give effect
to a previous departure determination, it
becomes the administrative assessment for all purposes, including a subsequent
application
for a departure determination.
98C provides that the Child Support Agency may decide to change the assessment
and establishes a three step process. The Child
Support Agency must be
(i) that one, or more than one, of the grounds for
departure referred to in subsection 117 (2) exists; and
(ii) that it would be:
(A) just and equitable as regards the child, the liable parent, and the
carer entitled to child support; and
(B) otherwise proper;
to make a particular determination under this Part....
are ten grounds for change of assessment of child support set out in section
117(2) of the Act. The Child Support Agency refers
to them as Reasons 1 to 10.
Child Support Agency must make one of the determinations in section 98S of the
Act if it is satisfied that there is a reason to
change the assessment and that
it would be just and equitable and otherwise proper to make a particular
determination. The determinations
in section 98S include varying the child
support income or adjusted taxable income of a parent.
dealing with Mr Davies’ application for review, the Tribunal stands in the
place of the Child Support Agency and must make
a decision on Mr Davies’
change of assessment application in accordance with this three step decision
making process.
98F provides that the Child Support Agency may refuse to make a change of
assessment where it is satisfied that there are
no grounds for doing so; i.e. no
grounds under section 117(2). However, it should be noted that section 98J
provides that a person
is not precluded from making a further application for a
change of assessment should their circumstances change.
Is there a reason to change the assessment?
Relevant law, evidence and contentions – Reason 8
this case, Mr Davies applied for a change of assessment for the period 6 August
2009 to 17 January 2010, on the grounds that the
rate of child support is unjust
and inequitable because of his income, property and financial resources. This is
referred to by the
Child Support Agency as Reason 8.
8 is the ground in section 117(2)(c)(ia) and (ib):
(c) that, in
special circumstances of the case
, application in relation to the
child of the
of this Act relating to administrative assessment of child support would result
an unjust and inequitable determination of the level of financial
support to be provided by
liable parent for the child:
because of the income, property and financial resources of either parent; or
because of the earning capacity of either parent;
term “special circumstances” is not defined in the Act. However, in
Gyselman v Gyselman
[1991] FamCA 93
[1992] FLC 92-279
, the Full Family Court indicated something
must be special or out of the ordinary in the particular case for there to be
circumstances.
Evidence and submissions
Davies said that he wanted his adjusted taxable income of $46,000 (as determined
by the Tribunal on 21 October 2010) to be applied
to the period 6 August 2009 to
17 January 2010.
Tribunal stated that the previous decision had not set his adjusted taxable
income at $46,000 for the 2009/2010 financial year.
Instead, it had taken the 18
January 2010 as an appropriate start date because it marked the most recent
administrative assessment
arising from his income estimate of $20,857 on that
Davies said that he felt the earlier Tribunal decision showed that his
circumstances had been properly considered. The Tribunal
observed that the both
the Senior Case Officer and Objections Officer in this case had determined that
his circumstances had not
changed so Reason 8 had not been established. Mr
Davies then stated that his circumstances have remained unchanged for the whole
time to which the assessment relates and implied that it would be consistent if
the adjusted taxable income of $46,000 were to apply
across the 2009/2010
financial year.
Tribunal pointed out that the previous Tribunal decision had compared the income
estimate of $20,857 which he gave to the Child
Support Agency on 18 January 2010
with his 2009 taxable income of $49,000 for the period 6 August 2009 to 17
January 2010. Accordingly,
this Tribunal would be undertaking a similar exercise
in deciding whether an adjusted taxable income of $46,000 would be appropriate
for that period.
Davies referred the Tribunal to folios A22 and A23 of the additional material
which comprised discussion by the Tribunal in the
previous case regarding Mr
Davies’ earnings via a trust and stated that the figures were accurate.
White told the Tribunal that there was really not much for her to say. She
relied on the documents before the Tribunal and considers
that the assessment
for the period 6 August 2009 to 17 January 2010 should not be changed. She said
that it is a question of how
the law will apply.
Assessment of evidence, findings of fact and application of the law
light of the evidence given by both Mr Davies and Ms White the Tribunal was
satisfied that there had been no change in the circumstances
of either of them
that would give rise to special circumstances in this case in the period 6
August 2009 to 17 January 2010. Essentially,
Mr Davies has sought to appeal from
the previous decision made by this Tribunal (differently constituted) when the
appropriate course
is to exercise his right of appeal against that decision in
the Federal Magistrates Court.
Tribunal was also satisfied that neither Mr Davies nor Ms White has any income,
earning capacity or financial resources which
are greater than stated in the
previous decision made by the Tribunal (differently constituted). Accordingly, a
ground under section
117(2)(c)(ia) or section 117(2)(c)(ib) was not established.
the Tribunal concluded that there were no special circumstances to justify a
change in the assessment as sought by Mr Davies.
Accordingly,
it was not necessary for the Tribunal to consider whether it would be just and
equitable to change the assessment or
whether it is “otherwise
proper” to change the assessment.
Consequently,
the application is refused under section 98F of the Assessment Act because no
reason could be established.
DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL
On 6 July 2011, the Tribunal decided to affirm the decision under review.
This means that the application for review has been unsuccessful.
