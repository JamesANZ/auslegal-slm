Name, address, and reference

of legal practitioner:
Charge referred by: Law
Institute of Victoria Limited
reference: VLR/03/1162
Name and address of complainant: Mr Ronald
On behalf of Carol Elizabeth Farrell.
CONCERNING A CHARGE
brought before the Tribunal by Law Institute of Victoria Limited against
Alan Brian Paul Stapleton (“the legal practitioner”)
in respect of a
complaint made by Mr Ronald Waugh on behalf of Carol Elizabeth Farrell
(“the complainant”).
REASONS OF LEGAL PROFESSION TRIBUNAL FOR DECISION GIVEN ON
17 MAY 2005
(Section 409 Legal Practice Act)
Mr. Stapleton was charged first with misconduct, or alternatively with
unsatisfactory conduct, in that he failed to provide to his
client a concise
written statement as to costs, in contravention of section 86 of the
Practice Act 1996
(“the first charge”). The charge of
misconduct was withdrawn by counsel for the Law Institute on the basis that some
information had been provided to the client pursuant to section 86, although not
the required information about costs. Counsel for
Mr. Stapleton accepted that
there had not been “precise compliance” with section 86. I do make
a finding of unsatisfactory
conduct, but the only order that I propose to make
is to reprimand Mr. Stapleton for his failure to comply with a provision of the
Act that is applicable in most matters handled by legal
practitioners.
Mr. Stapleton was charged secondly with four counts of
misconduct, or alternatively with four counts of unsatisfactory conduct, in
he contravened section 178(1) of the
Legal Practice Act 1996
by receiving
trust monies from the same client on four occasions when he did not hold a
practising certificate authorising him to
receive trust money (“the
remaining charges”). The trust monies were paid to Mr. Stapleton for work
yet to be done,
or for work only partly completed, and were deposited into Mr.
Stapleton’s office account.
Mr. Lovegrove, who appeared for Mr.
Stapleton, informed me that Mr. Stapleton did not appreciate that monies paid by
way of retainer
for work yet to be done are trust monies. There are two
fundamental requirements relating to the conduct of trust accounts that
relevant in matters of this kind. The first is that money received from a
client for work yet to be done is trust money. The
second is that trust money
deposited into a trust account must not be applied to the practitioner’s
own account as costs until
a bill of costs, or a statement of account, or a tax
invoice or an appropriate statement of some other kind is delivered to the
I accept that Mr. Stapleton believed that the monies he received
were not trust monies. On the other hand, it appears to me that
Mr. Stapleton
did not carefully turn his mind to that issue, despite the fact that he received
relatively large amounts of money
by way of retainer for work yet to be done or
only partly done. I am satisfied that Mr. Stapleton must have been aware that
not hold a practising certificate that authorised him to receive trust
monies. It is a specific condition forming part of a practising
certificate.
Furthermore, I am satisfied that Mr. Stapleton was “reckless”, as
that word is explained in the authorities,
in not making proper enquiry when he
received large amounts of money as to whether those monies were trust monies.
Instead, he simply
deposited the trust monies into his own account.
find Mr. Stapleton guilty of misconduct in relation to the four charges which
relate to four different amounts of money. I accept
that Mr. Stapleton appears
to have been naïve, as well as reckless. I am impressed by the character
evidence given by Dr. Shaw,
and also by the large bundle of references that have
been provided to me. I again reprimand Mr. Stapleton, on this occasion for
failure to comply with a fundamental provision of the Act relating to trust
accounts, a provision which in the public interest
requires strict compliance.
I accept that no measure of dishonesty was involved, but I must impose fines in
matters of this kind.
The amount of the fine normally imposed in matters of
this kind is about $1000 for each contravention of the Act, but in the light
the naivety on the part of Mr. Stapleton, the lack of dishonesty and the
impressive character evidence, I will impose one fine
of $1000, in reality $250
for each contravention.
following orders:
In relation to the first charge:
legal practitioner is reprimanded.
In relation to the remaining
2. The legal practitioner is reprimanded for his failure to comply with a
fundamental provision of the Act relating to trust monies.
3. The legal practitioner is to pay a fine of $1000 to the Legal Practice Board
by 1 August 2005.
4. The legal practitioner is to pay to Law Institute of Victoria Limited by 1
August 2005 its costs of these proceedings, fixed by
the Tribunal at
