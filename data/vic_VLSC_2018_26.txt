information) [2018] VLSC 26

STATEMENT OF REASONS
Advertisement:
complainant claims to be the executor of the Will of her late Uncle (the
Respondent Lawyer acts for the deceased’s siblings in relation to seeking
Letters of Administration of the deceased’s
21 June 2016 an advertisement was published on the Supreme Court of Victoria
Probate Online Advertising System (POAS), advertising
the Respondent
Lawyer’s intention to apply for Letters of Administration upon intestacy
in respect of the deceased’s
estate. In the advertisement the Respondent
Lawyer stated that he made the application as:
“the duly constituted
attorney under power of [Name 1] (the Sister), [Name 2] (the Brother), [Name 3]
(the Brother) and [Name
4] (the Brother) of [the deceased]
deceased...”
the time this advertisement was placed and published the Respondent Lawyer only
held a Power of Attorney in respect of [Name 1]
(as this Power of Attorney
document was dated 21 June 2016) but not in respect of [Name 2]
and [Name 4] (as these Power of Attorney Documents were dated 23 June
The Affidavit:
12 July 2016 the Respondent Lawyer filed an ‘Affidavit of
Administrator’ with the Supreme Court of Victoria sworn by
him that same
day, in support of an application for Letters of Administration of the estate of
[the deceased]. At paragraph 11 of
that affidavit the Respondent Lawyer
“11. I have made careful enquiry and search but am
unable to find any Will of the deceased.”
the time the Respondent Lawyer swore this affidavit there was a Writ and
Statement of Claim on foot that had been filed by the
Respondent Lawyer against
the complainant which had not been heard, seeking that she produce the
deceased’s purported Will.

Findings of fact and reasoning on issues under investigation
The Advertisement:
complainant alleged that the advertisement published by the Respondent Lawyer on
21 June 2016, on POAS advertising his intention
to apply for Letters of
Administration of the deceased estate of [the deceased] was false and misleading
because at the date of publication
of the advertisement the Respondent Lawyer
did not hold a duly executed power of attorney in respect of each of the
Respondent Lawyer explained that he was not responsible for placing that
advertisement on POAS. Instead, it was done by another
individual without his
approval. On the basis of the evidence obtained in the course of the
investigation, I accept the Respondent
Lawyer’s explanation.
Accordingly,
I find that this part of the complaint requires no further
investigation.
The Affidavit:
complainant alleged that an affidavit sworn by the Respondent Lawyer and dated
12 July 2016, which was filed in the Supreme Court
of Victoria in support of the
lawyer’s application for Letters of Administration made a false statement,
in stating the following:
“11. I have made careful enquiry
and search but am unable to find any Will of the deceased.”
The complainant considered the statement to be false because at the time the
Respondent Lawyer swore his affidavit there was still
a Writ and Statement of
Claim on foot that had been filed against the complainant by the Respondent
Lawyer, which had not yet been
heard, seeking that the complainant produce the
deceased’s purported Will. That is, the Respondent Lawyer could not say
unequivocally
that he was unable to find any Will of the deceased.
response to this allegation the Respondent Lawyer asserted that in preparing and
filing this affidavit he merely complied with
the directions provided to him by
the Registry of the Supreme Court of Victoria as well as the precedents and
guidelines published
by the Supreme Court of Victoria as to the form of wording
to be used. Furthermore, the Respondent Lawyer asserted that the affidavit
question was not an attempt to obtain any advantage over the complainant and her
claims regarding the deceased’s estate,
that his client’s had
nothing to hide and that if the Supreme Court had upon filing the affidavit and
associated documents,
requested any further information the Respondent Lawyer
would have provided it. I do not accept this explanation.
following a set procedure or directions, there must be an exercise of skill and
judgment in determining the appropriateness in
following that procedure or
direction. In this case, it was not appropriate for the Respondent Lawyer to
swear an affidavit containing
the statement set out in paragraph 11 of the
affidavit dated 12 July 2016 in circumstances where the Respondent Lawyer had an
application
on foot at that time seeking that the complainant produce the
deceased’s Will.
the basis of the evidence before me, and the matters set out in paragraph 20 to
22 above I find the following proved:
The Respondent Lawyer’s affidavit
sworn and filed on 12 July 2016 contained a statement at paragraph 11 which did
not represent
the true state of affairs at that
Relevant law
complaint was received on 1 September 2016, at which time the Uniform Law was in
complaint is about conduct that occurred in the period 21 June 2016 to 12 July
2016 at which time the Uniform Law was in operation.
296 of the Uniform Law prescribes that unsatisfactory professional conduct
includes the conduct of a lawyer occurring in connection
with the practice of
law that falls short of the standard of competence and diligence that a member
of the public is entitled to

Characterisation of the conduct
reason of the above findings of fact, I find the Respondent Lawyer has on 12
July 2016 sworn an affidavit which was filed with
the Supreme Court of Victoria
containing a statement at paragraph 11 which did not represent the true state of
affairs at that time.
am therefore satisfied that the Respondent Lawyer engaged in unsatisfactory
professional conduct within the meaning of section 296
of the Uniform Law in
that his conduct fell short of the standard of competence and diligence that a
member of the public is entitled
to expect of a reasonably competent
Determination & reasons
considered all of the evidence and relevant law, and having made the above
findings on the issues under investigation, I determine
that it is fair and
reasonable in all the circumstances to make the orders detailed above.
the conduct is towards the upper level of seriousness as an example of
unsatisfactory professional conduct a fine and additional
to Section 314 of the Uniform Law, a respondent lawyer or a legal practitioner
associate of a respondent law practice may,
in accordance with the applicable
legislation appeal to the VCAT, or seek a review by the VCAT, of this
determination made under
s299 of the Uniform
Non-compliance
failure to comply with a determination made under section 299 is capable of
constituting unsatisfactory professional conduct or
professional misconduct
pursuant to Section 298(h) of the Uniform Law.
