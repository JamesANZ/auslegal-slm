SOLICITORS:
Legal Services Commission for applicant
Michael Cooper Lawyer for respondent
[1] Ian George Marsh Richardson was found guilty before the Tribunal on 16 July
2009 of two charges of professional misconduct and
one charge of unsatisfactory
professional conduct as particularised on a number of occasions. The
Commissioner has applied for an
order pursuant to
s 456(2)(a)
Profession Act 2007
(Qld) (“the 2007 Act”) that he be removed from
the roll of legal practitioners. The respondent submitted that the appropriate
order in the circumstances was a fine.
[2] The Tribunal has taken into
account that he had references in his favour, has been in practice for a very
long period with no
previous adverse disciplinary findings and that he has been
affected by significant ill health. However, the Tribunal also took
account the serious matter that the charges of professional misconduct involved
findings of dishonesty and deceit by the legal
practitioner. As Spigelman CJ
held in NSW Bar Association v Cummins
[2001] NSWCA 284
(2001) 52 NSWLR 279
[19] “Honesty and
integrity are important in many spheres of conduct. However, in some spheres
significant public interests
are involved in the conduct of particular persons
and the state regulates and restricts those who are entitled to engage in those
activities and acquire the privileges associated with a particular status. The
legal profession has long required the highest standards
of integrity.
[20] There are four interrelated interests involved. Clients must feel
secure in confiding their secrets and in trusting their most
personal affairs to
lawyers. Fellow practitioners must be able to depend implicitly on the word and
the behaviour of their colleagues.
The judiciary must have confidence in those
who appear before the courts. The public must have confidence in the legal
by reason of the central role the profession plays in the
administration of justice. Many aspects of the administration of justice
on the trust by the judiciary and/or the public in the performance of
professional obligations by professional people.”
[3] The respondent’s behaviour was found to be dishonest and deceitful.
That behaviour was set out in full in the reasons
and there is no need to repeat it. A
finding of professional misconduct does not automatically result in removal from
Further, not every proved act of
dishonesty will result in a substantial penalty. In Attorney General v
Pincus JA said “... dishonesty,
like other forms of misbehaviour, has grades of
seriousness.”
Counsel for the
respondent submitted that the dishonesty of the applicant in charge 1 and 2 was
not serious enough to warrant removing
the applicant from the roll.
Tribunal disagrees. In relation to charge one, the respondent deposed that he
obtained his clients’ certificates of
title as a prudent, competent and
diligent solicitor, when in fact his primary purpose was to use the certificates
of title to advance
his own interests to the detriment of his clients. He
obtained the certificates of title without his clients’ instructions
thereby breaching his retainer. Further, he used his powers under the Enduring
Power of Attorney dishonestly to obtain the certificates
of title thereby
breaching his duties under the
Powers of Attorney Act 1998
The respondent knew that by retaining
the certificate of title it would cause difficulties for his clients lodging a
mortgage on
their property.
[5] The further
findings sought by the practitioner with regard to this charge are not strictly
relevant and, if made, some are as
likely to be exacerbating as they are to be
mitigatory. Any wrong headed beliefs justifying his dishonest behaviour do not
practitioner in a better light. Rather they would tend to show that he
is incompetent as well as dishonest. What matters with regard
to the first
charge was Mr Richardson acted both improperly and dishonestly in failing to
make full disclosure and seek instructions
from his clients because he knew that
if he did the client would instruct him not do what he proposed to do in
furtherance of his
own interests against the interests of his
[6] Charge 2 involved repeated acts of deceit and incompetence by the
applicant in relation to his client. Counsel for the respondent
submitted that
all that charge 2 amounted to was that the practitioner, embarrassed by errors
made, did not disclose his errors and
instead attempted to help the client out
of the difficult situation she faced. The Tribunal, however, found that
although the respondent
initially made an error in not making note of the date
of the directions hearing and failing to inform his clients, he then embarked
a course of concealment. He failed to seek instructions from his clients in
relation to the directions hearing, failed to inform
his clients that a judgment
had been entered against them and then made an application to have the judgment
set aside without obtaining
instructions. The client called the respondent
every day between 12 December and 24 December 2006. No one returned her calls.
She was then forced to attend a court hearing on 10 January 2007 without any
legal representation.
This is serious
misbehaviour by a legal practitioner from which the public is entitled to
protection.
[7] The charges of misconduct involve findings of dishonesty and
deceitfulness in Mr Richardson’s behaviour to his clients.
professional misconduct showed that he was not “a fit and proper person to
be entrusted with the important duties and
grave responsibilities of
solicitor”.
The Tribunal should declare
that Ian George Marsh Richardson was not a fit and proper person to remain on
the roll of legal practitioners.
The question remains whether or not he
continues to be so unfit at the time that that determination was made by the
[8] Although Mr Richardson
professed to have learned from his experiences, he behaved dishonestly and
deceitfully to his clients in
two unrelated matters. In each matter the
offending behaviour was sustained over a period of time. It was not momentary
or inadvertent.
His repeated failure to comply with requests for information
first from the Queensland Law Society and then from the Legal Services
Commission portrayed a complete lack of respect for the bodies set up to
regulate the legal profession and thereby protect the public
and an inability to
learn from his experiences.
[9] When considering the appropriate orders, as
the Commissioner submitted regard is to be had primarily to the need to protect
public and reputation of the
profession.
The public, the judiciary,
fellow practitioners and clients cannot have confidence in a practitioner
exhibiting such sustained dishonest
and deceitful behaviour.
determining whether an order of suspension would be more appropriate in the
circumstances, the question to be considered is
whether the respondent would
emerge from a period of suspension with a proper appreciation of his
professional responsibilities and
the capacity and determination to meet
The applicant submitted that there
was no evidence to support this.
[11] The Tribunal agrees with the
applicant’s submissions. The practitioner was not contrite and it did not
appear that such
behaviour would not be repeated in the future. Further, in
relation to some aspects of charge 1, he said in cross-examination that
not see the conflict of interest situation that he had created. Later he
finally conceded that he was not giving undivided
fidelity to his clients’
interests when he obtained the certificates of
He is lacking necessary attributes
required of a legal practitioner, and there is no indication that, over time,
the respondent
will learn from his
[12] His repeated failure to
comply with requests for information and documents required by the Queensland
Law Society and the Legal
Services Commissioner also shows his incapacity to
learn from his errors. He is not a fit and proper person to be a legal
practitioner.
He was at the time of his misconduct and the Tribunal is
satisfied that he remains so. The protection of the public requires his
from the roll.
[13] The Tribunal recommends that the name of Ian George Marsh
Richardson be removed from the roll of legal practitioners in the State
Queensland.
[14] The applicant requested the Tribunal to make a
costs order against the respondent under s 426(1) of the 2007 Act. The
did not oppose a costs order. The parties agreed that the costs
order should be in the sum of $20,000.
[15] The respondent is a sole
practitioner. It is in the interests of his clients to stay the operation of
the order recommending
the removal of his name from the roll of practitioners
for 14 days to allow an orderly transition of the clients of his practice
other legal practitioners. The Tribunal is prepared to grant such a stay in the
interests of his clients.
Compensation of the Complainant
[16] Mrs West,
the complainant in relation to charge 2, asked that the Tribunal make a
compensation order in her favour. The Tribunal
has the power to make a
compensation order under s 456(4)(b) of the 2007 Act. Relevant to these
proceedings is s 464(d) of the 2007
Act which provides:
compensation order
is 1 or more of the following—
(d) an order that a law practice pay to a complainant an amount by way of
compensation for pecuniary loss suffered because of conduct
that has been found
(i) unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct of an
Australian legal practitioner involved in the relevant practice;
(ii) misconduct of a law practice employee in relation to the relevant
[17] Section 465(1) of the 2007 Act provides that unless the parties agree, a
compensation order under s 464(d) for pecuniary loss
must not be made
unless the Tribunal is satisfied that:
“(a) if there is a complainant in relation to
the discipline application—that the complainant has suffered pecuniary
because of the conduct concerned; and
(b) that it is in the interests of justice that an order of that type be
[18] The circumstances of the charge proved are set out in Legal Services
Commissioner v Richardson [2009] LPT 17 at paragraphs [67]
to [123]. The
Tribunal found that the respondent’s behaviour was deceitful rather than
just incompetent, and that it constituted
professional
misconduct.
[19] In an email sent to the
respondent’s solicitor on 27 July 2009, the complainant particularised her
claim for compensation
as follows:
a) Judgment made against her in the
Magistrates Court $7,315
b) Legal fees & interest charged
c) filing fee $160.40
e) Costs awarded against her of the application
aside the judgment $310.00
f) Interest charged on the
judgment $159.65
Total: $9,557.00
[20] The complainant
conceded that the maximum amount she was entitled to claim under s 466(3)
of the 2007 Act was $7,500. She therefore
sought $7,500 in compensation from
the respondent.
[21] Clearly, the respondent is liable to pay compensation
to the complainant for (e) and (f) above because the respondent took it
himself to make an application to set aside the judgement, which consequently
failed, without obtaining instructions from the
complainant. The difficulty is
in determining the quantum of compensation owed, if any, in relation to steps
taken prior to this.
[22] Counsel for the respondent submitted that the
respondent’s liability to pay compensation was in fact limited to (e) and
(f) above: the costs of the dismissed application to set aside the judgement and
the interest charged in relation to that. The reasons,
they said, were
(a) the respondent was engaged after the contract had been signed, and so if the
complainant contracted to sell the pool heater with
the house, that was the
fault of the complainant rather than the respondent;
(b) Mrs West made a
conscious decision to retain the pool heater after becoming aware that the
plaintiffs had contracted to purchase
(c) The complainant cannot prove
that she could have successfully defended the action as her defence is based on
an affidavit from
the real estate agent which was never produced.
[23] It does appear that the solicitors were engaged after the contract was
signed. However the advice apparently given to the Wests
that the pool heater
was “a chattel to go to the purchaser” was not a statement one would
expect from a competent solicitor.
A chattel is not sold with real property
unless it is specifically listed in the contract or if it is no longer a chattel
become a fixture. It does appear likely that the pool heater was a
fixture and was therefore sold as part of the real property;
but the Wests were
not given this advice before settlement and the respondent’s firm did not
sort the problem out before settlement
as requested by Mrs West. If they had,
the Wests would have had to reinstall the pool heater they had removed or
compensate the
purchasers for the cost of replacing the pool heater unless they
could demonstrate that the purchasers had specifically agreed to
purchase the
property without the pool heater.
[24] Given that it appears more likely than
not that the Wests could not have successfully defended the claim against them
pool heater was a fixture, the respondent was not the cause of the loss
to the Wests represented by the cost of compensating the
purchasers for the cost
of replacing the pool heater. If Mr Richardson (or his staff) had clearly
informed the Wests of that prior
to settlement that would have been the extent
of the Wests’ loss.
[25] However, a judgment was entered against the
Wests after the respondent failed to advise them of the directions conference on
3 October 2006, and the requirement that they and legal representatives attend;
the respondent sent an inexperienced solicitor to
attend the directions
conference and seek an adjournment without obtaining instructions from the Wests
and without contacting the
solicitor to advise her the adjournment would be
opposed; and the solicitor arrived half an hour late to the directions
after getting lost, by which time judgement had already been made
against the complainant. The awarding of costs on that occasion
arose because
the respondent failed to ensure that the interests of the Wests were properly
represented. It is no defence to say
that he was not charging the Wests.
[26] All of the costs involved in this court case apart from the quantum of
the claim were caused by the respondent’s deception
and he should
compensate Mrs West $2,242 for those various costs and expenses ordered against
[27] In conclusion, the orders are as follows:
1. The Tribunal recommends that the respondent’s name be removed from the
local roll, to take effect 14 days from today;
2. The respondent must pay the
applicant’s costs of the proceedings fixed at $20,000.
respondent must pay Mrs West compensation in the amount of $2,242.
