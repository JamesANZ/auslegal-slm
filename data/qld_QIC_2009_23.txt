Thomas Borthwick & Sons (Australia) Pty Ltd v Gavin Wesche [2009] QIC 23; 191 QGIB 255 (25 June 2009)
[Extract from Queensland Government Industrial
dated 3 July, 2009, Vol. 191, No. 8, pages 255-257]
INDUSTRIAL COURT OF QUEENSLAND
Workplace Health
and Safety Act 1995
s. 164(3) - appeal against decision of
industrial magistrate
Thomas Borthwick & Sons (Australia) Pty Ltd
AND Gavin Scott Wesche (C/2009/2)
PRESIDENT HALL
25 June 2009
At all material times Thomas Borthwick & Sons (Australia) Pty Ltd
(hereafter Borthwick) operated a meatworks at Bakers Creek,
Mackay. The
cleaning function was contracted to an enterprise called Biniris (Aust) Pty Ltd
(hereafter Biniris). Ms Sally Delia
Agnes Burrows was an employee of Biniris.
She commenced cleaning at Borthwick meatworks at the beginning of November 2005.
at the outset, received an appropriate induction. The Industrial
Magistrate described the general nature of Ms Burrows' duties as
"Her usual hours of work were from 11.30 p.m. to 5.00 a.m. the following
morning. From about the start of her shift to about 4.00
a.m. she worked
cleaning in the boning room getting it ready for production the next day. Her
work involved cleaning the tables
and belts which involved a hot hosing down,
scrubbing and a cold hosing down.".
Ms Burrows also had a role in the quality assurance program. At some
time during the period 5.00 a.m. to 6.00 a.m., Ms Burrows would
be led through
the plant by Borthwick's Quality Assurance Officer. The various pieces of
equipment were examined to ensure that
the equipment had been cleaned to an
appropriate standard. It was whilst engaged on such an inspection on 6 June
2006 that Ms Burrows,
who was accompanied by Ms Sharwood (Quality Assurance
Officer) and Ms Sullivan (a Biniris Night Cleaning Supervisor), sustained an
injury amounting to grievous bodily harm. The Industrial Magistrate described
the course of events as follows:
"Ms. Sharwood in doing this inspection was walking down a passageway
that runs along side of the evisceration table which is essentially
conveyor belt on which is placed meat which is then processed, as it moves
along, by a number of workers standing at the sides
of this table. When
operating in this fashion guards are placed in position so as to prevent access
to the underneath part of the
table where the rollers are which moves it
Ms. Sharwood and Ms. Burrows were moving along this passageway intending to
inspect the top section which is a raised area where there
were wash basins. It
was Ms. Sharwood's usual practice to do the evisceration table last. It was
then that the evisceration table
would be locked out i.e. turned off with the
on/off switch locked and tagged so that it could not be turned on without the
being unlocked and turned on.
As they moved down this passageway the evisceration table was operating as it
was still being cleaned. It had to be operating i.e.
moving to be cleaned
properly. This passageway is within close proximity to the moving evisceration
table; Ms. Burrows noticed a
piece of meat caught on a roller under the table.
She then reached in to pick off this piece of meat and the sleeve of her jacket
got caught in the roller and her arm was jammed up against a stay bar. She
could not remove her arm as the table was still operating.".
I interpolate that the jacket was a white jacket provided for Ms Burrows'
use. Favourably to Borthwick, the Industrial Magistrate
found that Ms Burrows
reached in to remove the piece of meat although she knew that because of the
risk of injury, she should not
put her hand near the rollers.
investigation by the Division of Workplace Health and Safety, a complaint was
made before a Justice of the Peace that, contrary
to s. 24 of the
Health and Safety Act 1995
(the Act), Borthwick had failed to discharge the
workplace health and safety obligation cast upon the company by s. 28(1) of the
Act. The following particulars were given:
"Particulars
Other person: Sally Delia Agnes BURROWS.
Business or
Undertaking: Beef Processing.
Workplace: Bakers Creek,
Risk: The risk is the risk of injuries to workers including the risk of
fracture injuries to the right arm of Sally Delia Agnes
Hazard: The source of the risk emanates from:
a. plant namely the slaughter floor evisceration table; and
b. the system of work for the inspection of the plant on the slaughter
A circumstance of aggravation was alleged
the grievous
bodily harm sustained by Ms Burrows.
The complaint was contested. By a
decision of 15 December 2008, Borthwick was found to be guilty. By a decision
of 24 February 2009,
a conviction was recorded. Borthwick was fined $50,000;
ordered to pay professional costs of $1,825; witness expenses of $240;
investigation
costs of $923.50; and costs of court of $66.40. This is an appeal
against the finding of guilt and, in the alternative, against
the quantum of the
Counsel for Borthwick submits that the Industrial Magistrate
expressly found that Borthwick had in place a system of work which complied
the Plant Code of Practice 2005. It is said to follow that the defence at s.
37(1)(b) of the Act had been made out. The response
of Counsel for the
Complainant is that the Industrial Magistrate found that Borthwick had adopted,
but had not followed a stated
way to prevent a contravention. On such a finding
the defence at s. 37(1)(a) is not open. That submission seems to me to be
However, the reason given by the Industrial Magistrate for the finding
The critical
paragraph in the Industrial Magistrate's decision is:
"I accept that Borthwick had in place a system of work which complied with
the Australian Standard which was incorporated into the
Plant Code of Practice
2005. It is also clear in my judgment that on the 6th June 2006 it was not
being complied with. It was not
being complied with in that Ms. Burrows was
allowed access to unguarded operating plant.".
While the Industrial Magistrate does not explain why it was that His
Honour focussed on what Ms Burrows was allowed to do, it seems
to me to be
tolerably clear that His Honour was seeking to give effect to s. 6.3.2 of the
Australian Standard - Conveyors - Safety
Requirements AS1755-2000, which was
adopted by the Plant Code of Practice 2005 upon which Borthwick had relied at
trial (and upon
the Appeal). Section 6.3.2 is in the following
6.3.2 Access or work in a danger zone
Access to, or work in, a danger zone shall not be permitted while the
conveyor is running. Where any access or work, except in accordance
with clause
6.3.3, is to be undertaken in a danger zone, the procedures shall include energy
isolation of the conveyor by the operation
of the main isolation device (see
Clause 2.7.3). All other sources of energy associated with the conveyor and
which may create a
hazard shall also be isolated in an appropriate
As is made apparent by the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary
(3rd ed), a primary meaning of "permit" is "... allow the doing or occurrence
Put aside Borthwick's contention that the Industrial Magistrate
should have given the basis for the finding that Ms Burrows had entered
within a "danger zone", three issues merit comment.
First, whether under
the Act in the form which it took at the relevant time, a code of practice
amounted to delegated legislation;
Maynard v Rover Mowers Ltd
[2000] QCA 26
dealing with the
Workplace Health and Safety Act 1989
Australian Standard - Conveyors - Safety Requirements AS1755-2000 is not in the
nature of delegated legislation. There can
be difficulty where, as here, such a
standard is adopted by a code of practice. If "shall not be permitted" is read
as "shall not
allow", s. 6.3.2 sits ill with the cross-reference to the Risk
Management Code of Practice 2000 made by the Plant Code of Practice
Appendix I - Human Error. Context is always everything and there is something
to be said for the view that "shall not
permit" means "shall (successfully)
Second, the Industrial Magistrate did not particularise the
evidence relied upon for the finding that Ms Burrows had been "allowed
to the danger area, and Counsel for the Complainant has been unable to take the
Court to a body of evidence which would support
the finding. On the face of the
transcript, the finding was not open.
Third, if one should take the
alternative approach and enquire whether access was (successfully) prohibited,
the conclusion that Borthwick
did not (successfully) prohibit access by Ms
Burrows seems to follow from the fact of the injury and its circumstances.
the Act is about absolute delegations - not about strict liability.
Borthwick is entitled to and does seek to rely on the *defence
at s. 37(2) of
the Act. [*The defence was also agitated at first instance.] Whilst I accept
all that was said by Dutney J in
Schmidt v Woolworths (Queensland) Pty Ltd
and Crown Equipment Pty Ltd
[2009] QSC 106
, in the context of a
prosecution it seems to me that rather than enquire whether the matter is one of
"occasional careless lapse"
by an employee, one should stubbornly adhere to the
statutory language and enquire whether a defendant has established that the
of the offence was due to causes over which the defendant had no
control. A consequence of the finding that "access" was, of course,
allowed was
that the defence at s. 37(2) was not considered at first instance.
given consideration to re-hearing the matter on the record. On other occasions
that course has been adopted. Here critical
primary facts remain to be found.
There is some attraction in the idea that a defendant in a criminal matter is
entitled to a determination
by a tribunal which has heard the evidence.
Credibility is not the only issue. A querulous arbiter of fact may be answered.
who has not observed the trial develop may place great weight on an
untaken point which, if raised, may have been met by evidence
concession. Given that the trial was (very) brief, the proper course seems to
me to be to remit the matter to the Industrial
Magistrate at Mackay.
allow the Appeal. I set aside the decision of the Industrial Magistrate and
remit the matter to the Industrial Magistrate at Mackay
to be heard and
determined according to law.
