Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority v Director of National Parks

No. 2 of 2021 (22132661)
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ABORIGINAL AREAS PROTECTION AUTHORITY
Complainant
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL PARKS (ABN 13 051 694 963)
ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF THE COMMONWEALTH
CORAM: GRANT CJ, SOUTHWOOD & BARR JJ
REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
(Delivered 30 September 2022)
[1] By complaint taken on 11 September 2020, the Chief Executive Officer of
the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority (
the Authority
) charged that
the Director of National Parks (
the Director
) conducted works at Gunlom
Falls between 22 March and 30 April 2019 in breach of
Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1989
Sacred Sites Act
[2] On 8 October 2021, the Local Court stated a special case under
Local Court (Criminal Procedure) Act 1928
(NT) reserving the
following question of law arising on the complaint for the opinion of the
Supreme Court:
Do the offence and penalty prescribed by
Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1989
(NT) not apply to the Director of
National Parks:
(a) as a matter of statutory construction; or
(b) alternatively, because they are beyond the legislative power of the
Legislative Assembly, conferred by
Northern Territory
(Self-Government) Act 1978
Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976
[3] On 16 November 2021, the Supreme Court referred the special case stated
by the Local Court to the Full Court of the Supreme Court
of the Northern
Territory under
Supreme Court Act 1979
(NT). For the
reasons which follow, the question of law is answered:
The offence and penalty prescribed by
Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1989
(NT) do not apply to the Director
of National Parks as a matter of statutory construction.
The relevant provisions of the
Sacred Sites Act
[4] Section 34 of the
Sacred Sites Act
(1) A person
shall not carry out work on or use a sacred site.
Maximum penalty: In the case of a natural person –
400 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years.
In the case of a body corporate –
2 000 penalty units.
(2) It is a
defence to a prosecution for an offence against subsection (1) if it is proved
that the defendant carried out the work
on or used the sacred site with, and in
accordance with the conditions of, an Authority Certificate or a Minister's
Certificate permitting
the defendant to do so.
[5] Section 4 of the
Sacred Sites Act
(1) This Act
binds the Territory Crown and, to the extent the legislative power of the
Legislative Assembly permits, the Crown in
all its other capacities.
Territory Crown in any of its capacities commits an offence against this Act,
the Territory Crown is liable in that capacity
to be prosecuted for the offence
as if it were a body corporate.
(3) This section
does not affect any liability of an officer, employee or agent of the Territory
Crown to be prosecuted for an offence.
(4) In this
Territory Crown means the Crown in right of the Territory and includes:
(a) an Agency; and
(b) an authority or instrumentality of the Territory Crown.
Procedural history
[6] On 3 June 2021, the Commonwealth Attorney-General intervened in the
proceedings brought by complaint in the Local Court. That
intervention was made
Judiciary Act 1903
(Cth) for the purpose of
submitting on behalf of the federal executive government that s 34 of the
Sacred Sites Act
does not impose criminal liability on the Director.
[7] On 8 October 2021, the Director entered a plea of not guilty on the basis
that it cannot be convicted of the offence created by
s 34 of the
. At that time, the parties admitted and agreed various facts and
matters for the purpose of the special case, including the authenticity
documents annexed to the special case. Those facts, matters and documents are
as described below.
The works carried out at Gunlom Falls
[8] On 22 March 2019, the Director arranged for a contractor to be engaged to
perform construction works on the realignment of the
walking track at Gunlom
Falls, in the Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory of Australia
the track realignment works
[9] Stage 1 of the track realignment works located at the lower portion of
the Gunlom Falls walking track commenced on or about 4
April 2019. Those works
were completed during the course of April 2019 by excavating and clearing trees,
rock, soil and vegetation
along the existing walking track and inserting
concrete steps at various points along the realigned walking track.
[10] The area on which the track realignment works were carried out is sacred
to the Jawoyn Aboriginal people or is otherwise of significance
according to
Aboriginal tradition, and is a ‘sacred site’ as defined in the
Sacred Sites Act
[11] The Director carried out the track realignment works without an
Authority Certificate or a Minister’s Certificate under
[12] Subject to the answer to the question of law concerning the application
of s 34(1) the
Sacred Sites Act
, the facts set out in the four
preceding paragraphs would constitute an offence by the Director under
s 34(1), subject to any defences
available under s 36 and any
operational inconsistency in the circumstances of this case between s 34(1)
Sacred Sites Act
and Div 4 of
Environment
Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
The Director and its operational arrangements
[13] The Director is a corporation sole with perpetual succession established
National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975
(Cth) and continued in existence as a body corporate by s 514A of the
. The Director ‘may sue and be sued in its corporate
The Director is a
corporate Commonwealth entity for the purposes of the
Public Governance,
Performance and Accountability Act 2013
(Cth). The functions and powers of
the Director include those specified in Division 5 of Part 19 of the
. The Director has the function to administer, manage and
control Commonwealth reserves.
[14] The incumbent Director at the material times was appointed by the
Governor-General, on the advice of the responsible Commonwealth
Minister, with
effect from 26 November 2018.
all material times, the incumbent Director was also the head of the Parks
Australia division of the Commonwealth Department of
Agriculture, Water and the
Environment which was as at that time called the Department of Environment and
the Department
The Parks Australia division of the Department provides policy advice to the
Minister in relation to the management of Commonwealth
reserves, and supports
the Director in the exercise of its powers and
[15] The staff of the Director consists entirely of personnel of the Parks
Australia division of the Department, engaged by the Department
Public Service Act 1999
(Cth) or, where there is an operational need for
a specific task, provided under labour-hire style arrangements. The Secretary
the Department is the Agency Head for the staff of the Director. All of the
functions and powers of an employer as conferred by
Service Act 1999
rest with the Secretary. Those powers, in so far as they
relate to the engagement and management of Department staff associated
Director’s functions, have been delegated to the Director. Salary and
salary-related funds for the majority of those
staff are debited from the
Australian National Parks Fund continued in existence under s 514R of the
, with the remainder being paid out of Departmental funds.
[16] The Director relies on the staffing and resources provided by the
Department to carry out the functions specified in s 514B of
, and to properly manage the resources of the corporation in accordance
with the Commonwealth Resource Management Framework underpinned
Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013
(Cth). The Parks
Australia division of the Department relies on the same human resources, finance
and legal services personnel and
systems as does the rest of the Department.
[17] The arrangements under which the Parks Australia division of the
Department supports the Director stem from a Memorandum of Understanding
between the Director and the Secretary of the Department of the Environment and
Heritage (as the Department was then styled)
on 1 June 2001 (
The MOU stated that its
purpose was to:
... record[s] the agreement between the Secretary and the Director in
relation to the contribution by the Director to Outcome 1 of
the Department of
the Environment and Heritage Portfolio Budget Statement and the provision of
resources by the Secretary to the
Director to enable the Director to perform the
Director's functions and discharge the Director's obligations under the EPBC
other Acts, contracts and agreements.
[18] A series of Service Delivery Agreements have been entered into between
the Secretary of the Department and the Director to deal
with the provision of
resources to the Director by the Department that is contemplated in the MOU.
The most recent of these was
made on 1 June 2013.
[19] Section 514D(5) of the
provides that the responsible
Commonwealth Minister must approve any contract that the Director enters into
over the value of $1
million. Over the past seven years there have been at
least 17 contracts or memoranda of understanding which the Minister has
including in relation to capital infrastructure, operational costs,
information and communication technologies and construction
[20] The arrangement with the contractor to perform the track realignment
works did not require Ministerial approval pursuant to s
514D(5) of the
The Director took
decisions itself and through its servants and agents to perform the track
realignment works.
Kakadu National Park and its Management Plan
[21] The area where the track realignment works were carried out is within
the Kakadu National Park, which is a Commonwealth reserve
under Division 4 of
Part 15 of the
. The Proclamation of the Park is continued by
Schedule 4 item 3 of the
Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Act
(Cth) as if made under s 344 of the
[22] That part of the Park where the track realignment works were carried out
is held under a lease by the Director from the Gunlom
Aboriginal Land Trust
granted in accordance with the
Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory)
Land Rights
provides for the making of protocols for conduct in relation to sacred sites.
The current protocol is the ‘Buladjang
(Sickness Country) Access
Protocols’ dated September
[23] At all material times, including when the Director arranged for the
track realignment works and when those works were carried
out, a management plan
was in operation for Kakadu National Park, namely, the
Kakadu National Park
Management Plan 2016-2026
the Management
Presumption that statutes do not bind the executive government
[24] Against that background, the general presumption is that legislation
regulating the conduct or rights of individuals does not
apply to the members of
the executive government of the polity enacting the legislation, or the members
of the executive governments
of other polities in the
federation.
The presumption can
be displaced by a contrary legislative intention either by express words or
implied from the statutory context,
including the text, subject matter, purpose
and policy of the statute, and the activities of government to which it has
application.
Where the question
is whether legislation binds the executive government of a polity other than the
polity of the enacting legislature,
it is necessary to identify an intention to
bind the executive of that other
[25] A related presumption, sometimes treated as distinct and sometimes
is that a statute will not
impose criminal liability on the executive, including government
instrumentalities with the same legal
status, without the clear indication of a
legislative intention and purpose to do
That presumption applies
to the imposition of criminal liability on the executive of a
polity other than the enacting
[26] The decision of the High Court in
is an earlier
application of the presumption that a statute is not properly construed to
impose criminal liability on the Crown without
the clearest of indications. The
Re-establishment and Employment Act
(Cth) made it a criminal offence
for an employer to terminate the employment of a reinstated former employee
without reasonable cause.
The legislation also provided that, ‘unless the
contrary intention appears – “employer” includes the Crown
(whether in right of the Commonwealth or of a State) and any authority
constituted by or under the law of the Commonwealth or of
a State or Territory
of the Commonwealth’.
[27] A criminal prosecution was commenced against the manager of a munitions
factory owned and operated by the Commonwealth for aiding
and abetting the
termination of a reinstated employee in breach of the prohibition. A majority
of the High Court held that the provision
did not create an offence of which the
Commonwealth may be guilty, and the manager therefore could not be convicted of
abetting the Commonwealth in the commission of a criminal offence.
In coming to that conclusion, Dixon J (as his Honour then was)
There is, I think, the strongest presumption against attaching to a statutory
provision a meaning which would amount to an attempt
to impose upon the Crown a
liability of a criminal nature. It is opposed to all our conceptions,
constitutional, legal and historical.
Conceptions of this nature are, of
course, not immutable and we should beware of giving effect to the strong
presumption in their
favour in the face of some clear expression of a valid
intention to infringe upon them. But we should at least look for quite certain
indications that the legislature had adverted to the matter and had advisedly
resolved upon so important and serious a course.
[28] While Dixon J accepted that the prohibition against terminating the
employment of a reinstated employee applied to the Crown
in right of the
Commonwealth (in recognition of the statutory stipulation that
‘employer’ included the Crown in right
of the Commonwealth), his
Honour concluded that the penalty provision attending that prohibition was meant
to apply only to the subject
and not to the Crown. Accordingly, while a
prohibition of that nature might be enforced by injunction, mandamus or ordinary
remedies, it did not impose a criminal liability on the Crown. Chief
Justice Latham
generally agreed with that
conclusion, with the Chief Justice opining that the statutory stipulation of the
Crown as an ‘employer’
for the purposes of the legislation operated
on other provisions governing the conduct of employers which did not create
[29] The same bifurcation of civil and criminal liability is evident in
State Authorities Superannuation Board v Commissioner of State Taxation
The Western
Australian stamp duty legislation under consideration in that case exempted from
duty instruments to which the Crown
or any Crown instrumentality, agent or
authority designated by the Minister was a party otherwise liable to pay duty.
The ‘Crown’
was defined to mean the Crown in right of the State of
Western Australia. The question arising was whether the State Authorities
Superannuation Board, a statutory body representing the Crown in right of the
State of New South Wales, was liable to duty under
the Western Australian
legislation as the purchaser of real estate in Perth.
[30] Chief Justice Brennan and Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ found that the
provision for exemption manifested a clear intention that
the Crown (in whatever
capacities) should be otherwise bound by the provisions of the
legislation.
Justices McHugh
and Gummow framed the question as whether the Western Australian legislature
intended to tax agreements for the
purchase of property in Western Australia by
another State authority, and concluded that the legislation applied according to
Those findings were
sufficient to dispose of the contention that the State Authorities
Superannuation Board was not bound to pay
duty. However, all members of the
Court applied
Cain v Doyle
to find that the presumption of statutory
interpretation that the Crown cannot be criminally liable ‘must prevail
over anything
but the clearest expression of intention’. No such
intention was manifest in the stamp duty legislation notwithstanding that
provisions imposing duty otherwise
In context, that
discussion concerning the application of the presumption was not limited to the
Crown in right of the State of
New South Wales as a legal person.
[31] Those statements of principle from
Cain v Doyle
Authorities Superannuation Board v Commissioner of State Taxation (WA)
again endorsed in
Telstra Corporation Ltd v
So far as is
relevant for these purposes, the New South Wales workers compensation
legislation under consideration in that matter
was expressed to bind ‘the
Crown, not only in right of New South Wales but also, so far as the legislative
power of Parliament
permits, in all its other capacities’. A central
provision of that legislative scheme was the requirement, under the sanction
a penalty, that an employer maintain a compliant policy of insurance. In
considering whether the Commonwealth as an employer
was subjected to that
liability, the High Court unanimously stated:
It will require the clearest indication of a legislative purpose to
demonstrate that these penal provisions attach to the Commonwealth
[1946] HCA 38
(1946) 72 CLR 409
State Authorities Superannuation Board v
Commissioner of State Taxation (WA)
[1996] HCA 32
(1996) 189 CLR 253
at 270, 277, 294;
Re Residential Tenancies Tribunal (NSW); Ex parte Defence Housing
(1997) 190 CLR 410 at 427,472]. No such indication is to be seen
in the 1987 State Act. To the contrary, s 6(2) states that nothing
statute renders "the Crown" liable to be prosecuted for any offence. These
penal provisions are central to the structure
upon which the regulatory scheme
established by the State legislation rests.
[32] At a more general level, the decision of the High Court in
Western Australia
starting point of what might be considered as the modern approach to the
operation of the presumption that legislation regulating
the conduct or rights
of individuals does not apply to the members of the executive government. The
question presenting in
was whether a development corporation
created by statute was immune from prosecution for a contravention of heritage
legislation,
including the individuals acting on its behalf in the impugned
conduct. The statute which created the corporation provided expressly
was an agent of the Crown in right of the State of Western Australia which
enjoyed the status, immunities and privileges
of the Crown. The purpose of the
heritage legislation was to preserve places and objects customarily used by or
traditional to Aboriginal
people, irrespective of where those things were found
or situated in the State.
[33] The plurality in
identified the presumption to be that, in
the absence of a contrary intention, the general words of a statutory provision
extend to bind the executive government and its servants or agents in
relation to acts which they do or property which they own or
occupy in that
capacity. That contrary intention may be manifested expressly or by
‘necessary implication’, but the
latter phrase does not import a
formalised test of exacting
stringency.
particularly so given that many of the considerations underlying the presumption
have diminished in their relevance with
the evolution of ‘the Crown’
to include a myriad of governmental commercial and industrial instrumentalities
[34] While the plurality acknowledged the weight of past authority favouring
the preservation of an inflexible and stringent approach
to the shield of the
Crown, in the contemporary context a legislative intention to bind the Crown
does not require that the intention
be ‘manifest from the very
terms’ of the statute or that the purpose of the statute would otherwise
frustrated’. Rather, the intention must ‘be found
in the provisions of the statute – including its subject matter
disclosed purpose and policy – when construed in a context which includes
permissible extrinsic
In that analysis
it is possible that the legislation may evince a legislative intent not to apply
directly to the Crown or an instrumentality,
but to bind employees and
[35] The plurality qualified that conclusion by noting that in construing a
legislative provision enacted before the publication of
the decision in that
case, it may be necessary to take account of the fact that the more stringent
tests were seen as of general
application at the time the provision was enacted.
On the other hand, in the case of legislative provisions enacted subsequent to
the publication of the decision in
, the strength of the
presumption will depend upon the content and purpose of the particular provision
and the identity of the entity
concerned. That is particularly so in relation
to ‘the employees of a governmental corporation engaged in commercial and
developmental
activities’.
It may be noted in that respect that the
Sacred Sites Act
was enacted
prior to the publication of the decision in
; and, for reasons
discussed further below,
the Director is not properly characterised as a
governmental corporation engaged in commercial and developmental activities in
same manner as the development corporation there under consideration.
[36] The plurality in
concluded that the heritage legislation
evinced a clear legislative intent that the offence provision (which proscribed
the alteration
of, damage to,
an Aboriginal site without the
necessary authorisation or consent), had application to employees and agents of
government instrumentalities
in the course of their duties. That intention was
discerned on the basis that the heritage legislation applied expressly to all
objects irrespective of where found or situated in the State; applied by
implication to Crown land (which comprised 93 percent of
Western Australian
land); and, having regard to its subject matter and disclosed policy and
purpose, applied by implication indifferently
to natural persons, including
government employees.
plurality considered that it was unnecessary to decide whether the development
corporation was also liable to prosecution and
conviction for offences committed
by its employees or agents, because once it had been concluded that the offence
provision applied
to those employees or agents neither the corporation nor the
Crown had power to authorise the performance of proscribed activities.
[37] In separate reasons for decision, Justice Brennan (as his Honour then
was) concurred with the conclusion and orders proposed
by the plurality, but
expressly disavowed the notion that different interpretive considerations would
apply to statutes enacted prior
to the publication of the
On that approach, the
question will always be whether the legislature intended that the statute should
affect the activities of
the executive government having regard to the terms of
the statute, its subject matter, the nature of the mischief to be redressed,
general purpose and effect of the statute, and the nature of the governmental
activities which would be
Justice Brennan also
distinguished the finding of immunity in
from the subject case
on the basis that the Crown could conceivably have been a principal offender as
employer under the
Re-establishment and Employment Act
, whereas the
Crown’s only potential criminal liability under the heritage legislation
was as a secondary party under provisions
which could not properly be construed
as imposing a vicarious criminal liability on the Crown (or, by extension, the
development
corporation).
[38] A number of matters should be recognised about the decision in
in its application to the present case. First, the decision in
is not authority for the proposition that the statutory
corporation in that case was subject to the general offence provision in
heritage legislation notwithstanding its agency of the Crown. The finding in
was only that by implication the criminal offence provision in the
heritage legislation applied indifferently to natural persons,
government employees, having regard to the subject matter, disclosed policy and
purpose of that particular legislation.
predated the
decisions in
State Authorities Superannuation Board v Commissioner of State
Taxation (WA)
Corporation Ltd v Worthing
both of which reaffirmed the strength of the presumption against the imposition
of criminal liability on the Crown. Thirdly, the
decision in
concerned with the imposition of criminal liability on the agents of the
executive of the enacting polity rather than the executive
of another polity.
[39] As the submissions made by the parties at the hearing of the special
case were developed, the questions which present for determination
in the first
limb of the special case are:
(a) whether the Director is an entity to which the presumption against the
imposition of criminal liability on the executive government
is capable of
application;
(b) if so, whether the Director is intended to have the same legal status as
executive government in relation to the operation of
the presumption having

it is established; and

Sacred Sites Act
, either expressly or by
implication, discloses a legislative intention to impose criminal liability on
the Commonwealth executive
government having regard to the terms of the statute,
its subject matter, the nature of the mischief to be redressed, the general
purpose and effect of the statute, and the nature of the governmental activities
which would be affected.
Entities to which the presumption applies
Cain v Doyle
, Latham CJ suggested that while Ministers and
officers of the Crown can be guilty of breaches of Commonwealth law attracting
penalties, it was inconsistent with the fundamental idea of the
criminal law that breaches are offences against the ‘King’s
peace’ to hold that the Crown can itself be guilty of a criminal
However, that
is inconsistent with the orthodox view, even at that time, that
the legislature may with clearly expressed intention impose a criminal
upon the Crown. In addition, and to the extent that
taken to suggest otherwise, the presumption in relation to criminal liability
also extends beyond the Crown in its narrowest
conception.
[41] It is not possible in the determining the entities to which the
presumption applies to draw rigid taxonomical distinctions based
different manifestations and emanations of the Crown. As Gleeson CJ,
Gummow and Hayne JJ observed in
, the term ‘the
Crown’ identifies the executive branch of government represented by the
Ministry and the administrative
bureaucracy which tends to its business. In the
ordinary conception, that administrative bureaucracy includes authorities and
instrumentalities
of the Crown, including statutory corporations.
[42] There are authorities and considered
effectively binding on
this Court which establish that the presumption has application to government
instrumentalities, including
those with separate legal personality, if on proper
characterisation they are intended to have the same legal status as executive
government in the relevant aspects. Speaking specifically of the presumption
against the imposition of criminal liability, the plurality
stated that it was not ‘confined to the Sovereign herself but extends to
confer prima facie immunity in relation to the activities
of governmental
instrumentalities or agents acting in the course of their functions or duties as
Similarly, in
Commonwealth v Western Australia (Mining Act Case)
, Gleeson CJ and Gaudron J
expressed the presumption with reference to ‘members of the executive
government of any of the polities
in the federation, government
instrumentalities and authorities intended to have the same legal status as the
executive government,
their servants or
[43] That the presumption is capable of application to statutory corporations
with separate legal personality is also implicit, if
not express, in the finding
State Authorities Superannuation Board v Commissioner of State Taxation
that if the Board did form part of the Crown in the relevant sense it
could not be criminally liable for offences created by the
legislation.
The operative
question is whether on proper characterisation the body in question is intended
to have the same legal status as executive
government in the relevant aspect,
and the conferral of that status may be either express or
from the subject matter,
policy and purpose of the legislation creating the body.
Analytical framework for determining legal status
[44] The approach taken to the status of executive government bodies in the
context of governmental immunities generally is not rigid,
inflexible or
constrained. In
State Authorities Superannuation Board v Commissioner of
State Taxation (WA)
High Court was not required in the final result to determine whether the
statutory superannuation corporation enjoyed the same
legal status as the
executive government. However, McHugh and Gummow JJ did determine the question
of whether the corporation formed
part of the ‘State’ of New South
Wales for constitutional purposes. Their Honours stated, with reference to
Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v State Bank
government-owned and controlled authority or instrumentality carrying on the
activities of government falls within the constitutional
conception of a
‘State’, even where that body has an independent corporate
personality. Their Honours concluded that
the State Authorities Superannuation
Board fell within that conception having regard to its constituent statute, its
powers and functions,
the relevant auditing provisions, the method of
appointment and removal of board members, and the history of the public
administration
of civil service superannuation in New South
Although the question
whether a body is a ‘State’ for constitutional purposes is not to be
determined by asking whether
the body is entitled to the shield of the
similar considerations
are relevant, by analogy at least, in determining whether a statutory
corporation has the same legal status
as executive government for the purpose of
the presumption against the imposition of criminal liability.
[45] The subsequent decision in
SGH Ltd v Commissioner of
considered whether
a building society established under Queensland legislation was the
‘State’ for the purposes of the
prohibition under
Constitution
against the imposition by the Commonwealth of any tax on
property belonging to a State. It was found not to be, on the basis that
was nothing in the rules of the society or the governing statute which required
the society to pursue the State or public interest,
or to follow policies
determined by the executive government. However, the plurality observed that
the concept of government in
that context was not to be understood narrowly, and
was to be determined having regard to ‘the conceptions of ordinary
Similarly, albeit
at a more general level, the plurality in
observed that in
the field of inter-governmental immunities it is necessary to ‘avoid
pedantic and narrow constructions’.
SGH Ltd v Commissioner of
the considerations
said to be relevant to determining whether an entity falls within the
description of the ‘State’ will
include the activities undertaken by
that entity; the legal relationship between the entity and the executive
government of the body
politic; what rights or powers the executive government
of the body politic has over the use and disposal of the entity’s
and whether the entity is discharging governmental functions for the
body politic in the sense that the body politic is carrying
on its business
through a statutory corporation. The same general approach is taken to the
question of whether an entity is properly
characterised as the
‘Commonwealth’ for the purposes of
Constitution
. In that context, the relevant question has been framed as
whether the intention appearing from the provisions of the relevant statute
‘an intention that the Commonwealth shall operate in a particular field
through a corporation created for that purpose;
or ... on the other hand, an
intention to put into the field a corporation to perform its functions
independently of the
Commonwealth’.
similar overarching consideration will govern whether an entity has the same
status as the executive government for the
purpose of the presumption in
relation to criminal liability.
Superannuation Fund Investment Trust v Commissioner of Stamps
a question arose as to
whether the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust could claim an exemption under
South Australian stamp duty
law for conveyances or transfers ‘to the
Crown, or to any person on behalf of the Crown’. The Trust was a body
established by Commonwealth legislation. Those members of the Court
who considered it necessary to decide the issue were divided
on the result, but
not on the basic principles to be applied in making the characterisation.
Drawing on the reasons in that case,
counsel for the Attorney-General of the
Commonwealth in this matter posits a number of propositions informing that
determination.
Those propositions should be accepted as governing the question
whether the Director has the same legal status as the Commonwealth
purposes of the presumption against the imposition of criminal liability.
[48] First, the fact that an entity is incorporated is not determinative of
whether it forms part of the executive government for
the purpose of privileges
and immunities, or indicative of an intention to divorce the entity or its
activities from the executive
government.
It has long been
accepted that governmental functions may be carried out through statutory
corporations ‘for the convenience
as well of management as of the
assertions and enforcement of contractual rights in respect of the commercial
transactions’
entered into by those
corporations.
Secondly, the
enquiry is essentially one of statutory interpretation to determine the relevant
legislative intent, rather than the
mechanical application of any particular
Thirdly, the presence or
absence of a statutory ability on the part of the executive government to
control the membership and/or
activities of the entity in question is of central
importance to the discernment of the relevant legislative intention. The higher
the degree of direction or control the more likely the legislative intention
that the entity be treated as the
However, that assessment
turns upon the existence of a statutory ability to control, rather than an
examination of the extent to
which a particular action is the result of the
actual exercise of control by the
Fourthly, the
interpretive process will also involve a consideration of whether the entity
performs governmental functions, whether
it is funded by the executive
government, and whether it is accountable to the executive government in terms
of finances and outcomes.
[49] The subsequent decision in
Townsville Hospital Board v Townsville
City Council
may be seen as
an application of principles similar to those expressed in
Superannuation
Fund Investment Trust v Commissioner of Stamps (SA)
. The question was
whether the Hospital Board enjoyed the exemption from the building by-laws for
buildings erected by or on behalf
of the Crown, or by or on behalf of a body
representing the Crown for the purpose of erecting the building. The land on
building was to be erected was Crown land, and the Hospital Board had
been required under the provisions of the governing legislation
to obtain the
Minister’s approval to borrow money for the proposed works. Those
connections notwithstanding, Gibbs CJ (with
whom the other members of the Court
agreed) determined that the Hospital Board did not enjoy the privileges and
immunities of the
Crown in their relevant aspect. That conclusion was reached
largely on the basis that the legislation did not give rise to that
implication
in circumstances where the provision of hospital services is not a traditional
function of government; the Hospital Board
retained an independent discretion to
decide whether to engage in building work; the Board rather than the Crown bore
ultimate responsibility
for the repayment of any moneys borrowed for that
purpose; and the stringent controls imposed on the borrowing of moneys were not
directed to achieving the objects of the building
legislation.
The legal status of the Director
[50] Turning then to the character and legal status of the Director, the
facts agreed for the purpose of the special case disclose
that it is a statutory
corporation with separate legal personality, and the essential function
conferred on it by statute is to administer,
manage and control Commonwealth
While that function
involves, in part, commercial and developmental activity, the entry by the
Commonwealth into the management
of national parks was not an expansion by
government into commercial and developmental activities in the general
marketplace in the
same way as, for example, the establishment of a government
development corporation.
[51] Prior to federation, some colonies had already commenced proclaiming or
otherwise creating reserves styled as ‘national
parks’. The States
continued that practice after federation and were the owners and managers of
those parks. The
Constitution
did not confer legislative authority or
executive power on the Commonwealth expressly or specifically with respect to
environmental
planning and management. It was not until the mid-1970s that the
Commonwealth took a more substantial role in the management of
the national
environment through the creation of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and
the Australian Heritage Commission,
and the enactment of uniform environmental
protection legislation. Those initiatives were directed to the objectives of
environmental
conservation and the protection of biodiversity, and invoked the
implied nationhood power in support of a new field of Commonwealth
governmental
[52] As part of those initiatives, the Director was established and
incorporated by
National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act
the 1975 Act
). This was the first national legislation
providing for the creation by the Australian Government of such national parks
appropriate to its status as a national government; as were necessary to
carry out its international legal obligations and exercise
its international
legal rights; and as were conducive to encouraging international tourism to
That was achieved by
empowering the Governor-General to declare by Proclamation an area to be a park
or reserve and to assign a
name to that park or

Kakadu National Park
was declared to be a park under that provision in 1979, and subsequently
identified as an area of universal
significance under the

[53] Under the
1975 Act, the Director was prohibited from selling,
leasing or otherwise disposing of land within a park or

Minister and the Parliament

legislation
; proclamations of
national parks and reserves made under the 1975 Act, including Kakadu National
Park, were continued as Commonwealth
reserves as if made under the

continued in existence as a body
. Under that regime,
when a Commonwealth reserve is declared by Proclamation, usage rights held or
later acquired by the Commonwealth
relating to the land or seabed vest in the
[55] However, that provision does not effect a true or complete transfer of
Commonwealth rights, in that usage rights prescribed by
regulations and usage
rights in respect of minerals do not vest in the Director. That provision
operates to deploy the Director
as a vehicle of the Commonwealth in dealings
with estates and other legal or equitable interests in Commonwealth reserves,
to the Commonwealth’s unfettered right to exclude estates and
interests of that type from the Director’s control and
the responsible
Minister’s power of direction (discussed further below). The close
relationship between the Director and the
Commonwealth, and the Ministerial
oversight characterising that relationship, is also reflected in the fact that
before a Commonwealth
reserve is either declared or revoked by Proclamation, the
Director must prepare a report on the matter for consideration by the
If a Commonwealth
reserve is revoked, usage rights held by the Director vest in the
Commonwealth.
[56] The Director’s functions under the
are broader
than under the 1975 Act, and include: (1) administering, managing and
controlling Commonwealth reserves and conservation
zones; (2) protecting,
conserving and managing biodiversity and heritage in Commonwealth reserves and
conservation zones; (3) cooperating
with any country in matters relating to the
establishment and management of national parks and nature reserves in that
country; (4)
carrying out research and investigations relevant to the
establishment and management of Commonwealth reserve; and (5) making
recommendations
to the Minister in relation to the establishment and management
of Commonwealth reserves.
[57] These are intrinsically executive governmental functions directed to the
stewardship and management of Commonwealth places, and,
in relation to one of
those functions, the maintenance of international relationships as a national
polity. In discharging those
functions the Director is clearly to pursue the
national or public interest, and to follow policies determined by the executive
government.
While it is no doubt correct to say that the Director exercises
statutory powers rather than an executive authority conferred directly
Constitution
, that statutory authority is conferred in
the exercise of the nationhood power and the Director’s function involves
the execution
and maintenance of the laws of the Commonwealth. The
incorporation of the Director is a convenient device by which the executive
government can exercise powers for the performance of those functions, including
the entry into property dealings and other contracts
with non-governmental
As the facts agreed
for the special case disclose, the Director is appointed by the executive
government, the Director is generally
subject to Ministerial control, the
conduct of the Director’s functions is essentially funded by the executive
government,
and the Director is accountable to the executive government in terms
of finances and other matters.
[58] A person is appointed as the Director by the Governor-General acting on
the advice of the Federal Executive Council, and on condition
that the Minister
is satisfied of the suitability of the proposed

That facility
illustrates the close nature of the relationship between the Director and the
federal executive government in both
policy and operational terms.
[60] The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Fund was established and
vested in the Director under the 1975 Act, and continued
. The Fund is
constituted by revenues raised through the Director’s activities, largely
in respect of leases, licences, permits
and other authorities granted in
relation to Commonwealth reserves, and any moneys appropriated by the Parliament
for the purposes
of the Department and allocated for the management of
Commonwealth reserves or conservation
It is also significant
for these purposes that those revenues and the Director’s property and
transactions are exempted from
Commonwealth and State taxation
Departmental funds
comprise the majority of the Director’s income, without which the Director
would not be able to perform
its functions and discharge its obligations. The
Director’s position in that respect may be contrasted with a
self-sustaining
commercial enterprise.
[61] Although revenues raised through the Director’s activities are
paid into the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Fund
rather than into the
Consolidated Revenue Fund, those revenues are co-mingled with moneys
appropriated by the Parliament and applied
for the discharge of the
Director’s governmental functions. In the application of those monies,
the Director remains accountable
to the federal executive government in terms of
financial control and related matters. The Director is a Commonwealth entity
the purposes of the
Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act
What this means
in practice is that the Director is subject to budgetary reporting and
government auditing requirements, and the
potential application of Government
Policy Orders. The designation of the Director as a ‘corporate
Commonwealth entity’
the purpose of that legislation is only to recognise that the Director has
separate legal personality. So far as operational
matters are concerned,
activities in Commonwealth reserves involving dealings with native species,
excavation, building activity,
other works and commercial activities may only be
undertaken in accordance with management plans prepared by the Director and
approved by the Minister with any modifications the Minister
considers appropriate.
[62] The Director must exercise its powers and perform its functions to give
effect to a management plan, and the Commonwealth and
Commonwealth agencies must
not perform functions or exercise powers inconsistently with a management
Contrary to the
submission of the Aboriginal parties, that does not create ‘a relevant
area of legal autonomy’. While
it is no doubt correct to say that the
effect of that provision is that the Minister cannot give a direction to the
Director inconsistent
with a management plan which is in place, that is not an
abrogation of the power of direction and the Minister may still give directions
which do not give rise to inconsistency. In any event, a management plan is a
document which is ultimately approved by the Minister,
rather than a mechanism
which denies Ministerial control over the Director.
[63] If a Commonwealth reserve includes indigenous land held under lease by
the Director, and a board has been established for the
joint management of the
reserve (as is the case with Kakadu National Park), any disagreement between the
Director and the relevant
land council over the implementation of the management
plan must be referred to the Minister for directions concerning the resolution
of that dispute.
Similarly, any
disagreement between the Director and the board over the implementation of the
management plan must be referred to
the Minister for
resolution.
Commonwealth reserve is on indigenous land, a board of management comprising a
majority of indigenous persons may participate
in the preparation of the
management plan, and any disagreement between a board of management and the
Director about the content
of a management plan is ultimately resolved by the
[64] The Management Plan
is a legislative instrument made by the
and also recognises
that the Director forms an integral part of the Australian Government. The
Management Plan details the involvement
of the Australian Government and the
Commonwealth Parliament in the establishment of the park, and in particular the
arrangement
made for the traditional owners to lease land granted to them to the
Australian Government for management as a national
That preamble draws no
distinction between the Australian Government and the Director in those
arrangements. By way of further
example, Table 1 in the Management Plan
comprises the ‘Kakadu National Park – Values
Statement’.
to that Statement incorporates the Commonwealth Coat of Arms and signifies the
‘Director of National Parks’
as part of the Australian Government.
The Management Plan makes explicit that the park is managed by the Director in
conjunction
with the traditional owners, and that the Director is assisted in
that task ‘by Parks Australia, whose staff are employees
of the Department
of the Environment’.
The objective of the joint management arrangement is expressed to be that,
‘[t]he park is managed through a strong and successful
partnership between
Bininj/Mungguy and the Australian Government (as represented by the Director of
National Parks), and Bininj/Mungguy
satisfy their aspirations for benefits from
landownership’.
[65] Those statutory provisions and indicia lead necessarily to the
conclusion that the intention of the statutory scheme is for the
Commonwealth to
administer, manage and control Commonwealth reserves through the Director,
rather than for the incorporation of the
Director to perform its functions
independently of the Commonwealth. It follows that the legislative intention is
for the Director
to enjoy the privileges and immunities of the federal executive
government, including the presumption against the imposition of criminal
liability, except to the extent that they are withdrawn or modified under the
statutory scheme. That conclusion is reinforced by
the Director’s
integration into the machinery of the federal executive government, the
Director’s subjection to Ministerial
direction, the Director’s
financial dependence upon funding from the federal executive government for the
performance of its
functions, the nexus between those functions and Commonwealth
places, and the Director’s immunity from taxation imposts.

intention and operation of the Parliament
is otherwise to impose criminal
liability on the Director under the narrowly defined offence provisions in the

operation is not to subject the Director to the criminal law generally, and

in assessing the potential impacts of proposed actions
in the management of the
park behalf of the Commonwealth, they do not evince an intention that the
Director is not subject to the
usual presumption against the imposition of
criminal liability on executive government, and they have nothing to say about
the subject matter, purpose and policy of the
Sacred Sites Act
demonstrates an intention to impose criminal liability on the executive of the
Commonwealth. So far as the provisions of the Management
Plan requiring an
Authority Certificate are concerned, they are capable of application to a wide
range of private entities and do
not resolve the question of whether the
Sacred Sites Act
imposes that requirement on the Director, including
criminal sanction for breach of that requirement.
[69] Having regard to that legislative and functional structure, the Director
is an instrumentality or authority intended to have
the same legal status as the
executive government of the Commonwealth in relation to the imposition of
criminal liability by a statute
enacted by the legislature of another
Accepting that to be
so, that s 34(1) of the
Sacred Sites Act
attaches criminal liability
to a ‘person’ and a ‘body corporate’, and is therefore
capable in its terms of
application to the Director, is not determinative of
whether the Director may bear criminal liability under that provision. The
legal status of the Director requires an anterior determination of whether the
Sacred Sites Act
evinces an intention to impose criminal liability on the
executive government of the Commonwealth.
The legislative intent of the
Sacred Sites Act
[70] It may be accepted that s 4(1) of the
Sacred Sites Act
providing that ‘[t]his Act binds the Territory Crown and, to the extent
the legislative power of the Legislative Assembly
permits, the Crown in all its
other capacities’, evinces an intention to rebut the full scope of the
presumption that the statute
does not apply to the executive government of the
Northern Territory of Australia, or to instrumentalities and authorities having
the same legal status. However, that statement of legislative intention is not
conclusive of the question whether there is a legislative
intention to impose
liability on the executive, including government instrumentalities and
authorities, of the Commonwealth. As
the New South Wales Court of Appeal stated
AGU v Commonwealth of Australia (No 2)
in relation to the operation of
a provision in similar terms:
The principle to be extracted from these authorities is that such a
provision, while effective to rebut the general presumption that
a statute does
not bind the government which passed it, will be a factor, not necessarily
determinative, in determining whether specific
provisions apply in relation to
other bodies politic.
[71] That statement reflects the presumption, already described, that
legislation of the enacting jurisdiction does not bind the Crown
in right of
other polities in the
federation;
and also reflects
that the specific provisions of the legislation must be considered to determine
whether on proper construction
they do indicate a general displacement of the
presumption.
[72] Quite apart from the question of whether that general statement of
intention is sufficient to displace the presumption that the
legislation of the
enacting policy is not intended to bind the executive governments of other
polities, there is also the question
of whether a general formulation of that
criminal liability
on the Commonwealth executive. As the preceding discussion
of the authorities demonstrates, while a provision or scheme may evince
requisite intention to subject the executive of another polity to civil
consequences, it may not be apt do so in relation to
criminal liability. So it
Telstra Corporation Ltd v Worthing
that New South Wales
legislation expressed to bind the Crown ‘in all its other
capacities’ was not sufficient to subject
the Commonwealth to criminal
That was said to
require the clearest indication of a legislative purpose that the penal
provisions attached to the Commonwealth.
[73] Section 4(2) of the
Sacred Sites Act
goes on to provide that
if the Territory Crown ‘in any of its capacities’ commits an offence
against the Act, the Territory
Crown is liable in that capacity to be prosecuted
as if it were a body corporate. On one reading, that provision tells against
suggestion of a legislative intention to impose prohibitions attracting
criminal sanction on the executive of another polity. There
is no mention in
that provision of criminal liability on the part of any other executive
government and its instrumentalities. On
another possible reading, the
provision is merely facilitative in allowing the Territory and any Territory
authority or instrumentality
which commits an offence against the Act to be
prosecuted as if it was a body corporate. However, if that is the purpose
to be attributed to the provision, it would seem otiose in circumstances
where the offence created by s 34 of the
Sacred Sites Act
conduct by a ‘person’, and the
Interpretation Act 1978
defines ‘person’ to include a body politic and a body corporate.
[74] The proposition that s 4(2) of the
Sacred Sites Act
intended to impose criminal liability on the Territory Crown, and not on the
executives of other polities, receives support from
the legislative history and
the extrinsic material. The provision was enacted as part of the
Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Amendment Act 2005
(NT). Prior to that
enactment, s 4 of the
Sacred Sites Act
provided only:
This Act binds the Crown not only in right of the Territory but, to the
extent that the legislative power of the Legislative Assembly
so permits, in all
its other capacities.
[75] The amending legislation operated to insert subs 4(2), (3) and (4)
Sacred Sites Act
as they now stand. In the second reading speech
for the amending legislation, the responsible Minister described the purpose of
those amendments in the following terms:
... the basis for deterrence against contravention of the
Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act
remains in the authority’s
ability to bring successful prosecutions.
In the Territory, government agencies and authorities undertake a significant
proportion of works for roads, infrastructure and development.
disappointing to note that, despite encouraging forms in the monitoring systems
of agencies, a percentage of reported sacred
sites damage has been caused as a
result of actions or approvals by government agencies and authorities. In recent
cases of alleged
site damage by the government agencies or authorities, it has
become apparent that there is a lack of clarity in the liability of
the Crown to
be prosecuted for breaches of the
Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites
, or accordingly, some prosecutions have not been pursued despite
sufficient evidence. The inability to prosecute the Crown for sacred
site damage
and thus seek a form of reparation is a source of dissatisfaction amongst both
authority members and the Aboriginal custodians.
The bill provides an
appropriate capacity to prosecute the Crown by clarifying that. If the Crown, in
any of its capacities, commits
an offence against the
Northern Territory
Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act
, then it is liable in that capacity. The Crown
includes agencies, authorities and instrumentalities of the Crown and, the
liability of an officer, employee or agent of the Crown to be
prosecuted for an offence is not affected.
[76] The explanatory memorandum provided relevantly:
This clause repeals
Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred
and substitutes it with a new
which clarifies the extent
to which that Act binds the Crown, and specifically the liability of the Crown
to prosecution for offences
under that Act.
[77] That purpose and intention is achieved by the insertion of s 4(2)
Sacred Sites Act
, providing that if the Territory Crown ‘in
any of its capacities’ commits an offence against the Act, the Territory
is liable to be prosecuted. Section 4(3) of the
Sacred Sites
goes on to provide that the section ‘does not affect any liability
of an officer, employee or agent of the Territory Crown
to be prosecuted for an
offence’ under the
Sacred Sites Act
. By way of definition,
s 4(4) of the
Sacred Sites Act
provides that the 'Territory Crown'
means the Crown in right of the Territory and includes an
, authority or
instrumentality of the Territory Crown. Read together, those provisions treat
Agencies, authorities and instrumentalities
of the Territory Crown differently
to officers, employees and agents of the Territory Crown in the subjection to
criminal liability.
In particular, the extension of criminal liability has
application only to the ‘Territory Crown’ as defined, leaving
position of an officer, employee or agent of the Territory in relation to
criminal liability unaffected. This is reflective
of the distinction between
the legal status of Crown instrumentalities, on the one hand, and the legal
status of employees, agents,
contractors and other natural persons, on the other
hand, in the application of the presumption against the imposition of criminal
[78] The express purpose and intention of the amending legislation, at least
in the subjective sense, was to clarify the liability
of the Crown to be
prosecuted for offences against the legislation. The amendments acknowledged
that s 4 of the
Sacred Sites Act
as it was originally expressed did
not evince a sufficiently clear objective intention to impose criminal liability
on the Crown,
which in turn recognises the strength of the presumption in that
respect. However, the legislative response to that uncertainty
was to impose
criminal liability on the Territory Crown in terms of irresistible clearness.
At the same time, there was no attempt
to clarify matters by imposing criminal
liability on the executive governments of other polities in the federation in
similar terms.
In other words, and to adopt the formulation from the
explanatory memorandum, ‘the extent’ to which it was intended
render the Crown liable to prosecution for offences against the Act was
‘the Territory Crown in any of its capacities’.
The only available
conclusion is that there was no intention to impose criminal liability on other
polities in the federation.
[79] The fact that the Northern Territory is conferred with authority under
s 73 of the
Land Rights Act
to make laws for ‘the protection
of, and the prevention of the desecration of, sacred sites in the Northern
Territory, including
sites on Aboriginal land’ on the proviso that such
laws are capable of operating concurrently with Commonwealth laws, including
, does not mean that s 34(1) of the
Sacred Sites Act
is intended to attach criminal liability to the Director. In its relevant
operation, s 73 of the
Land Rights Act
is a conferral of legislative
authority on the Northern Territory with an acknowledgement of the already
subsisting constitutional
restriction that laws made in the exercise of that
authority cannot be inconsistent with or repugnant to Commonwealth
The submission that
there is a ‘rational integration’ between the
Sacred Sites Act
unduly elevates that recognition of the
constitutional restriction. If anything, that recognition draws attention to
the primacy
of the Commonwealth management regime. The grant of legislative
authority in those terms does not obviate a consideration of whether
enacted in the exercise of that authority is intended to impose criminal
liability on the Commonwealth executive.
[80] Nor does advertence to
and the general intention of the
heritage legislation under consideration in that case assist in the resolution
of the present question.
As already observed, the decision in
concerned with the imposition of criminal liability on the agents of the
executive of the enacting polity rather than the executive
of another polity;
and the finding in
was only that by necessary implication the
criminal offence provision in the heritage legislation applied indifferently to
persons having regard to the subject matter, disclosed policy and
purpose of that particular legislation. Even accepting that the
Sacred Sites
applies to all sacred sites irrespective of where they are found or
situated in the Northern Territory, and that it applies to Crown
land, it is not
possible to make the necessary implication that it is intended to impose
criminal liability on the Commonwealth executive
given the very deliberate
legislative choice made to limit the imposition of criminal liability to the
Territory Crown which has
been described above. Had the legislature intended to
expand the imposition of criminal liability to other polities, it would have
been easy to include a reference to the Crown in all its capacities in
s 4(2) of the
Sacred Sites Act
, as was done in s 4(1). The
failure to take that step reveals a reasonably clear legislative intention that
the executive authorities
and instrumentalities of other polities were not
intended to be covered.
[81] The cumulative effect of these considerations outweighs the general
statement in s 4(1) of the
Sacred Sites Act
, common to many modern
statutes, that the Act seeks to bind the Crown in right of the enacting polity
and, to the extent the legislative
power of the legislature permits, the Crown
in all its other capacities. While that provision may be effective in
subjecting Commonwealth
authorities and instrumentalities to injunction,
mandamus and ordinary civil remedies, as a matter of statutory construction it
not impose a criminal liability on the Director. To the extent that this
conclusion might be said to immunise Commonwealth authorities
instrumentalities from criminal liability under the
Sacred Sites Act
that will depend in every case on whether on proper characterisation of the
instrumentality’s legal status it is entitled
to that immunity. It is
also an immunity which the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly may remove by
the enactment of legislation
in sufficiently clear terms (subject to any
question of inconsistency or repugnancy).
Constitutional intergovernmental immunity
[82] That finding makes it strictly unnecessary to determine whether the
offence and penalty prescribed by s 34(1) of the
Sacred Sites Act
not apply to the Director of National Parks because that application would be
beyond the authority of the Legislative Assembly
of the Northern
However, we will
go on to consider that question lest we are wrong in our conclusion that the
Cain v Doyle
presumption is capable of applying to the Director as a
statutory corporation.
[83] The argument put by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth in this
respect is, in essence, that the legislative power of the
Northern Territory of
Australia does not exceed that of the States in terms of binding the
Commonwealth; and that the constitutionally
implied immunity of the Commonwealth
from certain State laws
extends to Territory laws which would in substance prohibit the exercise of the
capacities of the Commonwealth. The
Sacred Sites Act
is said to be such
a law in its relevant operation. This argument may be dealt with in relatively
short order.
[84] First, the
Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978
Self-Government Act
) established the Northern Territory of
Australia as a body politic under the Crown (s 5), the Legislative Assembly
(s 13), the office
of the Administrator (s 32) and the Executive
Council of the Northern Territory comprising the persons for the time being
Ministerial office (s 33); and conferred duties, powers, functions
and authorities upon the Legislative Assembly and these other
institutions.
As part of the
establishment of the self-governing body politic, s 6 of the
Self-Government Act
confers on the Legislative Assembly the power ‘to
make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory’.
exercise of legislative power by the Legislative Assembly is not an exercise of
the Commonwealth Parliament’s legislative
the Legislative
Assembly is not an agent or delegate of the
Parliament;
legislative authority is of the same quality as that enjoyed by the legislatures
of the States.
[85] Secondly, the doctrine expressed in
qualified in
is founded on the principle that the legislative powers of the States do not
extend to the destruction, modification or qualification
of the capacities of
the Crown in right of the Commonwealth. That principle is not simply the
obverse or counterpart of the principle
upon which the decision in
Corporation
Melbourne Corporation
principle prohibits Commonwealth laws which
discriminate by placing special burdens or disabilities on the States, or which
to destroy or curtail the continued existence of the States or their
capacity to function as
governments.
On the other
hand, the qualified
doctrine will operate to invalidate State
laws which purport to modify or restrict a power granted to the Commonwealth by
Commonwealth
law or a prerogative power conferred by the
Constitution
basis that such a law would be offensive to
Constitution
[86] Thirdly, leaving aside questions of inconsistency and repugnancy, the
Commonwealth and its instrumentalities may be bound by
Northern Territory
legislation
just as they may
be bound by State
legislation
. The position of
the Northern Territory in this respect may be distinguished from that of the
Australian Capital Territory, which
is subject to an express provision that its
statutes cannot bind the Commonwealth except where otherwise provided in the
regulations.
However, the
legislative authority of the Northern Territory is necessarily subject to the
implication arising from
Constitution
that the exercise
of that authority may not impinge on, or attempt to detract from, the
Commonwealth’s capacities or prerogative
powers. That implication is not
displaced or obviated by the fact that
Constitution
confers plenary legislative authority on the Commonwealth in relation to the
Northern Territory. To say that the Commonwealth has
legislative capacity to
displace any Northern Territory law which restricts Commonwealth executive
capacity does not answer the question
of whether the Northern Territory has
legislative authority to enact such a law.
[87] Fourthly, the constitutionally implied immunity of the Commonwealth
extends to its statutory authorities and instrumentalities
to the extent that in
carrying out their functions they are acting in the exercise of the executive
capacity of the Commonwealth.
On one analysis, that requires only that the
authority or instrumentality is in its activities exercising the executive power
the Commonwealth vested mediately under
Constitution
but on another analysis it requires that the authority or instrumentality is so
practically identified with a Commonwealth department
as to be indistinguishable
[88] Fifthly, a distinction is to be drawn between the immunity enjoyed by
the capacities and functions of the Crown in right of the
Commonwealth, and the
application of State and Territory laws to transactions in which the
Commonwealth may choose to engage in the
exercise of those capacities and
functions. Although the States and Territories have no legislative authority to
modify a grant
of executive power conferred on an executive government
instrumentality by a law of the Commonwealth, they do have legislative authority
to regulate transactions and activities into which the Commonwealth
instrumentality may choose to enter. Once the Commonwealth has
exercised a
choice to enter into a transaction or activity, its executive power is not
affected merely because the incidents of the
transaction or activity are
prescribed by a State or Territory law. That recognises the distinction between
legislation which purports
to modify the executive capacities of the
Commonwealth and legislation which merely seeks to regulate activities in which
the Commonwealth
may choose to engage in the exercise of those
capacities.
By authorising a
department, authority or instrumentality to carry out an activity, in the
absence of a contrary indication the
Parliament recognises that the Executive is
to be bound by the common law rules and statutes applying in the States and
Territories.
[89] Accordingly, the operation of the immunity is limited to State and
Territory laws which purport to alter the Commonwealth’s
unique executive
capacities, or which otherwise operate differentially upon the Commonwealth
compared to its subjects. Section 34
Sacred Sites Act
carrying out work on or using a sacred site except as permitted by a
Certificate. On the assumption that the provision
imposes a requirement on the
Director, in making that provision the
Sacred Sites Act
does nothing to
alter or deny the functions or capacities of the Director to the extent that it
is acting in the exercise of the
executive capacity of the Commonwealth,
notwithstanding that the law might regulate the Director’s activities in
relation to
sacred sites as it regulates the same activities on the part of
others. It is a Northern Territory law of general application which
govern an activity into which the Director chooses to enter in the exercise of
its functions and capacities.
[90] That characterisation is not changed by the fact that the requirement to
obtain a Certificate arises in the Director’s
management of the Park.
That requirement does not subtract from the Commonwealth’s executive
power, but rather regulates its
exercise in a very narrow and specific aspect.
That is so regardless of whether the executive power in question is
characterised
as the exercise of the nationhood power conferred directly by
Constitution
or the exercise of power conferred by
Commonwealth law. Even leaving the scope of the regulation aside, there can be
no subtraction
in circumstances where the executive authority conferred on the
Director is limited by the requirement in the Management Plan for
an Authority
Certificate in respect of any action with potential impact upon a sacred site.
[91] For these reasons, the law is not beyond the legislative power of the
Legislative Assembly; but that is a question different
to whether the law binds
the Director as a matter of statutory construction.

That conclusion has nothing
necessarily to say about the criminal liability of employees and contractors of
the Director: cf
Wurridjal v Commonwealth
(2009) 237 CLR 309
[164]-[165]. The plurality in
distinguish between Crown
instrumentalities and employees or agents. Although rule of law presumptions
and considerations may weigh
against immunity from criminal liability for
employees and other natural persons, they do not weigh against immunity for
corporations which on proper characterisation enjoy the legal status
of the Commonwealth for that purpose.
