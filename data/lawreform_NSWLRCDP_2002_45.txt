Discussion Paper 45 (2002) - Apprehended Violence Orders: Part 15A of the Crimes Act
1. Introduction
History of this reference (Digest)
Terminology
The current law
The Commission’s review
1.1 The prevention, detection and punishment of violence in all its forms has been a pressing matter on social, political and law
reform agendas for many years. The focus of the criminal law is to punish the offender after the commission of an offence has been
proved beyond reasonable doubt. While the imposition of criminal sanctions following a breach of the law is a necessary element in
our society, it is not always sufficient to protect those who fear for their safety. A person may fear violence at the hands of another
in circumstances where the conduct of that person may either not amount to criminal conduct, or may not be able to be proved to the
criminal standard. A classic example is obsessive behaviour, such as constant telephone calls or sending disturbing, unsolicited
gifts or messages. In domestic situations, it is possible for patterns of intimidation and abuse to continue for years without there
being enough corroborating evidence to support a criminal conviction. To alleviate fear in these circumstances, a system of restraining
or protection orders operates in every Australian State and Territory, and in many overseas jurisdictions. In NSW, they are known
as Apprehended Violence Orders (“AVOs”), and are contained in
Crimes Act 1900
”). As the name suggests, these orders are intended to act as a circuit breaker, to apprehend or prevent existing or potentially
violent situations from escalating.
1.2 Since the introduction of AVOs in NSW 20 years ago, the number of applications has increased dramatically.
While AVOs originated as a means of preventing domestic violence,
they are now able to be sought generally, regardless of whether the applicant and defendant are in a domestic relationship. Because
of the surge in the number of AVO applications, and the fact that they deal with sensitive and controversial subject matter, AVO
legislation has been reviewed and amended several times over the years. These are detailed in Chapter 2. In the latest round of legislative
amendments, a provision was included requiring a review of
to determine whether the policy objectives of the Part remain valid, and whether the terms of the Part remain appropriate for securing
those objectives.
The Commission has been asked to conduct that review.
TERMINOLOGY
1.3 Throughout this Discussion Paper, the Commission refers to the person who applies for an AVO, or on whose behalf an AVO is applied
for by a police officer, as the “applicant”. The person against whom an AVO is taken out is referred to as the “defendant”.
The term “AVO” is a general one used to refer to the protection orders available under
However, in practice, people are granted either an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (“ADVO”) or an Apprehended Personal
Violence Order (“APVO”), depending on the relationship between the applicant and defendant. There are some differences
in the way Part 15A applies to each type of order, but largely the procedural elements and requirements are the same for each. Consequently,
the Commission uses the terms “ADVO” and “APVO” when discussing the provisions peculiar to each type of order,
but uses the general term “AVO” to discuss provisions common to both. This reflects the terminology and structure of
THE CURRENT LAW
1.4 AVOs are the primary legal means by which people may seek protection against threatened acts of personal violence.
AVOs can be obtained relatively quickly and easily.
Under Part 15A, any person may apply to the local court
, for an order against another person if he or she suspects that some form of personal violence, or other abuse, harassment or intimidation,
is occurring or is imminent. A police officer may apply for an AVO on behalf of an applicant, and
apply for an order where the officer suspects that a domestic violence offence
or a stalking offence
has been, or is likely to be, committed, or where the applicant is under the age of 16 years.
1.5 As noted above, the applicant will seek either an ADVO and APVO, depending on the relationship he or she has with the defendant.
An application for an ADVO may be made where the applicant and the defendant are in a domestic relationship.
A domestic relationship is defined as one where the applicant and defendant:
are or were married or in a de facto (including same sex) relationship;
are or were in an intimate personal relationship (whether or not there is a sexual element);
share or have shared a household or residential facility;
are or were in a relationship involving dependence or ongoing care (paid or unpaid); or
are or have been relatives.
Where the applicant and defendant are in a relationship other than a domestic one, the applicant must apply for an APVO.
1.6 The order may be granted if the defendant consents,
or if the court is satisfied that a person, on the balance of probabilities, has reasonable grounds to fear, and does in fact fear:
the commission of a personal violence offence;
conduct amounting to harassment or molestation, being conduct sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to warrant the making of the
conduct which is either intimidating or amounts to stalking.
1.7 Legal aid may be available for an ADVO applicant,
but not for an ADVO defendant,
and is not available at all in relation to APVO proceedings. After an application for an AVO is made, the defendant is notified by
the court issuing either a summons or a warrant for the purpose of bringing the defendant to court.
An AVO may be made on an interim or a final basis, and regardless of whether the defendant is present in court or not. The AVO will
take effect when the order is served on the defendant. It can remain in force for as long as necessary
and may be varied or revoked upon application to, and agreement by, the court.
An AVO may contain “such prohibitions or restrictions on the behaviour of the defendant as appears necessary or desirable to
the court”.
Despite its location in the
, the AVO process is not a criminal one, and the defendant will not incur a criminal record. However, a
of an AVO constitutes a criminal offence.
1.8 AVOs have generated considerable controversy. Some of the heated debates have erupted because of the nature of the subject matter:
in dealing with violence in domestic and other personal relationships, they touch on raw and sensitive issues which are extremely
complex in themselves, quite apart from any legal or policy considerations surrounding the AVO process. Other issues touch on more
practical or procedural matters which will be examined by the Commission in this Paper and over the course of the review.
1.9 For example, some argue that AVOs place restrictions on defendants that can be quite onerous, yet an AVO may be granted in a matter
of minutes without the defendant being present, and may be based on little evidence. It is also alleged that the relative ease of
obtaining an AVO, based on the balance of probabilities rather than the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt, exposes the
provisions to a greater risk of abuse: that is, there is considerable scope to use the provisions inappropriately or even maliciously.
Alternatively, others argue that the focus of AVOs should be on protecting people against future acts of violence, not on the “rights”
of the defendant, and for AVOs to be obtained on the basis of anything other than the lower standard of proof would defeat their
purpose of preventing future conduct rather than acting as a sanction for past misdemeanors.
Some commentators have suggested that the real “abuse” regarding AVOs is that the law is not enforced or implemented
THE COMMISSION’S REVIEW
The Commission’s approach
1.10 The Terms of Reference for the Commission’s review arise from the requirement in section 562Z of the
, inserted by the
Crimes Amendment (Apprehended Violence) Act 1999
(NSW), to examine the validity of the policy objectives of Part 15A and to determine if the provisions of that Part remain appropriate
for securing those objectives. In assessing the validity of those objectives, the Commission’s focus is on the effect of the
most recent legislative amendments in 1999, and on the issues raised in past reviews, or brought to our attention through consultations,
which may help to further or hinder the policy objectives of Part 15A.
1.11 In order to meet its Terms of Reference, the Commission considers that the following questions need to be addressed:
(1) What are the stated and implied policy objectives?
(2) What are the barometers that measure the validity, success or otherwise of those objectives?
(3) What do we know about the operation of Part 15A, from consultation, research and statistics?
(4) Applying the criteria for success (identified in 2 above) to what we know about Part 15A, what issues emerge as the main strengths
and weaknesses of the legislation?
(5) How can Part 15A operate more effectively to meet the policy objectives of the legislation?
These questions form the basis of the Commission’s review and underpin our approach in this Discussion Paper.
Major issues canvassed
1.12 In Chapter 2, the Commission traces the legislative history of AVOs, and discusses the most relevant recent reviews of Part 15A.
This discussion provides the context for attempting to identify the broad policy objectives of AVOs in general, and Part 15A in particular.
The Commission examines the validity and effectiveness of those objectives, and asks whether AVOs are effective as a method of preventing
physical violence and mental or emotional abuse.
One of the major barriers to the effectiveness, or the perceived effectiveness of AVOs, is allegations that they are being sought
and used inappropriately. The Commission looks at this issue in Chapter 5, and seeks suggestions for amending the legislation to
limit the possibility of AVOs being abused.
1.13 The scope of AVO legislation, for example, whether it should apply only to domestic violence, and whether ADVOs and APVOs should
be dealt with separately or together, have been a recurring theme in legislative reviews and amendments. In Chapter 6, the Commission
discusses the separation between ADVOs and APVOs that resulted from the 1999 amendments and asks how that has worked in practice,
and whether that separation should be taken further. A related issue is whether the
is the appropriate statute in which to locate AVO provisions, given that they do not actually involve the criminal law unless they
are breached.
The Commission also examines the adequacy of the definitions of “domestic violence”, “personal violence”
and “domestic relationship” in
chp1_31" name="FNBdp45chp1_31">31
1.14 For AVOs to be truly effective, they must be accessible. The procedure for applying for AVOs is discussed in Chapter 8.
is framed so that it applies equally to all people who fear personal violence. Yet, the practical application of the provisions may
not affect everyone equally. Chapter 9 examines the impact of AVO legislation on the more marginalised groups in society, including
Aboriginal communities, people with disabilities (particularly intellectual disabilities), people living in rural or regional areas,
children and older people.
1.15 The Commission also looks at the provisions of
which deal with granting an AVO,
the consequences that follow the issuing and breach of an AVO for both the applicant and the defendant,
and other practical issues such as the appeals process.
1.16 The final issue considered by the Commission in this paper is the offence of stalking and intimidation.
Although not directly part of the AVO process, the substantive criminal offence of stalking and intimidation is contained in
It is therefore necessary for the Commission to determine whether these provisions remain appropriate for securing the policy objectives
of the Part. Stalking and intimidation is also relevant to AVOs as a ground on which an order may be sought, and a prohibition against
stalking and intimidation is a standard term of every AVO unless otherwise ordered.
Inherent difficulties in the review of AVOs
1.17 The Commission’s brief is to review the validity of the policy objectives in
As the primary objective is to prevent violence, it is difficult,
prima facie
, to deny its validity. Yet, the real test of whether the policy objectives remain valid is not in the abstract, but in how effectively
they work in practice to prevent violence. Assessing this is more difficult than it sounds, due to the nature of AVOs and the behaviour
they are designed to address. AVOs are preventative measures: they are granted based on indications of past behaviour but essentially
go to preventing future conduct. It is difficult to say for certain whether AVOs prevent future conduct, since that conduct may or
may not have occurred anyway, irrespective of the AVO.
1.18 Another difficulty involves the nature of the violent behaviour AVOs are intended to prevent, particularly domestic violence.
There is a significant amount of written material asserting that the incidence of domestic violence is vastly under-reported to police.
Assuming this to be true, any study of the effectiveness of AVOs and the validity of the policy objectives must be seen in that light:
they can only be measured against the people who have been able to access the “system”.
1.19 Violence prevention is a complex issue, requiring a comprehensive response extending beyond legislation.
is only one element among many which need to work together to prevent violence. Any evidence that violence is not being effectively
prevented could point to the need for better implementation of the legislation, for more legal or community support services, or
greater community education, rather than faults with
1.20 The Commission makes these observations at this initial stage of its review not to pre-empt any findings, but to note the context
in which it is happening and the limits of what it can do.
Preliminary consultations
1.21 In addition to researching legislation, articles and reports pertinent to AVOs, the Commission has conducted a number of preliminary
consultations with particular groups and individuals in Sydney and regional NSW, with a view to isolating the most relevant issues
for discussion in this Paper. Those consulted include: a number of Magistrates and Chamber Magistrates; the Family Law Reform Association;
Domestic Violence Liaison Officers and staff of the Domestic Violence Court Assistance Scheme; the Domestic Violence Advocacy Service;
the Violence Against Women Unit in the NSW Attorney General’s Department, NSW Police and various solicitors.
1.22 The Commission has also obtained the latest available statistics relating to AVOs from the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research,
and has observed at meetings of the Apprehended Violence Legal Issues Co-ordinating Committee.
Our need for feedback
1.23 The preliminary consultations have helped the Commission isolate some relevant issues regarding
, but have not yet led to definitive conclusions. In order to gauge the effectiveness of
, the Commission needs to know how the provisions operate in practice. This Discussion Paper is designed to promote discussion and
generate responses to the policy and procedural issues surrounding AVOs. The Commission would like to receive submissions from any
interested person or group on the issues raised in this paper, or other issues which impact on the effectiveness or otherwise of
the AVO provisions, and any suggested improvements to the legislation. The feedback from those submissions, together with further
consultation and research, will form the basis of our final recommendations in a Report to be delivered in early 2003.

Part 15A is divided into sections: Division 1A contains the objects and provisions specific to ADVOs, while Division 1B contains
the APVO provisions. Divisions 2-5 deal with the procedural requirements relating to AVOs generally.
It should be noted that protection orders do not, and should not, act as a replacement for the laying of criminal charges in cases
of violence, abuse, stalking or harassment.
Providing speedy, inexpensive, safe and simple access to justice is one way that Part 15A, Division 1 (dealing with ADVOs) aims to
achieve its objects. The ease with which AVOs may be obtained is a controversial issue, and is discussed throughout this Discussion

physical or mental harm: s 562AB(4).

The defendant may consent to the AVO without admitting the veracity of the claims upon which the application is based:

It is not necessary for the person actually to fear the commission of a personal violence offence where the person is under the age
of 16 years, or is, in the opinion of the court, appreciably below general intelligence level:
s 562AE(2) and s 562AI(2).
Personal violence offence is defined in
to include offences such as murder, manslaughter, malicious wounding and damage, sexual assault, indecent assault, assault with or
without inflicting actual bodily harm, and breaching an AVO.
Conduct may amount to harassment or molestation even though it does not involve actual or threatened violence to the person, or consists

Previous reviews
2.1 This chapter sets out the background to and context of the Commission’s review. It traces the legislative development
of AVOs and discusses the changing policy emphasis over the last 20 years. It also looks at laws which impact on, and are affected
by, AVO legislation, and the most recent reviews of
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY
2.2 A consideration of the legislative history of AVOs helps to shed some light on the impetus for a scheme of protection orders,
and the policy principles and objectives on which the scheme is based.
The situation before AVOs
2.3 Prior to 1982, there was limited protection available for people who feared that they would become victims of violent activity
in the immediate future. While the general criminal law prohibited personal violence offences, doubts emerged as to whether the criminal
law alone was sufficient to deter violence in interpersonal relationships.
Domestic violence, in particular, has traditionally had a low prosecution rate. Many theories and studies abound as to the possible
reasons for this, including low levels of reporting by victims of violence to authorities,
attitudes to domestic violence held by the community, the police and the criminal justice system which prevent it being taken seriously,
and difficult evidentiary and other issues associated with the hidden nature of domestic violence.
2.4 Aside from these difficulties, the criminal law of course only applied after the violence had occurred and conviction could only
be secured if the offence were proved beyond reasonable doubt. Consequently, this did little to deter future violence. The criminal
law also could not operate to prevent conduct, such as harassment, which did not amount to a crime.
2.5 The main method, not involving a criminal element, by which potential victims of violence could seek protection prior to the introduction
of AVOs was a recognisance to “keep the peace” under the
Section 547
provided for a defendant to be brought before a Court of Petty Sessions, either by means of a summons or a warrant for arrest issued
by a Magistrate, where a person, or a police officer, had accused the defendant of threatening behaviour. If the Magistrate were
satisfied that the defendant had committed, threatened to commit, or was likely to commit, a violent act, the Magistrate could require
the defendant to enter into a recognisance (or undertaking) to keep the peace or be of good behaviour. Unlike the current AVO scheme,
a recognisance order could not be tailored to include specific conditions such as preventing the defendant from contacting the applicant.
More significantly, breach of an undertaking did not constitute a criminal offence, and there was consequently no power to arrest
a defendant who breached a recognisance.
As a result, that procedure was widely criticised at the time for being inflexible, unenforceable and ineffective.
2.6 In response to the perceived failings of the existing law, and the emergence of domestic violence as a significant social issue
in the 1980s,
a Task Force on Domestic Violence was established in 1981. That Task Force made 187 recommendations to the then Premier, the Hon
Neville Wran QC MP, including suggestions for legislative reform. Those suggestions were incorporated into the resulting legislation:
Crimes (Domestic Violence) Amendment Act 1982
(NSW) (“the 1982 amendments”), which among other things, clarified and enhanced police powers of entry into premises for
the purpose of investigating domestic violence offences,
and initiated a scheme of protection orders, later to be known as AVOs.
The Crimes (Domestic Violence) Amendment Act 1982
2.7 The 1982 amendments supplemented s 547 of the
by inserting a new s 547AA, empowering a Magistrate to make orders which restricted or prohibited the behaviour of people whose domestic
violence was apprehended. Those orders could provide for certain conditions to be imposed on the defendant, including restricting
or prohibiting the defendant from approaching the applicant or from accessing specified premises, depending on the circumstances.
A procedure for making applications for orders based on a complaint by a private applicant or a police officer was established, with
the complaint needing to be substantiated only by the civil (balance of probabilities) rather than the criminal standard of proof.
The orders could last for up to six months, and failure to comply with the orders became a criminal offence (arrest being permitted
without a warrant) carrying a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment.
2.8 The 1982 amendments applied only to physical violence between married and heterosexual de facto couples, with orders being known
as Apprehended Domestic Violence Orders (“ADVOs”).
When introducing the legislation into Parliament, the then Premier, the Hon Neville Wran, QC MP, referred to the Government’s
determination to eliminate the “scourge” of domestic violence,
the inadequacy of the existing law in leaving victims, particularly women, who fear violence “out on a limb”,
and the impact he hoped the new law would have:
For the tens of thousands of women from every social and economic spectrum in New South Wales who are subjected repeatedly to domestic
violence the reforms which I am presenting to this Parliament today are undoubtedly among the most important reforms it will ever
Amendments since 1982
2.9 The AVO provisions have been amended a number of times since 1982, generally to expand their scope and availability.
Crimes (Domestic Violence) Amendment Act 1983
(NSW) extended the application of the ADVO provisions in s 547AA of the
to include separated heterosexual de facto and divorced spouses, who were seen as a “significant category of potential victims
of domestic violence”.
Further, ADVOs were able to be made where there was an apprehension of sufficiently serious molestation or harassment which falls
short of actual physical violence. Both of these amendments implemented recommendations made by the NSW Law Reform Commission.
The 1983 Act also enabled the court to impose a fine of up to $2000 in addition to a term of imprisonment as a punishment for breach
of the ADVO provisions, and clarified the application of the
Bail Act 1978
(NSW) in relation to ADVOs.
2.11 Another round of amendments was passed in 1987. The
Crimes (Personal and Family Violence) Amendment Act 1987
(NSW) created
, replacing s 547AA. The category of people eligible to apply for ADVOs was extended to include those who lived or had lived in the
same house (apart from a tenant or boarder), and people in existing or former intimate personal relationships.
In addition, the six month time limit on the duration of ADVOs, imposed in the 1982 amendments, was removed, as it was considered
that six months was not long enough in many domestic situations to remove the threat of violence.
For the first time, the court was empowered to prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms by a defendant of an ADVO, and provision
was made for ex parte interim orders to be issued.
Expansion beyond domestic relationships
2.12 In 1989, the
Crimes (Apprehended Violence) Amendment Act 1989
(NSW) expanded the ADVO scheme again to
people, not just those in domestic relationships, who feared physical violence, harassment or molestation towards themselves. So,
for example, people could seek an order to protect themselves from threats against neighbours or colleagues. This reflected a concern
that the s 547 recognisance order was inadequate to protect those who feared violence outside of domestic relationships. It was considered
preferable to extend Part 15A rather than enact a new part of the
dealing with apprehended violence in non-domestic relationships.
The orders became known simply as AVOs to reflect that change.
2.13 This amendment generated controversy at the time among those who were concerned that it would remove the emphasis on the particular
problem of domestic violence, and that AVOs would be used in trivial or inappropriate ways.
Despite subsequent amendments to
, this controversy remains today.
2.14 The 1989 Act also clarified that harassment to or molestation of a person may occur even though there is no actual or threatened
violence to the person, and there is only actual or threatened damage to that person’s property. A new provision was also inserted
enabling an AVO to be sought on behalf of a child or a person with an intellectual disability where the protected person is unaware
of the threat to his or her safety.
1993 to 1996
2.15 Several amendments to Part 15A were made in 1993 and 1996. The
Crimes (Registration of Interstate Restraint Orders) Act 1993
(NSW) enabled protection orders made in other States and Territories to be enforced in NSW.
Also in 1993, the
Crimes (Domestic Violence) Amendment Act 1993
enabled police to apply for telephone interim orders after hours in certain circumstances;
enabled people over 16 to apply for their own AVO;
created a separate offence of intimidation relating to domestic violence;
introduced a new provision to prevent stalking; and
increased the penalties for breach of an AVO from a fine of $2000 to $5000, and from six months to two years imprisonment.
Crimes Amendment (Apprehended Violence Orders) Act 1996
(NSW) altered the AVO provisions by limiting the court’s discretion in the following respects. An authorised justice
issue either a summons or a warrant for the appearance of a defendant against whom an AVO is sought;
explain to the applicant and the defendant the rights of each party and the consequences of breaching an AVO;
issue an AVO where a person is convicted of a stalking, intimidation or domestic violence offence;
issue an interim AVO where a person is charged with a stalking, intimidation or domestic violence offence.
2.17 The 1996 amending Act also enabled a child under 16 to be included on an adult’s AVO, and enabled AVO proceedings involving
a child under 16 to be held in the absence of the general, or a specified member of, the public.
MOST RECENT CHANGES
Crimes Amendment (Apprehended Violence) Act 1999 (NSW)
2.18 The latest amendments to Part 15A were made in 1999 following a number of reviews of the legislation in the late 1990s.
Crimes Amendment (Apprehended Violence) Act 1999
(NSW) (“the 1999 amendments”) created two categories of AVOs within Part 15A: ADVOs
In his Second Reading Speech, the then Attorney General, the Hon J W Shaw, QC MLC, noted that the Government had been “most
conscious of concern regarding the conflation of domestic violence matters with non-domestic or ‘personal’ violence matters
under the AVO scheme” which had arguably “done a disservice to people experiencing domestic violence”.
Mr Shaw stated that separating AVOs into two categories not only recognised the “difference in the nature and level of violence
in domestic and non-domestic matters” but also established “significant legislative distinctions” in the ways in
which ADVOs and APVOs are treated.
2.19 The first such distinction is that authorised justices have a discretion to refuse to issue an APVO (except upon application
by a police officer) which they consider is based on a complaint that is “frivolous, without substance or has no reasonable
prospects of success”.
There is no such discretion in relation to an ADVO. Secondly, the court has a greater discretion to award costs against complainants
in APVO matters.
For ADVOs, the test for awarding costs against private applicants remains based on a “frivolous or vexatious” complaint,
whereas for APVOs, costs may be awarded where it seems “just and reasonable” to do so.
The third distinction between ADVOs and APVOs is that, in ADVO proceedings, there is a restriction on disclosure of the protected
person’s address or the complaint on which an order is based.
2.20 The final distinction between ADVOs and APVOs is the inclusion of an objects statement in Division 1A of Part 15A relating to
ADVOs. Those objects are essentially to prevent and protect against domestic violence.
The provision states that the objects are to be achieved by empowering the courts to make ADVOs and ensuring speedy, inexpensive,
safe and simple access to justice.
Recognition is also given to domestic violence being unacceptable, perpetrated mainly by men against women and children, and occurring
in all sectors of the community.
2.21 Whether the court issues an ADVO or an APVO depends on whether or not the applicant and the defendant are, or have been, in a
domestic relationship. Consequently, the definition of “domestic relationship” is highly significant. The 1999 amendments
extended that definition to include people living in the same household or residential facility, and people in a relationship of
ongoing, dependant care.
This amendment is intended to reflect the “domestic contexts in which people live”,
and, as a result, makes those people eligible to apply for ADVOs rather than APVOs. The definition of “de facto relationship”,
a sub-category of domestic relationship, was also changed to accord with the definition in the
Property Relationships Act 1984
(NSW) (“the PRA”).
2.22 The 1999 amendments also made a series of procedural and technical amendments which will be discussed later in this Paper.
OTHER LAWS AFFECTING AVOS
2.23 There are a number of other laws that impact on, and are affected by,
provides that the
Bail Act 1978
(NSW) applies to a defendant in AVO proceedings in the same way as it does to people charged with an offence.
Bail Act 1978
(NSW), there is a general presumption that bail be granted for particular non-violent offences.
However, that presumption does not apply in relation to domestic violence offences or breach of an ADVO
where the defendant has:
a history of violence;
been violent to the applicant in the past (whether or not the defendant was convicted of a violent offence); or
failed to comply with a bail condition that was applied by the court for the protection and welfare of the applicant.
2.25 An accused person is presumed to have a “history of violence” if he or she has been found guilty, within the last
10 years, of a domestic violence offence or of contravening an AVO by an act of violence.
Removing the presumption in favour of granting bail does not mean that bail will automatically be refused, but requires the defendant
to prove to the court why bail should be granted.
In deciding whether or not to grant bail, the court must take into account certain criteria, one of which is the protection of the
alleged victim.
2.26 When making an AVO (either an ADVO or an APVO) the court may make an order restricting or prohibiting the possession of all or
any specified firearms by the defendant.
If such an order is made, the court may, by the order, require the defendant to dispose of any firearms in his or her possession
and to surrender to the Commissioner of Police any licence permit or authority to possess the firearms in question.
Further, a licence or a permit to possess a firearm must not be issued to a person who is, or who has, at any time within 10 years
before the licence or permit application was made, been subject to an AVO.
A licence or a permit is also automatically suspended when an interim AVO is taken out against the licence or permit holder,
and automatically revoked if the interim AVO becomes final.
Firearms Act 1996
(NSW) also prohibits a person who is subject to an AVO from being a firearms dealer.
2.27 Where couples separate or divorce, orders may be made under the
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth) (“the FLA”) detailing the contact arrangements between any children of the relationship and the non-residential
parent. In situations where there is an AVO in addition to contact orders, the terms of the AVO and the contact order may conflict
with each other. For example, B may have taken out an AVO against A, specifying that A not approach the home of, or telephone, B.
Yet, under a contact order, A needs to pick up his or her children from B’s home, or telephone B regarding the children. The
conflict is heightened if the children are included in the AVO.
2.28 When making an order under the FLA, the Family Court must have the best interests of the child as its paramount concern.
Within that context, the court must ensure that any orders it makes are consistent with any family violence order and do not expose
any person to an unacceptable risk of family violence.
Division 11 of the FLA deals with the situation where there are contact orders and an AVO in place. The Family Court has the power
to make contact orders that are inconsistent with family violence orders, in which case the contact order will prevail to the extent
of the inconsistency with the family violence order.
However, a State court, when making or varying a family violence order, has the power to make, revive, vary, discharge,
or suspend a Division 11 contact order if the court considers that a person has been, or is likely to be, exposed to family violence
as a result of the operation of the contact order.
also has provisions regarding contact orders made under the FLA. An applicant for an AVO, or an applicant to vary an AVO, must inform
the court of any relevant contact order, or of proceedings pending in relation to contact orders.
The court must have regard to the existence of a contact order when deciding whether or not to grant an AVO.
The standard AVO orders
provide that the defendant must not approach, contact or telephone the protected person(s) except as agreed in writing or for any
purpose permitted under the FLA in relation to counselling, conciliation or mediation, or for the purpose of arranging or exercising
access to children.
2.30 Furthermore, the FLA and the PRA both contain provisions which allow for the making of injunctions for the personal protection
of a party to a marriage or de facto relationship.
The injunctions can be used instead of an AVO, and may relate to the occupancy or use of the home, restrain the other party from
entering or remaining in the home, or from entering a specified area surrounding the home, or entering the workplace of the applicant.
PREVIOUS REVIEWS
2.31 The subject of violence, and domestic violence in particular, has generated numerous studies into its causes, methods of prevention
and appropriate legal responses. More specifically, the AVO scheme in NSW has been the subject of several recent reviews and evaluations.
The most relevant reviews for the Commission’s purposes are discussed below.
Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research evaluation
2.32 The Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (“BOCSAR”) conducted an evaluation in 1997 of the AVO scheme in NSW to
determine whether or not AVOs were effective in providing protection from violence, abuse and harassment.
In his preface to the report, BOCSAR’s Director, Dr Don Weatherburn, noted that much of the commentary on AVOs until that point,
had centred around issues of process, such as the ease of obtaining an AVO and their potential for abuse in family law proceedings.
Dr Weatherburn considered this to be “unfortunate”, since “questions about the administration of the [AVO] scheme
are secondary to the question of whether the scheme itself is effective”.
2.33 The BOCSAR Report surveyed a sample of people (men and women) who had been granted AVOs concerning their experiences after the
AVO was issued and their general level of satisfaction with the AVO process. Over 90% of survey respondents perceived that the AVO
had resulted in benefits such as increased peace of mind and a greater feeling of safety.
This Report is discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.
Survey of Magistrates
2.34 In 1999, the Judicial Commission of NSW released a
Survey of Magistrates
The Survey detailed the responses of Magistrates to a questionnaire asking about their attitude to their roles, and to the issues
involved, in AVOs. All respondents to this survey considered that ADVOs were effective in addressing domestic violence. This is compared
with 71% of Magistrates who considered APVOs to be an ineffective way of dealing with personal violence or harassment. One of the
major reasons given for the difference in perceived levels of effectiveness between ADVOs and APVOs was the belief that APVOs were
increasingly being used unmeritoriously in response to “trivial” matters. Following from this, 52% of Magistrates surveyed
considered that APVOs would be better dealt with in a forum other than Local Courts, such as Community Justice Centres or counselling
services, compared with 68% who believed the Local Court was the most appropriate forum for dealing with ADVOs.
2.35 Other themes emerging from the Survey included the need for an expanded role for Chamber Magistrates, better court resources,
and a better system for screening out frivolous cases, such as the introduction of a filing fee.
Model Domestic Violence Laws
2.36 In September 1996, the Federal Government convened the National Domestic Violence Forum to address appropriate and effective
responses to domestic violence. Arising out of that forum, suggestions for reforming the laws dealing with the prevention and punishment
of domestic violence were made, including the need for greater national consistency. The Domestic Violence Legislation Working Group,
comprising representatives from the Commonwealth and each State and Territory, was formed to review the existing domestic violence
laws and propose a uniform or model law. The Working Group released a Discussion Paper in November 1997, and a Report, entitled
Model Domestic Violence Laws,
in April 1999.
The Report recommended model legislation for all States and Territories with a view to achieving a comprehensive and co-operative
national approach to domestic violence legislation.
Criminal Law Review Division Review
2.37 In 1999, the Attorney General requested the Criminal Law Review Division (“CLRD”) of the Attorney General’s
Department to conduct a review of
The brief given to CLRD was quite specific, requiring a review of:
(1) The delineation between ADVOs and APVOs.
(2) An alternative regime for dealing with personal violence matters.
(3) The definition of “domestic relationship” for the purpose of determining the scope of the Apprehended Violence provisions.
(4) Whether an authorised justice should have a discretion to refuse to issue process and if so, for what categories of complaint
and in what circumstances.
(5) Whether the costs provisions contained in
are appropriate.
(6) The status of a complaint for an Apprehended Violence Order when an order is made by consent and without admission.
(7) Whether Part 15A should include a preamble stating the objectives of the legislation to guide and inform interpretation.
(8) The further development of technical and other features of the legislation to enhance protection and facilitate the legal process
in AVO applications.
(9) Any related matter/s.
2.38 The CLRD review examined procedural issues, in addition to broader questions such as whether or not AVOs were being abused or
inappropriately sought, whether AVOs sought in relation to domestic violence offences should receive different legislative treatment
from other AVO applications, and if so, how should that difference be reflected.
2.39 Around 50 submissions from interested groups and individuals were received in response to CLRD’s Discussion Paper. Overall,
most respondents supported the AVO provisions, considering them to be appropriate and functional. However, a few issues were mentioned
in a number of submissions which were viewed as being contrary to the objectives of the legislation.
2.40 A recurrent theme in submissions was the inappropriate use of AVOs. While there was overwhelming recognition of the need for
some readily available mechanism to protect people in genuine fear of danger, concern was expressed that the ease of obtaining an
AVO resulted in trivial and vexatious applications. The major area in which abuse of AVO procedures was identified was in family
law disputes. This issue is discussed later this Paper.
2.41 Other issues raised included the desirability of distinguishing between AVOs for domestic violence and those for personal violence
due to the need to provide special protection for domestic violence victims. Concern was also expressed that “domestic relationship”
should be defined more broadly and flexibly to encompass carers, guardians and “cultural” relatives, so as to make the
concept more applicable to Aboriginal people.

a marriage. See para 2.30.

A Magistrate could require the defendant to post a monetary bond, which could be forfeited if the recognisance were breached. It

include the need to protect the child from physical of psychological harm, the incidence of family violence and the existence of
a family violence order: FLA s 68F(2)(g), s 68F(2)(i) and s 68F(2)(j).
FLA s 68K(1). Parties to proceedings who are aware of the existence of a family violence order must inform the court about the order:
FLA s 68J(1). Non-parties may make such a disclosure to the court, subject to the appropriate Rules of Court: FLA s 68J(2).
A State court cannot discharge a Division 11 contact order when making an interim family violence order, or an order varying a family
violence order: FLA s 68T(2)(d).
s 562FA(2).

3. Policy objectives
History of this reference (Digest)
Objectives of AVOs
Should the objects be extended?
3.1 The first part of the Commission’s brief is to assess whether the policy objectives of the AVO provisions, contained in
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW), remain valid. This chapter attempts to identify the objectives of AVOs and the legislation that underpins them. It considers
the impact of the legislative provisions on people who may be more vulnerable than others, either because circumstance makes them
potentially more susceptible to violence or abuse, or because they are less likely to be in a position to benefit from obtaining
OBJECTIVES OF AVOS
3.2 The primary objective of all protection order schemes is to prevent and protect against violence. This is also the objective of
much of the criminal law. However, as can be seen from the discussion in the previous chapter concerning the development of AVO legislation,
the criminal law is not always the most effective or appropriate way of preventing violence, intimidation or harassment
it occurs. AVOs are designed to be a flexible and accessible supplement to the criminal law. In some cases, they may act as a specific
warning not to commit a criminal offence. In other instances, an AVO may also place restrictions on the behaviour or activities of
the defendant to limit the likelihood of a violent offence being committed.
3.3 When introducing the AVO legislation into Parliament, the then Premier, the Hon Neville Wran, QC MP, stated the intention of the
AVO provisions:
I believe that this law reform will provide effective and immediate relief for those women who spend their lives worrying when the
next battering will be.
3.4 Originally designed to protect against physical violence in domestic relationships,
currently provides for Apprehended Domestic Violence Orders (“ADVOs”) and Apprehended Personal Violence Orders (“APVOs”)
to be granted where the applicant fears that he or she will be the victim of some form of physical, psychological or emotional abuse.
The gradual expansion of
to cover relationships beyond domestic ones created concerns that the focus of the AVO provisions would shift from domestic violence,
and could result in domestic violence being viewed as less significant. In an attempt to allay these concerns, a section setting
out the objects of the ADVO provisions was included in
in 1999. There is no equivalent statement of objectives in relation to APVOs
or the provisions containing the offences of stalking and intimidation.
3.5 The stated objects of the ADVO provisions are:
to ensure the safety and protection of all persons who experience domestic violence; and
to reduce and prevent violence between persons who are in a domestic relationship with each other; and
to enact provisions that are consistent with certain principles underlying the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against
3.6 These objects are to be achieved by empowering the courts to make ADVOs to protect people from domestic violence and ensuring
that access to the courts is as speedy, inexpensive, safe and simple as is consistent with justice.
Section 562AC also states that, in enacting the ADVO provisions, Parliament recognises that domestic violence is unacceptable, perpetrated
mainly by men against women and children, and occurs in all sectors of the community.
3.7 These objects reflect calls over a number of years for guiding principles to be included in legislation dealing with domestic
violence. For example, Rosemary Hunter and Julie Stubbs were critical of the Domestic Violence Legislation Working Group for failing
to include a preamble or set of principles in the Model Domestic Violence Laws Report,
claiming that many debates and controversies concerning domestic violence laws could be resolved by the inclusion of appropriate
principles in the legislation. They suggested that the overriding principle should be to protect those who experience domestic violence,
and that legislation should also note the prevalence of domestic violence in all sections of the Australian community, the fact that
the majority of domestic violence is perpetrated by men against women and children
and the need for perpetrators to take responsibility for their actions and for stopping the violence.
3.8 A similar objects statement exists in the
Domestic Violence Act 1995
(NZ) (“the NZ Act”). The object of the NZ Act is to reduce and prevent violence in domestic relationships by recognising
that violence, in all its forms, is unacceptable behaviour, and ensuring that there is effective legal protection for victims of
domestic violence.
Like Division 1A of Part 15A, the NZ Act aims to achieve its objectives by empowering the court to make orders to protect victims
of domestic violence and ensuring that access to the court is as speedy, inexpensive and simple as is consistent with justice. However,
the NZ Act has a more comprehensive, rehabilitative focus than Part 15A,
and contains the following additional objectives:
Providing, for persons who are victims of domestic violence, appropriate programs;
Requiring respondents to attend programs that have the primary objective of stopping or preventing domestic violence; and
Providing more effective sanctions and enforcement in the event that a protection order is breached.
SHOULD THE OBJECTS BE EXTENDED?
3.9 It is possible to infer from Part 15A certain unstated objectives which extend beyond those that are prescribed. As noted previously,
only the ADVO provisions of Part 15A contain stated objects. This has the advantage of highlighting the special nature of domestic
violence, and the particular need to empower women who are most likely to be the subjects of such violence, and the desire of the
legislature to provide adequate means of addressing its prevention. However, it could be seen as clouding the focus of Part 15A as
a whole to have a set of objectives for one Division but not for the others.
3.10 It is possible to expand the objects of Part 15A to apply generally to ADVOs and APVOs, while still recognising the significance
of measures designed to prevent domestic violence.
An example can be found in the
Protection Orders Act 2001
(ACT). Like Part 15A, the ACT legislation covers violence in domestic and other relationships. Its objects are:
To prevent violence between family members and others who are in a domestic relationship, recognising that domestic violence is a
particular form of interpersonal violence that needs a greater level of protective response; and
To provide a mechanism to facilitate the safety and protection of people who experience domestic or personal violence.
3.11 An expanded statement of objects for Part 15A could read as follows:
To supplement the criminal law by attempting to prevent violence, harassment, stalking and intimidation being perpetrated by one person
against another;
To provide an effective, fast, responsive, accessible and enforceable legal mechanism to deter violence in all its forms before it
To recognise the particularly insidious nature of violence within domestic relationships and the need for an appropriate and effective
legislative response;
To recognise that women and children are most likely to be the subjects of domestic violence; and
To limit the opportunities for the legislation to be used inappropriately, particularly outside the domestic context.
The Commission seeks views on whether the objects of Part 15A should be stated in this manner.
Are the current objects applicable to ADVOs appropriate?
Is the fact that the objects apply only to ADVOs beneficial, or does it detract from the overall effect of Part 15A?
Should the objects be made more general, yet still emphasise the special nature of domestic violence?

4. Assessing the objectives
History of this reference (Digest)
Difficulties In determining validity
Effectiveness of protection orders
Factors influencing effectiveness
4.1 In this chapter, the Commission examines ways of assessing the validity of the policy objectives discussed in the previous chapter,
and notes the drawbacks associated with any attempt to make such an assessment. It also looks generally at the effectiveness of AVOs,
and Part 15A in particular, as a means of stopping or preventing violence or abuse.
DIFFICULTIES IN DETERMINING VALIDITY
4.2 If the central object of the AVO provisions is to prevent violence and abuse, then the validity of the objectives is determined
by their effectiveness in achieving that goal. As noted in Chapter 1, the effectiveness of AVOs can be difficult to measure.
4.3 Available statistics do not provide a comprehensive picture of the use or effectiveness of AVOs, and are open to a number of interpretations.
For example, the increase in the number of final AVOs granted in the past year
may be interpreted by some to mean that the threshold for obtaining an order is too low. Alternatively, that statistic could be seen
as an indication that Part 15A is fulfilling its objective of accessibility, and that better awareness of legislation, better training
of police, solicitors, court staff, chamber magistrates, domestic violence counsellors and support services, etc, has led to greater
use of the Act.
Similarly, recent statistics show that the total rate of assault increased by 7.6% from January 2000 to December 2001.
This could mean either that Part 15A has failed in its objective of preventing violence, or that more domestic and personal violence
is being reported and prosecuted as a result of measures such as AVOs.
4.4 A final, controversial example concerns the fact that over 40% of interim AVOs are withdrawn or dismissed prior to the final hearing.
Some commentators have claimed that this indicates that the applications were not soundly enough based to begin with.
Others argue that the rate of withdrawal could reflect a number of factors, such as pressure on the applicant from the defendant,
family, friends or the community, fear of reprisal, or uncertainty concerning legal processes, or technical problems such as failing
to serve the summons on the defendant.
These arguments highlight deficiencies in the law and its implementation for failing to keep applicants in the system. However, the
withdrawal rate could also indicate that the act of initiating process in itself was sufficient, in some cases, to stop or prevent
violence, indicating that Part 15A had succeeded in its objectives. Consequently, any inferences drawn from statistics must be approached
cautiously.
4.5 Another way to gauge the effectiveness of AVOs is to look at the perceptions of people who have used AVOs under Part 15A and other
equivalent legislation.
EFFECTIVENESS OF PROTECTION ORDERS
General views
4.6 Protection orders are said to have the advantage of being quicker, cheaper, more accessible and have better enforcement mechanisms
than injunctions under the FLA or PRA.
They are seen as a “necessary complement” to, but not a replacement of, the criminal law,
and have the potential to act as a useful “circuit breaker” without evoking the full force of the criminal law.
In recommending a system of protection orders for the ACT, the Australian Law Reform Commission (“the ALRC”) noted the
educational importance of such orders:
[T]he importance of instituting a protection order regime goes beyond whatever effectiveness it may have in preventing or deterring
future domestic violence offences. Undoubtedly, it will not be completely effective: it will not stop some offenders. But the symbolic
and educative role of the law should not be overlooked. Provision for protection orders is a substantial measure which would reflect
the law and society’s disapproval of violence in the home. Given the importance of public perceptions in this matter, a clear
statement of the law’s position is obviously desirable.
4.7 Another significant advantage of protection orders is that they shift what in the past has been considered “private”
violence between intimate partners, etc, into the public sphere.
The restraining order is a critical tool for lawmakers attempting to deal with private violence. When properly crafted, the restraining
order will protect individuals from immediate harm, prevent the recurrence of violence, and send a message to the community which
will discourage others from perpetrating acts of domestic violence.
4.8 Those expressing an alternative view consider that protection orders only deter people who are normally “law abiding”
from future acts of violence, and have little effect on persistent offenders.
It has also been suggested that breaches of protection orders are not policed as vigilantly as they should be,
that they operate unfairly on defendants,
and weigh heavily on police and court time.
Effectiveness studies
4.9 A number of studies have been conducted in Australia and overseas in which applicants for protection orders were surveyed concerning
their experiences with the procedural aspects of obtaining the orders and their effect in stopping or reducing violence. The surveys
revealed positive and negative results.
The outcome of these studies needs to be seen in the light of the inherent limitations in assessing the effectiveness of AVOs noted
by the Commission in Chapter 1.
4.10 Studies of relevant legislation in Western Australia and the United States reported that the majority of applicants were largely
satisfied with the outcome and were of the view that obtaining a protection order had been beneficial.
In a 1992 Western Australian study, 83% of applicants who received final restraining orders were satisfied with the outcome,
70% saying they would re-apply for an order in the future if further violence occurred,
and 67% would advise others to seek a restraining order if the need arose.
Curiously, this view was held despite the fact that most applicants said that the order had either no effect, or resulted in reduced
levels of physical violence accompanied by a concurrent increase in verbal abuse or harassment.
A study in southern California revealed that physical violence continued for 1 in 8 applicants following the protection order, with
none reporting increased levels of violence.
A Connecticut study found that the orders increased police responsiveness to domestic violence and empowered the applicants to end
abusive relationships, with the likelihood of future violence dependant on other factors such as prior criminal history or substance
4.11 This is consistent with findings of the Australian Institute of Criminology (“AIC”) on the effectiveness of legal
intervention in domestic violence.
When comparing outcomes for women who had sought protection orders as opposed to women who had experienced violence but not sought
orders, the AIC found that physical violence had ceased for most women in the 12 months prior to the interview, regardless of whether
they had sought police or court intervention.
However, for those who had sought both police protection and court orders, the level of violence was significantly reduced compared
with women who had sought only one remedy.
4.12 Two studies conducted by the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (“BOCSAR”), specifically relating to Part 15A,
have yielded mixed results. The first, conducted in 1989, reported that almost half of the survey respondents felt that the AVO had
met their expectations of stopping the violence or keeping the defendant away, while a further 20% indicated that the AVO had been
at least partially effective. However, almost one-third of respondents considered that the AVO failed to achieve its objectives.
Despite this, almost 90% of respondents indicated that they would apply for an AVO again if the need arose in the future,
and 39% would encourage others to apply for an AVO.
4.13 The second evaluation in 1997 was more positive overall.
BOCSAR surveyed a sample of people (men and women) who had been granted AVOs,
concerning their experiences after the AVO was issued and their general level of satisfaction with the AVO process. The findings
revealed that, prior to the AVO, 75.2% of subjects had experienced a continuing pattern of violence, abuse or harassment, some for
more than ten years.
Following the AVO, the vast majority of those surveyed reported that the AVO had brought about a reduction in, or cessation of, the
violent, abusive or intimidating behaviour.
Over 90% of survey respondents perceived that the AVO had resulted in benefits such as increased peace of mind and a greater feeling
approximately 75% reported that the AVO had created no problems,
and 88.1% replied that they would apply for another AVO in the future if the need arose.
4.14 The BOCSAR Report concludes that while these effects may have occurred anyway without the AVO, the fact that there had been a
continuing pattern of violence before the AVO was taken out made this unlikely.
The reasons given for this apparent effectiveness were:
the ramifications of breaching an AVO acted as a deterrent;
the act of taking out an AVO showed the defendant that the applicant was serious;
the decision to apply for an AVO and pursue the process acted as a catalyst for changes to the lives of the applicants, which lessened
the risk of being subjected to violence, abuse or harassment. For example, the AVO may have resulted in the applicant terminating
communications with the defendant, or implementing alternative methods for handing children over to the defendant for contact visits.
FACTORS INFLUENCING EFFECTIVENESS
4.15 It is clear from the above studies that many factors contribute to the effectiveness of AVOs. Some concern the scope and procedural
elements of the legislation. Other factors impinging on the effectiveness of AVOs operate beyond the scope of the legislation. For
example, it is one thing to have adequate legislative provisions enabling easy access to AVOs and providing sanctions in the event
that an AVO is breached, but quite another for those provisions to be properly enforced:
[I]n order to be effective, restraining order legislation must ensure that orders are readily accessible, tailored to the particular
needs of the victim, and consistently enforced to deter batterers from continued violent behaviour.
4.16 As pointed out in the BOCSAR 1997 Report, AVOs can also have repercussions in terms of behavioural changes in the applicant
and defendant which can contribute to the effectiveness of AVOs. These have been described as “collateral” effects of
AVOs, which can “create an environment in which the offender will perceive that it is in his interest not to continue abuse”.
The collateral effects are those such as increased police responsiveness to domestic violence, and empowering applicants to become
more independent which results in them being at less “risk” of violence.
It has been argued that, in effect, the process of obtaining an AVO is “partially its own reward”.
4.17 While the Commission’s main focus is on legislative reform, we are interested in how the implementation and “collateral”
effects of Part 15A can be optimised by improvements to legislative policy and procedure.
Are AVOs an efficient and effective way of preventing violence, intimidation, stalking and harassment? Why or why not?
What general factors promote or hamper the effectiveness of AVOs?
Are these factors largely issues of implementation, or can they be addressed by amending Part 15A?

5. Abuse of AVOs
History of this reference (Digest)
ADVOs in the context of family law proceedings
"Frivolous" use of APVOs
5.1 Allegations are consistently made that AVOs are being sought and used inappropriately. This chapter explores the two major areas
particularly affected by those allegations. First, it is suggested that ADVOs are being sought too readily, and often vindictively,
in family law proceedings. Secondly, it is alleged that the recent proliferation of APVOs points to a preponderance of trivial applications.
ADVOS IN THE CONTEXT OF FAMILY LAW PROCEEDINGS
5.2 Although domestic violence is commonly dealt with in the
by way of AVOs, it is a very relevant issue in the context of family law proceedings. Domestic violence is often about control within
relationships and this control factor is at its worst at the end of a relationship. In 1996, the Australian Bureau of Statistics
found that 23% of women who had ever been married or in a de facto relationship, experienced violence at some time during the relationship.
The Family Court’s approach to family violence
5.3 In the early years of the
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth) (“the FLA”), in keeping with the Act’s focus on “no fault” divorce, the Family Court minimised
the relevance of domestic violence as a factor affecting the welfare of the children. Thus, some of the very early cases distinguished
between the father’s affection for his children and his violent behaviour as a husband.
5.4 This approach had changed significantly by the mid-1990s. In 1994, in the case of
Chisholm J reviewed the legal principles relevant to allegations of family violence and stressed the importance of recognising its
relevance in proceedings relating to custody, guardianship and access. The
Family Law Reform Act 1995
(Cth) (“the FLRA”) constructed a framework for dealing with issues of family violence. Section 68F(2) of the FLA now
recognises the “need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm caused, or that may be caused” by factors
including “family violence”.
5.5 However, the FLRA also introduced other principles aimed at shared parenting. This has resulted in the emergence of a very distinct
“pro-contact” culture whereby the right of the child to have regular contact with both parents, except in the most serious
cases, is now enshrined within the legislation. The relevant provision is section 60B(2) of the FLA which provides that:
(a) children have the right to know and be cared for by both of their parents;
(b) children have a right of contact, on a regular basis, with both of their parents;
(c) parents share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children; and
(d) such rights, duties and responsibilities are to exist except where it would be contrary to a child’s best interests.
5.6 While family violence is clearly unacceptable, there are now two almost contradictory responses to it within the family law context.
On the one hand, the FLA recognises the serious nature of family violence by specifying it as a relevant factor in considering the
“best interests of the child”,
and requiring that it be reported in all matters before the court.
Yet, simultaneously, a presumption in favour of contact appears to have developed.
5.7 The provisions introduced by the FLRA have been under scrutiny in two research reports to ascertain if the best interests of children
are being served. The first of these studies found that it is now more difficult to obtain orders for “no contact” at
interim hearings, even when there are allegations of violence against the contact parent, and that the court is more likely than
previously to try to preserve contact between the child and the non-resident parent, especially at interim hearings.
5.8 A further research study on the operation of the FLRA between 1996 and 1999 found that the previously held view which recognised
the impact of domestic violence upon children’s welfare appears to have been superseded by concerns about maintaining contact
between a parent and child.
5.9 The Chief Justice of the Family Court has also recently noted that there is:
tension between the increased emphasis on the protection of children from family violence in the Act and the right of contact principle….This
tension, the research tells us, has translated into a greater tendency for non resident parents to expect contact, even when domestic
violence is an issue, and for there to be pressure on resident parents to agree to contact, despite safety concerns.
The interaction between ADVOs and contact orders
5.10 Although there is a procedure for obtaining a restraining order or an injunction aimed at stopping domestic violence under the
it would appear that the ADVO provisions in the
are more commonly used by people seeking protection. In many cases, people who have a matter in the Family Court, have either taken
an ADVO against their partner or are subject to an ADVO, or are in the process of obtaining one.
5.11 Given that contact between children and non-resident parents is given great emphasis, it is important that contact orders need
to focus on the safety of the children and the accompanying parent at the time of hand over as well as generally.
5.12 Clearly, both the Local Court and the Family Court jurisdictions need to take cognisance of the presence of ADVOs or contact
orders, as the case may be. Both the FLA and
deal with the relationship between AVOs and contact orders. Section 562FA of the
provides that a person applying for an ADVO or a variation of an ADVO must inform the court of a contact order or a pending contact
order. Similarly, section 68K of the FLA requires that parties involved in Family Court matters are obliged to inform the court of
any AVO which applies to the child or a member of the child’s family. The Family Court has the discretion to make a contact
order which is inconsistent with an AVO, but must explain the rationale of the order.
In AVO proceedings, the Local Court also the power to make, revive, vary, discharge,
or suspend a Division 11 contact order if the court considers that a person has been, or is likely to be, exposed to family violence
as a result of the operation of the contact order.
Abuse of ADVOs
5.13 The Commission has received submissions from some groups alleging that the ADVO provisions are being abused to gain a tactical
advantage in family law proceedings.
The CLRD review received similar submissions. This view was also put forward in a parliamentary debate:
There is some reluctance by defendants of an interim apprehended violence order to consent to an interim AVO because of the impact
that that may have on custody or other proceedings. Whilst we might not like it, AVO proceedings are being used as tools in custody
battles and in matrimonial arrangements.
5.14 The Survey of Magistrates also found that 90% of respondents were of the view that ADVOs were used by applicants in Family
Court proceedings as a tactic to aid their case and deprive their partner of access to children.
5.15 Despite these claims, various reviews that have considered this issue have not found this assertion to be substantiated. The
CLRD Review noted that “the allegation that women use AVOs to gain some tactical advantage in family law proceedings is not
reflected in research on Family Court outcomes”. The CLRD Discussion Paper further stated that:
the reality is that a claim of domestic violence does not necessarily impact on family law proceedings. There is no empirical evidence
to suggest that women are under the impression that it does and deliberately manufacture false claims of domestic violence for this
5.16 The CRLD Review argued that the fact that an ADVO complaint is made at the same time as an application for a family court order
makes sense, given the number of ADVO complainants with dependent children, and the fact that violence often escalates at the time
of the separation, at which time future parenting arrangements also become an issue.
5.17 This issue was also discussed in the research conducted by Rhodes, Graycar and Harrison on the first three years of the FLRA.
They acknowledged suggestions that allegations of violence are sometimes used for strategic purposes in litigation. However, they
referred to various research studies that have “shown conclusively that only a small proportion of such allegations fail to
be established”.
5.18 The study also negated the assertion that women were reluctant to facilitate a relationship between their child and his or her
non-resident parent, citing a judge’s view that:
women [with domestic violence concerns] usually want contact, either because they genuinely want the children to see him, or because
they know he wont get off their back otherwise. So you’re struggling to find a way to allow contact where the woman is not
going to be exposed to vicarious violence.
5.19 An English study
supports this view, where contrary to popular stereotypes, the majority of the women in this study initially supported continued
in such a way that there was no further violence or harassment.
5.20 The Commission is interested to receive more information about the interplay between ADVOs and family law contact orders, and
suggestions for any amendments to
in this regard.
What concerns are there about the use of ADVOs in family law matters?
Does the legislation sufficiently address those concerns? What improvements can be made?
“FRIVOLOUS” USE OF APVOS
5.21 For some time, concern has been expressed over the growth in the number of APVO applications and the impact this has on the effectiveness
of AVOs overall.
It has been alleged that APVOs are being sought regarding “trivial” issues, such as disputes over building being conducted
in a neighbour’s backyard,
or even for vindictive purposes such as blackmail.
It has been suggested that the increasing popularity of APVOs as a way of dealing with friction between neighbours and colleagues
has done a disservice to people who genuinely fear personal violence or abuse, and taken AVOs too far away from their original purpose
of protecting against domestic violence. This view is supported by the majority of Magistrates surveyed in relation to AVO issues
in 1999, where 71% of Magistrates surveyed considered APVOs to be an
ineffective
way of dealing with personal violence or harassment.
One of the major reasons given for this perception was the belief that APVOs were increasingly being used unmeritoriously in response
to “trivial” matters.
5.22 The CLRD Discussion Paper argued that there is “little empirical evidence either supporting or refuting the claim that
APVOs are routinely being abused”.
However, that Discussion Paper also noted that even if APVOs were not being sought vexatiously, it could be argued that the Local
Court is not the right forum for dealing with such disputes, given the court’s focus on adversarial litigation and the fact
that the parties need to continue to live or work in close proximity.
This argument is supported by the Magistrates Survey, in which 52% of considered that APVOs would be better dealt with in other forums,
such as Community Justice Centres or counselling services.
5.23 The CLRD Discussion Paper noted that “careful consideration” should be given to providing alternative methods of
resolving problems that form the basis of APVO complaints. To this end, the Paper put forward options for distinguishing between
ADVOs and APVOs, some of which were implemented by the
Crimes Amendment (Apprehended Violence) Act 1999
(NSW). For example, there is a discretion to refuse to issue process in APVO applications which does not exist in relation to ADVOs.
There is also more scope to award costs against the applicant in APVO matters. Both of these measures are discussed below.
The discretion to refuse to issue process in APVO matters
5.24 Where an APVO complaint is made by an applicant in person, the court has a discretion to refuse to issue process. That discretion
does not apply where the complaint is made by a police officer.
Section 562AK of the
provides that a court may refuse to issue process if it is satisfied that the complaint is “frivolous, vexatious, without substance
or has no reasonable prospect of success”.
5.25 The intention of
is that “genuine applicants for APVOs continue to have access to the courts for protection”.
Accordingly, there is a presumption in favour of issuing process where the complaint discloses allegations of:
(a) a personal violence offence; or
(b) stalking or intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical or mental harm; or
(c) harassment relating to the complainant’s race, religion, homosexuality, transgender status, HIV/AIDS or other disability.
5.26 In determining whether to make an APVO, the court must take the following matters into account:
(a) the nature of the allegations,
(b) whether the matter is amenable to mediation or other alternative dispute resolution,
(c) whether the parties have previously attempted to resolve the matter by mediation or other means,
(d) the availability and accessibility of mediation or other alternative dispute resolution services,
(e) the willingness and capacity of each party to resolve the matter otherwise than through a complaint for an apprehended personal
violence order,
(f) the relative bargaining powers of the parties,
(g) whether the complaint is in the nature of a cross application,
(h) any other matters that the authorised justice considers relevant.
5.27 This provision attempts to facilitate the granting of APVOs in genuine circumstances while filtering out unmeritorious complaints.
However, the wording of the provision may be self-defeating. There is a presumption against exercising the discretion to refuse to
issue process where the complaint discloses allegations of a personal violence or stalking or intimidation offence, or harassment
in certain circumstances. Yet, these are the very grounds on which most AVOs are based.
5.28 The Commission is interested to hear whether courts are in fact exercising the discretion to refuse to issue process in APVO
matters, and, if so, in what circumstances. We would also like opinions on whether or not APVOs are being inappropriately sought,
and, if so, the extent of the problem.
How effective has the discretion to refuse to issue process in APVO matters been? Has it resulted in fewer “frivolous”
applications?
5.29 Another measure introduced in 1999 to discourage frivolous or abusive APVO claims is the lower threshold for awarding costs against
an APVO applicant. Prior to 1999, costs could be awarded against in applicant in all AVO proceedings only where the court was satisfied
that the complaint was “frivolous or vexatious”. That provision was inserted in 1987 at a time when
applied only to ADVOs,
and reflected the policy that victims of domestic violence should not be deterred from seeking protection because of fear of having
to pay the defendant’s costs.
5.30 The CLRD Discussion Paper suggested that consideration should be given to whether the same “public policy reasons”
for the awarding of costs extended to APVOs as well as ADVOs.
Accordingly, in 1999,
was amended to provide for costs to be awarded against an applicant in APVO matters where the court considers it to be “just
and reasonable”.
Where a police officer applies on behalf of an applicant for an ADVO or an APVO, costs will only be awarded where the officer knew
that the complaint “contained matter that was false or misleading in a material particular”.
5.31 The Commission would like to hear particulars about costs being awarded in APVO matters, and views on whether the costs provision
discourages frivolous or abusive APVO complaints.
Does the costs provision act as a deterrent against unmeritorious claims? Please give examples.
Should the costs provision be strengthened?
Other measures
5.32 Another measure to discourage the number of trivial APVOs discussed in the CLRD Paper included the introduction of a filing fee.
It was noted, however, that a filing fee may discourage genuine applicants with limited financial resources.
5.33 Another option was to refer APVO matters to mediation rather than deal with them in the Local Courts.
currently provides that, when considering whether or not to grant an APVO, the court must consider if the matter is suitable for
mediation. The legislation does not, however, require APVO matters to be referred to mediation before coming to court. Mediation
through organisations such as Community Justice Centres (“CJCs”) may be appropriate for some types of disputes, particularly
those between neighbours, where the disputants have an on-going relationship. An option may be for AVO legislation to require mediation
to have been attempted before an APVO can be granted. This could be done either through the parties demonstrating that they have
attempted to have the matter mediated before seeking an APVO, or to provide for the court to refer parties to an APVO application
to mediation. Should the matter fail to be mediated, and the threat of violence, intimidation or harassment still persist, then an
APVO may be granted as a last resort.
5.34 This approach may help to deter trivial APVO applications. However, there would be drawbacks. Not all APVO-type matters, particularly
those involving serious violence or stalking, may be amenable to mediation. It would also place the court in the unenviable situation
of having to determine whether the threat of violence was insufficiently imminent to defer an APVO pending mediation. Furthermore,
there are serious doubts as to the effectiveness of compulsory mediation where the parties do not consent. The proposal would also
have significant resource implications as additional mediation would need to be funded. The Commission is interested to hear views
on the role that mediation should play in APVO matters.
Should a filing fee be introduced for APVO matters? If so, in what circumstances?
What role should mediation have in the resolution of APVO disputes?
What other measures could be introduced to discourage unmeritorious or abusive APVO applications?
Should AVO legislation continue to provide for APVOs at all? If so, how?

frivolous, vexatious or has not been made honestly:

Discussion Paper 45 (2002) - Apprehended Violence Orders: Part 15A of the Crimes Act
6. Structure of Part 15A
History of this reference (Digest)
Separate AVO legislation?
Separate domestic violence legislation?
6.1 This chapter examines some of the issues that emerge concerning the structure of Part 15A and its location in the
. As noted in Chapter 1,
is a civil procedure obtained on the balance of probabilities, despite being located in the
. Being placed in the
has the benefit of reinforcing the fact that violence, abuse and harassment is a crime and should be taken seriously. However, it
also has the disadvantage of giving the AVO procedure what has been referred to as the “taint of criminality”.
It could be argued that this detracts from the effectiveness of AVOs as many applicants may want to stop or prevent the violence
they fear or are experiencing, without necessarily wanting to invoke criminal consequences for the defendant.
This is particularly pertinent in cases of domestic violence where there is often a financial and emotional interdependence between
the applicant and the defendant.
6.2 Another issue concerns the fact that the current
covers both domestic and personal violence. The
Crimes Amendment (Apprehended Violence) Act 1999
(NSW) affected a separation between ADVOs and APVOs to address the concern that had existed in the decade during which Part 15A made
no distinction between the two type of orders.
There was a feeling that the “conflation” of ADVOs and APVOs had done a disservice to victims of domestic violence and
diminished the effectiveness of ADVOs.
As the division between the two types of orders was only affected in 1999, there has been no analysis of the practical consequences
that have ensued. The Commission is interested to learn what effect the distinction between ADVOs and APVOs has brought about, and
whether the objective of improving the effectiveness of ADVOs has been achieved.
6.3 It may be that current legislation strikes the right balance between civil and criminal procedure, and domestic and personal violence.
Alternatively, some may think that the effectiveness of AVOs could be better achieved by removing the provisions from the
into separate legislation covering both ADVOs and APVOs. Another possibility is to follow the lead of other jurisdictions which have
effected a more definite split between domestic and personal violence by having a separate Domestic Violence Act. Both of these options
are discussed below.
SEPARATE AVO LEGISLATION?
6.4 Other jurisdictions have specific legislation which deals comprehensively with protection orders. For example, Western Australia
Restraining Orders Act 1997
(WA), which provides for violence restraining orders to protect against acts of personal violence,
and misconduct restraining orders to prevent intimidating or offensive behaviour, property damage and disorderly conduct.
Violence restraining orders may be in force for longer than misconduct restraining orders, and harsher penalties apply. The distinction
is based on the defendant’s behaviour, and not on the relationship between the applicant and the defendant.
6.5 Under the
Protection Orders Act 2001
(ACT), applicants may obtain a domestic violence order or a personal protection order.
The legislation defines domestic violence and personal violence,
sets out the objects of, and procedures for, obtaining protection orders, and provides examples and explanations throughout the legislation.
It also contains cross references to other relevant legislation such as the
Crimes Act 1900
Domestic Violence Agencies Act 1986
6.6 Adopting a similar approach in NSW could be beneficial in that it would provide a central legislative basis for AVOs. This could
be seen as a recognition of the importance of AVOs as a means of combating violence, abuse and harassment. The legislation could
refer to the domestic and personal violence offences contained in the
, yet having separate legislation would help to clarify that AVOs are not criminal in themselves. Such legislation would also have
the potential to be more “user friendly” than the
, and could offer a more integrated approach by referring to violence support and prevention initiatives, references which may not
be appropriate in the
6.7 The major drawback of separate AVO legislation would be the perception that AVOs had been “sidelined” from the more
. This may give the impression that violent actions which prompt the issuing of an AVO are somehow taken less seriously.
SEPARATE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LEGISLATION?
6.8 Much has been written on the unique nature of domestic violence as opposed to violence in other relationships:
There are added risks involved in a domestic relationship, including barriers to escaping violence, complex histories and the traditional
reluctance of authorities to intervene in the “private” realm. The separation of parties in domestic violence cases,
as opposed to non-domestic disputes, often exacerbates rather than diffuses the abuse.
6.9 Domestic violence also involves issues of financial dependence, physical and emotional power and control, and shared emotional
history, which set it apart from non-domestic abuse. The situation is further complicated where there are children of the relationship.
6.10 These differences may justify separate legislation dealing with ADVOs only. Some jurisdictions have a dual regime, whereby domestic
violence and personal violence protection orders are dealt with under separate laws.
Procedurally, those laws are similar to
6.11 Legislation and practice concerning domestic violence prevention in other jurisdictions has a focus beyond restraining orders.
For example, New Zealand, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom have integrated approaches to legislation, policy, practice
and service delivery. This reflects an “international recognition that tinkering with reform in discrete sectors of the legal
system is an inadequate response”.
6.12 The New Zealand legislation serves as a useful model. The
Domestic Violence Act 1995
(NZ) has a rehabilitative focus, attempting to address the violent behaviour itself as well as delivering sanctions for breach. As
noted in Chapter 3, two of the NZ Act’s objects are to provide programs for victims of domestic violence, and to require perpetrators
to attend programs that have the primary objective of stopping or preventing domestic violence.
On the making of a protection order, the court must direct the defendant to attend a specified perpetrator program unless the court
considers that there is a good reason for not making that direction.
The programs available may be general violence prevention or anger management sessions, or may be specifically tailored so as to
meet cultural or other needs.
Free educational programs are also available to applicants (upon request made by, or on behalf of, an applicant) and their children.
A recent evaluation of the NZ Act reported that the integrated, rehabilitative focus of the Act is seen by those who have used it
as being particularly valuable.
6.13 The primary advantage of introducing separate domestic violence legislation would be to emphasise that violence within domestic
relationships involves difficult and delicate issues which do not occur in other relationships. It would also be a powerful legislative
statement of the importance of measures, such as ADVOs, in combating domestic violence. Separate legislation could also facilitate
formal links between the ADVO process and the role of police in domestic violence prevention and prosecution, Domestic Violence Liaison
Officers and other victims support services.
6.14 As with the option of separate AVO legislation, the major disadvantage of a specific law distinct from the
would be the possible perception that domestic violence offences were thereby less serious than other criminal offences. Also, legislation
which linked defendants and applicants with rehabilitation or educative programs would only be successful if adequate resources were
allocated to fund appropriate programs, and to enforce attendance by defendants.
Should the AVO provisions continue to be located in the
? Why or why not?
Should the AVO provisions be contained in separate, comprehensive legislation covering both ADVOs and APVOs? Why or why not?
What has been the effect of the split been between ADVOs and APVOs in
Should there be separate legislation covering only domestic violence? If so, should that legislation extend beyond ADVOs and take
a comprehensive, holistic approach like the
Domestic Violence Act 1995
(NZ)? Why or why not?
If separate domestic violence legislation were to be introduced, how should non-domestic violence be dealt with?

Discussion Paper 45 (2002) - Apprehended Violence Orders: Part 15A of the Crimes Act
7. Definitional issues
History of this reference (Digest)
Personal and domestic violence
Domestic relationship
7.1 In this chapter, the Commission considers the adequacy of the definitions of “personal violence”, “domestic
violence”, and “domestic relationship”.
PERSONAL AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
7.2 Part 15A provides that an ADVO or an APVO may be issued where a person has reasonable grounds to fear, and in fact fears, the
commission of a personal violence offence.
Personal violence offence is defined in
to include the commission of, or the attempt to commit, a range of offences such as murder, manslaughter, malicious wounding or damage,
assault, sexual assault and contravening an AVO.
7.3 There is no express definition of domestic violence in the
. Rather, a domestic violence offence is defined as a personal violence offence committed against a person who is in a domestic relationship
with the offender. There have been calls for AVO legislation to contain a specific definition of domestic violence, in the belief
that it would not only influence the interpretation of lawyers, courts and police, but have a wider impact in terms of “shaping
community understandings of domestic violence”.
The Model Domestic Violence Laws Report recommended that an act of domestic violence be defined as:
causing or threatening to cause a personal injury to the protected person, or the abduction or confinement of the protected person;
causing or threatening to cause damage to the protected person’s property;
causing or threatening to cause the death of, or injury to, an animal, even if the animal is not the protected person’s property;
behaving in an harassing or offensive way towards the protected person; or
stalking the protected person.
7.4 Legislation in some other jurisdictions contains definitions of personal and/or domestic violence. While the definitions differ,
they all involve some form of actual or threatened personal injury or property damage, and intimidating, harassing and otherwise
indecent or inappropriate behaviour.
The Commission is interested in hearing views on whether the current definitions in the
are adequate, or whether a definition of personal and/or domestic violence should be included in
to clarify the offences for which an AVO may be sought. Should the option of removing the AVO provisions from the
, or of creating separate domestic violence legislation, be favoured, it may be appropriate to develop a definition of personal and
domestic violence for inclusion in that legislation.
Are the current definitions of domestic and personal violence offence adequate?
Should domestic and personal violence be better defined in
DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIP
provides that people are in a domestic relationship if they:
are, or have been, married;
are, or have been, in a de facto relationship within the meaning of the
Property (Relationships) Act 1984
have, or have had, an intimate personal relationship, whether or not of a sexual nature;
are living in the same household or other residential facility;
have, or have had, a relationship where one party is dependent on the other providing ongoing paid or unpaid care; or
are, or have been, relatives.
7.6 The definition of domestic relationship is significant because it determines whether a person may apply for an ADVO or an APVO.
The definition was broadened in 1999 to include same-sex de facto partners, housemates (including tenants, boarders, and people living
in institutions or group homes), carers and former relatives, such as ex-mothers-in-law. The CLRD Discussion Paper also raised the
issue of whether the definition of domestic relationship should make specific reference to Aboriginal and other cultural traditions.
The Northern Territory legislation provides that a domestic relationship exists where someone is a relative “according to Aboriginal
tradition or contemporary social practice”.
Is the current definition of domestic relationship adequate? If not, how should it be amended?

8. Applying for an AVO
History of this reference (Digest)
How does a person apply for an AVO?
What happens in court when a person applies for an AVO?
What if it’s an emergency?
Police applications
What if the person seeking protection wants to withdraw the application?
8.1 The aim of the legislation is to ensure “that access to courts is as speedy, inexpensive, safe and simple as is consistent
with justice”.
This chapter examines the procedural aspects of applying for an AVO and asks whether the application process is adequate to fulfil
the objectives of
HOW DOES A PERSON APPLY FOR AN AVO?
8.2 Several avenues are open to people seeking advice about AVOs. They can approach a solicitor, the Chamber Magistrate at the local
court, a community legal centre or community advocacy group, a women’s refuge, the Legal Aid Commission or the police about
obtaining an AVO. The police can either apply on the person’s behalf, or can provide information about how to apply in person,
through the police Domestic Violence Liaison Officer or Victim Support Officer. In the case of domestic violence orders, applicants
can receive information and support from programs such as the Women’s Domestic Violence Court Assistance Scheme, which provides
support workers and legal representation in most Local Courts.
8.3 An application for an AVO is made by way of complaint made to an “authorised justice”,
who will usually be a Magistrate.
The Local Courts Practice and Procedure Manual states that “the role of the authorised justice is to consider the safety of
persons in need of protection (including any children), to provide information and explain court procedures and to assist the complainant
in preparing a complaint for court”.
The complaint must contain all the relevant information the court needs to decide whether to make an order.
It may be made orally or in writing.
The applicant is required to swear an oath or make an affirmation about the truth of the reasons for the order.
WHAT HAPPENS IN COURT WHEN A PERSON APPLIES FOR AN AVO?
8.4 Either the person in need of protection or the police can apply for an AVO.
If the police make the application, they arrange for the Police Prosecutor to represent the person in need of protection. People
who apply for ADVOs on their own behalf can represent themselves, or arrange for legal representation through legal aid,
the Domestic Violence Advocacy Service or by hiring their own lawyer. Legal aid is not available for APVOs, but applicants can ask
the duty solicitor for advice. Legal aid is not available for defendants in any AVO proceedings unless there are exceptional circumstances.
Interpreters are provided free of charge for people seeking AVOs.
8.5 The defendant can agree or disagree with the order being made. If the defendant agrees, the Magistrate makes the order that day.
If the defendant disagrees, the matter is scheduled for hearing at a later date. An interim order can be made for the applicant’s
protection in the meantime. If there is a criminal charge pending, the court can impose bail conditions until the matter is heard.
At the hearing, the Magistrate hears evidence from both parties, and decides whether or not to make an order.
8.6 If the police were unable to serve the defendant with the complaint and summons in time for the hearing, the case is adjourned.
This gives the police more time to serve the defendant. If the defendant has been served with the documents but fails to appear,
the Magistrate can make an AVO in the defendant’s absence. A copy of the order is given to the applicant by the court staff
and a copy is served on the defendant.
Court must explain consequences of an AVO
8.7 The legislation provides that the court must explain to the defendant and the protected person, if they are present:
(a) the effect of the order (including any prohibitions and restrictions imposed by the order), and
(b) the consequences that may follow from a contravention of the order, and
(c) the rights of the defendant and the protected person in relation to the order.
8.8 Similarly if the court varies an order, it must explain the effect of the variation and the consequences that may follow from
contravention.
The court must also provide a written explanation of these matters to both parties.
also provides that, as far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, the explanation should be given in a language that is likely
to be readily understood by the person.
8.9 It is important that both parties understand the effect of the order. A simple act such as making a telephone call may amount
to a breach, which is a criminal offence. The defendant must appreciate this in order not to breach the order inadvertently. The
protected person must also understand this so he or she can call the police if a breach occurs. There may be problems understanding
the order where, for example, one of the parties does not understand English, has poor literacy skills or has an intellectual disability.
This problem is exacerbated where court lists are crowded and the court has little time to explain the order. Understanding the order
may also be a problem where the hearing is ex parte.
8.10 The Commission would like to hear views on whether the current provisions in
regarding explaining the consequences of an AVO need expansion and clarification. For example, the legislation could state that an
authorised justice is required to explain the type of behaviour that would involve a breach of an AVO, how the AVO sits with family
law contact orders, the defendant’s right of appeal, and the procedure for varying or revoking an AVO.
WHAT IF IT’S AN EMERGENCY?
8.11 The Local Courts Practice and Procedure Manual states that urgent domestic violence applications should be identified and dealt
with expeditiously:
In domestic violence applications, local courts staff should, in consultation with the applicant, assess the urgency of the situation,
the perception of safety and the immediacy of any danger and risk to the applicant and any children prior to attending for an appointment
with a Chamber Magistrate. Appointments for urgent domestic violence applications should be provided on the same day as requested.
8.12 If the person seeking protection does not have safe accommodation for the period between the complaint being made and the hearing,
the court can make an interim order. If the complainant requests an interim order, the complaint should be placed immediately before
the court for consideration.
An interim order can be made without notice having been served on the defendant. However, the order is not enforceable until it has
been served.
8.13 The person seeking protection normally has to go to court so a Magistrate can decide whether to make an AVO or not. However,
affidavit evidence can be tendered on behalf of the person seeking protection, if the person is unable for good reason to be present,
and the matter requires urgent attention.
Police can apply for an order over the telephone, where protection is needed outside court hours.
They can direct the defendant to remain at the scene of the incident while the telephone application is made. Defendants who refuse
can be arrested and detained.
The Local Courts Practice and Procedure Manual states that although the majority of telephone interim orders are applied for after
hours, police officers can apply for telephone interim orders during business hours, when they are unable to attend the court office
to make a complaint.
provide fair and effective access to AVOs?
How can procedures for applying for AVOs better reflect the objectives of
Should the provisions requiring authorised justices to explain the consequences of granting an AVO be clarified or expanded?
Do the AVO provisions offer adequate protection in emergency situations?
POLICE APPLICATIONS
8.14 Police officers must apply for an AVO if they suspect or believe that a domestic violence,
or child abuse offence
“has recently been or is being committed, or is imminent, or is likely to be committed, against the person for whose protection
an order would be made”.
A police officer must apply for an AVO unless the person is at least 16 years of age and intends to make the complaint themselves.
Police officers need not apply if they believe there is good reason not to.
8.15 Consequently, while the legislation requires police to apply for AVOs in certain circumstances, there is still a degree of police
discretion involved. Various views have been expressed to the Commission concerning the interpretation and desirability of this discretion.
For example, some consider that police have too little discretion in applying for AVOs, and should be assisted with a protocol to
Others consider that too much discretion already exists, placing too great a burden on the person in need of protection to pursue
the matter. Particular criticism has been directed at the practice sometimes adopted of asking a victim of domestic violence, in
the presence of the perpetrator, whether she or he wants an AVO, rather than taking the decision out of the victim’s hands
and applying for one automatically.
The Commission is interested in hearing views on this matter.
How effective are the current provisions in
dealing with police applications for AVOs?
Should police have more or less discretion when applying for AVOs?
Should police discretion be more prescribed in AVO legislation?
Is the AVO application process more effective in stopping or preventing violence when police lay the complaint?
WHAT IF THE PERSON SEEKING PROTECTION WANTS TO WITHDRAW THE APPLICATION?
8.16 Applicants can withdraw from proceedings before a final order is made. If the police apply for an order on behalf of a person
in need of protection, only the police can withdraw the application. The Local Courts Practice and Procedure Manual advises that
people who do not want the proceedings to go ahead can discuss their concerns with the police officer who made the application, the
Police Prosecutor or the Police Domestic Violence Liaison Officer. Local Court staff also provide information to people who enquire
advice before withdrawing from proceedings.
8.17 It is estimated that approximately 40% of AVO applications are withdrawn or dismissed prior to the final hearing.
As noted in Chapter 4, this figure is open to a number of interpretations. For example, some commentators claim that this indicates
that the applications were not soundly enough based to begin with, while others argue that the rate of withdrawal could reflect factors
such as pressure on the applicant from the defendant, family, friends or the community, fear of reprisal, or uncertainty concerning
legal processes, or technical problems such as failing to serve the summons on the defendant.
8.18 While the reason why so many applications fail to proceed is matter of speculation, the high number of withdrawals is nevertheless
an issue of concern. Some AVO applications would be withdrawn because the threat of violence had ceased or diminished. However, it
is fair to say that, in at least some cases, people in danger of experiencing violence, particularly domestic violence, are withdrawing
AVO applications out of fear. It is indeed arguable that it is in the worst cases of violence, where this fear is greatest, that
the withdrawal of an application may be more likely. This presents a problem for police trying to stop the incidence of violence,
as it will be harder for them to establish the need for an AVO if they don’t have the co-operation of the person in need of
protection.
8.19 The prevention of domestic and personal violence is a matter of public interest, not just a private matter. Accordingly, there
is an argument that police should be able to proceed with an AVO application where they have reasonable grounds to believe that there
is an imminent threat of violence, even in the face of strong reluctance by the applicant. This would, however, need to be balanced
with the undesirability of overpowering the will of the applicant. The Commission would like to hear views on this matter.
Given that the primary objective of
is to protect victims of violence, are the provisions relating to the withdrawal of AVO applications satisfactory?
Should the legislation require certain criteria to be satisfied before an application can be withdrawn?
If so, what should those criteria be?
Should police be able to proceed with an AVO application without the consent of the applicant in certain circumstances?

Discussion Paper 45 (2002) - Apprehended Violence Orders: Part 15A of the Crimes Act
9. AVOs and vulnerable groups
History of this reference (Digest)
Impact on vulnerable groups
9.1 This chapter considers the impact of the AVO provisions on people who may be more vulnerable than others, either because circumstance
makes them potentially more susceptible to violence or abuse, or because they are less likely to be in a position to benefit from
obtaining an AVO.
9.2 Previous studies have revealed some of the reasons why people have not applied for AVOs. Some of those reasons relate to the procedural
aspects of AVOs, such as lack of knowledge concerning law and practice, a lack of confidence in the police or the justice system
or concerns about the cost of the process. Other reasons were more personal ones. For example, some people feared the consequences
that may follow applying for an AVO, such as violent reprisals from the defendant, the impact on children and the financial repercussions
for the applicant if the defendant were removed from the home. There may also be feelings of shame or embarrassment associated with
bringing violence and abuse into the “public” arena, or pressure from family, friends, or the local community to remain
quiet. In other cases, the mere threat of applying for an AVO may have been sufficient to stop the violent behaviour.
IMPACT ON VULNERABLE GROUPS
9.3 For some groups, the problems associated with applying for an AVO may be more difficult than for others. This may be because some
people are in more vulnerable positions than others. It may also be because particular barriers may exist for some people or groups
of people that make it more difficult to gain access to violence-prevention measures such as AVOs.
9.4 An evaluation of the
Domestic Violence Act 1995
(NZ) made the following observation:
There are people who need the protection of the Act but tend not to make applications in proportion to their need. Those most frequently
mentioned were victims of domestic violence who are: on low incomes but above the threshold for legal aid; Maori; Pacific people;
people of other cultures; men; people in same-gender relationships; and victims with gang associations.
9.5 The ability to gain access to AVOs is a significant factor contributing to the effectiveness or otherwise of the legislation.
The following paragraphs raise issues concerning particular difficulties that may be experienced by some people. It is not an exhaustive
list. The Commission is interested in hearing about other problems that some sections of society may experience in gaining access
to AVOs, and suggestions for overcoming them.
Indigenous people
9.6 Reports in Australia have indicated that violence is significantly higher in Indigenous communities than in the general population,
and is apparently increasing.
A significant amount of violence is believed to go unreported, due to shame, fear of reprisals, lack of information or lack of support.
Indigenous people have also consistently been over-represented in the criminal justice system, and their contact with the criminal
law is an ongoing issue of concern.
Due to this, the victim may distrust police, or may fear that the perpetrator will be imprisoned. A Queensland review of domestic
violence orders noted that:
may be ineffectual due to the way they have been constructed, implemented and enforced, based on ethnocentric and racial values. Some
Indigenous women may only want ‘time out’ from the perpetrator with alcohol and substance abuse counselling and anger
management programs enforced, rather than removal, containment or incarceration of their spouse.
9.7 Although AVOs are not criminal measures in themselves, their association with the criminal law may make them a less attractive
option for Indigenous people seeking to prevent violence.
An alternative may be to provide for a “cooling off” order, whereby the offender is temporarily removed from the home,
giving time for the explosiveness of the situation to subside.
People from non-English speaking backgrounds
9.8 Similar problems can exist regarding people from non-English speaking backgrounds. In some cultures it is inappropriate for a
woman to take action against a family member. Shame or fear of reprisals may prevent some women from seeking legal assistance. Some
victims may not be aware of their legal rights, as they differ from those recognised by other cultures. Victims may be reluctant
to use the legal system as a result of experiences with police or courts in other countries. They may consider that their experience
is normal, or that it is not serious enough to warrant legal intervention.
People in rural and remote areas
9.9 There is a higher incidence of domestic violence in rural and remote communities than in urban areas.
Specific groups which experience a high incidence of domestic violence include indigenous women, young women and women living on
farms, stations or in mining communities. The prevalence of firearms in regional areas also increases vulnerability to violence.
Geographic, social and economic isolation compound the difficulties for people who experience violence in accessing legal protection.
Victims do not have access to the support networks, alternative housing or other services which are available in metropolitan areas.
Those who have no access to money, transport or telecommunications have very limited options. Enforced isolation may become another
element of the perpetrator’s control over the victim.
9.10 AVOs may be of limited use where court hearings are held only infrequently, and access to legal advice and representation are
limited. Court assistance and advocacy programs are often unavailable. Confidentiality can also be a problem in smaller communities,
where many people, including the police or court staff, may know the perpetrator. The thought of airing disputes publicly may also
deter people in regional areas from applying for AVOs.
People with a disability
9.11 People with a disability may experience a number of difficulties gaining access to AVOs. There may be practical or procedural
considerations such as the need to provide documents in alternative formats or to explain clearly what AVOs entail. Other difficulties
may emerge due to circumstances which may make people with a disability more susceptible to violence. People with an intellectual
disability living in group homes may be particularly vulnerable to violence.
9.12 In some circumstances, people with an intellectual disability or a mental illness may lack capacity to apply for an AVO on their
own behalf. Currently, Part 15A provides only for applications to be made by a police officer or the applicant themselves, where
that person is over the age of 16 years.
It has been suggested that the legislation should be amended to allow for third parties, such as parents, friends, or the Protective
Commissioner or Guardianship Board, to apply on behalf of people with an intellectual disability or mental illness.
Provisions of this nature exist in other jurisdictions.
The benefit of this approach is that it would provide greater access to AVOs for people with a disability. The major drawback is
that it would remove autonomy from people with a disability, and may be used inappropriately: for example, by parents to interfere
with the rights of adult children to form relationships.
The Commission would like to hear views on this matter.
Older people
9.13 Older people who are frail and dependent on others may be particularly vulnerable to abuse.
difficult where an older person is being abused by his or her carer, as the only alternative may be institutionalised care. This
may deter older people from seeking legal assistance.
9.14 Older people who fear violence may face additional obstacles when seeking help. They are more likely to suffer from social isolation,
and are less likely to be able to communicate effectively. Their allegations may not be taken seriously, especially if they suffer
from some form of dementure.
Children and young people
9.15 Children and young people are particularly vulnerable to abuse, both in terms of experiencing it themselves and witnessing others
being abused. In situations of domestic violence, children are often exposed to abuse by their parents, or witness one parent abusing
Even where they are not directly experiencing it or witnessing it, children are usually aware that it is occurring. Children who
are exposed to domestic violence often suffer from low self esteem, poor conflict resolution skills, increased levels of anxiety
9.16 Allegations of violence against children are most frequently raised in the Family Court where one parent is attempting to prevent
the other from having contact with the children. The primary function of the Family Court in proceedings related to children is to
determine what is in the best interests of the child in all the circumstances of the case. The law clearly recognises and appreciates
the damage caused to children not only in becoming the victims of violence but also in witnessing it.
9.17 In matters concerning children, State and Territory governments are responsible for the protection of children and adolescents
from abuse. In NSW, causing physical injury, sexual abuse [or other harm] is an offence under s 227 of the
Children (Care and Protection) Act 1998
Part 15A imposes an obligation on the police to apply for an AVO when a child has suffered such abuse.
Part 15A also makes provision for an application for an order for the protection of children to be heard in the absence of the public.
Further, children are not required to give direct evidence in proceedings unless such evidence is essential.
What problems do some people experience in terms of gaining access to AVOs?
How can AVO legislation help to overcome those disadvantages?
Should third parties be able to apply for an AVO on behalf of people who may have difficulty making an application themselves? Why
or why not?
Are the existing provisions in Part 15A aimed at safeguarding the interests and identity of children during the AVO process adequate?

10. Granting an AVO
History of this reference (Digest)
Issuing an AVO
10.1 This chapter examines the types of AVOs that may be granted by a court, and whether the current grounds on which AVOs may be
granted are satisfactory. It also looks at the adequacy of the provisions stating the circumstances in which the court
make an AVO, and when it
make an AVO.

10.2 An interim order can be made for the period between making the complaint and the hearing. An interim order can be an ADVO or
an APVO. It can be made whether or not the defendant is present, and whether or not the defendant has been given notice of the proceedings.
The court may admit affidavit evidence tendered on behalf of the applicant if he or she is unable to be present, and the matter requires
urgent attention.
10.3 If an interim order is made, the court summons the defendant to appear at a further hearing as soon as practicable after the
order is made. This hearing is to decide if a final order should be made. The court may confirm, vary or revoke the interim order,
whether or not the defendant appears at the further hearing.
While in force, an interim order has the same effect as a final order.
The clerk of the court can make or extend an interim AVO where both parties consent.
When does an interim order start?
10.4 A defendant cannot be found guilty of an offence of contravening an interim AVO unless he or she has been served with a copy
of the order, or was present when the order was made.
This means that if the defendant is present in court when an interim order is made, it is enforceable immediately. If the defendant
is not present in court when an interim order is made, it is not enforceable until the defendant is served with a copy of the order.
How long does an interim order last?
10.5 There is no limitation on how long an interim AVO can last under
It simply remains in force until it is withdrawn, dismissed or revoked, or until a final order is made.
10.6 Since an interim AVO may impose significant restrictions on the defendant, the hearing should be held as soon as possible after
it is made. However, interim orders may in fact last for months, or even years. This is a concern given that the defendant may not
have had the opportunity to contest the order. Some jurisdictions have addressed this concern by placing time limits on the duration
of interim orders.
10.7 In other jurisdictions, the legislation provides for the automatic conversion of interim orders into final orders. For example,
in Western Australia, the complainant elects whether the initial hearing should be held in the absence of the defendant.
At the initial hearing, the court may make an interim order (up to three months) or a “cooling off” order (up to 72 hours).
If an interim order is made, the defendant has 21 days to object, in which case the matter is set down for hearing. If there is no
objection, the interim order automatically crystallises into a final order.
There is a presumption in favour of finalising the order, although the defendant’s right to contest the order is preserved.
This approach is intended to save people in need of protection from the pressure of having to pursue the matter and make unnecessary
court appearances.
10.8 The New Zealand model adopts a similar approach. A protection order is first issued as a “temporary order”. The respondent
may give notice of his or her intention to defend the order. If no such notice is given then, after three months, the order automatically
becomes a final order.
Research had indicated that many respondents do not defend temporary orders, and so a high proportion become final orders.
On what grounds can the court make an interim order?
10.9 An interim order can be made “if it appears to the court that it is necessary or appropriate to do so in the circumstances”.
The legislation gives little guidance to the court on how to exercise this power. Whether an order is deemed necessary or appropriate
will vary between cases and between Magistrates. Although the legislation does not refer to the urgency of the situation, some Magistrates
may consider that it is only necessary or appropriate to make an interim order where danger is imminent.
10.10 Other Australian jurisdictions employ more specific tests for granting interim orders.
An issue for consideration in this review is whether it may be desirable to clarify the grounds for obtaining interim orders under
What terms can an interim order include?
10.11 An interim AVO “may impose such prohibitions or restrictions on the behaviour of the defendant as appear necessary or
desirable to the court”.
The terms that can be included are the same for interim and final orders, and are discussed below at paragraph 10.26.
Should the legislation limit the duration of interim AVOs?
Should the grounds for an interim AVO be clarified?
Should an interim AVO automatically convert to a final order after a specified time period?
Telephone interim orders
10.12 To ensure the safety and protection of people who experience violence, AVOs must be available at all hours. Police can apply
for an interim order by telephone when it is not practicable for a court to make an immediate order because of the time or place
at which the incident occurs. Telephone interim orders (“TIOs”) are available 24 hours a day. Although most are made
outside court hours, TIOs are available during business hours if the police are unable to attend the court to make the complaint.
Only police are permitted to apply for TIOs.
10.13 To apply for a TIO, the police officer attending an incident must have “good reason to believe an order is necessary to
ensure the safety of the person who would be protected by the order or to prevent substantial damage to any property of that person”.
Police officers must apply for a TIO if they suspect or believe that domestic violence, stalking or child abuse “has recently
been or is being committed, or is imminent, or is likely to be committed, against the person for whose protection an order would
unless the person is at least 16 years of age and intends to make the complaint themselves. Police officers need not apply if they
believe there is good reason not to.
10.14 An application for a TIO is taken to have the same effect as any other AVO application, and is to contain a summons to the defendant
to attend court for a hearing at a specified date.
It must be served personally on the defendant by a police officer as soon as practicable after it is made.
A TIO lasts 14 days, unless the court revokes it, makes an interim order or dismisses the application for an AVO. If the closest
local court is not sitting within the 14 day period, it may be extended to 28 days.
On what grounds can the court make a TIO?
10.15 In deciding whether to make a TIO, an authorised justice need only consider whether “there are reasonable grounds for
Presumably the authorised justice will have regard to the intention of the legislation, which is to ensure the safety and protection
of persons who experience violence. In making the decision the authorised justice will have to assess the reasonableness of the police
officer’s belief that an order is necessary to ensure the safety of the person or prevent substantial damage to the person’s
What terms can a TIO include?
10.16 A TIO states that the defendant “must not assault, molest, harass, threaten or otherwise interfere with the protected
Unless otherwise ordered, it also specifies that the defendant is prohibited from intimidating or stalking the protected person.
If the police officer who applies for the order has good reason to believe the person in need of protection is in imminent danger
of personal injury, the TIO can:
prohibit or restrict the defendant from approaching that person or the person’s home, work or other premises, whether or not
the defendant has a legal or equitable interest in the premises;
prohibit or restrict the defendant from approaching the protected person or their home within 12 hours of consuming alcohol or drugs;
prohibit the defendant from destroying or deliberately damaging or interfering with the protected person’s property.
10.17 The Commission is interested to hear whether the terms of a TIO as prescribed in
are sufficient to protect against actual or threatened violence. In particular, the Commission would like to hear views on whether
a TIO provides adequate protection against damage to property. As noted above, a TIO may be issued to ensure the safety of the applicant
prevent substantial damage to the applicant’s property. Yet, the terms of a TIO may prohibit or restrict the destruction of,
deliberate damage to, or interference with the applicant’s property
where a police officer has good reason to believe the safety of the applicant is in imminent danger. This is out of step with ordinary
interim and final AVOs, which may be issued where the intimidation or harassment amounts only to actual or threatened damage to property
belonging to, or in the possession of, the applicant.
Are the provisions regarding TIOs sufficient to protect people experiencing violence?
Are the grounds for and terms of TIOs adequate?
Do TIOs adequately protect against damage to the applicant’s property?
Final orders
10.18 A final order can be made where both parties consent to the order, or, where the order is contested, after a hearing. As noted
does not provide for the automatic conversion of interim orders into final orders.
When does a final order start?
10.19 As with interim orders, final AVOs are not effective until the defendant has been served with a copy of the order, or was
present when the order was made.
The applicant may be protected by an interim order, until the final order is served on the defendant.
How long does a final order last?
10.20 An final AVO remains in force for the period specified by the court. This is to be as long as is necessary to ensure the protection
of the applicant. If no period is specified, the order remains in force for 6 months.
On what grounds can the court make a final order?
10.21 The court may make an AVO where the person to be protected has reasonable grounds to fear and in fact fears:
(a) the commission by the other person of a personal violence offence against the person, or
(b) the engagement of the other person in conduct amounting to harassment or molestation of the person, being conduct that, in the
opinion of the court, is sufficient to warrant the making of the order, or
(c) the engagement of the other person in conduct in which the other person:
(i) intimidates the person or a person with whom the person has a domestic relationship, or
(ii) stalks the person,
being conduct that, in the opinion of the court, is sufficient to warrant the making of the order.
10.22 These grounds are both subjective and objective: the court must be satisfied that there are “reasonable grounds”
to fear personal violence, and that the applicant does in fact fear the defendant. If the subjective element is missing, an AVO will
not be granted.
There are three exceptions to this. First, where the applicant is under 16; secondly, where the applicant has a general intelligence
function which is appreciably below average, or thirdly, where the defendant consents to the AVO.
10.23 The grounds for making a final order are quite broad. Conduct may amount to harassment or molestation even though it does not
involve actual or threatened violence. It also includes actual or threatened damage to property belonging to, or in possession of,
the person to be protected.
10.24 While some jurisdictions use the “reasonable fear” test,
others focus on a specific act of violence and the likelihood of it happening again.
Some combine the “reasonable fear” and “specific act” tests.
The models which concentrate on a specific act of violence focus more on the objective conduct of the respondent and less on the
subjective perceptions of the applicant. This test has been criticised because it requires the applicant to have suffered violence
before an order will be granted.
However, where the definition of violence is broad, and includes threats, intimidation and harassment, there is no requirement that
physical violence occur before an order will be granted. The “specific act” test has also been criticised where it demands
the applicant show the behaviour “is likely” to happen again before an order will be granted.
This additional requirement may deny protection to those where violence is not “likely” but is still a real possibility.
10.25 Although
focuses on “reasonable fear” rather than specific acts, applicants do give evidence of specific acts of violence in order
to satisfy the court they have reasonable grounds to fear and in fact fear violence. In practice, there is considerable overlap between
the different approaches. However, the “reasonable fear” test may be easier to satisfy because evidence of behaviour
beyond threats, intimidation and acts of violence may give rise to reasonable fear, for example evidence that the respondent has
an explosive temper and is skilled in martial arts.
What terms can a final order include?
10.26 A final order “may impose such prohibitions or restrictions on the behaviour of the defendant as appear necessary or
desirable”.
Unless otherwise ordered, every AVO prohibits the defendant from intimidating or stalking the protected person.
An order can prohibit the defendant from approaching that person or the person’s home, work or other premises. It can prohibit
or restrict any specified behaviour which might affect the protected person. It can also prohibit the possession of firearms.
Is the default duration of 6 months for a final order appropriate?
Are the grounds for a final order adequate?
Should the criteria in the legislation for obtaining an AVO be more specific? If so, how?
How workable and effective are the prohibitions and restrictions that may be included in an AVO?
Orders made by consent
10.27 A court can make an AVO without being satisfied that the complainant has reasonable grounds to fear and in fact fears domestic
or personal violence, if both parties consent to the making of the order. By consenting to the order, the defendant does not admit
to any of the particulars of the complaint. Where the parties consent, the court can only conduct a hearing if the order is a final
order and it is in the interests of justice to do so.
10.28 Both interim and final orders can be made by consent. The clerk of the court can make or extend an interim order where both
parties consent.
However, only the court can make a final order.
One issue to be considered is whether the clerk of the court should be able to issue final AVOs where both parties consent.
10.29 Granting AVOs by consent is expedient as the matter does not have to proceed to a final hearing. Also, the applicant benefits
from immediate protection without having to wait for the order to be served on the defendant. However, there is the risk of parties
not understanding all the consequences that will flow from an AVO.
Are the provisions allowing for AVOs to be made with the consent of both parties operating fairly and effectively?
Should clerks of the court be able to issue final AVOs by consent?
Ex parte orders
10.30 When an initial complaint is made, the defendant is served with a copy of the complaint and a summons to attend court at a particular
date and time. If the defendant is present when an order is made, the clerk will serve a copy of the order personally on the defendant,
or can arrange for the order to be sent by post. If the defendant does not attend court, an order can be made ex parte. A copy of
the order is then served on the defendant by a police officer or such other person as the clerk thinks fit. Service can be affected
in other manners, “as the court directs”.
10.31 Service is important because defendants cannot be charged with contravention of an AVO unless they have been served with a copy
of the order. An AVO does not afford any protection until it has been served on the defendant. If the defendant cannot be located,
the order provides no protection, even if the defendant knows of its existence. This can be a problem, especially in regional areas,
for example if the defendant leaves for long periods of time for work.
Are the current provisions relating to service effective?
Standard orders
10.32 While courts have total discretion as to the terms of an interim or final AVO, they tend to rely on standard order forms which
contain a checklist of commonly used terms.
The Local Courts Practice and Procedure Manual states that the use of standard orders promotes consistency and efficiency, and clarifies
the order for the parties, court staff and police. Reliance on standard orders means police records are easier to maintain and orders
are easier to enforce. Importantly, Magistrates still have the option of tailoring orders to the circumstances of each case.
10.33 The standard orders were written following consultation with Magistrates, lawyers and domestic violence agencies. However, they
are not contained in the legislation, and may vary from court to court. For the sake of consistency, it may be desirable to include
the standard orders in a schedule to the AVO legislation, or prescribe them by regulation. The Commission seeks views on this matter.
Are the standard orders adequate? If not, how should they be revised?
Should the standard orders be incorporated as a schedule to the AVO legislation?
ISSUING AN AVO
10.34 The legislation states that, if the grounds for making an order are satisfied, the court “may” make an AVO.
In relation to APVO proceedings, the court has a broader discretion to refuse to issue process.
In some circumstances, the court “must” make an order.
Whether a court will make an order may also depend on whether or not bail is granted.
When must the court make an AVO?
10.35 The court must make an AVO when a defendant pleads guilty to, or is found guilty of, a domestic violence offence or an offence
involving intimidation or stalking.
Similarly, a court must make an interim AVO when a person is charged with one of those offences.
In these cases the court must make the order unless it is not required, for example because an order has already been made or because
the person in need of protection opposes the making of the order.
When can the court choose whether or not to make an AVO?
provides that, on complaint, a court “may” make an AVO.
In deciding whether or not to make an order, the court is required to consider certain factors. If the order is going to prohibit
or restrict access to the defendant’s residence, the court must consider:
(a) the accommodation needs of all relevant parties, and
(b) the effect of making an order on any children living or ordinarily living at the residence, and
(c) the consequences for the person for whose protection the order would be made and any children living or ordinarily living at the
residence if an order restricting access by the defendant to the residence is not made.
10.37 A person who applies for, or applies to vary, an AVO must inform the court of any relevant family law contact order, or any
application for such an order that may be pending.
In deciding whether to make or vary an AVO, the court must:
(a) consider whether contact between the protected person, or between the defendant, and any child of either of those persons is relevant
to the making or variation of the order, and
(b) have regard to any relevant family contact order of which the court has been informed.
10.38 The legislation in some other jurisdictions is more prescriptive, giving the courts more structured guidance.
Are the circumstances in which the court must make an AVO appropriate?
Should the legislation be more specific about the factors the court must consider before making an order?
Should the legislation indicate how the factors should be weighted?
Should different factors be listed for consideration in applications for interim, telephone interim and final orders?

For example, in the Australian Capital Territory, an interim order remains in force for up to 16 weeks where it is made by consent,
and otherwise up to 8 weeks. It can be extended for up to 8 weeks, as long as it will not be in force for more than 16 weeks in total.

In the ACT, the court can make an order if “it is necessary … to ensure the safety of the aggrieved person until the
application for a final order is decided”:
Protection Orders Act 2001
(ACT) s 49. In Queensland, a temporary order can be made “only if it appears to the court … that an act of domestic violence
has been committed against the aggrieved spouse by the respondent spouse”:
Domestic Violence (Family Protection) Act 1989
(Qld) s 39A(1). In Victoria, the court can make an interim intervention order if it is “necessary to ensure the safety of the
aggrieved family member or to preserve any property of the aggrieved family member pending the hearing and determination of the complaint”:
Crimes (Family Violence) Act 1987
(Vic) s 8(1). The Tasmanian test is less precise, stating that justices may make an interim order, “if they see sufficient cause
to do so”, whether or not they are satisfied of any of the matters alleged:
Justices Act 1959
In Western Australia, the grounds for an interim order are the same as for a final order – the court must be satisfied that,
unless restrained, the respondent is “likely” to commit a personal offence against the applicant, or behave in a manner
that could cause fear of such an offence. The order must also be appropriate in the circumstances:

in force for a specified period, or 2 years if no period is specified. A longer order can be made in special or exceptional circumstances:
Protection Orders Act 2001
(ACT) s 35. A final personal protection order remains in force for a specified period, or 1 year if no period is specified: s 36.
In the Northern Territory, the order remains in force for the specified period:
Domestic Violence Act 1992
(NT) s 4(1A). In Queensland, a domestic violence order remains in force for a specified period of up to 2 years. In special circumstances,
the court can specify a longer period:
Domestic Violence (Family Protection) Act 1989
(Qld) s 34. In Tasmania, the order remains in force for whatever period the court considers necessary to protect the person for whose
benefit the order is made:
Justices Act 1959
In Victoria, an intervention order remains in force for the period specified or, if no period is specified, until it is revoked:
Crimes (Family Violence) Act 1987
(Vic) s 6. In Western Australia, a final violence restraining order remains in force for the specified period or, if no period is
specified, for 2 years:

South Australia also uses the “reasonable fear” test. There, the court may make a domestic violence restraining order
if there is a reasonable apprehension that the defendant may, unless restrained, commit domestic violence, and the court is satisfied
that the making of the order is appropriate in the circumstances. “Domestic violence” includes personal injury, damage
to property, or certain other types of behaviour which reasonably arouse apprehension or fear in the family member:
Domestic Violence Act 1994
In deciding whether to make an order, the court must consider, as factors of primary importance, the need to ensure family members
are protected from domestic violence and the welfare of any children affected. It must also have regard to the accommodation needs
of family members, any relevant family contact order, how a restraining order would affect contact, any hardship that may be caused,
the income and assets of the defendant, any other legal proceedings between the parties and any other matter which is relevant in
the circumstances of the case:
In the ACT, the court need only be satisfied that the respondent has engaged in domestic violence before making an order. In the
case of personal violence, the court must be satisfied that the respondent has engaged in personal violence towards the aggrieved
person and may do so again:
Protection Orders Act 2001
(ACT) s 40. Domestic and personal violence include physical injury, damage to property, threats, harassment and offensive behaviour.
Domestic violence also includes certain “domestic violence offences”: s 9 and s 10. In Queensland, the court can make
a domestic violence order if it is satisfied that the respondent has committed domestic violence against the aggrieved spouse, and
is likely to again:
Domestic Violence (Family Protection) Act 1989
(Qld) s 20. “Domestic violence” includes wilful injury, property damage, intimidation or harassment, indecent behaviour
or a threat to commit any of these: s 11. In Tasmania, the court must be satisfied that a person has caused personal injury or property
damage, or has behaved in a provocative or offensive manner, and is likely to do so again. Restraint orders are also available for
Justices Act 1959
In Victoria, the court may make an intervention order if it is satisfied that the person has assaulted, threatened, harassed, molested
or behaved in an offensive manner towards a family member or damaged his or her property, and is likely to do so again:
Crimes (Family Violence) Act 1987
In Western Australia, the court may make a violence restraining order if it is satisfied that, unless restrained, the respondent
is likely to commit a personal offence against the applicant, or behave in a manner that could cause fear that of such an offence.
Granting a violence restraining order must also be appropriate in the circumstances:
Restraining Orders Act 1997
(WA) s 11. The court may make a misconduct restraining order if it is satisfied that the respondent is likely to behave in a manner
that is intimidating or offensive to the applicant, cause damage to property in the applicant’s possession or behave in a manner
that breaches the peace. Granting a misconduct restraining order must also be appropriate in the circumstances: s 34. The Northern
Territory also has a mixed test. The court may make a restraining order where it is satisfied that the defendant has assaulted, caused
personal injury or damaged property and is likely to do so again, or has threatened to assault, cause personal injury or damage property
and is likely to repeat or carry out the threat. The court may also make an order where the defendant has behaved in a provocative
or offensive manner and the behaviour is likely to lead to a breach of the peace, including behaviour that may cause reasonable fear
of violence or harassment:

For example, the ACT legislation states that the paramount consideration in deciding whether to make a protection order is the need
to ensure that the aggrieved person is protected from domestic or personal violence:
Protection Orders Act 2001
(ACT) s 6(1)(a). The court must also consider the welfare of children who may be affected by the defendant’s behaviour, the
accommodation needs of the aggrieved person and any children, any hardship that may be caused by the making of the order, the income
and assets of the defendant and aggrieved person, whether contact between the aggrieved person or the defendant and any child of
either of them is relevant, any previous domestic or personal violence committed by the defendant, any previous protection orders
and any previous contraventions, the need to ensure property is protected from damage, and anything else that is relevant: s 41.
A protection order must be as unrestrictive on the personal rights and liberties of the defendant as possible, while still achieving
the objects of the Act: s 6(2). In South Australia, the court must consider, as factors of primary importance, the need to ensure
family members are protected from domestic violence and the welfare of any children affected. It must also have regard to the accommodation
needs of family members, any relevant family contact order, how a restraining order would affect contact, any hardship that may be
caused, the income and assets of the defendant, any other legal proceedings between the parties and any other matter which is relevant
in the circumstances of the case:
Domestic Violence Act 1994
In Western Australia, the court must consider, as matters of primary importance in violence restraining order proceedings, the need
to ensure the applicant is protected from personal violence, the need to prevent behaviour that causes fear of personal violence
and the welfare of any children affected. It must also consider the accommodation needs of the parties, any hardship that may be
caused, any family orders, any other current legal proceedings between the parties, the defendant’s criminal record, any previous
similar behaviour and any other relevant matters:
Restraining Orders Act 1997
(WA) s 12. In Tasmania, the paramount consideration is the protection and welfare of the person for whose benefit the order is sought.
The court must also consider any relevant family contact order, and whether access between the parties and any child who is a member
of the family of either party is relevant to the making of the order:
Justices Act 1959
s 106B(4AAB).
Discussion Paper 45 (2002) - Apprehended Violence Orders: Part 15A of the Crimes Act
11. Consequences of an AVO
History of this reference (Digest)
What happens after the court makes an AVO?
What if the defendant breaches the AVO?
What happens if the applicant contributes to the breach?
11.1 This chapter discusses the consequences that the granting of an AVO may have for both the applicant and the defendant. Because
breaching an AVO is a criminal offence, the consequences for the defendant are potentially quite serious.
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE COURT MAKES AN AVO?
Consequences for the applicant
11.2 An AVO protects the person from violence. Importantly, it provides protection from behaviour which is not in itself criminal,
such as threats or unwanted communication. Applying for an AVO is also likely to empower a victim of violence, as it moves the issue
from the private to the public realm, and indicates to the defendant that violence will not be tolerated.
Consequences for the defendant
11.3 The consequences for the defendant can be significant. For example, defendants can be prevented from residing in, or restricted
in approaching, their homes. An AVO is a civil order so it does not give the defendant a criminal record. However, a record of the
order is kept on a police database.
11.4 Defendants must dispose of any firearms in their possession or surrender them to the police,
and a licence or a permit to possess a firearm must not be issued to a person who is, or who has, at any time within 10 years before
the licence or permit application was made, been subject to an AVO.
A licence or a permit is also automatically suspended when an interim AVO is taken out against the licence or permit holder,
and automatically revoked if the interim AVO becomes final.
This will be significant where the defendant requires a firearms licence for work, for example, defendants in rural areas or who
work as security guards.
11.5 A defendant is also disqualified from serving on a jury for the duration of the AVO.
WHAT IF THE DEFENDANT BREACHES THE AVO?
Consequences for the applicant
11.6 It is a crime to breach an AVO.
If the defendant breaches any of the terms in the order, the applicant should report the breach to the police. Police are instructed
to “treat all breaches of AVOs seriously, no matter how minor”.
Police can take immediate action, for example by removing the defendant from the protected person’s house. They should also
investigate the breach, take evidence and lay a charge. If the police believe that the defendant has breached an AVO, they can arrest
and detain the defendant without a warrant.
11.7 Effective police response is the key to ensuring the safety of the protected person. The effectiveness of AVOs may be undermined
where police response is inadequate. Police are advised not to mediate or counsel parties as a substitute for charging.
In practice, however, police may take informal action only, such as warning the perpetrator.
Difficulties can arise for the police where there is insufficient evidence to support a charge.
Consequences for the defendant
11.8 A defendant who breaches any of the terms in the order may be arrested and charged with an offence. If the police believe that
a person has breached an AVO, they can arrest and detain the person without a warrant,
and as soon as is practicable bring the person before a court.
11.9 It is not an offence unless the defendant was in court when the order was made, or has been served with a copy of it.
Further, the defendant must “knowingly” contravene the order.
This means that the defendant must be aware of the circumstances that make the behaviour illegal. A defendant who inadvertently breaches
the order, for example by entering a building without knowing the protected person is inside, will not be guilty of an offence.
11.10 Conduct constituting a breach may be a criminal offence in itself, for example a physical assault. Where an offender is sentenced
for assault, the existence of an AVO may be an aggravating factor.
Alternatively, conduct which is otherwise lawful will be criminal if it amounts to a contravention of the civil order. For example,
telephoning the protected person will be a criminal offence where the AVO states that the defendant must not contact the protected
person. It is no defence that the protected person initiated the breach.
11.11 The maximum penalty for breaching an AVO is 2 years imprisonment, a fine of $5,500, or both.
If the breach involves violence by a defendant who is 18 years or over, the defendant
be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, unless the court orders otherwise. The court must give reasons if the offender is not imprisoned.
There is a concern about the appropriateness of fines as penalty for breaching an AVO. For example, where the parties live together
and share a household income, the applicant would effectively be paying part of the fine. Further, a fine may trivialise the seriousness
of the breach.
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE APPLICANT CONTRIBUTES TO THE BREACH?
11.12 Under
, breaching an AVO is still a crime, even if the applicant contributes to the breach. For example, if the AVO prohibits the defendant
from entering the premises, it will not be a defence that he or she was invited in by the applicant.
11.13 In one survey, police officers were asked how often they considered that applicants contributed to a breach of an AVO. It was
reported that some police officers “believe women have some role in the breach of the AVO”.
Further, a majority of the police officers surveyed indicated they would consider charging the applicant for aiding or abetting the
where he or she provoked the defendant, or encouraged the defendant to breach the AVO.
Consent as a defence
11.14 Western Australia is the only Australian jurisdiction that currently provides for consent as a defence to a breach:
It is a defence to a charge of breaching a restraining order for the person who is bound by the order to satisfy the court that the
person acted with the consent … of the person protected by the order.
11.15 “Consent” must be freely and voluntarily given. It does not include consent obtained by force, threat, intimidation,
deceit, or any fraudulent means.
The defence is not available where the protected person is a child or someone for whom a guardian has been appointed.
Further, the court may revoke the restraining order where the defence is established.
11.16 The defence was included because in some circumstances, there may be a genuine reason for breaching a restraining order. For
example, there may be an emergency such as a funeral or a child’s operation, where there is no time to go to the court for
a variation.
In other circumstances, the parties may have reconciled without seeking a variation or revocation. It would also provide a defence
where the applicant contributed to or encouraged the breach.
11.17 The inclusion of the defence in the Western Australian legislation was controversial. It was argued that, because domestic violence
often involves a power imbalance between the victim and perpetrator, the defence would further the interests of perpetrators and
would weaken the legal position of people in need of protection.
There was some concern that a defence of consent might undermine the whole purpose of the restraining order legislation, creating
“a huge loophole in what is otherwise very sound and well-constructed legislation”.
11.18 The consent defence has reportedly made enforcement difficult, as police are uncertain when to take action for a breach.
The Auditor General for Western Australia reported recently that police are instructed not to charge for a breach where they are satisfied
that the applicant consented.
The Western Australian Department of Justice has recommended the removal of consent as a defence.
Instead, orders should permit a degree of contact agreed by both parties, which could be varied by the normal processes.
Model Domestic Violence Laws Report
did not support including consent as a defence to a breach of a protection order:
Submissions were largely opposed to this defence being incorporated into the Model Laws because of concerns that the “consent”
may often have been a response to a fear or a threat. Further, it was stated in submissions that the defence failed to acknowledge
that a domestic violence order is an order of a court, and not an agreement between two individuals which is capable of being varied
Are the provisions relating to the breach of AVOs appropriate?
Are they adequately enforced?
Are the penalties for breaching an AVO appropriate?
Should there be defences to the breach provisions?
In particular, should consent be a defence?

12. Miscellaneous issues
History of this reference (Digest)
Cross applications
Multiple applications
Variation and revocation
The appeals process
12.1 This chapter examines miscellaneous practical issues concerning AVOs, such as cross applications, variation and revocation, costs
and the appeals process.
CROSS APPLICATIONS
12.2 A cross application is where the defendant in AVO proceedings makes a complaint against the applicant. A cross application may
be made where both parties fear each other, and both are in need of protection. This may be appropriate where there is no power imbalance
between the parties, for example in the case of APVOs for violent neighbourhood disputes.
12.3 However, cross applications may be inappropriate where there is a power imbalance between the parties. For example, where a victim
of domestic violence takes out an AVO, the defendant may make a cross application to intimidate the victim. This can undermine the
beneficial effect the initial AVO may have had.
12.4 Cross applications may be taken out in circumstances where other dispute resolution strategies, such as mediation, would be more
appropriate. If the parties have equal bargaining power and the dispute is not violent, it may waste the court’s time to hear
applications followed by cross applications.
12.5 Police will not normally make a cross application on behalf of a person. However, the two parties may use different police stations
and different courts. In this situation, the police may end up applying on behalf of both parties where they are unaware of the other
person’s application.
How can the legislation prevent unwarranted cross applications?
Is there a way of keeping police and courts informed of cross applications?
MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS
12.6 There is no provision to stop people from making multiple applications. For example, where an application for an AVO has been
withdrawn or dismissed, the person seeking protection can initiate new proceedings either in the same or in a different court. There
may be legitimate reasons for reapplying after an application has been withdrawn. However, where the application has been dismissed
after a hearing and the circumstances have not altered, there will be no basis for reapplying.
12.7 It takes some time to defend a final order and have the application dismissed. An interim order can be made without notice having
been served on the defendant, and the defendant must comply with the order until the hearing. If the application is dismissed after
a hearing, the person seeking protection can immediately reapply in a different court. The defendant has no remedy against this.
Is there a way of keeping police and courts informed of multiple applications?
Should the right to reapply for an order be limited, for example where an application has already been dismissed and the circumstances
have not altered?
VARIATION AND REVOCATION
12.8 An AVO is an order of the court and so cannot be varied at will by the parties. It is important that the parties go to court
where there is a change of circumstances. Otherwise, conduct which both parties consent to may amount to a breach.
12.9 An applicant, a defendant or a police officer can apply to have an AVO varied or revoked.
A police officer can only apply if the initial complaint was made by a police officer. This means that the police cannot apply for
variation where the protected person initially applied on his or her own behalf. One issue for consideration is whether police should
be able to apply for variation or revocation regardless of who made the initial complaint.
12.10 The grounds for variation or revocation are not specific – a court may vary or revoke an order “if satisfied that
in all the circumstances it is proper to do so”.
The court can reject an application if it is satisfied there has been no change in circumstances and the application is in the nature
of an appeal. Only a police officer can apply for a variation or revocation where the protected person is under 16 years of age.
An AVO can be varied by extending or reducing its duration, or by changing, adding to or deleting the conditions in the order.
12.11 An order cannot be varied or revoked unless the defendant has been served with notice of the application.
However, the court can extend the duration of the order without notice being served on the defendant if:
(a) the applicant lodged the application no later than 21 days before the day on which the order is due to expire, and
(b) the application is listed for mention before the court no later than 14 days after the day the application was lodged, and
(c) notice of the application has not been served on the defendant by the time the matter is heard by the court.
12.12 Such an order ceases to have effect 21 days after it is made (unless revoked sooner), or on an earlier date specified in the
This section is very prescriptive. It would be simpler if the legislation provided that an application for extension can be made
before the order expires.
12.13 An applicant cannot apply to have an order extended if the order has already expired. Because an AVO aims to prevent apprehended
violence, it cannot act retrospectively. The proper remedy is to grant an interim order for the protected person’s safety until
the matter can be considered by the court.
12.14 Similarly, a defendant cannot apply to have an order revoked if it has already expired. This is significant, because the consequences
of revocation and expiration differ. Where an AVO expires, the defendant cannot hold a firearm licence for 10 years. This prohibition
does not apply where the AVO has been revoked.
12.15 It is important that the decision to vary or revoke an order reflects the best interests of all persons in need of protection.
For example, there is a danger that, following a reconciliation with a violent partner, an adult protected person will vary or revoke
the AVO, leaving the child without legal protection. The decision to vary or revoke the order stems from the adults’ decision
to be together, and may not be in the child’s best interests. There is also a danger that the defendant has put pressure on
the protected person to apply for a revocation.
12.16 If an AVO is made for the protection of more than one person, its variation or revocation can affect any one or more of them.
It is not necessary that all the persons on the order apply for variation or revocation. If one of the persons is a child, the court
must be satisfied that the child is no longer in need of the level of protection afforded by the order.
12.17 Under Part 15A, a defendant can apply for variation or revocation if the circumstances have changed. However, it may be more
efficient if only the person in need of protection can apply for variation or revocation, especially if the order was imposed on
the defendant after a hearing. Where the defendant consented to the order, it may be important to preserve the right to apply for
variation or revocation, as the defendant may not have fully understood the implications of the order when giving consent.
Are the provisions regarding variation and revocation of AVOs adequate? Why or why not?
Should police officers be allowed to apply for a variation regardless of who made the initial complaint?
Is it possible to safeguard against variation or revocation where the protected person has been threatened or coerced?
Should section 562F(8) be simplified, to provide that an application for extension can be made before the order expires?
Do the provisions dealing with variation and revocation provide adequate protection where more than one person is included on the
In what circumstances should defendants be able to apply to vary or revoke an AVO?
THE APPEALS PROCESS
12.18 If the order was made ex parte, the defendant may be able to apply to the local court for the case to be reviewed. The local
court will review the case if satisfied that the defendant did not know about the proceedings until they were completed, the defendant
was stopped from taking action because of accident, illness or misadventure or there are other good reasons why the application should
The defendant cannot apply to the local court for a revocation of the AVO unless the circumstances have changed.
In this way an application for revocation or variation cannot be in the nature of an appeal.
12.19 The defendant can appeal to the District Court against the making of an AVO. If the order was made by consent, the defendant
requires leave. A protected person, defendant or police officer can also apply to the District Court against an order varying or
revoking an AVO. If the local court or children’s court has dismissed an application for an AVO, the person seeking protection
or police officer can appeal to the District Court for an AVO. In either case the person has 28 days to lodge the appeal.
Appeals in the District Court are held by way of rehearing on the transcripts of evidence of the local court proceedings. The appellant
cannot call witnesses or give evidence unless the District Court is satisfied there are special or substantial reasons. The AVO remains
in force pending appeal.
Is the appeals process satisfactory? If not, how can it be improved?

13. Stalking and intimidation
History of this reference (Digest)
Incidence of stalking and intimidation
Elements of the offence
Harassment causing distress or detriment
13.1 Section 562AB of the
provides that it is an offence to stalk or intimidate another person:
A person who stalks or intimidates another person with the intention of causing the person to fear physical or mental harm is liable
to imprisonment for 5 years, or to a fine of 50 penalty units, or both.
13.2 Since the offence is contained in
, it is necessary for this review to determine whether these provisions remain appropriate for securing the policy objectives of the
Part. The policy objectives are to ensure the safety and protection of all people who experience violence, and to reduce and prevent
13.3 Stalking has only been recognised as a criminal offence relatively recently. All Australian jurisdictions enacted anti-stalking
legislation between 1993 and 1996,
and there is similar legislation in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada and New Zealand.
The widespread enactment of anti-stalking legislation aimed to fill a perceived gap in the law. Previously, people who were subjected
to persistent unwanted attention had no legal remedy if the behaviour in question was not in itself criminal.
13.4 The stalking and intimidation offence was inserted into the
It was introduced in the context of domestic violence, and originally only applied to people who were in a domestic relationship.
In 1994 this limitation was removed, recognising that stalking and intimidation can occur regardless of whether or not the parties
are in a domestic relationship.
In 1999, the offence was expanded again. Previously, the offender had to cause fear of “personal injury”, which failed
to recognise that stalking, as an expression of power and control, may not aim to arouse fear of physical violence.
As amended, it is an offence to cause fear of “physical or mental harm”.
13.5 Anti-stalking legislation is inherently difficult to draft.
The offence is by nature imprecise, as behaviour which is otherwise considered quite ordinary becomes threatening in context: “the
difficulty in defining stalking as a concept lies in its paradoxical status as an act that is ambiguously located somewhere between
crime and conformity”.
While stalking is qualitatively different from the legitimate pursuit of a love interest, it is difficult to clarify at what point
the behaviour warrants criminal sanction.
Because of this inherent imprecision, it is difficult to set clear parameters in the legislation.
13.6 There is significant overlap between AVOs and stalking and intimidation. The same conduct may give rise to an offence of stalking
and intimidation and also constitute grounds for an AVO. Both deal with action which may not be criminal in isolation but, in context,
could be serious enough to warrant legal intervention. A court can grant an AVO where the person seeking protection has reasonable
grounds to fear, and in fact fears, harassment, molestation, intimidation or stalking, sufficient to warrant the making of the order.
The AVO provides a means of stopping the offending behaviour, as it prohibits the defendant from stalking or engaging in conduct
that intimidates the protected person.
If a person is charged with stalking or intimidation, the court must make an interim AVO for the protection of the alleged victim.
A final order is made if the accused is found guilty.
The Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research has found that AVOs are very effective in preventing stalking.
INCIDENCE OF STALKING AND INTIMIDATION
13.7 Stalking and intimidation occurs at a reasonably high rate.
Perpetrators are more often men and victims are more often women. The parties may be intimates, former intimates, acquaintances or
strangers. In a majority of cases, the perpetrator is somebody known to the victim. Motives for offending vary – the offender
may wish to initiate or renew a relationship, or may wish to control or instil fear in the victim. While some stalkers may be psychotic
or delusional, most are not. Stalking and intimidation is clearly linked to domestic violence, as associated violence is more likely
to occur between intimates than between strangers or acquaintances. Intimates or former intimates are more likely to be threatened
or assaulted or have their property damaged, and also experience stalking-type behaviour of a longer duration and wider variety.
13.8 The number of convictions under section 562AB has steadily increased since the offence was introduced in 1993.
ELEMENTS OF THE OFFENCE
13.9 It is an offence to stalk or intimidate a person with the intention of causing fear of physical or mental harm. The offence includes
causing a person to fear harm to another person with whom he or she has a domestic relationship.
For example, conduct which causes a person to fear for the safety of his or her child is covered.
13.10 In deciding whether a person’s conduct amounts to intimidation, the court can have regard to any pattern of violence in
the person’s behaviour, especially violence constituting a domestic violence offence.
Relationship evidence is also admissible in order to determine whether the conduct in question was likely to cause fear. Such evidence
puts the conduct in question “into a true and realistic context, in order to assist the jury to appreciate the full significance
of what would otherwise appear to be an isolated act”.
Actus reus – what type of behaviour is covered?
13.11 The legislation outlines the types of behaviour which may constitute stalking or intimidation. “Stalking” is defined
the following of a person about or the watching or frequenting of the vicinity of or an approach to a person’s place of residence,
business or work or any place that a person frequents for the purposes of any social or leisure activity.
13.12 “Intimidation” is broader, and more open ended. It means:
(a) conduct amounting to harassment or molestation, or
(b) the making of repeated telephone calls, or
(c) any conduct that causes a reasonable apprehension of injury to a person or to a person with whom he or she has a domestic relationship,
or of violence or damage to any person or property.
13.13 Intimidation could therefore include keeping a person under surveillance, driving past a person’s house, interfering
with a person’s property or sending unwanted emails, letters, faxes, unsolicited gifts or offensive material. Cyberstalking
would also fall within the definition of intimidation.
Mens rea – the intention to cause fear of harm
13.14 The offender must intend to cause the other person to fear physical or mental harm. To prove the requisite intent, the prosecution
must satisfy the court beyond a reasonable doubt that the person knows the conduct is likely to cause fear in the other person. It
is not necessary to prove the victim actually feared physical or mental harm.
13.15 Some jurisdictions require proof of an intention to cause fear or apprehension.
This has proved to be a significant barrier to prosecution, and as a result there has been a shift towards more objective tests which
focus on whether offenders
should have known
that their behaviour would cause fear.
In NSW, there is no need to prove that the accused subjectively intended to cause fear, only that the accused knew that the behaviour
in question was
to cause fear.
13.16 One area of potential ambiguity is where the accused did not intend the victim to find out about the conduct in question, for
example where a stalker secretly keeps a victim under surveillance. Arguably, such activities may fall outside the scope of the offence,
if they are not “likely” to cause fear.
Another area of ambiguity is where the behaviour is directed at more than one person. For example, if a person regularly follows
different people about, and does not target the same victim more than once, does this constitute stalking?
13.17 The mental state of the accused is also significant.
Some stalkers suffer from psychiatric disabilities or mental illnesses, which may result in delusional episodes and reduce their
legal culpability.
Where the accused has a mental illness, criminal prosecution may be inappropriate. It is less clear cut where the accused has a personality
disorder, or emotional or behavioural problems. Indeed, many stalkers act irrationally, and demonstrate little understanding of the
effect of their behaviour. It is worth noting, however, that most offenders are not psychotic or delusional.
Defences and exclusions
13.18 Other jurisdictions exclude certain conduct from the scope of their legislation. For example, in Queensland, stalking does not
include acts done for a lawful purpose, acts done for the purpose of an industrial, political or other public dispute, reasonable
conduct engaged in for the person’s trade, business or occupation, or reasonable conduct to obtain or give information that
the person has a legitimate interest in obtaining or giving.
In Tasmania and Victoria, it is not an offence if the person is performing his or her official duties,
while in Western Australia, it is a defence that the accused acted with lawful authority or reasonable excuse.
This ensures that legitimate activity is not inadvertently brought within the scope of the offence. There are no statutory defences
or exclusions in NSW.
How effective are the stalking and intimidation provisions in
in protecting people against acts or threats of violence?
Is the requisite intent, that the behaviour in question be “likely to cause fear of physical or mental harm”, appropriate?
Should the legislation include any defences or exclusions?
HARASSMENT CAUSING DISTRESS OR DETRIMENT
13.19 The requirement that the offender cause “fear of physical or mental harm” creates an important threshold, ensuring
that behaviour which is merely irritating or annoying remains outside the scope of the offence.
13.20 However, persistent unwanted attention may have a significant impact on a person’s life, although no fear of harm is caused.
A recent Australian study reported that “a majority of victims (63%) modified their lifestyle in response to the stalking behaviours”,
concluding that “most victims report significant disruption to their daily functioning irrespective of exposure to associated
Victims took measures such as increasing their home security, changing their telephone number or screening their calls or, in more
serious cases, moving house or changing jobs. The unwanted attention also restricted their social activity and led to increased work
absenteeism. Arguably the statutory focus on causing “fear of physical or mental harm” does not recognise the effect
that stalking and intimidation have on the victim’s enjoyment of life.
13.21 For this reason, some jurisdictions include behaviour causing detriment or distress, as well as behaviour causing fear. For
example, under the Queensland model, unlawful stalking includes conduct that “causes detriment, reasonably arising in all the
circumstances, to the stalked person or another person.”
“Detriment” includes prevention or hindrance from doing an act a person is lawfully entitled to do, for example where
a person changes the route or form of transport he or she would ordinarily use to travel to work. It also includes compulsion to
do an act a person is lawfully entitled to abstain from doing, for example where a person feels compelled to sell a property he or
she would otherwise not sell.
13.22 However, it is important that the threshold is not too low, otherwise behaviour which is merely irritating may be criminalised
inadvertently. Indeed, legislation in some jurisdictions has been criticised for being too broad or too uncertain. The Victorian
legislation is reportedly being used to deal with neighbourhood disputes, noise complaints, road rage and disputes between school
children, prompting concern that “the definition of stalking is increasingly being widened through dealing with situations
that originally may have been outside the scope of the current legislation”.
The United Kingdom model has also been criticised for its breadth and uncertainty. Although it was enacted to address stalking-type
behaviour, it prohibits any “course of conduct which amounts to harassment of another”.
The summary offence of harassment includes causing alarm or distress, and does not require the victim to have been put in fear.
This captures a much wider range of behaviour than the Australian legislation, and is reportedly being used far more widely than
was intended, for a variety of behaviour including low level harassment and neighbourhood disputes relating to property or money.
Should the offence of stalking or intimidation cover behaviour causing detriment or distress, or should it remain limited to behaviour
causing fear?
Does the legislation draw an appropriate line between nuisance behaviour, which is annoying but lawful, and criminal conduct?

state, and a Model Anti-Stalking Code has been developed by the National Institute of Justice: see United States of America,

(Australian Institute of Criminology, No 166, 2000); A Davidson, “Stalking in Cyberspace”
(2000) 20(3)
For example, the South Australian model requires the prosecution to prove that the accused stalked the victim with intent to cause
serious physical or mental harm, or serious apprehension or fear:
Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935
The Model Criminal Code Committee recommended that proof of an intention to cause serious fear or apprehension be retained, so that
people who caused fear without intending to could not be prosecuted: Commonwealth of Australia,
Model Criminal Code Chapter 5 Non Fatal Offences Against the Person
(Model Criminal Code Officers Committee, Report, 1998) at 61.
The Western Australian legislation was amended for this reason: “The stalking provisions need to be extended to cover those
situations where there is no intent on the part of the accused but the victim nevertheless fears for his or her safety or is prevented
from going about his or her normal lifestyle. Therefore, the [
Criminal Law Amendment Bill 1997
] provides for a new simple offence of stalking which does not involve any intent on the part of the accused.” Western Australia,
Parliamentary Debates (Hansard)
Legislative Council, 11 November 1997 at 7465. There are now two separate offences – the more serious offence requires the accused
to have behaved “with intent to intimidate”; the lesser offence only that accused’s behaviour be “reasonably
expected to intimidate”:
Criminal Code Compliance Act 1913
(WA) s 338E(1) and s 338E(2).
For this reason, the Queensland legislation explicitly provides that it is immaterial whether the victim was aware of being stalked,
or whether the accused intended to cause the fear or apprehension:
Criminal Code Act 1899
(Qld) s 359C.

on grounds of the mental health of the accused: information supplied by the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (3 September
2002). See also United States of America,
