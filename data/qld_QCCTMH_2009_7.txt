REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
Szabo (“the applicant”) seeks orders against Max Miller (“the
respondent”) her neighbour in the residential
park located at 530 Pine
Ridge Road, Coombabah. The applicant is seeking orders that the respondent
remove concrete from her property
and that he be restrained from trespassing on
her property and that he cease all forms of harassment.
applicant and the respondent are home owners as defined in the
Manufactured
(the “MHRP Act”) and their
respective homes are situated adjacent to each other on sites 90 & 90B
respectively, 530
Pine Ridge Road, Settlers Village Park, Coombabah (“the
27 May 2008 the applicant forwarded a letter to the park manager making
complaints about the respondent. The letter alleged that;
had been disrupting and interfering with the natural flow of water and had
carried out concreting on her property without
permission. It was also alleged
that her garden hose holder had disappeared, the brick tiles from underneath her
house had been taken
away, grass at the side of her shed had been damaged, her
car had been tampered with, the tiles were covered with black foamy dirt
black ants, and finally she had been subject to excessive and deliberate noise,
scare tactics, lizards and frogs.
25 June 2008 the applicant filed an application in the Tribunal. The statement
of claim asserts :
Miller interfered with the natural flow of water:
(i) illegally;
(ii) concreting
without my permission; and
(iii) dishonestly
while I was on holidays.
Miller had no right to be on my property, I consider it trespassing.
Miller deliberately making excessive noise, using scare tactics i.e. lizards,
frogs and large black ants. He interferes with
the peaceful enjoyment of my
Miller still pours cement little by little, mixed in a plastic jug, and then
covers it with gravel. He also does further digging,
scraping ditches so that
the water goes under my house, damaging my garden tiles, determined to cause
damage to my property.
Miller covered up his gutter with bricks, tiles and cement, diverting the
natural flow of water unnecessarily, so that he can
have a backyard patio. He
had achieved that at my expense. Previous owners of my property would not have
allowed him to do that.
applicant seeks orders that:
(a) all the
concreting be removed and the grass and everything be restored the way it was
Miller be stopped from trespassing on my property;
Miller must cease all forms of harassment immediately; and
expense that occurs in restoring the property to the way it was previously be
paid by Max Miller.
respondent in his defence says that:
“I Max Miller did not
interfere with the natural flow of water, I cemented three feet by three inches
wide along the retaining
wall fence on Irene’s side so the water would run
down the fence, into the gutter and onto the side of the road.
No grass was removed from where the cement was put because all grass along
the fence is poisoned by village gardeners.
Fencing was not touched, it is still the same now as it was when the
previous manager was here.
I have not been any further then the fence on Irene’s property. As
for digging, scraping ditches so that the water goes under
Irene’s house
and damaging her tiles is ridiculous. Her property is about three feet above
our property.
For as long as we have lived here (14 years) we have had pavers and bricks
in our backyard, I just covered them with render to make
it look better.
I do no make excessive noise or use scare tactics against this woman. As
for making noises like lizards, frogs and black ants this
Legislation
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act 2003
Act”) provides :
8 Jurisdiction of tribunal
(1) The tribunal has jurisdiction to deal with the matters it is empowered to
deal with under this Act or an empowering Act.
(2) In exercising its jurisdiction, the tribunal is not subject to direction
or control, other than as provided under this Act.”
Dictionary in Section 2 of the CCT Act defines empowering Act to include the
140 of the MHRP Act provides:
140 Site agreement dispute
If there is a site agreement dispute, either party to the dispute may
apply to the tribunal for an order, and the tribunal may make
any order it
considers appropriate, to resolve the dispute.
Submissions and findings
Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine matters it is empowered to deal
with under the CCT Act or the MHRP Act. The jurisdiction
of the Tribunal with
respect to manufactured homes is limited to the sections in the MHRP Act that
confers jurisdiction on the Tribunal.
The MHRP Act expressly confers on the
Tribunal jurisdiction to; make orders about a proposed variation of a special
term of a site
agreement (section 22): order compensation when a site agreement
is terminated (section 35); order a site agreement be terminated
(section 38):
make a compensation order when an agreement is terminated (section 40): order
the park owner consent to the assignment
of a site agreement (section 50): make
an abandonment or a sale order (section 52(6)): make an order about a site rent
increase (sections
70, 71(7)) and make orders about a site agreement dispute
(section 140).
application by the applicant against the respondent is not with respect to a
site agreement dispute and does not fall within the
ambit of any of the sections
in the MHRP Act that confer jurisdiction on the Tribunal. I have examined all
the provisions of the
MHRP Act and consider that the Tribunal does not have
against another.
The Tribunal does not have equitable jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief or
to provide relief to restrain activities of the type
alleged by the applicant
against the respondent.
am satisfied that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine
this matter.
application is dismissed.
