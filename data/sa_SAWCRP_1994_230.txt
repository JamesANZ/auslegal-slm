Determination No. 94-0230
Workers’ Compensation
ETTRIDGE AND THE STATE TRANSPORT
(00247717/01/05 and
00247717/01/06)
Determination of Review Officer made on 13 April,
(Hearings 24 February, 1994 and 13 April, 1994)
Review Officer Bowering
This is the determination of applications lodged on 5 January, 1994 by
John Patrick Ettridge as worker under a contract of service
with the State
Transport Authority as employer which seek reviews pursuant to the Workers
Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, 1986
("the Act") of a decision made by the
employer on 21 December, 1993 to vary the worker's weekly payments of
compensation (No. 1 Application)
and of a decision made "1988 - to date"
regarding "the method used to assess worker's average weekly earnings" (No. 2
Application).
The worker appeared in person and the employer, which I
find to be an exempt employer within the meaning of the Act, was represented
Ms Judy Hughes of counsel of Crown Solicitor's Office with Mr Alan Wingrave,
Risk and Injury Manager with the employer. Mr Noel
Southam attended with the
worker as an observer.
At the hearings and in correspondence directed to
me (and to the exempt employer) before and between the hearings, it was apparent
the worker wished to dispute the basis of the calculation of his notional weekly
earnings on which his weekly income maintenance
("make up pay") was based
to the giving of the variation notice by the exempt employer dated
21 December, 1993. Both applications for review sought to litigate
the original
fixing of the notional weekly earnings amount and that is not an issue raised by
the reviewable decision (see
Wiechmann v Lovering
167 LSJS 465
(1992) 59 SASR 203).
The original fixing of the notional
weekly earnings for this worker has already been the subject of considerable
litigation and the
quantification finally determined long before the giving of
the notice dated 21 December, 1993. At the hearings, the worker sought
introduce in evidence aspects of the notional weekly earnings not previously
specifically considered by any Review Officer, Tribunal
or the Supreme Court.
However, in
Pivovaroff v WorkCover
(1993) 5 WCATR 199
[1993] SAWCAT 39
, the Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal held:
"That determination .... in respect to the quantification of the worker's
average weekly earnings .... must be taken to have included
all matters which
could rightfully have been brought into account to make that assessment whether
they were then asserted or not."
I have taken into consideration the
determination made by Review Officer Mostowyj in
Ettridge and State
Transport Authority South Australia
(1990) 3 WRO Determination
[1990] SAWCRP 157
, the reasons for decision published by the Workers
Compensation Appeal Tribunal in
State Transport Authority v
(1990) 2 WCATR 264
, the judgment of the Full Court of
the Supreme Court in
Ettridge v STA and WorkCover
163 LSJS 153.
The fixing of the notional weekly earnings cannot be
re-litigated before me on the basis of the applications for review before me:
Liccione v WorkCover
unreported, judgment S.4368 of
Matheson J published on 21 January, 1994;
[1994] SASC 4368.
I have also
noted the determinations given by Review Officer Lieschke in
Ettridge and
the State Transport Authority
(1993) 6 WRO Determination 93-0050;
[1993] SAWCRP 50 and by Review Officer Russell in
Ettridge and the State
Transport Authority
(1993) 6 WCRP Determination 93-0563; [1993]
SAWCRP 563. I indicate I am happy to adopt the reasoning given by Review
Officer Russell
in the later determination in relation to disbursement costs
reasonably incurred by the worker in the conduct of the matters before
Just prior to the second hearing day, Ms Hughes forwarded to
me by facsimile a copy of a letter dated 9 April, 1994 sent to the worker
relation to the applications for review which indicated the employer had
withdrawn its determination dated 21 December, 1993.
At the hearing, I brought
to the attention of the parties the Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal
decision in
WorkCover v Lombardi
unreported, print
(1994) 6 WCATR 34
[1994] SAWCAT 20
, which held that an exempt
employer was not able to withdraw a decision once made, but given the statutory
function of the Review
Officer, required the Review Officer to make a fresh
determination of the decision the subject of review.
Notwithstanding
apparent understanding and agreement signalled by the worker that my
re-assessing the notional weekly
earnings already fixed, the only documentation and submissions he wished to put
before me was in
relation to this aspect.
Given the attitude and
concessions of the exempt employer, I determined to make a fresh determination
of the matter subject to review
thus disposing of both applications for review
DETERMINATION:
Pursuant to Section 96 of
the Act, I determine to set aside the determination of the exempt employer made
on 21 December, 1993 and
decide in substitution for that decision that the
worker is entitled to ongoing weekly payments of income maintenance assessed on
the basis of notional weekly earnings in the sum of $721.28 until lawfully
suspended, discontinued or varied in accordance with the
appeared personally and is not entitled to costs of representation but is
entitled to disbursement costs reasonably incurred.
Any appeal against
this determination must be lodged with the Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal
within one month of the receipt
of this determination. Enquiries about appeals
may be directed to the Registrar of the Tribunal, 8th Floor, Riverside Centre,
Terrace, Adelaide, (phone: 207.0999) and forms for appeal are available
from the same address.
