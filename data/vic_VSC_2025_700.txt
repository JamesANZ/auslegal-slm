HIS HONOUR:
Introduction
1 These reasons address an application
that Ms Beverley Gladys Hunter (
), the wife of the
third defendant, Mr Bailey Gordon Hunter (
), be appointed
as his litigation guardian pursuant to rule 15.03 of the
Supreme Court
(General Civil Procedure) Rules 2025
Application
2 The Guardian Application was
foreshadowed with the Court and the plaintiff in advance of and during a
directions hearing held on
17 October 2025. Directions were then made for
the filing and service of further material in support, including the (then
anticipated)
receipt of a medical report from a treating geriatrician, and an
outline of submissions.
3 The Guardian Application
was heard on 7 November 2025, and was not opposed by the plaintiff. For the
reasons that follow, I made
an order at the conclusion of the hearing that
Ms Hunter be appointed as litigation guardian for Mr Hunter in respect
of this proceeding.
Materials relied upon
4 In support of the Guardian Application,
the following material was relied on:
(a) the affidavit of Ms
Catherine Pulverman sworn 10 October 2025 (
First Affidavit
(b) the supplementary affidavit of Ms Pulverman
sworn 31 October 2025 (
Second Affidavit
(c) the defendants’ written submissions filed

included an expert report of Dr Timothy Bayles, the treating geriatrician
for Mr Hunter (

principles for determining whether a person is a ‘person under
disability’ pursuant
to rule 15.01(1) of the

the observations of Derham AsJ in
Vishniakov v
The Written Submissions
also outlined the circumstances where a person is not competent to give evidence
Evidence Act 2008
7 It was submitted that, in circumstances where
a litigation guardian is required to be appointed, consideration is to be given
the existence of a diagnosed cognitive impairment and the consequence that
the third defendant, by virtue of the diagnosis, is incapable
of competently
managing his affairs in relation to the current proceeding, particularly insofar
as providing instructions and giving
evidence is
was further submitted that the Capacity Report confirmed that Mr Hunter is
not capable of managing his affairs and providing
the necessary instructions in
order to conduct the proceeding, both as a defendant personally, and as a
director of Kanyon Pty Ltd
and Wickley Nominees Pty Ltd, being the sixth and
fifth defendants respectively. On that basis it was submitted that a litigation
guardian should be appointed for Mr Hunter in respect of this proceeding.
9 In short, Ms Hunter was submitted to be a
person appropriate to be appointed because she: is not a person under
disability; has
no interest in the proceeding adverse to Mr Hunter; has
consented to being appointed; is in good health; is familiar with and
understands
the proceeding; is and will continue to be in a position to act in
Mr Hunter’s interests; and will be able to give instructions
when required.
10 During oral exchanges with the
Bench at the hearing on 7 November 2025, Ms Pulverman again submitted
that the relevant requirements
were satisfied and the appointment should be
made. Ms Pulverman also helpfully indicated that if there was a need to
provide any
further evidence, that could be done, including obtaining a further
report from Dr Bayles if necessary.
plaintiff, Mr Sinisgalli informed the Court that he considered it appropriate
that the appointment be made and that the
plaintiff did not oppose the
application.
Order 15 of the Rules and principles and
observations regarding the appointment of litigation guardians
12 Order 15 of the Rules deals with, among
other things, the appointment of a litigation guardian for a person under
disability. Relevantly,
order 15 of the Rules provides in part as
15.01 Definition
In this Order,
person under disability
(a) a minor; or
(b) a person who is incapable, by reason of injury, disease, senility, illness
or physical or mental infirmity, of managing that
person's affairs in relation
to the proceeding.
15.02 Litigation guardian of person under disability
(1) Except where otherwise provided by or under any Act, a person under
disability shall commence or defend a proceeding by the person's
(2) Except where otherwise provided by these Rules, anything in a proceeding
that is required or permitted by the Rules to be done
by a party shall or may,
if the party is a person under disability, be done by the person's litigation
(3) A litigation guardian of a person under disability shall act by a
(4) Unless for special reason the Court otherwise orders, the litigation
guardian of a person under disability is not personally
liable for costs awarded
against the person.
15.03 Appointment of litigation guardian
(1) A person may be a litigation guardian of a person under disability if
the first-mentioned person—
(a) is not a person under disability; and
(b) has no interest in the proceeding adverse to that of the person under
disability.
(2) Where a person is authorised by or under any Act to conduct legal
proceedings in the name of or on behalf of a person under disability
referred to
in paragraph (b) of the definition of that term in Rule 15.01, the person so
authorised, unless the Court otherwise orders,
shall be entitled to be
litigation guardian of the person under disability in any proceeding to which
that person's authority extends.
(3) Where after a proceeding is commenced a party to the proceeding becomes a
person under disability, the Court shall appoint a litigation
guardian of that
(4) Where the interests of a party who is a person under disability so
require, the Court may—
(a) appoint or remove a litigation guardian; or
(b) substitute another person as litigation guardian.

be affected by, the
application.

Australia and the United Kingdom:
(a) There is a presumption
that everybody of full age has the mental capacity to manage their own affairs,
including the commencement

proving to the contrary rests with those asserting
incapacity.

(e) A solicitor who persists with representing a

on an indemnity basis even if there is no

because they focus on the person's ability to bring
or defend a particular

transaction.
(l) The question of incapacity in relation to

relevant legal proceeding;
(ii) whether the person
had the ability to communicate this requirement to someone who could arrange an
appropriate advisor or, alternatively,
whether he or she could arrange such an
advisor of their own accord;
(iii) whether the
person had the ability to instruct the advisor with sufficient clarity to enable
that advisor to understand the

Vishniakov v Lay
the authorities cited there by Derham AsJ. While, as noted by
Derham AsJ in that case at [30(i)], the appointment of a litigation
guardian is a serious matter because it may deprive a person of their rights
under the common law to sue or defend a proceeding in
their own name, it is also
relevant to consider, in an urgent case such as this, what will best serve the
administration of justice.
There is a risk that the processes of the Court and
any prospective judgment may be frustrated if the current application cannot
made, which would be the case if no litigation guardian can be appointed.
Consideration and disposition
15 Having regard to the terms of order 15
of the Rules, the evidence before the Court, the nature of the proceedings and
arising in it, and the relevant principles and observations referred
to above, it is appropriate that Ms Hunter be appointed as
Hunter’s litigation guardian in respect of this proceeding. My
reasons for so concluding can be briefly stated.
there is evidence before me that
establishes that Mr Hunter is incapable by reason of disease, senility,
illness or physical or mental
infirmity of managing his affairs in relation to
this proceeding. I refer in this regard to the Capacity Report.
17 Among other things, the Capacity Report recorded
the following:
the past year, Mr Hunter has had ongoing deterioration of his cognitive and
functional abilities related to his underlying dementia.
assessed Mr Hunter for cognition and capacity on 23 September 2025
where he demonstrated significant difficulty with retention
and retrieval of
information, along with communication. Dr Bayles had performed a
standardised Mini Mental State Examination, for
which Mr Hunter scored
7/30. Dr Bayles expressed the opinion that this indicated severe, advanced
cognitive impairment consistent
with Mr Hunter’s progressive mixed
dementia. Dr Bayles noted that Mr Hunter was not oriented to time or
place, and that he
was unable to recall the specific names of the companies or
positions he held in the past.
opinion that, due to Mr Hunter’s dementia and cognitive impairment,
he met the definition of a ‘handicapped
person’ and lacks capacity
to reasonably understand and respond to the proceeding. Dr Bayles also
opined that Mr Hunter is
not competent to give evidence by reason of
satisfying the requirements under
section 13(1)
(Vic). In this context, it was noted that
Mr Hunter’s permanent and progressive cognitive impairment restricts
his ability to
not only understand and retain information from questioning, but
also his ability to communicate a coherent response.
the assessment performed, Dr Bayles believes that Mr Hunter does not
have the mental and physical capacity to exercise his powers
and duties as a
director of Wickley Nominees Pty Ltd, as the trustee of the
and as a director of
Kanyon Pty Ltd.
18 It is apparent from the Capacity
Report and the above that Dr Bayles referred to the defined term
‘handicapped person’
rather than a ‘person under
disability’. This was because it was the term used in his letter of
instructions, which resulted
from a small error of the solicitors using a
previous definition from a former iteration of the Rules. Importantly however,
of instructions set out a definition of ‘handicapped
person’ that was in identical terms to the definition of a ‘person
under disability’ in rule 15.01 of the Rules, relevantly being ‘...a
person who is incapable, by reason of injury, disease,
senility, illness or
physical or mental infirmity, of managing the person’s affairs in relation
to the proceeding’. It
is apparent from the terms of the Capacity Report
that Dr Bayles directed his consideration towards this definition, being
the relevant
and applicable definition under rule 15.01 of the Rules.
Consequently, this small difference in terminology is of no relevant consequence
for present purposes, noting also that the Court was informed that a further
report correcting the error could be obtained if
19 Regarding Mr Hunter’s capacity, I
also refer to the evidence outlined in the First Affidavit regarding
instructions received
by Ms Pulverman, on and from May 2025, about
Mr Hunter’s advanced state of dementia, and his residing in an aged
care nursing
rule 15.03(3) of the Rules is engaged because, subsequent to the
commencement of this proceeding, a party to it, namely Mr Hunter,
become a person under disability. As earlier set out, this rule then provides
that the Court shall appoint a litigation guardian
I am satisfied on the
evidence before me that Ms Hunter is eligible to be appointed as the
litigation guardian for Mr Hunter. Having
regard to the terms of
rule 15.03(1) of the Rules, she is not a person under disability and she
has no interest in the proceeding
adverse to Mr Hunter. In this context, I
refer to the following evidence in the First Affidavit and the Second
Ms Pulverman
was informed by Ms Hunter and believes that Ms Hunter: is familiar
with the claim in the proceeding in general terms;
understands the risks to
Mr Hunter in the proceeding in respect of compensation being sought by the
plaintiff; has been updated by
the first defendant on the progress of the
proceeding; understands that she will need to provide instructions on a range of
engagement of experts, further security, preparation for trial, and
settlement matters; and will do whatever is necessary to assist
proceeding.
upon what she has observed and been informed by Ms Hunter,
Ms Pulverman believes that Ms Hunter is in very good health and is
still working.
22 For the avoidance of doubt, the
circumstances I have taken into account include Ms Hunter’s age and
being of advanced years,
noting, of course, that being of advanced years is not
an adverse factor in and of itself. I also note Ms Pulverman’s
that she has satisfied herself that Ms Hunter can and will act in
the best interests of Mr Hunter in this
proceeding.
, Ms Hunter has
confirmed in writing that she consents to being appointed as
Mr Hunter’s litigation guardian in this proceeding
and that she has
no interest in this proceeding that is adverse to the interests of
, there is evidence
that there is not currently an alternate person nominated who could be appointed
as a litigation guardian in the
event that Ms Hunter was not available,
which the evidence suggests is partly as a result of there being parties in the
whose interests may diverge from Mr Hunter’s, or who may
be called as witnesses at trial.
the issues in the proceeding are not without some complexity and
Ms Pulverman has deposed that Ms Hunter is aware of the issues,
familiarity with the claim and the proceeding, and is aware of the range of
issues upon which instructions will need to be provided.
, and as is always the case in
applications of this kind, if for some currently unanticipated future reason
Mr Hunter’s interests
required his litigation guardian to be replaced
or removed, the Court has ample power to do so, including pursuant to
rule 15.03(4)
of the Rules. For completeness, I add that this observation
is not intended to, and does not, convey any implicit or other reservation
regarding the suitability of the appointment of Ms Hunter as litigation
guardian for Mr Hunter.
considering and exercising the Court’s power under order 15 of the
Rules, I have sought to give effect to the overarching
Civil Procedure Act
required by
of that Act, and in so doing I have had regard to the
relevant objects in
In the circumstances, it is my view that
appointing Ms Hunter as litigation guardian for her husband,
Mr Hunter, serves well the
overarching purpose referred to.
Conclusion and orders
28 For the reasons stated above,
Ms Hunter will be appointed as litigation guardian for the third defendant,
