The Critical Role of Preparing Timely Written Reasons in
Decision-Making: Enhancing Rationality, Objectivity, and Legal Accuracy
This article examines the critical role of providing written reasons in
administrative decision-making, focusing on how transparency,
accountability,
and fairness are upheld through this practice. It explores the implications of
delayed written reasons, particularly
in high-stakes cases such as migration and
visa cancellations, where timely decisions are essential for justice.
Through an analysis of key cases, including Plaintiff M1/2021 and Verrill,
the article underscores the necessity of thorough reasoning
in both urgent and
routine matters. It argues that while timeliness is vital, it must be balanced
with intellectual rigour and detailed
reasoning to avoid perceptions of
injustice, safeguard public confidence, and ensure procedural fairness. The
piece concludes by
highlighting the need for administrative bodies to be
supported with adequate resources to deliver well-reasoned decisions that are
both timely and legally sound.
I Introduction
The provision of written reasons in administrative decision-making is a
fundamental aspect of ensuring transparency, accountability
and fairness within
legal frameworks. When decision-makers articulate the reasoning behind their
conclusions, they provide a safeguard
against arbitrariness, compel a thorough
examination of legal and factual issues and allow affected parties to understand
and scrutinise
the basis for the decision. This process not only benefits the
individuals involved by enabling potential appeals and judicial or
administrative reviews but also serves the broader legal system by contributing
to the consistency and development of legal standards.
However, the timely delivery of written reasons is equally critical. Delays
in providing reasons can lead to uncertainty, hinder the
ability of affected
parties to take appropriate legal action and erode public confidence in the
decision-making process. While certain
urgent cases may necessitate swift
decisions without immediate written explanations, it is imperative that such
decisions remain
grounded in careful, documented reasoning to maintain
intellectual rigour and accountability.

the need for timely, well-reasoned decisions to uphold the integrity of the
justice system, especially in high-stakes
contexts like visa cancellations and
migration matters. Ultimately, the article argues that written reasons are not
only a procedural
necessity but a cornerstone of justice.

III The Implications of Delayed Written Reasons
There are seven implications to consider.
Challenges of Urgent Decision-making
In urgent decision-making, time constraints may prevent the immediate
preparation of written reasons, particularly in emergency scenarios
where quick
decisions are necessary. Even when written reasons are delayed, decision-makers
must ensure that their decisions are
grounded in a thorough evaluation of the
legal and factual issues. Swift decisions do not excuse a lack of rigour;
decision-makers
must still engage in a comprehensive intellectual process to
ensure the decision remains sound.
Role of Intellectual Rigour
Even when written reasons are deferred, the decision-making process must
remain deliberate and methodical. The absence of written
reasons at the time of
a decision does not diminish the need for careful consideration.
Decision-makers should document key legal and factual points to ensure that,
when reasons are later formalised, they reflect the rational
process underlying
the decision.
Importance of Timely Written Reasons
While it may not always be possible to provide immediate written reasons,
doing so enhances transparency and clarity for all parties
involved. Written
reasons, when timely, enable the decision to be understood and scrutinised,
offering confidence to stakeholders
that the decision was fair and
well-founded.
Idea of Maintaining Accountability Despite Delays
Delayed written reasons can challenge accountability by leaving parties
uncertain about the reasoning behind a
accountability can still be preserved by ensuring that even in urgent cases, the
decision-making process is well-documented
and adheres to principles of fairness
and legality. When written reasons are eventually provided, they should
accurately capture
the reasoning applied at the time.
Addressing Perceptions of Injustice
When written reasons are delayed, parties may perceive the decision as
arbitrary or feel their arguments were overlooked. This perception
can undermine
confidence in the process. Clear communication regarding the reasons for delays
and the eventual provision of comprehensive
written explanations helps mitigate
these risks and preserves the integrity of the process.
Practical implications of delay
Delays in written reasons can create practical challenges for parties unsure
of how to proceed with compliance or appeal. To address
this, decision-makers
should ensure timely communication of any delay and provide a clear timeframe
within which written reasons
will be available. This transparency helps reduce
uncertainty and maintains trust in the process.
Ensuring Fairness in Urgent Decisions
Even in time-sensitive contexts, the decision-maker must still adhere to
principles of fairness and rigour. The absence of immediate
written reasons
should not detract from the fact that the decision was made with due care.
Later-provided written reasons must reflect
the thoroughness and rational basis
of the decision, ensuring fairness and accountability even under urgent
circumstances.
Plaintiff M1/2021
Plaintiff M1/2021
the High Court of Australia addressed critical issues surrounding visa
cancellation and non-refoulement obligations under the
Migration Act 1958
(Cth), highlighting the importance of ensuring fairness in urgent decisions. The
plaintiff, a South Sudanese citizen who arrived
in Australia in 2006 on a
Refugee and Humanitarian visa, faced visa cancellation under
criminal conviction for unlawful
Recognising the urgency of his situation, the plaintiff sought revocation of
this decision, expressing a well-founded fear of persecution,

background.
The crux of the case revolved around the plaintiff’s assertion that
returning him would breach Australia’s international
non-refoulement
obligations – principles designed to prevent individuals being sent back
to places where they face serious
The delegate of the
Minister for Home Affairs refused to revoke the cancellation, reasoning that
non-refoulement considerations could
be addressed in a future protection visa
application.
The plaintiff
challenged this, arguing that the delegate failed to give proper and timely
consideration to the immediate risks he
would face, thereby undermining the
fairness of the urgent decision at
The High Court held that while the delegate was required to read, understand,
and evaluate the plaintiff’s representations –
including those
concerning potential non-refoulement obligations – these obligations, not
yet enacted into domestic law, were
not mandatory relevant considerations at
this stage.
The Court found that deferring the assessment of non-refoulement obligations
to the protection visa process was permissible within
the statutory framework of

addressed in the visa cancellation review but

By allowing the delegate to delay evaluating the plaintiff’s
non-refoulement claims, the Court effectively diminishes the immediate
protection that such obligations are meant to provide. The
plaintiff’s
fears were neither abstract nor speculative; they involved concrete threats of
persecution and severe harm.
Deferring consideration of these serious risks overlooks the essential purpose
of non-refoulement principles – to offer prompt
protection before harm
occurs, not after prolonged procedural delays.
Moreover, the Court’s approach potentially undermines the fairness owed
to individuals in urgent circumstances. Non-refoulement
is a fundamental
principle of international human rights law, intended to shield vulnerable
individuals from imminent
By shifting the responsibility to a future protection visa application, the
decision subjects individuals like the plaintiff to extended
uncertainty and possible detention, without immediate recourse to the
protections they urgently require. The ruling also
highlights systemic issues in
the migration process by separating the assessment of non-refoulement
obligations from the initial
cancellation decision. This bifurcation can lead to
inefficiencies and a lack of holistic consideration of an individual’s
urgent circumstances, contrary to the principles of fairness that should guide
administrative decisions. The Court’s justification
– that these
matters can be addressed later – fails to acknowledge the immediate risks
and the importance of timely,
fair consideration of all relevant factors in
urgent decisions.

V Character Cases Before the Tribunal
A troubling pattern emerged before the AAT, replaced by the Administrative
Review Tribunal (the ‘ART’) from 14 October
2024, where
decision-makers were increasingly publishing their decisions but delaying
publication of their statements of reasons
for several

significant concerns regarding the transparency, accountability, and fairness of
the decision-making process

cases where the stakes are high, such as
those involving character assessments.

this issue is essential to maintaining the
integrity of the process and ensuring that the ART serves as a reliable and just

confidence in its processes.

enable determination of whether a decision

A decision-maker’s views can change during the course of preparing
written reasons, both in relation to the outcome and the
reasons for that
outcome. For this reason, whilst it is not always possible to provide written
reasons at the time of making a decision,
particularly in circumstances of
urgency, it is generally preferable to do so provided they can be adequately
expressed given the
relevant time
constraint.
Justice Thawley’s reasoning in the context of a delayed statement of
reasons for decision by the Tribunal offers several important
The Essential Role of Written Reasons
. It emphasises that written
reasons are crucial for determining whether a decision is affected by legal
error. Without these reasons,
it becomes challenging, if not impossible, to
meaningfully assess the validity of the decision and to consider the potential
for a judicial review. This underscores the importance of timely and
thorough documentation of a decision-maker’s rationale.
Promotion of Rational and Considered Decision-Making
. The process
of preparing written reasons is not merely a formality; it actively contributes
to the decision-making process itself.
Writing out reasons helps ensure that the
decision-maker has carefully identified and evaluated the relevant legal and
factual issues,
weighed the evidence appropriately, and considered the logic and
merit of their initial views. This process is vital for reaching
the correct or
preferable outcome, especially when multiple outcomes are possible.
The Broader Interests of the Administration of Justice
Migration Act
allows the Federal Court to extend the period for
filing an application for judicial review, but only if it is necessary in the
of the administration of justice. The judge’s’ reasoning
highlights that this power is broad and must be exercised with
the overall
fairness and integrity of the justice system in mind, rather than just the
interests of the individual applicant. Factors
such as the delay, reasons for
the delay and the potential merits of the case are all crucial in this
assessment.
Intellectual Rigour in Decision-Making
. As Justice Thawley notes,
even in urgent situations where written reasons cannot be immediately provided,
the decision must still
be the result of a thorough intellectual process. This
involves a careful review of the case, understanding and evaluating the
representations
made, and ensuring that the decision aligns with the statutory
requirements. This principle ensures that decisions are not rushed
superficially, thereby maintaining the integrity of the decision-making
Impact of Delayed Reasons on Legal Advice and Judicial Review
delay in providing written reasons can significantly affect the ability of an
applicant to seek legal advice and pursue judicial
review. In this case, the
applicant’s inability to provide reasons to his lawyer hindered the
lawyer’s capacity to assess
the prospects of success and to comply with
the certification requirement under
of the Act. This highlights the
practical implications of delayed reasons and the importance of timely
communication in the legal
Necessity of Extending Time in the Interests of Justice
. The court
must be satisfied that extending time to file for judicial review is necessary
in the interests of justice. In this case,
the merits of the underlying
application and the practical difficulties faced by the unrepresented applicant
were significant factors
in granting the extension. This demonstrates the
court’s role in ensuring that justice is served, even when procedural
are not met due to delays beyond the applicant’s control.
Judicial Discretion and Fairness
. The reasoning also illustrates
the importance of judicial discretion in ensuring fairness in the legal process.
By considering the
broader interests of justice, including the delay in
providing reasons and the applicant’s efforts to seek legal advice, the
court can balance procedural rules with the need to ensure a just outcome.
In summary, Justice Thawley’s reasoning teaches that the provision of
timely and thorough written reasons is fundamental to
the administration of
justice. It not only ensures transparency and accountability but also
facilitates a fair and considered decision-making
process. The court’s
ability to extend time for judicial review in appropriate cases reflects the
necessity of maintaining
these principles, even when procedural challenges
Although other legislative regimes impose time limits on administrative
decision-makers to make a
Migration Act
imposes what can only be described as a guillotine provision; if a
decision is not made within the prescribed period, the decision

deemed to be affirmed. This can have significant consequences for individuals
seeking administrative review of migration
Imposing time limits for an administrative decision-maker to make a decision
presents several challenges. The time constraint may
place undue pressure on
decision-makers, particularly in complex cases that require thorough
consideration of evidence, legal issues,
or policy implications. A rigid
deadline could result in rushed decisions, increasing the risk of errors,
procedural fairness concerns
or inadequate reasoning, which could lead to
appeals or judicial or administrative review. The goal of ensuring timely
must be balanced with the need for quality and just outcomes, and a
short time frame may undermine this balance.
Such a strict limit may not account for varying administrative burdens or the
complexities of different cases. Some matters may involve
voluminous evidence,
consultations with stakeholders, or legal intricacies that require more time
than straightforward cases.
A uniform 28-day deadline, for example, does not allow for flexibility to
accommodate these differences, potentially leading to administrative
inefficiencies or inconsistencies in decision-making processes. Decision-makers
may also be forced to prioritise speed over thoroughness,
compromising the
quality of the outcomes.
Imposing a hard deadline without providing adequate resources or mechanisms
to meet the timeline can lead to systemic inefficiencies.
Administrative bodies
may struggle with insufficient staffing or resources to handle their caseloads
within the deadline, exacerbating
backlogs or causing delays in other areas.
If the consequence of failing to meet the deadline is that the original
decision is deemed affirmed, as seen in some legislative frameworks,
undermine the right to a fair review process and negatively impact the
individuals or entities awaiting the decision. Thus,
a balance between
timeliness and procedural fairness is crucial in administrative
decision-making.
VI Conclusion
The obligation to provide written reasons in administrative decision-making
plays a crucial role in promoting transparency, accountability
and fairness
within legal and administrative systems. Written reasons not only serve as a
safeguard against arbitrary or capricious
decisions but also ensure that
decision-makers systematically address the legal and factual issues in each
By articulating the rationale behind a decision, decision-makers are forced
to engage with the relevant law, facts and evidence, which
risk of oversight or error. This process not only benefits the parties directly
involved in the case but also
enhances the broader legal system by contributing
to the development of legal principles and precedents.
In the context of administrative law, the provision of timely written reasons
is particularly important for enabling parties to understand
the basis of
decisions affecting their rights and interests. Clear and reasoned decisions
allow affected individuals or entities
to assess whether the decision was
lawful, fair and just, and whether they should seek an appeal or judicial
Without timely written reasons, parties may be left in a state of
uncertainty, unable to fully comprehend the rationale behind the
decision, or
worse, unable to take informed legal action. This is particularly concerning in
migration matters, as seen in cases

, where the stakes are often extremely high, involving fundamental
issues such as the right to remain in a country or protection from
However, while the importance of written reasons is clear, there are
challenges when these reasons are delayed, particularly in urgent
decision-making contexts. Administrative decision-makers may face practical
difficulties in providing immediate written reasons,
especially in cases where
decisions must be made quickly due to time-sensitive issues, such as visa
cancellations or deportations.
Nonetheless, even in such cases, it is essential that the decision-making
process remains intellectually rigorous and well-documented,
ensuring that the
reasons, when eventually provided, reflect the thorough and considered nature of
the decision. This balancing act
is critical for preserving accountability, as
delayed or inadequate reasons can foster perceptions of injustice and diminish
confidence in the system.
Further, delayed reasons can also complicate the judicial review process.
Courts, as well as oversight bodies, rely heavily on the
provision of written
reasons to assess whether a decision complies with the law and adheres to
established legal standards. Without
these reasons, the review process can be
stalled or rendered incomplete, leading to increased litigation and additional
cases such as
, where delayed reasons impacted the
applicant’s ability to seek timely legal advice, the consequences of such
delays become
even more evident, highlighting the broader implications of
procedural inefficiencies.
Thus, while the goal of timeliness in decision-making is essential, it must
be carefully balanced with the need for a fair, just and
thorough examination of
the issues. The practice of deferring written reasons, particularly in complex
or high-stakes cases, underscores
the importance of supporting administrative
bodies with adequate resources and flexibility to meet their obligations without
sacrificing
the quality of their decisions. Ultimately, the provision of
well-reasoned, transparent and timely decisions is central to maintaining
integrity of the legal system and ensuring that justice is served in both urgent
and routine administrative matters.
