APPLICATION
BY HALLET BRICK PTY LTD
[2016] SAWC
Judgment of
Senior Warden Dr Cannon (
ENERGY AND RESOURCES -
MINERALS - COURTS OR TRIBUNALS EXERCISING JURISDICTION IN MINING MATTERS - SOUTH
AUSTRALIA - WARDEN'S COURT
Revocation of Private Mines
APPLICATION
BY HALLET BRICK PTY LTD
the mid 1880’s the argument over who owned mineral rights was resolved and
all subsequent grants of freehold titles excluded
mining rights. Prior to that
permission to mine had to be obtained from the freehold owner. So it was that
the first commercial
mine in Australia, the Glen Osmond mine, was mined with the
permission of the owner of the freehold.
the mid 1880’s all other grants of freehold excluded mineral rights but
there had been substantial grants of freehold
title prior to that. When the
Mining Act 1971
came into force it resumed to the Crown all those mining
rights that had previously, prior to the mid 80’s, been granted to
landowners. So it was then that the Crown had decided in its executive
government to manage the granting of the right to mine, the
management of
mineral processes and of course taking benefits to the community rather than
individual land owners for the minerals
protect itself against a large claim for the loss of rights from people whose
mining rights had been taken back to the Crown it
created the notion of private
mines so that people who maintained the intention to exploit their private
mining rights were entitled
to do so outside the operation of the
and that has continued until this day. Most of the private mines have
now been brought to an end. Many were never exploited, just
held onto in case
there was some value to them and then let go when it was realised there was not.
Some have been very valuable and
have been mined extensively, particularly in
the extractive minerals area.
Wardens Court has a role in declaring that mines should be varied or revoked.
Section 73M
of the Act sets out that the Wardens Court may on application of the
Director of Mines or the proprietor of a private mine declare
that proper
grounds exist for the variation or revocation of the area as a private mine
under the Act. Proper grounds exist for
the purposes of sub-section (1) in the
case of an application by the proprietor if the Wardens Court is satisfied that
circumstances of the particular case it is appropriate that a
declaration be made. Prior to proceeding the court needs to pay attention
whether people who have a relevant interest have been advised. Under this
Section and also its predecessor this Court has always
had the view that where
someone has exploited the resource for private purposes before abandoning their
mining rights they should
be held to the responsibility to rehabilitate the land
into a safe and environmentally satisfactory state. If this court did not
attention to that there is a real risk that private mines would be abandoned,
leaving a large cost for rehabilitation for the
community to bear when all the
benefit from the mining has gone to the private operator, not the community,
subject of course to
some royalty arrangements in the Act. So it is that this
court has always wanted to be satisfied that proper rehabilitation is in
the particular instance before me this resource has been extensively mined. The
title details are set out in attachment 3 of the
very helpful report from the
Department of State Development and I notionally include those title
descriptions in attachment 3 into
these brief reasons. The applicant was the
former operator of the land of Private Mine 68 which was owned by Christies
Stone Quarries
Pty Ltd ACN007579704. Christies sold the majority of the land to
Land SA in June 2002. It remained the holder of the private mine.
Land SA and
the property developer and now proprietor MSP Property Holdings Pty Ltd have no
interest in the private mine. The only
parties with an interest in this area
are the applicant, Land SA, and MSP Property Holdings Pty Ltd and all of them
are aware of
this application. They all support this application.
half a million plus tonnes of resource was removed from this mine but operation
ceased in 1996. There is nothing so special
in the nature of the resource to
have any implications for the resources of the State by removing this private
mine and indeed the
resource has been exhausted. Part of the land has been used
for waste disposal since 1985 in accordance with an Environmental Impact
Statement. It is subject to a post closure management plan as set out by the
advisors BC Tonkin and Associates. That will be monitored
until 2021. There is
a mortgage in place to ensure compliance with the process of rehabilitation. A
portion of the land is being
used for motorbike safety training. Landfill gas
is being extracted from the landfill area and the rest is revegetated. In those
circumstances I am satisfied that the owner of the private mine has acted
appropriately, has in place appropriate machinery to ensure
rehabilitation and
has taken reasonable steps to make sure that the rehabilitation plan will be
carried out. In those circumstances
I find that proper ground exists for the
complete revocation of this private mine and I prepare a recommendation to the
accordingly.
