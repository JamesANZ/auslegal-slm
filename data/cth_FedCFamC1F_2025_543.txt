REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
SCHONELL J:
parties are engaged in proceedings pursuant to
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth) (“the Act”) which are listed for a
final hearing for three days commencing 20 October 2025. The parenting
of the interlocutory relief were heard on 25 July 2025. On 1 August 2025
orders were made dealing with the parenting matters with
the exception of
addressing an issue in relation to whether therapy should be reportable. In that
respect, the parties did not submit
to the Court a form of order until 4 August
2025 containing their agreement to various parenting matters, including an order
therapy. The agreed orders were made on 12 August 2025. I am satisfied that
the therapy should be reportable and will provide my
reasons for same in my
final reasons.
wife’s application for interim financial orders had only recently been
served necessitating its adjournment on 25 July 2025
to 12 August 2025. Each of
the parties’ counsel made brief submissions.
the wife had initially sought an order for $500,000 by way of partial property
order, she now seeks an order that the husband
pay her the sum of $400,000 by
way of partial property order. Such sum is in addition to $100,000 she is
entitled to pursuant to
orders made on 16 January 2024. By combination of
her counsel’s submission and the contents of her affidavit, I understand
she contends that she requires approximately $310,000 to enable her to retain
lawyers for the purposes of the final hearing, $100,000
to pay outstanding legal
fees and $100,000 to repay a loan. Without such funds to pay her legal fees, the
wife’s counsel submits
the wife will be unrepresented at the hearing.
husband opposes any order other than the $100,000 due to her by the orders made
16 January 2024. It is not in issue that the husband
has to date not
complied with the order but says that the problem is caused by the wife. I am
unable to resolve at this hearing who
is at fault.
context to the parties’ dispute is containing in my reasons recorded as
Hidaka & Hidaka
[2025] FedCFamC1F 516.
In addition to those matters,
it is apposite to observe that orders were made on 13 December 2023 restraining
the wife from disposing
of shares she held in K Company. It is clear from
her affidavit that she has breached that order and sold the shares with the net
proceeds currently held in a bank account in Country B which have a value of
approximately $580,000. As a consequence of actions
taken by the Country B
government she says she cannot withdraw those funds from Country B. It is
arguable that the position the wife
finds herself in is entirely a consequence
of her breaching orders of this Court.
wife’s counsel submits that the wife would be prejudiced by being unable
to partake in the litigation on an equal footing
with the husband. He points to
evidence in her affidavit sealed 28 November 2023 setting out a basis for the
making of a partial
property order on the basis of her contributions, says that
it would be unjust and inequitable if such an order were not made and
response to the husband’s assertions that the order could not be reversed
or taken into account submits that final orders
could be made transferring to
accounts of the husband in Country B part of the funds in the wife’s name
in Country B .
relation to the husband’s contention that the wife already holds greater
assets than the husband by virtue of her disposal
of a property in Country B,
her counsel submits that the circumstances in which she came to own and then
dispose of the property
demonstrate that not to be so and that the
husband’s evidence as to value of that property should be viewed with some
circumspection
given the husband asserted in February this year it had a value
of $109,000 and now asserts it has a value of $350,000 without any
evidence. He also submitted that an issue at trial will be how the husband has
dealt with cryptocurrency and, as best
I understood, the submission where and
how he has dealt with them.
husband contends that a payment to the wife of the magnitude sought would defeat
his ultimate claim and could not be considered
at a final hearing. In his Case
Outline, his counsel submits:
Wife’s receipt of $100,000, pursuant to Order 7(a) of the 16 January 2024
orders, provides her with sufficient liquidity
pending the final hearing.
current balance sheet annexed to these submissions shows that, if the
Wife’s further application for $500,000 were granted,
she would hold in
excess of 76% of the total net asset pool. It is also noted that the Wife has
placed a substantial portion of her
assets away from the Husband in [Country
would far exceed any reasonable estimate of her likely entitlement at final
hearing, particularly given the parties’ equal
contributions and the yet
to be determined
factors, which will depend on the children’s final
living arrangements.
the further payment sought would prejudice the Husband’s ability to meet
his own living and legal expenses pending
final hearing and would offend the
Strahan clawback principle.
APPLICABLE LAW
jurisprudence on the circumstances in which the Court can make an order for what
is colloquially called an interim or partial
property order is well settled. The
authority to make such an order is found through a combination of
Family Law Act 1975
(Cth) (“the Act”).
is the source of power, while
enables the making of the order.
Court must initially be satisfied that it is appropriate to make an order and
that it is it in the interests of justice to make
an order. If so, then it is
appropriate to consider whether a case has been established for the making of an
order pursuant to
of the Act. An exhaustive assessment of the
considerations pursuant to
of the Act is not required.

”), the Full Court observed:
relation to the first stage, in our view, when considering whether to exercise
the power under
of the Act to make an interim property order
the “overarching consideration” is the interests of justice. It is
not necessary
to establish compelling circumstances. All that is required is
that in the circumstances it is appropriate to exercise the power.
In exercising
the wide and unfettered discretion conferred by the power to make such an order,
regard should be had to the fact that
the usual order pursuant to

Wenz v Archer
[2008] FMCAfam 1119
(2008) 40 Fam LR 212
[53] It cannot be the case that a party who has an irresistible claim to a
substantial share of the property of the parties should
be held out of that
property while the matter is litigated ... particularly where the parties are
asset rich but have relatively
modest incomes ... Nor could it be appropriate
that a party should be denied the ability to liquidate assets when there are
needs for those resources, such as to meet debts which may result in the
party being pursued by creditors, or the need for the party
to make payments for
the benefit of the children, or to take advantage of other financial
opportunities

, the Full Court observed at
... the issue on such an application is not the question of whether one party
should be responsible for the costs of the other, nor
is it a question of
determining in advance whether any expenditure was reasonably or properly
incurred. It is rather, as it certainly
In the Marriage of Wilson
situation where one party to the marriage controls almost exclusively what might
be described as the patrimony of the parties
and has control of the bulk of the
assets and funds of the parties, where an order may be made to ensure that the
other party, who
does not have the fortune of controlling those funds, at least
has an equal or near equal opportunity to present his or her case.
Such an order certainly will be made on account of costs but what ultimately
will be the fate of the monies paid, whether it is to
be treated as an advance
on the ultimate property order, or whether it is to be treated as an advance on
any ultimate costs order
or a mixture of the two, is a matter which must be left
to the trial judge.
is it a necessary precondition to the making of an order that a party needs to
identify a particular fund. The Full Court in
Bing and Bing
[2007] FamCA 418
mere assertion that there are no immediately available funds to provide to the
applicant to enable him or her to continue on
with the proceedings cannot simply
be accepted at face value. If it is apparent that one of the parties controls a
vast pool of assets
(irrespective of whether those assets are readily capable of
liquidation) then the Court has a broad enough discretion to enable
an order to
be made for the provision of funds by the holder of those assets to enable the
other party to continue on with litigation...
And further, the Full Court observed:
it has been asserted that the husband was and remains unable to raise the
capital sum sought by the wife. This is a matter
which may become relevant if
and when the husband defaults in the order and an enforcement application is
brought. However, the question
of enforcement of the order remains a separate
question from the propriety of granting the order in the first place.

the authorities establish that the Court should consider the following in making
an interim property order:
(1) The onus is on the party seeking the order;
(2) The Court should act conservatively;
(3) Determine whether it is in the interests of justice to make an order;
(4) Consider whether a case is established to make a
order? A detailed
assessment of the

DISPOSITION
am satisfied that there is, in Australia, a fund of money that is available to
meet the wife’s claim from the funds held on
trust and from the
husband’s shares and cryptocurrency. I am also satisfied that a case has
been made under
of the Act for a property order.
issue is whether the wife has established the other necessary elements to enable
the Court to consider exercising its discretion
and whether it is just and
equitable to do so in the quantum sought or a different amount.

for the final hearing as is the expenditure by
the husband of cryptocurrency and
I am unable to resolve those issues at this interim hearing.
wife’s evidence as to the loan is opaque. She refers to a friend
transferring $46,000 to her lawyers. Her financial statement
is sealed 6 August
2025 but sworn 5 June 2025 and makes no reference to a loan. There is no more
updated financial statement. Her
affidavit sworn 11 August 2025 says she
seeks to use $100,000 to repay a loan but the evidence of that loan suggests
that she borrowed
only $46,000. The same affidavit incorporates a balance sheet
which omits any reference to a liability for a personal loan. There
evidence as to the terms on which the monies were advanced or that it is
immediately repayable. I am not satisfied that she
requires $100,000 now to
repay such a loan.
relation to legal fees, her affidavit sworn 17 July 2025 says that she would
incur $90,000 for the interim hearing and $310,000
for the final hearing. The
quantum is breathtaking in the context of the interim hearing and out of
proportion to the issues.
figures are to be compared to the cost notice filed 12 August 2025 which
contends that her outstanding legal fees are $86,000,
there was work in progress
of $15,250 and estimated future costs of $242,000 as against which there was
$66,000 in trust. Taking
these amounts into account, the wife’s
outstanding and future costs are estimated to be $277,250 not $400,000. I am
not satisfied
that she requires $400,000 to meet her present and future legal
is undoubtedly the case that if the order were made as sought by the wife, the
funds will be expended. Thus, the order is incapable
of being reversed given the
quantum of assets held by the wife in Australia. Whether it could be reversed by
transfer to the husband
in Country B is a matter for consideration at the final
hearing, but on the wife’s current evidence, it would require his return
to Country B to access it. In that respect, I note the wife’s evidence in
her affidavit of 17 July 2025 that the father is
facing criminal charges in
Country B as a result of the “kidnapping.”
parties are not agreed as to the pool of assets given the issue and value of the
Country B property. The wife also includes in
her balance sheet in her affidavit
of 11 August 2025, Country B legal fees and a Country B tax liability.

be satisfied that the order is capable of being
reversed or not defeat the husband’s final claim while also ensuring there
is to the extent possible an ability of the wife to take part in the litigation.
The onus is on the wife. I am not satisfied given
the uncertainty as to the pool
of assets and for the submissions advanced by the husbands counsel that she has
discharged that onus
for the payment of what amounts to $500,000.
am however satisfied that a lesser amount of $200,000 is a just and equitable
order and does not on balance imperil the husband’s
final relief while
providing the wife with sufficient funds to take part in the litigation. It is a
matter for her how she chooses
to spend it.

to these reasons.
