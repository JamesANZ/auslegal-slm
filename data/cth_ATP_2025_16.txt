INTRODUCTION
Panel, Jonathan Gidney, Ruth Higgins SC and
Deborah Page AM (sitting President), declined to make a declaration of
unacceptable
circumstances in relation to the affairs of Mayfield Childcare
Limited. The application concerned an alleged undisclosed association
certain Mayfield shareholders holding at least approximately 43%, and other
persons, some of whom participated in a placement
of shares completed by
Mayfield on 3 January 2025, in the context of an upcoming annual general
meeting at which resolutions concerning
the composition of the board are to be
considered. The Panel considered that the application was out of time under
section 657C(3)(a)
and decided not
to exercise its discretion to extend the time under section 657C(3)(b).
Accordingly, the Panel decided not to make
a declaration of unacceptable

and made various
submissions with reference to the indicia of association set out in
Iron Limited
[2008] ATP 4 and
Viento Group Ltd
[2011] ATP 1 including
as follows:
(a) the Alleged Connected Parties have demonstrated a shared goal to influence

company, including through Mr Misquitta’s actions in seeking to change the
composition of the board in January
2025 and May 2025
(b) Finexia and Lazarus have “significant commercial links” with the

Mr Misquitta
(c) there are structural links or examples of prior collaborative conduct
between the Alleged Connected Parties, including:
(i) PLC and Hoppers Lane (the sole shareholder of Genius Education) are related

Holdings’ shareholding in Mayfield, in favour of both Finexia and

deliberate responsive action to disguise these holdings, following
receipt of the S672A Tracing Notices

an identical change on resolution 2 within a 14-hour

Asset Holdings and Mr Carbone are acting in concert.
further submitted that the Alleged Connected Parties:
(a) have acquired control over voting shares in Mayfield other than in an
efficient, competitive and informed market contrary to
section 602(a)
(b) contravened section 606(1), as they have acquired a relevant interest in the
voting shares of Mayfield by way of transactions
which have increased their
voting power in Mayfield from a starting point above 20% to less than 90% and
(c) contravened section 671B, as they acquired a substantial holding in Mayfield

such an acquisition at the
relevant times, and public disclosures of their substantial holdings have been

prevented from:
(a) acquiring further shares, increasing their voting power in Mayfield or
increasing their relevant interest in Mayfield

shareholders’ meetings of Mayfield, should any such
meetings occur while
the Panel proceedings are ongoing.

acquisition of shares unless permitted by section 611.
have considered all the material but address specifically only that part of the
material we consider necessary to explain our reasoning.
Interim Orders
President of the Panel considered the request for interim orders on an urgent
basis and invited submissions from the Alleged Connected
Genius Parties submitted (among other things) that the interim orders would
appear to be disproportionate and unwarranted and
Parties’ interest (30.62%) itself is not in question
President considered the relevant factors for making an interim
Having regard to (among
other things), the transfers of Mayfield shares by certain of the Placement
participants following the
, the President
considered there was a risk that further transfers may occur which could present
difficulties for the sitting Panel
and may not be amenable to remedy by final
relief alone.
Accordingly,
the President made interim orders restricting the Alleged Connected Parties from
disposing of, transferring, charging
or otherwise dealing with their shares or
interests in shares in Mayfield (see Annexure A).
Preliminary submissions and decision to conduct
proceedings
Genius Parties provided preliminary submissions asserting that we should decline
to conduct proceedings. Among other things,
they submitted that:
(a) all relevant circumstances referred to in the application occurred well
before 2 months before the application and the application
is well out of
[i]t is accepted that there appears to
have been a technical (and in the Genius Parties' view, inadvertent) relevant
interest in the
30.62% relevant interest vested in 2021, extended to [Hoppers
Lane] by s608(3)
(c) while ultimately a matter for Hoppers Lane and Mr Wright, the Genius Parties
would be happy to provide such information as may
be required to assist in the
preparation of a Form 603 for this purpose
(d) Finexia Wealth and Lazarus are joint prime brokers and margin lenders to the
Genius Parties’ interest and their roles,
as the Genius Parties
understand, are limited to the provision of financial services and financial
advice to clients
(e) the transfers of shares by any other party to Finexia Wealth are not in any
way associated with the Genius Parties’ relationships
with Finexia
(f) Rothman, Mr May, Mr Carbone, OPM and Rush Asset Holdings have a
pre-existing commercial relationship with the Genius Parties (in
particular Mr Misquitta)
[s]ome were introduced into
the Placement opportunity... via Mr Misquitta, in response to a request for
assistance from [one of the
directors of Finexia] (who is known to Mr Misquitta
by reason of his commercial relationships with the Finexia entities)
(g) other than in relation to Hoppers Lane, in respect of the balance of the
Alleged Connected Parties, there is no “relevant
agreement” or
conduct amounting to “acting in concert”, and the mere existence of
commercial relationships, similar
voting patterns, or participation in a
placement does not establish association.
application, which was 39 pages, was very detailed and raised complex matters
including the prime brokerage and other financial
arrangements relating to the
Genius Parties’ shareholding in Mayfield. Notwithstanding the length of
the application, we considered
that the evidence going to the indicia of
association was somewhat limited. We were also mindful that the Genius Parties
had significant
voting power of approximately 30% in Mayfield on their own and
had held voting power at or above this level since the transaction
approved on 6
December 2021
(which did not
appear to be in dispute). However, we had some concerns in relation to (among
other things) the relevant interest
of Hoppers Lane (and PLC and Mr Wright) in
Mayfield, noting the acknowledgment in the Genius Parties’ preliminary
submissions,
potential substantial holder notice deficiencies, and the movement
of Mayfield shares following the Placement and the issuance of
tracing notices.

lodgement of the application. An application for a declaration

longer period determined by the

Alleged Association
asked the Genius Parties to provide further details about the
“pre-existing commercial relationship” they had with
Rothman, Mr
May, Mr Carbone, OPM and Rush Asset Holdings, and what role, if any, Mr
Misquitta had in relation to the Placement.
also asked each of the Placement participants a series of questions, including
why they decided to participate in the Placement
and why they voted the way they
did concerning resolutions 2, 3 and 4 of the upcoming AGM. We asked PLC,
Mr May and Rothman why
they decided to transfer their shares to Finexia
Wealth and what commercial arrangement was behind the transfer.
Genius Parties submitted:
(a) Mr May has consulted for one of Mr Misquitta's businesses under a
professional engagement and was introduced to the Placement
opportunity by
Mr Misquitta
(b) Rothman was introduced to Mr Misquitta by Mr Misquitta's accountant in the
context of the Placement
(c) Mr Joseph Carbone is known to Mr Misquitta in a historical, professional
context and has consulted for one of Mr Misquitta’s
businesses under a
professional engagement, but was not introduced to the Placement opportunity by
Mr Misquitta
(d) the son of one of the directors of OPM and a son of Mr Misquitta are
friends, but OPM was not introduced to the Placement opportunity
(e) Rush Asset Holdings, an experienced child care sector investor known in the
child care market, is known to, but was not introduced
to the Placement
opportunity by, Mr Misquitta
(f) they have no information regarding the transfer of Mayfield shares to
Finexia Wealth or Rush Asset Holdings
(g) in relation to voting at the AGM:
(i) the Genius Parties had no issue with the re-election of Ms Matta to the
board of the company
(ii) the Genius Parties had expressed their concerns regarding the re-election
of Mr Johnson in May 2025 to the company in light
of events that, in the Genius
Parties' view, were undesirable conduct by a listed company director and
therefore voted against his
re-election to the board and
(iii) there have been differences in voting decisions among the alleged
associates on resolution 2 and if there had been any association
as asserted by
Mayfield, it could reasonably be expected that the voting preferences would have
converged and
(h) this is not the first time, over a 12-month period, that the Mayfield board
has had to face a spill, referencing an extraordinary
general meeting (EGM)
called by another substantial shareholder in March 2024 to remove all of the
board members at the time and
appoint new directors.
Carbone submitted (among other things):
(a) he had had a number of positive interactions with Mayfield’s former
CEO and was approached by him in December 2024 regarding
the Placement and
suggested it might align with his investment approach and background
(b) Mayfield had come through a challenging period including an EGM in 2024 but
it appeared the worst was behind the company and
the Placement was an
opportunity to acquire a large parcel given the low liquidity in the
market for this stock
(c) his decision to participate in the Placement was made independently
(d) he had no involvement in the post-Placement transfers referred to in the
application and
(e) in relation to voting at the AGM:
(i) he initially voted in line with all of the company’s
recommendations
(ii) he changed his vote to support the spill and vote against the election of
Mr Johnson as a result of becoming aware of inappropriate
conduct involving
a Mayfield director posting anonymously on a public investor forum (Hot
(iii) he subsequently withdrew his support for the board spill after becoming
aware, through discussions with the former CEO of Mayfield,
that the two major
shareholders of Mayfield had been feuding and that Mayfield’s corporate
adviser considered that board spill
motions would be value destructive.
Parekh made submissions on behalf of Rush Asset Holdings, including as
I do not hold shares on behalf of PLC
bought the shares from PLC in a commercial transaction and I own them
(emphasis in original)
(b) he invested in Mayfield because he “
thought it was cheap compared
to the market and with a good prospect
(c) he is not associated with any other party and is happy to provide an
undertaking to this effect
(d) he initially voted for the board spill as he was “
aware of several
issues with the business and thought it was time for a fresh start
and the change came from “
speaking to a few people in the market that
it may disrupt the performance to have a complete spill of the

” and was “

(f) he voted for Ms Matta as he knew of her experience in childcare through his
business network.
did not receive submissions from the other Alleged Connected Parties.
rebuttals, Mayfield submitted (among other things):
(a) it considers the submissions of the Genius Parties to be
intentionally lacking detail to the point of being evasive
and an attempt to diminish and downplay the true nature of the relationships
between the Genius Parties and the other alleged
(b) it is particularly telling that PLC, Mr May and Rothman, which Mr Misquitta
acknowledges he introduced to the director of Finexia
to facilitate their
participation in the Placement, did not provide submissions and
(c) there is clearly enough evidence for the Panel to conclude, drawing
reasonable inferences, that the relationships and conduct
of the alleged
associates gives rise to association.
submissions and rebuttals, we had formed the following preliminary
(a) we did not consider, on the materials before us, that there was enough to
make a finding of association or other unacceptable
relationships. In
particular:
(i) we did not consider that either Mr Carbone or Rush Asset Holdings was part
of the alleged group of associates having regard to
their submissions and the
other material
(ii) we considered that the alleged concerted
actions between the Alleged Connected Parties could potentially be explained as
permissible
collective action
other conduct unlikely to constitute acting as associates or entering into a
relevant agreement giving rise to a relevant interest,
noting the Genius
Parties’ pre-existing 30.62% interest in Mayfield and the Genius
Parties’ submissions concerning Mr
Misquitta’s pre-existing
commercial relationships with a number of the Alleged Connected
(iii) while we had some concerns about the transfer by PLC of the Mayfield
shares it acquired under the Placement to Finexia Wealth
on the same day it was
sent a tracing notice from Mayfield, we considered that the subsequent transfer
of 2,500,000 shares of which
PLC was beneficial owner to Rush Asset Holdings
(being more than half of the shares PLC acquired under the Placement) weighed
a finding of association
(iv) we considered that the change of proxy voting by Finexia Wealth (OPM, PLC)
and others from “for” to “against”
the board spill
resolution at the upcoming AGM weighed against a finding of association and
(v) while we had concerns in relation to the lack of submissions received from
certain of the Alleged Connected Parties, we were
not prepared to draw the
inferences requested by Mayfield, including because of our comments at paragraph
(b) we had some concerns regarding whether it was in the public interest to
continue to investigate the alleged association, noting
(among other things) the
(i) each of the Genius Parties, Mr Carbone and Rush Asset Holdings had made
submissions indicating a level of shareholder discontent
with the Mayfield
(ii) in light of the orders requested, the application was causing a delay to
Mayfield’s AGM, where in addition to the resolutions
concerning board
composition, other matters were to be considered and
(iii) continuing the Panel proceedings was likely to involve a considerable time
and resource allocation including legal costs for
those involved, noting the
complexity of the matter.
regard to our decision not to extend time to hear the application (see below),
we did not consider we needed to reach a concluded
view on these
Alleged contraventions of section 606 and section 671B and
ASIC referral
the application, Mayfield submitted that, according to ASIC records, on
28 November 2024, Hoppers Lane (of which Mr Wright is the
sole director,
secretary and shareholder) became the sole shareholder of Genius Education and
that given Genius Holdings’ disclosed

Genius Education, holds a relevant interest in the shares held by Genius
in Mayfield and/or as a result of the transaction the parties became
associates.
asked the parties whether there had been a contravention of section 606 as a
result of the Hoppers Lane Genius Acquisition and
if so, whether this gives rise
to unacceptable circumstances.
Genius Parties’ submissions included as follows:
(a) Hoppers Lane was appointed trustee of the Misquitta Family Trust on
30 September 2020 because the existing trustee was placed

meaning of section
there appears to have been a technical contravention of section
606 as a result of deemed holdings on the part of Hoppers Lane. In
2021, Ashurst
was not the legal advisor of the Genius Parties at that time and we understand
the Genius Parties and Hoppers Lane
acted without the benefit of expert legal
advice concerning the application of Ch 6 of the
Corporations Act
. However the
Genius Parties confirm that the power to vote and dispose of the ordinary shares
in the Company has always been ultimately
vested in Darren Misquitta as
beneficiary of the Misquitta Family Trust, subject to the terms of the prime
broker agreements
(d) the Genius Parties have no intention of increasing their voting power in the
near future.

circumstances, on the materials presently before us we did not consider this
potential contravention of itself to be unacceptable.
That said, we are mindful
that a relevant interest extended to Hoppers Lane could have implications for
PLC’s acquisition
of shares in the
circumstances, we considered it appropriate to refer this aspect to ASIC for
further investigation. We did this on 4 July
the application, Mayfield had submitted that the substantial holder notices for
the Genius Entities dated 15 December 2021 and
21 May 2025, and accordingly the
Alleged Connected Parties’, are deficient, and that the public disclosure
of substantial holding
information has been deficient as a result of:
(a) Finexia becoming the registered holder of Mayfield shares exceeding the 5%
substantial holding threshold or there being a movement
of at least 1% in its
holding on each of 2 February 2024, 5 February 2024, 28 March 2024, 3 May 2024,
28 October 2024, 1 May 2025
and 6 May 2025
(b) Mr Wright commencing having effective control of Genius Education and Genius
Holdings under the Hoppers Lane Genius Acquisition
from 28 November 2024,
resulting in Mr Wright holding a relevant interest in Mayfield shares exceeding
the 5% substantial holding

commenced at a minimum
” on completion of the Placement on 3
January 2025 and
(d) OPM holding a relevant interest in Mayfield shares exceeding the 5%
substantial holding threshold (6.63%) on 1 May 2025.
asked the Alleged Connected Parties whether they had complied with their
obligations under Chapter 6C (as modified by ASIC) with
respect to any interests
in Mayfield and the matters and transactions referred to in the application,
including in connection with
any securities lending or prime
and whether any
contraventions of Chapter 6C give rise to unacceptable circumstances.
also asked the Genius Parties why the 2025 Genius Form 604 was given late
(noting it was given on 21 May 2025 but refers to a change
in interests on 3
January 2025) and why it refers to one or more prime brokerage agreements but
does not attach the agreement(s)
or provide the information required by
-(4C) (as inserted by ASIC Corporations (Securities Lending
Arrangements) Instrument 2021/821).
Genius Parties submitted (among other things):
(a) they did not appreciate the obligation under
section 671B(2)
to update ASX
in respect of the decrease (as a result of the Placement) of the ownership
interest of Genius Holdings and Genius Education,
noting that they did not
participate in the Placement
(b) the prime brokerage agreements the Genius Parties have with Lazarus and
Finexia Wealth do not result in a change of the Genius
Parties’ power to
vote and dispose of the ordinary shares of the company and the Genius Parties
did not believe such agreements to be material for purposes of the
2025 Genius Form 604
(c) ASIC Regulatory Guide RG 222: Substantial holding disclosure - Securities
lending and prime broking as well as ASIC Corporations
(Securities Lending
Arrangements) Instrument 2021/821 were considered in preparing the 2025 Genius
Form 604 and the Genius Parties’
approach accords with market practice
(d) while the delay in lodging the 2025 Genius Form 604 is acknowledged, the
Genius Parties note that, as disclosed in the Mayfield
Annual Report 2024 (at
page 55), Mayfield was already aware of the current voting power (30.26%, and
not 34.23% as noted in the earlier
substantial holder notice) and
(e) subject to the foregoing (in relation to the delay) the Genius Parties
consider that it is compliant with its obligations under
Chapter 6C.
submitted (among other things) that consistent with the decision in
Resources Limited
[2006] ATP 34, the right or interest, that must be
protected, is the right of Mayfield shareholders and other market participants
to know the information that the alleged associates were required to provide
under Chapter 6C and, in particular, to know of their
identity and status as

had some concerns in relation to the potential substantial holder notice
contraventions, noting that Mayfield had alleged several
contraventions and that
the Genius Parties appeared to acknowledge there had been certain deficiencies
in their disclosure, albeit
asserting that these were historical and had now
been corrected. We also note that the proceeding raised relatively technical
concerning substantial holder notice disclosure relating to the Genius
Parties’ prime broking arrangements with Finexia Wealth
and Lazarus. The
Genius Parties made submissions which referred to specific parts of ASIC RG 222,
including querying the interaction
. In the circumstances,
we considered that ASIC was better placed to investigate the potential
substantial holder notice contraventions
and, accordingly, we included this as
part of our ASIC referral.
Decision not to extend time
acknowledged in the application that elements of the unacceptable circumstances
as a whole may have occurred more than two
months before the application was
made. However, it submitted that the nature of the unacceptable circumstances
in this case as
at the date of the application were continuing; that is, there
is a continuing state of affairs where persons are acting in concert
proposing to act in concert in relation to the affairs of Mayfield.
similar argument concerning ongoing circumstances was considered recently in
Global Lithium Resources Limited
. We agree with the
observations made by the review Panel at [53] to [56] in that matter, in
particular that circumstances are not
rendered ongoing by treating ongoing
effects as part of the circumstances.
consider, for the purpose of
section 657C(3)(a)
, that the relevant circumstances
in Mayfield’s application occurred no later than 3 January 2025 when
Mayfield completed the
Placement. Therefore, we consider that the
application was out of time under
section 657C(3)(a).
Panel is given a discretion to extend the 2-month limit to make an
application
and in considering
whether to do so has regard to the following factors:
(a) the discretion to extend time should not be exercised lightly
(b) whether the application made credible allegations of clear and serious
unacceptable circumstances, the effects of which are ongoing
(c) whether it would be undesirable for a matter to go unheard, because it was
lodged outside the two month time limit, if essential
matters supporting it
first came to light during the two months preceding the application and
(d) whether there is an adequate explanation for any delay, and whether parties
to the application or third parties will be prejudiced
Panel also takes into account the public interest in deciding whether to extend
submitted that, to the extent the Panel considers that
section 657C(3)(a)
applicable, it should exercise its discretion to extend the time on various
bases, including as follows.
(a) Mayfield first became aware of “
some of the
circumstances
” giving rise to this application on 5 March 2025, being
more than two months after completion of the Placement
(b) Mayfield initially notified ASX and ASIC of the matters of which it was
aware of at the time
(c) the matters the subject of the application are complex and involved many
parties, and required considerable time to investigate
(d) Mayfield’s view was that there was insufficient information to meet
the hurdle test for a Panel application until additional
information came to the
attention of the company in May 2025. Since this time, Mayfield has sought
advice and has not unnecessarily
delayed in making the application
(e) the application provides at a minimum “
credible allegations of
clear and serious unacceptable circumstances, the effects of which are
(f) no parties to the application or third parties will be prejudiced by the
delay, especially given the AGM has been postponed.
Genius Parties submitted (among other things) that:
(a) Mayfield delayed in making the application until after the “May
Section 203D
Notice” and “May 249D Notice”, when the Genius
Parties’ views on the Board were made clear and public and
after the AGM
proxy deadline had closed
(b) the application raises matters from 2021 to
January 2025, or (at best) matters that Mayfield "
became aware of ... on 5
" and all relevant circumstances occurred well before 2 months
before the application (being 2 April 2025)
[w]e assume the Board took the
opportunity to consider the outcome of proxy votes for the AGM
(d) a delay in making an application in the context of an AGM should increase
the Panel’s reluctance to interfere with the
legitimate right of
shareholders to exercise voting rights, as it may do in the case of a
requisitioned meeting
[t]he above strongly suggests that the
Application is a defensive move by the Board to preserve their positions, rather
than a bona
fide attempt to address concerns regarding control.
strongly rejected the submissions set out at paragraph
above, asserting (among other
things) that they were without any factual basis and that the decision to bring
the application and
postpone the AGM was made at the “
earliest point in
time that such a decision could reasonably have been made
decision was in no way influenced by the receipt of proxy votes or the passing
of the proxy deadline. It further
submitted that the directors have acted in
good faith, in the best interests of Mayfield, and for a proper purpose.
acknowledge the difficulty that applicants face in association matters in
seeking to gather enough material to meet the ‘hurdle
unnecessarily delaying bringing the application. We had some sympathy for
Mayfield’s submissions in this regard.
However, Mayfield accepts that it
was aware of concerns regarding the conduct of the Placement from 5 March 2025.
As a result, we
consider there was some delay in bringing the application. The
discretion to extend time should not be exercised lightly. In view
observations above in relation to the alleged association and potential
contraventions of
section 606
we were not persuaded that
an extension of time was warranted here, including because we were not satisfied
on the materials before
us that there were credible allegations of clear and
serious unacceptable circumstances. Accordingly, we decided not to exercise
discretion to extend time under
section 657C(3)(b).
respond to brief
brief included a number of inquiries directed at all or some of the Alleged
Connected Parties. However, certain Alleged Connected
Parties did not engage
and hence we did not receive submissions in response to some of our questions.
The Panel expects parties
to provide responses to questions asked of them and we
remind parties of the Panel’s powers to summon
and conduct
conferences
during Panel
proceedings. In addition, in appropriate cases the Panel may draw adverse
inferences from a lack of response to a question
or failure to fully answer a
question. While we did not take those steps in this instance, if the
circumstances had been different
we may have done so.
the reasons above, we declined to make a declaration of unacceptable
circumstances. We consider that it is not against the public
interest to
decline to make a declaration and we had regard to the matters in
that we made no declaration of unacceptable circumstances, we make no final
orders, including as to costs.
