Broad v Brisbane City Council
[1986] 2 Qd R 317
LEGISLATION:
Planning Act 2016
Planning and Environment Court Act 2016
Mr N Batty for the appellant
Ms Rodgers for the co-respondent
SOLICITORS:
MacDonnells Law for the appellant
King & Company Solicitors for the co-respondent
appellant made a development application to the respondent, a private certifier,
to regularise a shed and extend it at his
property at 1 Upland Court,
Tinbeerwah, which is in the Rural Residential Zone. The co-respondent, in its
Referral Agency Response,
directed the respondent to refuse the application.
The decision of the co-respondent was confined to the shed not complying with,
and not being able to be conditioned to comply with, PO6 of the Rural
Residential Zone Code in its planning scheme.
Referral Agency Response, the relevant assessment benchmark is quoted in the
following terms:
Buildings and other structures are
designed and sited to:-
a) provide a high level of amenity to users of the subject site and adjoining
premises, including provision of visual and acoustic
and protection from noise, odour or artificial lighting;
b) provide adequate distance from adjoining land uses and avoid conflict
with existing or future rural uses and activities on adjoining
The reasons for directing the respondent to refuse the application are stated
as follows:
It has been considered that the proposed buildings located within the side
boundary setback has [sic] the potential to impact the
amenity of the users of
the adjoining premises. There is very little justification for Council to
support the location of buildings
within the side boundary setback.
Additionally, it is suggested that there are alternative design options
available for which the buildings may be located that would
reduce the potential
impact on the users of the adjoining premises [sic]. It is anticipated that
buildings and structures located
on large scale rural residential properties
achieve greater separation, providing adequate distances from adjoining land
appellant had a choice pursuant to sch 1, table 1 of the
Planning Act
(“PA”) to either appeal to the Planning and Environment
Court or a development tribunal. He chose to appeal to the court.
Before me is
an application pursuant to
Planning and Environment Court Act 2016
seeking an order remitting the appeal to a development tribunal on the basis
that “the court is satisfied that the matter should
be dealt with by the
[4] Development
tribunals are established pursuant to ch 6,
of the PA. They are clearly
intended to provide a quick, inexpensive forum for minor development disputes.
In s 249(6) it states
that a tribunal need not proceed in a formal way and may
inform itself in a way it considers appropriate. Pursuant to s 248, a party
tribunal proceedings may appear only in person or by an agent who is not a
co-respondent submits, essentially, that the ambit of this dispute and the
likely cost to rate payers of the appeal continuing
in the court warrants a
remittal of the dispute to a tribunal. Conversely, the appellant essentially
submits that he wishes to pursue
his development rights in the court with the
benefit of legal representation.
[6] The problem
with the application is that the concept of amenity is, to quote de Jersey J in
Broad v Brisbane City Council
[1986] 2 Qd R 317
at 326, “wide and
flexible”. In my view, it is a concept better litigated in a court with
legal representation and the
opportunity to explore the concept with the benefit
of expert evidence in the context of the appropriate statutory framework.
[7] I have not
been provided with a copy of the respondent’s planning scheme, although
exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Geaney,
filed 23 May 2025, is a copy of the
Rural Residential Zone Code in its entirety. I note that amenity considerations
in PO6 are more
extensive than those quoted in the Referral Agency Response and
speak in terms of allowing for space for landscaping to be provided
buildings and preserving existing vegetation that will help buffer
development.
regard to the material before me, such considerations are also relevant in
assessing amenity implications having regard
to the location of the proposed
shed. I do not know where PO6 sits in the context of the planning scheme as a
whole and of the way
overall outcomes, which also call up amenity
considerations, interact with the relevant performance outcomes. Regardless,
the weighing
of these provisions needs to occur in the context of established
canons of statutory interpretation and the resolution of this dispute
largely upon the exercise of the discretion of the decision-maker when weighing
the relevant provisions of the assessment
benchmarks.
[9] It is true
that this appeal is about a shed but the co-respondent has directed that it not
be built in a rural residential area
for unparticularised, amorphous reasons.
Accordingly, it is a dispute better litigated in the court rather than before a
which is better suited, in my view, to determine matters which are
essentially technical in nature.
[10] In the
circumstances, the application is refused.
