MODIFICATION OF BUILDING REGULATIONS
– An application
(Application 1) commenced in the Building Appeals Board (
October 2024 and made under
s 160B(1)(a)
Building Act 1993
) for a determination that an access provision cl F2.4 of the
Building Code of Australia, 2019 - Volume One
) ought not
apply to a Class 8 building – whether compliance with access provision
would impose unjustifiable hardship, to permit
the existing Winery Building to
not have accessible sanitary facilities but instead relying on the sanitary
facilities in the adjacent
Wine Bottling Shed – whether there would be
unjustifiable hardship in the event of compliance.
MODIFICATION OF BUILDING REGULATIONS

(Application 2) commenced in the BAB on 14 October 2024 and made under s
160(2)(b) of the Act for a determination
to modify cl F2.3 of the BCA, applying

APPEARANCES
For the Applicant
Leighton Joy, director of the Applicant
For the First Interested Party No appearance
applications concern an already existing Winery Building at 1647 Glenlofty
Warrenmang Road, Warrenmang (
the Subject Land
summary they concern:
a) An application made under 160B(1)(a) of the
Building Act 1993
) to not have to provide accessible sanitary facilities in the Winery
Building because the nature of the work and equipment within
the building lends
itself to users of the Winery Building to be able bodied persons (
Application
b) An application made under
s 160(2)(b)
of the Act to not be required to
provide sanitary facilities in the Winery Building because sanitary facilities
are available in
the nearby Wine Bottling Shed (
Application 2
owner of the Subject Land is Middle Creek Vineyard Pty Ltd and these
applications have been made on its behalf by Mr Kevin Joy,
an architect.
applications state and we accept that the Winery Building on the Subject Land is
a Class 8 processing building.
Applicant submits the Winery Building is an unsafe work environment for persons
with a disability because:
(a) During the operation of the wine making process there are large diameter
suction and delivery hoses on the floor which would
impede wheelchair movement
within the building.
(b) There is constant movement of unmonitored forklift activity, as well as the
work requiring manual lifting and rolling of heavy
wine barrels.
addition, the Applicant submits that the work required to be carried out in the
Winery Building could not be undertaken by a person
with a disability.
Applicant has supplied sketch plans and photographs of the interior and exterior
of the winery building. The photographs show
hoses running across the floor,
barrels, tanks, racks and pallets.
RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE
following parts of the
Building Code of Australia 2019 Volume One
are relevant:
Personal hygiene
FP2.1 Suitable sanitary facilities for personal hygiene must be provided in a
convenient location within or associated with a building,
to the degree
necessary, appropriate to—
(a) the function or use of the building; and
(b) the number and gender of the occupants; and
(c) the disability or other particular needs of the occupants.
relation to the application 1, we find that access to the Winery Building for
people with a disability would be inappropriate because
of the purpose for which
the area is used, and the Winery Building would pose a health or safety risk for
people with a disability,
therefore cl F2.4 of the BCA does not apply and would
have an unjustifiable hardship.
relation to the application 2, we note that cl FP2.1 of the BCA provides that
sanitary facilities may be provided in a convenient
location associated with a
building. We find that because sanitary facilities are provided in the nearby
Wine Bottling Shed as demonstrated
in the application before us, a modification
to cl F2.3 of the BCA is not required.
