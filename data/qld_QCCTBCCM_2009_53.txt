REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
application in this proceeding was filed on 26 May 2009. The application is
brought by the owners of Lot 7 in the community titles
scheme known as
“Beachcomber International” Community Titles Scheme 5429
(“CTS”). The application seeks
an adjustment of the lot
entitlements in both the Contribution Schedule and the Interest Schedule of the
CTS. It is brought pursuant
section 48(1)(b)
Body Corporate and
Community Management Act 1997
facilitated by
Commercial and Consumer Tribunal Act
accordance with section 48(2) of the
, the respondent is the Body
Corporate of the CTS. It filed its defence on 1 July 2009.
both parties filed written statements, the proceeding was set down for hearing
on 4 November 2009. At the hearing, given the
absence of contest between the
parties as to the actual evidence, the hearing proceeded by way of both parties
making oral submissions
to the Tribunal, with the written submissions prepared
by the respondent providing the framework for dialogue between the parties
the Tribunal.
leave of the Tribunal, the respondent filed an affidavit affirmed by Mr Bruce
Harper on 4 November 2009, which became Exhibit
Tribunal having heard the parties’ submissions and having analysed the
material filed, including that attached to the application,
determines that
there is sufficient evidence for the Tribunal to make an adjustment in the
circumstances, but only for the Contribution
Schedule, for the reasons which
Relevant legislation
is not in dispute between the parties that the relevant legislation is contained
in sections 46, 47, 48 and 49 of the
is also not in contention between the parties that the relevant principle to be
applied by the Tribunal with respect to the Contribution
Schedule is that stated
in section 48(6) of the
(namely, that the respective lot
entitlements should be equal, except to the extent to which it is just and
equitable in the circumstances
for them not to be equal). Similarly, for the
Interest Schedule, it is common ground that, pursuant to section 48(7), the
lot entitlements should reflect the respective market values of the
lots included in the scheme when the Tribunal makes the order,
except to the
extent to which it is just and equitable in the circumstances the individual lot
entitlements to reflect other than
respective market values of the lots.
it remains to be noted that section 49(4) states that, among the matters the
Tribunal may have regard to for deciding whether
an adjustment should be made
for both the Contribution Schedule and the Interest Schedule, by section 49(4)
, such include –
the community titles scheme is structured;
nature, features and characteristics of the lots included in the scheme;
purposes for which the lots are used.
Relevant legal
it is not in dispute that the relevant principles about the correct construction
of sections 46 to 49 (inclusive) of the
in circumstances such as
these in this proceeding are governed by the Court of Appeal decision in
Fischer v Body Corporate for Centrepoint Community Titles Scheme 7779
[2004] QCA 214
[2004] 2 Qd R 638.
for reasons to be analysed later, the Tribunal is not able to adjust the
Interest Schedule for this CTS, it is sufficient
to refer to some aspects of
which affect a potential adjustment of the Contribution Schedule
for this CTS. They are:
considerations of amenity, value and history are to be “disregarded”
because what is at issue is the “equitable”
distribution of
“costs”: at 644 [26];
the nature of a
contribution lot entitlement schedule itself suggests that the allocation of lot
entitlements is to be made on the
basis of the impact that individual lots make
upon the costs of operating and running a community titles scheme, since
contribution
lot entitlements determine the lot’s share of the outgoings:
at 645 [31];
the starting
point is that the entitlements “should be equal”, with a
“departure” from that principle being
“allowable only”
where it is just, or fair, to recognise inequality: at 645 [31];
such a departure
must take as its reference point the proposition for which it departs, namely,
that lot owners “should contribute
equally to the costs of the
building”, with the focus of the inquiry being on the extent to which a
lot “unequally”
causes costs to the body corporate: at 645
application for the adjustment of contribution lot entitlements, if the inquiry
is “limited” to the extent to which
a lot creates costs, or consumes
services, above or below the average, one can “readily determine”
what the contribution
lot entitlement should be – but if the inquiry be
wider and include such “nebulous criteria” as the structure of
scheme, or the nature, features and characteristics of the lots in the scheme,
and “the purposes for which they are used”,
there is “no
intelligible basis” on which a vast variety of circumstances might be
relied upon “to depart from,
and therefore erode, the principle said to be
paramount” (namely, that there should be an equality of entitlements): at
section 49 of
, and in particular section 49(4), should be construed as
meaning that those identified matters to which a Tribunal may have regard
be regarded only to the extent “if any” that they affect the
“cost of operating” a community titles
scheme: at 646 [33].
Principles concerning onus
Member Mackenzie QC considered the issue of onus in
Holland v Body Corporate
for Ellenmac CTS 16423
[2009] CCT KL002-09. He held that the ultimate onus
remains on the applicant to establish that the adjustment applied for ought
be made, even though the evidential onus may shift during the course of the
proceeding, according to the state of the evidence:
at [5]. Importantly, he
noted that, while it is plainly not necessary for professional evidence to be
called in matters under section
48(1) of the
, there may be cases
– of which the one under his consideration was one – where more
evidence may be desirable on the
critical issue of whether the current
assignment of contribution entitlements does in fact require adjustment because
the applicants does not give rise to or consume a substantial
disproportion of expenses: at [25]. Lastly, he considered the due
weight must
be given to the primary emphasis on equality and that a decision on that issue
must, in practical terms, be a somewhat
robust and pragmatic one: at [26].
the evidence that was finally presented to the Tribunal at the hearing, it was
not in issue that:
there is no Lot
1 and no Lot 14, the latter having been subdivided into what is now Lots 20 and
21 (containing, respectively, areas
of 63 square metres and 47 square metres),
although the reason why the subdivision was approved must be disregarded as
simply “history”;
Lot 2 comprises
13 floors on which there are 62 residential units containing 1 or 2 bedrooms, as
well as a restaurant, lifts and internal
corridors, with exclusive use areas for
parking, for the podium and for the roof area, and for corridors and elevators -
by By-Law 23 of the New Community Management Statement, the proprietor
of Lot 2, with respect to all such exclusive use, “shall
at all times
repair and maintain the same”; and
the remaining 18
Lots [numbered 3 to 21 (inclusive, but excluding 14)] are
“commercial” lots.
lot entitlements for all Lots, both for the Contribution Schedule and the
Interest Schedule, are identical as between Schedules,
with Lot 2 being
allocated 63 entitlements in both, and all other Lots, apart from Lots 7, 12 and
13, which are allocated 2 entitlements,
having an allocation of 1
entitlement.
Respondent’s submissions
respondent’s primary argument is that the applicants’ claim should
be dismissed because the claim itself and the supporting
evidence do not
properly engage the requirements, in particular sections 48 and 49, of the
as required by
summary terms, the submission is to the effect that there has been insufficient
attention given to each of the different items
of costs contained in the
relevant Budgets for either, or both, of the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 years for
the CTS so as to show to
what extent, if any, the Lots did, or did not,
disproportionately give rise to expenses or disproportionately consume services
the items in the Budgets do detail.
attention was paid by the respondent to the way in which it is alleged that the
applicants dealt inadequately with the
utility infrastructure concerning the
“extractor fans” located in Lots 3 and 7, although the
“history” of
how Lot 7 may have “benefited” is
irrelevant, as least in terms of seeking to apply some kind of estoppel to the
were many more bases relied upon by the respondent, but the above analysis shows
the flavour of the respondent’s approach.
Necessarily,
those aspects are directed to the Contribution Schedule only. With respect to
the Interest Schedule, the respondent
makes the very valid point that there has
been no evidence of “respective market values” of the lots and that
the applicants
relied specifically on three criteria only, being –
distribution of assets and the common area;
insurance premiums; and
local government rates and charges.
Applicants’ submissions
way in which the hearing was conducted was that the Tribunal sought, first, that
the respondent address the detail of the written
submissions, which it handed
up, in the initial part of the dialogue between the Tribunal and the parties,
following which the applicants,
then, were given an opportunity to specifically
respond to the written submissions, and any other matters seen to be
applicants’ response concentrated, almost entirely, on the
“extractor fans”. They submitted that, while Lots
3 and 7 used the
extractor fans, Lot 9 (which is currently being used as a café) also had
access and that other lots may be
able to use the extractor fan system because
the actual extraction point was on the roof of the building. Additionally, they
evidence that the costs concerning the fan and the motor, at least so far
as the Sinking Fund was concerned, for this building which
was constructed in
approximately 1989, involved proposed expenditure of $3,213.00 in 3 years time
and $6,229.00 in 7 years time.
In this context, it should be noted that it was
not in dispute between the parties, particularly as illustrated by Exhibit 1,
the total expenses for the 2008-2009 Budget were $193,335.00 and for the
2009-2010 Budget were $201,422.00. As can be readily extrapolated,
year period, the expenses in question are in the order of $2m (assuming that
inflation over that time will not exceed,
at least by much, the current rate).
Thus, a total figure in the order of $9,500.00, even spread over the earlier
period from, say,
1990 to the year 2015, would reduce such a payment to a very
small proportion of the overall budgets for that time. It should be
the Body Corporate was unable to identify in any way any specific
“administrative” based costs for the extractor
fans, other than
indicating that any such costs would be included in Item 6–1460 of the
Budgets (which themselves gave no clue
as to how such specific costs could be
ascertained).
Consideration
it is true that the applicants’ evidence and claims did not take into
account the impact of By-Law 23, the Tribunal clearly
can. As analysed in
, it is not the requirement of the relevant legislation that an
application will fail in the absence of expert evidence, unless there
absent sufficiently cogent evidence which would support an adjustment: at [13].
There is no requirement that the Tribunal
accept only the contentions advanced
once it has jurisdiction to determine the proceeding.
the applicants’ “GROUNDS” attached to the Application, there
are 7 pages which, while they could be described
as being in
“narrative” form, still do canvass the position of Lot 7, the
commercial nature of Lots 3 to 21 (inclusive)
and most of the items in the
2008-2009 Budget. It is simply not true that evidence has not been put before
the Tribunal concerning
such costs and how, at least in the applicants’
view, they affect the various lots. While it is true that the analysis
by the applicants does not accord with many of the principles set out
, it is not the case, as has occurred in other proceedings,
that there has been such a lack of evidence before the Tribunal that the
Tribunal could not in the discharge of its functions make a properly informed
decision concerning any adjustment. The very fact
that the respondent has
itself, in Exhibit 1, descended to particularity concerning the 2 Budgets in
question and has presented other
evidence is indicative of the fact that, at the
end of the hearing, the Tribunal has been appraised of sufficient relevant
material to consider whether the claim for an “adjustment”
can be validly determined.
should also be remembered that there is a shifting evidential onus, in this case
at least in part, on the respondent, to counteract,
or contradict, the essential
import of the totality of the evidence led, which import is that the
equality required by section 48(6) concerning the Contribution
Schedule had, arguably at least, been established, despite any deficiencies
the actual words used by the applicants in their claims and submissions.
a careful reading of all the evidence shows is that the present lot entitlements
in the Contribution Schedule are, except for
Lots 7, 12 and 13, essentially an
allocation of a lot entitlement of “1” to each Lot (or separately
notional lot area within Lot 2). Concerning Lot 2, the fact
that there are 62 residential lots (being time-share units) and 1 restaurant
indicates that the allocation of an entitlement of “63” achieves
that goal. And, as already observed, apart from Lots
7, 12 and 13, each
existing commercial lot also has an allocation of “1”.
for the moment, on the Contribution Schedule, and looking at each of the items
in both relevant Budgets, it can be demonstrated,
at least on the balance of
probabilities, that there is nothing inherent in those items of expenditure
which demonstrates in the
way required by
that “one can
readily determine” that identifiable Lots do in fact create costs, or
consume services, above or below
the average. Rather, what the analysis shows
is that the “starting point” of the entitlements being equal has not
demonstrated to be one that should be departed from, because there is
nothing that shows that it is just, or fair, to recognise inequality
from those items of expenditure.
particular, given, at least with respect to the “extractor fans”,
that Lot 3 – unlike Lot 7 - only has a lot
entitlement of “1”,
as does Lot 9, and given that there is absolutely nothing, except size (which
will be dealt with
next), which demonstrates why Lots 7, 12 and 13 should be
treated differently from any other commercial Lot, the Tribunal is satisfied
that the onus on the applicants has been discharged in showing that the present
inequality is not just and equitable and that, beginning
at the starting point
of equality, there is nothing in the evidence (particularly given the nature of
the evidential onus) which
shows that the
prima facie
equality that the
legislation, as interpreted by
demands should be disturbed.
Regarding the evidential onus, it is interesting that no evidence was led by the
respondent Body Corporate
concerning whether or not the extractor fan system
– given its function – was also accessible by the restaurant in Lot
2, considering that it was common ground that the system extended to the rooftop
of the building and, therefore, passed through,
by or adjacent to Lot 2. But
even if this common extractor system is not available to Lot 2, its
“costs” are an insufficient
basis for resisting an adjustment for
Lots 7, 12 and 13 to equality, or approximate equality, with other Lots –
and no submission
has supported an allocation of lot entitlements that would
number some 3, or even 4, figures for each of these Lots.
respect to the issue of size, there does seem to be merit in the
applicants’ submission that the only reason that Lots
7, 12 and 13 were
given a lot entitlement which was 100% more than other commercial lots (and each
of the residential “lots”
and the restaurant within Lot 2) is the
difference in size. But the original allocation of the lot entitlements in the
Contribution
Schedule, in their change from “1” to “2”,
appears to have been simply based on an arbitrary point of difference
which, on analysis, seems to have been – at least before the subdivision
of Lot 14 - 50 square metres. But the anomaly
in the position of Lot 7, 12 and
13 is strengthened by the way in which the former Lot 14, which became Lots 20
and 21, changed from
a lot entitlement of “2” for the original 110
square metres to a lot entitlement of “1” from its offspring
though the new Lot 20 was still 63 square metres – and, as observed
earlier, the “why” of this history is
present irrelevant.
has been nowhere demonstrated that there is a logical difference which sounds in
a differentiation of costs resulting from the
difference in size, particularly
when Lot 7 is 57 square metres and, for instance, Lots 3, 8, 10, 11, 16 and 19
(beside Lots 20 and
21) are equal to or greater than 45 square metres.
Certainly, there is no logically probative reason as to why Lots 7, 12 and 13
should be bearing 100% more lot entitlements than other commercial lots, and why
any commercial lot should be exposed to 100% more
expense than any residential
unit, or the restaurant, within Lot 2.
respect to the Interest Schedule, since it is the case that the applicants have
led no valuation evidence in a form acceptable
to the Tribunal about the
“respective market values” of the lots included in the scheme
“when” this Tribunal
is about to “make ... the order”,
it is impossible for the Tribunal to proceed to consider the other (potentially
interesting)
arguments raised concerning whether such respective market values
should be ignored, and to what extent, because it somehow otherwise
proved to be just and equitable in the circumstances for such lot entitlements
in the Interest Schedule to reflect other
than those “established”
respective market values. In other words, the principle applicable to the
Interest Schedule
under section 48(7) of the
has not been
triggered by the evidence led in this application.
Conclusions
just observed, there is insufficient material on which this Tribunal can even
consider, much less determine, an adjustment of the
lot entitlements in the
Interest Schedule.
respect to the Contribution Schedule, although there are some difficulties with
the evidence, unlike the actual facts of the
, and while,
perhaps this case is also “close to the borderline”, it is the
Tribunal’s determination that there
is sufficient evidence before the
Tribunal to make a relevant adjustment of the lot entitlements in the
Contribution Schedule in
accordance with the relevant legislative provisions as
interpreted by
determination is to the effect that:
the present lot
entitlements are unequal;
sufficient evidence before the Tribunal to apply the basic principle required by
section 48(6) of the
to the effect that all lot entitlements
should be equal (in circumstances where Lot 2 comprises 63 individual units of
space constituting,
for present purposes, notional lots in this CTS); and
it has not been
demonstrated to the Tribunal that it is just and equitable in the circumstances
for inequality to prevail, and certainly
not inequality to the extent of a
limited number of Lots being required to pay twice as much as all other Lots, or
notional lots.
Accordingly,
the Tribunal will make orders adjusting the lot entitlements in the Contribution
Schedule but will not make any orders
adjusting the lot entitlements in the
Interest Schedule.
respect to costs, both parties have agreed that the legal representation by the
respondent at the hearing on 4 November 2009
provides no basis for a claim of
costs to be made by the respondent against the applicants irrespective of the
outcome of the application.
Considering
that condition of appearance, considering the outcome concerning the Interest
Schedule, and considering what is required
of the Tribunal in accordance with
sections 70 and 71 of the
, as interpreted in
Tamawood Limited
[2005] QCA 111
[2005] 2 Qd R 101
, there will be no order as to costs.
