ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY
the following Enduring Power of Attorney for LAD is revoked pursuant to
Powers of Attorney Act 1998
and section 84(2) of the
Guardianship and Administration Act 2000
(a) The Enduring Power of Attorney dated 16 March 2005 appointing
AR as attorney for financial, personal and health matters.
REASONS FOR DECISION
[1] On the 19 June 2009 an application was made by EA, Social Worker, a care
facility, seeking the appointment of a guardian and
an administrator for
[2] The application was heard by the Guardianship and Administration Tribunal on
2 September 2009.
[3] Those persons attending the hearing were:
LAD, the adult
EA, the applicant
AR, attorney, by telephone from Darwin
The Adult Guardian represented by Jane Antoine, by telephone from
Interested parties:
HJ, friend of the adult
Legal representative:
NC, C & G, Solicitors was granted leave to represent the adult.
[4] LAD is 66 years of age and is in receipt of a single age pension. He also
receives lifestyle support from a care facility which
has registered him as
eligible for support under the
Disability Services Act
[5] He first suffered from epilepsy when he was 15 yrs and just leaving school.
He worked initially at a meatworks and then for 25
years at a coke works. He was
made redundant when the works underwent mechanisation.
[6] LAD has a keen interest in woodworking as a member of the XXX Woodworkers.
Until June this year he attended regularly with transport
provided by his friend
[7] He lives north Queensland in a house which he owns jointly with AR. AR and
PK, described as a live-in carer, also live in the
[8] Prior to moving to this address, LAD lived for 25 years at a house property
near by. This is understood to have formerly been
his parent’s home with
whom he lived.
[9] AR gave evidence that he met LAD in 2002 when he was residing in a house
next door. They became friends both having an interest
in woodworking and when
the house was sold he moved in with LAD. AR was at that time a Social Worker
with Queensland Health.
[10] PK’s evidence is that she met both LAD and AR in the course of her
activities as a door to door salesperson for Avon and
other household products.
She described LAD as a good customer.
[11] On 14 March 2005, LAD attended at the Bowen office of C & G,
Solicitors, to make a will. When questioned by the Tribunal
NC indicated that AR
was one of the beneficiaries.
[12] On advice from NC at the time of making his will, LAD also gave
instructions for an Enduring Power of Attorney which he executed
on 16 March
2005. He appointed AR as attorney for personal/health and financial matters.
[13] Later in the hearing in response to questions by the Tribunal, NC advised
that she also acted for LAD in the transfer of a ½
interest in the former
property to AR. The transaction was by way of gift.
[14] In 2006, LAD and AR purchased the present property. AR said that he
couldn’t recall the exact purchase price, but indicated
that it was
$315,000 to $318,000. The purchase price was provided from the $180,000 proceeds
of sale of the former property and a
loan secured by mortgage. A year later the
adjoining land was also purchased for $80,000 with the price being financed by a
secured by mortgage over both properties. AR said in evidence that there
are 3 loans amounting to $376,000, which includes funds
for renovations. The
certificates of title indicate that the properties are subject to 4 mortgages.
DOES THE ADULT LACK CAPACITY FOR THE MATTER?
[15] Under the
Guardianship and Administration Act 2000
Tribunal can appoint a guardian or administrator, it must first be established,
on the balance of probabilities, that the
adult concerned lacks capacity to
understand the nature and effect of a decision about a personal matter or a
financial matter. Personal
matters relate to such things as health care,
accommodation and services; while financial matters concern financial, property
legal transactions.
, for a person for a
matter, means the person is capable of-
(a) understanding the nature and effect of decisions about the matter;
(b) freely and voluntarily making decisions about the matter; and
(c) communicating the decisions in some way.
[16] An adult is presumed to have capacity for a matter.
[17] The Tribunal was provided with a Health Professional Report from Dr K dated
10 June 2009.
[18] At the outset of the hearing NC objected to the admission of this evidence
on the basis that her client’s consent to the
release of medical
information pursuant to a document called “
Confirmation & Consent
to Release Information
” signed by LAD on 12 February 2009 (the care
facility document used for a variety of purposes) did not extend to the
application
before the Tribunal.
[19] This argument was considered to lack any substance since it clearly
overlooked the provisions of
section 130
Guardianship and
Administration Act 2000
She readily revealed that she had a copy of the
report in her possession and provided it when ordered.
[20] Dr K says in his report that he has known LAD for 23 years. He has suffered
from epilepsy since 1977 and has a low IQ. Epilim
and Tegretol are his current
medications. Dr K says that LAD has a major problem with non-compliance with
medication. In relation
to decision-making, Dr K considers that LAD has limited
ability to understand and act on information relevant for making decisions
personal health care and lifestyle and accommodation choices. In his opinion,
LAD is incapable of managing his financial affairs.
He is also not capable of
making decisions freely and voluntarily.
[21] Dr K goes on to say in his report that while LAD is able to make simple
decisions about personal and financial matters, he is
not able to make complex
decisions on any of these matters. He did not assess his capacity to make an
Enduring Power of Attorney.
[22] With his report Dr K provided an extract from patient records of a Medical
Centre which read “approach from Union Rep
– working in sheltered
conditions at Coke Works but now has to rotate to various jobs involving
machinery – for review
by Medico & retirement & invalid pension on
grounds of Epilepsy & Mental Retardation”.
[23] Clearly, Dr K’s opinion, which is also supported by other material
before the Tribunal and later referred to, is sufficient
to displace the
presumption of capacity such that the question of LAD’s capacity becomes a
live issue for determination by
the Tribunal on the balance of
probabilities.
[24] NC informed the Tribunal that she had acted for LAD for 4 years. She had
taken instructions from him on his own in relation
to his will and the Enduring
Power of Attorney. She had also acted for him in relation to the transfer of the
½ interest in
his parent’s property to AR, the subsequent sale of
this property, the purchase of the current property and the loan transactions
secured by mortgages. In the later transactions, she also acted for AR. Both AR
and LAD were present when instructions for these
transactions were taken. At all
times she was satisfied that LAD had the requisite capacity for the
transactions.
[25] Questioned by the Tribunal in relation to the making of the Enduring Power
of Attorney. She did not question him about his financial
situation adding that
she already knew that he owned a house. She did not take notes of her interview
but said that she would ordinarily
take a client through the Statement of
Understanding. She was satisfied that he understood the nature and effect of the
Power of Attorney but was not able to say how she tested his
understanding.
[26] LAD told the Tribunal that he first suffered epilepsy when he was 15 years
when he was just finishing school and gave something
of his work history. He was
asked a variety of questions in general terms about his source of income, the
purpose of an Enduring
Power of Attorney, the sale and purchase or his
properties, the purpose and effect of a mortgage.
[27] LAD’s responses were very difficult to understand both as to content
and the level of his communication skills. He did
know that he was in receipt of
a pension but appeared to be unclear about the amount. With respect to his
parent’s property,
he said that he had lived there with his parents. He
told the Tribunal that the house sold for $180,000 and that he had a car. As
the reason for the sale, he referred to his woodturning activities making noise
but gave no other coherent reason. His response
to questions about whose idea it
was, he said that they “sort of worked it out together”. He
couldn’t remember
the price of the current property that was bought from
HM. His knowledge about a mortgage seemed to be limited to something about
and did not appear to have any understanding of the financial arrangements that
had been entered into with the mortgagee and
the number of securities that had
been given over the property. He said that he didn’t normally handle that
side of things
and didn’t keep a check of the interest rate “AR and
PK” did most of the talking and explained it to him afterwards.
displayed only a very superficial, if any real, knowledge of the nature of an
Enduring Power of Attorney. He said that “PK
explained it afterwards -
something to do with AR looking after me - sort of in charge of other
people”. When asked if AR had
appointed him as his attorney, he replied,
“Possibly”.
[28] AR gave evidence that LAD lived in his parent’s property for 25 years
by himself and did all his own grocery shopping.
He considered that LAD was
quite capable of making his own financial decisions. He told the Tribunal that
around November last year
he was going through significant medication changes
(for his epilepsy) and was “destabilising”. This might have
some people’s view of his behaviour.
[29] He said that he also believed that LAD was capable of making an Enduring
Power of Attorney. When AR was asked if he would be
prepared to similarly
appoint LAD as his attorney under an Enduring Power of Attorney he replied
confidently in the affirmative.
[30] The Tribunal enquired of AR as to the reason why a person of LAD’s
age and situation would want to sell the house he was
settled in for a long time
and incur a substantial debt to buy other properties with virtually no ability
to service the loans required.
His response centred around the former property
needing repairs, a larger area being more conducive to woodworking activities
on the benefit to LAD of increasing the value of his assets – he
claimed the current properties are now worth $610,000 with
a debt of $376,000.
AR told how “everyone is contributing” and that he is making
payments of $900 per month.
[31] On further questioning he did concede that LAD needed his help with his
financial affairs.
[32] In relation to LAD’s capacity, PK who describes herself as
LAD’s carer said that he was able to look after his finances.
denied that she had influenced him in relation to his attendance at woodworkers.
She said that this was due to work around
the house and other commitments.
[33] She did however volunteer that LAD needs help with health care decisions.
[34] PK told the Tribunal how LAD had asked her to help him buy a TV. She said
that she had to explain to him that purchasing it
on time payment would attract
interest making it much more expensive than was necessary because he had the
cash to buy it.
[35] She then also conceded that LAD also needs help with financial
[36] The applicant, EA, a social worker with the care facility, arranged
community activities for LAD. She says in her application
that she became
concerned for LAD’s financial and legal situation particularly around the
ownership of his house and mortgage
debts. She says that he has extremely poor
memory, recall and ability to manage his financial affairs. She also became
“friend” who was believed to have control over his life at present.
She said that she had serious concerns about his living situation and ‘so
called’ carer’s abuse. EA later referred
to LAD’s telling her
that he was not allowed to go to woodworkers. This had been attributed to the
people he was living with.
[37] In her evidence, EA told the Tribunal how LAD would go to the bank and
withdraw money only to return the next day and make another
withdrawal. This
would be repeated on many occasions. LAD would talk to her about financial
matters but was unable to give a reason
for these repetitive withdrawals save
that he didn’t have any money.
[38] PK volunteered as a reason for the withdrawals that LAD didn’t like
to carry lots of money around.
[39] In relation to his day to day activities, EA found him to be very confused
to perform. Tasks need to be
broken down.
[40] HJ gave evidence that he has known LAD for 14 to 15 years. Both are members
of wood workers group. He had been driving LAD to
woodworking until recently.
Over a period of 3 to 4 months this had been almost a daily occurrence at first.
He gave evidence that
at LAD’s request he would take him to the bank every
second day to withdraw money, which seemed excessive. LAD seemed confused
why he needed to go to the bank so often.
[41] This activity ceased about 2 months ago when LAD rang him to say that he
was not allowed to go down to woodworkers any more.
[42] BD, a Sergeant of Police, gave evidence that he has known LAD socially for
18 months to 2 years through their mutual interest
in woodworking. Both attend
the woodworkers group. He gave an account of their first meeting. BD was still
in his uniform at the
time and LAD seemed to be quite overawed, telling others
present that “a policeman shook his hand”. He appeared to be
- as though he thought he was in some kind of trouble. When a week or so later,
BD brought along a police colleague with
a woodworking interest (who also
happened to be in uniform) and introduced him around, LAD became quite anxious
appearing to be convinced
that he had done something wrong. This was despite BD
going to some length to correct this misapprehension.
[43] BD told the hearing how at one time LAD had expressed an interest in buying
some mechanisms for pens that they were turning
from wood. In response to
LAD’s enquiry he told him that he had 3 left and that they were $5 each.
Later he attempted to give
BD three $50 notes for the pens. Despite explanation
from BD that the total price was $15 not $150, LAD didn’t seem to
and kept pressing the overpayment.
[44] BD became aware that LAD was continually withdrawing $50 notes from the
bank. He was known to buy chips from the I..G.A. for
breakfast because he said
that he didn’t get any at home. He told the Tribunal that at one time LAD
bought a cordless drill
but was unable to give any reason for the purchase save
that he had seen it in a brochure.
The Tribunal made the following findings of
[45] LAD suffers from epilepsy and has an intellectual disability.
[46] He has substantial cognitive deficits in relation to memory, money
management and other financial matters. The discussion with
him about the
property transactions strongly supported his believing that the whole proceeds
of the sale of his parent’s house
was his. He did not appear to have a
recollection of having transferred a one-half interest in that property to AR,
nor did he appear
to have even a general knowledge of his present financial
situation. While a reason was advanced by PK for his frequent bank account
withdrawals, the evidence is that he was not able to recall making the
transactions or what he had done with the funds.
[47] While AR and NC persisted with their view that LAD was quite competent to
make financial decisions, his limitations in financial
matters were well
demonstrated by the evidence of Dr K, EA, BD and HJ. While LAD may well have
been experiencing adverse effects
from medication changes in late 2008 affecting
his behaviour at that time, the evidence establishes that his cognitive deficits
of long standing and not of a fluctuating nature. Dr K and HJ have known LAD
for a long time. BD is a person whose profession gives
him an extensive
knowledge of human behaviour, EA’s profession also gives her experience of
people with disabilities including
those of a cognitive nature. These are
knowledgeable and independent people who have had dealings with LAD and their
evidence is
unequivocal both as to his abilities now and for the time they have
known him. As it happens, AR himself had to concede that LAD
was unable to act
in financial matters without help.
[48] LAD presents as a man who has lived in the north Queensland community all
his life. His limitations would have been well known
to the community. It would
seem that he has been able to function fairly independently until recently
through the assistance of his
informal support networks.
[49] LAD is highly susceptible to the influence of others, particularly those
who he perceives as being in a position of power or
authority. This
susceptibility seriously affects LAD’s ability to make decisions on
personal and financial matters freely and
voluntarily.
[50] The sale of LAD’s parents’ property and the purchase of the
current properties involve complex financial matters.
On the evidence these
would have been beyond LAD’ ability and could not have taken place without
the significant intervention
of a third party.
[51] AR is an experienced social worker, presently undertaking work interstate.
There can be no doubt that there was an inequality
in bargaining power between
the two men both intellectually and because of the level of dependence on the
part of LAD. The evidence
is consistent with AR and PK ingratiating themselves
with LAD and of their becoming an influence on him to the extent that their
views became a predominant factor on a range of issues both personal and
financial in LAD’s life.
[52] That NC, as a solicitor acting for him, did not recognize this
vulnerability is of concern.
[53] In so far as the Enduring Power of Attorney of 16 March 2005 is concerned,
serious questions arise as to its validity.
[54] The process applied by NC would seem to fall short of the tests necessary
to satisfy the criteria referred to in section 41
Guardianship and
Administration Act 2009
and the standard referred to in the leading case on
the subject -
Ranclaud v Cabban (1988) NSW Conv.55-358
only that he understood that he was authorising someone else to look after his
affairs but also what of the sort
of things an attorney could do without
reference to him”. Implicit in this requirement is that the prospective
principal himself
has a sound understanding of his financial situation and the
decisions likely to be needed. An Enduring Power of Attorney has been
a complex legal matter –
Adult Guardian (In Re Enduring Power of
Attorney of Vera Hagger) v Vera Hagger, Declan James Barry and Albert Craig Ray
1083 of 2001(Unreported).
[55] LAD is not able to:
(a) understand the nature and effect of
complex financial matters or complex personal matters; and
(b) make decisions freely and voluntarily.
[56] Consequently LAD does not have capacity to make decisions about financial
matters or about a range of personal matters.
IS THERE A NEED FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A GUARDIAN?
The Tribunal made the following findings of fact.
[57] LAD’s personal circumstances need to be fully assessed.
[58] There is a need for decisions to be made in relation to personal matters
including the introduction and maintenance of required
services for his
wellbeing and support.
[59] In the events which have happened his personal welfare is likely to be put
at unreasonable risk, particularly in view actions
which may result from
appointments by this Tribunal.
[60] The Tribunal determines that –
(a) the need for the
appointment of a guardian has been established and
(b) appoints the Adult Guardian as guardian for all personal matters.
NEED FOR AN ADMINISTRATOR
[61] Where a person has made an Enduring Power of Attorney there would not
ordinarily be a need to appoint an administrator.
[62] AR did not present as a person of integrity. His evidence was not frank and
reliable. He was content to allow the application
to proceed on the premise that
LAD was solely entitled to the net proceeds of sale of LAD’s
parents’ property. In this
respect when AR was asked if he contributed
anything to the purchase of the current property he responded in the negative
that he was paying $900 per month for the mortgage instalments. In so
doing he sought to conceal the gift to him of a one half interest
property. The true situation only came to light in later questioning of NC about
the circumstances of the making of the will
and the Enduring Power of
[63] NC maintained that she was acting only for LAD in this gift transaction.
However she tendered a document prepared as part of
that transaction which
purported to give LAD a life interest in the property and which included a
provision that both parties have
had independent legal advice. Such a provision
would seem to be inconsistent with her stated position.
[64] LAD is considered to be a person who is easily influenced in relation to
his affairs. Despite AR’s and PK’s denial
of involvement in his
decision, LAD gave up one of his most important social activities. It was he
himself who informed his friends
of the reason why he was not attending
woodworkers. No one had any doubt as to who was in such a position of control.
That this occurred
them is considered to be more than a mere coincidence.
[65] In this case considerable doubts arise about the validity of LAD’s
Enduring Power of Attorney, although in the opinion
of the Tribunal it is not
necessary to decide this point.
[66] An important consideration however is the situation of conflict of interest
that exists on the part of the attorney due to the
nature of the financial
transactions between the two men.
[67] The financial transactions that have taken place over the past 5 years
warrant close examination in order that LAD’s interests
are protected.
This and the management of LAD’s financial affairs can only be undertaken
by an independent administrator.
The Tribunal made the following findings of fact.
[68] LAD is highly dependent on others in relation to his financial affairs.
[69] He is vulnerable to financial abuse or exploitation.
[70] LAD has complex financial affairs.
[71] There is a need for an investigation into the financial and property
transactions between LAD and AR and action to protect his
[72] AR has profited and continues to profit from his relationship with LAD. His
position of conflict of interest and the significant
issues surrounding his
previous conduct make it inappropriate for him to act in the capacity of
attorney under an Enduring Power
of Attorney.
[73] LAD’s personal and financial circumstances have changed significantly
since the Enduring Power of Attorney was made.
[74] The Tribunal determines that –
(a) pursuant to section 117
Powers of Attorney Act 1998
the Enduring Power of Attorney dated 16 March 2005 is revoked;
(b) the need for the appointment of an administrator has been established;
(c) The Public Trustee of Queensland is appointed as administrator for all
financial matters until further order.
PUBLICATION
[75] The Tribunal recognises the importance of this application and is satisfied
in accordance with section 112(5) of the Act that
it is in the public interest
that all information in relation to this matter, including the identity of all
parties in these written
reasons, be authorised for publication to the Legal
Services Commission.
