APPEARANCES:
A Thompson KC and A Nicholas (instructed by McCullough
Robertson) for the applicant
Reasons for decision
[1] On 14 May
2025, the Court delivered reasons in two competing General Applications.
applications were about whether there had been a “material change in
circumstances for the mining lease” such
as to engage
section 283B
Mineral Resources Act 1989
[3] The parties
were invited to make submissions about the form of Orders that should follow the
conclusions expressed in the reasons
by 21 May 2025.
[4] Fairhill
provided submissions asking for (1) the proceeding to be dismissed and (2) an
order that the Comiskeys pay Fairhill’s
costs (on an indemnity basis after
24 December 2024 and on a standard basis earlier than that).
Comiskeys provided no submissions.
[6] I agree with
Fairhill that the proceeding ought to be dismissed. There is no basis for the
Court to move forward under
section 283B
Mineral Resources Act
there being a “material change in circumstances for the mining
question of costs:
(a) “before costs are awarded on an indemnity basis
something more than success or failure must usually be shown. Indeed, it
usually be the case that something more than the failure to better an informal
offer must be shown. Each case must, however,
depend on its particular facts
and circumstances”: Doerr v Gardiner (No
principles with respect to orders of indemnity costs are well
decisions of the Land Appeal Court about costs orders
I also note the helpful summary
provided by Member McNamara in Hail Creek Holdings Pty Ltd & Ors v
O’Loughlin & Ors
[8] Fairhill
points to the terms of a
offer it made to the Comiskeys on 24
It further says that
costs should follow the event – and that it enjoyed success in both
General Applications.
[9] My view is
that the questions raised in the competing General Applications were
sufficiently complex that it is not possible to
conclude that the Comiskeys
acted unreasonably in rejecting the
offer. There is no other
basis for an order for indemnity costs.
[10] As for
standard costs, while the Comiskeys failed in both General Applications, my view
is that each party should bear their
own costs because:
(a) as mentioned above, the questions raised in the
competing General Applications were sufficiently complex that each side put
a viable argument in support of their position; and
(b) the Supreme
Court’s reasons complicate the assessment of Fairhill’s success.
The Supreme Court made observations
that appear to have encouraged the Comiskeys
to pursue the action in this Court. It was reasonable for the Comiskeys to
to the Supreme Court’s reasons by arguing what they did before
this Court.
[11] The orders
proceeding is dismissed.
