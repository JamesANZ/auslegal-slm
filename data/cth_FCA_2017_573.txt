me is an application made by the applicants seeking an extension of time within
which to seek leave to appeal against an order
made on 21 March 2017 dismissing
their application for preliminary discovery (see
Pfizer Ireland
Pharmaceuticals v Samsung Bioepis AU Pty Ltd
[2017] FCA 285).
In accordance
with r 35.13 of the
Federal Court Rules 2011
(Cth) (“the
FCRs”) the application for leave to appeal was required to be filed within
14 days after the order for dismissal
was made, ie. by 4 April 2017. Instead,
the present application, together with a number of affidavits in support, was
served on 10 April 2017, ie. six days, or four business days,
of the FCRs provides that an application for an extension of time must
be accompanied by:
(a) the judgment or order from which leave
to appeal is sought;
(b) the reasons for the judgment or order, if published;
(c) an affidavit stating:
(i) briefly but specifically,
the facts on which the application relies; and
(ii) why the application for leave to appeal was not filed within time;
(d) a draft notice of appeal that complies
rules 36.01(1)
(e) a statement by the applicant of whether the applicant wants to have the
application considered without oral
is not itself the source of the discretion to grant an extension of time.
So far as the FCRs are concerned, the source of the discretion
to make an order
extending time is r 1.39 which relevantly provides that the Court may
extend a time fixed by the FCRs after it has
principles governing an application for an extension of time are well settled
and not in dispute (see
Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Minister for
(1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-349 per Wilcox J and
Mehmood v Attorney-General of the Commonwealth
[2013] FCA 406
per Foster J). The considerations that are usually relevant to the exercise of
the discretion for an extension of time to apply
for leave to appeal
(a) the length of the delay;
(b) whether the applicant has provided an acceptable explanation for the
(c) whether there is any prejudice to the respondent; and
(d) the merits of the proposed application for leave to
have already described the length of the delay which was modest. The respondent
does not assert that it will suffer prejudice if
an extension of time is granted
or that the proposed appeal is untenable. Further, the parties were agreed that
this is not a case
in which it is appropriate to embark upon any more detailed
consideration of the merits of the application for leave to appeal which,
absence of any submission to the contrary, I will assume for the purposes of the
present application, is reasonably arguable

applicants’ explanation for their delay is provided in two affidavits of
Mr Silvestri, an Assistant General Counsel at Pfizer
Inc, who is based in New
York, and who at all relevant times has been responsible on behalf of the
applicants for making decisions
and giving instructions in relation to the
proceeding for preliminary discovery and, I infer, any proposed application for
to appeal the primary judge’s decision.
Silvestri’s affidavits explain that he fell ill on Saturday, 1 April 2017
and was absent from work on medical advice he received
on Sunday, 2 April 2017
until Thursday, 6 April 2017 (New York time) or Friday, 7 April 2017 (Sydney
time). The key paragraph to
Mr Silvestri’s affidavit evidence appears in
para 10 of his second affidavit in which he states (inter alia) that he
not undertake a proper analysis of the judgment or the proposed grounds of
appeal and reach a decision on behalf of the applicants
whilst he was ill, on
medication and under medical advice to stay at home. The application for an
extension of time was filed on
Monday, 10 April 2017, being the first
business day after Mr Silvestri returned to work.
basis upon which the respondent opposes the application for an extension of time
is that the applicants have not provided a full
explanation for the failure to
file the application for leave within time. The respondent submitted, in one of
two written submissions
upon which it relied, that this is a threshold
requirement for the grant of an extension of time within which to file an
application
for leave to appeal.
respondent’s submission does not reflect the language of the FCRs or the
effect of the relevant authorities and Mr Catterns
QC, who appeared for the
respondent, was right to acknowledge as much in his oral submissions. The
discretion arising under r 1.39
to grant an extension of time is a broad
one that is constrained only by the purpose for which it is conferred –
relieve against injustice – and the requirement that it be
exercised judicially (see
Skinner v Commonwealth of Australia
per Flick J,
Gallo v Dawson
[1990] HCA 30
(1990) 93 ALR 479
McHugh J and
FAI General Insurance Company Limited v Southern Cross
Exploration NL
[1988] HCA 13
(1988) 165 CLR 268
at 283-284 per Wilson J).
my opinion, Mr Silvestri’s affidavits meet the requirements of
r 35.14(3) in that they state why the application for leave
to appeal was
not filed within time.
Rule 35.14(3)
does not require, expressly or
impliedly, that the accompanying affidavit contain a “full
explanation” of the delay.
The extent to which an applicant for leave
must explain its delay will depend on the circumstances of the case. A lengthy
may call for a much more detailed explanation than a modest delay such as
occurred in this case. Further, there is nothing to preclude
a court granting
an extension of time even if it considers the explanation for the delay is
unsatisfactory if other considerations
relevant to the exercise of the
discretion to grant an extension of time favour the making of such an order.
respondent submitted that Mr Silvestri’s evidence does not explain what,
if any, steps were taken on behalf of the applicants
with respect to any
proposed application for leave to appeal before Mr Silvestri fell ill. This
submission is correct so far as
it goes. However, accepting that Mr
Silvestri’s explanation for the delay is not as detailed or comprehensive
as it might
have been, and that Mr Silvestri has not explained what
consideration, if any, was given to the matter before he fell ill, the question
that remains is whether, having regard to this and all other relevant
considerations, the interests of justice favour the granting
of the short
extension of time that is sought. In all the circumstances, including the
modest duration of the delay, I think an
extension of time should be granted.
time for the applicants to file an application for leave to appeal will be
extended to 10 April 2017. The costs of the application
for an extension
of time are to be costs in the application for leave to appeal or, if leave to
appeal is granted, in the appeal.
accordingly.
