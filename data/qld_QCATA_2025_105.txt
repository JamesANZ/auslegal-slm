APPEARANCES & REPRESENTATION:
This matter was heard and determined on the papers pursuant to
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act

M Dzienis, HUB Community Legal
REASONS FOR DECISION
appeal raises an important question about the Tribunal’s jurisdiction,
namely whether it can hear and decide bailment
claims in the absence of a
contractual relationship between the parties. Curiously, that question was not
raised by the parties in
the Tribunal below. Nor has it been proffered as a
ground of appeal. Nevertheless, it is a question that this Appeal Tribunal is
compelled to consider.
[2] Anthony
Kartadinata (‘applicant’) appeals against the decision of an
Adjudicator sitting in the Tribunal’s minor
civil disputes jurisdiction to
award damages to Abdulhamid Siraj (‘respondent’).
applicant owns a motor vehicle repair business that trades under the business
name ‘Oxley Car Repairs and Service Centre’.
respondent owns a 2018 Nissan Navara utility (‘vehicle’).
February 2022, the respondent delivered his vehicle to the applicant’s
workshop which is located at Blunder Rd, Oxley
(‘workshop’).
[6] At some
point between 25 February 2022 and 26 February 2022, the respondent’s car
was destroyed when heavy rains caused
the workshop to flood.
respondent brought a minor civil dispute claim which proceeded to a hearing on 6
November 2023.
Respondent’s contentions in the Tribunal
Tribunal below the respondent, through his solicitor, contended that a
gratuitous bailment arose when the respondent delivered
his vehicle to the
applicant’s workshop. The respondent submitted that there was intense
rainfall in the days preceding the
flooding, combined with severe weather
warnings for intense upcoming rainfall and major flood warnings for upper
Brisbane issued
on Friday 25 February 2022.
respondent contended that a reasonable trader in the applicant’s location
would have closely monitored the ongoing severe
weather conditions and
forecasts. He argued that the applicant should have:
(a) informed the respondent about the impending flooding and requested that he
collect the vehicle.
(b) relocated the vehicle to higher ground to avert damage.
(c) secured a suitable insurance policy to cover vehicles under his care.
respondent also contended that the applicant breached statutory guarantees under
the Australian consumer law, namely:
(a) the failure to exercise due care and skill under
Consumer Law
(‘ACL’); and
(b) the failure to supply service within reasonable time under
Applicant’s submissions in the Tribunal below
an affidavit filed in the Tribunal below, the applicant deposed:
(a) on or about 23 February 2022, the respondent brought the vehicle to his
(b) the respondent told him that the vehicle’s Check Engine Light
(‘CEL’) was illuminated. The applicant was busy
with bookings, but
he promised to call the respondent when he had time to check the CEL.
(c) the applicant did not provide the respondent with a quotation because he did
not know what was wrong with the vehicle.
(d) although it had been raining for over a week at the time, the applicant had
no indication or warning about flooding in the Oxley
(e) on Friday 25 February 2022, at 6pm, the applicant shut his workshop and left
for home. The roads were all clear and he had not
received any warnings or
indications of any possible flooding in the area.
(f) the next morning, when the applicant attempted to return to his shop the
roads were blocked, and it had started flooding.
(g) the applicant was unable to contact his customers because their details were
in his workshop book, which was located at the workshop.
(h) the applicant was unable to access his shop until Wednesday 2 March 2022.
(i) at the time of the flooding the applicant had several of his own vehicles at
his workshop.
[12] In written
submissions to the Tribunal below the applicant submitted:
(a) while negligence involves a failure to take reasonable care to address
risks, it does not require a person to take action against
every risk that could
possibly arise.
(b) the risk of harm was not foreseeable. The Brisbane City Council Floodwise
Report indicated that the probability of a flood of
the same magnitude as the
one the that occurred was between 1%-2% for 62 Blunder Road, Oxley, Queensland.
(c) a flood of a similar magnitude had not occurred in the previous ten years
and only once before in the previous 15 years.
(d) there was no water pooling near the workshop, nor was there any warning from
the Brisbane City Council that the suburb could
respondent gave viva voce evidence at the hearing which was consistent with his
written material above.
The applicant’s grounds of appeal
applicant’s ‘Application for leave to appeal or appeal’
advances nine ‘claims’. It contains
some duplication and I have been
only able to discern five unique grounds of appeal.
applicant’s first ground of appeal contends that the Tribunal below denied
the applicant procedural fairness because
it refused his application for legal
representation but granted the respondent’s application for legal
representation.
[16] Following
is a short chronology of relevant interlocutory events concerning the grant of
legal representation:
(a) On 14 June 2023, the respondent filed in the Tribunal an application for
leave to be legally represented.
(b) On 21 August 2023, the respondent filed submissions in support of his
application for leave to be legally represented.
(c) On 22 August 2023, Member Scott-Mackenzie made an order granting the parties
“leave to be legally represented in the proceeding”
and required
them to file and serve on each other “submissions on the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal to hear and decide the proceeding”.
(d) On 28 September 2023, Adjudicator Adcock made directions, inter alia:
(i) granting the respondent leave to be legally represented at the hearing.
(ii) requiring the applicant to submit a Form 56 within 14 days of his order if
they sought leave to be legally represented.
(iii) listing the matter for hearing.
(e) On 2 November 2023, the applicant applied for legal representation. That
same day, Adjudicator Adcock denied the applicant leave
to be legally
represented. The Tribunal below did not provide written reasons for its
applicant contends that he is a mechanic who does not have a legal background.
Accordingly, the applicant argues that he
was required, for the first time, to
curate legal arguments in response to a claim for breach of bailment. The
applicant submits
that for a lay person, defending an action for negligence in
relation to a bailment is a complex issue, and the Tribunal’s
grant leave amounted to a breach of the rules of natural justice.
applicant’s second ground of appeal is that the learned adjudicator did
not give him any direction about the evidence
required to discharge the reverse
onus of proof inherent to a bailment claim. In conjunction with the
Tribunal’s refusal to
grant the applicant legal representation, the
applicant submits that the failure to give directions amounted to a denial of
applicant contends that the Tribunal below did not apply the correct legal test
when determining the standard of care the
defendant ought to have exercised. He
submits that the test the learned adjudicator applied was “what reasonable
a business owner of a mechanic shop take in storing the
vehicles”. It submits that the test that the learned adjudicator should
have applied was “did the Applicant take the level of reasonable care with
the respondent’s vehicle which they would
have taken in respect of their
own vehicle”.
applicant points out that the applicant left several of his own vehicles at the
shop. Accordingly, the applicant submits
that he took the same level of care
with the respondent’s vehicle as he did with his own.
applicant contends that the Tribunal failed to make findings about the
(a) when the applicant should have warned the respondent to collect his vehicle.
(b) whether such a warning would have avoided the loss or damage to the
respondent’s vehicle.
[22] Without
making findings about such matters, the applicant contends that the learned
adjudicator was not entitled to conclude
that the applicant’s conduct
damaged the respondent’s vehicle.
[23] Lastly,
the applicant contends that the Tribunal below failed to consider material
evidence (the Floodwise Report) before making
its decision. The applicant
contends the report was not on the Tribunal file at the hearing and therefore
the learned adjudicator
could not have considered it when handing down her
applicant submits the report is relevant to deciding the questions of reasonable
foreseeability and whether the applicant
took reasonable care.
Appeal Tribunal’s consideration
[25] This is an
appeal from a minor civil dispute proceeding. Therefore, the applicant is
required to obtain the Tribunal’s
Leave may be granted where:
(a) there is an important point of law or question of general public
importance.
(b) where an appeal is necessary to correct a substantial injustice to the
applicant and there is a reasonable argument that there
is an error to be
[26] For reasons
that I will elaborate on below, I have resolved that Appeal Tribunal ought to
grant the applicant leave to appeal
to correct the following legal
(a) the Tribunal below lacked jurisdiction to decide a bailment claim because
the parties had not entered a legally binding contract.
(b) at the hearing, the Tribunal below denied the applicant natural justice by
failing to offer him an adjournment to engage legal
representatives.
[27] Neither the
parties nor the Tribunal below considered the question of jurisdiction at first
instance, nor did they raise it on
appeal. Nevertheless, “there is a
fundamental obligation on any court or tribunal to satisfy itself as to
being asked to quell controversies that come before
Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear minor civil disputes is enlivened by
Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2009
(‘QCAT Act’). It relevantly provides that the Tribunal may exercise
its jurisdiction for a minor civil dispute
if a relevant person has under the
QCAT Act, applied to the tribunal to deal with the dispute.
[29] Relevantly,
a ‘relevant person’ means “for a claim arising out of a
contract between a consumer and trader
‘consumer’, for services, means an individual for whom services are
supplied for fee or reward
(my emphasis) other than –
(a) in a trade or business carried on by the individual; or
(b) as a member of a business partnership.
[31] Schedule 3
of the QCAT Act defines the ‘term minor civil dispute’ as follows:
minor civil dispute—
1 Minor civil dispute means—
(a) a claim to recover a debt or liquidated demand of money of up to the
prescribed amount; or
(b) a claim arising out of a contract between a consumer and trader, or a
contract between 2 or more traders, that is—
(i) for payment of money of a value not more than the prescribed amount; or
(ii) for relief from payment of money of a value not more than the prescribed
(iii) for performance of work of a value not more than the prescribed amount to
rectify a defect in goods supplied or services provided;
(iv) for return of goods of a value not more than the prescribed amount; or
(v) for a combination of any 2 or more claims mentioned in subparagraphs (i) to
(iv) where the total value of the combined claim
is not more than the prescribed
(c) a claim for an amount of not more than the prescribed amount for damage to
property caused by, or arising out of the use of,
a vehicle; or
(d) a tenancy matter; or
(e) a claim that is the subject of a dispute under the
Neighbourhood Disputes
(Dividing Fences and Trees) Act 2011
, chapter 2 and is for an amount not
more than the prescribed amount; or
(f) a matter in relation to which a person may, under the
Building Act 1975
apply to the tribunal for an order.
of the above definition bears any relevance to the present appeal.
[33] Importantly,
pursuant to the above definition, a dispute is only a ‘minor civil
dispute’ if there is a ‘claim
arising out of a contract between a
consumer and trader’.
[34] Here, there
was no such contract. It is not in contest that the applicant did not provide
the respondent with a quotation because
he intended to inspect the vehicle

essential term is not agreed.
is an essential term.
respondent himself deposes
he told the applicant the red warning light in the vehicle was illuminated, to
which the applicant replied “no worry,
I will check your car. Please leave
the key in the car and I will check it. After completing the inspection,
I’ll let you know”,
or words to that effect. Those words the
applicant uttered are noncommittal. He evinces no firm intention to enter a
binding contract.
The applicant makes no promise beyond agreeing to inspect the
vehicle to determine what repairs were required. Acceptance of a contract
be unequivocal.
Upon inspecting
the vehicle, it remained open to the applicant to decline to perform the work.
Conversely, if the respondent took
umbrage with the price of the quotation, or
the scope of the repairs, or the time it might take to complete the repairs, it
to him to decline the quotation.
Booker Industries Pty Ltd v Wilson Parking (Qld) Pty
the High Court said,
“the courts will not lend their aid to the enforcement of an incomplete
agreement, being no more than
an agreement of the parties to agree at some time
in future”. Similarly, in
Toyota Motor
Corp Australia Ltd v Ken Morgan Motors Pty
it was held that a
contract is incomplete if the parties have deliberately left some future term to
be settled by future agreement.
Here the applicant and respondent had not agreed
on price, the scope of the proposed work or the time for completion. Therefore,
any proposed agreement between them was incomplete and unenforceable.
corollary to the above, if no contract existed, the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction
to hear the claim in its minor civil dispute
applicant’s appeal must succeed.
[38] I have
considered whether the arrangement for the applicant to examine the vehicle
amounted to a ‘collateral contract’,
that is a contract the
consideration for which is entry into another contract. I ultimately concluded
that the arrangement was not
a collateral contract, as no consideration flowed
to the applicant even if he successfully completed his side of the bargain.
was no guarantee that respondent would give the applicant the job after
receiving a quotation. Neither party lead any evidence to
suggest the applicant
would be renumerated for merely examining the vehicle.
[39] Further, I
am not satisfied the respondent is a ‘relevant person’ who is
entitled to apply to the Tribunal to deal
with the dispute. Section 12(4)(b) of
the QCAT Act provides that a relevant person for a claim arising a contract
between a consumer
and trader is a ‘consumer’. The QCAT Act
relevantly defines a consumer to mean an individual to whom services are
for fee or reward. Here, the applicant did not supply services for fee
or reward. He merely promised to examine the vehicle and provide
a quotation. If
I am correct in my assessment that the respondent is not a relevant person to
bring a claim in the Tribunal’s
minor civil dispute jurisdiction, the
applicant’s appeal must succeed.
Procedural fairness and
natural justice
[40] Turning now
to the applicant’s contention that the Tribunal denied the applicant
procedural fairness. Ordinarily, there
is no obligation on a Tribunal to ensure
that party has legal representation, and the absence of legal representation is
not a denial
of procedural
[41] However,
the parties in this appeal have proceeded on the basis that the Tribunal below
refused the applicant leave to be legally
represented in the proceeding. They
are wrong. On 22 August 2023, Member Scott-Mackenzie made an order granting the
parties “leave
to be legally represented in the proceeding” and
required them to file and serve on each other “submissions on the
of the Tribunal to hear and decide the proceeding”. The
Tribunal’s subsequent order refusing to grant the applicant legal
representation on 2 November 2023, was therefore a nullity.
[42] Moreover,
at the hearing, the Tribunal below did not interrogate its previous orders with
sufficient thoroughness to ascertain
whether the applicant had been granted
legal representation. Because of that omission the applicant, who had no legal
training, was
subjected to the invidious task of mounting a rational and
cohesive defence to a bailment argument conceived and argued by a qualified
lawyer. Unsurprisingly, he failed in that endeavour.
[43] As J R S
Forbes aptly points out in his seminal text ‘Justice in
Tribunals’:
Natural justice makes two
before a person’s
legal rights are adversely affected, or their “legitimate
expectations” are dashed: (1) an opportunity
to show why adverse action
should not be taken (
audi alteram partem
or the “hearing
rule”), a sufficient opportunity to say everything that can be said in his
Italiano v Carbone &
a case where a ground
of appeal contended by the appellant involved a failure by the Consumer Trader
and Tenancy Tribunal (‘CTTT’)
to grant an adjournment, Basten JA
relevantly said:
[85] A claim based on procedural fairness, in these circumstances, must
demonstrate that the confusion in the mind of the Claimant
was such that he
cannot be said to have foregone a reasonable opportunity to make an application
for an adjournment, or the circumstances
were such that the Tribunal itself had
an obligation to consider offering an adjournment.
[45] Here, the
circumstances warranted the Tribunal below offering the applicant an adjournment
to exercise his earlier conferred
right to have a legal representative present.
By failing to offer the applicant an adjournment, the Tribunal perpetuated the
power imbalance between the parties and rendered nugatory the
applicant’s capacity to meaningfully respond to the respondent’s
case. The fact that neither the respondent’s lawyer, or the adjudicator,
or the applicant’s lawyer in the appeal, turned
their minds to the
question of jurisdiction, reinforces my conviction that the applicant ought to
have been afforded the opportunity
to be legally represented in the Tribunal
[46] I reject
the respondent’s submission that the applicant had the opportunity to
appeal Adjudicator Adcock’s decision
to refuse legal representation but
failed to do so. The applicant was plainly unaware that the Tribunal had already
granted him leave
to be legally represented. At the hearing, the Tribunal below
had duty to address that
misunderstanding.
Its failure to
do so amounts to a denial of natural justice. I would therefore grant the
applicant leave to appeal and allow the
appeal, as the “denial of natural
justice is an error of law
deprives a tribunal of jurisdiction and nullifies its
[47] I do not
propose to address grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal, as they are somewhat overtaken
by my findings above, however I will
consider grounds 3, 4 and 5 for
completeness.
[48] Concerning
ground 3, I am not persuaded that the learned adjudicator did not apply the
correct legal test when determining the
standard of care the applicant ought to
have exercised. The applicant’s submission that he left several of his own
at the shop is misguided. The test of reasonableness is primarily
objective rather than
subjective.
As J Palmer aptly
points out in ‘Palmer on
probably, in general terms, no significant difference between the care which a
reasonable and prudent man normally
bestows on his own goods and that which he
normally bestows on goods belonging to another”.
my view, it was unnecessary for the Tribunal to make an explicit finding about
the precise time the applicant should have
warned the respondent to collect his
vehicle, and whether such a warning would have averted loss. In his affidavit,
the applicant
deposed that the flooding took place between 6pm on Friday 25
February 2022 and Saturday 26 February
The respondent
particularised the applicant’s negligence to include the failure to
closely monitor ongoing severe weather conditions
and forecasts and take
measures to safeguard the vehicle. It can be inferred that learned Adjudicator
must have concluded that the
applicant should have taken such measures before
leaving his shop on Friday.
is no substance to the applicant’s claim that the learned adjudicator did
not consider the Floodwise Report. The
respondent filed the report in in the
Tribunal registry on 25 October
The report was brought to
the learned adjudicator’s attention during the
