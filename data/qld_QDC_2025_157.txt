Porter KC DCJ
Application dismissed.
applicant plaintiff seeks orders for substituted service on the defendant.
applicant submits that it is impracticable to serve the defendant personally and
that service has a high probability of success
if served on two addresses and an
email address associated with him.
applicant has caused process servers to attempt service at the following
(a) An address in Russell Street believed to be the defendant’s
(b) An address in Relentless Court believed to be a place of business he
utilises; and
(c) An address of a property in Sunnybank of which the defendant is the
registered proprietor.
[4] As to the
first, the Russell Street address is given as an address for service under the
Lease between the parties. There is
also evidence on current ASIC searches
showing Russell Street to be the defendant’s residence. Further, a person
at the Relentless
Court address (who also confirmed the defendant owned a
business operating there) said he lives in a unit in Russell Street. It
likely that address remains his home. There have only been three attempts at
service at Russell Street in mid-September (mid-morning
and early evening) and
those have not produced any evidence that the defendant was home at those times.
Some people go on holidays.
Some people work long hours.
Relentless Court address was provided by a commercial real estate agency
employee, along with an email and mobile number.
There was no context provided
in the evidence as to the currency of that information. However, the process
server who attempted
service there on three occasions, was informed on two
occasions that the defendant was the owner of the business run from there but
that he was rarely there.
plaintiff also caused attempted service on the Sunnybank address but was told by
a person on site that the property was being
sold and neither he nor the
neighbours spoken to said they knew the defendant. The process server was
informed that the agent was
Ray White. Messages were left with an agent
seemingly of Ray White Sunnybank, though there was no evidence she was involved
the sale nor that the agency involved was the Sunnybank officer of Ray
White (though it was probably a reasonable guess). The agent
has not returned
the calls of the process server.
plaintiff also sent an email to the address provided by Lasalles. They received
a notification it had been opened, though
no response has been received and
there was no evidence of the defendant sending an email from that email
[8] Attempts
were made to call the mobile number provided by Lasalles, though no response has
been received and there is no evidence
of the defendant responding to or using
that number.
[9] The evidence
relied upon is mostly admissible, though strictly speaking the process
servers’ evidence of hearsay statements
is not sworn in proper information
and belief form, nor arguably is the evidence of the Lasalles
instructions.
[10] Putting
that to one side, however, I turn to the threshold question of impracticability.
One of the problems with the plaintiff’s
evidence is that there is no
evidence that the defendant is at his likely residence, nor has he recently been
at his apparent business
premises. There is a lack of evidence of his presence
at all. He might be keeping house, but it is just as likely he is on holidays,
away on business, or was just not at home on the very few (three only) occasions
that efforts were made to serve him, or that he
has moved from that
[11] The only
material basis for the submission that he is avoiding service is the lack of
response to the email sent to the Lasalles
email address and the calls to the
Lasalles mobile. However, I have already observed that there is no recent
evidence of the defendant
continuing to use that email or mobile. I do not
put weight on the lack of the response from the agent for the reasons already
[12] In the
light of those matters, I accept it is presently impracticable to serve the
defendant personally but not because I am
satisfied that he is avoiding service.
Rather, it seems to me that the plaintiff just does not know where the defendant
(with a high level of assurance) to contact him.
impracticability might formally be made out in the circumstance, the difficulty
arises with making an order for substituted
service. A Court must have a high
level of assurance that substituted service orders will bring a proceeding to
the attention of
the defendant. I am not satisfied that service on Russell
Street or the email address will “in all reasonable probability,
certainty, be effective to bring knowledge of the proceedings to the
defendant”,
certainly not
within any reasonable time frame. Service on the property of which he is
registered proprietor is also uncertain.
I have no evidence that the house or
its mailbox is supervised by anyone associated with the defendant. Again, such
service might
work, but I am not persuaded on the evidence that it will.
[14] Whether
Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999
(Qld), service under a
contract, is available on the proper construction of the relevant provisions of
the lease is another matter,
but not a matter before me on this
application.
[15] As Judge
Cash explained in
Sunshine Phone Systems (in liq) v Martens and
[2021] QDC 36
, substituted service orders should not be made
lightly. The effect of a substituted service order is that the documents are
to have been served using indirect means after a certain period. Often,
this provides a foundation for serious consequences in the
form of a default
If the proceedings have
not in fact been brought to the attention of the defendant, there is an
increased possibility of injustice.
Where it comes to light that a successful
application was deficient, the task of setting aside default judgment imposes
unnecessary
pressure, expense and difficulty upon the courts and the parties,
particularly as most respondents in these applications are self-represented.
[16] While the
application was reasonably brought, I am not persuaded that the order should be
made on the present evidence. I dismiss
application.
