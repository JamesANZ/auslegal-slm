COOK, Courtney Liza - Inquest Number 05/2021 (0809/2019), Responses [2022] SACorCResp 2 (13 April 2022)
Cook, Courtney Liza (Coroner Schapel)
Recommendation 1
- Received into evidence were a number of documentary
exhibits that include a revised Management of Paracetamol Poisoning protocol
other documentation that relates to the tracking of blood test results. In
addition, the statement dated 26 July 2021 of Dr
Peak Mann Mah who is an
endocrinologist and general physician at the NALHN, sets out certain changes and
measures that have been
implemented in relation to the handover of patients
between shifts, the recognition of deteriorating patients, the review of
with significant ingestion of medications and the education of staff.
A joint education session between the LMH ED and Medicine
Toxicology had been
scheduled to occur in 2020 to discuss matters that became evident from
Ms Cook’s death. However, this
session had been cancelled due to
Covid restrictions and demands on medical staff. If this education session has
yet to occur, I
would urge that it takes place at the earliest opportunity
following the delivery of these findings.
Response from SA Health

recommended by the Coroner and will contribute to
a system-wide approach to
reviewing Paracetamol Overdose protocols.
planned a Grand Round presentation booked for 9 November 2022, which includes
teleconference facilities between sites. This
session is to include Paracetamol
poisoning, protocol/clinical procedure (referencing NALHN and National
Guidelines), tracking and
following up of blood results, clinical handover, and
escalation of care.
The Department
for Health and Wellbeing (The Department) will work with Local Health Networks
(LHNs) to determine a consistent system-wide
multi-disciplinary approach to
clinical education sessions relating to the safe management of patients
presenting with Paracetamol
Recommendation 2
– The revised Management of Paracetamol Poisoning protocol alters the
protocol as it existed at the time of Ms Cook’s
presentation to the LMH in
that it expands the concept of ‘unknown’ time of ingestion to
encompass an ‘uncertain
or unreliable history’ in respect of time of
ingestion. Secondly, it speaks of a low threshold for commencing NAC in
with ingestion of 10 grams of paracetamol or more. However, from what
can be seen of the revised protocol, it does not provide any
further guidance as
to what should take place in the case of an anorexic or bulimic patient who has
ingested that quantity. In my
view the relevance of anorexia or bulimia and
their possible effect on glutathione depletion should be spelt out in the
Further guidance should be included to explain the necessary course
of action when such a patient is encountered. I so

Response from SA Health
Metropolitan
hospitals adhere to the protocols that exist with their site-specific
guidelines, including appropriate treatment of
patients presenting with
anorexia/ bulimia. The Rural Support Service (RSS) are developing a new
guideline for Regional hospitals.
The Department
has recommended LHNs review current Paracetamol Overdose clinical guidelines,
local procedures, and protocols to include
management of patients presenting
with 'unknown time of ingestion', 'uncertain or unreliable history' with respect
to time of ingestion
and anorexic/bulimic patients presenting with Paracetamol
The Department
will work with LHNs to determine a consistent system-wide multidisciplinary
approach to review Paracetamol Overdose
protocols and implement procedure
Recommendation 3
- The revised protocol does not
appear to emphasise the importance of blood testing for evidence of liver damage
in cases where NAC
is not administered. Clearly, such blood testing is
necessary in all cases, but it is particularly important in cases where NAC
not given for whatever reason. Illustrating this of course is the fact that in
Ms Cook’s case, timely blood testing would
have dictated the
administration of a NAC infusion notwithstanding that it was not ordered in the
first instance. I so
. I direct this
recommendation
the Chief Executive of SA Health.
Response from SA Health
The Department
has recommended LHNs review current clinical guidelines, local procedures, and
protocols to emphasize the importance
of blood testing for evidence of liver
damage in cases where NAG is not administered.

will work with LHNs to determine a consistent system-wide multidisciplinary
approach to review Paracetamol Overdose
protocols and implement procedure
Recommendation 4
- In her final submission, Ms Giles
of counsel assisting suggested that all local health networks in South Australia
should implement
a policy whereby any patient with a known or suspected
paracetamol overdose must have a blood test to measure blood paracetamol
concentration
at four hours post admission to a hospital. She suggested that
this should take place in addition to blood taken at what is reported
hours post ingestion, regardless of the reported ingestion time and the apparent
reliability of that information. Ms
Giles submits that a mandated blood test at
four hours post admission in addition to the bloods taken four hours post
believed time
of ingestion, would allow for a comparison to be made between the
levels and should leave no room for error. It would serve as something
failsafe measure that might capture cases of paracetamol toxicity in which NAC
has not been administered due to an incorrect
ingestion time. Mr Ambrose on
behalf of the NALHN submitted to the Court that he and his client had no
difficulty with this sensible
recommendation. I agree with those submissions
accordingly. In my view the implementation of that
recommendation should be undertaken more broadly than just within NALHN. It
seems to me that it ought to have universal application across all public health
networks. I therefore direct this
recommendation
to the attention of the
Chief Executive of SA Health.
Recommendation 5
- Ms Giles also submitted that an appropriate
recommendation would be that blood tests for liver function should be mandated
hours post admission in all cases of reported or suspected paracetamol
overdose in excess of 10 grams regardless of the reported
ingestion time and
regardless of whether there has been a need to administer a NAC infusion. On
behalf of NALHN, Mr Ambrose also
agreed with this submission. I agree with
those submissions and
accordingly. In my view the
implementation of that recommendation should be undertaken more broadly than
just within NALHN. It
seems to me that it ought to have universal application
across all public health networks. I therefore direct this
recommendation
to the attention of the Chief Executive of SA Health.
Response from SA Health
The recommendations will be considered, and this SA Health report
incorporates the responses of the relevant statewide services.
The Department
has recommended LHNs review current Paracetamol Overdose clinical guidelines,
local procedures, and protocols to consider
the inclusion of the requirement for
blood testing of liver function at 24 hours post admission in all cases of
reported or suspected
ingestion in excess of 10gms of paracetamol.
The Department
will work with LHNs to determine a consistent system-wide multidisciplinary
approach to review Paracetamol Overdose
protocols and implement procedure
