REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
is an application for a lot entitlement alteration under s 48 of the
Corporate and Community Titles Act 1997
(“the BCCM Act”).
is bought by two of lot owners in an inner-city building which contains widely
ranging types of lot. Some are commercial and others
residential. Some are large
and some are small.
material consists of expert reports to which I will refer to respectively as
"the Linkhorn report” and “the SSKB report”.
partial reconciliation of those reports prepared by the respective experts after
conferring as directed by the tribunal.
The material also includes various
responses from lot owners who would be affected by any adjustment to the lot
entitlements.
body corporate is the only respondent to these proceedings, but the persons
affected by the decision will be the various lot owners,
each of whom
individually stands to suffer a substantial detriment or obtain a substantial
benefit from this litigation. The Tribunal’s
determination will
necessarily impact differentially on various groups of lot owners within the
complex. In this situation they
are the persons truly and directly affected by
the litigation. However they have not been made respondents and as I read the
Act they cannot be made respondents.
48(2) of the BCCM Act provides-
“Despite any other law or statutory instrument, a
respondent to an application mentioned in subsection (1) is the body
corporate”.
provision is made in Ss 48(3) and 48(4) for the joinder of lot owners as
respondents when the proceedings are before an adjudicator,
but there is no such
provision for proceedings in this Tribunal. This seems deliberate, and to have
been designed to avoid proliferation
of proceedings and the complexities of
having multiple respondents. Plainly the body corporate is intended to be the
sole respondent
in such matters, and as such is a class representative which
must do its best to represent all lot members. The problem is that the
of the lot members in such proceedings are almost inevitably at odds with one
the lot owners may not be formal parties their views deserve to be known. This
can be achieved by Tribunal directions that require
the body corporate to
provide all affected lot owners with relevant material and to transmit all
relevant responses back to the tribunal.
Responsible bodies corporate choose to
do this in any event as they are anxious to ensure that all lot owners are kept
informed and
that any relevant views of minority groups or members are
transmitted. I note that this has so far been done voluntarily by the body
corporate in the present proceedings.
are however some aspects of the present exercise that cause concern.
Linkhorn Report”
which was supplied to the Tribunal (and
also apparently to the unit holders) is incomplete. Documents which are said to
be attached
in paragraphs 7.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.9, 8.10, 8.11, 8.12, 8.14, 8.15, 8.17
and 9.4 are missing. Proper appraisal of the document without
these attachments
is difficult if not impossible. It will be necessary for a complete copy of the
report to be supplied to the Tribunal
and to the affected lot owners.
“SSKB Report
” dated 30 July 2009 does not appear to have yet
been distributed to the various lot owners. That report was obtained by the
body corporate after it received submissions from lot owners who opposed the
recommendations in the
“Linkhorn Report”.
It was obtained
with the support of at least some of the disaffected lot owners who were unhappy
with the Linkhorn report.
However the
“SSKB Report”
in some respects even more unfavourable to the interests of a number of these
lot owners, and I think that they should be allowed
and be given the opportunity to make further submissions on it
or if thought fit to present the body corporate with material contradicting
before the relevant issues are decided.
consider that this is not yet a matter that can be decided satisfactorily on the
papers, and that further steps will need to be
taken. As a first step in
complying with the directions given hereunder I suggest that the body corporate
may contact the solicitors
who have so far acted for individual lot owners and
ascertain if they will act as a point of communication between the body
and those clients.
application is adjourned for determination to a date to be fixed.
respondent will provide all lot owners in “The Residences CTS 27131”
with complete copies of the Linkhorn and SSKB
reports by 4:00pm on 6 November
2009, under cover of a letter advising them that they may make further
submissions and provide further
relevant material to the body corporate by,
4:00pm on 4 December 2009.
respondent will file in the registry two copies and deliver to the
applicants’ one copy of all such material as is received
in response,
along with any further material on which it wishes to rely by, 4:00pm on 18
December 2009.
