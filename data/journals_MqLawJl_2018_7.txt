The report of the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) into elder abuse

recommendations of the ALRC. This will be done with particular

measures already taken by Legal Aid ACT to address elder abuse in the Australian

this context
the paper will argue that we need to move towards a more
rights-based dialogue, taking into account the views expressed by an elderly
person, when examining how the risk factors of elder abuse must be woven into an
appropriate legal assistance strategy.
II UNDERSTANDING THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ELDER ABUSE
IN THE COMMUNITY
It is useful to set out the current situation regarding elder abuse in the
ACT to understand the difficulties that may be present
in responding to elder
abuse. As of the 2016 Census, there were 49,969 people over the age of 65 living
in the ACT,
with 6,158 of these
being persons over the age of 85.
The ACT, like the rest of the country, is an ageing jurisdiction, with the
percentage of elderly people in the territory having increased
from 8.6% in 2001
to 12.6% in 2016, the second largest increase in the nation behind Tasmania over
Despite the rapidly ageing population in the ACT, little is known about the
incidence of elder abuse in the jurisdiction. A 2015 Council
of the Ageing ACT
report noted the true incidence of elder abuse in the Territory was
‘unknown’, primarily due to the
difficulty collecting information
and the vulnerability of victims of elder
However, one
‘concrete’ figure has been recorded by the Australian National
University (ANU) in 2011. While conducting
a survey in relation to the status of
Canberra as an ‘age-friendly city’, the ANU found 6.1% of elderly
people in the
ACT had experienced a form of elder abuse, whether financial,
psychological, physical or
This figure is in line
with the 2015 estimate by the World Health Organisation (WHO) noting 2.2% to 14%
of elderly people in middle
to high income nations have experienced some form of
elder abuse.
Still, these figures
are likely a conservative estimate given the difficulty in collecting
information regarding elder abuse. The
difficulty has often been attributed to
the fact an elderly person may not recognise certain behaviour as abuse, or they
may be reluctant
to report a close friend or family member for fear of reprisal,
destroying the relationship or losing the care they require, thereby
the numbers reported.
As more people are required to access healthcare services or rely on their
children or family members for everyday care, they are
also placed at a greater
risk of suffering from elder abuse. This is not to say that every arrangement
made, whether it is to place
an elderly person into an aged care facility or to
execute an ‘assets for care’
will result in elder
abuse. However, such arrangements increase the dependence of the elderly person
on their caregiver, elevating
the risk of
Arguably elder abuse will
become more prevalent in the ACT, and indeed the country in general, as the
population ages and more people
become dependent on others for financial or
health care.
Current Service Challenges in Addressing Elder
Abuse in the ACT

should be at the
forefront of putting in place mechanisms to ensure elder abuse is appropriately
managed. However, while there have
certainly been positive responses such as the
ACT Elder Abuse Prevention Program

disjointed and in need of greater exposure to the wider public. For instance,
the Older Persons’ Abuse Prevention
Referral and Information Line which
was initially established in 2004, received only 125 calls in 2016-17 from
people seeking information
or advice about elder
At Legal Aid ACT there
are proxy indicators for identifying elder abuse matters, such as statistics
indicating the age of clients
assisted and the presence of family violence. In
2016, 17,560 services to clients over the age of 65 were
These numbers, assuming the estimates of abuse in the ACT are correct,
indicate that there is a much larger and hidden unmet need
in the ACT for senior
legal services addressing elder abuse. Additionally, Legal Aid ACT along with
the other community legal services
in the ACT are only able to provide
preliminary advice on complex matters (such as wills or contractual arrangements
involving equitable
interests). This is problematic, as misfeasance in these
areas of law can sometimes be an indication of elder abuse, particularly
financial abuse, further illustrating the difficulty of meeting the legal needs
of an ageing ACT population.
These statistics are further compounded by the fact that social isolation may
be a predictor of abuse.
must be a primary consideration in recalibrating service delivery, particularly
in a jurisdiction such as the ACT where a high
average income coupled with
policies that have spread public housing across the Territory, known as a
‘salt and pepper’
have had the effect of
making those who are disadvantaged even more difficult to see within the
community, as there are few obviously
‘poor’ suburbs or areas in the

Defining People Who are at Risk of Elder
The statistics outlined above do not tell the full story of elder abuse in
the ACT, or indeed the pervasiveness of elder abuse within
the wider community,
meaning a better evidence base must be developed. The starting point must be
doing away with the assumption
that one is at risk of elder abuse simply by
virtue of being over 65 and no longer working. It is suggested here that these
assumptions
are wrongly made because people over 65 are a statistical
‘benchmark’ recorded by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics.
As submitted by
Legal Aid ACT to the
, assessing an elderly
person’s capacity independently of their age may be a far more effective
metric by which to measure the
of risk elder abuse than simply age
Making the assumption a
person over 65 is unable to enter an arrangement without it being tainted by
abuse is highly paternalistic.
This does nothing more than foster the very same
assumptions that allow elder abuse to occur – namely, an assumption that
elderly person is incapable of managing their own
It ultimately
represents a simplistic notion of vulnerability that assumes because a person
possesses a particular characteristic,
in this case age, they are therefore at
risk of abuse or neglect.
By the same token, it cannot be assumed that a person under 65 has the
capacity to enter into agreements without an appropriate assessment
that they understand the effect of those
agreements.
Taking a more
nuanced approach than simply checking a person’s age to how we assess
whether a person is at risk of abuse is
ultimately necessary to ensure legal
services are appropriately targeted to address elder abuse. This necessarily
requires a rights-based
approach, in an endeavour to ensure an open and active
dialogue with the older person to get a full understanding of the circumstances
in which they find themselves.
This is critical whether they are a 90 year old man living with a loving and
caring family or a 59 year old cognitively impaired
woman living alone with
limited family interaction.
Cultural and Social Issues in Defining Who is at
The difficulty in defining who may be at risk of elder abuse is made even
more problematic when considered from a non-Anglo-Saxon
background, particularly
the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. The statistics are
compelling in this regard: an Indigenous
woman is likely to live 9.5 years less
than a non-Indigenous woman while an Indigenous man will likely live 10.6 years
a non-Indigenous man.
While this gap has slowly been closing over the
it is nonetheless
substantial. Additionally, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are more
likely to become grandparents
at a younger age than those from a non-Indigenous
background.
With these factors
in mind, how we define an elderly person in the Indigenous community for the
purpose of elder abuse cannot be
undertaken in the same manner as with the wider
community. In fact, even the term ‘elder’ has a special connotation
the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, being associated with
authority and knowledge.
also underlines why notions of elder rights, rather than simply elder abuse,
provide a better paradigm for identifying need
and best practice modes of
service delivery.
Disabilities can also have a large impact on the risk of elder abuse for an
individual. Cognitive impairment in particular has been
shown to increase the
risk a person faces of being subject to elder

such as socioeconomic status.
This can have the effect of possibly aggravating any condition an elderly person
may have, further increasing their risk of experiencing
abuse. Abuse could also
have the impact of impairing the cognitive function of someone not considered an
elder, yet opening them
up to further abuse commonly categorised as elder abuse,
particularly asset mismanagement. This again muddies the waters surrounding

illustrating the need for a nuanced approach to how legal
services are delivered
to those at risk of elder abuse.
The limited information regarding elder abuse in the ACT is reflective of the
underreporting of elder abuse that has been a constant
feature of the literature
in this area.
This, combined
with socio-economic and cultural context couching who is at risk of elder abuse,
is why legal services must take into
account the actual circumstances of an
individual. In particular, noting that a person’s cultural background,
socio-economic
status or cognitive ability may have a far bigger impact on their
risk of elder abuse than simply age itself.
Given the hidden nature of elder abuse, and socio-economic disadvantage
generally, in the ACT, it is a challenge to assess and provide
an appropriately
individualised legal service response to elder abuse. This issue is further
compounded by the constant battles with
funding the legal sector faces, limiting
capacity to provide early intervention services, often an efficient and
cost-effective means
of legal problem
Despite these issues,
what is certain is that the need for legal services addressing elder abuse in
the ACT clearly exists and is
not being met.

THE AUSTRALIAN LAW REFORM COMMISSION REPORT

a policy milestone and will form a substantial platform for the future. It
imperative that the recommendations and findings from the Report are not left as
mere academic curiosities without any action
taken towards their implementation.
With that in mind, consideration is now given to some of the key points raised
ALRC Report
, particularly those which will impact on how both
legal service delivery and law reform can complement each other to address elder
abuse. Of particular significance is the recognition that the acknowledgment of
elder abuse must mature into a discussion about elder
rights ensuring that
informed and appropriate decisions can be made, and how that may be balanced
with a number of the protective
recommendations made.
The Role of Legal Aid Commissions in Helping
Develop a National Plan
The headline recommendation to come out of the ALRC report was that of a
National Plan to combat elder

consideration would need to be given to the role

specifically related to elder abuse, the NPA places legal aid commissions and
community legal centres in a position to
be easily integrated into any national
plan that is implemented. However, it is important the role of legal aid
services is not limited
only to providing legal advice and representation.
Rather, legal aid services are able to play a large role in preventing elder

done through informing people about their rights and empowering them to solve
legal issues as they arise.
Therefore, it is critical that any national plan implemented considers how CLE
can play a role in addressing elder abuse, not only
in educating those at risk
but informing the wider community of the warning signs and potential
consequences. Utilising the resources
of community legal services that are
already in place should certainly be a major consideration in implementing a
nationwide CLE
program. Involving both legal aid commissions and community legal
centres would allow for consistency in the message that is produced.
Furthermore, the nature of CLE as an outreach service provides a means of
reaching out to the ‘hidden’ victims of elder
abuse empowering them,
or sympathetic friends and family, to speak up and seek legal advice or

The Potential for Abuse through Enduring Powers of
Executing an enduring power of attorney (EPOA) is a common step taken by many
elderly people to ensure decisions can be made regarding
their finances or
medical treatment in the event that they lose decision making capacity. However,
the power received by a person
who is appointed by an EPOA necessarily imposes a
risk that power can be abused.
As raised by the
ALRC Report
, while each jurisdiction allows a mechanism
for appointing an attorney, there are differences in the obligations and
reporting mechanisms
across the states and
territories.
Furthermore, many
principals and attorneys enter these agreements without regard to the legal
ramifications involved or the obligations
imposed upon the
Accordingly, when the
elderly person loses decision-making capacity, they will be placed in a position
where they will be unable
to identify any breaches of the power of attorney and
lack the ability to seek
The potential for abuse occurring under an EPOA is, for the most part,
self-evident because the person for whom decisions are being
made will not be in
a position to challenge those decisions. As the elderly person will not have
capacity whilst an EPOA is in effect,
often there may not be a chance for any
decisions made under an EPOA to be challenged or examined until after the
elderly person
dies and the effects of the decisions can be
identified.
Furthermore, a
person appointed under an EPOA may potentially also be the executor of an
elderly person’s estate, making it
difficult for the elderly
person’s wishes to be enforced even by a third
Appropriate Protections of Principals and
Restriction of Attorneys
An EPOA is intended to provide appropriate protections for the principal,
that is, the person who may be subject to the abuse. In
the ACT, there is no
requirement for the parties to seek legal advice nor for there to be a witness
present with either legal expertise
or the ability to assess capacity when the
agreement is executed. Currently, a witness to the execution of an EPOA need

they appeared to understand the nature and effect of the power
There would be
benefits to having more restrictive processes in safeguarding the interests of
older people when they execute an EPOA.
However, this need not necessarily be
done through demanding witnesses have an ability to assess capacity, rather the
an EPOA agreement (particularly the principal) should be required to
seek legal advice before entering into the

an assessment of a person’s decision-making capacity without the need for
a specialised witness to be
present when the EPOA is executed, and would help
ensure a principal understands the gravity of executing an EPOA when they lose
their decision-making capacity.
Currently, in the ACT, there are no restrictions on who can be appointed as
an attorney. Creating restrictions was addressed in the
ALRC Report
through making a list of ineligible persons, including if the person:
(a) is an undischarged bankrupt;
(b) is prohibited from acting as a director under the
Corporations Act
(c) has been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty; or
(d) is, or has been, a care worker, a health provider or an accommodation
provider for
the principal.
Both (a) and (c) are identical to criteria found in the
Guardianship and
Management of Property Act 1991
(ACT) preventing a person from being
appointed a guardian or manager.
Meanwhile, paragraph (b) reflects the fiduciary nature of the director-company
relationship, with those individuals who have made
dishonest or seriously
reckless decisions regarding a company disqualified from being appointed as a
Considering an
attorney is burdened with similar fiduciary duties to a director, due to the
vulnerability of the principal,
this represents an appropriate safeguard. The final criterion (d) preventing
care workers from being appointed with an EPOA is clearly
made in response to
some of the issues highlighted surrounding elder abuse in aged care
facilities.
These criteria represent sensible restrictions and, at least in the ACT, are
consistent with criteria preventing people from being
appointed guardians. As
recognised by the ALRC,
indeed submitted by Legal Aid ACT, an exception should exist to criteria (d) for
family members who provide care for an elderly
Despite the fact that
often elder abuse will be perpetrated by a close family
it is important to
remember that in many cases an elderly person will want to have their affairs
dealt with by a person they trust
and who often will understand their wishes.
Restrictions on appointments are certainly necessary but it is important they do
undermine the purpose of the appointment, ensuring the principal’s
wishes, and consequently their rights, are respected.
Managing Principal and Attorney Conflicts of

interests and the interests of an older principal may

indicated legislation specifically targeted at
conflict transactions should be enacted to protect the assets of an elderly
who has executed an EPOA.
This would be in addition to the already present legislative provisions dealing
with conflict transactions
Specific legislation
enacted would require legal education, and indeed legal advice, before any
agreement to enter into an EPOA arrangement
is made. Legal advice to both
principals and attorneys, would help both parties recognise a conflict
transaction when it occurs (either
generally or in reference to any enacted
legislation), preventing the need for an independent party to identify a
conflict and authorise
that particular
transaction.
Empowering elderly
people with the information required to execute an EPOA ensures that they are
heavily involved in the decision,
reflecting the importance of a rights-based
dialogue in this area. Legal advice could also be coupled with mandatory
registration
of those who have been appointed with powers of
providing more
accountability for decisions made under an EPOA and an additional safeguard for
any appointment.
These measures,
while not necessarily completely preventing situations such as those in
Reilly v Reilly
from occurring, would increase the scrutiny given to EPOA
arrangements where a family member is appointed as an Attorney.
The Potential for Financial Abuse in Family
With financial abuse being particularly associated with elder
it is no surprise
informal family agreements can play a large part in enabling abuse to occur. As
elder abuse often is a complex
interaction between social factors such as
familial relationships, environmental factors such as low levels of social
support and
physical factors such as decreased mobility or disease and
disorders, it is easy to see how informal ‘assets for care’
agreements lead to abuse as elderly people become more dependent on others for

support, possibly one who is currently living with them, even
if that family
member is not entirely capable of undertaking such a

This agreement does not
necessarily lead to elder abuse, but certainly increases the risk of it
The Difficulty in Enforcing Rights under an Assets
for Care Arrangement
These arrangements necessarily bring with them a heightened risk of a
transaction being tainted by undue influence or unconscionability,
then provide a legal avenue for the elderly person to challenge the transaction.
However, a transaction made where property
is transferred from a parent to a
child is not one where the law presumes that undue influence exists, rather

antecedent relationship must be
It is likely that in
those cases where an elderly person has a cognitive impairment,

a highly relevant
In these circumstances
any argument over whether such a transaction was unduly influenced will often
not be put forward until after
the death of the elderly person and the estate
has been executed.
In cases where cognitive impairment is not present, identifying undue
influence or unconscionability may prove more difficult as on
its face the
agreement made was mutually beneficial at the
This may mean, as noted by
the ALRC, proprietary or equitable estoppel provides a more appropriate

of action would still require conduct on behalf of the family member that would
make it unconscionable to
not honour the agreement the elderly person has relied
While this conduct can be
assessed on inferences and conduct
the absence of any formal
documentation in these agreements would likely negatively impact on the
evidentiary burden the elderly
person would ultimately bear. For a court,
examining family arrangements many years after the fact with a view to
determining a legal
or equitable interest is ultimately not an easy task, even
when there is a level of agreement as to the wishes of the elderly
In any event, if such an agreement is made, it is often done quite informally
and without the benefit of legal advice as to how it

person’s rights or income

breaks down, which will occur if elder abuse arises, the older person may be in
a situation where they have no
legal interest in their property and are
unwilling to pursue a remedy due to the costs involved or the further damage it

The provision of
independent legal advice is a critical factor in rebutting the presumption that
a transaction was unduly
influenced.
Clearly it is
important that legal advice is given early to ensure that the consequences are
appropriately understood. This could
members following the death of an elderly person and provide appropriate
protection for
elderly people making these transactions.
A further complication, as outlined in the
ALRC Report
, in preventing
these agreements is because the arrangements may result in a ‘granny flat
interest’ which is exempt from
the ‘gifting rules’ affecting
the older person’s asset assessment for the purposes of social welfare
Therefore, any changes
that formalise these agreements may encourage older people to undertake them.
Noting the gifting exemption
that currently exists, this could potentially place
a larger number of people at risk of abuse. It is therefore critical that
people considering these arrangements are informed about the
consequences and their rights, as it can be difficult to enforce a legal
equitable interest after an agreement breaks down. Financial arrangements are
therefore an area where CLE can be vital, informing
elderly people of the risks
involved in ‘assets for care’ arrangements and perhaps even
providing limited assistance.
Providing an Appropriate Forum for Resolving
Disputes in Elder Abuse Matters
An important procedural element in elder abuse matters is providing an
appropriate forum to resolve disputes. While in some situations
a crime will
have been committed and it will be appropriate to involve the police, for the
most part the issues that will be faced
by the elderly are unlikely to attract
the immediate interest of police – disputes involving wills, estates and
powers of attorney,
all of which have been discussed to some extent
These are areas of law in
which great care needs to be taken when seeking specialist advice from
solicitors. The nature of these
disputes often means a matter will require a
hearing in the Supreme Court,
depending on the monetary value
The cost and time that
it would take for an elderly person to pursue such a matter is often more than
enough to discourage them from
engaging a lawyer to help them enforce their
rights. Additionally, in the ACT, if any loss has been suffered due to the
exercise of an EPOA, an application must be made to the Supreme Court
to receive compensation, whether made by the elderly person
interested party.
This places a
near-insurmountable barrier on an elderly person who may have been left without
any assets due to elder abuse.
However, this barrier could be removed, as the ALRC and multiple stakeholders
suggest, through extending the jurisdiction of state
and territory tribunals in
relation to family agreements and EPOA
This would make the
process much easier, since the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal (ACAT)
already has the power to revoke or
Extending the jurisdiction
of ACAT and other tribunals to allow for compensation orders or determination in
family agreement disputes
would remove the significant cost barrier associated
with taking court action along with simplifying the process, something which
key considering the vulnerability of many of those suffering from elder abuse
and the complexity of the current legal framework.
A simplified system of
resolving these disputes would help empower elderly people to enforce their
rights in cases of abuse.
The Risks of Instituting Adult Safeguarding
Legislation – Balancing Autonomy and Protection
This paper has argued against a reductionist approach to elder abuse and
vulnerability. In that regard, it is important that special
attention is given
to Chapter 14 of the
ALRC Report
discussing at-risk adults and safeguards
that could be put in place to protect
The fallacy of assuming
that only those over 65 need protection, while those under 65 do not, was
recognised by the ALRC, who noted
a ‘functional’ approach to
vulnerability was preferred.
How we safeguard those at risk of elder abuse is an important factor in the
law’s response to the issue, particularly noting
that implementing
safeguarding laws without nuance or consideration of the particular individual
has the potential to do more harm
It is important that,
in line with the ALRC’s focus on respecting the autonomy and agency of the
we ensure that we do

This principle
must be kept in mind when adult safeguarding legislation is drafted. However,
with that being said, the ALRC Report
notes the problem of respecting a
person’s autonomy to the point of not acting within their best

that whatever policy change is put in place, it strikes a balance between

submissions to the
ALRC noted, that abuse can have an impact on a person’s
autonomy, meaning even if they may objectively be assessed as having
decision-making capacity in regards to refusing a safeguard measure, they may
not be expressing their actual
Hence, if on the one hand there is a principle espousing autonomy and on the
other hand protection, how do we respond to the ALRC’s
proposed principles
relating to adult safeguarding legislation in cases where an older
person’s decision-making capacity is
compromised?
After all, any assessment of
capacity is already a protectionist measure where an external party makes a
decision as to whether someone
has the autonomy to make decisions for
themselves.
As noted by the
ALRC, a balance between protection and respect for an older person’s
rights is required.
Additionally, the Report goes on to note an older person’s ‘will,
preferences and rights’ must be respected and
that they have the
‘right to refuse support’, further highlighting the importance of
Furthermore, there
is a risk that in instituting adult protection legislation, the principles
guiding child protection legislation
are used to inform the drafting of
legislation directed at protecting older people. While these principles, in the
ACT, do account
for the wishes of a child in determining their best interests,
their wishes are but one factor of 12 to be
considered.
This approach
could potentially clash with a number of human rights as found in the
Rights Act 2004
(ACT), most notably the right to equal recognition before
As noted in a report
by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the General Assembly, the
analogue to
Human Rights Act
(being Article 26 of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) extends to discrimination
in any field regulated by
authorities.
Conceivably,
this could include protection agencies established for elderly people. In this
regard, formulating adult protection
legislation without appropriate
consideration of the autonomy of the older person would potentially be a
discriminatory action impacting
upon an elderly person’s recognition
before the law.
Consequently, the best approach must be to balance the potential risks
associated with an over-paternalistic approach, and using a
decision to not receive protection as a means to pursue the principle of
autonomy at the expense of their
assessments of decision making capacity under the
Mental Health Act 2015
(ACT), the starting point must be that an older person understands the decision
that they are making, meaning that decision must
There is room in a
rights-based approach to undertake some protectionist measures, especially in
regards to cognitively impaired
older people, but those measures should not be
considered without accounting for the views of the older person.
Improving Coordination between Organisations in
Responding to Elder Abuse
The ALRC report made a number of recommendations about increased coordination
and cooperation between health, medical and legal services,
seeking consent from
the at-risk adult before commencing action or investigation, and instituting
statutory protections from civil
liability for those who may report suspected
abuse to the authorities.
Having a coordinated response is critical, as the current safeguard system is
quite disjointed with multiple services and agencies
involved in protecting the
A potential factor
is the discombobulated responsibilities regarding elder abuse, with the
Commonwealth having appropriated power

adult protection legislation.
It is deeply problematic if people are unaware of what service may be required,
or may be reluctant to report abuse for fear of reprisal
or straining family
relationships if they report elder abuse to the
For instance, in the

capacity issues coupled with
a risk of elder abuse. The lawyer may then contact

The obvious problem with this approach is that the pathway for
assistance is ill
defined and ultimately reliant on the lawyer’s personal knowledge and
Additionally, while there are multiple legislative definitions of
decision-making capacity,
is possible different organisations may assess a person’s capacity in
different ways – whether from a legal or medical
perspective.
Furthermore, a
service provider, whether they are legal or medical in nature, may only have a
short period of time in which to identify
abuse and, even if that abuse is
identified, often there will not be a chance for that service provider to follow
up with the report.
it is clearly in the best interests of victims of elder abuse for there to be a
reporting agency or process that can streamline
and coordinate an investigation
into an older person’s capacity or well-being. This also points towards
establishing publicly
available and inexpensive legal aid services.

ARLC Report
points out that it is the duty of all governments, community organisations and
those with the power to reform the law to
ensure these findings are properly
considered and implemented. What has been outlined above represents a broad view
of how these
findings may be received and implemented. It also suggests that the
debate needs to take more cognisance of how the rights of elderly
impacted by abuse, and that we need to shift the discussion toward a
rights-based dialogue. In short, the response to

that elder abuse is an

IV DEVELOPING A SOCIO-LEGAL MODEL OF SERVICE
Currently, our mode of legal service delivery could be improved to better
meet the legal needs and wishes of the elderly, particularly
those who are most
at risk of suffering elder abuse. This was illustrated by the 2012 Legal
Australia-Wide Survey, which indicated
those over 65 were less likely to seek

Many elderly
people may not understand their rights or are not aware of the availability of
legal services to address their

elderly people from a culturally or linguistically diverse (CALD) background are

The interwoven and complex nature of all social factors and the legal

just outcomes. A holistic approach in
this area can best be delivered though a
socio-legal method of service delivery. This is a method of delivery requiring
cooperation
across multiple disciplines including legal, law enforcement, health
and social organisations and the client
themselves.
The coordination
between a team made up of professionals from a wide variety of disciplines has
proven to be an effective means of
addressing elder
While this represents
a ‘gold standard’ approach, with a fully coordinated team working to
address the issues of one

one profession, whether a lawyer, doctor or social worker, will take on a form
of ‘accidental case management’,
using their own connections with
other organisations and agencies to respond to the issues raised by an elderly
Even with this ad-hoc
approach, referrals to different agencies are critical in addressing the complex
environmental and social factors
associated with elder
In other words, a
legal service cannot simply focus on the legal problem at hand in relation to a
matter raising the possibility
of elder abuse.
It is worth noting from a legal services perspective, if an elderly client
presents with a legal issue, it is quite likely abuse has
already occurred, or
indeed is continuing to

obviously further complicated by the ‘hidden’ nature of elder abuse,
with there being a large risk that an elderly
client may not present at all,
especially when coupled with the hidden nature of disadvantage in the ACT.
However, this can be mitigated
through the provision of outreach services.
The Importance of Outreach Services in a
Socio-Legal Model
It is critical for a socio-legal model of service delivery that outreach
services are provided at locations where vulnerable elderly
people are likely to
be found. This not only has the effect of informing the elderly about the
services available, but also helps
to break down some of the barriers the
elderly may face in accessing services, notably inabilities to go out to legal
This also helps to
establish relationships with community organisations, further expanding the
ability of a legal service to make
referrals, enhancing their ability to deliver
services consistent with a socio-legal
Not only can education
be provided through outreach, but a lawyer can also be present to provide
limited legal advice or to facilitate
a further session if
Once a client does engage a legal service provider, it is important that
services are in place or easily accessible, so as to address
the social and
environmental problems accompanying the legal issue at hand. One way of doing
this is through embedding a social worker
in the legal service, helping the
client to understand the advice given and placing the lawyer in a better
position to understand
the multitude of issues that have led the client to seek
legal advice.
This is not a
unique concept, or indeed a modern one, with research going back over 35 years
indicating the benefits of having social

The social worker would also be able to
follow-up with the client, ensuring that they understood any advice given and to
that they are ‘doing okay’.
The ultimate goal of a socio-legal model of service delivery is to break down
the barriers faced by older people in accessing justice.
Once those barriers
have been broken down, it then becomes possible to provide them with a service
that addresses more than just
the legal problem at hand. Outreach and education
are vital factors in achieving the first goal while a multi-disciplinary
that coordinates legal, health and social services is critical to
achieving the second. Use of this approach has evolved out of discussion

violation of many of the rights an elderly person is
entitled to

approach rather neatly relates to discussion of respecting a person’s
equality before the law.
this sense, a socio-legal model is a critical aspect of a rights-based approach,
treating the elderly person as more than simply
a legal problem and involving
them in the resolution of their issues.
V HOW LEGAL AID SERVICES ARE RESPONDING TO THE
CHALLENGES OF ELDER ABUSE
The responses to the
ALRC Report
, such as those outlined above, and a
socio-legal model of service delivery, detail how the ‘big picture’
response to
elder abuse may take shape. Legislative reform and national
coordination regarding CLE are initiatives that will take time to develop
implement, even when considering the already present infrastructure provided by
legal aid commissions and community legal centres.
For instance, in Victoria and
Queensland, seniors’ rights services have been established with a mind to
protecting and respecting
the rights and dignity of older people in providing
legal services.
services provide a model for legal assistance that can be replicated across the
country either by legal aid commissions or
independent providers, particularly
with a focus on rights-based delivery. In that regard, over the last 12 months
Legal Aid ACT
has been investigating how best to provide services to the elderly
community in the ACT ensuring their rights are acknowledged and

the particular problems surrounding service delivery to
those suffering elder
abuse are clearly identified. This is further highlighted by the demographics of
the ACT, particularly in relation
to the hidden nature of disadvantage in the
This ultimately places
more emphasis on the outreach and social service referral aspects of legal
service delivery. These services
not only help to ‘shine a light’ on
hidden victims, but also serve to empower an elderly person to assert any rights
that have been violated due to the occurrence of elder abuse.
Instituting Health Justice Partnerships and
Outreach Services
One way in which we can reach the most vulnerable in our community is through
instituting health justice partnerships. These types
of partnerships were
originally seen in the United States, where the aim was to provide a better
means to address the social factors
surrounding illness, especially in regards
to vulnerable patients.

parties involved, including the clients themselves,
with a particular focus on

practitioners and indeed awareness of medical

it is the stress associated with seeking
legal assistance or limited

partnerships also allow for warm referrals, as information can be taken back to
a lawyer or community worker, providing
them with a ‘head start’
before the client comes to see
In the context of elder
health justice
partnerships facilitate medical staff to take action once it is recognised that
a vulnerable elderly person may be
at risk of abuse while they are in the
hospital. The medical staff can then refer the matter to a lawyer or
representative from a
legal service present at the hospital, who can then
provide information back to the legal service allowing a lawyer to be briefed
and get in touch with the client. This cooperation allows for early intervention
by legal services, preventing issues from arising
and moving the focus from harm
minimisation to harm prevention. Furthermore, these are individuals who would
likely be considering
an assets for care arrangement, providing an opportunity
to provide them with advice on the potential consequences.
Currently, for example, Legal Aid ACT runs outreach sessions at the Canberra
Hospital, providing a way for patients, families or visitors
to ask for legal
information or limited advice, or even to be booked for a further interview at a
later time. The program was initiated
in August 2017, and recorded 135 client
interactions as of December 2017. Of these 135 interactions, 54 were referred to

Additionally, the largest age group of individuals seen were those over
of age. While this may be reflective of the higher likelihood of hospitalisation
of elderly people, especially those with

why hospitals and other health care facilities in the ACT are appropriate places
for establishing a legal presence
to combat elder abuse. This partnership is in
its infancy but, as time goes on, a closer relationship is being built, allowing
greater cooperation in the provision of a socio-legal service. Importantly,
this partnership allows legal advice and assistance to
be provided at the early
stages of a matter when a client presents to a hospital rather than the legal
service itself.
explicitly part of any plan to combat elder abuse, outreach at the Canberra
Hospital serves to connect elderly clients
with legal services at a stage when
it is possible to prevent legal issues, such as those involving EPOAs, before
they arise.
Additionally, Legal Aid ACT has partnered with Libraries ACT to not only
place lawyers and staff at Libraries across the ACT, but
also to package Legal
Aid ACT information so it can be provided to clients of the Home Library Service

people to whom they deliver library

the difficulties in simply using age as a
risk factor for elder abuse, this service will help to connect Legal Aid ACT
with a greater
number of people who may be at risk of elder abuse rather than
simply servicing those over 65.
Providing Social Liaison Support to Vulnerable
As part of the socio-legal model of service delivery, it is optimal that a
social worker is present and embedded within a legal service
non-legal support. Currently Legal Aid ACT provides social support workers for
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients,
clients from a culturally and
linguistically diverse background and clients who are suffering from family
violence. These liaison
officers are an invaluable resource to Legal Aid ACT,
community organisations. These officers often work with some of the most
vulnerable clients who come to Legal Aid ACT, and indeed
clients who could be at
a greater risk of elder abuse than the general
population.
Ensuring these
liaison officers are available to elderly clients is critical in providing a
holistic service which is sensitive to
attitudes that may cause or allow the
perpetration of elder abuse. This is especially important in the context of
Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander clients, where there are unique issues
regarding elder abuse, because an Indigenous liaison officer can break
of the barriers faced by older people in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander community from accessing legal services.
Expanding Legal Aid Services in the
Early resolution of disputes through a structured mediation process is the
most obvious area to next reform. Legal aid commissions
have shown to address
elder abuse an approach that draws from family dispute resolution (FDR)

elder abuse are picked up early, provides a
non-confrontational means of resolving the
Legal Aid ACT, as is
the case with all legal aid commissions, has a large amount of experience in
running FDR conferences, and this
experience can certainly be applied in the
elder abuse sphere. The use of FDR-like conferencing in elder abuse matters
would likely
be best placed as an early intervention
This situation might
arise where there is a dispute over assets or care arrangements before any
tangible harm has occurred. Early
intervention would also serve to remove one of
the major barriers to justice faced by elderly people – the fear of
down family
relationships.
The complex
nature of these family relationships often requires a ‘delicate’
approach that cannot be provided in the
courtroom. Moreover, mediation and
dispute resolution can be tailored to meet the needs of all parties
Arguably, it is
also important that the conference is not used as a method of assessing
capacity, as that could be used to unduly
influence not only the mediation

decision-making capacity, which would fit in with its
purpose as an early
intervention service.
would allow for an elderly person’s views to be reflected in any decision
or solution reached, which is vital in ensuring
their rights are appropriately
Finally, it is important to acknowledge that the formal processes of
obtaining legal assistance can be a specific barrier for elderly
people. Older
people can often be in a situation where they are asset-rich, as they may own an
unencumbered property, yet income-poor,
preventing them from accessing the
services of a private lawyer.
This is problematic, as in cases of elder abuse, while the older person may own
the property, they may not have control over it,
thus preventing them from using
that asset to fund private
representation.

providing more flexibility in how they are

VI CONCLUSION
Legal aid commissions will be at the forefront of Australia’s response
to elder abuse. Vulnerable and disadvantaged people form
the core clientele of
legal aid. The
ALRC Report
shows that the justice system and its
attendant institutions are not yet well designed to meet the legal needs of the
elderly community,
and their recommendations for a coherent national response to
elder abuse is timely. The innovative work performed by legal aid commissions,
as has been illustrated in this paper by the approach taken in the ACT, shows
that solutions can be found to enhance the accessibility
of legal assistance to
victims of elder abuse. In particular, whether through outreach services or
clear lines of referral from social
services to legal services providers, early
identification of people at risk of abuse is crucial to a successful provision
assistance to the elderly in our community. Legal aid services must
find ways to cross the gap that can be created by age and isolation,
so that the
often hidden nature of elder abuse is exposed.
Clearly, legal aid commissions are well placed to develop better platforms
for delivering services to victims of elder abuse. They
already have extensive
experience providing community legal education and specialist service to
vulnerable and disadvantaged people
– including Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islanders and people from culturally and linguistically diverse
communities. However,
the ability to improve specialised service to elderly
people, or indeed to relax means tests, is related to the capacity of legal
commissions to provide that service. This is not simply a question of
redirecting resources, but is fundamentally a challenge
to government to make
the necessary investment in legal aid. Capacity is necessarily tied to funding,
and the battles legal aid commissions
and community legal centres have had with
insufficient funding are well
documented.
funding would allow specialised service to better redress the disadvantaged who
are faced by the often hidden nature of
elder abuse. With the national spotlight
on elder abuse becoming ever brighter, it is hoped Federal and State and
Territory governments
will quickly respond to the bourgeoning needs of the most
vulnerable and disadvantaged ageing population and, most significantly,
resituate strategies around a new notion of elder rights.

request received, however is reflective of the larger number of people who will
not be able to get assistance in these areas.

person) of the deceased (who had been suffering

principal under the EPOA. This case required a complex examination of equitable
principles regarding not only fiduciary duties, but also receipt of trust money
by other beneficiaries to the will.
