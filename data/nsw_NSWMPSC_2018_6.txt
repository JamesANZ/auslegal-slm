BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY
n December 2014 Patient A, who was 86 years old at the time, was admitted to
Calvary Mater Newcastle Hospital, where Dr Barker was
a surgical registrar at
the time. Patient A had ongoing anaemia and rectal bleeding. On 28 December 2014
Dr Barker was requested
to band Patient A’s haemorrhoids. On examination,
Dr Barker noticed that the patient had a pedunculated polyp protruding from
anus. He invited a junior medical officer to perform a polypectomy procedure on
the ward to resect the polyp, and supervised
the procedure.
oon after cutting the polyp its stalk began to bleed, the endoloop being used
to hold the stalk of the polyp slipped and the stalk
retracted. In the course of
attempting to control the bleeding, Dr Barker was asked twice whether he would
like the assistance of
the hospital’s Rapid Response Team, but he declined
assistance. Dr Barker did not call for assistance from his supervising
Dr Adeeb Majid, however Dr Majid did come to arrive on the ward and assist in
attempting to stop the bleeding.
he attempts to locate the stalk and stop the bleeding were unsuccessful and
to the operating
theatre where she died.
he Health Care Complaints Commission (the
) obtained the
hospital records and a number of statements from the relevant doctors and
nurses. An expert report was obtained from
A/Professor Anil Keshava. The
Commission’s complaint, which is the basis of the inquiry conducted by the
Committee, was based
upon A/Professor Keshava’s report.
hearing was held on 3 May 2018 when evidence was heard from A/Professor
Keshava and Dr Barker. The people who had provided witness
statements were not
required by Dr Barker for cross examination.
THE COMPLAINT
n amended complaint dated 1 May 2018, provided to the Committee by the
Commission on 2 May 2018, is set out in full as an attachment
to this decision.
It alleges that Dr Barker is guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct under
section 139B(1)(a) of the
National Law
in that he has engaged in conduct
that demonstrates the knowledge, skill or judgment possessed, or care exercised,
by him in the practice
of medicine is significantly below the standard
reasonably expected of a practitioner of an equivalent level of training or
n short, it is alleged that Dr Barker did not obtain the consent of the
patient for the polypectomy, that Dr Barker should not have
decided to perform
the procedure on the ward and that Dr Barker provided inadequate care for
Patient A between the time of the procedure
and her transfer to the operating
THE RESPONDENT’S BACKGROUND
r Barker graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery from the
University of Sydney in 2006. He worked as a senior resident
in surgery for a
number of hospitals in 2008 and from 2009 to 2015 he worked as a general
surgical trainee for a number of hospitals
including the Calvary Mater Newcastle
n 2015 he passed his fellowship exam and obtained his fellowship with the
Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in 2017. In that
year he was appointed a
Staff Specialist General Surgeon at Armidale Rural Referral Hospital. For a
number of years, he has been
employed as a medical officer in the Army reserves.
He was deployed to the Middle East for about 6 months in 2012.
r Barker has no conditions on his practice of medicine.
THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK
he objectives of the national registration and accreditation scheme
established by the
Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (NSW)
National Law
) include to provide for the protection of the public by
ensuring that only health practitioners who are suitably trained and qualified
to practise in a competent and ethical manner are registered: s 3(2)(a). That
objective is not confined to protecting the patients
or potential patients of an
individual practitioner from any continuing risk of his or her malpractice or
incompetence. It also includes
protecting the public from similar misconduct or
incompetence by other practitioners, and upholding public confidence in the
of the profession:
Health Care Complaints Commission v Do
[2014] NSWCA 307
t is a guiding principle of the national registration and accreditation
scheme established by the National Law that restrictions on
the practice of the
medical profession are to be imposed under the scheme only if it is necessary to
ensure health services are provided
safely and are of an appropriate quality:
National Law s 3(c).
n exercising a function under the National Law, the Committee is required to
have regard to the objectives and guiding principles
of the national
registration and accreditation scheme established by the National Law (National
Law s 4), however, the protection
of the health and safety of the public must be
the Committee’s paramount consideration: National Law s 3A.
Unsatisfactory professional conduct
nsatisfactory professional conduct of a medical practitioner is defined in
the National Law to include the circumstances set out in
section 139B(1) of the
National Law. This definition includes, relevantly, conduct that demonstrates
the knowledge, skill or judgment
possessed, or care exercised, by the
practitioner in the practice of the practitioner’s profession is
significantly below the
standard reasonably expected
of a practitioner of an equivalent level of training or experience (National
Law s 139B(1)(a)).
he full text of section 139B of the National Law (NSW) and other relevant
provisions is attached to these reasons and marked as
Attachment 2
he phrase “significantly below the standard reasonably expected of a
practitioner of an equivalent level of training or experience”
defined in the National Law. However, in
Re A Medical Practitioner and the
Medical Practice Act
(unreported, NSWMT, 3 September 2007), Deputy
Chairperson Judge Freeman stated (in relation to legislation in the same terms
139B of the National Law) that “[a]s a general principle, the
use of the term ‘significant’ may in law be taken
to mean not
trivial, of importance, or substantial.”
Disciplinary powers of the Committee
he Committee may exercise the disciplinary powers conferred on it by section
146B of the National Law if it finds the subject-matter
of a complaint against a
relevant health practitioner to have been proved: National Law s 146A.
he subject matter of a complaint may be broader than individual particulars
of it, and may include the factual matters advanced in
support of it. The
Committee’s role is to conduct an inquiry into a complaint made against a
medical practitioner, informed
as it thinks necessary, and determining any
complaint it considers arises on the material before it. Subject to the
requirements
of procedural fairness, the Committee is not bound by the way in
which a complaint is particularised, or confined in the exercise
of its powers
to make findings and orders by strict reference to the terms of the complaint as
originally advanced:
Shuquan Liu v Health Care Complaints Commission
[2018] NSWSC 315
he purpose of an exercise of the Committee’s disciplinary powers is the
protection of the public and not to punish the practitioner:
Clyne v New
South Wales Bar Association
[1960] HCA 40
(1960) 104 CLR 186.
Nevertheless, imposing
restrictions on the practice of the medical profession by a medical
practitioner who has engaged in unsatisfactory
professional conduct operates as
a deterrent to the individual concerned and to the general body of medical
practitioners. Such restrictions
also maintain public confidence by signaling
that medical practitioners whose conduct does not meet the required standards of
medical profession will have restrictions placed on their registration.
he role of the Committee is to make findings on questions of fact in order to
determine whether the subject-matter of a complaint
has been proven on the
balance of probabilities (having regard to the principles discussed in
Briginshaw v Briginshaw
[1938] HCA 34
(1938) 60 CLR 336
361–362). Once that task has been completed, and the Committee has found
the subject-matter of a complaint
proven, the jurisdictional door to the discretionary powers in s 146B of the
National Law is open, and the Committee’s task
is to determine whether
and, if so, how, to exercise those discretionary powers.
he Committee has read and considered all of the evidence before it, the oral
evidence of Dr Barker and the independent expert given
at the hearing, and the
submissions of the Commission and Dr Ruthnam. The material that the Committee
has considered includes a statement
of agreed facts provided to the Committee
during the hearing of the inquiry. The Committee may not have referred directly
or specifically
within these written reasons to all the evidence and submissions
it has considered.

: On 28 December 2014, between about 10:00am, when
the practitioner examined Patient A, and about 10:15am, when the endoloop
and the polyp stalk began bleeding, the practitioner failed to provide
appropriate care for Patient A in that the practitioner invited
Medical Officer to perform a polypectomy procedure on the ward and then
supervised the Junior Medical Officer perform
a polypectomy procedure on the
ward in circumstances where:
he polyp was not bleeding;
atient A was 86 years old and suffered recurrent anaemia, chronic renal
failure and shortness of breath;
atient A had not had an endoscopy or colonoscopy to exclude other colonic
he practitioner did not sufficiently warn Patient A about material risks of
performing the polypectomy procedure on the ward and/or
explain the alternatives
to performing the polypectomy procedure on the ward;
he polypectomy procedure should have been performed in the operating theatre
or endoscopy suite.
t the hearing of the inquiry on 3 May 2018, A/Professor Keshava, in answering
questions from the Chairperson of the Committee, expressed
the opinion that, in
circumstances as described in particular 1, apart from sub-paragraph (d), Dr
Barker’s conduct fell significantly
below the standard that A/Professor
Keshava would have expected of a practitioner of the same level of training and
experience. Shortly
after A/Professor Keshava gave evidence, counsel for Dr
Barker advised the Committee that Dr Barker admitted particular 1, apart
sub-paragraph (d), as facts and admitted that such conduct constituted
unsatisfactory professional conduct with the meaning
of s 139B(1)(a) of the
National Law.

: On 28 December 2014, from about 10:15am, when the
endoloop slipped and the polyp stalk began bleeding, until about 11:40am, when
Patient A was transferred to the operating theatre, the practitioner failed to
provide appropriate care
for Patient A in that the practitioner continued to attempt to locate the
stalk in circumstances where:
here was inadequate or no retractors;
here was inadequate light;
atient A was bleeding profusely;
atient A’s rectum had not been prepared;
atient A’s rectum was filling with blood;

second endoloop would have been difficult to place and/or unlikely to
control the bleeding;

Team to attend;

rectum to tamponade the bleeding and expedited transfer
to the operating
r Barker’s lawyers made the following admissions with regard to
Particular 2, in writing before the hearing and confirmed orally
at the hearing
after the filing of the Amended Complaint:
r Barker admits sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (j) as facts and further admits
unsatisfactory professional conduct.
r Barker admits sub-paragraph (c) as a fact save that ‘profuse’
is not admitted.
r Barker admits sub-paragraph (d) as a fact but denies his conduct
constitutes unsatisfactory professional conduct.
r Barker admits sub-paragraph (e) but says that it does no more than repeat
sub-paragraph (c).
r Barker admits sub-paragraph (f) as a fact but denies his conduct
constitutes unsatisfactory professional conduct.
r Barker does not admit sub-paragraph (g) as a fact and says that a second
endoloop would have controlled the bleeding. The issue
was one of placing the
second endoloop.
r Barker admits sub-paragraph (h) as a fact but denies his conduct
constitutes unsatisfactory professional conduct.
r Barker admits sub-paragraph (i) and further admits unsatisfactory
professional conduct.
he remaining areas of dispute are limited. On the basis of the admissions
made by Dr Barker, and the matters set out in the agreed
statement of facts, the
Committee finds that the subject matter of the complaint has been proved, and,
as a result, it may exercise
the powers conferred on it by s 146B. Nevertheless,
as the Commission pressed the areas in dispute, the Committee makes the
factual findings.
s to whether Dr Barker failed to sufficiently warn Patient A about material
risks of performing the polypectomy procedure on the ward
and/or explain the
alternatives to performing the polypectomy procedure on the ward, as alleged in
particular 1(d), the evidence
is insufficient to prove this failure. There were
two people present at the time the polypectomy was discussed with Patient A: Dr
Barker and the junior medical officer who ultimately performed the polypectomy.
Neither provides clear evidence about what was and
was not discussed with the
patient prior to the polypectomy. Dr Barker stated in oral evidence that he
could not recall the detail
of what was discussed. In the absence of further
evidence, the Committee cannot make a factual finding about any failures by Dr
with respect to obtaining the patient’s consent, and does not find
this sub-particular proven.
s to whether Patient A was bleeding profusely, as described in particular
2(c), in oral evidence Dr Barker stated that he would not
use the word
“profusely” in a clinical setting. Instead, he stated that he would
describe the bleeding as “uncontrolled”,
that it was
“moderate” and that it was in the order of several hundred
milliliters. In light of Dr Barker’s own
evidence, nothing turns on
whether or not “profuse” is the correct adjective to describe
Patient A’s bleeding.
Nevertheless, the Committee finds that there is
evidence available to support a description of the bleeding as
and that other evidence describing Patient A’s
bleeding accords with the ordinary meaning of that term.
he junior medical officer that performed the polypectomy under Dr
Barker’s supervision stated in a letter to the Commission
dated 6 June
2016 that “the stalk began to bleed profusely” after the endoloop
slipped off.
r Adeeb Majid was a part time surgical staff specialist at the hospital at
the time of these events. He was Dr Barker’s supervising
surgeon and came
to see Patient A after attempts to locate the stalk and stop the bleeding had
been unsuccessful. In a statement
to the Commission dated 11 February 2016, Dr
Majid stated that when he first saw Patient A “she was bleeding
he Macquarie Dictionary defines “profuse”, relevantly, as
“abundant; in great amount”. The Oxford English
Dictionary defines
“profuse” as “abundant, copious; (in early use)
excessive”.
s to sub-particular 2(g), the allegation that a second endoloop would have
been difficult to place and/or unlikely to control the
bleeding, the Committee
finds that the endoloop would have been difficult to place, but had it been
placed it could have controlled
the bleeding. A/Professor Keshava stated in his
report that it would have been almost impossible to accurately identify the
site in an unprepared rectum once the stem of the polyp retracted.
A/Professor Keshava reported that the second endoloop would have
been unlikely
to control the bleeding in this situation, as the site needs to be formally
sutured or clipped with an endoscopic haemoclip.
In oral evidence, A/Professor
Keshava stated that a second endoloop is not used in this situation
ordinarily.
n oral evidence, Dr Barker stated that due to the length of the stalk of the
polyp, he had expected it not to retract into the anus.
Dr Barker also gave
evidence that he would not perform a polypectomy in the manner it was done in
this case again.
t is unnecessary to reach a concluded view on whether the second endoloop,
had it been placed would have stopped the bleeding, however,
the Committee is
satisfied that it could have. Nevertheless, the use of endoloops in this case
was unusual. The Committee finds that
once the stalk of the polyp retracted it
would have been difficult to place the second endoloop.
Summary of our findings
e find proven the factual bases of Particular 1 of the Complaint, apart from
sub- particular (d) (i.e. 1 (a), (b), (c) and (e)) and
the factual basis of
Particular 2 (i.e. 2(a)- (j), noting the Committee’s finding with respect
to sub-particular (g)).
36. We find that each particular, as proven, amounts to unsatisfactory
professional conduct within the meaning of section 139B(1)(a)
of the National
Law (NSW). The Committee makes no findings as to whether each sub-particular is
capable of constituting unsatisfactory
professional conduct on its own, as such
granular findings are unnecessary for the purposes of determining whether the
subject matter
of the complaint has been proven.
APPROPRIATE ORDERS
n light of the views the Committee has reached above, the Committee must
consider how it can exercise its disciplinary powers to best
protect the health
and safety of the public.
onsistent with its protective purpose, the role of this Committee is to
determine whether Dr Barker presents a risk to the health
and safety of the
public as at the time of the Committee’s determination, not at the time at
which Dr Barker treated Patient
he question for the Committee is not simply whether Dr Barker should have
things differently in 2014, but, also, whether Dr Barker would do things
differently if he were presented with Patient A today. Any
actions taken since
2014 by Dr Barker to improve his practice of medicine are highly relevant to
that question.
n his statement of 20 March 2018 Dr Barker made the following comments:
“Since 28 December 2014, I have reflected at length on this sad and
unfortunate event.
In the days following the event I spoke extensively with my supervisors about
what had occurred and discussed the matter with Dr Pooshan
Navathe, the Director
of Medical Services at Maitland Hospital which is where I continued training
following the incident. As a result
of my involvement in the patient's care I
was required to undergo a term of active supervision from February 2015 to July
Maitland Hospital.
In January 2015, I participated in a Root Cause Analysis that was conducted
by the Area Health Service. I also presented and discussed
the incident at the
department Morbidity and Mortality Audit meeting.
I have reviewed the expert report of Associate Professor Keshava and I
accept the criticisms made about my conduct on 28 December
2014. I would not
perform a procedure such as this on the ward again and, with the benefit of
hindsight, I recognise that I could
have responded more effectively after the
endoloop slipped and the polyp stalk began bleeding and that it was becoming
less likely
as time went by that I would be able to locate the stalk on the
ward. Specifically, I should have agreed to a Rapid Response Team
call and/or
called Dr Majid earlier to request his assistance.
I accept that my management of [Patient A] after the endoloop slipped and she
began bleeding was significantly below the standard
expected of a practitioner
of an equivalent level of training or experience, as stated by Associate
Professor Keshava.
As a result of my reflection, discussion and active supervision I have taken
steps to improve and change my practice to avoid an incident
like this in the
future. I have improved my documentation and consent process and now take
considerably more caution when considering
whether it is appropriate to carry
out a procedure on the ward or as an outpatient.
Since the incident I have completed my general surgical training without
incident. I became a Fellow of the Royal Australasian College
of Surgeons in
2017 and was shortly thereafter appointed as a Staff Specialist General Surgeon
at Armidale Rural Referral Hospital.”
he Committee was provided with a number of references for Dr Barker from
current colleagues. These references indicate that Dr Barker
has been open about
the subject matter of the complaint presently under consideration, and
is a valued
member of the surgical team at Armidale. The referees variously indicate that
ractices in a scope which is appropriate to his training and his level of
experience and has always been willing to seek advice and/or
assistance if
s a thoughtful, conscientious, practising general surgeon who can be relied
on to provide sensible advice and very considered treatment
of patients;
as an excellent command in communication;
as excellent clinical and operative skills; and
nows his limitations and asks for help.
n oral evidence, Dr Barker relayed an anecdote about taking guidance from his
colleagues at Armidale via telephone during surgery,
and how valuable he had
found that assistance, and the collegiate nature of his current workplace more
n the basis of the material before the Committee, including the evidence
given by Dr Barker in person, the Committee considers that
Dr Barker has
accepted responsibility for his failings in this case and learned significant
lessons as a result. Dr Barker appears
to have altered his practice in a manner
consistent with that acceptance and learning.
r Barker’s legal representative submitted that a caution was
appropriate in this case, but accepted that a reprimand was open
caution differs from a reprimand in that a reprimand is “an official
rebuke for past wrongful conduct, whereas a caution is
a reminder to take care
in the future and avoid repetition”:
Psychologists Board of Australia v
Coleman (Review and Regulation)
[2013] VCAT 738.
he failings demonstrated by Dr Barker in this case, many of which have been
admitted, were significant. Taking all of the above into
account, including the
seriousness of those failings, the Committee considers that a reprimand is
appropriate.
s to other protective orders, the Committee notes that the events in question
occurred three and a half years ago, and that since
that time Dr Barker has
obtained his fellowship and a position as a staff specialist. The referee
statements and Dr Barker’s
evidence about his current workplace suggest
that he already has sufficient mentors available to him. In these circumstances,
Committee does not consider that any protective orders requiring mentorship
are necessary.
owever, the Committee does consider that conditions requiring further
education are appropriate, given that the essence of Dr Barker’s
in this case related to poor decision-making on his part, including the
following decisions:
erforming the polypectomy on the ward;
he use of endoloops in performing the polypectomy;
efusal of the offer of assistance from the Rapid Response Team;
ailure to call for assistance from his supervising surgeon earlier.
n light of this, the Committee considers that further structured training
around clinical decision making is warranted and appropriate.
The Committee
considers the Clinical Decision Making course run by the Royal Australasian
College of Surgeons to be the most appropriate
course, as it includes tools
“developed as a means to address poor clinical decision making processes,
particularly as a guide
for the supervisor dealing
with a struggling trainee or as a self improvement exercise”:
https://www.surgeons.org/for-health-professionals/register-courses-
events/professional-development/clinical-decision-making/.
he Committee notes that the course is not being run in New South Wales before
the end of 2018, and that Dr Barker performs an important
role at a regional
hospital that ought not be compromised due to the need to travel outside the
State. As a result, the Committee
has imposed a longer timeframe in which to
allow Dr Barker to participate in the course than may otherwise be appropriate.
Nevertheless,
the Committee encourages Dr Barker to participate in the course
this calendar year, if that will not compromise the level of care
provided at
his current workplace.
DETERMINATION
he Committee finds the subject matter of the complaint proven, including that
Dr Barker has engaged in unsatisfactory professional
conduct within the meaning
of section 139B(1)(a) of the National Law.
or the reasons set out above, the Committee makes the following orders:
he practitioner is reprimanded pursuant to s 146B(1)(a) of the National
ursuant to s 146B(1)(b) of the National Law, the practitioner’s
registration shall be subject to the following conditions:
o complete the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons workshop titled
Clinical Decision Making
before 30 June 2019.
ithin six months of 15 June 2018 he must provide evidence to the
Medical Council of NSW of his enrolment in the Royal
Australasian College of Surgeons workshop titled
Clinical Decision
ithin four weeks of completing the abovementioned course, he is to provide
documentary evidence to the Council that he has satisfactorily
completed the
n the event that the abovementioned course is unavailable, no later than 6
months from 15 June 2018 he must propose to the Council
for approval a similar
course to be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of this
o bear responsibility for any costs incurred in meeting this condition.
he practitioner must forward evidence to the Medical Council of NSW within 14
days of 15 June 2018 that he has provided a copy of
his practice conditions to
the Director of Medical Services and Head of Department of General Surgery at
his current workplace.
ithin 14 days of a change in the nature or place of his practice, the
practitioner is to forward evidence to the Medical Council of
NSW that he has
provided a copy of his practice conditions to the Medical Director, Director of
Clinical Services, principal of practice,
supervisor and/or the responsible
senior officer in any place that he works (including any locum agencies and
hospitals).
ursuant to s 163(1)(a) of the National Law, the Committee orders that the
Medical Council of NSW may review order B of these orders
under ss 163A to 163C
of the National Law when the respondent has a principal place of practice in New
South Wales.
he Committee notes that ss 125 to 127 of the National Law will apply should
the respondent’s principal place of practice be
anywhere in Australia
other than in New South Wales, so that the appropriate review body for review of
order B in those circumstances
will be the Medical Board of Australia.
APPEAL AND REVIEW RIGHTS
ursuant to s 158(1) of the National Law, Dr Barker has the right to appeal a
finding of the Committee or the exercise of a power by
the Committee under
Subdivision 3 of Division 3 of the National Law to the NSW Civil and
Administrative Tribunal.
n appeal must be lodged with the Tribunal within 28 days of the date of these
written reasons.
r Barker also has the right to seek a review by the Medical Council of NSW of
the Committee’s order to impose conditions.
NON-PUBLICATION ORDER
he Chairperson of the Committee made a direction in these proceedings that
any evidence as to the name and/or any identifying features
of Patient A not be
published, in accordance with provisions of Clause 7(1)(b)(iv) of Schedule 5D of
the National Law.
DISTRIBUTION OF DECISION
ursuant to section 171E(1) of the National Law the Committee will provide a
copy of this written statement of decision to Dr Barker,
the Committee and the
Medical Council of NSW.
ursuant to section 171E(3) of the National Law the Committee will provide a
copy of this written statement of decision to the Medical
he Committee also recommends to the Council that a de-identified copy of this
written statement of decision be provided to the Royal
Australian College of
