O'GORMAN-WATSON and SECRETARY TO THE DSS
Legislation
Formal decision
Disability support pension: qualification; program of support
O'GORMAN-WATSON and SECRETARY TO THE DSS
Decided: 30th April 2014 by I. Alexander
O’Gorman-Watson was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2000.
Deterioration in her medical condition resulted in her ceasing
employment in
2012. On 31 August 2012, O’Gorman- Watson submitted a claim for disability
support pension (DSP). It was determined
that her condition was permanent, fully
diagnosed, treated and stabilised. Her impairment rating was 25 points across 4
she was deemed incapable of working 15 hours per week. Her
application was rejected as Centrelink found she had not completed a
of support’ (POS) and thus did not have a continuing
inability to work. An authorised review officer (ARO) and the Social Security
Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) affirmed this decision. O’Gorman-Watson then
sought review at the Tribunal.
The Secretary conceded that at the relevant time O’Gorman-Watson
satisfied the requirements of s.94 (1) (a) and s.94 (1) (b)
of the Social
Security Act 1999 (Cth) (‘the Act’). The only issue was whether she
had a continuing inability to work
within the meaning of s.94 (1) (c) and this
turned on whether she had failed to actively participate in a POS in accordance
s.94 (3C). This required consideration of whether she was prevented solely
by her impairment from improving her capacity to find,
gain or remain in
employment through continued participation in the program.
Legislation
Section 94 of the Act provides:
(1) A person is qualified for disability support pension if:
(a) the person has a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment;
(b) the person’s impairment is of 20 points or more under the
Impairment Tables; and
(c) one of the following applies:(i) the person has a continuing inability to
(2) A person has a continuing inability to work because of an impairment if
the Secretary is satisfied that:
(aa) in a case where the person’s impairment is not a severe
impair-ment within the meaning of subsection (3B)-the person has
particip-ated in a program of support within the meaning of subsection (3C);
(a) in all cases-the impairment is of itself sufficient to prevent the person
from doing any work independently of a program of support
within the next 2
(b) in all cases-either:
(i) the impairment is of itself sufficient to prevent the per-son from
undertaking a training activity during the next 2 years; or
(ii) if the impairment does not prevent the person from un-dertaking a
training activity-such activity is unlikely (because of the
impairment) to
enable the person to do any work independently of a program of support within
the next 2 years. ...
Section 5 of the
Social Security (Requirements and Guidelines-Active
Participation for Disability Support Pension) Determination 2011
Determination’) sets out the requirements for active participation in a
program of support.
Subsection 5(5) of the Determination states:
This subsection is satisfied in relation to a person and a program of support
(a) At the relevant date of claim is participating in the program of support;
(b) The person is prevented solely because of his or her impairment from
improving his or her capacity to find, gain or remain in
employment through
continued participation in the program.
O’Gorman-Watson told the AAT that from about August 2012 her health
deteriorated rapidly and she was no longer able to work.
On 4 October 2012 she
struggled to attend her first interview with Interwork Disability Services
(IDS), a designated support provider.
She was told at that interview she did not
have to attend because she had been ‘suspended by Centrelink’. She
was confused
by the information given to her. She was later advised by IDS that
she was to exit the program. Her condition continued to worsen.
Later in 2013,
IDS informed O’Gorman-Watson that they were closing down, so in September
2013 O’Gorman-Watson volunteered
to attend ORS Employment Solutions (ORS).
O’Gorman-Watson believed she had been suspended from the POS because of
of her impairment on her capacity to work and submitted that the
nature and severity of her condition prevented her from obtaining
any benefits
from these programs. The AAT considered documentary evidence being ARO notes,
IDS file notes and ORS file notes. Consideration
of evidence
The AAT considered that, based on the evidence, it was likely that at the
time of claim O'Gorman-Watson's impairment should have rated
40 points, with 20
points on one table which would meet the defini-tion of a severe impairment.
However, it noted that as no additional
assessment was carried out the AAT had
to assume she did not meet the requirement for ‘severe impairment’.
The Secretary
conceded that at the relevant date O’Gorman-Watson was
participating in a POS. The Tribunal found that given
O’Gorman-Watson’s
severe physical, cognitive and communicative
incapacities, it was unlikely she would benefit from any POS unless it was
to meet her specific needs. There was no evidence that it was. The
Tribunal concluded that during the relevant period O’Gorman-Watson
prevented solely because of her impairment from improving her capacity to find
gain or remain in employment through continued
participation in the POS. She
therefore satisfied s.5 (5) of the Determination and she satisfied s.94 of the
Act and was qualified
Formal decision
The decision was set aside and a decision substituted that at the relevant
time O’Gorman-Watson satisfied s.94 of the Act and
was qualified for DSP.
