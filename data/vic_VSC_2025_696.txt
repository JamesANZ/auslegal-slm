HER HONOUR:
1 The Plaintiff, the Environment
Protection Authority (‘EPA’), commenced this proceeding against the
Defendant, Veolia
Recycling & Recovery Pty Ltd
(ACN 002 902 650) (‘Veolia’), by way of writ and
statement of claim on 28 August 2024.
The Plaintiff sought a pecuniary
penalty, an adverse publicity order, a compensation order and ancillary orders,
in relation to the
contravention of
sections 25(1)
Environment Protection Act 2017
(Vic) (‘EP Act’) between
July 2022 to June 2024 by Veolia.
2 Veolia agreed to
admit to the contraventions of sections 25(1) and 63(1) of the EP Act
and relief on the terms set out in the minute
of proposed consent orders
received by the Court on 7 October
3 Accordingly, the parties jointly seek the
Court’s approval of their respective orders. The parties have provided a
of agreed facts, joint submissions, and have made brief oral
submissions to support the proposed consent
4 I applaud the parties in this matter for
their comprehensive and sensible joint submissions which have been of assistance
5 After hearing the parties through
their counsel and considering the joint submissions and the agreed statements of
facts, I am satisfied
to adopt the joint submissions as my reasoning for my
determination against Veolia.
6 There would be no
utility in the Court discussing at length the facts, law and the application of
the law to the facts, as the joint
submissions provided by the parties and
annexed to these reasons provide exactly that.
the consent of the parties, I annex the joint written submissions as
‘Annexure A’, and the statement of agreed
‘Annexure B’, to this judgment. This will ensure that anyone
who seeks to comprehend the basis for the state
of satisfaction that I have
reached with regard to the admitted contraventions by Veolia and the penalties
that they and the EPA
have agreed to are
appropriate.
8 Consequently, I will provide a brief
summary of the matter below.
9 The EPA is
Victoria’s environmental regulator established under section 356 of
the EP Act. Veolia is a company that was, at
all material times, engaged in the
activity of storage and/or possession of waste at a landfill site situated at
274‑310 Hallam
Road, Hampton Park
(‘Premises’).
10 Veolia was issued with
an operating licence (OL000069939) by the EPA which has been amended from time
to time (the ‘operating
licence’). The operating licence permits
Veolia to operate the Premises in accordance with the conditions set out in the
11 Section 63(1) of the EP Act
provides that ‘[a] person must not breach a condition of a licence issued
to the person’.
Veolia admits that it breached section 63(1) of the
EP Act by failing to comply with the conditions set out in the operating
A summary of the admitted contraventions are:
(a) Between July 2022 and
September 2023, Veolia contravened its operating licence by failing to take all
practicable measures to
prevent emissions of landfill gas from exceeding the
action levels prescribed. Although Veolia did implement several practical
to prevent landfill gas emissions, there were five practical measures
in which Veolia did fail to implement, being to:
(i) have in place
a consolidated document titled ‘risk management and monitoring
program’ as at 15 December
(ii) apply adequate daily cover of waste in the
active cell at the Premises on 28 August
(iii) regularly inspect and maintain landfill
gas wells at the Premises and to repair gas wells in a timely
(iv) develop and implement a Landfill Gas
Remediation Action Plan (‘LFGRAP’) to remedy landfill gas
exceedances at the
Premises; and
(v) undertake two
measures identified in Table 10 of the Defendant’s Environmental
Management Plan dated 29 September 2021 (‘EMP’)
Defendant recorded exceedances of landfill gas at the Hallam Road
Landfill’s perimeter bores, namely:
A. confirm that the compressed air supply to the pneumatic
leachate sumps is working and the system is functioning correctly;
B. assess the risk to neighbouring receptors and undertake additional
monitoring of subsurface infrastructure and buildings.
July 2022 and September 2023, Veolia contravened a condition of its operating
licence concerning the obligation to implement
odour source controls that are
required. Veolia did implement several odour source controls at the Premises but
Veolia failed to
provide adequate daily cover of waste in the active landfill
cell on 28 August 2023, and it failed to develop and implement a LFGRAP
exceedances in landfill gas at the
13 During the period July 2022 to September
2023, the Defendant contravened section 63(1) of the EP Act by failing to
comply with
a condition of the operating licence in that the Defendant failed to
implement the following odour source controls that accord with
the requirements
of section 6.7.3 of the
Best Practice Environment Management, Siting,
Design, Operation and Rehabilitation of Landfills
(EPA publication 788)
(a) provide
adequate daily cover of waste in the active landfill cell at the Premises on 28
August 2023;
(b) develop
a LFGRAP for exceedances in landfill gas at the Premises.
14 On 28 August 2023, Veolia
contravened a condition of its operating licence by failing to apply adequate
daily cover of waste in
the active landfill cell at the
15 Between July 2022 and June 2024, Veolia
contravened a condition of its operating licence by failing to extract leachate
on occasion
from a number of the High
at the Premises such that the
depth of leachate above the lowest point of the drainage layer does not exceed
16 Between January and June 2024, Veolia
contravened a condition of its operating licence by failing to ensure on
occasion that leachate
levels in the Low
at the Premises were
maintained at least one and a half metres lower than the groundwater as measured
at the nearest down gradient
17 During the
period July 2022 to September 2023, the Defendant contravened section 25(1)
of the EP Act by failing to, so far as reasonably
practicable, minimise the risk
of an adverse effect on the amenity of land in the vicinity of the Premises from
landfill gas emissions,
in that the Defendant failed to:
(a) develop
and implement a LFGRAP to remedy landfill gas exceedances at the Hallam Road
(b) undertake
two measures identified in Table 10 of the Defendant’s EMP when the
Defendant recorded exceedances of landfill
gas at the Premises’ perimeter
bores, namely:
(i) confirm that
the compressed air supply to the pneumatic leachate sumps is working and the
system is functioning correctly; and
(ii) assess the
risk to neighbouring receptors and undertake additional monitoring of subsurface
infrastructure and buildings.
18 On the basis of what I have summarised
above, and as more fully developed in the joint submissions based on the
statement of agreed
facts, I am satisfied that:
(a) Veolia contravened
sections 25(1) and 63(1) of the EP Act by causing environmental damage
by exceeding the required levels of
odour and leachate at the Premises.
(b) Pursuant to subsections 332(1) and
332(2)(b) of the EP Act, within 30 days of this order, the Defendant is to
pay an amount of
$1,000,000 into the restorative justice project account
established under section 447 of the EP Act (account details to be provided
by the Plaintiff to the Defendant) for the purpose of funding a restorative
projective or a number of projects benefiting the community
in the vicinity of
the Premises.
(c) Pursuant to section 330(a) of the
EP Act, within 30 days of this order, the Defendant is to publish, at its
own expense, a written
adverse publicity notice (‘Notice’) in the
terms set out in the ‘Annexure’ of the orders in:
immediately visible area of the web address www.anz.veolia.com and in no less
than 12‑point font. The Notice must remain
so published for a period of no
less than 120 days;
WMRR news: newsletter of the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association
(d) Pursuant to section
309(1) of the EP Act (with the consent of the parties under section 311 of
the EP Act), the Defendant is to:
(i) monitor
landfill gas emissions on internal landfill waste batters at the Hallam Road
Landfill for 12 months from the date of these
orders, and if landfill gas
emissions exceed the action limits prescribed in Table 6.4 of the BPEM
(200 ppm) the Defendant must:
A. install sacrificial geomembranes on the Cell 15
internal western batter within 4 months of the batter reaching final height
specified in the auditor verified Cell 15 Filling Plan, and before the
layback on Cell 16 is completed;
B. as soon as reasonably practicable
after an exceedance is identified, prepare and submit to the EPA an individual
remediation action
plan in relation to the relevant exceedance(s);
31 December 2027, provide six monthly reports to the Plaintiff tracking progress
against the following matters relied upon
by the Defendant to manage leachate at
the Landfill during the reporting period (being the six‑month period
immediately prior
to the date of each report):
A. the leachate generation and water balance model outlined in
the Defendant’s Leachate Management Plan (Revision 3, 7 June
2024) or as amended by auditor verification from time to time;
leachate drawdown timeline outlined in the Defendant’s Leachate Management
Plan (Revision 3, 7 June 2024) or as amended
by auditor verification
from time to time;
the first sixth monthly report to be provided within 6 months of this
(iii) by 1 June
2026, provide an auditor verified report via the EPA portal that demonstrates,
based on the available data and water
balance model forecasts, that compliance
with leachate levels required by Condition OL_L4.1 and OL_L4.2.1 can be achieved
by 31 January
2027, or if the current infrastructure and conditions has not
proved capable of reaching a throughput that achieves compliance with
OL_L4.1 and OL_L4.2.1 by 31 January 2027, additional leachate treatment
capacity must be built, with consideration to what
is reasonably practicable, to
expedite leachate levels into compliance.

joint statement of agreed facts and the joint memorandum provided by the parties
are annexed to this judgement. I consider
that it is appropriate to do so and
thus provide a transparent record as to the matters which the parties have
agreed, and to formally
record the matters to which the Court had regard in
forming its satisfaction with the penalty
21 I commend the parties on reaching an
appropriate outcome of this litigation and for assisting the Court and the
community (in particular
the community directly affected by the environmental
contraventions). I acknowledge the approach with which the EPA has undertaken
its regulatory role and in its assistance to the Court in determining an
appropriate penalty. Further, I acknowledge the Defendant
for its acceptance of
the consequences of its actions and in taking appropriate remedial action,
demonstrating contrition, remorse
and insight. The Defendant has taken its
environmental and corporate commitments seriously, including by cooperating with
to bring this litigation to its conclusion.

PARTIES’ JOINT SUBMISSIONS ON AGREED PENALTIES AND
INTRODUCTION
these proceedings, the Environment Protection Authority (
) claims that
Veolia Recycling & Recovery Pty Ltd (
) has breached
a) its operating licence contrary to
Environment
Protection Act 2017
b) the general environmental duty (GED) in s 25(1),
in respect of the operations of its landfill at 274-310 Hallam
Road, Hampton Park (the
Hallam Road Landfill
). By way of relief, the EPA
seeks, among other things, pecuniary penalties and an adverse publicity
joint submissions are made on behalf of the parties concerning the final
disposition of the EPA’s claim in relation to
all issues: liability, final
orders and costs.
for liability, Veolia admits the claim in respect of six claims set out in the
Statement of Claim (
). The extent of Veolia’s admissions is set
out in the proposed findings in the Proposed Order for Final Relief (
) filed with the Court (under the heading “Other
Matters”). The EPA accepts Veolia’s admissions, and the EPA does
press the remaining claims alleged in the SoC.
for final orders (and costs), the parties invite the Court to make each of the
orders set out in the Proposed Orders. The parties
have also filed a Statement
of Agreed Facts (
) upon which they ask the Court to make the Proposed
summary, the Proposed Orders provide for the following:
a) In lieu of a pecuniary penalty for the admitted contraventions, Veolia paying
$1,000,000 into the Restorative Project Account
for the purposes of funding a
restorative project, or several projects, benefiting the community in the
vicinity of the Hallam Road
Landfill (pursuant to s 332(1) and
s 332(2)(b) of the EP Act);
b) An adverse publicity order requiring Veolia to make a publication concerning
the contraventions (pursuant to s 330(a) of the EP
c) An order by consent under s 309(1) and s 311 of the EP Act
requiring Veolia to undertake certain works at the Hallam Road Landfill,
provide reports to the EPA, to address matters concerning the management of
landfill gas and leachate generated at the Hallam
Road Landfill;
d) Veolia to pay the EPA’s costs of the proceeding fixed in the sum of
the reasons which follow, the parties jointly submit that the Proposed Orders
ought to be made. These joint submissions should

admits that it breached s 63(1) of the EP Act by failing to comply with
conditions of its Operating Licence. A summary of the
admitted contraventions is
as follows:
a) Between July 2022 and September 2023, Veolia contravened condition OL_L5 of
its Operating Licence by failing to take all practicable
measures to prevent
emissions of landfill gas from exceeding the action levels prescribed in Table
Best Practice Environment Management, Siting, Design, Operation
and Rehabilitation of Landfills
(EPA publication 788)
Although Veolia took
a number of practicable measures to prevent landfill gas emissions, Veolia
failed to take five practical measures,

monitoring program’ (
) as at 15 December 2022. Veolia did
have other risk-based management and monitoring plans in place at the time.

Veolia has had in place an RMMP verified by its EPA
approved auditor;
apply adequate daily cover of waste in the active cell at the Hallam Road
Landfill on 28 August 2023;
regularly inspect and maintain landfill gas wells at the Hallam Road Landfill
and to repair gas wells in a timely manner. Veolia
has since improved its
inspection, maintenance and repair program including through obtaining expert
advice in relation to managing
landfill gas, making associated updates to its
landfill gas management plan, extensively drilling new gas wells, and redrilling
pre-existing
gas wells to improve extraction
efficiency;

Environmental Management Plan dated 29 September 2021, where landfill
exceeded the action levels in the BPEM (since 15 September 2023).
Veolia’s Environmental Management Plan (
) has now been surpassed
by the RMMP;
b) Between July 2022 and September 2023, Veolia contravened condition OL_A1.1 of
its Operating Licence concerning the obligation
to implement odour source
controls that accord with the requirements of section 6.7.3 of the BPEM.
Veolia did implement several odour
source controls at the Hallam Road Landfill,
but Veolia failed to provide adequate daily cover of waste in the active
landfill cell
on 28 August 2023, and it failed to develop and implement a LFGRAP
for exceedances in landfill gas at the Hallam Road Landfill. As
noted above,
Veolia now has an LFGRAP;
c) On 28 August 2023, Veolia contravened condition OL_L6 of its Operating
Licence by failing to apply adequate daily cover of waste
in the active landfill
cell at the Hallam Road
d) Between July 2022 and June 2024, Veolia contravened condition OL_L4.1 of its
Operating Licence, by failing to extract leachate

THE PROPOSED FINDINGS
parties jointly submit that the Court should make the findings set out in
paragraph [1] under the heading “Other matters”
to record the
contraventions admitted by Veolia.
PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO JOINT
POSITIONS AS TO PECUNIARY PENALTIES
civil penalty proceedings, Courts have recognised the desirability for a Court
to act on a joint position of the parties regarding
the appropriate penalty to
be imposed for the contraventions.
approach was endorsed by French CJ, Kiefel, Bell, Nettle and Gordon JJ in
Commonwealth v Director, Fair Work Building
Inspectorate
who relevantly
In contrast, in civil proceedings there is generally very
considerable scope for the parties to agree on the facts and upon consequences.
There is also very considerable scope for them to agree upon the appropriate
remedy and for the court to be persuaded that it is
an appropriate remedy.
Accordingly, settlements of civil proceedings are commonplace and orders by
consent for the payment of damages
and other relief are unremarkable. So are
court-approved compromises of proceedings on behalf of infants and persons
otherwise lacking
capacity, court‑approved custody and property
settlements, court-approved compromises in group proceedings and
court‑approved
schemes of arrangement. More generally, it is entirely
consistent with the nature of civil proceedings for a court to make orders
consent and to approve a compromise of proceedings on terms proposed by the
parties, provided the court is persuaded that what
is proposed is
appropriate.
Possibly, there are exceptions to the general rule. There is, however, no
reason in principle or practice why civil penalty proceedings
should be treated
as an exception. Subject to the court being sufficiently persuaded of the
accuracy of the parties' agreement as
to facts and consequences, and that the
penalty which the parties propose is an appropriate remedy in the circumstances
thus revealed,
it is consistent with principle and, for the reasons identified
in Allied Mills, highly desirable in practice for the court to accept
parties' proposal and therefore impose the proposed penalty. To do so is no
different in principle or practice from approving
an infant's compromise, a
custody or property compromise, a group proceeding settlement or a scheme of
arrangement.
.... Once it is understood that civil penalties are not retributive, but
like most other civil remedies essentially deterrent or compensatory
therefore protective, there is nothing odd or exceptionable about a court
approving an agreed settlement of a civil proceeding
which involves the public
interest; provided of course that the court is persuaded that the settlement is
appropriate.
parties note that relatively recently this Court, in
Essential Services
Commission v Sumo Power Pty Ltd &
Environment
Protection Authority v Quaker Houghton Australia Pty
followed the approach
established by the High Court.
having regard to a joint proposal on penalty, the Court will not depart from a
penalty figure jointly submitted by the parties
merely because [the
Court] might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure
provided, of course, that the figure advanced falls within a permissible
PROPOSED RESTORATIVE PAYMENT BY VEOLIA IN LIEU OF A PECUNIARY PENALTY
The power to make the order
1 of the Proposed Orders provides for Veolia to make a payment of $1,000,000
into the Restorative Project Account established
and maintained by the EPA under
s 447 of the EP Act. The proposed order is to be made pursuant to
s 332(2) of the EP Act (which is
contained in Division 2 of Part 6 of the
332 provides as follows:
Restorative project orders
may order the person to carry out a project for the restoration or enhancement
environment
in a public
or for the public benefit, whether or not the project is related to the offence
or contravention.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), an order under that subsection may
require the person to pay an amount of money, for the carrying
out of a project
for the restoration or enhancement of the
environment
in a public
or for the public benefit, to—
(a) a specified person or organisation; or
Restorative
Project Account.
order for such a payment under s 332 is sought by the parties in lieu of
the Court ordering payment of a pecuniary penalty under
s 315(1)(a) of the
EP Act. Such a course is permitted under the EP Act.
, sub-s 315(3) provides that nothing in s 315 is to
be construed as limiting any other power of the Court.
, s 327(b) provides that Part 6 of the EP Act (which
includes the restorative project order in s 332) applies in civil
proceedings
if a person is found to have contravened a civil penalty provision.
Sections 25(1) and 63(1) are each civil penalty provisions (see
items 1 and 9 of the Table in s 314 of the EP Act). As such, all
the orders available to the Court in Part 6 of the EP Act are available
the Court in this proceeding.
s 328(1) makes it clear that the Court may impose any
order in Division 2 of Part 6, in addition to,
or instead of
, any penalty
that the Court may impose under the EP Act.
parties jointly submit that the Order 1 of the Proposed Orders is appropriate
for the following reasons.
, the proposed payment is intended to provide direct benefit to
the public (namely, the community within the vicinity of the Hallam
Landfill) having regard to the offsite amenity impacts resulting from landfill
gas odour emanating from the Hallam Road Landfill
during the period of the gas
exceedances. Such an order is consistent with the purpose of restorative
projective orders under s 332
of the EPA Act.
, the quantum of the payment to be made, namely $1,000,000, is
significant and will have significant deterrent value consistent with
primary purpose of the imposition of penalties in civil penalty proceedings. To
the parties’ knowledge, an order of this
magnitude for environmental
matters is unprecedented in Victoria: that is, the parties are unaware of an
order of such a magnitude
having previously been made, whether by way of a
pecuniary penalty or a restorative project order.
s 328(2)(a) of the EP Act states that the amount of money that the Court
may order a person to pay under Division 6 is not
limited by any penalty that
may be imposed under the EP Act, the parties submit that the sum of $1,000,000
proposed by Order 1 likely
exceeds that which would otherwise be ordered by the
Court if a pecuniary penalty were instead to be ordered by the Court for the
contraventions.
this regard, the submissions which follow address key provisions of the EP Act
and the principles relevant to the imposition of
a pecuniary penalty to assist
the Court to determine the appropriateness of Order 1 of the Proposed
Relevant principles and provisions for assessing
penalty proceedings are protective; to deter, not to punish, wrongdoing, with a
view to promoting the public interest in achieving
compliance.
fixing a civil penalty, the Court is concerned with deterrence, that is specific
deterrence of the contravener and general deterrence
of other would‑be
contraveners.
Minister for the Environment v
the Court provided a
detailed explanation of the role and importance of specific and general
deterrence in environmental cases which
can be summarised as follows:
a) To make wrongdoers “think twice” and decide not to act against
the “strong public interest” in properly
maintaining the
environment;
b) The cost and difficulties of enforcement of any environment protection law,
from detection, through to investigation and on to
commencing and conducting
civil penalty proceedings make specific and general deterrence of particular
importance;
c) The more difficult detection and enforcement is, the greater the sanction
required to make the risk/benefit equation less palatable
for the potential
d) Those who voluntarily comply should see those that do not are appropriately
dealt with;
e) Where breaches depend on a degree of contemplation and choice, the right
decision will more likely be made where the sanction
is substantial relative to
the possible gain of non-compliance.
fixing the level of a pecuniary penalty, the Court must have regard to the
maximum imposed by the legislature in the first
Markarian v The
the High Court
...careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required,
first because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly,
because they
invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court
at the time; and thirdly, because in
that regard they do provide, taken and
balanced with all of the other relevant factors, a yardstick.
maximum penalty for a contravention of s 25(1) and s 63(1) by a body corporate
is 10,000 penalty units. The value of a penalty
unit between:
a) 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023 was
b) 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024 was
such, the maximum pecuniary penalty ranged between $1,849,200 (1 July 2022
to 30 June 2023) and $1,923,100 (1 July 2023 and 30
at an appropriate penalty involves an instinctive synthesis of all relevant
This involves a
weighing together of all matters relevant to achieving deterrence by a reasoned
and transparent process.
315(2) of the EP Act provides that, for the purposes of determining the amount
of a civil penalty order, the Court may
have regard to “any relevant
matter” including the following:
(a) the nature and extent of the conduct constituting the
contravention;
(b) the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the
conduct including the cost of remedying any harm;
(c) the circumstances in which the contravention took place;
(d) whether the person who contravenes a civil penalty provision had
previously contravened a civil penalty provision;
(e) any enforceable undertaking that is accepted by the Authority in relation
to the conduct.
322(2) of the EP Act provides that a person is not liable to pay more than one
civil penalty in relation to the same conduct
and reflects the well- established
principle against double counting the same conduct when imposing penalties
across different breaches.
the course of conduct principle is also to be applied and is reflected in
s 323 of the EP Act which permits the Court to
impose a single civil
penalty for multiple contraventions of a civil penalty provision if the multiple
contraventions are based on
the same facts or they form, or are part of, a
series of contraventions of the same or similar nature.
the Court is to make any adjustment to a pecuniary penalty imposed having regard
to the totality principle. The totality principle
is a “final check to be
applied to ensure that a final, total or aggregate, penalty is not unjust or out
of proportion to the
circumstances of the
appropriateness of the $1,000,000 payment in this case
parties submit that the following factors point to the appropriateness of the
quantum of the restorative project payment, in lieu
of a pecuniary penalty, in
this proceeding.
Landfill Gas and Odour contraventions
in compliance with the Operating Licence, notified the EPA of the exceedances of
landfill gas in contravention of condition
OL_L5 of its Operating
nature of the breaches of the conditions concerning landfill gas (OL_L5) and
odour management (OL_A1.1) is that Veolia failed
to take all practicable
measures (namely, those identified in its admissions) as required by OL_L5 and
each of the odour source controls
required by OL_A1.1 (identified in its
admissions).
Veolia admits it failed to take all practicable measures, it is relevant, for
the purpose of determining penalty, to note
Veolia did implement other
practicable measures and odour source controls as acknowledged in the
Court should also consider that Veolia has, during and since the relevant period
for the breaches of the EP Act, undertaken a
range of remedial measures
described in the SOAF.
Veolia has consented to orders requiring it to undertake further measures to
remedy its contraventions of the EP
impact of Veolia’s breaches of these licence conditions is relevant to the
Court’s assessment of penalty. Until October
2023, the EPA received many
community reports complaining about offsite odour from the Hallam Road
EPA officers also
observed offsite odours typically associated with landfill gas on 21 April
2023 and between July and September
offsite landfill gas odour has occurred in connection with Veolia’s
breaches of conditions OL_L5 and OL_A1.1 of its Operating
Licence resulting in
an adverse impact on the amenity of land within the vicinity of the Hallam Road
EPA does not allege
any other form of harm to the environment or human health other than an adverse
impact on amenity.
precise consequence of Veolia’s breaches of conditions OL_L5 and OL_A1.1
of its Operating Licence is difficult to ascertain.
There were other factors at
the time, outside of Veolia’s control, which contributed to the egress of
odour and associated
offsite amenity impacts:
a) As McDonald J found in
in relation to
the same period of time as the EPA’s claim in this proceeding, landfill
gas was escaping from Cells 12 and 13
due to fault in the design and
construction of the cells, which faults were not attributable to Veolia and did
not constitute a breach
by Veolia of its licence or the GED;
b) Further, Veolia has recently had its operations at the Hallam Road Landfill
audited for the period July 2022 to June 2024 by an
EPA approved auditor
(Operations Audit Report). The Operations Audit Report found there was a
noticeable decline in odour complaints
once Veolia covered the drainage layer of
Cell 14 with waste at the end of August 2023 and when a sacrificial
geomembrane barrier
was applied to the sidewall drainage layer for
Cells 11, 12 and 13.
took action to deal with the issue of odour at the Hallam Road Landfill as set
out in the SOAF.
Leachate level contraventions
in compliance with the Operating Licence, also notified the EPA of the
exceedances concerning leachate levels (conditions
OL_L4.1 and
OL_L4.2.1).
Court should have regard to the fact that there are historical factors,
predating the introduction of the EP Act and dating back
to 2019, which explain
why Veolia has experienced considerable difficulty in achieving compliance with
the two leachate level conditions.
Veolia has been, and remains, limited in its
capability to extract, treat and dispose of leachate so as to achieve compliance
its operating licence due to:
a) the capacity constraints of its leachate management and treatment system;
b) the lack of an available market to accept leachate of the type generated by
the Hallam Road Landfill for
has sought and obtained expert evidence in relation to managing this leachate
compliance issue. Veolia has been working towards
minimising any risk of harm to
human health and the environment as reasonably practicable through a range of
measures, including
a) updating its leachate management infrastructure which includes new and
reconfigured infrastructure;
b) developing and implementing its Leachate Management Plan, which includes a
draw down timeline that Veolia is working towards to
bring itself into
compliance with the leachate level
conditions.
Court will also note that the parties jointly submit that the Court should make
a further order, Proposed Order 3, under s 309(1)
and s 311 of the EP
Act, which further addresses the issue of non-compliance by Veolia with
conditions OL_L4.1 and OL_L4.2.1 of the
Cooperation
Court should have regard to Veolia’s cooperation in making admissions and
resolving the proceedings at an early
including the fact that
it made several admissions in its Defence. Veolia self-reported licence breaches
at the earliest opportunity
(which it was required to do by its Operating
Veolia’s early
admissions and the action it has taken to remedy the contraventions demonstrates
contrition, insight and remorse.
resolving the proceeding, the resources of both the Court and the regulator are
freed up. This demonstrates a willingness on the
part of Veolia to facilitate
the course of justice and should be considered for the purposes of moderating
counting, course of conduct and totality principles
fixing any pecuniary penalty, the Court would be required to have regard to
ss 322(2) and 323 of the EP Act, and the totality principle.
parties sought a pecuniary penalty for any of these breaches, the application of
section 322(2) and 323 as well as the application
of the course of conduct
principle (generally) and the totality principle would have resulted in a
significant moderation to the
number of penalties to be imposed as well as the
aggregate amount.
Conclusion on the proposed payment
into account all of the above, the parties jointly submit that the proposed
payment of $1,000,000 can be regarded by the Court
appropriate
amount to be paid by Veolia into the Restorative Project Account (see paragraph
] above). Considering the double
counting, course of conduct and totality principles, as well as the factors
concerning the nature
and impact of the contraventions, and the steps taken by
Veolia to remediate the contraventions, the parties jointly submit that
an appropriate amount, such that it should not be departed from. As the parties
have submitted, the amount is unprecedented
in Victoria for environmental
matters. It is also relevant to bear in mind the entire package of orders
proposed, including the findings
sought to be made and the adverse publicity
order being made, both of which further contribute to the object of
deterrence.
THE PROPOSED ADVERSE PUBLICITY ORDER
parties also submit that it is appropriate for the Court to make the adverse
publicity order under s 330 of the EP Act as proposed
by Proposed Order
330 provides:
may order the person to do one or more of the following—
(a) take any specified action that the
considers reasonably necessary to publicise—
(i) the person's offence or contravention; or
(ii) any impacts on
environment
or other consequences arising or resulting from the offence or contravention;
(iii) any penalties imposed, or other orders made, as a result of the
commission of the offence or contravention; and
(iv) any additional information the
considers appropriate;
(b) take any specified action that the
considers reasonably necessary to notify a specified person or class of person
of the matters listed in paragraph (a).
proposed adverse publicity order is set out in Annexure A to the Proposed
Orders. The publication requirement requires Veolia
to publish the notice in an
immediately visible area of its website for a minimum period of 120 days
(four months) and an industry
publication. As for the content of the
proposed publication, the Court can be satisfied that it complies with the
requirements of
s 330 of the EP Act as it provides for an accurate summary
of the contraventions, impacts on the environment and the orders proposed
PROPOSED CONSENT ORDER REQUIRING VEOLIA TO TAKE CERTAIN
309(1) of the EP Act provides that the Court may make an order requiring a
person to take any specific action in such terms
as the Court considers
appropriate and section 311 provides that the Court can that order of all
parties in the proceeding give their
Proposed Order 3, the parties submit that, by consent, it is appropriate for the
Court to also make an order requiring Veolia to:
a) undertake monitoring of landfill gas emissions on internal landfill waste
batters at the Hallam Road Landfill for 12 months from
the date of the
orders and if landfill gas emissions exceed the action limits prescribed in
Table 6.4 of the BPEM (200 parts per
million) Veolia
sacrificial geomembranes on the Cell 15 internal western batter within
4 months of the batter reaching final height as specified
in the auditor
verified Cell 15 Filling Plan, and before the layback on Cell 16 is
soon as reasonably practicable after an exceedance is identified, prepare and
submit to the EPA an individual remediation action
plan in relation to the
relevant exceedance(s);
b) until 31 December 2027, provide six monthly reports to the EPA tracking
progress against the following matters relied upon by
Veolia to manage leachate
at the Hallam Road Landfill during the reporting period (being the six-month
period immediately prior to
the date of each report):
leachate generation and water balance model outlined in the Defendant’s
Leachate Management Plan (Revision 3, 7 June 2024)
or as amended by
auditor verification from time to time;
leachate drawdown timeline outlined in the Defendant’s Leachate Management
Plan (Revision 3, 7 June 2024) or as amended
by auditor verification
from time to time,
with the first sixth monthly report to be provided within 6 months
of this order;
1 June 2026 provide an auditor verified report via the EPA portal that
demonstrates, based on the available data and water balance
model forecasts,
that compliance with leachate levels required by Condition OL_L4.1 and OL_L4.2.1
can be achieved by 31 January 2027,
or if the current infrastructure and
conditions has not proved capable of reaching a throughput that achieves
compliance with Condition
OL_L4.1 and OL_L4.2.1 by 31 January 2027,
additional leachate treatment capacity must be built, with consideration to what
is reasonably
practicable, to expedite leachate levels into
compliance.
parties submit that such an order is appropriate because it:
a) provides a regime, in addition to the requirements of the Operating Licence,
to deal with landfill gas emissions (if they were
to arise); and
b) further strengthens the measures Veolia has in place to bring itself into
compliance with the conditions OL_4.1 and OL_4.2.1 of
the Operating
will be provided with reports concerning Veolia’s compliance and key
matters which may impact on the generation and management
of leachate at the
Hallam Road Landfill; and
will be auditor verification by 1 June 2026 that compliance with the two
conditions can be achieved by 31 January 2027, failing
which there is a
requirement for additional leachate treatment capacity to be built, with
consideration as to what is reasonably
practicable, to expedite leachate levels
into compliance.
the parties invite the Court to make the agreed order in relation to costs.
Costs follow the event and there is no reason

PROPOSED ADVERSE PUBLICITY ORDER
EMISSIONS OF ODOUR FROM HALLAM ROAD LAND FILL IN 2022 AND
The Supreme Court of Victoria has ordered Veolia Recycling & Recovery
Pty Ltd to publish this adverse publicity notice.
The Supreme Court of Victoria has ordered Veolia Recycling & Recovery Pty
) to pay $1 million into a restorative justice project
account, established under the
Environment Protection Act 2017
), to fund a project or a series of projects benefiting the
community in the vicinity of the Hallam Road Landfill located at
Hallam Road in Hampton Park.
Veolia consented to the making of the order after admitting to:
various breaches
of its operating licence; and
comply with its general environmental duty, owed under section 25 of the EP Act,
to minimise, so far as reasonably practicable,
the risk of landfill gas
emissions adversely affecting the amenity of land, in the vicinity of the Hallam
Road Landfill.
In 2022 and 2023 EPA received complaints from the
public about odour believed to have been emitted from the Hallam Road Landfill.
Veolia admits that it failed to comply with certain conditions of its operating
licence which included, among other things, a requirement
that it take certain
reasonably practicable measures to prevent landfill gas emissions from exceeding
levels prescribed in the Best
Practice Environment Management, Siting, Design,
Operation, and Rehabilitation of Landfills (Environment Protection Authority
Publication
788) and maintain leachate below levels stipulated in the operating
licence. Veolia accepts that it breached its general environmental
failing to do all things reasonably practicable to minimise the risk of landfill
gas emissions adversely affecting the amenity
of land nearby, including
developing a Landfill Gas Remediation Action Plan and managing the risk that
landfill gas posed to its
neighbours.
An EPA-approved independent auditor has prepared an Operations Audit Report
that covers the majority of the relevant period. The Report
noted that Veolia
has made improvements to its management of the site, and found that the active
landfill cell is now unlikely to
be a significant odour source provided it is
operated in accordance with the management framework currently in place at the
Veolia has co-operated with the EPA in its investigation and throughout this
proceeding, expressed remorse for its contraventions,
undertaken substantial
works to improve its leachate management infrastructure, and also consented to
orders requiring it to undertake
certain activities to further improve
regulatory compliance at the Hallam Road Landfill. Veolia has also agreed to
contribute $75,000
to EPA’s legal costs.

many community reports complaining about odour the reporter claimed to be from
the Hallam Road Landfill. The number
of reports was approximately 1,348.
landfill gas odour emitted from the Hallam Road Landfill had an adverse impact
on the amenity of land within the vicinity of the
Hallam Road Landfill.
21 April 2023 EPA authorised officers conducted odour surveys of areas where
members of the public had complained of offensive
odour. Those authorised
officers detected offensive odour. The observations of the authorised officers
were recorded in field activity
report numbered FAR- 00010440. A copy of the
report appears at page 69 of Annexure C.
July and September 2023 authorised officers conducted targeted odour inspections
of areas where odour reports had been received.
Those authorised officers
detected offensive odour. The observations of the authorised officers are
summarised in an odour surveillance
summary report. A copy of the report appears
at pages 70 to 76 of Annexure C.
Exceedances in
levels of landfill gas
month, from about July 2022 to September 2023, Veolia notified EPA that landfill
gas at the Hallam Road Landfill exceeded the
Action Levels in several landfill
gas wells. A bundle of notifications sent by Veolia and received by EPA appears
at pages 77 to
218 of Annexure C.
Exceedances

(b) Between January to June 2024, Veolia notified EPA that the depth of leachate
in cells 1 to 3 and 6 (the
) exceeded the
Groundwater Level Requirement.
A bundle of notifications sent by Veolia and received by EPA appears at
pages 219 to 431 of Annexure C.
Measures to manage landfill gas
6 of the BPEM enumerates a range of measures that can be implemented by landfill
operators to prevent emissions of landfill
gas from exceeding the Action Levels.
Those measures include (among other things):
(a) daily covering of waste;
(b) a site-specific landfill gas risk assessment;
(c) development of a landfill gas remediation plan for exceedances in landfill
(d) development, installation, and maintenance of a leachate collection system
appropriate to the landfill.
Veolia’s failure to implement all practicable measures to manage
landfill gas
July 2022 and September 2023, although Veolia implemented several practicable
measures, as required by Condition OL_L5, and
several odour source controls as
required by Condition OL_A1.1, Veolia did not implement all practicable measures
and all odour source
controls which could have been implemented.
(a) did not have in place an auditor-verified version of a document titled
‘Risk Management and Monitoring Plan’ (
15 September 2023, although it had in place a plan which was risk-based and
contained monitoring measures to reduce the risk
of harm to human health and the
environment at the landfill from at least around 2016; and
(b) did not develop a landfill gas remediation action plan for exceedances in
landfill gas at the Hallam Road Landfill until 31 October
2023, although it
began developing one from October 2023, which was ultimately verified by the
independent environmental auditor
in May 2024.
28 August 2023, EPA officers inspected the Hallam Road Landfill and observed
areas of waste in the active landfill that did not
have adequate cover. A copy
of that report appears at page 432 of Annexure C.
July 2022 and September 2023, Veolia did not regularly inspect and maintain
certain landfill gas wells at the Hallam Road
Landfill. Nor did Veolia repair
gas wells within a timely manner.
landfill gas exceeded the Action Levels, Veolia failed to undertake two measures
identified in Table 10 of Veolia’s Environmental
Management Plan
(a) prior to March 2023, Veolia failed to confirm that the compressed air supply
to the pneumatic leachate sumps was working, and
the system was functioning;
(b) prior to the auditor verification of the RMMP on 15 September 2023, Veolia
failed to assess the risk to neighbouring receptors
and undertake additional
monitoring of subsurface infrastructure and buildings.
provided monitoring data to its auditor at yearly or two-yearly intervals to
receive advice about risk and any further monitoring
and management required
instead of undertaking a unique assessment of the risk to neighbouring receptors
and additional monitoring
of subsurface infrastructure and buildings for each
discrete exceedance detected.
Veolia’s breaches of the
breached the following conditions of the Licence:
(a) Between July 2022 and September 2023, Condition OL_L5, by failing to take
all practicable measures (being the measures described
in paragraphs 20
to 24 above) to prevent emissions of landfill gas exceeding the Action
Levels (as described above at paragraph 17
of the SOAF);
(b) Between July 2022 and September 2023, Condition OL_A1.1, by failing to
implement the odour source controls of:
adequate daily cover on 28 August 2023 (as described above at paragraph 22 of
the SOAF); and
a landfill gas remediation action plan for exceedances in landfill gas (as
described above at paragraph 21(b) of the SOAF);
(c) On 28 August 2023, Condition OL_L6, by failing to apply adequate daily cover
of waste in the active landfill cell at the Hallam
Road Landfill (as described
above at paragraph 22 of the SOAF);
(d) Between August 2022 and June 2024, Condition OL_L4.1, by failing to extract
leachate from several High Cells to ensure that the
depth of leachate in the
High Cells did not exceed the 300mm Requirement (as described above at paragraph
18(a) of the SOAF); and
(e) Between January and June 2024, Condition OL_L4.2.1, by failing to maintain
leachate levels in the Low Cells below the Groundwater
Level (as described above
at paragraph 18(b) of the SOAF).
Veolia’s breach of the General Environmental Duty
the period July 2022 and September 2023, Veolia breached the General
Environmental Duty (GED) it owed under section 25(1) of
the EP Act by:
(a) failing to have a Landfill Gas Remediation Action Plan; and
(b) failing to undertake two measures identified in Table 10 of Veolia’s
EMP when Veolia recorded exceedances of landfill gas
at the Hallam Road Landfill
perimeter bores as follows:
March 2023, Veolia failed to confirm that the compressed air supply to the
pneumatic leachate sumps was working and the system
was functioning correctly;
15 September 2023 (when the auditor verified the RMMP), Veolia failed to assess
the risk to neighbouring receptors and undertake
additional monitoring of
subsurface infrastructure and buildings.
measures in the preceding paragraph, of this SOAF, were each reasonably
practicable measures available to minimise the risk of
an adverse effect on the
amenity of land within the vicinity of the Hallam Road Landfill from the
emission of offensive landfill
gas odours from the Hallam Road Landfill.
the breaches outlined in paragraph 27, the Landfill Gas Remediation Action Plan
commenced in October 2023, which was ultimately
verified by the independent
environmental auditor in May 2024.
Further circumstances of
the contravening conduct
the relevant period, the landfill gas odour detected offsite was materially
contributed to by a combination of factors being:
(a) Veolia’s non-compliance with Conditions OL_L5 and OL_A1.1 of its
Licence (as referred to above at 25(a) and 25(b) of the
(b) the design of Cells 11, 12 and 13 were verified by an EPA appointed auditor
and relied on by Veolia.
EPA approved independent auditor has prepared an Operations Audit Report for the
Hallam Road Landfill dated 1 April 2025 (
Operations Audit Report
The Operations Audit Report concerns the audit period 1 July 2022 to
30 June 2024, thus overlapping with the majority of the Relevant
Relevantly, the Operations Audit Report finds that:
(a) landfill gas emissions did not result in any unacceptable risk of landfill
gas hazard, and that landfill gas emissions continue
to be monitored and managed
(b) the leachate levels are being managed and monitored by Veolia by the
implementation of its auditor verified Leachate Management
Plan and the
introduction of new and reconfigured infrastructure and other measures,
south boundary leachate holding/pre-treatment ponds completed in April
reconfiguration
of the treatment system, following a review completed by Veolia, which is aimed
at improving treatment and discharge
rates. Pond 1 is now used as a
dedicated first stage treatment pond which flows into Pond 2 for a second
stage of treatment. There
will further augmentation of the system by the
construction of two 1.75ML holding/discharge tanks (to be commissioned prior to
commissioning of Cell 15);
(c) the spike in odour complaints reduced from October 2023;
(d) Veolia has in place an RMMP and a range of other operational and risk based
documents to manage the landfill; and Veolia as operator
generally met its
requirements under the Licence for environmental management and monitoring over
the audit period. The 2021 update
of the Hydrogeological Assessment and the
broader risk framework for the Hallam Road Landfill that was reassessed to
inform a recent
update to the RMMP in 2025 are both considered to provide an
appropriate assessment of the risk context of the Hallam Road Landfill,
report makes no other recommendations in relation to operation of the Hallam
Road Landfill.
the Operations Audit Report also found there was a noticeable decline in odour
complaints once Veolia covered the drainage
layer of Cell 14 with waste at
the end of August 2023 and when a sacrificial geomembrane barrier was applied to
the sidewall drainage
layer for Cells 11, 12 and 13.
significant reduction in complaints is so despite leachate level exceedances
still occurring. Leachate level management and extraction
system improvements
have been implemented and are ongoing at the site in accordance with the
Leachate Management Plan verified in
June 2024, and the measures proposed in
order 3 of the order for final relief (see Annexure A). For the period
2019 to present, Veolia
states capital leachate infrastructure investment is
approximately $2.1 million.
relation to the self-reported exceedances related to leachate levels at the
Hallam Road Landfill in terms of compliance with Conditions
OL_L4.1 and
OL_L4.2.1 of the Licence, while compliance was not achieved, Veolia’s
approach to addressing this issue was informed
by the EPA-approved independent
auditor statement in the 12 February 2021 verification of the Hydrogeological
Assessment that:
“At this point the greatest environmental
risk at the site appears to relate to odour management. The Auditor concludes
managing the risk of odour from the leachate pond and pre-treatment system
should be prioritised over targeting rapid reductions
in cell leachate heads,
particularly in the newer cells where leachate remains acetogenic. It is clear
from the HA findings that
the leachate currently remaining in the cells above
compliance levels poses relatively little risk to the groundwater environment.
It is the Auditor’s opinion that it makes little sense to prioritise rapid
leachate level reduction simply to reach “compliance”
potential associated odour issues that accompany this approach. Instead, a
steady, managed approach to leachate extraction,
pre- treatment and discharge
that avoids occurrences of offsite nuisance odour to the extent practicable is a
lower risk strategy
Historical context for leachate non-compliances prior to Relevant
to the Relevant Period, relevant historical context that led to Veolia
experiencing considerable difficulty in achieving compliance
with leachate level
conditions, included:
(a) Veolia experiencing a significant reduction in leachate treatment capacity
in around 2019, in connection with the decommissioning
of two treatment ponds
due to the construction of a new landfill cell;
(b) the lack of an available offsite market to accept leachate of the type
generated by the Hallam Road Landfill; and
(c) Veolia taking various actions in an effort to prevent leachate levels from
becoming non-compliant, including:
around 2019 and 2020, Veolia applying to the EPA, and obtaining, an emergency
approval to enable leachate to be transferred to
the Taylors Road landfill for
treatment and discharge to the extent practicable;

measures have included:
(a) since October 2023 developing a Landfill Gas Remediation Action Plan
verified by an independent environmental auditor in May
(b) engaging a third party contractor, LMS, to inspect and maintain gas wells,
and extract landfill gas, on a monthly basis;
(c) engaging a third party contractor to update its gas extraction
infrastructure to improve efficiency of landfill gas extraction
including, from
the period since January 2022 to the date of this SOAF:
at least 82 new gas wells;
28 pre-existing gas wells; and
(d) holding monthly meetings with relevant stakeholders, including members of
the community, regarding operations at the Hallam Road
Landfill and initiatives
to address any matters of concern raised.
Veolia accepts that it breached the GED and certain conditions of its Operating
Licence, as outlined above, it did undertake
the following actions:
(a) extracting, treating and disposing of leachate as far as practicable, having
regard to the risk and constraints identified in
paragraphs 34‑35 above of
(b) in around 2022, applying to the EPA for, and obtaining, an emergency
approval to enable some of the leachate to be transferred
to the Taylors Road
landfill for treatment and discharge until 30 January 2023; and
(c) seeking out expert advice concerning leachate management, including the
preparation of leachate management plans (which includes
a leachate) drawdown
table for Veolia to work towards to bring itself into compliance with the
Licence) and implementing the plans
to the extent practicable.
