applicant’s submissions, to which no issue was taken by
the respondents.
It accurately reflects the scheme. The summary below is obviously not exhaustive
but addresses some aspects of the
scheme relevant to this proceeding.
objects of the NDIS Act are identified in s 3. They relevantly include:
promoting the provision of high quality and innovative
supports that enable
people with disability to maximise independent lifestyles and full inclusion in
the community (s 3(1)(g)); and
protecting and preventing people with disability
from experiencing harm arising from poor quality or unsafe supports or services
provided under the NDIS (s 3(1)(ga)).
3(2) provides that the objects of the NDIS Act are to be achieved by, inter
alia, establishing a national regulatory framework
for persons and entities who
provide supports and services to people with disability.
4 of the NDIS Act contains a number of general principles to guide actions under
the Act. For present purposes, it is sufficient
to note the following general
principles:
(a) people with disability have the same right as other members of society to
realise their potential for physical, social, emotional
and intellectual
development (s 4(1));
(b) people with disability and their families and carers should have certainty
that people with disability will receive the care
and support they need over
their lifetime (s 4(3));
(c) people with disability have the same right as other members of Australian
society to respect for their worth and dignity and
to live free from abuse,
neglect and exploitation (s 4(6));
(d) people with disability have the same right as other members of society to
pursue any grievance (s 4(7)); and
(e) in exercising their right to choice and control, people with disability
require access to a diverse and sustainable market for
disability supports in
which innovation, quality, continuous improvement, contemporary best practice
and effectiveness in the provision
of supports to people with disability are to
be promoted (s 4(15)).
NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission (the Commission) is established under s
181A of the NDIS Act. The Commissioner’s
functions and powers are
identified in s 181D and include certain core functions in s 181E. The first of
the Commissioner’s
core functions in s 181E(a) is to uphold the
rights of, and promote the health, safety and wellbeing of, people with
disability receiving
supports or services, including those received under the
NDIS. The Commissioner’s core functions also include securing compliance
with the NDIS Act through effective compliance and enforcement arrangements,
including through monitoring and investigation functions
conferred by Division 8
of Part 3A of Chapter 4 (s 181E(d)). Further, s 181F provides the
Commissioner’s registration and reportable
incident functions including:
monitoring NDIS provider compliance with their conditions of registration (s
181F(c)); notification
and management of reportable incidents conferred on the
Commissioner (s 181F(e)); and collating and analysing in relation to
incidents to identify trends or systemic issues (s 181F(g)).
s 181D(2), the Commissioner may, by notifiable instrument, make guidelines
relating to the performance of any of their functions
mentioned in s 181D(1).
Section 209 of the NDIS Act supplies the Minister with the power, by legislative
instrument, to make rules
called the “National Disability Insurance Scheme
rules” (NDIS Rules).
73F(1) of the NDIS Act provides that the registration of a person as a
registered NDIS provider is subject to certain conditions
specified in s 73F(2).
Relevantly, that includes for Lifestyle Solutions to comply with:
(a) all applicable requirements of the NDIS Code of Conduct (s 73F(2)(b));
(b) all applicable standards and other requirements of the NDIS Practice
Standards (s 73F(2)(c)).
73J of the NDIS Act provides that a person contravenes that section if they are
a registered NDIS provider and breach a condition
of their registration.
NDIS Code of Conduct
NDIS Code of Conduct is contained within Part 2 of the
National Disability
Insurance Scheme (Code of Conduct) Rules 2018
(Cth) (Code of Conduct Rules),
which was made for the purposes of s 73V of the NDIS Act: see Code of Conduct
Rules s 5(1). At all
material times, Lifestyle Solutions and Ms Edwards were
required to comply with the NDIS Code of Conduct because they were both a
“Code-covered person” within the meaning of s 5(2) of the Code of
Conduct Rules. The conduct required of them in providing
supports or services to
people with disability is set out within s 6 of the NDIS Code of Conduct. If a
person fails to comply with
a requirement under the NDIS Code of Conduct, they
contravene s 73V(3) of the NDIS Act.
NDIS Practice Standards
NDIS Practice Standards are set out in schedules to the
National Disability
Insurance Scheme (Provider Registration and Practice Standards) Rules 2018
(Cth) (NDIS Practice Standard Rules). They were made under and apply for the
purpose of s 73T of the NDIS Act in providing standards
concerning the quality
of supports or services to be provided by registered NDIS providers:
s 73T(1). As part of Lifestyle Solutions’
provision of services to
assist with daily personal activities and daily life tasks in a group or shared
living arrangement, it was
required to comply with the standards set out in sch
1 of the NDIS Practice Standard Rules.
Factual overview
is unnecessary to repeat all the detail of the factual basis and context in
which the contraventions occurred, which is detailed
in the agreed facts. The
following only provides a very brief overview. It is necessary to consider the
detailed agreed facts (see
Appendix A) to appreciate the full nature and import
of the conduct the subject of these proceedings.
the Relevant Period, Lifestyle Solutions operated a supported accommodation
facility at 1/32-34 Hakone Road, Woongarrah, New
South Wales (Hakone House).
There were five residents with disabilities who resided at Hakone House during
the Relevant Period: Ms
Leicester, AT, MC, SB and GT (Residents). Each of
the Residents was a funded NDIS participant, was incapable of living
independently
and required constant care and supervision.
the Relevant Period, there were 47 incidents of physical aggression (including
injuries) at Hakone House. Of the 47 incidents,
18 constituted contravening
conduct, with the other 30 identified as contextual incidents. The incidents
concerned the conduct of
AT (36 incidents) and MC (11 incidents) towards
the Residents, primarily Ms Leicester, or the support workers.
summary, the acts occurred in either Hakone House or in the car while
transporting MC and Ms Leicester to and from their day program.
The conduct of
AT involved, inter alia: physical aggression towards the Residents, primarily Ms
Leicester, and support workers by
biting, pinching, pulling hair, or grabbing
body parts; damaging property in Hakone House; and AT banging or hitting her
head, screaming
or crying. The conduct of MC involved, inter alia: throwing
items at support workers; damaging property in Hakone House; physical
towards one of the Residents or support workers by kicking, hitting, pinching or
grabbing hair/body parts; spitting; and
grunting, crying or yelling. Some of the
conduct required support workers to remove themselves and the Residents from
Hakone House
or lock themselves in a room for some time. On two occasions, Ms
Leicester was taken toAsee a GP for her injuries.
Solutions knew of each of the incidents within about 24 hours of the incident in
question. Each of those matters was recorded
by Lifestyle Solutions in its
“Riskman” reporting system, among other places. Ms Edwards knew of
AT incidents 1 to 36
within about 1 to 3 days of the incident in question.
facts about Ms Leicester, AT and MC known by Lifestyle Solutions and Ms Edwards
provide relevant context to their admissions
in respect of the management of the
Residents and Hakone House. Those facts include:
(a) Ms Leicester is a woman who has cerebral palsy, intellectual disability,
epilepsy, vision impairment, mild dysphagia, autism,
and sensory processing
dysfunction. She requires support in most aspects of her daily personal
activities and life tasks, where she
is non-verbal, and communicates through
noises and signing. Ms Leicester was between 28 and 30 years old at the time of
the incidents.
(b) AT is a woman who has intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, epilepsy,
autism, conditions affecting her eyesight and is largely
non-verbal. AT has a
propensity to engage in, amongst others: biting and hitting support workers and
other residents; being impatient
with others, and “lashing out”;
self-harming through banging her head and pinching; and property damage when
frustrated.
AT was physically larger and stronger than Ms Leicester. From 29
October 2021 (after the Relevant Period), AT was subject to an authorised
restrictive practice by installing a door to divide AT’s area of Hakone
House from the rest of the house.
(c) MC is a man who has autism spectrum disorder (Level 3), Angelman Syndrome,
intellectual disability, anxiety, intermittent explosive
outbursts and has a
severe speech impairment. MC has a propensity to engage in: physical aggression,
including hitting, kicking,
spitting or punching; placing others in headlocks;
throwing items; and aggressive behaviours during car travel, including grabbing
hold of others and pulling others’ hair. MC was physically larger and
stronger than Ms Leicester. During the Relevant Period,
MC was subject to an
authorised restrictive practice when in the car by installing a partial barrier
between MC and other passengers
and the driver.
Leicester, AT and MC were also subject to a series of Behaviour Support Plans by
Lifestyle Solutions to address general support
strategies and proactively
prevent challenging behaviours from occurring and escalating.
summary of the contraventions admitted by the respondents (with the relevant
maximum penalty) was provided by the Commissioner and
is attached to these
reasons as Appendix B.
Solutions admit 96 contraventions in total. In summary, Lifestyle Solutions
admit that in breach of Sch 1 of the NDIS Practice
Standards, it failed
(a) allow Ms Leicester or MC to access the supports provided by Lifestyle
Solutions free from violence on 12 occasions (cl 7);
(b) allow Ms Leicester, MC or one of the Residents to access the supports
provided by Lifestyle Solutions in a safe environment due
to being injured or at
a real risk of injury and/or at risk of a more serious injury on 14 occasions
(c) adequately respond to and manage risks of physical aggression and injury
posed to the Residents and support workers at Hakone
House by AT and MC on 11
occasions, including by failing to take reasonable steps to eliminate or
minimise such risks (cl 10); and
(d) safeguard Ms Leicester from physical aggression by AT and MC by means of its
incident management system, and failed to ensure
earlier incidents were
acknowledged, responded to, well-managed and learned from on 5 occasions (cl
admitted breaches of the NDIS Practice Standards give rise to 47 contraventions
of s 73J of the NDIS Act.
Solutions also admit that in breach of the NDIS Code of Conduct, it failed
(a) provide the supports and services to the Residents in a safe and competent
manner with care and skill given the incidents involving
physical aggression by
AT and MC on 11 occasions (s 6(1)(c));
(b) promptly take steps to raise and act on concerns about matters relating to
AT’s and MC’s physical aggression towards
the Residents and support
workers (including earlier incidents of such conduct and the risks posed by
them) that may impact the quality
and safety of supports and services provided
to the Residents at Hakone House on 11 occasions (s 6(1)(e)); and
(c) take all reasonable steps to prevent and respond to the forms of violence by
AT and MC towards the Residents (particularly Ms
Leicester) as people with
disability on 5 occasions (s 6(1)(f)).
admitted breaches of the NDIS Code of Conduct give rise to 27 contraventions of
ss 73J and 73V(3) of the NDIS Act (54 contraventions
already referred to, Ms Edwards, during the Relevant Period was employed as
Coordinator (or House Manager) until about June 2020,
and Service Specialist
– Disability from 10 August 2020. As Coordinator, Ms Edwards was
responsible for managing Hakone House
and two other residential services,
including their staff, residents, resident budgets and clinical orders. As a
Service Specialist
– Disability, Ms Edwards was responsible at Hakone
House (and eight other houses) for, inter alia: incident support prevention
response (as part of a wider team); assurance of compliance with contractual,
regulatory and safeguarding standards and requirements;
and service-based
compliance and monitoring of quality of service.
Edwards admits that in breach of the NDIS Code of Conduct, she failed
(a) provide supports and services in a safe and competent manner, with care and
skill to the Residents on 5 occasions, knowing prior
to those incidents that AT
was prone to physical aggression towards the Residents which posed a risk of
injury to the Residents (particularly
Ms Leicester) and support workers (s
(b) take reasonable steps to eliminate or minimise the risks identified in (a)
above, and the steps taken being insufficient to address
those risks;
(c) promptly take steps to raise and act on concerns about matters relating to
AT’s physical aggression towards the Residents
and support workers in
earlier incidents that may impact the quality and safety of supports and
services provided to the Residents
at Hakone House on 5 occasions (s 6(1)(e));
(d) take all reasonable steps to prevent and respond to the forms of violence by
AT towards the Residents (particularly Ms Leicester)
as people with disability
on 3 occasions (s 6(1)(f)).
admitted breaches of the NDIS Code of Conduct give rise to contraventions of s
73V(3) of the NDIS Act.
Relief Sought
Pecuniary penalty
application is to be determined under the
Regulatory Powers (Standard
Provisions) Act 2014
(Cth) (RPA). Relevantly,
of the RPA are as
Civil penalty orders
Application for order
(1) An authorised applicant may apply to a relevant court for an order that a
person, who is alleged to have contravened a civil
penalty provision, pay the
Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty.
(2) The authorised applicant must make the application within 6 years of the
alleged contravention.
Court may order person to pay pecuniary penalty
(3) If the relevant court is satisfied that the person has contravened the civil
penalty provision, the court may order the person
to pay to the Commonwealth
such pecuniary penalty for the contravention as the court determines to be
appropriate.
Note: Subsection (5) sets out the maximum penalty that the court may order
the person to pay.
(4) An order under subsection (3) is a
civil penalty order
Determining pecuniary penalty
(5) The pecuniary penalty must not be more than:
(a) if the person is a body corporate—5 times the pecuniary penalty
specified for the civil penalty provision; and
(b) otherwise—the pecuniary penalty specified for the civil penalty
(6) In determining the pecuniary penalty, the court must take into account all
relevant matters, including:
(a) the nature and extent of the
contravention; and
(b) the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered because of the
contravention; and
(c) the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and
(d) whether the person has previously been found by
a court (including a court in a foreign country) to have engaged in any similar
Civil enforcement of penalty
(1) A pecuniary penalty is a debt payable to the Commonwealth.
(2) The Commonwealth may enforce a civil penalty order as if it were an order
made in civil proceedings against the person to recover
a debt due by the
person. The debt arising from the order is taken to be a judgement debt.
Conduct contravening more than one
civil penalty provision
(1) If conduct constitutes a contravention of 2 or more civil penalty
provisions, proceedings may be instituted under this Part against
a person in
relation to the contravention of any one or more of those provisions.
(2) However, the person is not liable to more than one pecuniary penalty under
this Part in relation to the same conduct.
Multiple contraventions
(1) A relevant court may make a single civil penalty order against a person for
multiple contraventions of a civil penalty provision
if proceedings for the
contraventions are founded on the same facts, or if the contraventions form, or
are part of, a series of contraventions
of the same or a similar character.
Note: For continuing
contraventions of civil penalty provisions, see
section 93.
(2) However, the penalty must not exceed the sum of the maximum penalties
that could be ordered if a separate penalty were ordered
for each of the
contraventions.

of the RPA, the maximum penalty for each
contravention is 1250 penalty units. At the time of the contraventions spanning
June 2019 to 25 October 2021, the individual penalty unit

submissions:
primary purpose of any civil penalty regime is to ensure compliance with the
statutory regime by deterring future contraventions:

Australia v Director, Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate
(2015) 258 CLR 482

pecuniary penalties are “primarily if not wholly protective in promoting
the public interest in compliance
[with the statute]”:
Agreed Penalties

Australian Building and
Construction Commissioner
v Pattinson

authorities reveal the principal object of a pecuniary penalty is deterrence.
is, specific deterrence of the contravener and, by that example, general
deterrence of other would-be contraveners:

nature of the Court’s task in imposing a civil penalty under
RPA, is to impose a pecuniary penalty that the Court determines to be
appropriate, having regard to all relevant matters,
including those set out in
of the RPA. That process involves an intuitive or instinctive synthesis of
all the relevant factors:
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v
Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Limited
[2015] FCA 330
(2015) 327 ALR 540
TPG Internet Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer
[2012] FCAFC 190
(2012) 210 FCR 277
. Instinctive
synthesis is the method by which the judge identifies all the factors that are
relevant to the penalty and, after weighing
all of those factors, reaches a
conclusion that a particular penalty is the one that should be imposed:
Markarian v The Queen
[2005] HCA 25
; (2005) 228 CLR 357
) at [37]; and see
viagogo AG v
Competition and Consumer Commission
[2022] FCAFC 87
[148]-[151].
Section 82(6)
sets out the factors required to be taken into
consideration. Those factors are not exhaustive of what may be relevant, and the
identified in other civil penalty contexts may also be relevant
(recognising presently that there is overlap with the
factors). The
factors identified additionally include matters such as: the seriousness of the
conduct; the size of the contravening
company; the deliberateness of the
contravention and the period over which it extended; whether further
contraventions are likely;
whether the contravention arose out of conduct of
senior management; whether the contravener has a corporate culture conducive to
compliance as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other
corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention;
and whether
there has been cooperation with the authorities, including in the context of the
proceedings.
list of factors is not exhaustive and ought not to be approached as a checklist.
Rather, the Court is to weigh all the relevant
circumstances. In this case, that
must be applied in the context of the statutory scheme under which the
contraventions occurred:

Commission v Australian Foundation for Disability
[2023] FCA 629

is also had to the maximum penalty. In this respect, in
majority observed at [31] that attention to maximum penalties will almost always
be required because: the legislature has legislated
for them; they invite
comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the
time; and because they do provide,
taken and balanced with all of the other
relevant factors, a yardstick: see
Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission v
Reckitt Benckiser
(Australia) Pty Ltd
; (2016) 340 ALR 25 at
Reckitt Benckiser
at [53]. That said, the applicant submitted that subject to the
issues of multiple contraventions, courses of conduct and double
punishment, the
maximum theoretical aggregate of penalties for all of the contraventions of ss
73J and 73V(3) of the NDIS Act, is
$18,992,500. This is a case involving a
sufficiently large number of contraventions, such that the maximum aggregate
penalty rises
to such a number that it is no longer meaningful:
at [157]. In that circumstance “the focus should be on the
conduct and on determining a penalty to match the conduct”:
Energy Regulator v Origin Energy Electricity Ltd
[2022] FCA 802
Australian Energy Regulator v Santos Direct Pty Ltd
[2024] FCA 579
principle of totality requires the Court to make a “final check” of
the penalties to be imposed on a wrongdoer, considered
as a whole, to ensure
that the total penalty does not exceed what is proper for the entire
contravening conduct:
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v
Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd

(1988) 166 CLR 59.
appropriate penalty is therefore one that is fashioned by reference to the facts
of the particular case before the Court, in order
to arrive at a penalty that is
sufficient to deter the conduct in question, without being overly oppressive:
principles to be applied in considering a jointly proposed penalty were
considered in the
Agreed Penalties Case
, where the majority observed at
[T]here is an important public policy involved in promoting predictability of
outcome in civil penalty proceedings and that the practice
of receiving and, if
appropriate, accepting agreed penalty submissions increases the predictability
of outcome for regulators and
wrongdoers. As was recognised in
and authoritatively determined
NW Frozen Foods
, such predictability
of outcome encourages corporations to acknowledge contraventions, which, in
turn, assists in avoiding lengthy
and complex litigation and thus tends to free
the courts to deal with other matters and to free investigating officers to turn
other areas of investigation that await their attention.
their Honours said at [58]:
... Subject to the court being sufficiently persuaded of the accuracy of the
parties’ agreement as to facts and consequences,
and that the penalty
which the parties propose is
appropriate remedy in the circumstances
thus revealed, it is consistent with principle and ... highly desirable in
practice for the
court to accept the parties’ proposal and therefore
impose the proposed penalty.
(emphasis added)
observations about the desirability of acting upon agreed penalty submissions
were made in the context of a broader recognition
that as a civil litigant in
civil proceedings, civil penalties are but one of numerous forms of relief which
regulators can pursue,
and it is entirely orthodox for regulators to make
submissions as to that relief: see
Agreed Penalties Case
[57]-[59], [63], [103] and [107]. Those principles to be applied in considering
a jointly proposed penalty were recently
considered in
Aktiengesellschaft v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
(2021) 284 FCR 24
) at [124]-[131], referring to
Agreed Penalties Case
NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian
Competition Commission
[1996] FCA 1134
(1996) 71 FCR 285
for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd
(2004) ATPR 41-993.
A number of points were highlighted.
the Court must be satisfied that the penalty proposed by the parties is
appropriate: at [125].
, if persuaded of the accuracy of the
parties’ agreement as to the facts and that the proposed penalty is an
appropriate remedy,
it is highly desirable for the Court to accept the proposal:
, in considering whether the proposed penalty is
appropriate, it is necessary to bear in mind that there is no single appropriate
penalty, but rather a permissible range. The proposed penalty may be
“an” appropriate penalty if it falls within that
range: at [127].
, the Court should generally recognise that the proposed penalty
was most likely a result of compromise and pragmatism on the part
regulator, and while the regulator must estimate the penalty necessary to
achieve deterrence, the Court must assess the proposed
penalty on its merits,
being wary of the possibility that the regulator may have been too pragmatic: at
, the Court’s task is not limited to simply determining
whether the jointly proposed penalty is within the permissible range,
that might be expected to be a highly relevant and perhaps a determinative
consideration.
The overriding statutory directive is
for the Court to impose a penalty that is determined to be appropriate having
regard to all
relevant matters: at [131].
Declaratory relief
Commissioner also seeks declaratory relief in terms that she identified.
power to grant declaratory relief pursuant to s 21 of
Federal Court of
Australia Act 1976
(Cth) “is a very wide one” and the Court is
“limited only by its discretion”:

Jododex Australia Pty Ltd
[1972] HCA 61
(1972) 127 CLR 421
at 435. Three requirements need to be satisfied before making declarations: (1)
the question must be a real and not a hypothetical
or theoretical one; (2) the
applicant must have a real interest in raising it; and (3) there must be a
proper contradictor:
at 437-438. That a party has chosen not to
oppose a particular grant of declaratory relief is not an impediment to such
relief being
granted by the Court:
Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission v MSY Technology Pty Ltd
[2012] FCAFC 56
(2012) 201 FCR 378
and [30]-[33]. Other factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion
include: (a) whether the declaration will have any utility;
(b) whether the
proceeding involves a matter of public interest; and (c) whether the
circumstances call for the Court expressing
its disapproval of the contravening

Consideration
Commissioner addressed what she submitted were the relevant factors to consider
in assessing the penalty in this proceeding. Lifestyle
Solutions and Ms Edwards
endorse the Commissioner’s submission with some additional observations by
Lifestyle Solutions. Given
that, it is unnecessary to recite the submissions in
detail. In addition to the agreed facts, the Commissioner and the Lifestyle
Solutions tendered some additional material, which I have taken into account in
assessing the appropriateness of the agreed penalty.
note at the outset that the Commissioner does not apply for any penalty against
Ms Edwards in circumstances where a substantial
penalty is being imposed on
Lifestyle Solutions. It is also submitted the declarations recording her
contraventions are sufficient
deterrence in the circumstances of this
proceeding.
accept the Commissioner’s submission as to the nature and characterisation
of the contraventions, and the matters relating
to the considerations for the
penalty sought for the reasons given.
number of observations can be made about the relevant considerations.
the seriousness of the contraventions cannot be disputed in light of the nature,
number and period of time over which they were
committed. There are 96
contraventions by Lifestyle Solutions, relating to 69 breaches of the NDIS
Practice Standards and NDIS Code
of Conduct, and its statutory conditions of
registration. These contraventions arise in relation to 18 incidents of physical
by AT or MC, taking place over a two-year period from 24 October 2019
to 25 October 2021. The incidents occurred in Hakone House,
an environment
created and controlled by Lifestyle Solutions. Those 18 incidents took place
within the broader context of physical
aggression during the Relevant Period by
AT and MC. The agreed facts contain evidence of 36 incidents of physical
aggression by AT
(15 incidents giving rise to contraventions), 11 incidents of
physical aggression by MC (3 of those incidents giving rise to contraventions).
They included instances of wounding, biting, head locks, knocking to the ground,
pulling out hair, physical grabbing and property
damage. As noted by the
Commissioner, some incidents required the Residents or support workers to be
protected for their safety and
numerous incidents involved injuries to support
workers, or attacks on support workers.
said, the Commissioner identified (and the penalty sought reflected) that some
contraventions relating to certain incidents were
more serious than others. Not
to be taken as minimising the seriousness of any of the incidents, the
Commissioner highlighted certain
incidents as examples of the serious nature of
the behaviour and its consequences, being AT Incident 6: AF [47]; AT Incident
AF [57]-[60]; AT Incident 14: AF [61]-[68]; AT Incident 24: AF
[90]-[92]; AT Incident 25: AF [94]-[95]; AT Incident 31: AF [107]-[109];
Incident 11: AF [116]-[117]; AT Incident 35: AF [118]-[121]; and AT
Incident 36: AF [122]-[123]. Those examples do illustrate
the nature of the
contraventions and the frequency or regularity with which they occurred, which
can only be appreciated by considering
the agreed facts. They are also the
incidents identified by the Commissioner as the most serious for which the
highest penalties
are sought. Suffice for present purposes to refer to one
example. That is AT Incident 24, where AT entered Ms Leicester’s room
where she was sleeping, and bit her on her face. When a support worker came to
intervene, AT grabbed the support worker’s breast
and bit her through her
jumper, causing bruising and bite marks. Another support worker moved the other
residents of Hakone House
outside for their safety, until AT calmed down. The
bite left a skin wound on Ms Leicester’s cheek and bruising on her cheek,
chin and neck (which was depicted in photographs annexed to the agreed facts).
is to be recalled that the contraventions occurred in the broader context of
other incidents of physical aggression. The broader
context is, inter alia,
evidence of the knowledge Lifestyle Solutions had in relation to the propensity
of AT and MC to act in particular
ways: see also [
] above. The risks to others were
known risks.
the Residents (as NDIS participants) were subjected to violence by one of the
other Residents while residing in Hakone House, a
shared supported living
environment. That shared environment was unsafe, and not appropriate for the
Residents’ needs. The
risks to participants and workers were not properly
identified and managed. The contraventions arose from a pattern of aggressive
behaviour by AT and MC towards Ms Leicester in particular, the other Residents
and the support workers, in the participants’
presented known risks, that resulted in repeated instances of aggression and
injury over a period of more
than two years, within the close confines of Hakone
House. As a result, the Residents and support workers suffered actual injuries,
the risk of further or more serious injuries, and significant distress.
Lifestyle Solutions is a very substantial provider of disability support
services. It currently has approximately 2,010 employees
and provides services
to over 897 people across Australia including over 353 people with disability.
In 2023, Lifestyle Solutions
provided services to over 2,005 people across
Australia including over 1,705 people with disability. During at least the
Period, Lifestyle Solutions provided NDIS services to persons with
disability in all States and Territories except South Australia.
It currently
provides NDIS services to persons with disability in Queensland, New South
Wales, Western Australia, the Australian
Capital Territory and the Northern
Territory. Lifestyle Solutions operates 73 Supported Independent Living Sites
and has 23 properties
registered as Specialist Disability Accommodation.
Evidence was provided of the financial position of Lifestyle Solutions and its
parent companies. In the context of Lifestyle Solutions’ very substantial
revenue and broad scope of operations, and the resources
of its parent
companies, a substantial penalty is needed to serve the purpose of deterrence.
the fact that a respondent is a not-for-profit entity “does not obviate
the significance of specific deterrence, or
of the very serious nature of the
contraventions”:
the reporting to senior management was inadequate and omitted key details that
were needed for a proper risk assessment. For example,
Lifestyle Solutions then
CEO signed a confidential report on 11 September 2020, which was prepared
following AT Incident 17. It can
readily be accepted the report was, as
described by the Commissioner, “deeply inadequate”. It reported
inter alia,
A review of incident reports in respect of ... AT identified only
other reported incident involving physical aggression towards [Ms Leicester]
resulting in minor injury
. Incident Report Ref. 19305 [AT Incident 14]
relates ...
(emphasis added)
14 refers to an occasion when AT was left unattended and bit Ms Leicester on the
right-hand side of her face, on her cheek
close to the eye, following which Ms
Leicester was prescribed antibiotics for 5 days, and recommended to follow up
with a tetanus
vaccination. The confidential report did not include reference to
several key issues and incidents, to which Lifestyle Solutions
has now admitted
contraventions. When Ms Leicester’s family subsequently raised concerns
directly with senior management, Lifestyle
Solutions failed to prevent further
and aligned with the above observation, the number and extent of
contraventions at Hakone House, over a period of two years, suggests
culture of compliance even though each of the incidents was recorded in
Lifestyle Solutions’ “Riskman” database.
As reflected above,
the incidents were not treated sufficiently seriously, and the risks posed by AT
and MC were not sufficiently
managed or acted upon. It was only after two years
of consistent abuse and injury to Ms Leicester, did the CEO of Lifestyle
come to the realisation that the Hakone House residence was “not
the right solution for this cohort”. I accept the Commissioner’s
submission that the conclusion was obvious well before then.
Lifestyle Solutions acknowledged liability at the earliest possible stage in
these proceedings, cooperated in participating in mediation,
preparing the
agreed facts and agreeing on the proposed aggregate penalty of $2,000,000,
broken down by specific incidents. This
conduct provides a real utilitarian
benefit by freeing up regulator and court resources, as well as encouraging
other contraveners
to cooperate: see e.g.
Construction, Forestry, Maritime,
Mining and Energy Union v Fair Work Ombudsman (The Botany Cranes Case)
[2023] FCAFC 40
(2023) 297 FCR 438
. That cooperation has been
factored into the agreed penalty.
this context, the Commissioner submitted that despite their co-operation there
has been no apology by Lifestyle Solutions for its
conduct in this proceeding
and therefore there is no evidence of remorse or contrition. That may be
accepted. However, as Lifestyle
Solutions submitted that is not an aggravating
factor. There is the absence of a mitigating factor, and it is a factor not
on. Lifestyle Solutions also submitted that given the change in personnel
(as described below) an apology in any event would be less
meaningful.
Lifestyle Solutions has no prior record of contraventions, although as noted
above, another proceeding involving Lifestyle Solutions
was heard concurrently
with this proceeding relating to Lifestyle Solutions’ failure to notify
the Commissioner of reportable
incidents. There was some degree of overlap,
including one incident which forms a contravention in both proceedings. That is
AT Incident
29, in which AT grabbed Ms Leicester by the arms and attempted to
bite her, before a support worker intervened which was required
to be reported
within 24 hours of the incident but was reported 187 days late.
Lifestyle Solutions provided evidence that they now have in place a suite of
policies and procedures which are relevant to the issues
that arose in this
proceeding, observance of which will facilitate timely identification and
management of risks by Lifestyle Solutions
and guard against repeat
contraventions of the kind that are the subject of this proceeding. These
policies were implemented post
these incidents. These proceedings made clear
Lifestyle Solutions needed to improve the policies and procedures it had in
as to prevent repeated occurrences of the conduct the subject of the
contraventions. However, as the Commissioner observed, no matter
prepared and well written a policy is, the ultimate measure and efficacy of any
such policy relies heavily upon its implementation
and adherence. So much can be
evidence relied on by Lifestyle Solutions establishes that on 1 September 2025,
Possability Group Ltd (ACN 638 044 327) (PGL)
(including Lifestyle Solutions)
was acquired by Independence Australia Group Limited (ACN 004 979 837) (IAG).
IAG became the sole
member of PGL and the ultimate parent company of Lifestyle
Solutions. All existing directors of Lifestyle Solutions and PGL resigned
were replaced by IAG nominee directors. Lifestyle Solutions submitted:
The merger of IAG and PGL, as well as the complete turnover of Lifestyle
Solutions’ senior leadership, indicate a reduced need
for specific
deterrence than would be the case had Lifestyle Solutions continued to have the
same separate existence and senior management
as it did throughout the Relevant
Solutions submitted that the agreed penalty appropriately reflects this
consideration. It is recognised that this change
in the entity and its senior
management may moderate the need for specific deterrence by comparison to other
cases: see e.g.
Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Statewide
Superannuation Pty Ltd
[2021] FCA 1650
Securities and Investments Commission v LGSS Pty Ltd (No 3)
[2025] FCA 205
. That said, although this tempers the need for specific deterrence, as
Lifestyle Solutions properly recognised, it does not eliminate
the need for it.
in respect to the fact there are multiple contraventions, and with regard to the
principles relevant to double punishment and courses
of conduct, the
Commissioner has approached the fixing of the total sum of the penalty by
considering 18 separate penalties, one
for each of the incidents giving rise to
contraventions. Each incident reflects contraventions of either s 73J (where the
involves breaches of the NDIS Practice Standards alone), or both ss 73J
and 73V(3) (where the conduct involves breaches of both the
NDIS Practice
Standards and the NDIS Code of Conduct).
each of the 18 incidents, the contraventions arising from multiple breaches of
the NDIS Practice Standards and NDIS Code of Conduct
can appropriately be
treated as a single course of conduct for each incident. Where there are
multiple separate breaches of the NDIS
Practice Standards or the NDIS Code of
Conduct in relation to a particular incident, they are not “in relation to
conduct” for the purpose of s 84(2) of the RPA. Each of those
provisions is a different and separate obligation, applying to
each incident
from a different perspective, and imposed for a different purpose:
at [55]. The Commissioner accepted that where the same conduct contravenes both
ss 73J and 73V(3) they are “in relation to
the same conduct” for the
purpose of s 84(2), and only a single penalty is available.
accept in the circumstances of this case, that approach is appropriate.
I return to the facts underpinning the contraventions.
a registered NDIS provider, Lifestyle Solutions was obliged to comply with its
statutory conditions of registration, including
to comply with the NDIS Practice
Standards and NDIS Code of Conduct. It was responsible for the care and support
of five highly vulnerable
members of the community, living at Hakone House, a
facility which Lifestyle Solutions both created and administered. Each of the
Residents was unable to care for themselves and required a high degree of care.
They and their families depended on Lifestyle Solutions
to care for and protect
them. Their families placed their trust in Lifestyle Solutions that it would
provide supervision, support
and a safe environment, as they were entitled to
do. The Residents were entitled to live free from abuse and neglect, and to have
their worth and dignity respected. That did not occur.
agreed facts reflect a pattern of aggressive behaviour by AT and MC towards
Ms Leicester, the other Residents in Hakone House,
and the support workers.
The contraventions reflect that for over two years, Hakone House was not a safe
environment for the Residents
or support workers. Ms Leicester was the primary
victim of repeated physical aggression from AT or MC, was consequently injured
suffered bite injuries to her face and arms resulting in broken skin and
bruising, requiring medical attention on two occasions)
and on occasions,
support workers had to take steps to protect Ms Leicester and the other
Residents from AT. In one incident, Ms
Leicester was shut inside a bathroom to
keep her safe, while AT banged on the door. It can be inferred Ms Leicester
feared for her
safety in her own home and what should have been a protected and
supportive environment. The distressing nature of the incidents
is obvious. The
other Residents and support workers were also the victim of incidents and
suffered injuries. The abuse was not managed,
assessed or responded to
adequately or appropriately.
date, there have been few cases considered by the Court brought by the
Commissioner against NDIS providers for contraventions of
the NDIS scheme. This
is the first case which is directed towards contraventions that have arisen from
abuse of this nature in a
supported accommodation facility.
Commissioner referred to findings made by the Royal Commission into Violence,
Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability
with respect to a
supported living accommodation provider, which found in respect of a case study
that “interpersonal violence
between residents [had become]
normalised”:
Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and
Exploitation of People with Disability
(Public Hearing Report, 20 February
2023) Finding 17. The Royal Commission further observed in relation to
another NDIS provider:
It is true that the judgments required of service providers and regulators are
not always straightforward or easy to determine. But
disability support
providers, especially those providing SIL [Supported Independent Living]
services and SDA [Specialist Disability
Accommodation] ..., must always strive
to eliminate all forms of violence against and abuse, neglect and exploitation
of those they
(citation omitted)
highlights the importance of deterrence in the penalty to be imposed in this
case. As the Commissioner submitted, violence and
abuse in supported living
accommodation settings is never acceptable and should not be allowed to become
normalised. It is important
that the penalty imposed on Lifestyle Solutions is
of a size that marks the seriousness of the contraventions.
already explained, the total penalty proposed by the parties to be imposed on
Lifestyle Solutions for its contraventions of ss
73J and 73V(3) of the NDIS Act
is $2,000,000. That comprises a penalty imposed in respect to each incident
giving rise to a contravention.
The table below details for each incident: the
date; the incident reference (as referred to in the agreed facts); the relevant
from the NDIS Practice Standards and the NDIS Code of Conduct that
are said to have been breached; the maximum penalty for a single
contravention,
as applied at the time; and the proposed penalty in respect of that incident.
considered the facts agreed between the parties, their respective submissions,
the evidence relied on, the contraventions and
relevant principles, I am
satisfied that it is appropriate to order a pecuniary penalty against Lifestyle
Solutions in the amount
of $2,000,000 and to make the declarations sought.
reaching that conclusion, I am conscious of the approach outlined in
described above, including that the Court must assess
the proposed penalty on its merits, being wary of the possibility that the
may have been too pragmatic:
at [129]. That said, as
explained above, where the Court is persuaded that the agreed penalty proposed
is an appropriate remedy in
all the circumstances, it is highly desirable in
practice for the Court to accept the parties’ proposal and therefore
the proposed penalty:
is readily apparent from the submissions that the parties have given close and
careful consideration to the relevant issues, the
appropriate declarations,
orders and pecuniary penalties. That is so with one of the parties being the
Commissioner, a specialist
regulator. In that context, in the
Penalties Case
, the High Court at [60]-[61], noted the relevance of the fact
that submissions were being advanced by a specialist regulator able
“informed submissions as to the effects of contravention on the industry
and the level of penalty necessary to achieve
compliance”, albeit that
such submissions will be considered on the merits in the ordinary way.
Court must impose a penalty that is appropriate in all the circumstances. The
principal object of deterrence is achieved if the
pecuniary penalty has the
necessary “sting or burden” to secure “the specific and
general deterrent effects that
are the raison d’être of its
imposition”:
Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy
I observed in
The consequences that may ensue from breaches of the NDIS Code of Conduct and
NDIS Practice Standards are potentially grave given
the vulnerability of NDIS
participants. The present case is a stark example of this. The objects of the
NDIS scheme include “protecting
and preventing people with disability from
experiencing harm arising from poor quality or unsafe supports or services
provided under
the NDIS”, and “promoting the provision of high
quality and innovative supports that enable people with disability to
independent lifestyles and full inclusion in the community”. The
importance of NDIS providers (and persons employed
or engaged by them) complying
with the obligations imposed by the NDIS Act, cannot be overstated. The
protective nature of ss 73V
and 73J, their role in promoting high quality
supports for people with disability, and the vulnerability of people with
to harm when that support is not provided, emphasise the seriousness
of breaching each of those provisions.
the factual basis of the contraventions is different, the observations are
nonetheless apt in these circumstances.
a period of two years, primarily Ms Leicester but also other Residents and
support workers, were subjected to repeated incidents
of physical aggression and
attacks, as described in the agreed facts. The Residents were entitled to be
safe and protected, but they
were not. These issues were not managed or reported
on adequately. Lifestyle Solutions did not take all reasonable steps to respond
to and prevent further violence. The seriousness of the contraventions and the
impact that conduct has had on those affected is self-evident.
accept the submission that a penalty of $2,000,000 on Lifestyle Solutions will
meet the primary objectives of specific and general
deterrence, informed by the
relevant factors, and is within the appropriate range for the admitted
contraventions.
the circumstances of this case, I am also satisfied that the declaratory relief
in relation to Lifestyle Solutions and Ms Edwards
in the terms sought is
appropriate. The matter is of public interest by reason of, inter alia, its
subject matter, the vulnerable
position of the NDIS participants, and the nature
and consequences of the failures. These circumstances call for the marking of
Court’s disapproval of the conduct. Consequently, the declarations
sought have significant utility. I accept the terms of the
declarations that
detail what has occurred and contain appropriate and adequate particulars of why
the conduct is a contravention.
I am satisfied that it is in the interests of
justice to make the declarations sought.

applicant’s costs for the proceedings. The costs
