Applicants responded to the Form 7 with a Form 8 dated 24 January 2025 (
), wherein they stated that they disagreed with the proposed protection
work and also requested further information.
Applicants gave the following reasons for their response in the Form
B. Disagree with
the proposed protection work for the following reasons:
Neither the
protection work proposed nor the decision made by Shane Merrick (RBS) is for the
protection of my property.
The decision
dated 18 December 2024 will have a significant and detrimental impact on my
property, which include quality of life,
mental health, for the lengthy duration of the work and beyond.
Therefore, I
must formally, and in the strongest possible terms, object to this decision made
by Shane Merrick (RBS) dated 18 December
Shane Merrick
(RBS) failed to correctly comply with VBA protocol.
Therefore the
protection work notice issued by Shane Merrick (RBS) on 18 December 2024 could
be construed to be made in bad faith.
C. Request the following
further information:
Please provide
all documents you have relied upon to arrive at the Protection Work Decision
dated 18 December 2024.
Including but
not limited to file notes, working documents, methodology and professional
advice that you relied upon from properly
qualified experts.
Provide the flow
chart that you established for 549 Royal Parade Parkville to impose your
Protection Work Decision and the method
to be used for the protection work.
Provide your
delegated obligations in issuing the decision for protection work whilst
complying with your mandatory Surveyor’s
Code of Conduct obligation.
Without all of
the requested documentation I will be further disadvantaged if any consultation
should be requested by any party.
a result of the response provided by the Applicant in the Form 8, the RBS
requested further information from the Interested Parties.
That further
information was provided in the form of:

Method Statement
summary, the Method Statement required the protection of the roof of the lean-to
at the rear part of the Adjoining Property to
be achieved by the installation of
a protective sheet ‘to catch the droppings of mortar or small chips from
the brick work’
during construction of the New
The remaining statements
contained in the Method Statement concern the new Wall to be constructed, which
concerns building work
rather than protection work.

Act, that the proposed protection work was adequate in a determination dated 7
March 2025 recorded in a Form 9 (

access would be required to the Adjoining Property in order to lay the

of the Act, the Applicant, as the owner of the Adjoining Property,
may appeal to the BAB against the determination made by the RBS
pursuant to
of the Act as to the appropriateness of protection work.
of the Act, the hearing before the BAB is in the nature of a
re-hearing, and we can take account of material that was not before
the RBS when
he made the Form 9.
Applicant submits that the proposed protection work, consisting of the ply wood
sheeting to be placed on the roof of the lean-to
at the rear of the Adjoining
Property is inadequate because,
a) It fails to protect people from any falling debris during the construction of
the New Wall;
b) The proposed protection work does not address any dust
c) No physical barrier along the boundary is
Applicant submits that the protection work should consist of a vertical barrier
along the boundary to prevent debris during the
carrying out of the Building
Work from falling into the Adjoining
Applicant also makes a number of allegations to submit that the RBS has breached
Code of Conduct for Building Surveyors.
We note that the BAB is not a
disciplinary tribunal and does not have the jurisdiction to consider these
allegations made by the
Applicant. Therefore, we will make no findings in
respect of them.
Respondent submits that the proposed protection work is sufficient to protect
the Adjoining Property from falling debris during
the carrying out of the
Building Work, and that the Method Statement sets out the manner in which the
Building Work will be carried
out without the need to access the Adjoining
Property. The Respondent also refers to the required insurance being in place,
the fact that the Building Work is to be carried out by an experienced
, the Applicant reiterates her concerns and also refers to the
need to account for the flue in the lean-to roof when the ply sheeting
Further, she expressed concerns about the security of the ply sheeting in high
winds and the lack of specification of that
note that the principal construction activity giving rise to the need for
protection work appears to be the construction of the
New Wall. We also note
that the Method Statement sets out a method of constructing the New Wall without
the need to access the Adjoining
find that the proposed protection work involving the placement of ply sheeting
on the roof of the lean-to is an appropriate solution
to the risk of debris
falling onto that roof during the carrying out of the Building Work. However,
we also find that an assessment
should be carried out to determine whether any
measures are required to protect the flue from the hot water system on the
Property from damage. Further, consideration should be given as to
whether the ply sheeting needs to be secured in any way to prevent
it becoming
dislodged in high winds.
we understand the concerns of the Applicant about debris falling into the
Adjoining Property and potentially harming people
or causing damage to areas
adjacent to the lean-to. In this regard we note that the definition of
‘protection work’
of the Act includes:
permanent or temporary work of—
(iii) overhead protection for adjoining property; ...
also note that the SDA Letter refers to discussions between the Applicant and
the Interested Parties concerning the installation
of a vertical barrier on or
adjacent to the boundary between the properties to address the concern of
overhead protection to the
Adjoining Property in an area wider than the roof of
the lean-to.
our view the protection work should address the overhead protection of the
Adjoining Property more broadly, rather than just in
the area of the roof to the
lean-to. In particular, it should address the Applicant’s concerns about
the protection of people
using the open space at the rear of the Adjoining
Property. It appears that such protection can be achieved by the installation of
a vertical or near-vertical barrier on or adjacent to the boundary. For this
reason, pursuant to
s 149(1)(d)(ii)
we will set aside the Form 9 and remit the
decision to the RBS for reconsideration taking account of our recommendation as
in this paragraph.
the Applicant submitted that the facts of this matter are similar to those in
Janney & Anor v Steller Works Pty Ltd
do not consider that Janney is relevant to the fact in this matter. Janney was
concerned with the trespass of an overhead crane
which was being used to carry
out building work. It was not concerned with protection work under
the Act. The definition of ‘protection work’ in
concludes with the statement that the protection work means the work set
whether or not the work or equipment is carried out or used on,
over, under or in the air space above the land on which the building
is to be carried out or the adjoining property;
of the Act provides:
(1) An owner or the agent of an owner may enter between the hours of 8 a.m. and
6 p.m. on, over, under or into the air space above
any adjoining property—
(a) to carry out any survey under
(b) to carry out the protection work required by the building regulations and
agreed or taken to be agreed to or determined under
of the Act provides:
If notice of entry has been given in
accordance with
section 95(2)
, the adjoining owner or the adjoining occupier
(a) refuse to admit the owner or the owner's agents to the adjoining property in
accordance with the notice for the purpose of carrying
out the survey or
protection work; or
(b) obstruct or hinder the owner or the owner's agents in carrying out the
survey or protection work on, over, under or in the air
space above the
adjoining property.
provisions indicate that protection work under
of the Act may be carried
out ‘on, over, under or in the air space above the adjoining
property’. As such, the common
law principles set out in
respect of the carrying out of building work must be understood in relation to
the statutory regime under
of the Act in respect of protection
DATE OF DETERMINATION: 27 June 2025
Clause 17 of Schedule 3 to the
Building Act 1993
provides: ‘Unless the Building Appeals Board
otherwise determines, a party to a proceeding before the Board must bear his,
or its own costs’.
