COMMISSIONER RYAN
MELBOURNE, 24 DECEMBER 2012
Proposed protected action ballot by employees of UGL Kaefer.
This is an application for a protected action ballot of members of The Australian Workers’ Union (AWU) employed by UGL Kaefer.
Mr Terry Elliott, National IR Manager, Operations & Maintenance, advised my chambers by email on 24 December 2012 that the company
does not oppose the application.
In the circumstances I have decided to determine the matter on the papers without a hearing.
I am satisfied that the requirements of the Act have been met and that accordingly an order must be made. An order based on the draft
provided by the AWU has been issued in conjunction with this decision.
