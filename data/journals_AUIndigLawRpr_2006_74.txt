Kemp v Native Title Registrar
Held, setting aside the Registrar’s decision:
Kemp v Native Title Registrar
Federal Court of Australia (Branson J)
25 July 2006
[2006] FCA 939
Native Title — competing land claims — judicial review —
Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977
Native Title Act 1993
(Cth), ss 24,
In 1998, one Dr Davis-Hurst applied for judicial determination that she and
the people she represented, the Kattang people of the
Manning Valley, held
native title rights over lands known as Saltwater.
In 2003, Mr Kemp, a descendent of the Pirripaayi people, was joined as a
party to that litigation (
Davis-Hurst v Minister for Land and Water
Conservation (NSW)
[2003] FCA 541
(2003) 198 ALR 315)
as he expressed a concern that the
Kattang people were not the proper holders of native title rights over the
Saltwater, and he expressed
concerns over the identity of the ‘traditional
law and customs under which that native title is held’.
In August 2005 the Minister for Lands applied to the Native Title Tribunal
Native Title Act 1993
(Cth) (‘NTA’) for
the registration of an indigenous land use agreement in respect of the
Saltwater. Mr Kemp was not a
party to that agreement. Registration of the
agreement was to ‘[give] substance to’ a decision by the state of
the people represented by Dr Davis-Hurst, and not the Pirripaayi
people, should be recognised as holders of native title interests
In December 2005, a delegate of the Native Title Registrar registered the
agreement under
of the NTA, notwithstanding the recognition that prima
facie Mr Kemp may be a person that held rights and interests pursuant to native
title. Mr Kemp applied to the Federal Court for judicial review of that decision
under the ‘error of law’ provision of
Administrative
Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977
(s 5(1)(f)).
He asserted, first, that the Registrar misconstrued s 251A of the NTA, and,
second, that the Registrar should not have found the requirement
of s 24CG(3)(b)
of the NTA had been met as she had recognised Mr Kemp as a person who may hold
native title interests in relation
to land or waters, and he had not authorised
the agreement.
Held, setting aside the Registrar’s
1. The authorisation process set out in s 251A of the
understood as a process by which a
community or group may obtain a
decision. It will not obtain a decision ‘which is binding on two or more
groups where their
respective claims to hold native title in an area are in
conflict’: [41].
2. That being the case, the Registrar was incorrect in proceeding on the
basis that Mr Kemp was bound by the s 251A process undertaken
by the native
title group, and the requirements of s 24CG(3)(b) of the NTA were therefore not
met: [42], [43].
3. The phrase that that the agreement must be authorised by ‘all
persons who hold or may hold native title in relation to land
or water in the
area covered by the agreement’ in s 24CG(3)(b)(i) of the NTA does not
admit any of the ambiguities contemplated
in the majority judgement in
Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority
[1998] HCA 28
(1998) 194 CLR
at 384, and so is to be given its literal meaning: [48], [55], [57], [58],
[61]; cf [56]. The words chosen by the legislature do
not ‘readily admit
of limitation’: [55].
4. However, because it was open for Mr Kemp to make a separate native claim
over Saltwater, it was unnecessary for him to authorise
the making of the
agreement in issue: [62].
