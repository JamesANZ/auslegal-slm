Response received by State Growth on 30 October 2024.
The department has completed a corridor study for the East Tamar Highway, which has identified and prioritised improvement opportunities
along the highway. The corridor study is due for publication later this year.
Upgrading and improving the safety of the East Tamar Highway/University Way intersection has been identified as a high priority in
the corridor study.
The department has identified possible improvement options for this intersection in the planning work, including a roundabout or signalising
the intersection. The options will further be assessed as part of the design process, which is planned to start later this year.
The design process will include traffic modelling of the different options, public consultation, and selection of the preferred option.
In terms of timeframes, a typical design period for this type of project is about two years. Based on this, construction of safety
improvement could likely occur in the 2026-27 financial year.
While noting they were not related to the subject crash, previous road safety interventions implemented at this intersection include:
Extending the right turn deceleration lane on the East Tamar Highway in 2013-14 to reduce the likelihood of rear-end type crashes.
Banning the right turn movement from University Way to the East Tamar Highway in 2016, which was the highest safety risk involving
right turn movements at this location and had resulted in a disproportionate number of serious injury crashes for the very low number
of drivers making the right turn to the north.
The speed limit being lowered to 80km/h from the original 100km/h just north of the intersection. It is also noted that drivers turning
right into University Way from East Tamar Highway have an unobstructed forward view to this slower approaching southbound vehicles
and only need to select a gap in this one lane of oncoming traffic.
The department has been monitoring the safety performance of the intersection and there have been no other reported crashes involving
the right turn movement from East Tamar Highway and University Way since the subject crash.
