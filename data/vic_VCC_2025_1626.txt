HIS HONOUR:
a contract of sale dated 16 September 2009, CPT Custodian Pty Ltd as vendor
agreed to sell retail properties constituting the Meadow
Heights Shopping Centre
at 55 Paringa Boulevard, Meadow Heights, to Mirage Co Pty Ltd “and/or
nominee”. (Court Book (“CB”)
791) The price was $12,000,000,
payable by a 5 per cent deposit of $600,000 with the residue payable 90 days
after the day of sale.
A special condition (No 41) stated,
(Clause 41.1):
“Settlement of this Contract may not
occur before 21 December 2009 unless the Vendor obtains the Mortgagee
Approvals.”
“If the Vendor does not give notice to the
Purchaser that it has obtained the Mortgagee Approvals, then the Settlement Date
will be 21 December 2009 in accordance with special condition 25.” (CB
phrase “Mortgagee Approvals” was defined to
“the approval of the Mortgagee in accordance with the
provisions of the Loan Note Sale Agreement dated 21 December 2006 to which
Mortgagee and the Vendor are parties (among others) to the sale of the Property
by the Vendor before 21 December 2009.”
mortgagee was Sandhurst Trustees Limited. (CB 803)
Muhsin Tercan (who was the third defendant in this proceeding) and Mr Gazi Sener
(referred to as Mr Gazi, the second defendant
in this proceeding) guaranteed the
obligations of Mirage Co Pty Ltd, which, as Trustee of the Mirage Co Unit Trust,
is the fourth
defendant in this proceeding.
Deha Senbay said he has known Mr Gazi for 25 years as a fellow member of
Melbourne’s Turkish community. He said Mr Gazi
has “got a shop in
the Dallas Shopping Centre”, and that he had been “family
friends” with Mr Gazi, and “was
even invited to his son’s
wedding”. (Transcript (“T”) 64, Lines (“L”) 11-16)
He said that Mr
Gazi had spoken to his (Mr Senbay’s) brother Umit
“back in 2009 or 2010” (
, L18-19) about an investment
opportunity. He said that his brother had told him “there was an
opportunity about buying a shopping
centre” (T65, L24-25), and as a
consequence he (Mr Deha Senbay) spoke to Mr Gazi “briefly”.
, L24-27) According to Mr Senbay, he was told “they were
going to issue units and each unit was around $250,000”. (
L29-31) Mr Senbay said he was told by Mr Gazi:
“there was an
opportunity ... $250,000 per unit ... positive gearing, and then he never
mentioned anything about who other buyer
is or who the other unit shareholders
are.” (T68, L6-10)
to Mr Senbay, there was no mention of the loan being used to purchase the
shopping centre. (
, L20-21) He said:
thing that was discussed was the rent, the rent income we would receive, nothing
Senbay said that the return offered was 6 to 7 per cent, in contrast to the 4
per cent return which he was receiving from certain
residential properties which
he owned. (T69, L1-4) He said that the return being offered was not a net
return, “because there
were always expenses coming out”.
, L5-7) This was a gross return. (
, L13) The return
might be reduced by issues such as repair costs or vacancies of some of the
, L19-26) The subscription sought, according to Mr Senbay,
was “$250,000 plus whatever the stamp duty was.” This additional
charge was approximately $20,000. (T70, L6-12) He said he and his brother
contributed a half each of the required $250,000.
Mustafa Okur – a real estate agent, a member of the Turkish community, and
a friend of Mr Gazi – gave a similar account
of how he became involved in
an investment in the Meadow Heights Shopping Centre via Mr Gazi. He said
Mr Gazi “had a ... gift
shop in Dallas shopping centre” and
that he and Mr Gazi were from the same town in Turkey, namely Corum. (T99,
Okur said Mr Gazi told him that he was “going to buy the
[Meadow Heights] shopping centre and he asked me to buy a share”.
L1-2) This share was to be by way of units in a unit trust. Mr Okur said he
subscribed for two, making a total investment
of $500,000. (
According to Mr Okur, Mr Gazi told him that investment in the unit trust
“open for community. [
, the Turkish community]
He didn’t tell me his main director or anything.” (
to Mr Okur, Mr Gazi predicted “a good return ... 6 to 9 per cent return
for rental.” (
Abdurrahman Kuzucu describes himself as “a business manager at a
college” with a background in electronic engineering
and education. (T113,
L6-9) Like Mr Senbay and Mr Okur, Mr Kuzucu had known Mr Gazi as a member
of the Melbourne Turkish community
for many years. (
, L18-19) Mr
Kuzucu said that Mr Gazi approached him offering an opportunity to invest in the
Meadow Heights Shopping Centre. (
, L26-28) The discussion might have
taken place in Mr Gazi’s shop in Dallas. (
, L29-30) Mr
Kuzucu said Mr Gazi told him that “We’re buying a shopping centre
and we’re looking for shareholders
... we’d like you to invest, and
if you want to be an investor it will be good returns, et cetera.” (T114,
Kuzucu could not remember what returns were projected or promised. He
remarked “in any investment you’d expect there
to be capital gains
and obviously we were expecting rental from the property.” (
L10-12) Mr Kuzucu agreed that Mr Gazi did not mention capital gains,
“but that’s just obviously something you’d
, L13-15) Mr Kuzucu said that as to rental, he was given to
understand a return of “roughly about 10 per cent or something
, L23) He said Mr Gazi did not mention who the other
investors/unit holders would be. (
Aysegul Sertel described how she and her husband, Mr Ilker Abak, came to invest
in the shopping centre unit trust in 2009. She
is a psychologist by profession.
(T124, L28) She and her husband, she said, invested $250,000, together with a
further $38,000 for
stamp duty. (T125, L3-7) Once again, this subscription
seems to have derived from a meeting with Mr Gazi in his shop at Dallas.
said Mr Gazi told her “that it would be a proper business with structure
and that gave me confidence.” (
, L16-17) She said he told her
that the other unit holders would be “a combination of community
members”, but no names
were mentioned. (
, L20-22) She said
there was no mention of a loan being raised to assist with the purchase of the
shopping centre. (
17 November 2009, the first defendant, Meadow Heights Shopping Centre Group Pty
Ltd (Meadow Heights), was incorporated. (Supplementary
(“SCB”) 61) By a document styled “Sale of Real Estate
Nomination Form” dated 24 November 2009,
the purchaser under the real
estate contract, Mirage Co Pty Ltd, nominated Meadow Heights Shopping Centre
Group Pty Ltd as purchaser.
(CB 901) Mirage, Meadow Heights, the vendor CPT
Custodian Pty Ltd, and the guarantors Messrs Muhsin Tercan and Gazi Sener,
into a deed of variation of the sale contract. It extended the date for
completion of the contract and payment of the residue of
purchase price to 26
February 2010 and increased the sale price, which was modified so as to read
“$12,300,000 (exclusive of
GST if applicable)”, with the deposit
being modified from $600,000 and increased to $900,000. (CB 916)
first defendant, Meadow Heights Shopping Centre Group Pty Ltd, executed a
document styled “Unit Trust Deed” and dated
4 February 2010 as
trustee, along with Mr Gazi, Mr Muhsin Tercan, and Mirage Co Pty Ltd, which were
described as the “original
unit holders” (CB 923-964). According to
Item 6 of the first schedule, Mr Gazi held 1,000 units; Mr Muhsin Tercan held
units; and Mirage held 1,000 units. (CB 958) Certificates for that
unit-holding were to be found in the second schedule to the deed.
(CB 951-961)
The “settled sum” to be identified as Item 5 of the first schedule
(CB 958) was blank.
its defence in this proceeding, Meadow Heights admitted that “in or about
March 2010 [the $250,000 referred to by Mr Senbay]
was paid into the trust
account of [Meadow Heights’] then solicitors.” (CB 44) Also
according to the defence, “in
or about March 2010” the $20,000 on
account of stamp duty referred to by Mr Senbay was paid into Meadow
Heights’ then
solicitors’ trust account. (
Heights then issued a series of unit certificates, in each case signed by Mr
Muhsin Tercan and Mr Gazi Sener as directors of
the trustee company. Their
signatures were headed with the words “Signed in accordance with the rules
that govern the execution
of documents by the Trustee Company on
21/02/2011”. The certificates were as follows:
(a) Certificate No 5, Kemal Sevinc, 250,000 $1.00 ordinary shares fully paid
(b) Certificate No 11, Abdurrahman Kuzucu, 250,000 $1.00 ordinary shares fully
(c) Certificate No 6, Mahmut Tunc, 100,000 $1.00 ordinary shares fully paid
(d) Certificate No 7, Mustafa Okur, 500,000 $1.00 ordinary shares fully paid
(e) Certificate No 4, Ahmet Savran, 250,000 $1.00 ordinary shares fully paid
(f) Certificate No 10, Ilker Abak, 250,000 $1.00 ordinary shares fully paid
(g) Certificate No 11, Ali Kuzucu, 250,000 $1.00 ordinary shares fully paid
(h) Certificate No 12, U&D Future Concepts Pty Ltd, 250,000 $1.00 ordinary
shares fully paid
(i) Certificate No 9, Recep Tercan, 600,000 $1.00 ordinary shares fully paid
(j) Certificate No 3, Mirage Co Pty Ltd, 1,400,000 $1.00 ordinary shares fully
(k) Certificate No 1, Gazi Sener, 4,313,976 $1.00 ordinary shares fully paid
(l) Certificate No 2, Muhsin Tercan, 4,313,976 $1.00 ordinary shares fully
(m) Certificate No 8, Murat Demiral, 500,000 $1.00 ordinary shares fully paid

(o) Certificate 10, Ilker Abak, 250,000 $1.00 ordinary shares fully paid.
14 April 2010, the plaintiff U&D Future Concepts Pty Ltd was incorporated.
The name appears to derive from the given names
of the brothers Senbay. (SCB
Court Book contains documents styled “Application for Units”, each
bearing date 12 February 2010, as follows:
(a) Abdurrahman Kuzucu, 250,000 fully-paid units
(b) Ahmet Savran, 250,000 fully-paid units
(c) Gazi Sener, 4,313,976 fully-paid units
(d) Ilker Abak, 250,000 fully-paid units
(e) Kemal Sevinc, 250,000 fully-paid units
(f) Mahmut Tunc, 100,000 fully-paid units
(g) Mirage Co Pty Ltd, 1,400,000 fully-paid units
(h) Muhsin Tercan, 4,313,976 fully-paid units
(i) Murat Demiral, 500,000 fully-paid units
(j) Mustafa Okur, 500,000 fully-paid units. (CB 967-976)
Australia Bank issued a letter of offer dated 19 April 2010 to Meadow Heights
for a loan of $10,110,000 to be secured by
a registered first mortgage over the
Meadow Heights Shopping Centre, together with a fixed and floating charge over
the assets of
the unit trust company Meadow Heights, together with guarantees
from Mr Gazi and his wife, Mr Muhsin Tercan and members of their
families, and
associated entities, including fixed and floating charges over Mirage Co Pty Ltd
and various pieces of real estate
owned by the Tercan and Sener families and
companies and trusts controlled by them. (CB 1137-1140) This loan was drawn
down presumably
at settlement of the purchase of the shopping centre on 13 May
2010. (CB 1430)
would seem that after Meadow Heights took control of the shopping centre there
were periodic distributions of profits representing
the rental income derived by
Meadow Heights. The Court Book contained a letter from Meadow Heights’
then-solicitors, Zindilis
Barristers & Solicitors, undated and addressed
“To whom it may concern”, stating:
“We have been
advised that U & D Future Concepts Pty Ltd will acquire a 2% share of the
purchasing entity, being Meadow
Heights Shopping Centre Group Pty Ltd. This
equates to one share, totalling $250,000. We have also been advised that U
Future Concepts Pty Ltd has paid all stamp duty applicable in respect of
the share acquisition.
All unitholders who acquire a 2% share of the purchasing entity, will receive
a net return of approximately 9% per annum provided
that all shops on the
premises are tenanted.
Should you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.” (CB
Mr Deha Senbay nor Mr Umit Senbay recognised this document. (T72, L27-29; T92,
L12-26) Mr Gazi gave evidence that at some
point he “combined” the
Meadow Heights Unit Trust with a unit trust operated by Mirage Co Pty Ltd.
(T187-191) Mr Gazi
agreed that Mirage Co Pty Ltd was a trustee of another unit
trust called the Mirage Unit Trust. (T190, L28-29) Its principal assets
properties in Blair Street which were sold in 2015. (T191, L1-2) Some of those
unit holders apparently were not paid out following
the sale of those properties
but were treated as unit holders in the Meadow Heights Unit Trust. (
L7-10) There was no evidence of any consent from the existing Meadow Heights
Unit Trust unit holders. If this evidence be treated
literally, from the moment
of the “combination” the share of rental income available to
existing unit holders such as
the plaintiff in this proceeding would have been
diminished by the fact that there were two additional (former Mirage) unit
now apparently in receipt of part of the rental income. The plaintiff
makes no complaint along these lines, however. Its counsel,
Mr Sharify,
explained it as follows:
“MR SHARIFY: Your Honour, it’s
not a mathematical analysis but my understanding of the unit trust and my
understanding
of how the directors ran it was it was promoted to the eventual
unit holders including my clients as giving a range of return on
rent between 7
to 9 or 6 to 10, and what they tried to do was keep people happy by meeting that
expectation.
HIS HONOUR: Yes.
MR SHARIFY: And it’s not even the case that they actually paid
themselves in accordance with 4.3 million units, that’s
happened. What they’ve done is they’ve kept the paid unit holders
happy - - -
HIS HONOUR: To meet the promised returns, yes, rather than following any
strict shares as per the unit holding, yes.
MR SHARIFY: Precisely.
HIS HONOUR: I understand what you say.
MR SHARIFY: And from a commercial point of view, Your Honour can see the
logic behind that perhaps.” (T277, L1-19)
interpret this concession as meaning that whilst Messrs Gazi and Muhsin Tercan
held the lion’s share of the units in the unit
trust – almost 10
million, dwarfing all other unit-holding – the rental income was
distributed so as to meet the projections
made by Mr Gazi in preliminary
discussions in 2009 rather than allocating the lion’s share of that rental
income to the units
held by Mr Gazi and Mr Muhsin Tercan.
Gazi said that he and his wife paid $225,000 towards the stamp duty on the
transfer of land relative to the shopping centre. He
said that this was
“my share”. (T203, L2-4) He said that these funds were derived from
his “business” –
presumably the shop in Dallas. (
L11-12) The plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Sharify, then took Mr Gazi to an
affidavit which he had sworn in a proceeding in the
Supreme Court which also
raised issues relating to the shopping centre unit trust. At paragraph 36 of
the affidavit, affirmed on
7 October 2022, Mr Gazi said:
total the purchase of the Shopping Centre was funded as follows:
a. funds from investors: $2,850,000
b. funds advanced by NAB: $10,120,000” (SCB 124)
Gazi agreed that these figures totalled $12,970,000. (T203, L29-31) He agreed
that this represented the cost of the shopping centre
including the stamp duty
(T204, L1-4). Mrs Sener, “chipping in” without objection from the
plaintiff’s counsel,
said that an additional $300,000 was payable by way
of penalty interest for late settlement. (
, L7-17) Ultimately, Mr
Gazi agreed that this $300,000 by way of penalty interest was part of the total
cost of the shopping centre
of $12,970,000. (
, L27-29) Mr Gazi then
conceded that the $225,000 on account of stamp duty which he said he and his
wife had paid was in fact the
$300,000 penalty interest, and therefore part of
the total figure of $12,970,000. (T205, L6-13)
Sharify then took Mr Gazi to a set of calculations at CB 3172. In contrast to
the figures just discussed, this page showed the
total stamp duty and purchase
price as totalling $12,977,952. That table is as follows:
PRICE $ 12,300,000.00
$ 677,952.00
TOTAL INVESTMENT $ 12,977,952.00
Unit Holdings
$ 4,313,976.00
Ahmet Savran
$ 250,000.00
Kemal Sevinc
$ 250,000.00
Mahmut Tunc
$ 100,000.00
Mirage Co Pty Ltd
$ 1,400,000.00
Mustafa Okur
$ 500,000.00
Muhsin Tercan
$ 4,313,976.00
Murat Demiral
$ 500,000.00
Recep Tercan
$ 600,000.00
$ 250,000.00
Abdurrahman Kuzucu
$ 250,000.00
U & D Future Concepts Pty Ltd
$ 250,000.00
$ 12,977,952.00
$ 12,977,952.00
will be seen that this allocates some 33.24 per cent of trust equity to Mr Gazi,
a similar percentage to Mr Muhsin Tercan, and
10.78 per cent to Mirage Co Pty
Ltd. Mr Sharify asserted, without contradiction from Mr Gazi, that these were
Mr Gazi’s “own
calculations”. (
observed that the figure $12,977,952 corresponded “to the total unit
holdings”. (T206, L1-2) The units allocated
to Mr Gazi, Mr Tercan,
and Mirage, and $100,000 to Mr Recep Tercan, did not represent any outlays of
cash, actual or virtual, by
those unit holders at the time.
to summarise the thrust of Mr Sharify’s cross-examination at this point,
I told Mr Gazi that the challenge to him was
“you didn’t kick
in [any cash]”. (
, L19) Mr Gazi
“How – if we put anything how we bought the
shopping centre without paying anything? ... but we organise everything,
work for nothing for – I do it for these people, we work for all –
we come together, Mr Tercan and myself, our families
come together, we make this
structure before I met these people. ... I work for nothing.”
enquired if his contention was that he and the other “non-cash” unit
holders had contributed “sweat equity”,
and Mr Gazi
“I work really hard, sir, last 13 years, I was
always, my wife always out, we have to check the shopping centre 24/7.”
(T207, L3-7)
from a claim to “sweat equity”, it would also appear that these
“non-cash” unit holders had contributed
by providing guarantees and
guaranteed security in support of the bank borrowing. (
2018, according to Mr Gazi, three or four unit holders wished to leave –
presumably being “cashed out”: namely
Mr Muhsin Tercan, Mr Okur, and
Mr Abdurrahman Kuzucu. (
, L19-24) Mr Gazi said that Mr Muhsin told
him he wanted to leave “Because I want to retire”. (
L29) According to ASIC records, Mr Muhsin Tercan resigned as a director on 1
March 2017, having served as such since 17 November
2009. He then returned
to office as a director on 10 May 2017, making a final resignation on 3 August
2018. (SCB 62) Asked the
reason for this “coming and going”, Mr
Gazi offered no explanation. (T208-210) There then followed a complex set of
transactions.
3 August 2018 Mr Gazi, Meadow Heights as unit trustee, Mr Muhsin Tercan, and SLE
Finance Pty Ltd entered into a deed styled “Unit
Transfer Deed”. (CB
) Mr Muhsin Tercan was described as the transferor, and SLE was
the transferee. According to Clause 2 of the deed, under the heading
“Purpose of Deed”, it was stated at 2.1(c): “The Transferor
has agreed to transfer the Units [in the unit trust]
to the Transferee in
accordance with this Deed.” (CB 2807)
virtue of Clause 6.3 of the deed, Mr Gazi warranted to “the
Transferor” [
“(c) There is not now nor will there be in the future
any Claim upon the Transferor by the Trustee or any other person for or
behalf of the Trust or arising from any breach by the Trustee of any obligations
to third parties.” (CB 2810)
Gazi also warranted that income in the sum of $234,000 had been paid to
Mr Muhsin Tercan “for the year ending 30 June 2018”.
warranted that “The unpaid amount on the Units transferred pursuant to
this deed as a Completion is $3,672,605.19,
which liability is assumed by the
Transferee [SLE] on Completion.” (CB 2810)
plaintiff, U&D, alleged at paragraph 26 of its Statement of Claim that for
the income years ending 30 June 2011 to 30 June
2018, distributions of income
from the unit trust totalling $1,042,203 had been made in favour of Mr Muhsin
Tercan. In the course
of his opening remarks, Mr Kohn, who appeared as leading
counsel with Mr S Blashki on behalf of the third defendant, Mr Muhsin Tercan,
said that these amounts of income credited to his client had not been received
in the form of cash, but rather went in reduction
of the unpaid face value of
his client’s units in the unit trust. He said it was his client’s
case that he had received
“unpaid units” despite their having been
designated as “fully paid”. (T49, L1-6; T53, L24 – T54, L1)
The purchase price for the unit was $3,340,000. (CB 2816)
transfer form described Mr Muhsin Tercan’s 4,313,976 units as being
“partly paid”. (CB 2818-9)
executed on 3 August 2018 was a document styled “Call Option Deed”
between SLE, Mr Gazi, and Meadow Heights. SLE
was described as the
“owner”. Mr Gazi was described as the “purchaser”. (CB
) Clause 3.1 of the deed stated “The Owner [
hereby grants to the Purchaser [
Mr Gazi] an option to purchase the
Option Units”, which were described as 5,191,181 ordinary units in the
trust. The exercise
price was $4,052,830, and the option was open for exercise
from the date being 12 months and 14 days after 3 August 2018 and ending
calendar months after that date. The Completion Date was expressed as
“The day that is 14 months after the date of this
Deed.” (CB 2647)
A further document executed on the same day,
3 August 2018, was
styled “Specific Security Agreement” and was made between Mr Gazi
and SLE. (CB 2649
) This constituted a mortgagor charge over what were
described as the “Rights”, meaning Mr Gazi’s rights relative
to 3,436,771 “ordinary units” in the unit trust. (CB 2654)
further document executed on the same day was styled “Call Option
Deed”. (CB 2686
) The parties were SLE, Mr Gazi, and Meadow
Heights as unit trustee. Mr Gazi was described as the owner; SLE was the
and Clause 3.1 of the deed provided:
hereby grants to the Purchaser an option to purchase the Option Units for the
Exercise Price.” (CB 2690)
units were described as 3,436,771 ordinary units in the Trust. The exercise
price was $2,211,215, and the option period was the
period from the day
16 months and 14 days after the date of the deed,
3 August 2018,
ending 17 calendar months after that date. (CB 2696)
was a further deed of unit transfer executed. Mr Gazi said that in accordance
with the call option, he had purchased 5,191,181
units from SLE for a price of
$4,052,830. (T200, L24-31) He commented: “This is after Muhsin
left?” (T201, L6) Mr Gazi
agreed that he had Meadow Heights borrow the
money to finance his purchase of Mr Muhsin Tercan’s units, the borrowing
from Westpac Banking Corporation. (T205, L26-29) The effect was that Mr
Gazi was the holder of 44 per cent of the units in the unit
trust, namely
5,727,985. (T216) Mr Gazi was able to acquire more than the original 4.3
million units which Mr Muhsin Tercan owned
which were transferred to SLE
because SLE had purchased 877,205 of Mr Gazi’s units for $1. (T218) Mr
Gazi said he made a reallocation
of units to other people, some of them being Mr
Muhsin Tercan’s former units. He did this “because my accountant
everything like this” (T219-220; especially L4-5 of T220).
Gazi had been pressed with evidence from some unit holders, in particular
Ms Sertel, who complained of a failure on the part of
Meadow Heights as
unit trustee to provide information or documents as to the unit trust holdings
of her and her husband and the larger
unit trust structure. He was also taken
to certain documents which included email complaints made by or on behalf of
holders to similar effect.
Gazi said that he had made proper information available to unit holders, holding
up two disparate sheets of paper which I marked
collectively as Exhibit 1. The
first was a page headed “Share Holders”, which I understood to
be a list of unit holders
(other than Mr Gazi, Mr Muhsin Tercan and Mirage
– that is, unit holders who put in cash), showing their subscriptions to
unit trust and their outlays for stamp duty. I understood this page to
represent the situation as at acquisition of the shopping
centre in 2010. A
second page, dating from a much later date, and apparently an extract from a set
of unit trust accounts, had a
list of unit holders and percentage entitlements.
On that page, under the heading “Distribution of Trust Income”, the
author, presumably the accountant or tax agent who had prepared the document,
“We note you have previously been unable to provide us
with a complete unit holder register. You have however, provided various
holding certificates and a draft register which we have reviewed and attempted
to complete in accordance with your previous
instructions. Accordingly, we note
after numerous telephone discussions and email correspondences you have
confirmed the below unit
holder register is correct per your confirmation in

the accounting versus tax distribution to each of the unit holders for
review as well as the enclosed ATO statement of distribution which we understand
you are obliged to onforward to the relevant
unitholders directly.
We note, remaining in line with the unit holder register, Meadow Heights
Shopping Centre Group Unit Trust distributed its trust income
of $3,850,914 as
followed a table. At a later stage in his cross-examination, Mr Gazi said that
the attached table “records the situation
after 2018” (T221,

to the Statement of Claim, on 20 January 2022 Meadow Heights sold the shopping
centre for $22,000,000 to BAE Corp Nominees
Pty Ltd as Trustee for the BAE Corp
Family Trust “pursuant to a contract entered into on 8 October
2021”. (CB 29, paragraph
37) In its defence, Meadow Heights admitted
these matters. (CB 48, paragraph 37) Mr Deha Senbay, one of the directors of
the plaintiff
U&D, said “I don’t know the exact year, but when
the shopping centre was sold, or before it was sold, there were
rumours ... and
that’s when I became aware of it.” (T78, L23-26) His brother Umit,
the other director, said that he
heard that the shopping centre had been sold
“from waiting outside, the people who are talking, from the mosque, and
when I find out”. (T93, L11-14) According to the evidence of
another unit holder, Mr Okur, he found out about the sale of
the shopping centre
“before one week from settlement. I didn’t hear from Gazi Sener or
Muhsin, ... they didn’t
mention they had sold it.” (T104,
Court Book contained a pro forma letter on the letterhead of Meadow Heights
Shopping Centre dated 27 January 2022 and addressed
to “Dear Unit
Holder” in the following terms:
“I am pleased to inform
you of the sale of the Meadow Heights Shopping Centre for $22 million.
The settlement of the sale recently completed, and the net sale proceeds,
once all encumbrances like the mortgage and other expenses
including sale
expenses are paid, will be paid into the shopping centre’s account by the
end of this week. Once monies are
received, I will immediately arrange for each
unit holder’s capital contribution(s) to be returned to the unit holder
nominated bank account.
Given the only asset of the unit trust, being the shopping centre, has been
sold and the unit trust has achieved its purpose, I intend
to take steps to
finalise the affairs of the shopping centre and close down the trust.
The shopping centre (and trust) will retain monies to pay any ongoing
expenses, costs, and taxes payable to finalise the affairs of
the shopping
centre and trust.
Monies will be retained in the shopping centre’s bank account to cover
these costs. It is unlikely that a further contribution
of monies will be
required from unit holders to meet these costs. Once all expenses, costs and
taxes are paid, the remaining monies
will be distributed to unit holders based
on their percentage of units.” (CB 3067)
Okur said he did not remember receiving this letter. Mr Deha Senbay of U&D
said he was “never sent” this letter.
(T73, L8) His brother Umit
likewise said he had never seen the letter. (T93, L7-13)
Deha Senbay said he received a letter by email from Meadow Heights dated
11 March 2022 (T73, L17-22) which stated as
“Dear U&F [
] Future Concepts Pty Ltd,
Att:Deha Senbay
I refer to previous communications and confirm the Meadow Heights Shopping
Centre has been sold and settlement has been completed.
On or about the
of January 2022, your initial capital investment in the Meadow
Heights Shopping Centre Group Trust (Trust) was returned.
This letter is provided to inform you of your distribution from the
Given your unit holdings, you will receive a payment of $38520.00 on or about
of March 2022. This payment represents your distribution of
the profits achieved by the Trust following the sale of the shopping
centre (and
takes into account the payment of all expenses and taxes).
Any residual monies left in the Trust’s bank account once all trust
related expenses, costs and taxes are paid will be distributed
to unit holders
on or before 30 June 2022.
I confirm the Trust has achieved its purpose and will be wound up in an
orderly manner shortly. There will be no further payments
distributions.” (SCB 47)
Senbay identified what appears to be a page from the accounting journal of the
plaintiff (SCB 4). He said that he believed this
document had been prepared by
U&D’s accountant from a practice separate from Hume Taxation Services
which acted as accountant
and tax agent for Meadow Heights. (T76, L25-31) The
journal identified outlays by U&D of $250,000 for “Purch Units –
Meadow Heights UT” and $20,000 for “Stamp duty paid”, both
said to have been made on 1 July 2010. Mr Senbay said
this was stamp duty
on the purchase of the shopping centre by the trustee Meadow Heights for his
company’s share thereof. (T77,
Senbay said he was unaware of the transactions in 2018 whereby Mr Tercan exited
involvement with the defendant and was “paid
out” for his unit until
“the legal cases started”. (T78, L18-20) The “legal
cases” were the present
proceeding, which was filed last year, and an
earlier proceeding in the Supreme Court brought by Mr Okur and five other unit
Senbay said that U&D’s subscription of $250,000 was funded 50 per cent
from him and 50 per cent from his brother Umit;
, $125,000 each. As
to his share, he said “I borrowed, mortgage”. (T79, L26 – T80,
L1) In addition to the return
of U&D’s original subscription of
$250,000, it was paid an additional $38,000. (T94, L30-31) More specifically,
to the allegations in U&D’s Statement of Claim admitted by
Meadow Heights, the additional capital distribution to U&D
was $38,520. Mr
Gazi received a distribution of $4,339,750, likewise as alleged by the plaintiff
and admitted by Meadow Heights.
Additionally, as alleged in the Statement of
Claim and admitted in the defence filed on behalf of all, save the third
(Mr Muhsin Tercan), Mr Gazi transferred $200,000 to the fifth
defendant, Saliha Sener; $470,000 to the sixth defendant; $600,000
seventh defendant, Dilara Sener; and $1,110,236 to the eighth defendant, Gazsal
Investments Pty Ltd as Trustee of the Gazsal
Investments Unit Trust (a company
controlled by Mr Gazi and his wife Mrs Sener). According to the plaintiff,
these sums were funded
from Mr Gazi’s distribution from the Meadow Heights
Unit Trust. This was not denied by Mr Gazi or Ms Sener.
payment of $200,000 to the fifth defendant, Mrs Sener, was described in the
relevant bank statements as a “dowry”.
(T236, L31 – T237) Mr
and Mrs Sener had been married for over 30 years at this point. By a transfer
instrument dated 22 February
2022, Mr Gazi transferred his interest in his
matrimonial home to his wife for no monetary consideration. (CB 3072-3; T238,
2022, Mr Okur and five other plaintiffs brought proceedings in the Supreme Court
arising out of the events which I have narrated.
This proceeding was settled on
undisclosed terms (Proceeding No S ECI 2022 02257). Giving evidence in
this proceeding, Mrs Sener
began saying “I just want to put on the record
that that money that we put into our children’s accounts as gifts were
redrawn to help us pay for the expenses and the settlement.” (T280,
L28-31) She said that she and her husband had “drawn
down all the
equity” in their house (T281, L15); likewise, the equity in their
children’s houses (
18 June 2024, solicitors acting for the plaintiff U&D filed the writ
commencing this proceeding. It was commenced only after
the resolution of the
Supreme Court proceeding.
this proceeding, all defendants other than Mr Muhsin Tercan were represented by
the law firm Hicks Oakley Chessell Williams. That
firm ceased to act before the
trial. Mr Muhsin Tercan was separately represented by law firm Douros Jackson
Lawyers, and Mr Kohn
and Mr Blashki of counsel represented him at trial.
Kohn, Mr Tercan’s leading counsel, filed an Outline of Opening Submissions
and made a lengthy statement in response to the
opening by plaintiff’s
counsel Mr Sharify. In so far as the plaintiff complained that Mr Tercan
had been “cashed out”
in 2018 for an amount exceeding $3,000,000, Mr
Kohn noted that whilst Mr Tercan had made no cash outlay for the
acquisition of his
units, which were designated as “fully paid”, as
at 2018 he had to his credit, in the books of the unit trust, income
distributions slightly in excess of $1,000,000, with the balance of his payout
to be attributed to the increase in capital value
of the shopping centre.
lunch on Day 1 of the trial, I stood the matter down at the request of counsel
for the plaintiff and the third defendant. At
2.45pm they announced that the
matter as between those parties had been resolved, seeking orders that the
proceeding as between those
parties be struck out with a right of reinstatement
with no order as to costs. Once again, the terms of settlement were not
a general sense, the grievance of the plaintiff U&D and the other unit
holders who brought proceedings in the Supreme Court
is obvious enough. Mr Okur
put the matter in a nutshell:
“After 11 years I got my 500
$500,000] back and 77,000 as a profit, not even a profit because I
paid $27,000 stamp duty. ... And I paid interest to the bank
for that. ... and
at the end ... when you buy the property ... for 12 million and you sold it for
22 million ... And you give peanuts
to the holder, it’s not fair, you have
to be fair.” (T108, L18-20, L30-31; T109, L5-10)
the course of final submissions, Mr Sharify said that the settlement entailed
payment to U&D by Mr Tercan of $65,000 in full
settlement of U&D’s
claim. During the trial, the sixth and seventh defendants, being Mr
Gazi’s son and daughter,
attended remotely by Zoom on some occasions. For
the most part they were absent. Mr Gazi and his wife represented themselves.
Their company Gazsal Pty Ltd, the eighth defendant, was unrepresented.
it is plain that the unit trust operated on the basis of “inside”
unit holders and “outside” unit
holders. The “insiders”
were the directors of Meadow Heights, Messrs Gazi, Muhsin Tercan and Mr
Gazi’s company
Mirage. These received the lion’s share of the
capital distributions in one way or another: in Mr Gazi’s case, with
allocation of over 4,000,000 units with no cash subscription whatsoever –
not even a contribution towards stamp duty on
the acquisition of the shopping
centre. The “insiders” appeared not to have been forthcoming with
information, with
vital matters such as the cashing-out of Mr Muhsin Tercan and
the sale of the shopping centre becoming known only
ex post facto
the plaintiff’s witnesses are to be believed, only by rumour rather than
official notification. Mr Gazi and his wife,
in control of the defendant
trustee company Meadow Heights, were parsimonious with information. The
plaintiff’s witnesses
described their inability to prise comprehensive
documentation from the trustee, Meadow Heights, and those controlling it.
his evidence, Mr Gazi flourished two what I described as “disparate
pages” which became Exhibit 1 as an example of what
he regarded as full
and proper disclosure. The “outsider” unit holders were deprived of
access to the full accounts
of the unit trust.
Cross-examining
Ms Sertel, Ms Sener put it to her that “your husband [Mr Abak] and
yourself repeatedly came to the shop, are
repeatedly kept on saying, ‘We
want to know everything else.’ Do you think that’s fair, did you
think it was a
suspicion that the concern for the “privacy” of unit holders
dictated more by concern that knowledge of the numbers of units allocated and
the circumstances and conditions upon which they
were allocated, if it spread to
the “outsider” unit holders, would create a feeling of grievance at
what might be seen
as inequities as between the “insiders” and the
“outsiders”.
remains to be seen, however, whether the general feeling of grievance on the
part of the plaintiff will equate with effective causes
of action yielding the
relief sought.
Statement of Claim
its Statement of Claim filed with the writ, U&D first alleged and described
the circumstances in which the second defendant,
Mr Gazi, approached investors
to fund the purchase of the Meadow Heights Shopping Centre with his company,
Mirage, entering into
a contract for the purchase of the centre. Next, the unit
trust is described, with the first defendant as trustee. Various provisions
the trust deed are recited and alleged, as well as the following duties said to
have been incumbent on Meadow Heights in the
circumstances:
“16. At all material times, the Trustee Company
had a duty to:
the terms of the Trust Deed;
act in the best financial interests of all of the beneficiaries of the Unit
not use its position as Trustee to obtain any advantage or gain for itself or a
third party;
act impartially between the beneficiaries, including between present and future
beneficiaries of the Unit Trust;
render accounts and provide verification on information in rendered accounts
upon the request of the beneficiaries;
exercise its discretionary powers fairly and honestly and for the purposes for
which the discretionary powers were conferred and
not to accomplish any ulterior
was said that the units issued to Mr Gazi, Mr Muhsin Tercan, Mr Gazi’s
company Mirage, and Recep Tercan, were “fraudulently
it was said that in so far as income distributions were made to Mr Gazi,
Mr Muhsin Tercan, and Mirage, such distributions “were
in breach of
trust as Gazi, Muhsin and Mirage were not Unit Holders or beneficiaries of the
Unit Trust”. Therefore, these
parties “were knowing recipients of
the distributions ... within the meaning of the first limb of
.” (CB 24-25)
to the transactions in 2018 and 2019 which saw Mr Muhsin Tercan resign as a
director of the trustee Meadow Heights and be “cashed
out” for his
units, which the Statement of Claim described as “buy back
transactions”, these were said to be breaches
of trust because it was said
Mr Muhsin Tercan was not a unit holder, as he had not paid the required $1 per
unit for his units or
alleged units, and it was said “clause 28 of the
Trust Deed requires a unanimous resolution of unit holders for a unit holder
cancel units and be paid [their] value by the Trustee Company”. (CB 26-27)
It was alleged these transactions were in breach
of other specific provisions of
the Trust Deed, and borrowing money from Westpac Banking Corporation “was
for the purpose of
benefiting Gazi and/or Muhsin, rather than the interests of
all of the beneficiaries of the Unit Trust.” (CB 28) The funds
repay Westpac “would otherwise have been available for distribution to
[U&D] as Rental Income or as proceeds of
the sale of the Shopping
Centre.” (Paragraph 36a, CB 28-29)
regards the sale of the shopping centre, the termination of the trust and
distribution of capital, according to the Statement of
Claim: “The
purported termination of the Unit Trust by the Trustee Company was in breach of
clause 29 of the Trust Deed.”
It said a unanimous resolution of the unit
holders was required for the early determination of the trust. It was alleged
that in so far as Mr Gazi’s units or purported units were
invalid, the distribution to him was a breach of trust. It was said
was part of a fraudulent design, as witness the fact that “the Trustee
Company did not inform the Plaintiff that
the Trustee Company would issue the
Fraudulently Obtained Unit Holdings” [
, Mr Gazi’s units].
It was said that Mr Gazi was a knowing recipient of moneys paid in breach of
trust “within the meaning
of the first limb of
”. It said, likewise, the distribution of $2,000,000 to Erdal
Demir, “$1,325,000 of which were attributable to Erdal
Demir’s unit
holdings in Mirage”, was a breach of trust, as “Mirage was not a
unit holder or a beneficiary of the
Unit Trust.” This breach was said to
have been fraudulent.
it was said that Mr Muhsin Tercan “knowingly assisted or procured the
breaches of trust” associated with the issue
of the non-cash units. It
alleged he was a knowing assistor within the second limb of
Gazi was said to have knowingly assisted all of the breaches of trust alleged,
being a director of the Trustee Company,
Meadow Heights, at all
material times.
it was alleged that Mr Gazi and Mr Muhsin Tercan should be regarded as promoters
“of the investment scheme in the Shopping
Centre which was ultimately
constituted by the Unit Trust”, and as such owed fiduciary duties to
U&D which it was said
they had breached by the issue of the
“non-cash” unit holding and received secret profits. (CB 32-33)
(CB 34-38), claims were brought in reliance on the equitable process of tracing
against the various defendant members of Mr
Gazi’s family, including his
wife, his son, and his daughter.
way of relief, the Statement of Claim sought a suite of orders against the
defendant including equitable compensation, an account
of profits, and
declarations that the various properties whose mortgages had been paid down were
held on constructive trust for the
their defence dated 2 August 2024, the defendants other than the third defendant
(Muhsin Tercan) broadly admit the steps taken
relative to the Unit Trust and the
purchase of the shopping centre. They referred in particular to Clause 18 of
the Unit Trust Deed,
which provided that “no Unit Holder shall be entitled
to the transfer to him of any property comprised in the Fund except as
provided herein.” They admitted the issue of 4,313,976 units to Mr Gazi
and a like number to Mr Muhsin Tercan, together
with $1,400,000 to Mirage, but
otherwise denied the allegations that such issues were invalid or unlawful or
that their creation
entailed breaches of duty by Meadow Heights. They referred
to Clause 43b of the Trust Deed.
to the transactions in 2018, they said that Mr Muhsin Tercan, Mirage, and Gazi
“constituted a majority of holders of units
in the Unit Trust at 3 August
2018”, and that Muhsin Tercan and Gazi consented to the transactions.
to what was described as “the shopping centre venture”, they
referred to the purchase of the centre, stating that:
Gazi and Muhsin [Tercan] agreed:
would purchase the Shopping Centre;
and Muhsin would share in the profits of running the centre and any future
profit on the sale of the Shopping Centre;
and Muhsin would guarantee the repayment of the borrowings incurred to purchase
the Shopping Centre;
and Muhsin would provide security for the guarantees and/or the borrowings
required for the purchase of the Shopping Centre”
(CB 51, paragraph 79)
said, at paragraph 84, attempts by these parties to raise the necessary finance
to pay the “entire price” for the
shopping centre were unavailing,
and accordingly:
“In or around November 2009, Gazi and Muhsin
agreed that they would approach members of the Turkish community to discuss the
possibility of them investing money to purchase the Shopping Centre, by which
the investors would receive a share in the purchasing
company equal to the money
they contributed to the purchase price plus an annual return on their investment
depending on the amount
invested.” (Paragraph 85, CB 52)
referred (paragraphs 86-87) to the incorporation of the first defendant, Meadow
Heights, and its nomination as purchaser, and
said that Meadow Heights, Gazi and
Muhsin agreed that:
“i. any further investors would, once
their investment was accepted by Gazi, Muhsin and Mirage, receive a percentage
Shopping Centre Venture equal to the money they contributed to the
purchase price plus an annual return on their investment depending
on the amount
invested; and
and Muhsin would have the remaining share of the Shopping Centre Venture.”
they said (paragraphs 88-89, CB 54) that “in or about November 2009”
Mr Deha Senbay and Mr Gazi “had a discussion”
investment in the shopping centre. This was described as the “Dallas
Photo Discussion”. At paragraph 89
the following was said to have
transpired:
“89. During the Dallas Photo Discussion:
told Gazi that he had heard about the possibility of investing in the Shopping
Centre from other people interested in investing
and that he was interested in
investing as well;
told Deha that he, Mirage and Muhsin wanted to buy the Shopping Centre and Deha
could have an opportunity to do the same if he
had money to invest;
told Deha that he and Muhsin had contributed money by the deposit through Mirage
and had by arranging a bank loan through NAB
using their own properties as
told Deha if he invested, the return on the investment to Deha would be about
7-8% per annum from the shop rents after expenses
and paying bank loan
told Deha that if he invested, he would have a share of the entity owning the
Shopping Centre;
told Deha that his share of the entity would equal the amount Deha put in as a
share of the price of the Shopping Centre including
costs. Each investor
putting in $250,000 would have a 2% share of the investment in the entity in
return for that size investment;
told Deha that each investor would also have to contribute to the stamp duty on
the Shopping Centre purchase;
told Deha that when the Shopping Centre was sold the proceeds would be shared
proportionately to their contribution after paying
back the bank and sale
expenses.” (Paragraph 89, CB 53)
said the Unit Trust was established by the Trust Deed “on 4 February
2010” (paragraph 90, CB 53-54). They said Meadow
Heights having been
nominated as purchaser of the shopping centre “on or about 24 November
2009” (paragraph 87, CB 52):
“the Unit Trust received
from [Meadow Heights] the Shopping Centre Venture comprising among other
opportunity to purchase the Shopping Centre;
interest of [Meadow Heights] in the Shopping Centre as buyer under the Original
Purchase Contract;
benefit of the deposit paid by Mirage under the Purchase Contract;
benefit of the security each of Muhsin, Gazi and Mirage had agreed to provide to
secure finance to purchase the Shopping Centre.”
referred to various provisions of the Trust Deed as to the creation and issue of
units. They referred to the “non-cash”
units having been issued to
Gazi, Muhsin Tercan, and Mirage “on or about 12 February 2010”
(paragraph 93, CB 56), and
“In or about February 2011 [Mr
Senbay’s] units were issued to UDFC [the plaintiff] upon his
request.” (CB 57)
They said (paragraph 98,
) that Mr Gazi
managed the shopping centre until sold, and the Unit Trust “including the
monthly distribution of payments to
Unit Holders”; he managed the sale,
and completion of the sale, of the shopping centre, and the sale by Muhsin of
in the Unit Trust. According to paragraph 99 of the defence, from
purchase until 2018 the net income of the Unit Trust was distributed
plaintiff “proportionately to its Unit Holding” “by monthly
bank cheque”.
to the exit of Mr Muhsin Tercan (paragraph 101, CB 57), the defence stated
“In or about 2018, [Meadow Heights] sought a loan
from Westpac Bank
for the purpose of purchasing Muhsin’s units in the Unit Trust”,
and, failing, sought finance “from
a private lender, SLE Finance”.
(Paragraph 102, CB 57)
to paragraph 103 of the defence, on 3 August 2018 Meadow Heights “took a
loan from SLE Finance”, setting out
detailed steps and requirements of the
transaction, including a Call Option Deed as to the units then held by SLE
granted to Mr Gazi.
They admitted that he exercised that option “to
acquire the units then held by SLE Finance”. (CB 60) Paragraph 104
that Meadow Heights “took a loan from Westpac Banking Corporation ... of
$4,495,530 which was taken for the purpose
of ... paying the exercise price
under the Call Option Deed; paying interest to SLE Finance ...; and paying
income distributions
due to SLE Finance as a unit holder” and also
“to the costs of shopping centre bathroom and façade repairs and
addition to the business overdraft funds available for the operation of the
to paragraph 105, “In October 2019 the Westpac Loan was drawn down and
used to repay SLE Finance in the sum of $4,052,830”,
and SLE’s units
were “redistributed ... proportionately to the remaining unit holders ...:
2,291,214 to Gazi; 933,374
to Mirage, and 166,637 to [the plaintiff].”
Thereafter, the income of the Unit Trust was applied first in payment of

holding units based on their unit holdings”. (Paragraph
107, CB 60)
the sale of the shopping centre completed 20 January 2022, the purchase price
was applied first to pay Westpac; secondly, “the
Capital Contribution of
each unit holder was returned”; and third, “proportionately to each
of the Unit Holders then

following amounts to the Unit Holder or at the direction of

they said that if the payments were held to be in breach of trust (which they
nevertheless denied), then the defendants (aside
from the third defendant) said
“that the [

claims against the sixth defendant, Mr Sadik Sener, and his sister, Dilara
Sener, may be dealt with speedily at the outset. U&D
seeks to trace the
payments made to Mr Gazi from the sale proceeds of the shopping centre which
were paid to them. Alternatively,
U&D seeks an “
” remedy against them.
Professor Dal Pont,
Equity in Trusts in Australia
Equitable tracing rules require proof
of a breach of fiduciary duty ..., a clear succession to the property contrary
to the relationship
giving rise to that duty, and that the property remains
identifiable. ...
But where the continued existence of the property being traced is not
established, equity “is as helpless as the common law
[1948] Ch 465
Equitable tracing presupposes “the continued existence of the money either
as a separate fund or as part of a mixed
fund or as latent in property acquired
by means of such a fund”. Hence, where it is sought to trace in equity,
it is necessary
to determine whether the money or property sought to be traced
has a continued existence, actual or notional, sufficient to enable
grant specific relief. If the property has been dissipated, the remedy ends
(without prejudice to a personal claim against
the defaulting trustee). For
this reason, it is said that equitable tracing cannot be pursued through an
overdrawn bank account
– such an account is not an asset at all, but a
liability ...” (1221−2)
the case of both siblings, the payments were made into their mortgage loan
accounts, which were in debit.
Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd (in liquidation) v Homan
211, the liquidators of Bishopsgate, which was the trustee of various company
pension funds relative to a public company
group controlled by the late Mr
Robert Maxwell, sought to trace the proceeds of money improperly taken from the
pension funds into
a bank account of Maxwell Communication Corporation plc. The
Court of Appeal, Dillon, Leggatt and Henry LJJ, rejected this attempt.
“On the unexpected death of Robert Maxwell on 5
November 1991 it was discovered that very large amounts of pension fund moneys
of B.I.M. [Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd] had been improperly paid,
during his lifetime, directly or indirectly into various
bank accounts of the
private sector companies and of M.C.C. with National Westminster Bank. At the
time of each wrongful payment
of B.I.M.’s pension fund moneys into
M.C.C.’s accounts those accounts were overdrawn, or later became
overdrawn. It
was also found that M.C.C. was hopelessly insolvent.”
([1995] Ch 211, 215)
to the headnote in the Law Reports:
“Equitable tracing cannot
be pursued through an overdrawn and therefore non-existent fund, nor can
misappropriated money be
traced into an asset bought before the money was
received by the purchaser.” ([1995] Ch 211)
take the word “overdrawn” to refer not merely to a debit balance in
a classic overdraft account where a bank’s
customer is authorised by the
bank to draw cheques against the account calculated to bring the account into
debit up to an approved
limit; rather, it is a reference to any account which is
in debit. When a payment is used to extinguish or reduce an outstanding
debit balance, the debit and credit annihilate one another either completely or
. The credit balance ceases to exist, and therefore cannot be
the subject of the tracing process.
claim against the children based on tracing therefore fails.

received without consideration and as volunteers

that is, the liability attached to them as individuals, rather than deriving
from the continued existence of a piece of property
being money paid away in
breach of some equitable rule. Mr Sharify, on behalf of the plaintiff, relied
on a decision of the New

Handley AJA) in
Heperu Pty Ltd v Belle

case, a fraudster took cheques which the plaintiff company had given him to
invest, and deposited them in accounts in his
wife’s name controlled by
him. Funds were withdrawn to make mortgage payments on properties in his
wife’s name and in
their joint names. The Court held that the wife as
“an innocent volunteer” was under an equitable obligation
her conscience” to restore to the plaintiff the proceeds
of the misappropriated funds that could be traced into her real estate
date she received notice of the claim. According to Allsop P, with whom the
other two judges concurred, the obligation on
the wife, Ms Belle, attached to
her to the extent “she retained the funds or their traceable products when
she had notice of
the claim”. ((2009)

Closing Submissions (paragraph 110), Mr Sharify said:
personam liability can be established by a recipient of fiduciary property who
is ignorant of the origin of the property
at the time of receipt but then
obtains knowledge of the fiduciary nature of the property subsequently”.
continued (paragraphs 112-113):
“For the purposes of this
proceeding, the plaintiff says it is safer for the court to find the date at
which the relevant knowledge
was acquired as being the date of the defence that
was filed on behalf of the Gazi Defendants including the Children Parties in
of which tracing claims were made. ...
The date of that defence is 7 February 2023 ...”

way, were spent by the children when their mortgage debt was paid down, these

oral submissions, Mr Sharify contended that there was a distinction between a
scenario where, on the one hand, a volunteer receiving
misappropriated trust
funds in good faith spent them to pay down a fixed loan, and, on the other hand,
where the loan paid down included
a “redraw” facility as was
apparently the case here. As a matter of principle, it is difficult to see why
this should
make any difference. A volunteer recipient of misappropriated funds
would be able to resist a claim for repayment if he or she spent
the money to
pay off a debt owing for goods sold and delivered. Would it make any difference
if the seller of the goods had a running
account with the buyer/volunteer?
Surely not. Exercise of a right of “redraw” under a mortgage
facility constitutes
the taking out of a new loan not “unspending”
the previous repayments. The claim against the siblings, therefore, fails
as being based on tracing and as being mounted
Allocation of cashless units
noted above [60], paragraph 16 of the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim
asserted a duty on the defendant trustee company:
impartially between the beneficiaries, including between present and future
beneficiaries of the Unit Trust”.
defendants, including Meadow Heights, admitted the existence of such a duty.
According to Professor Dal Pont:
“The duty of impartiality,
broadly speaking, prohibits a trustee acting to favour one class of
beneficiaries at the expense
of another.” (
, [22.120] 679)
duty arises typically relative to the respective rights and entitlements of life
tenants of properties relative to those with
an interest in the same property in
remainder. According to the Professor, this duty “can be likened to that
of company directors
not to act sectionally or partially by favouring one
section of shareholders over another”, citing

the present instance, the trustee Meadow Heights administered the trust funds
such that, despite having a power to create different
classes of units, it
discriminated within the one and only class, which it might be supposed would
, such that one (outsider) class was required to pay cash
“upfront” for each of its $1 units and to contribute to the
stamp duty on the trust’s sole or principal asset, the shopping centre;
while another (insider) class was permitted
to receive its units without cash
outlay, and, in the case of Mr Tercan, to be “cashed out” at more
than three times
the amount of his accrued but unpaid income distribution, or,
in the case of the rest of the “insider” group, to receive
of the full face-value of their “fully paid” units with no cash
outlay at all. The logic of the Plaintiff’s
case is that the accrued
income in excess of $1m put against Mr Tercan’s units as a part payment
for their face value ought
not to have been allocated to him in the first place
because he made no initial cash subscription. This was an egregious breach of
duty by Meadow Heights.
his opening remarks, Mr Kohn, on behalf of the third defendant, and Mr Gazi and
his wife in their evidence and oral presentation,
contended that there was full
disclosure to all unit holders, who therefore should be regarded as having given
their informed consent
to this arrangement. The evidence of the
plaintiff’s witnesses summarised above is in the teeth of that contention.
them recalled receiving any explanation as to the proposed issue of
millions of “cashless” units which would rank
their units, for which dollar-for-dollar cash subscription was required. Nor
was there an explanation that the “outsider”
group was to meet the
stamp duty liability from which the “insider” group was exempt. Mr
Gazi and Ms Sener gave evidence
in the most general terms to the effect that
they made full explanation. They referred to lengthy consultations at Mr
shop and discussions at a dinner attended by unit holders, though
this seems to have been after settlement of the purchase and therefore
U&D and the other “outsider” unit holders had outlaid their
money and therefore committed to the unequal regime.
(T86, L18-22) Mr Deha
Senbay said he did not remember attending this dinner. (T98, L14-16) Mr Gazi
put it to Mr Okur “...
we settled, and we went to dinner. You saw me and
the director, you saw Mr Muhsin, director, as well?” Mr Okur said
(T107, L22-24) Whilst Mr Gazi cross-examined the
plaintiff’s witnesses along these lines, none of them agreed that they had
received a comprehensive explanation of the situation and the relative rights of
the “insider” and “outsider”
Gazi called Mr Fahri Karabulut, one of his friends of 20 years’ standing
(T278, L16-17), who described how he had been approached
by Mr Gazi to invest in
the shopping centre but had been unable to raise the money. He described coming
to Mr Gazi’s shop
in 2009/2010. (
, L18-19). Mr Karabulut said
that Mr Gazi had explained “everything” to him. (
I suggested the witness should describe specifically what had been explained to
him, and he replied:
“You [Mr Gazi] were explaining to me how
much profit was incoming. And that was a good profit, at that time it was about
per cent income, that was a good profit, I was happy to join, that’s
why I said to even ask my missus for us to join together
but at that time we
couldn’t find the money.” (T478, L31 – T479, L6)
“And also did I explain to you our company, like
Meadow Heights, Mirage and my partner, Muhsin Terjan [
and Mr Karabulut replied:
“Yes, you did say to me, you explained everything, how much I pay, how
much I get. ... I couldn’t get the money out,
if I could get the money
out I could do it, I couldn’t do it, I missed it.” (T279, L7-14)
Karabulut described no explanation of the intended issue of millions of
“cashless” units to Messrs Gazi and Tercan.
Nor the implications
which this would have for the prospects of capital gain for those who subscribed
cash “on the nail”.
I conclude therefore that there was no full and
proper explanation to the “outsider” group of unit holders.
Mr Gazi’s re-examination, I asked him how the unit trust investment was
“sold” to unit holders, explaining
the difference between a pure
debt investment on the one hand, where the relevant debt and interest was
repayable independent of
the profitability of the enterprise which owed the
debt, as distinct from an equity investment, which depended for its return upon
the profitability of the relevant asset or enterprise. In the present instance,
I noted that returns to unit trust holders would
depend upon the level of
rentals and vacancy rates in the shopping centre. (T267-8) I enquired whether
the unit trust investment
was offered as a debt security or as an equity
investment. Mrs Sener, “chipping in”, said it was an equity
investment.
In the course of my explanation of the distinction between the two,
I noted that equity investments carry with them the prospect
and hope of
capital gains. In this instance, the structuring of the unit trust, which was
effectuated by Meadow Heights in its allocation
of the cash-free units, created
a regime where the underlying asset almost doubled in value over a period of
just over a decade,
but the capital gains thereby arising to unit holders were
reserved almost exclusively for the “insiders” who received
cash-free units.
have already found that the “outsider” unit holders did not receive
any explanation of this phenomenon, or that their
equity in the shopping centre
would be dwarfed by cash-free units allocated to the “insiders”. Mr
Kohn, in his opening
statement on behalf of the third defendant, contended that
since the initial unit holders were all “insiders” and were
agreeable to this arrangement, it had been the subject of unanimous consent and
full disclosure.
previously noted, the unit trust certificates were all dated 21/02/2011
([16] above). This is the year following the acquisition
of the shopping
centre by Meadow Heights. It may be inferred that the issue of these units and
their bearing a date in February
2011 was the completion of a mere formality,
with the substance of the subscription and allocation having taken place the
year. Mr Sharify accordingly contended (Closing Submissions,
paragraph 19) that U&D became a unit holder no later than 13 May
the purchase of the shopping centre was completed. He referred to an affidavit
made by Mr Sener in the Supreme Court.
(SCB 124, paragraph 36) Again, the way
in which the unit trust certificates were issued implies that the creation of
units with which we are concerned in this proceeding occurred
simultaneously, or at any rate in a manner such that the evidence does
indicate any basis for contending that the cash units were created or issued
after the non-cash units. In these circumstances,
I reject the contention that
there was either a full disclosure to all equity holders at the time of the
issue of the non-cash units
or that there had been a full disclosure of the
distinct features of the creation and issue of these non-cash units. According
Mr Sharify, once the “cashless” units were eliminated from the
equation U&D was entitled to 8.7 per cent of the equity
of the unit
Knowing assistance
sought findings that the breach or breaches of trust which I have found Meadow
Heights engaged in as trustee were knowingly
assisted by Mr Gazi and Mr Muhsin
as the trustees’ directors. Since the proceeding as regards Mr Muhsin has
been settled,
I put the allegations of knowing assistance against him to one
Gazi made no bones about his having been in control of the shopping centre and
all its elements, and hence of the unit trust.
In his closing statement, he
“... we bought this shopping centre 2010, so I work very
hard, my wife help me, whole family, it’s ruined by that. They
two years I work, I worked 12 years nonstop.” (T327, L26-29)
“You know, burglary come, someone broken the window,
24/7, sometimes water, so I work more than 12 years, so I work for nothing
understanding.” (T328, L20-22)
whilst Mr Gazi attributed the structuring of the unit trust to “the
accountants”,
Hume Taxation Services, it was implicit that it
was he who implemented that structuring advice. (T163-4) In effect, what Meadow
Heights did as trustee was done through the human agency of Mr Gazi. There can
be no clearer example of knowing assistance.
claims relief against Mr Gazi, seeks relief against him as one who knowingly
assisted in Meadow Heights’ breaches of
trust under the principle laid

, 252, where Lord Selborne LC
said that one who assisted a defaulting trustee “with knowledge in a
dishonest and fraudulent
design on the part of the trustees” was liable to
those aggrieved as an accessory to the breach of trust. (Dal Pont
[38.65]) Professor Dal Pont, in the paragraph already cited, noted that the
most recent High Court authority on the subject, namely
Farah Constructions
Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd
(2007) 230 CLR 89
, focused attention upon the
knowledge of the alleged accessory, rather than any fraudulent intent on the
accessory’s part.
the present instance, since Mr Gazi was a directing mind of Meadow Heights as
one of its directors until 2018 with Mr Muhsin and
continued to be a director,
claiming, as I have already quoted, to have been the directing mind and the
person running the entire
enterprise, including the unit trust, his knowledge
was plenary.
far as fraudulent intent is concerned, the effect of Mr Gazi’s evidence
was to deny any impropriety whatsoever in what he
and Meadow Heights had done.
Despite this, I have found that the cash unit holders, including U&D and its
two directors, being
the brothers Senbay, by omission, in failing to disclose
the status of the non-cash unit holders, including himself. Resistance to
provision of full documentation, lead me to infer that Mr Gazi was at pains to
conceal the inequitable arrangements which he
and Meadow Heights had made
relative to the non-cash, as distinct from the cash, unit holders. It is proper
to infer a dishonest
intent from these matters. The non-disclosure to the cash
unit holders of events such as the buying-out of Mr Muhsin and his units,
the lack of disclosure of the sale of the shopping centre except
, give further colour to the issue. I reject the proffered explanation
that these matters occurred because of some concern for the
“privacy” of the unit holders.
against Mr Gazi, U&D seek “an account of profits or a declaration of a
constructive trust in respect of the $6,009,921
paid by [Meadow Heights] to Gazi
in 2011-2022 in proportion to the Plaintiff’s unit holdings” (CB
38), an equitable compensation
for distributions made by Meadow Heights to Mr
Erdal Demir on 27 January 2022 (following the sale of the shopping centre),
Mirage in the period 2019 to 2021. Mr Sharify did not elaborate upon the
basis for the remedy or precisely how it would be applied
in the present
instance. According to the editors of
Meagher, Gummow & Lehane’s
Equity Doctrines and Remedies (4
“A fiduciary who profits from breach of duty is liable to
account for the profit made within the scope and ambit of the duty
International Ltd v Dwyer
[1995] HCA 18
(1995) 182 CLR 544
at 559) or repay it as an
equitable debt.”
in the same paragraph (page 202), the learned editors
“A fiduciary in breach of duty must account for profits
made by that fiduciary. A knowing participant in the fiduciary’s
of duty must account for profits made by the participant. But is the
participant also liable to account for the profits the
fiduciary made? The
question is a significant one where the fiduciary’s assets have been
dissipated after the wrong but before
the present instance, as I understand U&D’s case it is that the profit
was made by the knowing participant, namely Mr
Gazi, rather than the trustee,
which simply made distribution. For the reasons that have led me to conclude
that for the purposes
of the rule in
Barnes v Addy
Mr Gazi should be
regarded as having knowingly assisted Meadow Heights’ breaches of trust,
he should for the purposes of the
principle just stated, be regarded as a
knowing participant. I take the two, at least in the present context, to
be synonymous one
with the other.
claims for relief quoted would appropriately be made in favour of all the
non-cash unit holders if they were plaintiffs in the
present proceeding. In
this proceeding only U&D is plaintiff, and therefore U&D is entitled to
an account of profits proportional
only to its percentage entitlement to the
trust property. According to Exhibit 1, which was tendered by Mr Gazi,
describing the
unit holders as “share holders”, U&D was entitled
to 1.92 per cent of the trust’s equity. After 2018 and the
“buyout” of Mr Muhsin Tercan, according to the defendants’
view U&D was entitled to 3.21 per cent of the equity,
having received a
reallocation of Mr Muhsin Tercan’s former units with the
result that, according to the second page of Exhibit 1, U&D was
of some 416,637 units, representing 3.21 per cent of the equity.
U&D’s case was that when the non-cash units
were excluded from the
calculation, U&D’s share of the equity increased to 8.7 per cent.
(T300, L16-17)
Sharify conceded that an allowance ought to be made for Mr Gazi’s work in
managing the centre; however, he noted that for
all but the first two years the
following persons – namely Harun Bultan, Arzu Tercan, and Dilara Sener
– were employed
as centre managers and paid approximately $75,000 per
annum. These matters emerged in his cross-examination of Mr Gazi at T249-257.
As noted above, Mr Gazi protested that these concessions scarcely did justice to
his efforts in management. He was particularly
critical of the first individual
employed as a centre manager.
to the security provided by Mr Gazi, he said that it had a face value of
$1,153,000. (Closing Submissions, paragraphs 90-91,
CB 1021) For the purposes
of National Australia Bank’s submission to its credit approval authority,
Mr Gazi as guarantor of
the borrowing was assessed by the bank as having gross
assets of $2,100,000 and liabilities of $857,000, leaving net assets of
$1,153,000.
There may be grounds to debate whether this represents the most
appropriate way of allocating value to Mr Gazi as providing guarantee
security for Meadow Heights’ borrowing. I agree, however, with Mr
Sharify, who said that guarantee security ought not be accorded
the same value
dollar-for-dollar as a cash subscription for units in a unit trust. I agree.
Had the guarantors paid out the bank,
they would have been entitled to a
transfer of the bank’s security, and the guarantor’s outlays would
have been payable
by Meadow Heights.
Sharify, in his Closing Submissions (paragraph 93), said:
is submitted that a 30% allowance is a generous and maximum amount which the
court should grant in this case.”
the account of profits, he said (paragraph 96), should, having been discounted
by 30 per cent to reflect an appropriate
allowance for Mr Gazi’s efforts
and for his provision of security, would entitle U&D to $366,004.19 as to
this portion
of its relief claim. Despite Mr Sharify’s contention that 30
per cent should be seen as an absolute ceiling for Mr Gazi’s
allowance, I
believe it should be set at 35 per cent.
next piece of relief sought against Mr Gazi by U&D is equitable
compensation.
According to Professor Dal
Where a breach of trust causes loss to
the trust estate, the trustee is liable to restore the trust estate to the
position it would
have been in absent the breach. ...
... where the trust has been terminated and the fund distributed, the date of
assessment is the date of final distribution of the
trust estate.” (
, [24.30] 726-7)
in the same chapter the Professor said:
a trustee commits a breach of trust causing a loss to the trust estate, the
beneficiaries have the right to have the trust
fund properly administered and
any misplaced assets restored to the trust. If, however, the same breach
occurred in respect of a
bare trust ..., the beneficiary is effectively the
owner of the property and is not ordinarily entitled to restitution of the fund
but instead to compensation payable directly to her or him measured by the
amount of the loss attributable to the breach.”
learned author cites
Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns (a firm)
[1995] UKHL 10
, 433-4, per Lord Browne-Wilkinson. In this instance, the trust had been
terminated and wound up. Each beneficiary is therefore
the absolute owner of
the property or funds distributed to him, her or it, and therefore a proper
first item for which compensation is sought pertains to Mr Erdal Demir.
Paragraph 111 of the defence by Mr Gazi and his associates
admits distributing
some $2,430,000 to Mr Demir inclusive of principal and interest, after first
having paid out the mortgage loan
owing to Westpac Banking Corporation and
returning the capital contribution of each unit holder. (CB 61) His involvement
to derive, at least in part, from the “combination” of the
Mirage Unit Trust referred to at [21] above. As noted in
that paragraph,
U&D makes no complaint about income distributions relative to this
“combination”, whatever that process
must say I am unable to understand the process that was purportedly undertaken.
My attention was drawn to no evidence of those
unit holders having made a cash
contribution to the Meadow Heights Unit Trust, nor (if it matters) of their
having provided any management
services to the trustee. Whether those unit
holders were involved in any way in providing security to Westpac Banking
Corporation
relative to the borrowing undertaken to facilitate Mr Muhsin
Tercan’s exit from the trust does not appear. However, since
transaction for the benefit of one of the “insider” unit holders and
not for the unit holders as a whole,
the incongruity of what apparently happened
would be in no way diminished even if these ex‑Mirage unit holders had
guarantee security to Westpac. In the course of his closing
submissions I asked Mr Sharify if I correctly characterised the
plaintiff’s
case relative to him:
“... your case is that
there is just no legal concept of combining trusts the way this was done and
that no money flowed from
the Mirage trust to the Meadow Heights trust, and so
this pay out to Demir was just indefensible.”
Mr Sharify said:
“Yes.” (T326, L27 – T327, L2)
Demir is not a party to the proceeding, and so there is no claim against him
either by way of tracing or
in personam
. As far as the process of
“combining” the Mirage Trust and the Meadow Heights Trust, I have
found no distinct allegations
as to this in the Statement of Claim. Rather,
there is a reference in the prayer for relief without any preliminary
explanation
as to these matters. (CB 38) According to paragraph 46 of the
Statement of Claim (CB 30), Meadow Heights “distributed $1,325,000
Mirage”. The particulars to this paragraph state that the distribution to
Mr Demir was $2 million, $1,325,000 of which
“were attributable to Erdal
Demir’s unit holdings in Mirage”. The admitted distribution to
Erdal Demir is, as
previously noted, $2,430,000. The amount for which
compensation is sought being 8.7 per cent of that figure, Mr Gazi said of
Demir “He put almost $2 million”. (T333, L9) I asked him if this
was a subscription to the Meadow Heights Unit Trust
or the Mirage Unit Trust.
He said he could provide documentation evidencing this subscription, and I gave
him until close of business
3 November to provide that evidence.
Gazi sent an email on the afternoon of 3 November stating “please find
unit certificate for Erdal Demir confirming transfer
of units Erdal
Demir”. The email covered a document headed “Meadow Heights
Shopping Centre Group Unit Trust” showing
Erdal Demir as having 833,360
units, that is approximately twice the number of units as U&D which,
according to this calculation,
held 416,637. Also attached was a unit transfer
form, being a transfer for $675,000 from Murat Demiral to Mr Demir “in his
own capacity and as trustee of the Erside Family Trust”. The document was
signed 4 March 2020. These documents do not establish
that Mr Demir, or his
predecessor Mr Demiral, subscribed $2 million or any number of dollars to the
Meadow Heights Unit Trust.
I conclude that the distribution to Mr Demir by Meadow Heights was also made
against a “cashless” unit holder.
It represented a further breach
of Meadow Heights’ duty “to act impartially between the
beneficiaries”. One group
received its distribution based on cash
subscriptions and the others were given distributions based on
“cashless” units.
Mr Gazi did not deny that the
“combination” (whatever that means and however it was purportedly
effected) of the two
unit trusts had occurred. [21] Accordingly, U&D is
entitled to recover its 8.7 per cent share of the misappropriation. As
Mr Gazi is liable as having knowingly assisted the breach of trust,
in effect being the directing mind and in control of Meadow Heights.
next head of relief sought by U&D was equitable compensation “in
respect of the $255,801 paid by [Meadow Heights] to
Mirage in the period
2019-2021.” This appears to be a reference to the total of figures of
income distribution for financial
year 2019 of $91,673, 2020 of $59,088, and
2021, $105,040. These distributions are alleged in paragraph 26 of the
Statement of Claim
(CB 24-25, paragraph 26) to which the table from which I have
quoted is subjoined. It is admitted in these defendants’ defence.
Prior to trial, the plaintiff through its counsel was pressing for further
discovery of bank records; in particular the records
which would enable a
tracking to be made of these distributions. I ordered that the defendants put
on an affidavit explaining these
apparent response to my order, Mr Gazi made a statutory declaration in substance
denying receipt of any of the income distributions
referred to in the table
subjoined to paragraph 26 of the Statement of Claim. (T10, L26 – T11, L7)
In evidence, Mr Gazi said
under cross-examination that whilst he had paid tax on
these receipts, he did not get a cent. (T193, L11-14) If we assume this denial
also covers income said to have been distributed to Mirage, it remains
implausible, first because of the initial admission, and secondly
Gazi’s suggestion that his moneys were spent on shopping centre expenses
makes no accounting or tax policy sense.
Shopping centre expenses would be a
deduction from assessable income for a unit trust shopping centre landlord, both
in accordance
with taxation and accounting principle. The profit allocated to
unit holders would be struck only after the deduction of these expenses.
unit trustee and its unit holders allocated income under the unit trust to a
unit holder before paying for repairs and other
expenses, the unit holder would
be overtaxed. I reject the suggestion that this unit trust with the benefit of
advice from a tax
agent would have conducted its affairs in that way. (T193,
L18-26) In any event, payments evidenced only by book entries are never
less treated as true payments.
Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty
(2004) CLR 471. Accordingly, I proceed on the basis that Mirage did
receive the distributions as alleged. For the reasons already
explained, it was
a breach of trust on the part of Meadow Heights to treat Mirage as having fully
paid units entitled to income distributions
on the same footing as those who had
actually subscribed cash for their units. Mirage subscribed no cash.
Accordingly, Meadow Heights
is responsible to make equitable compensation for
U&D’s 8.7 per cent share of the $255,801 paid by it to Mirage in the
period 2019 to 2021, and Mr Gazi is likewise responsible to give that
compensation as having been knowingly concerned in the breach.
now turn to U&D’s claim against Mrs Sener. I turn first to the
$200,000 payment made by Mr Gazi to her following his
receipt of the
distribution upon the sale of the shopping centre ([49]-[50]), which was
described as a “dowry”. I need
not stay to consider whether a
payment made by way of a genuine dowry would be regarded as other than a
voluntary transfer. As previously
noted, Mr and Mrs Sener had been married for
over 30 years. Describing the $200,000 payment as a “dowry” was a
relief sought is “a declaration that the $200,000 given by Gazi to Saliha
[his wife] on 15 February 2022 is held on constructive
trust for the plaintiff
in such proportion as this Court may declare.” This relief would be
appropriate only if the $200,000
continued to exist as an identifiable fund,
either in a single account or as a part of a mixed account, or could otherwise
into a piece of property, in which case that property would be the
subject of the declared constructive trust. Mrs Sener said that
distributions had been used to finance the conduct and settlement of the Supreme
Court proceeding. (T281, L28-31) I did
not understand her evidence to this
effect to have been challenged. In any event, it seems to me to have an
intrinsic plausibility.
Since on this basis there is no $200,000 fund which
could be the subject of a declared constructive trust, this relief must be
Additionally,
as against Mrs Sener, the plaintiff sought declarations that what was described
as the Greenvale property and a property
at 2 Dargie Court, Dallas, should be
declared to be held on constructive trust for U&D; alternatively, subject to
an equitable
charge. The “Greenvale property” is Mr and Mrs
Sener’s matrimonial home, Mr Gazi’s share of which was gifted
Sener by transfer dated 22 February 2022. ([50] above) As regards this claim
for relief, little is said relative to it in
either the opening or closing
submissions made by Mr Sharify. Paragraphs 50-52 of his Opening Submissions are
headed “Tracing
and Knowing Receipt against Gazi Family Parties”.
“The tracing component of the claim is relatively
uncontroversial. The Gazi Family Parties have each admitted having received
trust funds from Gazi, and authority clearly states that trust property can be
traced into a volunteer’s hands.” (Paragraph
50, Closing
Submissions)
added at paragraph 52:
“Knowing receipt is also pleaded
against the Gazi Family Parties ...”
63 of the Statement of Claim states,

tenor of Mrs Sener’s evidence was that she was her husband’s partner
in all his business dealings. As noted, she
“chipped in” from time
to time during his evidence without objection from plaintiff’s counsel,
supplementing his
recollections. For the purposes of the
Barnes v Addy
causes of action, Mrs Sener must be regarded as “knowing” in
the relevant sense, independently of the specific evidence
given at trial. The
very relationship of husband and wife can be the basis for a finding of
“knowing” receipt or assistance:
GP Building Holdings Pty Ltd v
[2022] VSCA 210.
Any moneys, for instance, from the
“dowry” payment in 2022 would presumably have been used to pay down
the mortgage.
The transfer instrument was lodged by Westpac Banking
Corporation. I have already referred to the reasoning and authorities which
deny any ability to trace through an overdrawn bank account. The evidence might
justify an order seeking to avoid the transfer of
Mr Gazi’s share to his
wife as being made to defraud creditors:

to Mr Gazi, 2 Dargie Court, Dallas, is “a commercial property”.
(T174) He described this property as his shop.
(T174, L4-7) Mr Gazi said that
at the time these properties were being used as guarantee security for National
Australia Bank’s
loan to Meadow Heights, “2 Dargie was paid
for”. (T174, L27) Mr Sharify took Mr Gazi to the National Australia
credit proposal (CB 1018), which showed this property as having a
$315,000 mortgage liability as at the date of the credit proposal,
February 2010.
again there is a lack of distinct evidence which would permit tracing of the
trust funds into these properties, and the further
problem that, assuming that
funds were otherwise traceable, they would have been “annihilated”
by having been paid into
an overdrawn mortgage account.
was a request for a similar declaration with respect to the property at
16 Dargie Court, Dallas. The same considerations would
appear to attend
this property, and no declaration ought to be made.
was also an application for a declaration with respect to what was described as
the “Port Melbourne” property.
This, according to Mrs Sener, was a
property recently sold by the eighth defendant, Gazsal Investments Pty Ltd.
(T258, L29 –
T259, L1) She said as to the fate of the proceeds of sale,
“We paid back the mortgage”. (T259, L18-19) She continued,
“Because of the old lawsuit we refinanced everything ...”.
, L23-24) She said there was another proceeding arising out of the
same issues as the present, in which Mr Recep Tercan was a plaintiff.
, L27-30) She said the proceeds of sale were paid into Mr
Tercan’s solicitor’s trust account. (T160, L1-8) She said
funds should still be in the account, and amounted to approximately $200,000.
69 of the Statement of Claim asserts:
“In the period January

received from the Trust

particulars will be provided following discovery and the return of

Gazi said that on 27 January 2022, some $1,110,236.59, being a distribution to
him from Meadow Heights, was transferred to the
mortgage account of the Port
Melbourne property situated at 905 Dow Street, Port Melbourne. He said this was
done to pay off the
mortgage. (T233, L3-20)
attempt to trace is neatly established by the funds transfer, but it encounters
the difficulty that the money was paid into an
overdrawn account, which, as
already noted, is not an asset. Moreover, the Port Melbourne property is no
longer owned by the eighth
defendant. Without suggesting that any declaration
of trust with respect to the $200,000 fund held by Mr Recep Tercan’s
should be made - no amendment to the prayer for relief was sought
referring to such relief. In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate
pointless to make any declarations relative to a property which has already been

made as against the residences of Mr Gazi’s son
and daughter.
next heads of relief sought were as against Mr Gazi and the third defendant, Mr

Company to Mirage for the period 2011-2018.

respect of the $4,495,530 and interest accrued, borrowed

the claim against Mr Muhsin Tercan has been settled, there is no question of any
relief relative to these paragraphs being given
against him or his property.
Focusing upon the claims as regards Mr Gazi, presumably – though the
prayer does not make it
clear – the contention is that Mr Gazi is liable
with respect to the equitable compensation claim as being a knowing assistor.
have already explained why I adopt that view. As regards the $4,495,530
referred to in paragraph L, the case is even stronger,
because the breach of
trust there entailed was the loading upon the trustee of Mr Gazi’s debt
raised to pay out Mr Muhsin Tercan
and therefore upon the unit holders,
including U&D. Compensation as at the appropriate percentage of 8.7 per
cent should be
awarded to U&D.
of relief M and N, which are said to be alternatives to paragraph L, state as
“M. In proportion to the
Plaintiff’s unit holdings, an account of profits in respect of the
$4,382,203 comprising of the
$3,340,000 which was paid by SLE Finance to Muhsin
in August 2018 and the $1,042,203 paid by the Trustee Company to Muhsin for the
period 2011-2018, or in the alternative, a constructive trust or equitable
charge over any asset into which the $4,382,203 may be
proportion to the Plaintiff’s unit holdings, equitable compensation
against Gazi in respect of the $1,155,530 which together
with the $3,340,000
paid to Muhsin total the $4,495,530 Westpac Loan which was paid to SLE Finance
by the Trustee Company in October
2019.” (CB 40)
the relief under paragraph L is granted, there would be no occasion to resort to
this alternative.
Alternatively
to the claims based
Barnes v Addy
with which we have been dealing, Mr
Sharify on behalf of U&D mounted an alternative claim based upon the
proposition that Mr
Gazi and Mr Muhsin were to be regarded as promoters,
and liable as such. He dealt with these matters in paragraphs 36 to 41 of his
Opening Submissions, placing primary reliance upon a decision of Finkelstein J
Fitzwood Pty Ltd v Unique Goal Pty Ltd (in liq)
[2001] FCA 1628
he said his Honour “found that a director of the trustee company to a unit
trust, Mr Drapac, was a promoter ‘of
the scheme constituted by the Unit
Trust.’ ” He relied in particular upon paragraphs [30]-[33] of
his Honour’s
judgment. The issue before his Honour was one of disclosure.
Mr Sharify said (Opening Submissions, paragraph 40) that:
there can be no question that the issue of the Disputed Unit Holdings and/or the
intention to make the Payments was a matter
which should have been disclosed by
Gazi and Muhsin as it is clearly information which ‘would influence a
prospective participant
in the venture to decide whether or not to become an
actual participant’.”
said consequently (
, paragraph 42):
“Muhsin and
Gazi’s failure to disclose puts them in breach of the no-conflict and no
profit rules and they are liable
to the usual suite of equitable
regards Mr Gazi, I am broadly in agreement with these propositions. Given that
I have found liability based on
Barnes v Addy
, it is unnecessary for me
to say more as to these matters. The same considerations which I have discussed
relative to the “suite”
of equitable remedies sought would appear to
arise with respect to the alternative basis of liability.
final matter which needs to be considered is the basis of the settlement with Mr
Muhsin Tercan. When initially announced, the
terms were undisclosed.
Mr Sharify stated in the course of his closing submissions that the
settlement with Mr Muhsin Tercan was
on the basis of a payment from him of
$65,000 in full and final settlement of all claims. Needless to say, U&D
may not recover
more than 100 per cent of its loss. In one way or another, this
$65,000 may need to be brought to account to avoid double compensation.
the trial, Mr Gazi said on a number of occasions that, at least until the sale
of the shopping centre, neither the unit holders
who were plaintiff in the
Supreme Court nor the present plaintiff U&D, made any complaint as to the
establishment or management
of the unit trust. Implicitly, he suggested that
the complaints now made were late and unjustified. The lateness of the
