COUNSEL: N/A
SOLICITORS: N/A
[1] The applicant Brian Neil Hennessy (the miner) seeks the renewal of Mining
Lease 60359 in the Quilpie Mining District. The application
for grant for a
term of 5 years was lodged at the office of the Mining Registrar Quilpie on 23
March 2004.
[2] The proposed lease is located on Lot 439 on Plan PH2146, Parish of Beallah,
County of Kyabra, being part of Keeroongooloo Station.
There are no details
provided in respect of access but it appears access is through the same
property. The lease is over an area
of 2.8237 hectares and is granted for the
purpose of mining for opal. As of the commencement of the proposed renewal,
this property
was owned by Colonial Agricultural Company Ltd. In August 2006,
this property, along with others, was acquired by Georgina Pastoral
Company Ltd.
Section 279
Mineral Resources Act 1989
(“the Act”)
provides that a mining lease shall not be granted or renewed unless an agreement
in relation to compensation
has been filed at the office of the Registrar, or in
the absence of such an agreement, a determination of compensation has been made
by the Tribunal. In this instance, no agreement has been lodged with the
Registrar and the matter has been referred to the Tribunal
for determination.
This determination has the same characters as the determination in respect of
Mining Lease 60358 and similar
findings must follow as a matter of course, there
being no substantial change in circumstances relative to this matter.
[4] The matters which must be considered by the Tribunal are set forth in
section 281(3)
of the Act. Although
section 281
the matters to be
considered, it does not define any method of assessment. Whilst the Tribunal is
only bound by its own
legislation,
the following past appeal cases offer some
guidance as to the methodology that might be used in arriving at a determination
of compensation.
Smith v Cameron
(1986) 11 QLCR 64
, the Land Court
held at p.74...
“The section in my opinion merely identifies matters which shall be
taken into consideration in making the assessment. It does
not prescribe a
method of valuation. No doubt each case will depend on its own facts and
circumstances but it seems to me that
either method is open to the
Shaw v Heritage Holdings Pty Ltd
(1992) 14 QLCR 139
, the Court at
p.146 said:
“the method of assessment remains a matter which will be governed by
the facts and circumstances of each case in which event
emphasis may shift from
one method to another.”
[6] In considering
Mitchell v Oakhill and Mitchell
(10 March 1998)
unreported, the President of the Land Court, referring to
section 281(3)
“the latter section does not prescribe a method of assessment. In my
view, as long as the amount of compensation finally determined
sufficiently
accounts for each of the matters referred to in the sub-section, it is not
necessary to quantify an amount in respect
of each of the matters referred
The evidence
[7] Neither party sought to appear before the Tribunal and this matter has been
dealt with on the papers. The landowner referred
to the determination in
Xalco Pty Ltd & Colonial Agricultural Company Ltd
[2005] QLRT 94
see submission 25 May 2007), but has determined their own regime of fees that
should apply on properties controlled by them. Some
documentation in relation to
factual matters was provided by the Mining Registrar. Where necessary, I have
referred to these documents
for the purpose of accuracy. It is not the function
of the Tribunal to conduct a hunt for evidence on behalf of either party.
the matter has been dealt with on the documents filed which include
the application for renewal, the landowner’s submission,
and the public
lease report issued by the Mining Registrar.
[8] There was no formal valuation evidence to consider therefore the Court does
not have that assistance in arriving at a determination.
Due to the small area
involved, the cost of a valuation would far outweigh any award for compensation.
Due to the small area involved,
co-use or co-occupation would not be feasible,
and the land owner has notionally lost the use of the lease area for the term of
[9] In my view of the position advanced by the landowner is appropriate and I
agree generally with that submission.
[10] In summary, there was no evidence called to support any claim under any
other head of compensation, apart from the submission
of the landowner, nor was
any matter raised which would necessitate consideration under paragraphs (a),
(c), (d), or (e) of
section 281
of the Act.
[11] There are no details of access and therefore no determination can be made
in respect of access.
[12] In making this determination I take into account that the land in this area
is generally classed as capable of low intensity
grazing, provided weather
conditions are fair and pasture in available.
[13] Having regard to all the circumstances, I consider that the following award
will satisfy the requirements of
section 281
the term of the renewed lease
for the limited purposes authorised by the renewal of the lease. Drawing on the
limited evidence
is available, I determine compensation under
Act, to satisfy all heads of compensation set forth in
subsection 3
of the Act shall be the sum of $15.00 per hectare for 2.8237 hectares per
annum for the term of the lease namely 5 years.
the sum of $50.00 as an
administrative/accounting fee for the reasons advanced in
referred to in the submission of 25 May
200). Total of this award is
$261.78. I further award the sum of $26.17 under
section 281(4)
(e) (i.e.10%)
to reflect the compulsory
nature of the action taken under this part. This
equates to a total award of $287.97. I
round off compensation due and payable
to the sum of $300.00
Terms of payment
[14] In relation to the terms, conditions and times when payments should be
made, I take into account the quantum of the order, the
size of the lease and
the term of the lease. In these circumstances, I order that the miner pay total
compensation to the current
landowner Georgina Pastoral Company Ltd in the sum
of $300.00 within a period of (3) months from notification of grant of the
lease by the Mining Registrar.
[15] The claim by the landowner for GST is disallowed. The award under
s.281(4)(e)
is “as of right” under the legislation,
was not intended
to and does not operate as a real or de facto GST levy. The
landowner asserts that the company is registered
for GST and states that no
exemption exists. It would be necessary to
examine this advice. The landowner
does not lease land for
mining purposes. The State of Queensland leases land
for mining purposes
as the Crown i.e. the State retains ownership of all
Queensland stamp duty is not levied on compensation agreements, and
the Tribunal has no instance of GST levies being levied on other
compensation
awards under the
Mineral Resources Act
or acquisition of land under the
Acquisition of Land Act.
