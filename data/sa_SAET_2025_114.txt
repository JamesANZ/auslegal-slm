REPRESENTATION:
Applicant: No
Respondent: No Attendance
within proceedings concern underpayment of wages claims by Daniel Langguth
and Kshitij Mall. Both allege that they are owed amounts
for unpaid wages,
penalty rates and overtime in connection with their employment with Just Gluten
Free Italian Style Pty Ltd (Just
Gluten Free). At all relevant times the
director of Just Gluten Free was Sabine De Vuono.
Gluten Free has since been placed into liquidation. When this matter was last
before this Court, I allowed Mr Langguth and Mr
Mall to amend their applications
to add Ms De Vuono as a respondent. I did so because based upon their
submissions there was a possibility
that action might lay against Ms De Vuono.
Mr Langguth and Mr Mall alleged that they were not paid in accordance with the
applied to their employment.
Fair Work Act
(the FW Act) provides that a person must not contravene a modern award
and that it is a civil penalty provision. Section 550(1) of
the FW Act extends
the reach of the power to award a civil penalty to include persons involved in
the contravention. The concept
of “involved” in is defined by s
550(2) of the FW Act as follows:
A person is involved in a contravention of a civil remedy provision
if, and only if, the person:
(a) has aided, abetted, counselled or procured the contravention; or
(b) has induced the contravention, whether by threats or promises or otherwise;
(c) has been in any way, by act or omission, directly or indirectly, knowingly
concerned in or party to the contravention; or
(d) has conspired with others to effect the contravention.
Langguth and Mr Mall indicated that they intended to allege that Ms De
Vuono met this definition.
proceedings were adjourned until today to enable Mr Langguth and Mr Mall to
to explore obtaining
evidence in support of their allegation that Ms De Vuono was a person involved
in a contravention of a civil
remedy provision.
letter dated 10 October 2025, Ms De Vuono advised the Court that she would not
be attending today’s hearing; that she is
currently residing in Italy
caring for her ailing mother; that she is being treated for anxiety and
depression; that she makes no
admissions in respect of the proceedings before
the Court; and that she has no income or assets in Australia. She asked that the
proceedings against her personally not proceed.
this matter was called on today neither Mr Langguth nor Mr Mall were in
attendance. No explanation as to why they did not attend
was provided.
now, I do not grant Ms De Vuono the relief that she seeks. If Mr Langguth
or Mr Mall wish to be heard in connection with it,
they have the right to be
heard. However, given the liquidation of Just Gluten Free and the fact that Ms
De Vuono is not in Australia,
(which Mr Langguth and Mr Mall are aware of),
there is a reasonable possibility that they no longer intend to pursue the
in this Court. That might explain why neither attended court today.
the circumstances, I adjourn these proceedings to 9.15am on Wednesday 10
December 2025. I intimate that if there is no attendance
on that occasion, I am
minded to dismiss both actions for want of prosecution pursuant to
South Australian Employment Tribunal Act 2014
