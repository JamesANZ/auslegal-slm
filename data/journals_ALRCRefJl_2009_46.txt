In Memoriam: Judge John Goldring (1943–2009)
By David Weisbrot
It is with great sadness that we must report that Judge John
(‘Jack’ to all) Goldring passed away on 6 October 2009, at
after a lengthy battle with cancer.
Jack was one of Australia’s finest lawyers, with a sharp and inquiring
mind, a breadth of knowledge crossing many disciplines,
great wit and
creativity, a commitment to social justice, and a passion for his work that he
readily passed on to generations of
students and colleagues.
Jack burst onto the Australian scene as one of the famous radio ‘Quiz
Kids’ of the 1950s. Jack was educated at North Sydney
Boys High School and
the University of Sydney (from which he graduated with a BA and an LLB), and
then earned an LLM from Columbia
University in 1969 (when that was not such a
common thing for an Australian lawyer), which he attended as an
Australian–American
Educational Foundation Fellow.
Jack’s distinguished academic career was characterised by innovation,
energy and accomplishment, and spanned two countries.
He was present at the
birth of legal education at the University of Papua New Guinea, serving in the
Faculty of Law from 1970–1972.
Many of his students from that era went on
to become major figures in law and government in PNG, and they still speak of
great respect and affection.
Back in Australia in the mid-1970s, he joined and rose through the ranks of
the faculty at the Australian National University. He
was an important supporter
of the community legal services movement at that time, and one of the founders
of its principal academic
The Legal Service Bulletin
In Australia, Jack is probably best known for his periods as Dean and
Professor of Macquarie University Law School from 1981–1987,
and then as
Foundation Dean of Law at the University of Wollongong from 1990–1995.
Jack deserves enormous credit for his successful
efforts in making that new law
school a critical part of the local community and the local profession, as well
as putting it on the
map nationally due to the quality of its academic programs
and its commitment to community service. It is perhaps no surprise, then,
disproportionate number of the legal staff at the Australian Law Reform
Commission were Jack’s students at that time,
benefitting from his
teaching, his scholarly rigour and his incredible willingness to find the time
to mentor promising young lawyers.
Sandwiching his Foundation Deanship at Wollongong, Jack also carved out a
second career as a distinguished law reformer, serving as
a Commissioner of the
ALRC full-time from 21 December 1987 until the end of 1990 (and part-time until
December 1992), and later as
a Commissioner of the New South Wales Law Reform
Commission from 1997–1998.
At the ALRC, building upon his recognised expertise in consumer protection
law, Jack headed up the reference on Product Liability,
carried out in
conjunction with the Victorian Law Reform Commission, and culminating in the
final report
Product Liability
(ALRC 51, 1989). Jack also made important
contributions to a range of other ALRC reports prepared during his time as a
Commissioner,
Grouped Proceedings in
the Federal Court
(ALRC 46, 1988),
Multiculturalism
and the Law
(ALRC 57, 1992),
Choice of Law Rules
(ALRC 58, 1992), and
Personal Property
(ALRC 64, 1993).
In 1998, Jack was appointed a Judge of the District Court of New South
Wales—again, a rare move in Australia and a rare honour
for a career
academic to be appointed to a famously busy trial court. Even more bravely, Jack
sought out and soon excelled at handling
criminal trials, with all their added
pressures and the special need for evidentiary and procedural precision.
When the Australian Academy of Law was founded in 2007, as an attempt to
foster dialogue, cohesion and high standards in the Australian
professions, a group of people were selected to become the Foundation Fellows,
with a premium placed on those with expertise
and experience across a range of
modes of legal practice: as academics, legal practitioners, judges and law
reformers. Not surprisingly,
Jack was chosen as one of those 36 Foundation
Fellows—indeed, he was one of the exemplars. The Academy was an initiative
the ALRC, recommended in the
Managing Justice
report (ALRC 89, 2000),
which also proposed the establishment of the Judicial College of Australia
(JCA). And again, not surprisingly,
Jack became a member of the Council of JCA,
nominated to represent the District and County Court Judges across
Despite this later judicial career, I suspect Jack will be best and most
fondly remembered as an inspiring and innovative teacher
and scholar (and,
critically, a scholar who cared very deeply about teaching) and, throughout, as
a great friend and mentor to so
many of us. All of this activity was informed by
his keen sense of social justice, as manifested in his pioneering socio-legal
and writing on the social cohort of Australian lawyers and law
students—first prepared for the Pearce Committee’s national
of legal education in 1986, and later replicated during his time at
Wollongong—which led to new programs and policies
to support equal
opportunity entry into the profession for Indigenous students and those from
disadvantaged backgrounds, but still
presents unresolved issues.
It is a sign of the high esteem in which Jack was held (as well as the nature
of the modern online world) that the news of Jack’s
passing travelled
quickly around the globe and back, with many people contacting me with
reminiscences. And, so, I feel entrusted
to mention, in no particular order,
‘Jack’s famous pipe’; his warmth; his laconic sense of humour;
his organisation
of cultural tours to India, marrying his love of travel and
interest in other cultures; and the devilish, irrepressible chuckle that
out of him from time to time.
Jack Goldring will be greatly missed. Our warmest wishes and condolences go
to his partner, Sue Kirby.
