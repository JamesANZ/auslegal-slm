Acting Executive Commissioner
REASONS FOR DECISION
On 2 April 2025, the
Commission decided to modify the Derwent Valley draft Local Provisions Schedule
(LPS). The Derwent Valley LPS
(as modified) became effective on 14 May 2025.
As part of its 2 April 2025 decision, the Commission also found that the
draft LPS required substantial modification and accordingly,
section 35KB
of the Act, the Commission directed the planning authority to prepare a draft
amendment to the Derwent Valley LPS and to submit the
draft amendment to the
Commission after the LPS came into effect.
The subject draft amendment, prepared in response to the Commission’s
direction, is the only draft amendment to the Derwent
Valley LPS arising from
the assessment of the draft LPS.
The Derwent Valley planning authority (the planning authority) has publicly
exhibited the draft amendment in accordance with
section 40G
and provided the
Commission with a letter sufficient to meet the
section 40K
requirements.
During assessment of the draft LPS, the planning authority advised that 37
Benjamin Terrace, New Norfolk folios of the Register 54806/23
and 54806/24
(owned by Homes Tasmania) were maintained by the Council as public open space.
The planning authority had therefore
applied the Open Space Zone to the land in
the exhibited version of the draft LPS.
Although no legal agreement to use the land as public open space existed,
recreational use to
continue, but that it reserved the right to use the land for housing in future
if its use for recreational purposes
development but were not intended to be developed by Homes
Tasmania soon. Homes
Tasmania requested the General Residential Zone be applied to reflect this
intent. The land was zoned General
Residential Zone in the
Derwent Valley
Interim Planning Scheme 2015
(the interim planning scheme).
The exhibited version of the draft LPS (and the current version of the zones,
see Figure 1) also proposed to reconfigure the General
Residential and Open
Space zones applied in the interim planning scheme to the adjoining recreation
park at Benjamin Terrace, New
Norfolk folio of the Register 38452/1, the footway
at folio of the Register 37671/501, and Warner Avenue, New Norfolk folio of the
Register 59378/49.
During assessment of the draft LPS, the planning authority noted the
Recreation Play and Public Open Space Strategy, May 2020 by Leisure
(the POS strategy) did not recognise the lots at 37 Benjamin Terrace were owned
by Homes Tasmania rather than the Council.
Consequently, the planning authority advised the POS strategy required
review. Furthermore, the planning authority noted in the draft
LPS Supporting
Report that the New Norfolk Structure Plan - Final Report, Emma Riley and
Associates, September 2016 (the Structure
Plan) was outdated and required review
before its local strategy was able to support any changes to the zones, which
had been proposed.
In response, the planning authority was supportive of the General Residential
Zone and Open Space Zone being applied to the land in
the configuration of the
zones applied in the interim planning scheme. The Commission approved the draft
LPS and directed the planning
authority to prepare subject draft amendment.
