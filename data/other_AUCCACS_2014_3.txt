Appeal Outcome

The Offending Conduct
The offender is a 19 year old Aboriginal man from Walgett. However, he was 18
years old at the time of the offences.[1] The offending
conduct was aggravated
break, enter and steal. The first count of offending conduct occurred at about
12:40am on 11 December 2013
where the offender, together with his cousin, broke
into a local gourmet food takeaway shop by kicking the storage room door. The
offender and his cousin stole a carton of 24 cans of soft drink valued at
At about 1:40am on 11 December 2013, the offender returned to the same shop
with his cousin and two other juveniles. They again broke
into the shop through
the storage room which constituted the second count of aggravated break, enter
and steal. Each of the four
offenders stole a carton of Powerade valued at $40
each.[6] Both offences were carried out whilst the offender was intoxicated. He
began consuming rum in the afternoon of the day of the offences and continued
drinking all day.[32]
The offender made a plea of guilty at the first opportunity and the court
accepted ‘that the offender is remorseful for his
actions.’[38]
The Offender’s Previous Criminal History
At the time of the commission of these offences, the offender was on
conditional liberty, with a number of matters on his record mainly
being dealt
with in the Children’s Court by way of probation or bond.[34] He also has
appeared in the Goondiwindi Local Court
for a matter of similar nature, which
was dealt with by way of no conviction.[60] He was arrested for the aggravated
break, enter
and steal on 5 February 2014 and was held in custody until he was
granted bail on 18 March 2014. During this period the offender
was also in
custody for assault occasioning bodily harm, which was later dismissed. After
failing to appear on 27 September 2014
at Coonamble District Court in respect of
the aggravated break, enter and steal, the offender was placed in custody and
there until 28 November 2014. During this period, the offender also
served a one month sentence for malicious damage which was subsequently
overturned on appeal.[61]
Aboriginal Customary Law issues raised
Not applicable
Aboriginal Cultural Practice or kinship issues raised
In its decision, the Court considered the offender’s ‘strong
attachment to his siblings’ and his intention to reside
with his older
brother in Bathurst. The Court also considered the offender’s motivation
to reside in Bathurst to look after
his younger brother.[31] Subsequently in its
sentence, the Court required the offender to report to the Bathurst office of
Corrections.[65-66]
Sentencing Considerations: Comments relating to the Aboriginal background
of the offender and/or indicators of disadvantage
Evidence was adduced in Court by an Aboriginal Legal Service field officer
based in Walgett. He identified that Walgett has experienced
social deprivation including domestic violence, violence generally, substance
abuse, unemployment and significant levels
of illiteracy, particularly amongst
the young.’[23] The field officer also confirmed the findings of the
Walgett Gamilaroi
Working Community. The Community found further issues facing
Walgett included racism and stereotyping of Aboriginal people, inequality
lack of opportunity, lack of resources and poor living conditions.[22]
This evidence was accepted by the District Court. Her Honour stated that the
community in which the offender had been raised ‘has
experienced an
appalling degree of deprivation over a long period of time’[40] which has
given rise to sense of hopelessness
amongst many community members.[49] Yehia
DCJ considered that the poor conditions experienced by Walgett is
‘necessary contextual
evidence to properly assess the moral culpability of
the offender.’[42]
More specifically, it was considered by Her Honour that the offender had
grown up in a ‘dysfunctional family environment’
experienced first-hand significant alcohol abuse and domestic violence.[52] His
parents separated when he was five or six
years old as a result of domestic
violence.[29] The offender has ‘experienced learning difficulties at
school and is barely
literate.’ He has also had ‘very little by way
of employment.’[31] Her Honour stated that the offender’s
‘history of deprivation and exposure to alcohol abuse, violence and the
lack of opportunity to thrive in such an environment
is intrinsically connected
to his current predicament.’[25]
The Aboriginal Legal Service field officer further gave evidence that there
was a lot more domestic violence in the offender’s
family compared to his
co-offender’s family. However, it was also adduced that the offender was
fortunate in relation to housing
conditions stating that they were ‘not
that bad.’[27]
The Court referred to
Bugmy v The Queen
[2013] HCA 37
, where it was
stated that ‘an Aboriginal offender’s deprived background may
mitigate the sentence.’[44] Her Honour
also made reference to
(1992) 76 A Crim R 58
which recognised the factor of social
disadvantage in sentencing decisions.[45]
The Court was satisfied that
the evidence placed before it had established the deprived background of the
offender.[48] As a result,
it was held that this background reduced the
offender’s moral culpability and moderated the weight to be given to
general deterrence
in sentencing. Therefore a sentence other than imprisonment
was found to be appropriate.[62]
Relevant Passages
To be clear, taking into account the background of severe deprivation, I do
not act upon a kind of racial stereotyping which diminishes
the dignity of
individual offenders by consigning them by reason of their race and place of
residence to a category of persons who
are less capable than others of decent
behaviour. Instead I am applying the fundamental principle of equal justice
requiring as it
does differential treatment of persons according to differences
between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of
the law.[41]
This offender has grown up with alcohol abuse being a normal part of his home
life and also a devastating and entrenched problem in
his peer group and his
community. He committed these offences whilst affected by alcohol. The
offender’s self-induced intoxication
is not normally to be taken into
account as a mitigating factor. However, the evidence before me demonstrates
that he has experienced
a deprived upbringing, including exposure to significant
alcohol abuse and domestic violence resulting in a dysfunctional family
environment and a significant degree of disadvantage. I am satisfied that his
background of deprivation operates to reduce his moral
culpability and thereby
mitigate the sentence.[52]
