Employee Share Acquisition Schemes (PT-114) [2005] VICSROPT 2 (1 April 2005)
Revenue Rulings
Ruling No. PT.114
The purpose of this ruling is to clarify whether a benefit
provided to employees of a company through an employee
share acquisition scheme (`ESAS') is taxable for Pay-roll tax
An ESAS (also known as an Employee Share Scheme) is an
arrangement where employers provide their employees with
an opportunity to acquire an interest in the company.
Under an ESAS an employee acquires shares, or the right to
acquire shares (`rights'), in the company:
a. in respect of, or in relation to their direct or indirect
employment in the company; and
b. at the time of acquisition the consideration for the
acquisition of the shares or rights is less than market
For Income tax purposes, the taxability of this type of benefit,
in the hands of the employee, is determined under Division
Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
Division 13A provides the employee with certain concessions
from income tax, depending upon whether the shares or
rights issued under an ESAS are categorised as either
`qualifying' or `non-qualifying'.
Any shares or rights acquired by an employee under an ESAS
within the meaning of Division 13A of the ITAA are not a
fringe benefit. However, any other share/equity acquisition
scheme that is not governed by Division 13A of the ITAA
may result in Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) being payable by the
Pay-roll Tax Act 1971
') imposes a liability
upon an employer for any wages paid or payable by the
employer. Under
, the definition of
wages includes `fringe benefits' as defined in the Fringe
Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 (`the FBT Act') but does
not include:
a. a tax-exempt body entertainment fringe benefit within the
meaning of the FBT Act.
b. anything that is prescribed by the regulations not to be a
fringe benefit.
The definition of `fringe benefit' in section 136(1) of the FBT
Act specifically excludes benefits acquired by employees and
their associates under an ESAS within the meaning of
Division 13A of the ITAA.
Where the employer provides the employee with a loan to
assist the employee in purchasing the shares and the loan is
at low interest (or no interest) a loan fringe benefit will arise.
In such cases the employer needs to determine the taxable
value of that loan fringe benefit under the FBT Act.
Shares or rights acquired by an employee pursuant to an
ESAS, as defined under Division 13A of the ITAA, are not
subject to Pay-roll tax because they are specifically excluded
from the FBT Act.
However, in those cases where the participation in any other
share/equity acquisition scheme (not governed by Division
13A of the ITAA) triggers a FBT liability, then Pay-roll Tax will
be payable by the employer on the appropriate taxable value
of the fringe benefit as determined under the provisions of
the FBT Act.
