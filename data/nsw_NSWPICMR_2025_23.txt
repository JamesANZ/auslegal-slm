STATEMENT OF REASONS
INTRODUCTION
is a dispute between Graeme Proctor (the claimant) and the insurer about the
amount of the claimant’s pre-accident weekly
earnings (PAWE) for the
purpose of weekly payments of statutory benefits under Division 3.3 of the
Motor Accident Injuries Act 2017
(the MAI Act).
claimant was involved in a motor accident on 15 November 2024.
claimant lodged an application for personal injury benefits on 26 November 2024.
9 April 2025 the insurer determined that the claimant was an earner for the
purpose of the MAI Act but calculated his PAWE as nil.
6 May 2025 the claimant requested an internal review of the insurer’s
decision dated
9 April 2025.
21 May 2025 the insurer issued their internal review decision in which the
insurer varied their PAWE decision by calculating the
claimant’s PAWE
amount as being $596.46.
claimant has requested a merit review of the insurer’s internal review
decision dated
21 May 2025 (the
Application).
his original submissions for this merit review the claimant submitted his PAWE
falls under cl 4(2)(a). The claimant also stated
the insurer agreed with this.
This understanding appears to be based on the insurer’s internal review
decision which stated
cl 4(2)(a) applies. However, the insurer’s
submissions in reply to this merit review now state the insurer’s position
is that the claimant’s PAWE falls under cl 4(2)(a1).
the insurer’s position has changed, as a matter of procedural fairness
interim directions were issued to the parties on 15
July 2025, which
(a) the claimant with an opportunity to clarify which sub-clause in cl 4 he
relies on for calculation of his PAWE and to make further
submissions and/or
provide further documents;
(b) the insurer with an opportunity to provide any further reply, and
(c) the parties with an opportunity to request a preliminary conference if they
considered this should occur as part of conduct of
the merit review.
29 July 2025 the claimant was granted an extension of time, by consent of the
parties, to comply with the directions.
parties have complied with the directions. Neither party requested a preliminary
conference. The matter is therefore determined
SUBMISSIONS
all material times the claimant generated earnings as a self-employed farmer and
from a farming partnership (his business partner
died in September 2024). In his
application for personal injury benefits the claimant stated he earned $1,374
per week before the
accident based on the combined weekly average as a sole
trader and in partnership calculated by his accountant over a three-year
(the 2021, 2022 and 2023 financial years).
requesting the internal review, the claimant submitted that:
(a) taking a weekly average over 12 months does not accurately represent the
nature of a farming business where earnings fluctuate
year to year as a result
of a range of circumstances, including flooding and that his PAWE should
therefore be averaged over a three
to five year period (as his accountant did),
(b) income received from cattle sales in 2025 should be included in calculation
of PAWE as this represents delayed income that would
have been received in 2024
but for the death of his business partner.
is understood from final submissions received from the claimant in this merit
review that the claimant no longer presses his points
at paragraph 13 above,
having accepted the insurer’s position (given in the context of the
internal review process) that the
MAI Act does not permit either of these
things. I agree with the insurer’s position in this regard. For
completeness I will
give brief reasons why when addressing cl 4 below.
submissions received from the claimant in response to the interim directions
state the claimant agrees with the insurer’s
revised position that cl
4(2)(a1) applies (not cl 4(2)(a)). The first 12 months of the two-year
pre-accident period under cl 4(2)(a1)
is 15 November 2022 to 14 November 2023.
The claimant contends for the following methodology to calculate PAWE over this
period under
cl 4(2)(a1):
(a) earnings for the period 15 November 2022 to 30 June 2023 should be
calculated based on average weekly earnings over the financial
year ending 30
(b) income during the 2022/2023 financial year as a sole trader was $99,357;
(c) the loss of $46,387 in that same financial year sustained by the partnership
is for tax purposes only and should be disregarded
for the purpose of PAWE;
(d) average weekly earnings in the 2022/2023 financial year were $1,910.71
($99,357 divided by 52) which equates to earnings received
15 November 2022 to
30 June 2023 in the sum of $61,142.72 ($1,910.71 x 32 weeks);
(e) earnings from 1 July 2023 to 14 November 2023 (20 weeks) should be based on
the weekly average from sole trader income in the
2023/2024 financial year;
(f) sole trader income in the 2023/2024 financial year was $43,103.83 which
equates to a weekly average of $828.90 and equals earnings
of $16,578 from
July 2023 to 14 November 2023 ($828.90 x 20 weeks), and
(g) total earnings in the period 15 November 2022 to 14 November 2023 were
therefore $77,720.72 ($61,142.72 + $16,578) which equates
to PAWE in the amount
of $1,494.62.
claimant submits if his position above is not accepted then in the alternative,
PAWE is as per the insurer’s calculation
of $651.71.
insurer submits the claimant’s PAWE falls under cl 4(2)(a1) on the basis
that in the second year of the two-year pre-accident
period the claimant’s
combined income as a sole trader and from the partnership resulted in a net loss
meaning he did not receive
earnings from any source in the second year of the
two year pre-accident period.
insurer submits the partnership loss must be taken into account, which results
in gross earnings received by the claimant in the
2022/2023 financial year in
the sum of $52,970 giving a weekly average of $1,018.65. Accordingly, in the
period 15 November 2022
30 June 2023 earnings were $32,596.80 ($1,018.65
x 32 weeks).
to the remaining 20 weeks of the relevant 12-month period under cl 4(2)(a1) the
insurer submits the claimant’s weekly average
should be based on his 2024
tax return which declares income (excluding interest) in the sum of $3,359. This
equates to a weekly
average of $64.90 which equals earnings of $1,292 over 20
weeks. The insurer submits the claimant’s gross earnings from 15
2022 to 14 November 2023 were therefore $33,888.80 ($32,596.80 + $1,292.00)
which equates to PAWE in the sum of $651.71.
Legislation
Schedule 1, cl 4 of the MAI Act provides:
‘Pre-accident weekly earnings’,
in relation to an earner who
is injured as a result of a motor accident, means the weekly average of the
gross earnings received by
the earner as an earner during the 12 months
immediately before the day on which the motor accident occurred, unless
subclause (2)
(2) In the following cases,
‘pre-accident weekly
, in relation to an earner who is injured as a result of a
motor accident, means—
(a) if, on the day of the motor accident, the earner was earning continuously,
but had not been earning continuously for at least
12 months--the weekly average
of the gross earnings received by the earner as an earner during the period from
when the earner started
to earn continuously to immediately before the day of
the motor accident,
(a1) if the earner was employed or self-employed during a period or periods
equal to at least 26 weeks during the first year of the
pre-accident period, but
was not obtaining earnings from any source at any other time during the
pre-accident period--the average
weekly gross earnings received by the earner as
an earner during the first year of the pre-accident period,
(b) if subclause (3) applies--the weekly average of
the gross earnings the earner received as an earner, or could reasonably have
been expected to receive, during the 12 months after the change of circumstance
referred to in the subclause occurred,
(c) if the earner is an earner by reason of having entered into an arrangement
with an employer or other person to undertake employment
or to commence business
as a self-employed person--the average weekly gross earnings that the earner
could reasonably have been expected
to earn, but for the injury, in employment
under that arrangement.
‘pre-accident period’
, in relation to a motor
accident, is the period of 2 years immediately preceding the motor accident.
(3) This subclause applies if, during the 12 months immediately before the
day of the motor accident, there was, as a result of any
action taken by the
earner, a significant change in his or her earnings circumstances that resulted
in the earner regularly earning,
or becoming entitled to earn, more on a weekly
basis than he or she was earning before the change occurred.
(4) For the purposes of this clause, an earner earns continuously if he or
she obtains earnings from permanent employment or from
a source that, on the day
of the motor accident, was likely to continue for a period of at least 6 months
to provide earnings to
the earner on the same, or a similar, basis to the basis
on which the earnings were being provided as at that day.”
Consideration
effect of cl 4 is that cl 4(1) applies, unless one of the exceptions in cl 4(2)
original PAWE decision of the insurer was based on cl 4(1). This position was
revised in the internal review which determined
cl 4(2)(a) applied. However, the
insurer has since further revised their position. Neither party contends in this
merit review that
cl 4(1) (or cl 4(2)(a)) applies to the claimant’s
circumstances. Both parties now contend cl 4(2)(a1) applies.
is a difficulty with the methodology of both parties under cl 4(2)(a1). By
taking the weekly average of earnings extending beyond
the first year of the
two-year pre-accident period (that is, to 30 June 2024) both methodologies infer
the claimant continued to
receive earnings from his farming business in the
second year of the two year pre-accident period under cl 4(2)(a1) (that is, on
or after 15 November 2023). The claimant also states in his final submissions
that he continued to receive earnings in the second
year of the two-year
pre-accident period from his farming business, but not from any other source.
cl 4(2)(a1) to apply, however, the claimant must not have obtained earnings from
“any source at any other time during the
pre-accident period...”.
That is to say, he must not have obtained earnings at all, including from his
farming business, at
any time from 15 November 2023 to 14 November 2024.
the claimant’s position that the partnership loss should be disregarded
for the purpose of PAWE were to be accepted, cl 4(1)
would clearly apply because
he continued to receive earnings as a sole trader during the second year of the
two-year pre-accident
insurer’s position that they accept the claimant did not receive earnings
from any source during the second year of the
two-year pre-accident period is
based on calculation of PAWE by PKF Forensic Accountants (PKF) under cl 4(1) in
their report of 19
March 2025. PKF conducted a detailed analysis of various
financial records (not limited to tax returns) and calculated combined gross
earnings as a sole trader and from the partnership received by the claimant in
the 12 months before the day of the accident (that
is, from 15 November 2023 to
14 November 2024) to be a net loss of $21,060.
my mind, there remains a question as to whether cl 4(1) applies having regard to
the ongoing sources of income from sole trading
and the partnership in the
second year of the two-year pre-accident period. There is also a distinction in
the wording in cl 4(2)(a1)
regarding “obtaining” earnings from any
source and earnings actually “received” for the purpose of
calculating
PAWE. Having regard to the ongoing source of earnings and this
distinction in the wording it may be that cl 4(1) applies.
Merit Reviewer, however, my role is to determine the correct and preferable
decision based on the information before me and in
a manner consistent with the
guiding principle in
Personal Injury Commission Act
Act). I do not consider the role of a Merit Reviewer is to conduct an extensive
forensic accounting exercise. The material before
me is insufficient in any
event to determine precisely when the earnings declared in the 2024 tax return
were received (that is,
the extent to which any of it was received on or after
15 November 2023).
is expert forensic accountant opinion by PKF that when the second year of the
two-year pre-accident period is taken as a whole
the claimant’s combined
sole trader and partnership earnings resulted in a net loss. Although the
insurer does not address
whether anything turns on the distinction between
“obtaining” and “received” in cl 4(2)(a1) the insurer
cl 4(2)(a1) applies as a result of this net loss.
there is a statement contrary to the application of cl 4(2)(a1) in the
claimant’s final submissions that he continued
to receive earnings as a
sole trader in the second year of the two-year pre-accident period this is
potentially only if the partnership
loss is disregarded (it is not clear if any
of the earnings of $3,359 in the 2024 tax return, after accounting for the
partnership
loss, were received after 14 November 2023). The claimant otherwise
agrees cl 4(2)(a1) applies.
considered the above, in particular the agreement of the parties that cl
4(2)(a1) applies and s 42 of the PIC Act, I consider
this merit review should
proceed on the basis that the dispute is limited to the question: what is the
claimant’s PAWE amount
under cl 4(2)(a1)? Accordingly, it is not necessary
for me to determine the applicability of cl 4(1).
the claimant previously raised cl 4(2)(a) and also used language found in cl
4(2)(3) (“significant change in earning circumstances”)
initial submissions, for completeness, I will address cl 4(2)(a) and cl 4(2)(b)
4(2)(a) applies where an earner was earning continuously on the day of the
accident but had not been earning continuously for
at least 12 months. The
claimant previously relied on cl 4(2)(a) and submitted this sub-clause allowed
PAWE to be calculated over
any earlier, selected, 12 month period. However, it
is clear the relevant period under cl 4(2)(a) must end on the day before the
of the accident and starts on the date within the 12 months before the accident
on which the earner started to earn continuously.
Clause 4(2)(a) allows for a
shorter period over which to average weekly earnings rather than over the full
12 months, but the period
remains contained within the 12 months before the
accident. Clause 4(2)(a) does not apply to the claimant’s circumstances
even if it did, it does not permit the claimant to select an earlier 12
month period.
4(2)(b) applies where there has been a significant change in earning
circumstances as a result of action taken “by the
claimant” which
results in the claimant regularly earning or becoming entitled to earn
“more” than he had been
earning before the change. The change
referred to in the claimant’s initial submissions was the death of his
business partner.
This is not a change as a result of any action taken by the
claimant. Nor did it result in him earning or becoming entitled to earn
(the financial records show the partnership continued to suffer a loss and the
sole trader business went on to suffer a loss).
Accordingly, cl 4(3) is not
triggered and therefore cl 4(2)(b) does not apply.
for the internal review the claimant contended earnings received after the
accident should be included in PAWE. This appears
to be in the context of the
insurer applying cl 4(1) at the time. In any event, like cl 4(1), cl 4(2)(a1)
concerns only earnings
that were in fact “received” by the claimant
in the relevant pre-accident period. If they were received after that period
after the accident they are excluded from PAWE even if the earnings represent
delayed payment of earnings attributable to personal
exertion carried out before
the accident/within the relevant pre-accident period. The insurer has therefore
correctly excluded these
What is the claimant’s
PAWE under cl 4(2)(a1)?
4(2)(a1) requires PAWE to be calculated over the first year of the two-year
period before the accident. This period is 15 November
2022 to 14 November 2023.
have not received sufficient information from the parties to be in a position to
determine precise earnings received in this period.
As noted above, I do not
consider it the role of a Merit Reviewer to undertake a detailed forensic
accounting exercise in any event.
The nature of some businesses may also mean
that any such calculation is imprecise. In this particular matter, parties agree
received in the period 15 November 2022 to 14 November 2023 should be
based on the weekly average received in the nearest financial
(a) earnings for the first 32 weeks from 15 November 2022 to 30 June 2023 should
be based on the weekly average received in the financial
year ending
(b) earnings for the remaining 20 weeks from 1 July 2023 to 14 November 2023
should be based on the weekly average received in the
financial year ending
30 June 2024.
parties agree, if the partnership loss of $46,387 is excluded, the
claimant’s gross earnings in the financial year ending
30 June 2023 were
$52,970. The dispute is whether the partnership loss should be taken into
account for PAWE. The claimant contends
this loss is for “tax purposes
the claimant had two sources of income – his sole trader business and the
partnership. As such, the claimant’s
gross earnings are the combined
proceeds he ultimately receives as an individual earner from both businesses.
They cannot be uncoupled
for the purpose of PAWE. In the same way the
claimant’s share of any profit of the partnership is included in PAWE (to
claimant’s benefit), the claimant’s share of any partnership
loss must also be factored in (even though circumstances
of a loss would be to
the claimant’s detriment).
documents indicate the claimant was a 50% partner in the partnership meaning he
bore 50% of the business expenses and in turn,
50% of any net loss. Where there
are two sources of income they must be reconciled to determine the ultimate
earnings received by
the claimant as an individual earner. For the period in
question there is a net loss from the partnership (the partnership being
source of earnings for the claimant) which must be accounted for when
calculating PAWE. The claimant’s gross earnings as
an individual in the
financial year ending 30 June 2023 were therefore $52,970, which is a weekly
average of $1,018.65.
earnings received by the claimant from his combined sources of earnings in the
first 32 weeks of the period 15 November 2022
to 14 November 2023 were therefore
$32,596.80 ($1,018.65 x 32 weeks).
to the remaining 20 weeks in this period the claimant says his gross earnings
were $43,103.83 for the financial year ending 30
June 2024. This is the stated
gross income of the sole trader business (after expenses) in the profit and loss
statement provided
by the claimant for the discreet period from 15 November 2023
to 30 June 2024. It does not cover the whole financial year from 1
July 2023 to
30 June 2024. More importantly, the figure pertains to a period which falls
wholly within the second year (not the first
year) of the two-year pre-accident
period. As a stand-alone document this profit and loss statement is irrelevant
to the question
as to what earnings the claimant received in the 12 months
ending 14 November 2023 as all of these earnings are stated in the profit
loss statement as being received after 14 November 2023. If the profit and loss
statement is correct it raises the question as
to whether cl 4(1) applies, as it
shows earnings received in the second year of the two-year pre-accident period.
PAWE were calculated on the profit and loss statements for the sole trader
business and partnership provided by the claimant for
the 12 months before the
accident from
15 November 2023 to 14 November 2024 PAWE would be nil based on
an overall net loss of around $27,000 (taking into account the sole
business loss from 1 July 2024 to
14 November 2024 of $ 36,357.58 and
applying 50% of the net profit of $1,199.12 from the partnership from 15
November 2023 to 30 June
2024 and 50% of the net loss of $55,962.77 of the
partnership from 1 July 2024 to 14 November 2024). In any event, I have
above that the merit review should proceed on the basis the parties
agree cl 4(2)(a1) applies and have not gone on to consider whether
applies. Accordingly, these comments are made by way of observation only.
the profit and loss statement quarantines earnings received on or after 15
November 2023 being after the end of the first year
of the two-year pre-accident
period it has no probative value in connection with cl 4(2)(a1), which concerns
earnings received in
the 12 month period before the period in the profit and
loss statement. It is therefore disregarded.
the circumstances, I consider it appropriate, as the insurer has done, to look
to the 2024 tax return which overlaps with the first
year of the two-year
pre-accident period. After reconciling the partnership loss in the same tax year
and excluding interest (which
is not income from personal exertion and expressly
excluded from the definition of “loss of earnings” in the MAI Act
with the word “earnings” to be given the same meaning throughout the
MAI Act) the claimant’s gross earnings in
the financial year ending 30
June 2024 were $3,359, which gives a weekly average of $64.60.
claimant’s gross earnings in the period from 15 November 2022 to 14
November 2023 were therefore $33,888.80 broken down
as follows:
(a) $32,596.80 from 15 November 2022 to 30 June 2023 (32 weeks), and
(b) $1,292 from 1 July 2023 to 14 November 2023 (20 weeks).
therefore conclude the claimant’s PAWE is $651.71, as calculated by the
insurer in their submissions lodged in this merit
parties seek costs pursuant to s 8.3(4) by seeking an order from the Personal
Injury Commission (Commission) permitting payment
of their costs in
circumstances where such costs are not permitted by the regulations.
8.3(4) provides:
“An Australian legal practitioner is not
entitled to be paid or recover legal costs for any legal services provided to a
to a claim for statutory benefits (whether the claimant or the insurer) in
connection with the claim unless payment of those legal
costs is permitted by
the regulations or the Commission.”
Relevantly,
s 8.3(4) only provides for costs to be permitted by the
“Commission”. As Merit Reviewer, I am not the Commission
therefore do not have jurisdiction to consider whether costs outside costs
permitted by the regulations should be permitted by
the Commission pursuant to s
8.3(4). Accordingly, the matter is referred back to the Commission for
determination of the question
of costs under s
the reasons set out above I conclude the insurer’s revised calculation of
PAWE in the sum of $651.71 is correct. However,
as this is the revised figure in
the insurer’s submissions and the internal review decision that is, the
reviewable decision
the subject of this merit review, differs I determine
(a) the reviewable decision is set aside;
(b) the claimant’s PAWE is $651.71, and
(c) the matter is referred back to the Commission for determination of the
question of costs.
