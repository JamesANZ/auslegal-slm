HEARING : 14

The appeal is dismissed.
REASONS FOR DECISION
These written reasons are provided pursuant to a request by the
appellant dated 14 March 2001. The draft prepared from the tape was
provided to
me on 30 April 2001.
This is an appeal brought by Mr C Miller, the owner
of Lot "..." at "...", Cammeray against the decision of an adjudicator dated 31
October 2000. By that decision the adjudicator dismissed Mr Miller’s
application for an order pursuant to
Section 158
Strata Schemes
Management Act 1996
That Section allows an Adjudicator to make orders
prescribing the making of a by-law on the basis the owners corporation has
unreasonably
refused to make the by-law.
The appeal was lodged with the Tribunal on 13 December 2000. Prior to that Mr
Miller had lodged with the Tribunal on 4 December
2000 notice of intention to
appeal and regard is had to that date in determining whether the appeal has been
lodged in time and I
consider that it has.
The grounds of the appeal were essentially that the adjudicator erred in her
decision based on incorrect information and misinformation
in the submissions
from the respondent. Before me today, Mr Miller has given evidence and provided
probably the best set out submission
I have seen in my years on the Tribunal.
It has clearly shown an appreciation of the issues and a fine attention to
detail and it
has made the conduct of the matter much easier.
Before me were also the submissions that were before the adjudicator and some
other documentation.
The grounds, on which the Board on appeal, can deal with this matter, are set
Section 158
of the Act and effectively what that does is give the
adjudicator or the Board in its place, power to make an order, if it is
that the Owners Corporation has unreasonably refused to make a by-law.
The by-law that was sought was a by-law dealing with work
to be done to the
common property of which Mr Miller already has exclusive use.
The by-law also concerned work to make alterations in respect of part of the
common property which comprises the balcony.
The first issue is whether the Owners Corporation has in fact refused to make a
by-law. There was no real dispute on this point
by the respondent. The
evidence records that a proposal was put to the Owners Corporation at a meeting
on 4 April 2000. The minutes
of that meeting record in fact that that proposal
was withdrawn by the applicant.
The proposal was then the subject of some discussion at a later meeting of the
executive committee on 26 August 2000. I query whether
that motion was properly
before the meeting but in the absence of any dispute about that I accept that it
was, and consider that
there has in effect been a refusal of the proposed
The relevant proposal included a by-law, which was attached to the original
application and a plan identified as plan number three
which was attached to the
original application. That plan involved the enclosing of the balcony for Lot
"..." by incorporation of
sliding windows, the cutting of a door into that
balcony and then building steps up to that balcony and enclosing the area
purportedly
the same as the area of exclusive use to which Lot "..." is already
The reasons put forward in support of the refusal by the Owners Corporation are
set out in the submissions before the adjudicator
and are not repeated by
In looking at the question of reasonableness of the decision of the Owners
Corporation there are many decisions of the Board and
other courts, which say
that "reasonableness" means sound judgment, good sense. This is what the Board
considers in determining
whether the decision of the Owners Corporation was
reasonable. Have sound reasons been given in respect of that refusal.
I consider that the main reasons given for the refusal revolve around questions
of aesthetic issues, not in relation to the particular
impact that the
construction would have on the use of the property. It was essentially that the
enclosing of the balcony and the
creation of the courtyard, a closed in
courtyard and the types of materials proposed would not be in keeping with the
of the building.
There was some interesting discussion and comments raised by Mr Miller, as to
whether the building is art deco in style or not and
it was useful to read those
comments in the submission but I do not believe it is necessary for me to make
any findings as to whether
the building is an example of an architectural style.
The building is an attractive building and it does have some unique features.
do not need to consider whether it is part of an historical architectural
movement. That is not really my role.
The evidence on behalf of the owners corporation was that the refusal was based
on inappropriate materials and the style of the structure.
It was submitted by Mr Miller that use of materials in particular rendered
brick, painted in a similar colour would reflect other
architectural features on
the premises including the front fence and the rear garages. However there were
no constructions of a
similar size attached to the building itself.
The plan also showed that the whole area would not be constructed of rendered
brick but there would also be areas of open grille
of painted aluminium
construction and the plans did show a particular pattern. Mr Miller made
comments at certain points that those
grilles were not of a final design.
However I must consider the plans put before the meeting because the Owners
Corporation decision
on these plans is being challenged.
The Owners Corporation submitted that the type of grilles do not reflect the
features of the building and that the structure would
be imposing in relation to
its size, in contrast to other features and in fact to the symmetry of the
overall building.
It is not difficult to see from the photographs that the creation of the
enclosure is unlike anything already part of the premises
and it would have a
significant effect on the symmetry of the building. In this context the
symmetry does not mean a mirror image
but rather the balance of the features
over the façade.
The other question is its visibility. The structure would be reasonably visible
from several vantage points, definitely within the
premises but from the
streetscape as well and would be in marked contrast to all other features.
These aesthetic considerations
are relevant and I think constitute reasonable
grounds for the refusal of the by-law.
The other reasons relied on were in relation to the closing in of the
balconies. The front of the premises has two balconies, that
belonging to Mr
Miller and the floor above, neither of which are currently enclosed. Again,
they are a feature of the premises and
any contrast between one and the other
would have an significant impact on the appearance of the building.
In addition, the proposal is for the enclosure of the balcony to be done with
sliding windows which on the evidence before me are
not reflected anywhere else
in the building. I do note however, that there is already some variation in
window finishes but sliding
windows are not used anywhere else. I consider that
the refusal based on the choice of a material not reflected in the rest of the
building is one based on reasonable grounds.
So in my view the decision the Owners Corporation made in refusing to make the
by-law was reasonable and it was open to the Adjudicator
to dismiss the
application. Therefore the appeal is dismissed.
The documents that were before the Adjudicator remain part of that file. The
exhibits can be returned after expiry of the appeal
