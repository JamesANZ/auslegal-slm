Justine Arnold v Mail Call Services Pty Limited - re Termination of employment [2009] AIRC 953; (8 December 2009)
AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COMMISSION
Workplace Relations Act 1996
- Application for relief re (Harsh, Unjust or Unreasonable) termination of employment
Ms Justine Arnold
Mail Call Services Pty Limited
(U2009/12968)
SENIOR DEPUTY PRESIDENT CARTWRIGHT
SYDNEY, 8 DECEMBER 2009
Termination of Employment.
Ms Justine Arnold applied for relief in relation to termination of her employment on the ground of
s.643(1)(a)
Workplace Relations Act 1996
The application was lodged 600 days after the employment was terminated on 25 February 2008, or some 579 days outside the statutory
21 time period. The employer objected to variation of the lodgement date and the Commission dealt with the extension of time application
on the papers.
Principles in
Brodie-Hanns v MTV Publishing Ltd
(1995) 67 IR 298
have generally guided the exercise of discretion in such cases.
I accept the employer’s submission that Ms Arnold has not provided an acceptable explanation for the delay which makes it equitable
to vary the required lodgement date, and do so for the reasons set out in the employer’s written submission of November 2009.
The absence of action by Ms Arnold to contest the termination since an initial contact with
“Industrial Relations”
does not support exercise of discretion to vary the time for lodgement.
Prejudice to the employer as set out in its written submission weighs against variation of the time limit.
The merits of the application are a neutral consideration in this case, as is the consideration of fairness as between Ms Arnold and
other persons in like position.
Considering everything before me and the Objects of Division 4 of
of the Act, I decline to vary the statutory time period for lodgement.
The application is dismissed.
