REASONS FOR DECISION
Introduction
30 September 2025 we published our decision in
Grbevska & Grbevski v Zac
[2025] NSWCATAP 243
(the decision), an appeal relating to home
building applications, in which the Tribunal heard cross applications made by
Pty Ltd (the builder) against Paca Grbevska and Robert Grbevski (the
owners) and
. The builder was successful in those proceedings.
The owners were not.
owners then appealed. Their appeal was successful with respect to the
Tribunal’s assessment of damages, relating to their
claim for wasted
payments of bank interest, and related losses, resulting from the
builder’s delay in completing the works.
That issue was remitted to the
Tribunal for rehearing with fresh evidence allowed.
owners have now applied for an order for costs of their successful appeal. In
the decision we wrote, with respect to costs, that:
“106 Regarding costs of the appeal, the parties are
directed to consult the Consumer and Commercial Division Guideline on
note that the parties were not legally represented, which severely restricts the
costs that may be recovered. We will make
orders to be observed if either party
wishes to seek costs.”
made the following orders regarding costs:
(6) If any party wishes to claim costs of the appeal -
(a) Any application for costs is to be filed and served within
14 days of publication of these reasons supported by submissions
(b) Submissions in response to that application not to exceed
1000 words are to be filed within a further 14 days.
(c) Any submissions in reply from the costs applicant (not
exceeding 500 words) are to be filed within a further 7 days.
(d) Bother parties submissions are to address whether the
Tribunal can dispense with a hearing of the costs issues and determine
without a hearing on the papers.
are our reasons for decision with respect to the costs of the appeal only.
knowledge of our decision made on the substantive appeal is assumed in these
reasons. We do not intend to repeat in this decision
matters traversed there.
Additional materials relevant to the costs application
addition to the material filed in the appeal, we received the owners
submissions, dated 13 October 2025, relating to the costs
issue, together with
supporting receipts for out of pocket expenses they said had been paid by them
in order to prosecute their appeal.
submissions have been received from the builder within the time specified by our
Should costs be determined on the papers?
owners requested that the costs issues could be determined on the papers. The
builder has not expressed a view with respect to
whether costs can be decided
without a hearing, despite being given an opportunity to do so.
(2) to (4) of
Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013
NCAT Act) provide:
(2) The Tribunal may make an order dispensing with a hearing if it is satisfied
that the issues for determination can be adequately
determined in the absence of
the parties by considering any written submissions or any other documents or
material lodged with or
provided to the Tribunal.
(3) The Tribunal may not make an order dispensing with a hearing unless the
Tribunal has first:
(a) afforded the parties an opportunity to make submissions about the proposed
(b) taken any such submissions into account.
(4) The Tribunal may determine proceedings in which a hearing is not required
based on the written submissions or any other documents
or material that have
been lodged with or provided to the Tribunal in accordance with the requirements
of this Act, enabling legislation
and the procedural rules.
think that the issue of costs can be readily determined without a hearing on the
materials provided. There are no matters that
we need to hear evidence about. In
those circumstances, we will dispense with a hearing of the costs
The Appeal Panel’s power to award costs
in the Consumer and Commercial Division of the Tribunal are to be determined in
accordance with s 60 of the NCAT Act or
Administrative Tribunal Rules 2014
(NSW) (the NCAT Rules).
60 provides a general rule that operates in the Tribunal to the effect that each
party to proceedings in the Tribunal is to
pay their own costs, unless there are
special circumstances warranting an award of costs. Costs is defined in sub-s
In this section—
costs includes—
(a) the costs of, or incidental to, proceedings in the Tribunal, and
(b) the costs of, or incidental to, the proceedings giving rise to the
application or appeal, as well as the costs of or incidental
to the application
38 makes provision with respect to certain matters in the Consumer and
Commercial Division. It relevantly provides:
(1) This rule applies to proceedings for the exercise of functions of the
Tribunal that are allocated to the Consumer and Commercial
Division of the
(2) Despite section 60 of the Act, the Tribunal may award costs in proceedings
to which this rule applies even in the absence of
special circumstances
warranting such an award if—
(b) the amount claimed or in dispute in the proceedings is more than $30,000.
s 60 applies to internal appeals, but rule 38A(2) creates an exception and
relevantly provides that:
(2) Despite section 60 of the Act, the Appeal Panel for an internal appeal ...
must apply the first instance costs provisions when
deciding whether to award
costs in relation to the internal appeal.
38 and 38A have been interpreted in numerous cases as constituting an exception
they apply, costs orders can be made on the ordinary basis in the absence of
special circumstances justifying a costs order,
as otherwise required by s 60.
Costs orders made on the ordinary basis usually follow the event, i.e. are made
in favour of the successful
making of a costs of is discretionary, but where the usual course is not
followed the reasons for doing so ought to be clearly
the parties are self-represented – as is the case here – they are
restricted in what they can claim as costs. In
our appeal decision we referred
the parties to the CCD
Guideline on Cost,
August 2017,
contains the following advice to parties:
“9. A party can ask for the following costs:
a) The fees charged by their lawyer or professional agent for preparing or
running the case.
b) The ‘disbursements’ of their lawyer or professional agent.
Disbursements are extra ‘out of pocket’ expenses
charged by a lawyer
or professional agent – such as Tribunal filing fees, witness expenses and
photocopying charges.
c) The disbursements’ of a self-represented party or non-professional
agent – such as Tribunal filing fees, witness expenses
and photocopying
10. A party cannot ask for any of the following costs:
a) Their own travelling costs
b) Their own time spent in preparing or running the case, or lost earnings of a
self-represented party or non-professional agent.”
Preston v Commissioner for Fair Trading
[2011] NSWCA 40
, Campbell JA
explained, at [183] that :
“It has been held, ... that a litigant in person who is not a lawyer is
not entitled to receive an order for costs to compensate
him for time spent in
preparing and conducting his case:
Cachia v Hanes
[1994] HCA 14
179 CLR 403.
However a self-represented litigant who is not a lawyer can recover
an indemnity for at least some out-of-pocket expenses actually
and reasonably
incurred: Secretary,
Department of Foreign Affairs v Boswell (No 2)
[1992] FCA 629
(1992) 39 FCR 288
Lawrence v Nikolaidis
[2003] NSWCA
(2003) 57 NSWLR 355
. It appears from
Cachia v Hanes
that those out-of-pocket expenses were ones of the type which would have been
recoverable as disbursements if the Appellant
had been legally represented. Thus
such expenses include filing fees:
Deva v University of Western Sydney
[2008] NSWCA 137
. Though there are some English cases, and some
previous Australian authority (including Boswell ) that say that under the
of out of pocket expenses a litigant in person can get compensation for
the opportunity cost of spending time on his litigation rather
than on other
paying work, since
Cachia v Hanes
those cases have not been followed in
Lawrence v Nikolaidis
The Owners – Strata Plan No 21563 v Rutherford
[2023] NSWCATAP 326
) an Appeal Panel considered whether legal costs incurred by a
self-represented party were costs of, or incidental to, proceedings
67. The term “costs of and incidental to
proceedings” extends to the costs of such preparatory steps as are
be reasonably connected with the proceeding. In
Eestin Nominees Pty Ltd v Rosenberg
(2009) 24 VR
[2009] VSCA 178
Maxwell P and Neave and
Redlich JJA stated:
Supreme Court Act
(Vic), ‘the
costs of and incidental to all matters’ are in the discretion of the
Court, which has full power to determine
‘by whom and to what extent the
costs are to be paid’. As this statutory language suggests, an order for
of the proceeding’ is synonymous with — and has the
same effect as — an order for ‘the costs of and incidental
proceeding’. That has been the conventional understanding, and the
consistent approach of the Taxing Master of this
Court, for many years. When one
party is ordered to pay the other party’s costs of a proceeding, that
liability extends to
the costs of such preparatory steps as are shown to be
reasonably connected with the proceeding. That is so whether or not the words
‘and incidental to’ are included in the order.
Talacko v Talacko
[2009] VSC 446
J held that:
7 The phrase ‘of and incidental to’ is usefully discussed by Sir
Robert Megarry, the Vice Chancellor in
Re Gibson’s Settlement
[1981] Ch 179.
On the one hand the phrase extends the award of
costs to costs incurred in connection with matters in the court. On the other
it requires such costs to be subordinate to or causally linked to such a
8 In the present case on the one hand the phrase extends the costs to those
preparatory to the hearing, on the other hand it limits
costs of the prior
proceeding recoverable to those which were in fact preparatory to the hearing.
Those costs would ordinarily include
the costs of the preparation of evidence
and documentation utilised in the hearing, and in this respect I note that the
hearing proceeded
by way of evidence given in the first instance by way of
Cominos v Di Rico
[2016] NSWCATAP 138

(1988) NSWLR 417 at 426.

reasonably connected with the proceeding”:

The owners’ costs claim
owners are seeking an order that the builder pay their out of pocket expenses
fixed at $1,463.12, calculated as follows:
(a) NCAT Appeal
Application Fee - $506.00;
(b) Audio Recording of Hearing - $50.00;
(c) Transcript Conversion - (Turboscribe.AI) - $31.97;
(d) Legal Advice – NCAT – Proceedings - $326.70; and
(e) Administrative and Photocopying Costs - $548.45.

have reviewed the receipts provided by the owners. Our only issue with them
relates to the claim for legal costs of $326.70. The
invoice provided is dated 8
August 2024. This was before the Tribunal heard the original proceedings on 4
November 2024, and before
it published the decision appealed on 14 February
2024. The notice of appeal against that decision was not filed until 16 May
those circumstances, we do not accept that the legal costs of $326.70 were
incurred with respect to the appeal. It is probable
that the advice they relate
to concerned the proceedings before the Tribunal, which were on foot as at the
date of the invoice. Those
costs are not recoverable as costs of the
the other out of pocket costs claimed by the owners impress as being fair and
reasonable. They total $1,136.42. We think it fair,
cheap and quick to make an
order that the builder pay fixed costs in that amount. This will bring the
matter to an end; without further
costs, time and effort being expended on a
very simple costs issue.
Appeal Panel makes the following orders:
(1) A hearing on the issue of costs of the appeal is dispensed with under
Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act
(2) The respondent is to pay the appellant’s costs of the appeal fixed at
$1,136.42 within 28 days.
