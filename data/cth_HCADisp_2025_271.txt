FITZROY RIVER LIMITED LIABILITY
RICHARD SCOTT TUCKER AS JOINT AND SEVERAL
ADMINISTRATOR YEEDA PASTORAL COMPANY PTY LTD (SUBJECT TO DEED OF COMPANY
ARRANGEMENT) (ACN
094 819 717) & ORS
[2025] HCADisp
applicant requires an extension of time within which to seek special leave to
appeal from the whole of the judgments of the Court
of Appeal of the Supreme
Court of Western Australia (Mitchell and Vaughan JJA, Musikanth J)
which dismissed an appeal from a judgment
of the Supreme Court of Western
Australia (Hill J) and made consequential costs orders.
proposed appeal raises no question of general or public importance and has
insufficient prospects of success to justify a grant
of special leave. It would
therefore be futile to grant the extension of time sought.
leave to appeal is refused with costs.
