REASONS FOR
STRICKLAND, ALDRIDGE & KENT JJ
1 On 21 May 2021 we allowed the appeal in this matter, in part, and amended
one of the orders made by the primary judge so as to take
account of an
obligation to pay capital gains tax (
Taffner & Taffner
[2021] FamCAFC 68
That order was varied on 29 July 2021 (
Taffner & Taffner
[2021] FamCAFC 130).
2 Directions were made for the issue of costs to proceed by way of written
submissions. Each party has filed such submissions and
seeks an order for costs
in his or her favour.
3 Mr Taffner (“the husband”) who was the appellant in the appeal,
seeks costs in the sum of $23,930.38 which are said
to have been quantified at
the scale provided by Sch 3 to the
Family Law Rules 2004
4 Ms Taffner (“the wife”) who was the respondent in the appeal,
seeks her costs in the sum of $2,758.41. Although she
appeared at the appeal and
prepared a Summary of Argument herself, she had the assistance of lawyers at an
early stage of the appeal.
5 Each party to proceedings under the
Family Law Act
(“the Act”) is to bear their own costs unless the court
considers that there are circumstances which justify the making
of a costs order
and (2) of the Act). In considering such a costs order, the court is
to have regard to the matters set out in
of the Act.
6 In their submissions both parties raised for consideration their financial
circumstances, offers to settle that were made and the
parties’ success or
lack thereof in the appeal
(s 117(2A)(a)
, (f) and (g) of the Act
respectively).
Financial Circumstances
7 The husband’s evidence was that his income
is $2,803 per week, with expenses of $2,966 per week. He said that he owns
worth $465,944 with liabilities of $154,353 (the husband’s
Financial Statement filed on 18 May 2021).
8 The wife said that she is receiving $1,369 per week, with expenses of
$1,355 per week. She has property valued at $1,273,400 with
liabilities of
$163,137 (the wife’s Financial Statement filed on 5 July 2021).
9 Each said that their income has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic. The wife has received the JobKeeper allowance
at times. They both
share the care of two teenage boys who attend a private school.
10 The wife has a lower income than the husband but has a greater value of
assets. Looked at in that way, it is difficult to see how
this consideration
points in any particular direction. The financial circumstances of the parties
cannot be seen as a circumstance
which would justify the making of a costs
order, but are such that they would not prevent such an order being made if it
was otherwise
Offers to Settle
11 On 28 August 2020, the lawyers for the husband
sent a lengthy letter to the wife’s lawyer. It asserted that there were a
number of difficulties with the orders and reasons for judgment of the primary
judge and foreshadowed an appeal. One of the issues
identified was the order
that provided for the husband to retain a property situated at H Street, Suburb
J, which, however, would
have to be sold to give effect to the other orders. The
lawyers suggested correctly, that this would in turn cast the burden of the
capital gains tax payable upon the sale entirely onto the husband which was a
circumstance that had not been taken into account by
the primary judge. This was
the ground on which the appeal succeeded.
12 The letter then noted that the wife was proposing to seek an order from
the primary judge that the husband pay her costs of the
primary hearing in the
sum of $43,344.39 (the husband’s written submissions filed on 4 June 2021,
13 This led to the husband making an offer not to appeal against the orders
made by the primary judge (and thereby bearing the entire
burden of the
capital gains tax himself of the order of $139,000) provided:
Neither party
will seek costs against the other arising from the matter;
The wife pay the
arrears of school fees;
The wife sign
the school’s fee-splitting agreement; and
nominate a co-parenting application for communication.
14 The last three points did not arise from either the primary judge’s
orders or the proposed appeal.
15 This letter was followed by extensive correspondence directly between the
parties which did not result in any agreement.
16 Subsequently, the wife made an application for the costs of the hearing
which was dismissed by the primary judge.
17 It is apparent that the wife would have been in a better financial
position if she had accepted the offer because the amount of
the capital gains
tax she now has to pay exceeds the costs that she unsuccessfully sought in
relation to the primary hearing. In
addition, both parties incurred substantial
costs on the appeal.
18 The position, however, is complicated by the proposal which extended
beyond the issue of costs and capital gains tax, and extended
to the liability
to pay outstanding school fees. It appears that they were in excess of $21,000
(the wife’s written submissions
in reply filed on 5 July 2021, p.15).
The inclusion of the school fees in the offer was one of the matters that led to
the difficulties
which ensued between the parties and prevented an agreement
being reached. This, therefore, limits the weight that can be given to
which otherwise would favour the husband’s contention.
Success of the Appeal
19 The fact that an appeal was partly successful is
a relevant consideration
(s 117(2A)(g)
of the Act).
20 That was the case here. The husband raised nine grounds of appeal, only
one of which was successful. The grounds that did not succeed
significant preparation and took up significant time during the hearing of the
appeal. The wife, however, did not concede
the ground that did succeed.
21 This consideration does not assist either party.
22 On balance, we do not consider that the matters
raised by the parties justify a departure from the position that each party
bear his or her own costs. It follows that there will be no order for
