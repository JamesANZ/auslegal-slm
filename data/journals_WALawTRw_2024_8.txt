TEACHING ABOUT CONSENT:
REFLECTIONS FROM AN UNDERGRADUATE LAW UNIT
AMY THOMASSON *
I INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Since the beginning of 2024, it has been mandatory for schools across
Australia to teach consent from pre-primary to Year
This is largely in response to
research showing that consent is not taught consistently or effectively within
schools, as well as
activism calling for sexual consent education (including
from Australian student Chanel Contos, who runs ‘Teach Us
So what happens to the students who did not have the benefit of the change in
curriculum, some of whom are now tertiary students?
While some — myself included — may have thought that
undergraduate university students would be more progressive than
most when it
comes to understanding consent, a recent study in the United Kingdom by the
Crown Prosecution Service and Equally Ours
found that 58% of young people
mistakenly believe consent is assumed in the context of a
relationship.
This is a stark
statistic, and one that reflects not only my experience teaching consent to
undergraduate students, but also to the
importance of teaching those students
— many of whom may be entering their first formative intimate
relationships — what
consent really means. Further, increasing rates of
sexual assault amongst teenagers and young people demonstrate why consent
There is, however, little research on how to teach sexual consent to tertiary
students as part of the formal curriculum (outside
the health context) or the
effectiveness of such teaching. In this article, I reflect on my own experiences
and perceptions of teaching
undergraduate students about consent to sexual
activity in the context of a level-one law unit.
II HOW I TAUGHT ABOUT CONSENT
In semester 1 of 2024, I taught into an undergraduate unit which aims to
teach students about the law that they need, and will use,
in their everyday
lives. While the unit is technically part of a sociolegal studies major in a
Bachelor of Arts degree, many students
take it as a ‘broadening’
This means that the cohort
includes students from a variety of disciplines who may never have taken a
law-related unit (or even a
unit in the Bachelor of Arts) before.
I lectured about affirmative consent as part of the weekly topic titled
‘Consent, Relationships, Family Violence & the Law’.
approached this by first outlining the current legal position in WA in relation
to consent, then explaining the ways in which it
differs from
positive/affirmative consent. In making decisions about how I taught affirmative
consent, I considered the Law Reform
Commission of Western Australia’s
recent report:
Project 113 – Sexual
I thought this was a
good way to demonstrate how legal and social understandings of consent currently
differ, and what might change
if the law were to require affirmative consent to
sexual activity. The content I taught in the lecture was then reinforced in the
associated tutorial, with students asked the following questions:
1. What is positive/affirmative consent?
2. In what way(s) is the concept of positive/affirmative consent different to
the current definition of consent in the
Criminal Code
3. What might change if the
requires positive consent (in terms
of education, social understandings of consent, legal proceedings, what matters
are prosecuted
III PERCEPTIONS OF STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND
UNDERSTANDING
As interaction between the lecturer and students is relatively limited in the
lecture itself (especially as most students in our Law
School choose to listen
to lectures online rather than attend in
my perceptions of how
students engaged with the consent content derive mainly from my tutorial
teaching and exam marking in the unit.
In teaching the relevant tutorial, I found that female students were much
more willing to contribute to the discussion than male students
were. This did
not surprise me given that women — including trans women — and
gender diverse people tend to bear the
weight of changing social constructs that
contribute to sexual violence.
However, it was disappointing that male students were not interested in —
or did not feel able, comfortable, or confident enough
to contribute to —
the conversation.
It is worth
noting that this was not the experience of all tutors teaching in the unit, and
perhaps the response in my tutorials
was shaped by a range of factors (including
my own gender, the gender balance in my classes, and the individual experiences
students themselves). The experience in my tutorials does, however, seem
to reflect the experience of expert stakeholders who have
worked with cisgender
heterosexual men and boys in relationships and sexuality
In a study of 23 such stakeholders, several participants ‘noted hostility,
and a lack of identification with potential concepts
and ideas concerning
men’s behaviours, and gendered and sexual violence, thus leading to
decreased engagement with program
More work needs to be done in identifying ways in which male students, and
indeed all men, can be encouraged to engage in the consent
conversation.
Meanwhile, groups like Teach Us Consent are raising awareness about the
importance of all genders participating in
the consent conversation, eg, by
creating resources that explain how patriarchy also negatively impacts
In addition to the tutorial discussion, there was also a short-answer
question in the unit’s final exam which was closely modelled
tutorial task:
What is the current definition of consent in s 319(2) of the Criminal Code?
Describe two ways in which it is different to the concept
positive/affirmative consent.
The quality and accuracy of answers to this question varied significantly.
Despite my teaching the unit, some students gave concerningly
responses – eg, by stating that consent is to be presumed in intimate
relationships. But many students gave a nuanced
and detailed response indicating
strong engagement with the content. It was hard to tell whether the former
category of student simply
did not listen to the lecture, or whether my lecture
needed to be more specific and make fewer assumptions about the baseline
students had. I think it is also likely, as some have observed, that
affirmative consent does not represent the ‘real life
practices of young
people, with actual consent (such as communication, understandings and social
norms) varying widely’.
Put another way, affirmative consent ‘is not (yet) reflective of many
young people’s practices of sexual negotiation,
where non-verbal cues are
often relied upon
IV REFLECTIONS
In future, I would spend more time explaining what affirmative consent is in
the lecture, rather than leaving the substantive discussion
to the tutorial.
This may empower students who would otherwise be hesitant to contribute due to a
lack of confidence or understanding.
It is important in this context to explain
the ‘why?’ by situating consent in a broader conversation that
students to question social
and ensuring students
understand that consent is not just about following the law but
I would also more actively encourage discussion from male students who may
not feel it is their place to contribute. I might, for
example, show some of the
content created by Teach Us Consent (as discussed in Part
to situate the discussion
in the broader context of challenging gender norms and hetero- and
cis-normativity.
There is a fine
line to tread between specifically targeting inclusion by men without making
them feel like they are the problem
or ‘already in the
Ultimately, the
hesitation to engage may be rooted in ‘social taboos’, which may be
difficult — if not impossible
— to tackle in a two-hour lecture in
which consent is taught as one of many
It may be beyond my
capabilities alone to address the root cause of this lack of engagement, with
some scholars noting the importance
of a whole-society
That said, in
preparation for teaching this unit next year, I will certainly be guided by the
extant research in determining how
I can best do my part to encourage men to
engage in conversations about
V CONCLUSION
My experience teaching affirmative consent reflects broader systemic issues
noted by expert stakeholders.
More research is needed into how men can be encouraged to participate in
conversations about consent, not just at a tertiary level
but across society.
This involves everyone — parents, teachers, lecturers and others involved
in care of young adults —
taking responsibility for consent education.
As law teachers we
are well-placed to provide spaces for that discussion, which inherently involves
the law itself.
