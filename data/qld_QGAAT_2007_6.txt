ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY
The following Enduring Power
of Attorney for HAA is declared invalid pursuant to
Section 113(2)
Powers of Attorney Act
and Section 84(2) of the
Guardianship and
Administration Act 2000
(a) The Enduring Power of Attorney dated 17 March 2006 appointing PA as attorney
for financial, personal and health matters.
REASONS FOR DECISION
HISTORY OF THE APPLICATION
[1] HAA, at the time of the hearing, was an 87 year old lady residing in a
Nursing Home. She has since died on 13 May 2006.
[2] The application for a declaration of her capacity was brought by her friend
MK who was appointed her attorney for financial and
personal/health matters by
an enduring power of attorney dated 11 March 2002. By clause 5 of the document
the power was directed
to begin immediately.
[3] HAA was living alone at home, but suffered a collapse in November 2005.
After suffering another collapse she was admitted to
Hospital suffering from
[4] Following an assessment by the Aged Care Assessment Team on 3 January 2006,
that she required High Care Dementia Specific Residential
Care, she was admitted
to the Nursing Home on 6 January 2006.
[5] On 17 March 2006, she executed an Enduring Power of Attorney document
appointing her nephew PA as attorney for financial and
personal/health matters.
The Issues and the Legislation
[6] The only question for determination by the Tribunal is whether or not HAA
had capacity to make an Enduring Power of Attorney
on the 17 March 2006. The
document, which is handwritten, otherwise appears complete and regular on the
face of it and to comply
with the provisions of the
Powers of Attorney Act
in all other respects.
[7] If valid, the document would revoke an Enduring Power of Attorney made on 11
March 2002 by virtue of
Powers of Attorney Act
[8] In relation to the making of an Enduring Power of Attorney, the
Attorney Act 1998
Principal’s capacity to make an enduring power of
(1) A principal may make an enduring power of attorney only if the
principal understands the nature and effect of the enduring power
Understanding
the nature and effect of the enduring power of attorney includes understanding
the following matters
(a) the principal may, in the power of attorney specify or limit the power
to be given to an attorney and instruct an attorney about
the exercise of the
(b) when the power begins;
(c) once the power for a matter begins, the attorney has power to make, and
will have full control over the matter subject to terms
and information about
exercising the power included in the enduring power of attorney;
(d) the principal may revoke the enduring power of attorney at any time the
principal is capable of making an enduring power of attorney
giving the same
(e) the power the principal has given continues even if the principal becomes
a person who has impaired capacity;
(f) at any time the principal is not capable of revoking the enduring power
of attorney, the principal is unable to effectively oversee
the use of the
[9] As indicated by the use of the term “includes”, it is observed
that these statutory requirements for capacity to
make an Enduring Power of
Attorney are not intended to be exhaustive.
[10] In the leading case on the question of capacity to execute a document, the
High Court in
Gibbons v Wright
(1954) 91CLR 423 had this to say
“The mental capacity required by law in respect of any instrument is
relative to the particular transaction which is being effected
by means of the
instrument, and may be described as the capacity to understand the nature of the
transaction when it is explained.”
[11] Inherent in this concept would seem to be an ability to retain the
explanation, at least for the duration of the decision-making
[12] The Court went on to say –
“The standard requires in
relation to each particular matter or piece of business transacted, that each
party shall have such
soundness of mind as to be capable of understanding the
general nature of what he is doing by his participation. In some instances
may mean the effect of a wider transaction which the instrument is a means of
carrying out.”
[13] In the specific context of considering whether a person is capable of
giving a general power of attorney
Ranclaud v Cabban
(1988) NSW ConvR 55-385
“It needs to be established not only that the donor of the
power understood that she was authorising someone to look after her
affairs, but
also what sort of things the attorney could do without further reference to
[14] On the subject of the cognitive functions involved in this understanding,
Ethics and Law for Health Professions 1998,
Ian Kerridge, Michael Lowe
and John McPhee explain the concept by reference to a range of
“capacities”. These include
the capacity to (1) receive, comprehend,
retain and recall relevant information; (2) integrate information received and
to one’s situation; (3) evaluate benefits and risks in terms of
personal values; (4) select an option and give cogent reasons
for the choice;
(5) communicate one’s choice to others; and (6) persevere with the choice
until the decision is acted upon.
While primarily directed to health issues, the
concept is nevertheless relevant (perhaps even more so) to financial matters
particularly
those involving more complex issues.
[15] It also needs to be remembered that an Enduring Power of Attorney like any
other Power of Attorney is essentially an appointment
of an agent.
[16] It follows that the decision-making process of appointing an attorney
includes, in addition to the statutory requirements, fundamental
considerations
such as understanding
nature and extent of the assets about which the attorney will be making
decisions ( at least in a broad sense);
decisions likely to be made on the principal’s behalf;
the ability of the attorney to carry
out the tasks involved.

The Evidence
[18] In addition to the written material contained on the Tribunal file, all of
the parties attending the hearing in person or by
telephone were given the
opportunity to express their views. These views where specifically relied upon
by the Tribunal, are discussed
DID HAA HAVE
CAPACITY TO MAKE AN ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY ON 17 MARCH 2006?
[19] PA maintained that while HAA may have been unable to make complex decisions
she was able to make simple decisions. Accordingly
she had capacity to make the
Enduring Power of Attorney.
[20] He advised the Tribunal that he completed the form of the Enduring Power of
Attorney and arranged for it to be signed and witnessed.
It was he who took HAA
to the Bank for this purpose.
[21] PA was apprised of the terms of the ACAT assessment made on 3 January 2006.
He questioned the validity of the assessment on
the grounds that it was carried
out soon after HAA’s admission to hospital. He also said that it was
affected by medical complaints
that she was suffering from other than dementia.
[22] He relied on statements made by JR and other members of the Bowls Club.
Those statements declared that HAA is a life member
of the club and known to
members of up to 30 years. She regularly walked to bowls each week on a Monday
night and played a very intelligent
and skilful game. She was always well
dressed, clean and tidy and did her own shopping and was managing her affairs
without assistance.
[23] JR in a separate statement stated that he considered her to be of sound
mind and quite capable of looking after herself. He
said that he could not
understand why she was ‘committed to the old age home’ and feared
that the assessment of her condition
was flawed. She was not well at the time of
the assessment but had recovered.
[24] When questioned by the Tribunal, JR advised that HAA had not been seen at
indoor bowls since Christmas 2005.
[25] He was advised of
terms of the ACAT assessment, the MMSE tests performed on 26 January 2006 and 29
March 2006 showing scores of 14/30 and 151/2
respectively;
the medical report of Dr C of
5 January 2006 that she was suffering from profound dementia and unable to care
for herself at home;
the medical
certificate of Dr B of 20 March 2006 that “she suffers from a mental
condition which on testing shows that she does
not have testamentary capacity.
This has been the case since at least her admission to a secure hostel unit on 6
January 2006”.
[26] JR’s response was that he wasn’t aware of her medical condition
when he provided the statement.
[27] The evidence of JR and the others from the Bowls Club is unsatisfactory. It
may have been that prior to her collapse in December
2005 HAA may have presented
well on a superficial level. Even this seems doubtful in view of a statement by
SD, who had known HAA
socially for about 20 years, about her behaviour at a
function about this time. Clearly, they lacked background about HAA’s
condition such that when confronted with the medical and other evidence JR
became uncertain of his position.
[28] Despite PA’s view, the ACAT assessment found HAA to be suffering from
dementia; her MMSE score was 17 out of 30; she had
short term memory loss;
lacked insight into her health status; sought reassurance constantly and
required prompting with ADLs (Activities
of Daily Living). She also required
supervision with medication, misplaced items and accused neighbours of taking
them. Later MMSE
testing on 26 January 2006 and 29 March 2006 indicated that her
competence had deteriorated.
[29] In a letter dated 20 March 2006 provided to the Tribunal, KH, Senior
Registered Nurse and CACPs Coordinator of nursing home,
advised that HAA came
into the service’s care in June 2004. At that time it was recorded that
she had poor remote and recent
recall, was repetitive and had an MMSE score of
14 out of 30. The major medical diagnosis at that time was cognitive
impairment/deterioration.
At the initial interview on 21 June 1994 (sic), the
record shows that HAA was unable to complete sophisticated sequential tasks (eg
housework) or reliably take medications. She lacked insight into her condition
believing she was functioning well and cognitively
intact. During the
service’s association with her she was found to be forgetful and confused
by anything out of the ordinary
routine. She was discharged out of the
service’s care after an episode of collapse and admission to hospital.
[30] The Health Professional Report by BR Registered Nurse dated 29 March 2006
disclosed that her recall was 0/3 “which means
that she could not remember
who visits or what she ate for breakfast”. She had no understanding of why
she was at the nursing
[31] When provided with the statutory requirements for an Enduring Power of
Attorney BR opined in her Report that she did not have
[32] Dr B in his Medical Certificate of 20 March 2006, has stated that HAA
suffers from a mental condition “which, on testing,
shows that she does
not have testamentary capacity. This has been the case since, at least, her
admission to a secure hostel unit
on 6 January 2006”.
[33] As recognized in
Gibbons v Wright
earlier, the legal requirements
for capacity for a matter vary depending on the nature of the transaction. So it
is therefore that
the test for testamentary capacity is different from the test
for other matters – such as an enduring power of attorney.
[34] Expert medical opinion provided to (and which appears to have been accepted
by) the Court in
Adult Guardian (In Re Enduring Power of Attorney of Vera
Hagger) v Vera Hagger, Declan James Barry and Albert Craig Ray SC Qld No
2001(Unreported),
was that an Enduring Power of Attorney was both more
unfamiliar and more complex (for most members of the community) than a will.
Accordingly, a higher cognitive ability and therefore standard of capacity would
be required for an Enduring Power of Attorney.
[35] The making of an Enduring Power of Attorney, given the considerations to
which the principal is required by law to direct his
or her mind, would not
ordinarily be regarded as a simple decision, as PA appears to believe.
[36] Despite the variation in the legal requirements, Dr B’s opinion has
relevance to the extent that both tests have the common
requirement that the
principal/testator must have an understanding of the nature and extent of their
[37] The witness to the Enduring Power of Attorney, CB, was questioned by the
Tribunal. He gave evidence by telephone that HAA was
brought to his bank by PA,
but he questioned HAA alone. She understood that she would still have control of
financial matters and
health. He did not however conduct any examination about
her knowledge of her finances.
[38] CB gave further evidence that he was not aware of HAA’s medical
diagnosis of dementia, that she had changed address, or
of the existence of the
earlier Enduring Power of Attorney. He informed the Tribunal that had he been
aware of the dementia, something
he would have acted differently. He declined to say what that action might have
[39] While PA has expressed a contrary view, the overwhelming weight of evidence
is that for some period, probably from mid 2004,
HAA’s physical and mental
capability was in decline. She was able to remain in her home with support from
a CACPs service,
but in December she suffered a collapse and was admitted to
hospital. While according to Dr C she appears to have recovered physically
not on any medication, her mental state as indicated in the ACAT assessment and
medical reports was such that she could no longer
live alone even with support.
This is what necessitated her admission to the Nursing Home on 6 January
[40] Clearly, by this time her mental condition as a result of dementia, had
deteriorated to the extent that she was no longer able
to make decisions, other
than on a fairly basic level and suffered from significant memory deficits.
[41] On the evidence, HAA did not have, as at 17 March 2006, a sufficient level
of recall, memory retention or understanding of her
circumstances or of the
decisions that would need to be made by her or by someone on her behalf, so as
to meet the test for capacity
to make an Enduring Power of Attorney.
IS THERE A NEED FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A GUARDIAN OR
ADMINISTRATOR?
[42] While not an issue for determination as a result of the application, the
evidence established that HAA does not understand the
nature and effect of
decisions about personal and financial matters other than simple personal
[43] Since the Tribunal has found that the Enduring Power of Attorney document
dated 17 March 2006 is invalid, the statutory revocation
of the earlier Enduring
Power of Attorney of 11 March 2002 does not apply.
[44] Since HAA has appointed an attorney, MK, for financial and personal/health
matters there is no need for the Tribunal to make
an appointment of a guardian
or administrator.
In this case the power of
attorney in accordance with the
Conveyancing Act
(NSW) contained
enduring provisions for continuation in the event of the donor’s loss of
