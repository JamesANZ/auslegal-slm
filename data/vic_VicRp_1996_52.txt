WESTLEY v AUSTRALIAN RED CROSS SOCIETY
SUPREME COURT OF VICTORIA
8, 13 March 1996
This is an application by the defendant pursuant to the provisions of the
whereby the defendant seeks to have the proceeding transfered to the State of South Australia.
Having considered the matter over the weekend break, I have determined that it is not in the interests of justice that I make the
order sought. I say that for the following reasons:
(1) The writ in the proceeding was filed in the court on 7 July 1995 and an appearance entered on behalf of the defendant on 28 July
1995. Yet the summons -
seeking leave to have the proceeding transfered was not filed until 13 February 1996, that is, some six and a half months later.
During that time:
(a) the proceeding has been entered into the Major Torts List and directions have been given ensuring that interlocutory matters are
attended to with despatch.
(b) the defendant has delivered its defence and has given discovery.
I can see no reason why the proceeding will not be fixed for trial later this year.
(2) By delaying its application to transfer the proceeding, the plaintiff has been deprived of the opportunity to make an application
to the South Australian Supreme Court pursuant to the provisions of s48 of the Limitations of Actions Act 1936 (SA) for an extension
of time to institute the proceeding in that State. Had the defendant made the application within a reasonable time of service of
the writ on it and had the application been granted, the plaintiff would still have been in time to make a s48 application. He has
now been deprived of that opportunity.
In Fielding v Doran
(1984) 60 ALR 342
, in dealing with the weight to be attached to such considerations, Dawson J said at 346:
I am, therefore, able to approach the present application upon the basis that the plaintiff's action would not be barred should it
be remitted to Queensland. Had it been otherwise, I should have been compelled to regard the limitation period in Queensland as a
material circumstance in the exercise of my power to remit the action to that State, for it is hardly to be supposed that the power
of remitter is to be exercised so as to deprive a plaintiff of a right to proceed which would otherwise exist in the diversity jurisdiction
of this court.
In my opinion, to now transfer this proceeding to South Australia may cause the plaintiff significant prejudice.
(3) The defendant's headquarters are in the State of Victoria. The principal act of negligence relied upon by the plaintiff, namely,
the negligent formulation by the defendant of its system for screening blood, is alleged to have been committed in the State of Victoria.
Arguably, therefore, it is the substantive law of this State which will be applied in the proceeding.
(4) It is common knowledge that the plaintiff's solicitors have built up a degree of expertise in litigation of this nature, including
a body of knowledge of discoverable documentation in such proceedings. They have no office in Adelaide. It would be inconvenient
for them, and possibly prejudicial to the plaintiff, to require them to engage agents to prepare and conduct the litigation in the
State of South Australia.
(5) In my opinion, it will cause no great hardship to the defendant's witnesses to require them to travel from Adelaide to Melbourne
for the purposes of giving evidence.
The application will be dismissed, with costs to be taxed and paid by the defendant.
Application dismissed.
Solicitors for the plaintiff: Slater and Gordon.
Solicitors for the defendant: Arthur Robinson and Hedderwicks.
