The Inherent Equitable Jurisdiction and the Plenary Power of the Supreme
Court of New South Wales to Order the Winding Up of Companies.
I INTRODUCTION
Fifteen years have passed since Young J (as he then was) boldly proclaimed
the New South Wales Supreme Court (“the Court”)
was empowered
pursuant to two

all jurisdiction which may be necessary for the
administration of justice in New

issue this paper considers:
the disputed ability of the
winding up of companies not amenable to a winding up order under the
Corporations Act 2001
. This paper proposes an alternative
paradigm by a proposed methodology which may appear counter intuitive at first
blush. It is
argued that the
plenary power
of the Court initially
attracts the jurisdiction in relation to companies not encompassed by the
inherent jurisdiction
of the Court supplies the equitable
remedy of winding up on the just and equitable ground. The significance of this
paper extends
from what may be perceived as a narrow focus on the question of
winding up of companies to the broader and very topical question
of the extent
to which the inherent jurisdiction of the Court in corporations matters has
survived more generally; one example is
the question as to the Court’s
inherent jurisdiction to permit a derivative action on behalf of a company in
liquidation.
It was not until very recently that at least in New South Wales an
authoritative view was expressed as to whether a
action is available regarding a company in
liquidation.
did not disagree that the abolition of the common law
derivative action by the
Corporations Act 2001
did not abolish
the inherent jurisdiction for a derivative action on behalf of a company in
liquidation
this paper’s broader importance is to plumb the depths of the inherent
awareness of the
availability of the plenary power of the Court to possibly assist in areas of
corporations law more generally.

One difficulty with this is (with all due respect) approaching the conclusion by
an irrelevant consideration: should the legislature
have allowed a lacuna in a
code to arise then the legislature should amend the code to remove the lacuna.
In fact this is the basis
of Barrett J’s subsequent criticism of

finding as a conclusion that the statute was not
a code in relation to winding

manner and inviting criticism

These comments of Chief Justice Young were possibly obiter in this particular
case where the subject matter was excusing directors,
as well as dealing with
judicial advice and trusts. However, a reading of the case displays no
detectable criticism from the two
very influential judges toward His
Honour’s comments.
VII CONCLUSIONS
It is submitted this paper displays that Justice Young’s decision in
been too narrowly limited judicially as an ‘authority’ for the
ability of the Court to order a winding up pursuant
to the inherent jurisdiction
only. As yet, neither the Australian High Court nor an intermediate appellate
ruled definitively on the interaction of the
plenary power
of the Court
inherent jurisdiction
of the Court to allow the Court both the
to order companies not covered by the
Corporations
to be wound up.
Regardless of the cogency of the criticism of
there are strong reasons to believe Justice Young’s approach in that case,
as explained further by His Honour in
is the correct approach. This endorsement is respectfully qualified: the
plenary power and inherent jurisdiction should
be utilised and
perhaps not by reference to the plenary power of the Court as the
of the actual remedy but as the jurisdictional trigger. Perhaps Justice
Young’s decision (as he then was) in
have the same effect on the law of company liquidation as Justice
Callinan’s observation on the effect of ingenious and
adventurous counsel
on the common law: “The truth is that the common law has often owed its
development to, and has benefited
from, the adventurousness and ingenuity of

of the court could conceivably be utilised to

of the Court and allow the
of the Court to utilise the
just and equitable ground
consider and make an order if appropriate to wind up a company not captured
within the ambit of the
Corporations
. Such an approach would
accord with established equitable principles and would be a practical approach
to infrequently posed questions.
The broader importance of this paper is that
inherent jurisdiction of the Court
the plenary power of the Court
remain available in corporations matters more generally although the specific
application of those
principles apart from the winding up of companies is beyond
the scope of this paper.
