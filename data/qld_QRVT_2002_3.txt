RETIREMENT VILLAGES TRIBUNAL
[2002] QRVT 3
19 SEPTEMBER 2002
APPLICATION NO:
APPLICANTS:
PHILLIPS MR PHILIP; GRANT MR JOHN; PEARSON MRS SHIRLEY AND VAN DER POEL
RESPONDENT:
EDENLEA RETIREMENT VILLAGE PTY LTD
DATES OF HEARING:
16 AND 17 SEPTEMBER 2002
[2002] QRVT 3
REASON FOR DECISION:
This application has resulted from a
budget process which, for a retirement village, could be considerably improved.
The outcome
of the process has resulted in suspicion and dissatisfaction in the
minds of the applicants. The method of estimating the individual
expenses for
the budget has been assumed by the applicants to be to simply add a CPI increase
to last year’s expenditure.
Now while this may be appropriate for some
expenses the Tribunal considers that it is unlikely to be appropriate for all.
One alternative method is to use zero
based budgeting which means that the scheme operator would start with nil
expenditure and calculate
what amount was required for each expense item for the
budget year.
The purpose of the budget is to estimate,
on the basis of the best evidence available at the time, the amount which will
be required
to be spent in the budget year under each expense heading. The sum
of all of these expenses allows for the calculation of the General
Charge per unit. The General Services Charge includes the sections 106 and 107
items and it should be noted here that section
107 includes the Maintenance
Reserve Fund amount.
When the General Services Charge exceeds
the last year’s General Service Charge by more than the CPI the Scheme
Operator will
be required to show, from a split up of the sections 106 and 107
items, whether the section 107 items have been the cause of this
result. If the
CPI cap imposed by section 106(2) has been exceeded for reasons other than
section 107 items the Scheme Operator
is required by virtue of section 106(2) to
obtain the approval of the residents by special resolution.
Here the applicants were operating under
an incorrect interpretation of what was required by the Act. They considered
that section
106 imposed a CPI cap on section 106 items of expenditure. That is
not the case. Sub-section 106(2) imposes a CPI Cap on the General
Charge and not on its component parts. It is hoped that what has been said here
clarifies what was said previously by the
Tribunal in the
The applicants at the hearing had to
concede that the Scheme Operator had not exceeded the CPI when increasing the
General Services
Charge in any year and, therefore, the first two orders sought
by the applicants must be dismissed. In this regard the tribunal
is referring
to the orders requested at page one of the applicants’ outline of
submissions (a) – (f).
One of the ways in which the tribunal
considers that the budget process could have been improved and could be improved
in the future,
would be if the Village had a budget committee which comprised
representatives from both the Scheme Operator and the residents.
This committee
would draw up the budget for presentation to the residents at the Annual General
Meeting. Resident involvement in
this process would make the methodology
transparent, and would allow the resident members to explain that methodology
and the resulting
General Services Charge to the other residents. If this
budget committee had been in existence in the past, this application may
have been necessary.
The expenses for all items have to be a
realistic estimate of what amount will be expended in the budget year. The
involvement of
both the Scheme Operator and the residents should ensure that
this occurs, and the reasons for each amount in the budget will be
able to be explained. This is more likely to result in each of these amounts
being able to be justified to the residents
at the Annual General Meeting.
Turning then to the contingencies in the
Maintenance Reserve Fund, section 98(1) refers to “expected maintenance
costs”. The Quantity Surveyor in reporting has got to estimate
what are the expected Maintenance and Repair Costs. A contingency
expense can
be included if it is based on an expected expense.
The tribunal could be pedantic and say
that the word “contingency” should not be used but we consider that
as “other expected maintenance and repair costs” or dare
we say it “miscellaneous expected maintenance and repair
might be the result. Either way the tribunal is satisfied that a similar dollar
amount would be reasonable on the basis
of Mr Lukin’s evidence and should
be included in the Maintenance Reserve Fund each year.
The tribunal is satisfied that, if the
amount for contingencies were refunded to residents, a similar amount would need
to be included
either under the heading of Other Expected Maintenance and Repair
Costs or some other heading. The other alternative would be for
each of the
items which have been included to be increased to provide for expected but
irregular expenses. For this reason the tribunal
declines to order that the
Scheme Operator refund the amount of the contingency item as requested by the
applicants.
It is obvious that the tribunal also
declines to rule the contingency item as being invalid.
However, the Quantity Surveyor must be
able to justify any amount referred to as a contingency in terms of section
98(1) as being
an “expected” cost.
The tribunal notes that even if a
contingency item results in an amount being contributed by residents to the
Maintenance Reserve
Fund beyond what is required in any one year that because of
section 97(3), the Scheme Operator must not use an amount standing to
of the fund for a purpose other than as set out in that section. This section
limits payments to maintaining and repairing
the village’s capital items.
This appears to protect the interest of residents and to ensure the contingency
items are not
used to artificially inflate the amount of the Maintenance Reserve
The tribunal is satisfied on the basis
of Mr Lukin’s reports that such an amount is warranted under the
circumstances whatever
it may be called, and that to refund it would only result
in it being required to be repaid by residents in the foreseeable future.
is obviously not desirable.
If the term contingency is to continue
to be used, its purpose needs to be explained further with examples, and they
need to comply
with section 98(1). Specifically in relation to Mr
Phillip’s submission about surpluses, any surplus in a prior year is taken
into account, as one would expect, on the basis of Mr Lukin’s evidence, in
the balance brought forward amount.
The issue of landscaping. Mr Lukin
provided the tribunal with a document which is now Exhibit 1 which explains the
basis upon which
he estimated the expenses he attributed to the Maintenance
Reserve Fund. It also sets out the categories he adopted for the Capital
Replacement Fund and the General Services Charges. The tribunal considers, that
if this document had formed part of his report,
it would have provided useful
information to both the Scheme Operator and to the residents. On the basis upon
which Mr Lukin estimated
expenditure for landscaping in the Maintenance Reserve
Fund the tribunal finds that this amount is a reasonable charge to the fund,
provided that the expenditure from the fund is made for the same reason. For
this reason the tribunal declines to make the orders
sought by the applicants in
relation to landscaping.
In summary the tribunal considers that
if residents are involved in the drawing of the budget as suggested above,
through their representatives
on the budget committee an improved understanding
of the process will result and there will be a greater transparency of the
