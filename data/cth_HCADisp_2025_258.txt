Cagney v D&J Building Contractors Pty Ltd [2025] HCADisp 258 (6 November 2025)
D&J BUILDING CONTRACTORS
[2025] HCADisp 258
applicant seeks special leave to appeal from part of the judgment of the Court
of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Queensland (Mullins
P, Flanagan and
Boddice JJA agreeing) which granted the applicant leave to appeal but
dismissed the appeal from a decision of the
District Court of Queensland
(Horneman-Wren SC DCJ).
proposed appeal does not have sufficient prospects of success to warrant a grant
of special leave and does not raise a question
of law of general importance; it
concerns the application of established principles of issue estoppel, as
discussed in
Kuligowski v Metrobus
[2004] HCA 34
(2004) 220 CLR 363
Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003
leave to appeal is refused with costs.
