Sentencing Snapshot 281: Sentencing Trends for Persistent Sexual Abuse of
a Child under 16 in the Higher Courts of Victoria 2017-18
Introduction
This Sentencing Snapshot describes sentencing
for the offence of
persistent sexual abuse of a child under 16 in the County and Supreme Courts of
Victoria (the higher courts) from
Adjustments made by the
Court of Appeal to sentence or conviction as at December 2022 have been
incorporated into the data in this
Detailed data on persistent sexual abuse of a child under 16 and other
offences is available on
A person who is involved in at least three relevant sexual offences with a
child under the age of 16 over a specific period is guilty
of the offence of
persistent sexual abuse of a child under 16. It is not necessary to prove any of
the acts with the same degree
of specificity as to the date, time, place,
circumstances or occasion as would be required if each act were charged as a
offence. Persistent sexual abuse of a child under 16 is an indictable
offence that carries a maximum penalty of 25 years'
imprisonment.
Persistent sexual abuse of a child under 16 is a category 1 offence if it was
committed on or after 20 March 2017. For this offence,
this classification means
that courts must always impose a custodial
Persistent sexual abuse
of a child under 16 is also a standard sentence offence if it was committed on
or after 1 February 2018.
This means that courts must take into account that a
prison sentence of 10 years represents the middle of the range of objective
seriousness for this offence.
This Snapshot focuses on cases where persistent sexual abuse of a child under
16 was the principal offence, that is, cases where persistent
sexual abuse of a
child under 16 was the offence that received the most severe
Persistent sexual abuse of a child under 16 was the principal offence in 0.6%
of cases sentenced in the higher courts between 2017-18
and 2021-22.
Effect of COVID-19 on sentencing data
The data in this Snapshot is likely to have been
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance:
the number of
people sentenced since March 2020 may be lower than in previous years because
the pandemic caused delays in court proceedings;
court backlogs
may have led to prioritisation of more serious cases and therefore higher
imprisonment rates than in previous years;
prison sentences
may be shorter than in previous years to reflect the combined effect of:
pleas having an 'augmented mitigatory effect' (
Worboyes v The Queen
[2021] VSCA 169)
because they help to relieve the strain on the justice system;
experience of prison being more burdensome due to increased stress on prisoners
and their families and changes in custodial conditions.
People sentenced
From 2017-18 to 2021-22, 48 people were sentenced in
the higher courts for a principal offence of persistent sexual abuse of a child

Non-parole periods
For imprisonment terms of 2 years or more, the court
must impose a non-parole period in most circumstances. If the court fixes a
period, the person must serve that period before becoming eligible
for parole. If the court does not set a non-parole period, the
person must serve
the entirety of their imprisonment term in custody.
All 44 people sentenced to imprisonment for persistent sexual abuse of a
child under 16 were eligible to have a non-parole period
fixed. Of these people,
43 were given a non-parole period
