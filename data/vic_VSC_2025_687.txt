HIS HONOUR:
A. INTRODUCTION
1 This proceeding concerns information
disclosure obligations arising under a Share Sale Agreement (
which the plaintiff (
) sold its 46.25% shareholding in TCN Group Pty
) to the defendant (
2 TCN’s business involves the sale of gift
cards or vouchers that are redeemable at certain retailers throughout
3 Under the SSA, entered into on 11
October 2022, the purchase price predominantly comprised an upfront payment of
$75 million plus
a potential deferred ‘Further Payment’ calculated
by reference to TCN’s 2022 earnings and breakage. Breakage —
money on expired gift cards that TCN retains — is TCN’s major
revenue source.
4 As most of the gift cards sold by
TCN are valid for three years from the date of purchase, the total breakage
amount can only be
calculated with certainty after the end of 2025.
Nevertheless, the starting amount on a gift card and the current total amount on
that card can be quantified at any point in time. It is therefore possible to
estimate at an earlier stage based on amounts already
spent and statistical
models of historical gift card spending patterns the amount of breakage likely
to ultimately result.
5 The SSA established a
multi-stage process for calculating the Further Payment, extending from 2022
through to final determination
by 31 December 2025. At each stage, InComm was
required to provide Indi with calculations ‘together with supporting
information,
calculations and documentation’. The parties could dispute
calculations and, if disagreement persisted, refer the matter to
an independent
accountant for final determination.
6 Indi contends
that InComm has failed to provide the information and documents it is
contractually entitled to receive. It seeks
(a) underlying source data
from TCN’s management systems (
(b) the instructions and specifications
given to Card Compliant LLC (
Card Compliant
), the consultant engaged to
estimate breakage (the
(c) the actual reports prepared by Card
Compliant; and
(d) various supporting documentation
identified by Indi’s expert accountant as necessary to verify
InComm’s calculations.
7 InComm’s position is that it has
fulfilled its disclosure obligations under the SSA. It contends that the phrase
‘supporting
information, calculations and documentation’ does not
extend to Source Data or the Breakage Brief, that it has provided the
Compliant reports (in the form of spreadsheet extracts), and that Indi’s
requests are either unreasonable or made outside
the applicable contractual time
B. BACKGROUND
B.1 The TCN Business
8 Richard Hewitt and Nicholas Sims founded
TCN, trading as The Card Network, in 2019. Its business was the sale of gift
cards redeemable
at certain retailers throughout
described above, gift cards sold by TCN are typically valid for three years from
the date of issue. Upon expiry, any unspent
money on the gift card, or breakage,
is in most cases kept by TCN. Breakage is the major source of revenue for TCN,
with the remainder
being commission paid to TCN upon redemption of a gift card
gift cards can be purchased in physical or digital form, with the amount chosen
by the customer loaded onto the gift card by
TCN. TCN sold gift cards through
various avenues, which it organised internally under several different
‘sales channel’
labels. These channels included a
‘grocery’ channel for gift cards sold through Coles, Woolworths, Big
W and Target,
and a ‘B2B’ channel for gift cards sold to a variety
of corporate clients.
B.2 TCN data and breakage estimates
11 TCNAdmin is TCN’s central
internal management system in which TCN aggregates and records multiple sources
of gift card
information within TCNAdmin includes Source Data, being data from databases of
ledgers of third-party issuers of cards that
has been formatted by TCN. Source
Data includes real time data of the products sold by TCN such as balances and
expiry dates of individual
third-party platform, Power BI, which aggregates data, is also used to estimate
breakage. Extracts from Power BI contain data
from each sales channel from
TCNAdmin, providing information by card and by
has also for many years engaged Card Compliant to estimate breakage. Reports
produced by Card Compliant are based on briefs
and information provided by TCN
to Card Compliant.
B.3 The SSA
15 From 30 May 2018, Indi owned 46.25% of
the shares in TCN. Mr Hewitt is the sole director and secretary of
7 May 2022, InComm and the shareholders in TCN, including Indi, entered into a
non-binding ‘Heads of Agreement’
which summarised the terms of the
acquisition of shares in TCN by InComm. The aggregate purchase price was
specified as $105
a period of negotiation, on 11 October 2022, Indi (and other shareholders) sold
their shareholding in TCN to InComm pursuant
to the SSA. The consideration for
the sale predominantly consisted of a payment of $75 million to be shared
between the sellers,
and the deferred Further

or the Sellers may refer the disagreement to the Independent Accountant to
such unresolved Disputed FP Matters. For the avoidance of doubt, the

paid by the Sellers to the Buyer, together with a
repayment of any interest that
has been paid by the Buyer to the Sellers in respect of the Overpayment, within
10 Business Days of
the date of the IA’s FP Report and, following such
payment, the Purchase Price will be adjusted by the amount of the Overpayment.
The parties agree to each pay the Independent Accountant’s costs and
expenses in accordance with the determination of the Independent
Accountant. In
the absence of such a decision, the Sellers and the Buyer will each pay for half
of the Independent Accountant’s
costs and expenses.

20 Schedule 7 of the SSA specifies in
detail how relevant post-completion calculations are to be prepared.
1 General Principles
(a) The Completion Breakage Amount, Completion Accounts, Completion EBITDA,
December 22 Accounts and December 22 EBITDA (Base) (
Post Completion Accounts
) must be prepared in accordance with, in order of precedence:
(i) the specific accounting principles, policies and procedures set out in Part
2 of this Schedule 7;
(ii) where an item is not covered by the specific accounting principles,
policies and procedures set out in paragraph (a) of Part
1 of this Schedule 7,
in a manner consistent with the accounting principles, policies and procedures
(with consistent classifications,
judgments and estimation techniques) used to
prepare the Accounts for the twelve months ending on the Accounts Date, but
taking into
account that not all line items in the Accounts will be included in
the Post Completion Accounts - Part A; and
(iii) where an item is not covered by the accounting principles, policies and
procedures referred to in paragraphs (i) or (ii) of
Part 1 of this Schedule 7
above, in accordance with the Accounting Standards.
(b) The December 22 Breakage (First Estimate), December 22 Breakage (Second
Estimate), December 22 Breakage (Third Estimate), December
22 Breakage (Final),
Final Breakage Amount, December 22 EBITDA (Second Estimate), December 22 EBITDA
(Third Estimate) and December
22 EBITDA (Final) (
Post Completion Accounts -
, together with the Post Completion Accounts - Part A, the
Completion Accounts
) must be prepared in accordance with the specific
accounting principles, policies and procedures set out in Part 2 of this
2 Accounting Principles
The Post Completion Accounts must be prepared in accordance with the following
principles:
(a) The Completion Accounts and December 22 Accounts must be prepared in a
manner consistent with the accounting standards, principles,
policies and
procedures used to prepare the Completion Statement in accordance with Part B of
Schedule 6, other than the following
normalisations that are to be added back to
the Completion EBITDA and December 22 EBITDA (Base):
(i) Transaction Costs, including but not limited to travel, accommodation and
associated expenses relating to visit by TCN and its
advisers to Tampa in
September 2022; and
(ii) where not already included in Transaction Costs under Paragraph (a)(i) of
Part 2 of Schedule 7, the following
normalisations:
(b) Completion Breakage Amount must be calculated on the same basis that the
Group has accounted for Breakage in the Accounts, being:
(i) Breakage is recognised in line with month of sale. Breakage is not
recognised in line with spend as required under IFRS15. For
example, the Group
sold 1 x $100 card in a month, and the Group expects 10% of the funds on that
card to be unspent at the end of
its expiration period, the Group would take up
$10 of breakage revenue (less GST liability) in the month of sale via a journal
(ii) Historically, Card Compliant reports are used to guide the Group’s
breakage estimates for its 7 highest selling cards.
The Group has adopted its
own models and uses the Card Compliant reports as an index.
(iii) In respect of corporate sales (B2B), the Group recognises Breakage in the
month after sale. Each quarter the Group reviews
its corporate breakage
estimates and post true-ups/true-downs for any material variances from our
initial estimates.
(c) Completion EBITDA must be calculated using the EBITDA derived from the
Completion Accounts, excluding Breakage for Gift Cards
sold in the period
commencing on 1 January 2022 and ending on the Effective Time.
(d) December 22 Breakage (First Estimate), December 22 Breakage (Second
Estimate), December 22 Breakage (Third Estimate), December
22 Breakage (Final)
and Final Breakage Amount based on actual Breakage data to the extent that it is
available and forecast data
for unexpired cards.
(e) December 22 EBITDA (Base) must be calculated using the EBITDA derived from
the December 22 Accounts (and having regard to the
Completion EBITDA, including
the same normalisations as in the Completion EBITDA), excluding December 22
(f) December 22 EBITDA (Second Estimate), December 22 EBITDA (Third Estimate)
and December 22 EBITDA (Final) must all be calculated
using the December 22
EBITDA (Base) adjusted to include the following:
(i) December 22 Breakage (Second Estimate), December 22 Breakage (Third
Estimate) or December 22 Breakage (Final), as appropriate;
(ii) changes to Commissions based on the quantum of the December 22 Breakage
(Second Estimate), December 22 Breakage (Third Estimate)
or December 22 Breakage
(Final), as appropriate.
(g) When calculating each of December 22 EBITDA (Second Estimate), December 22
EBITDA (Third Estimate) and December 22 EBITDA (Final),
the only variables that
will change from the December 22 EBITDA (Base) will be changes in the
calculation of December 22 Breakage
and the corresponding changes to commissions
as a result of such changes to December 22 Breakage.
(h) Breakage and Commission Worked Example
(i) The Breakage estimates have a direct impact on the Commission estimates as
(ii) There are two estimates in the Group accounts posted at month end:
(A) Breakage equalling estimated balance left on Gift Cards at expiration, less
10% GST; and
(B) Commission equalling estimated commission revenue earned on Gift Cards sold
during the period, calculated on specific cards at
a rate agreed to in specific
partner agreements.
(iii) Example: If Breakage is estimated at 20%, then the estimated commission
revenue is calculated on 80% of the Gift Cards. At
the end of the 3-year period,
if Breakage is actually 18%, then 82% of the Gift Cards would have earned
commission revenue at the
rates specific to those particular cards and
(iv) At the end of the Gift Card lifecycle (3 years), both of the above
estimates will become actuals and an adjustment will occur.

clause 7.1(a) was $50,467,676.27, the calculation of the Completion
pursuant to clause 7.1(c) was -$12,949,309.75 and the calculation of the EBITDA
pursuant to clause 7.1(d) was $3,887,011.29,
with a normalised calculation of

subsequently revoked on 11

five spreadsheets ‘in respect of reporting
under clause 7.2’. The
December 22 Breakage (First Estimate) it calculated pursuant to clause 7.2(a)(i)

calculations from Card Compliant

included Card Compliant logos) and further tabs that appeared to summarise
information regarding other channels.

which, in effect, purported to constitute the 2nd FP

to InComm. The email noted that in the material provided by InComm to Indi
pursuant to the
relevant subclauses of clause 7, there were differences in Issue
Amounts — the value of gift cards sold in CY22 — across
the material
where the figure should be static. It sought further information about these
discrepancies.
next day, Indi sent another email to InComm which attached a notice pursuant to
clause 7.16 of the SSA seeking the provision
of information relating to the
discrepancies identified in the 4 March 2025 email. It stated as follows:

Mould to Olivia Parsons of Card Compliant, which attached instruction

he required those documents. The documents Mr Carruth
required were largely the same as those identified in the Carruth Report. The

C. ISSUES IN DISPUTE
56 The particular issues in dispute in
this proceeding may be summarised as follows:
(a) Is Indi entitled to the
Source Data, the Breakage Brief, any communications between InComm and Card
Compliant, and all documents
relied upon to prepare the FP Notices pursuant to
clauses 7.2, 7.4 and 7.11 of the SSA?
(b) Is Indi
entitled to the information, including underlying ledgers and sample invoices,
relating to the calculation of the December
22 EBITDA (Base) pursuant to clause
(c) Has InComm provided the Card Compliant
reports to Indi pursuant to clauses 7.2(a), 7.4(a) and
(d) Is Indi otherwise entitled by clause
7.16(a) to the categories of information requested under clause 7.2, 7.4 or 7.11
do not fit within the terms of those
(e) Is Indi entitled to the documents it
has requested pursuant to clause 7.16(b), which its adviser, Mr Carruth, says he
conduct a review of the
calculations?
(f) Is Indi entitled to current
versions of Power BI exports attached to the email of 31 October 2023 from Mr
Mould to Mr Hewitt?
D. SUBMISSIONS
D.1 Is Indi entitled to Source Data, the Breakage Brief, communications
between InComm and Card Compliant, and documents relied upon
to prepare the FP
Notices, pursuant to clauses 7.2, 7.4 and 7.11?
57 In oral submissions, Indi framed the
dispute as ‘less of a construction issue’ but a question of whether
provided the documents to satisfy the terms of clauses 7.2, 7.4 and
7.11. Senior counsel for Indi noted that Mr Mould conceded in
cross-examination
that the Card Compliant reports were dependent on the Source Data extracted from
TCNAdmin, and that the material
had not been provided to Indi in relation to
both clauses 7.4 and
submitted that the failure to provide the Source Data was especially problematic
in circumstances where there was a discrepancy
of Issue Amounts in the
spreadsheets provided by InComm across the different FP Notices of some $1.5
million. Senior counsel for
Indi referred to the cross-examination of Mr Mould
in which he explained that the discrepancy resulted from
‘kick-outs’,
which were cards not included in the relevant
calculations because of inconsistencies in the data relating to them. However,
observed that in the Card Compliant PDF reports, kick-outs were said to
total some $21,000. These discrepancies raised a number of
questions that
required the underlying Source Data to
submissions relating to the provision of Source Data pursuant to clause 7.2 were
more limited. Senior counsel for
Indi submitted that Indi was still entitled to
the supporting material under that clause, and it was relevant in circumstances
Issue Amounts had been changing over time and therefore would

information as was required by
the terms of clauses 7.2, 7.4 and 7.11. It submitted that the Breakage Brief
ought to include Source
relation to the provision of documents underlying the preparation of the FP
Notices, Indi submitted that this was required pursuant
to clauses 7.4 and 7.11
and that preparation of the FP Notices would have necessitated the
(a) review of the estimated
revenue and breakage for each channel using sales and spend data (broken down by
month) extracted from
TCNAdmin and Power BI;
(b) review of sales and spend data for each channel
(broken down by month) extracted from TCNAdmin and Power BI, including channel
specific data, and for channel ‘B2B’, client specific data;
(c) application of one or more methodologies for
the calculations, which methodology ought be discernible from the underlying
in spreadsheets (i.e. spreadsheets that are not
hard-coded).
62 InComm submitted that on a proper
construction, the words ‘supporting information, calculations and
documentation’
in clauses 7.2, 7.4 and 7.11 do not embrace Source
submitted that clause 7 of the SSA sets out a five-stage process for the
calculation of the Further Payment. The first stage
involves clause 7.1 and its
obligations on the Sellers to provide calculations relevant to Completion. The
second stage involves
the provision of calculations and the review process
provided for under clauses 7.2 and 7.3. The third stage involves the
calculations
and information that InComm must provide under clause 7.4,
including the calculation of the Further Payment pursuant to clause 7.5,
process for review and dispute provided for under clauses 7.6 to 7.10. The
fourth stage is a similar process to the third,
with the calculations and
information to be provided under clause 7.11, and the same clauses 7.5 to 7.10
being applied for the calculation,
review and dispute process. The fifth and
final stage is the Final FP Notice calculation under clause 7.12, which then
flows through
to the Independent Account dispute resolution process under
clauses 7.13 and
noted that the structure of this staged process involves a limited window of
time at the third and fourth stages —
namely, 20 business days for Indi to
review the material provided under clause 7.4 or 7.11 and respond indicating
agreement or non-agreement
and a further 20 business days for the parties to
engage in good-faith discussions to resolve any
non-agreement.
further noted that the parties elected to have Card Compliant provide a
calculation of estimated breakage at the second,
third and fourth stages. InComm
referred to Part 3 of Schedule 7 to the SSA, in which the Breakage Brief was
defined, and pointed
in particular to the phrase ‘acknowledging that Card
Compliant has final determination of its calculations and report’.
submitted that the parties thereby acknowledged that Card Compliant would
finally determine the matters comprising its calculations
and report for the
purposes of clauses 7.2, 7.4 and
these two contextual observations together, InComm submitted that clause 7
establishes an expedient process in which Card
Compliant’s estimates are
provisional but create the possibility of an early Further Payment if the
parties reach agreement
within the limited review windows at the third or fourth
stage. However, InComm characterised stage five as the ‘main game’
— the point at which final breakage numbers would ultimately be
determined. On this construction, Indi had no entitlement to
Source Data because
the limited review windows had elapsed and Card Compliant was to deliver the
relevant calculations over which
it had final
determination.
submitted that although the same obligation to provide ‘information,
calculations and documentation’ was included
in clause 7.1, that was not
to be read in the same way as it ‘has a different
further submitted that its construction of the obligation was supported by the
fact that it would have been simple for the
parties to have included a reference
to Source Data explicitly in clauses 7.2, 7.4 and 7.11 but they did not do
submitted that there were also no relevant communications to Card Compliant in
writing that were not produced. InComm had
provided to Indi on 16 April 2025
copies of relevant instructions it had provided to Card Compliant which were in
the same form as
those that had been provided to InComm in the data room for the
sale of TCN. Senior counsel for InComm referred to the evidence of
Mr Mould in
which he stated the relevant information that had been provided to support this
proposition.
In the alternative,
InComm submitted that there was no contractual obligation to provide such
communications. It would have been
easy for the parties to have explicitly
required the provision of the communications with Card Compliant in the SSA if
submitted that Mr Mould had also provided all other information on which InComm
relied to prepare the FP

any specific information other than Source Data that had not been provided, and

reply to InComm’s submission that the reference to ‘supporting
information, calculations and documentation’
in clauses 7.2, 7.4 and 7.11
did not embrace Source Data, Indi submitted that there was an equivalent
reference in clause 7.12. Clause
7.12 required InComm to prepare the Final
FP Notice itself, and such preparations would necessarily be made on the basis
Data. Indi therefore submitted that if equivalent phrases in the
contract are to have the same meaning, then the references in clauses
and 7.11 must also embrace Source
further submitted in reply that it faced an ‘information asymmetry’
which required provision of Source Data to
rectify. Without this information,
Indi would be disadvantaged in preparing submissions to the Independent
Accountant within the
limited time frames prescribed by the
to the provision of communications between InComm and Card Compliant, Indi
submitted that it was ‘unquestionable that
instructions were provided by
InComm to Card Compliant’. Indi was seeking information relating to the
production of reports
and calculations pursuant to clauses 7.2, 7.4 and 7.11,
which must include such
instructions.
D.2 Is Indi entitled to the information, including underlying ledgers and
sample invoices, relating to the calculation of the December
22 EBITDA (Base)
pursuant to clause 7.2?
74 InComm submitted that the parties had
agreed to the December 22 EBITDA (Base) and ‘nothing in the evidence [was]
a need to have a wholesale audit of the [December 22] EBITDA
submitted that it was not necessary to resolve the question of whether Indi had
agreed to InComm’s calculation of the
December 22 EBITDA (Base), because
Indi’s entitlement to the underlying material was independent of any
agreement about the
figure. Indi’s access to that material remained
relevant insofar as the December 22 EBITDA (Base) was a figure that carried
forward through the Further Payment calculation
referred to Mr Mould’s concession in cross-examination that it would be
necessary to consider the underlying ledgers
and sample invoices to form a view
Indi did not have
access to that information. On that basis, Indi submitted that
those materials fell within clause 7.2 because they are supporting
information
or documentation relevant to the calculation of the December 22 EBITDA
D.3 Has InComm provided the Card Compliant reports?
77 Indi submitted that the Card Compliant
PDF reports did not adequately meet the description of Card Compliant reports
despite the
express obligation in clauses 7.2(a), 7.4(a), and 7.11(a)(i)
requiring their provision. Indi emphasised that InComm had not produced
‘single standalone report that satisfies [the] time period’ of
78 Indi further submitted that the spreadsheets
with tabs, including Card Compliant calculations, did not meet the description
Card Compliant reports. Relying on the cross-examination of Mr
Indi highlighted that the
spreadsheets only included
of Card Compliant reports and were
not the reports
themselves.
submitted that the spreadsheets are the reports it has provided in fulfilment of
its requirement to provide Card Compliant
reports pursuant to clauses 7.2, 7.4,
7.11 (rather than the Card Compliant PDF
submitted that there is no dispute that the purported Card Compliant reports
comprise reports regarding CY22. Rather, the
issue raised by Indi is that these
spreadsheets do not resemble the Card Compliant PDF reports. InComm pointed to
evidence indicating that Card Compliant provided a report
containing CY22 data alongside data from other years, and that the non-CY22
was subsequently removed.
D.4 Is Indi alternatively entitled to the Source Data, Breakage Brief,
Card Compliant reports and communications, and documents relied
upon to prepare
the FP Notices under clause 7.16(a)?
81 Indi’s primary submission was
that reliance on clause 7.16(a) was unnecessary, because the information it
sought was captured
by clauses 7.2, 7.4 and 7.11. Nevertheless, it advanced
clause 7.16(a) as an independent basis upon which it had requested and was
entitled to receive the material it sought under those
accepted that clause 7.16(a) required that the information sought was reasonably
requested and that any information requested
under the clause was for the
purpose of preparing, reviewing or agreeing to the relevant FP Notices. It
submitted that the information
it sought satisfied those requirements because
the FP Notice calculation involves both a calculation of the December 22 EBITDA
as well as a calculation of the breakage amount and the information
sought is information underlying these
calculations.
further submitted that it was not an answer to say that the FP Notice process
had ‘played out’ for clauses 7.4
and 7.11 because the FP Notices
were still the subject of ongoing review, especially because the final
determination of the Further
Payment by the Independent Accountant was due to
take place next year. Indi submitted that the requests for further information
clause 7.16(a) were made in time, and it would be commercially unworkable
for the obligation to provide information to be ineffective
after that time had
submitted that clause 7.16(a) had expired on its proper construction because the
clause is expressly limited to be for the
stipulated purpose of enabling Indi to
review and agree to the FP
submitted that clause 7.6 provides a window of 20 business days after which Indi
would be deemed to have accepted the relevant
FP Notice. This is an expedient
process for seeking to reach agreement, and clause 7.16 is only available during
this period. If
a response by InComm was not provided in that period, despite a
request, then Indi could seek specific performance within the period,
period had elapsed, such a response would be rendered unnecessary because the
process for reviewing and agreeing to the
FP notice is ‘in the rear-view
mirror’ and any ongoing disagreement could be resolved under the
Independent Accountant
submitted in the alternative that the request must also be reasonable. InComm
submitted that a request for Source Data under
this clause was not reasonable

the definition of Breakage Brief described above at
reply to InComm’s submission that Indi’s entitlement to the
information it requested pursuant to clause 7.16 expired
within a limited
period, Indi submitted that InComm’s construction would necessitate Indi
troubling the court ‘at various
points in time through the process in
order ... to get access to information within the set time periods, which are
not expressed
D.5 Is Indi entitled to the material sought by Mr Carruth pursuant to
clause 7.16(b)?
88 Indi submitted that the information
sought by Mr Carruth fell within clause 7.16(b) as ‘information and
assistance that may
be reasonably requested by the advisers of the ... Sellers
in relation to the preparation of, review of, and agreement to, the draft
final (as applicable) FP Notice and Final FP Notice (as
applicable)’.
submitted that InComm had the opportunity to respond to Mr Carruth’s
reports and his requests for documentation. InComm
had failed to do so in
circumstances where it had filed an affidavit of Mr Mould, which did not at any
point take issue with the
categories of documents Mr Carruth had requested. Nor
had Mr Mould suggested that the categories of documents were vague or that
would be onerous to provide the documents. Counsel for Indi noted that Mr Mould,
in cross-examination, accepted that general ledgers
were readily available.
Though a request for invoices and other underlying documents was unspecified as
to their extent, Indi submitted
that its extent would depend on the extent of
the general ledger and how accurate its entries

was to raise any dispute regarding those FP Notices had elapsed, the entitlement

even if that entitlement had not elapsed, InComm submitted that Mr

in the Carruth Report, was
directed to answering the question of whether he had sufficient documents to

each of the components necessary for calculating
the Further Payment’.

would fly in the face of the whole structure
of good faith negotiations provided
submitted that Mr Carruth did not appear to have any expertise in answering
questions relevant to the calculation of breakage
(which is necessary for
calculating the Further Payment). His experience as an accountant is focused on
auditing a set of unaudited
94 InComm submitted that the categories of
documents requested by Mr Carruth were also expressed very generally. Indi was
to demonstrate that categories of this width and in this manner are
permissible under the SSA to be reasonably
counsel for InComm suggested that one category, including general ledger entries
and underlying transaction records ‘might
well comprise every single
business record’. Thus, Mr Carruth’s requested categories were not
reasonable because they
were so vague that there might be disputation about what
is or is not captured. Instead, Mr Carruth should have requested tangible,
discrete documents.
D.6 Is Indi entitled to the Power BI extracts?
96 In relation to the Power BI extracts,
Indi conceded the link between those extracts to ‘supporting’
information within
the relevant subclauses of clause 7 was more difficult, but
submitted that the Power BI extracts were nonetheless material that would

onerous and therefore unreasonable to
submitted that any Card Compliant reports were not based on Power BI extracts,

E. LEGAL PRINCIPLES
98 The legal principles relevant to the
construction of a commercial contract are well established and are not in
dispute. As the
High Court has repeatedly emphasised:
It is well established that the terms of a commercial contract are to be
understood objectively, by what a reasonable businessperson
understood them to mean, rather than by reference to the subjectively stated
intentions of the parties to the contract.
In a practical sense, this requires
that the reasonable businessperson be placed in the position of the parties. It
is from that
perspective that the court considers the circumstances surrounding
the contract and the commercial purpose and objects to be achieved
Selak v National Tiles Co Pty
, observing that these principles had been ‘addressed and
restated in countless
authorities’,
set out the principles relating to the construction of commercial contracts in
greater detail:
The proper approach to the construction of commercial contracts was succinctly
stated by the Court of Appeal in
PCCEF Pty Ltd v Geelong Football Club Ltd
The judge set out the principles governing the construction of the Lease in a
manner that in uncontroversial. In short, the primary
duty of a court construing
a written contract is to endeavour to discover the intention of the parties from
the words of the instrument
in which the contract is embodied. The meaning of
the contractual terms is to be determined objectively, by reference to what a
business person would have understood the terms to
The proper approach
involves consideration of the language used by the parties, the surrounding
circumstances known to them and the
commercial purpose or objects to be secured
by the contract or lease.
Ordinarily, the process of construction is possible by reference to the contract
At least where the
language of the commercial contract is ambiguous or susceptible of more than one
meaning, evidence of the surrounding
circumstances is admissible to assist in
the interpretation of the

Aventus Cranbourne Thompsons Road Pty Ltd v Home
Consortium Leasehold Pty

topic in more detail, in the following terms:
The general principles applicable to the construction of contracts apply
equally to leases.
general principles to be applied in the construction of commercial contracts
were summarised by French CJ, Nettle and Gordon
Mount Bruce Mining Pty
Ltd v Wright Prospecting Pty Ltd
in the following terms:
The rights and liabilities of parties under a provision of a contract are
determined objectively, by reference to its text, context
(the entire text of
the contract as well as any contract, document or statutory provision referred
to in the text of the contact)
and purpose.
In determining the meaning of the terms of a commercial contract, it is
necessary to ask what a reasonable businessperson would have
understood those
terms to mean. That inquiry will require consideration of the language used by
the parties in the contract, the
circumstances addressed by the contract, and
the commercial purpose or objects to be secured by the contract.
Ordinarily, this process of construction is possible by reference to the
contract alone. Indeed, if an expression in a contract is
unambiguous or
susceptible of only one meaning, evidence of surrounding circumstances (events,
circumstances and things external
to the contract) cannot be adduced to
contradict its plain meaning.
However, sometimes, recourse to events, circumstances and things external to
the contract is necessary. It may be necessary in identifying
the commercial
purpose or objects of the contract where that task is facilitated by an
understanding ‘of the genesis of the
transaction, the background, the
context [and] the market in which the parties are operating’. It may be
necessary in determining
the proper construction where there is a constructional
Each of the events, circumstances and things external to the contract to
which recourse may be had is objective. What may be referred
to are events,
circumstances and things external to the contract which are known to the parties
or which assist in identifying the
purpose or object of the transaction, which
may include its history, background and context and the market in which the
parties were
operating. What is inadmissible is evidence of the parties’
statements and actions reflecting their actual intentions and expectations.
Other principles are relevant in the construction of commercial contracts.
Unless a contrary intention is indicated in the contract,
a court is entitled to
approach the task of giving a commercial contract an interpretation on the
assumption ‘that the parties
... intended to produce a commercial
result’. Put another way, a commercial contract should be construed so as
to avoid it
‘making commercial nonsense or working commercial
inconvenience’.
Ecosse Property Holdings Pty Ltd v Gee Dee Nominees Pty Ltd
Kiefel, Bell and Gordon JJ said:
It is well established that the terms of a commercial contract are to be
understood objectively, by what a reasonable businessperson
understood them to mean, rather than by reference to the subjectively stated
intentions of the parties to the contract.
In a practical sense, this requires
that the reasonable businessperson be placed in the position of the parties. It
is from that
perspective that the court considers the circumstances surrounding
the contract and the commercial purpose and objects to be achieved
Clause 4 is to be construed by reference to the commercial purpose sought to
be achieved by the terms of the lease. It follows, as
was pointed out in the
joint judgment in
Electricity Generation Corporation v Woodside Energy
, that the court is entitled to approach the task of construction of the
clause on the basis that the parties intended to produce
a commercial result,
one which makes commercial sense. It goes without saying that this requires that
the construction placed upon
cl 4 be consistent with the commercial object of
the agreement.
In addition, the Court must have regard to all of the words used in the
agreement ‘so as to render them all harmonious one with
and to ensure
the ‘congruent operation [of] the various components [as] a

Apple and Pear Australia Ltd v Pink
Lady America LLC
emphasised that while a court should construe a commercial
contract to avoid commercial nonsense, it is not part of its role to construe
agreement that otherwise has an explicable commercial result in a manner that
increases the commercial benefits to one party to
The instructive observations of the High Court in
Ecosse Property Holdings
Pty Ltd v Gee Dee Nominees Pty
regarding the
role of the honest and reasonable businessperson, and poorly drafted agreements,
also warrant extraction:
Finally, it is to be observed that, even if the resultant lease were
considered to be a remarkably poor deal from the Lessor’s
point of view
(and, to repeat, it is not obvious that it should be so regarded), the precept
that commercial contracts be construed
as it is thought an honest and reasonable
businessperson would construe them will stretch only so far. As Lord Mustill
observed in
Charter Reinsurance Co Ltd v
“There comes a point at which the court should remind itself that the
task is to discover what the parties meant from what they
said, and that to
force upon the words a meaning which they cannot fairly bear is to substitute
for the bargain actually made one
which the court believes could better have
been made. This is an illegitimate role for a court.”
Poor drafting may justify a court in being more ready to depart from the
natural and ordinary meaning of the terms of a
and no doubt, the
poorer the drafting, the less willing a court should be to be “driven by
semantic niceties to attribute to
the parties an improbably and unbusinesslike
intention”.
drafting provides “no reason to depart from the fundamental rule of
construction of contractual documents that the
intention of the parties must be
ascertained from the language they have used interpreted in the light of the
relevant factual situation
in which the contract was
Where there is
ambiguity which permits of two alternative and semantically not improbable
interpretations, construction in accordance
with what it may be supposed would
be the approach of honest and reasonable businesspersons may assist in choosing
one such alternative
over the other. But where, as here, the language and
surrounding circumstances of a commercial contract present a choice between,
the one hand, a plain, ordinary and commercially not irrational meaning of a
clause and, on the other, a meaning which is significantly
removed from the
natural and ordinary meaning of the terms of the clause, which ill-accords with
other provisions of the agreement,
and which in the end produces an outcome that
is more commercially acceptable from one of the parties’ point of view
the precept runs out of application. Unless the Anglo-Australian objective
theory of contract is now to be cast aside, the commercial
approach to
construction
is not a licence
to alter the meaning of a term that is “clear and fairly susceptible of
one meaning only” to achieve
a result that the court may think to be
reasonable.
The court is not
authorised under the guise of construction to make a new contract for the
parties at odds with the contract to which

presumption in the construction of commercial contracts, as in the
interpretation of statutes

meaning to the same words
wherever those words occur in that document, and that that applies especially to

rebuttable presumption. The particular context in which a word is used may
disclose a contrary
106 In that case, a builder contended
that it was not bound by a superintendent’s certificate as the
superintendent’s
processes had not complied with the requirements of the
contract. Specifically, it argued that in order to ‘ascertain’
cost to complete work under clause 44.6, the costs must be known with precision
and could not be estimated using experience,
judgment or discretionary
decision-making. Rejecting this
the Court referred
to the use of the word ‘ascertain’ in clause 40.5, concluding:
It is clear from the language of this clause that the parties intended by their
use of the word “ascertain” to authorise
a process of computation
which would, where necessary, involve judgment, estimation and approximation
It is to be presumed that the parties intended the word “ascertain”
to have the same meaning in cl 44.6 There is nothing
in the language or context
of cl 44.6 to suggest otherwise. It follows that they intended to authorise the
Superintendent, when carrying
out the task of “ascertainment” under
cl 44.6, to exercise judgment where necessary. What the Superintendent did ...
was therefore within the scope of the “ascertainment” function
conferred on him by cl 44.6. The parties are therefore
bound by the
Superintendent’s certificate. That conclusion is sufficient to dispose of
this ground of appeal.
F. CONSIDERATION
F.1 Is Indi entitled to Source Data, the Breakage Brief, communications
between InComm and Card Compliant, and documents relied upon
to prepare the FP
Notices, pursuant to clauses 7.2, 7.4 and 7.11?
F.1.1 The proper construction of ‘supporting information,
calculations and documentation’
107 The phrase ‘supporting
information, calculations and documentation’ must be construed according
to its natural and
ordinary meaning, understood in the commercial context in
which it appears.
108 The phrase as a whole —
‘supporting information, calculations and documentation’ — is
drafted in broad
terms. Each individual word carries wide import, and the
cumulative effect is to require provision of comprehensive material sufficient
to enable meaningful review and
verification.
109 The construction of this phrase
must also be informed by the commercial purpose and context of clause 7 as a
whole. Clause 7 establishes
a sophisticated mechanism for calculating the
Further Payment, which may amount to many millions of dollars. The calculation
on complex estimates of breakage (unspent amounts on gift cards) which
in turn depend on statistical analysis of historical spending
treatment of different card types and sales channels, and judgments about future
spending behaviour.
110 The SSA recognises that
these calculations are complex and potentially contentious. It therefore
provides for:
(a) multiple stages of
calculation and review (clauses 7.2, 7.4, 7.11,
(b) defined time periods for review and
response (clause 7.6);
(c) a structured dispute
resolution process through good faith negotiations (clause 7.10);
(d) ultimate determination by an Independent
Accountant if disputes cannot be resolved (clauses
7.13–7.14).
111 This elaborate structure would be
undermined if the phrase ‘supporting information, calculations and
documentation’
were construed narrowly. If Indi receives only summary
figures or high-level explanations, it cannot conduct the meaningful review
clause 7 contemplates. The 20 business day review period in clause 7.6 would be
illusory if Indi does not receive sufficient
information to identify whether
there are errors or grounds for
112 Moreover, the Independent Accountant
process under clause 7.13 expressly contemplates that the Independent Accountant
will ‘review
the documents submitted by the relevant parties’ and
may ‘request specific historical documents’. If Indi is to
effective submissions to the Independent Accountant, it must have access to the
same underlying information that InComm possesses.
Information asymmetry would
fundamentally compromise the fairness of the Independent Accountant
113 The commercial purpose of requiring
provision of ‘supporting information, calculations and
documentation’ is therefore
clear: to enable informed review, to
facilitate identification of any errors or disputes, to support good faith
negotiations, and
to ensure that any Independent Accountant determination is
based on complete information. This purpose can only be achieved if the
is given its natural, broad meaning.
evident from the foregoing authorities, it is a well-established principle of
contractual interpretation that the same words
appearing in different parts of a
contract should, absent contextual indications to the contrary, be given the
same meaning.
115 The phrase ‘together with
supporting information, calculations and documentation’ appears in
substantially identical
form in clauses 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, 7.11(a) and 7.12(a).
There is no apparent reason why this phrase should bear different meanings in
different clauses. Indeed, consistency of interpretation promotes certainty and
accords with commercial common sense.
7.12 is particularly instructive. Under clause 7.12(a), InComm must calculate
the December 22 Breakage (Final) and related
figures itself, without reliance on
Card Compliant reports. The calculation must be ‘provide[d]... together
with supporting
information, calculations and documentation’. It is
self-evident that such calculations cannot be made, nor meaningfully reviewed,
without access to the underlying Source Data from TCNAdmin. The December 22
Breakage (Final) must be based on actual data regarding
card balances, expiry
dates, and amounts spent — precisely the information contained in Source
117 If ‘supporting information,
calculations and documentation’ in clause 7.12 in respect of the
calculation of the December
22 Breakage (Final) necessarily includes Source
Data, the same phrase in clauses 7.2, 7.4 and 7.11 must bear the same meaning.
hold otherwise would be to treat identical contractual language
inconsistently without justification.
118 Similarly,
clause 7.1 requires the Sellers to provide calculations ‘together with
supporting information, calculations and
documentation’. Although there is
no time limit imposed on this obligation in clause 7.1, the presence or absence
of time limits
in particular clauses does not alter what constitutes
‘supporting information, calculations and documentation’ —
merely affects when such material must be provided.
F.1.2 The significance of the Card Compliant reports being based on
Source Data
119 Mr Mould conceded in
cross-examination that the Card Compliant reports were dependent on the Source
Data extracted from TCNAdmin.
This concession is significant.
120 If Card
Compliant’s calculations and reports are based on Source Data then that
Source Data necessarily forms part of the
‘supporting information,
calculations and documentation’ for the breakage estimates. One cannot
properly review, verify
or understand Card Compliant’s methodology and
conclusions without access to the underlying data upon which those conclusions
121 This is particularly so given the
complexities acknowledged in the SSA itself. Schedule 7 recognises
different treatment for different
sales channels (grocery versus B2B), different
card products with varying characteristics, and the need to consider ‘the
transaction code mapping schedule’. These matters cannot be
meaningfully assessed without the underlying data.
F.1.3 The discrepancies in Issue Amounts
122 The evidence reveals troubling
discrepancies in Issue Amounts, being the value of gift cards sold in CY22,
across the various
materials provided by InComm. These discrepancies amount to
approximately $1.5 million, a figure that Indi notes is not insubstantial
context of breakage calculations.
123 Mr Mould
explained, in cross-examination, that these discrepancies arose from
‘kick-outs’, that is, cards excluded
from calculations due to data
inconsistencies. However, the Card Compliant PDF reports indicated kick-outs
totalling only approximately
$21,000, creating a further unexplained discrepancy
of significant magnitude.
124 These inconsistencies
cannot be investigated, explained or resolved without access to the Source Data.
The very existence of these
discrepancies demonstrates why Source Data
constitutes necessary ‘supporting information’ — without it,
Indi cannot
understand whether InComm’s calculations are correct or
whether errors have been made.
F.1.4 InComm’s construction arguments
125 InComm advances several arguments
against requiring provision of Source Data.
126 First, it points to Part 3 of Schedule 7, which
provides that ‘Card Compliant has final determination of its calculations
and report’. InComm submits this demonstrates that the parties intended to
rely on Card Compliant’s expertise without
requiring granular scrutiny of
underlying data.
127 This argument cannot be
accepted. The phrase ‘final determination’ in the context of the
Breakage Brief refers to
Card Compliant’s methodology and professional
judgment in conducting its analysis — it does not operate to shield the
underlying data from review.
Compliant’s ‘final determination’ must still be reviewable by
Indi to enable Indi to exercise its rights
under clauses 7.6–7.10 to
disagree with InComm’s calculations and engage in good faith
negotiations.
129 Moreover, the Independent
Accountant dispute resolution process in clauses 7.13–7.14 contemplates
substantive review of
‘Disputed FP Matters’. This process would be
meaningless if Indi were denied access to the foundational data necessary
formulate and support its position. An Independent Accountant cannot determine
disputed breakage calculations without access to
Source Data, and Indi must have
that same data to prepare its
submissions.
130 Secondly, InComm contends that the
structure of clause 7 provides for an ‘expedient process’ with
limited review windows,
and that requiring provision of Source Data is
inconsistent with this expedited structure. InComm characterises the earlier
as provisional, with stage five (the Final FP Notice under clause 7.12)
being the ‘main game’.
submission misconceives the operation of clause 7. While the SSA does provide
time limits for review and dispute, these limits
operate to ensure the process
moves forward — they do not diminish the content of what must be provided
at each stage. The
20 business day review period in clause 7.6 requires Indi to
act promptly, but it does not permit InComm to provide inadequate information
the first place.
132 Further, Indi has consistently
and promptly sought additional information at each stage. Its requests for
Source Data in respect
of the Second Estimate (clause 7.4) and Third Estimate
(clause 7.11) were made within the applicable time frames. The fact that those
stages have now passed does not retrospectively validate InComm’s failure
to provide required information.
133 Thirdly, InComm
submits that, if the parties had intended to require provision of Source Data,
they could have said so explicitly.
By the same logic, if parties had intended
‘supporting information, calculations and documentation’ to exclude
Data, they could have said so explicitly. The question is what the phrase
means as a matter of construction, not whether it could
have been drafted more
134 The phrase ‘supporting
information, calculations and documentation’ is naturally apt to capture
underlying data. ‘Supporting
information’ is a broad phrase that
encompasses material that underlies, explains or substantiates the calculations
Source Data plainly falls within this description.
F.1.5 Conclusion on Source Data
135 For these reasons, I find that
‘supporting information, calculations and documentation’ in clauses
7.2, 7.4 and 7.11
includes Source Data. InComm was obliged to provide Source
Data under these clauses and has failed to do so. Indi is entitled to
requiring provision of that material.
F.1.6 The Breakage Brief
136 The Breakage Brief is defined in
clause 1 of the SSA as ‘the instructions to Card Compliant to be given by
the Buyer for
the reports for Breakage in clause 7 accounting for paragraphs (b)
and (d) of Part 2 of Schedule 7, as set out in Part 3 of Schedule
137 Part 3 of Schedule 7 specifies the
matters that Card Compliant ‘must be instructed’ to consider,
including the differences
between ‘grocery’ and
‘corporate/B2B’ sales, each product channel based on a program
profile, all card data
for the relevant period as compiled by TCN, the specific
transaction code mapping schedule, and the Australian market
characteristics.
138 Clauses 7.2(a), 7.4(a) and
7.11(a)(i) each expressly require InComm to procure Card Compliant to
‘calculate and provide
a report (on the basis of the Breakage
Brief)’. This makes clear that the Card Compliant reports are to be
prepared following
the instructions and parameters set out in the Breakage
F.1.7 The relationship between Source Data and the Breakage
139 The Breakage Brief likely includes or
incorporates the Source Data, given that Part 3(c) of Schedule 7 refers to
data for the relevant period as compiled by the Company’.
However, the Breakage Brief is broader than Source Data alone. It
encompasses
not merely the raw data, but the instructions, specifications, and contextual
information necessary to enable Card Compliant
to analyse that data in
accordance with the SSA’s requirements — including how different
sales channels are to be treated,
which product channels are to be analysed, how
transaction codes are to be mapped, and what methodologies are to be
140 The Breakage Brief is plainly
‘supporting information’ and ‘documentation’ within the
meaning of clauses
7.2, 7.4 and 7.11. It is the foundational instructional
document that defines the scope and parameters of Card Compliant’s
Without it, Indi cannot verify that Card Compliant was properly instructed in
accordance with Part 3 of Schedule 7, or that
the instructions given align with
the contractual requirements.
141 InComm’s
submission that Part 3 of Schedule 7 acknowledges ‘Card Compliant has
final determination of its calculations
and report’ does not assist. As
discussed above, this phrase relates to Card Compliant’s professional
methodology and
judgement — it does not shield the instructions Card
Compliant was given from scrutiny. The very purpose of defining and requiring
Breakage Brief is to ensure that Card Compliant’s analysis is conducted on
a specified basis aligned with the SSA’s
requirements. If the Breakage
Brief actually provided by InComm to Card Compliant departed materially from
Part 3 of Schedule 7,
this would be a matter Indi is entitled to identify and
142 Part 3 of Schedule 7 refers to specific
documents that form part of the Breakage Brief: the program profile identifying
and channel characteristics (Part 3(b)), card data for the relevant
period (Part 3(c)), and the transaction code mapping schedule
(Part 3(d)). Card
Compliant cannot conduct its analysis based solely on the contractual language
in Schedule 7 — it requires
specific, concrete instructions identifying
the actual data sources, files, transaction codes, product channels, and other
for TCN’s particular business and the particular reporting
143 Notwithstanding the evidence relating to
the provision of instruction profiles on 16 April 2025, InComm’s
evidence does
not clearly address whether the Breakage Brief was provided to
Indi. Given the technical nature of the information Card Compliant
(data files, transaction codes, product specifications), these instructions must
have taken documentary form — whether
as briefing documents, email
instructions, data specifications, or some combination thereof.
144 I am therefore satisfied that the Breakage
Brief — being the actual instructions, data specifications, and supporting
provided by InComm/TCN to Card Compliant for each report under clauses
7.2(a), 7.4(a) and 7.11(a)(i) — constitutes ‘supporting
information,
calculations and documentation’ that InComm was required to provide and
must now provide to Indi.
145 This encompasses:
(a) all briefing documents,
instructions, or data specifications provided to Card
(b) the program profiles identifying
product characteristics (Part 3(b) of
Schedule 7);
(c) the transaction code mapping
schedule (Part 3(d) of Schedule 7);
(d) data files
regarding card data for the relevant period (Part 3(c) of Schedule 7), to the
extent not already provided as Source
(e) any supplementary instructions,
clarifications, or modifications provided to Card Compliant.
146 To the extent the Source Data forms
part of the Breakage Brief, there is no need for duplicate production.
F.1.6 Communications with Card Compliant
147 Indi also seeks communications
between InComm and Card Compliant relating to the preparation of the Card
Compliant reports. Mr
Mould gave evidence that instructions provided by InComm
to Card Compliant took the form of emails or occurred during Teams meetings
conversations.
communications as exist fall within ‘supporting information’ or
‘documentation’ to the extent that
they relate to the preparation of
the Card Compliant reports required under clauses 7.2(a), 7.4(a) and 7.11(a)(i).
Instructions given
to Card Compliant, clarifications sought or provided, and any
exchanges regarding methodology or data issues would all constitute
supporting documentation.
149 The Breakage Brief
defined in Schedule 7 and the SSA’s express references to Card Compliant
being instructed ‘on the
basis of the Breakage Brief’ make clear
that communications between InComm and Card Compliant are part of the
documentation
trail for the Card Compliant reports. To the extent such
communications exist, they must be provided. This would include the Breakage
Brief itself, to the extent that it extends beyond the Source Data.
F.1.7 Documents relied upon to prepare the FP Notices
150 The FP Notices under clauses 7.4 and
7.11 were based on material provided to and received from Card Compliant. The
evidence establishes
that InComm extracted Source Data from TCNAdmin and
provided it to Card Compliant, which in turn used that Source Data to prepare
its reports calculating breakage estimates. InComm then took those Card
Compliant reports into consideration (as expressly required
by clauses 7.4 and
7.11) in calculating the December 22 EBITDA estimates and the Further Payment
set out in the FP Notices.
151 It follows that the
Source Data provided to Card Compliant, and the reports and working files
received from Card Compliant, are
foundational documents underlying
InComm’s calculations. Without access to these materials, Indi cannot
verify whether the
Card Compliant reports are correct, and therefore cannot
verify whether InComm’s calculations based on those reports are
152 The provision of
‘hard-coded’ spreadsheets without underlying formulas or data
sources compounds this problem. Such
spreadsheets show only final results, not
the calculation process or the data inputs. They do not permit meaningful
verification.
This is particularly significant given the SSA’s provision
for dispute resolution by an Independent Accountant. Both Indi (in
submissions) and the Independent Accountant (in determining disputes) will
require access to the Source Data provided to
Card Compliant and the reports
received from Card Compliant. These materials cannot sensibly be excluded from
‘supporting information,
calculations and
documentation’.
153 The discrepancies in Issue
Amounts across different FP Notices, which Mr Mould explained resulted from
‘kick-outs’,
demonstrate why access to the underlying Source Data is
necessary. Without that data, Indi cannot understand which cards were included
or excluded from calculations, or verify the correctness of those decisions.
F.2 Is Indi entitled to the information, including underlying ledgers and
sample invoices relating to the calculation of the December
22 EBITDA (Base)
pursuant to clause 7.2?
154 Clause 7.2(b) requires InComm to
‘calculate the December 22 EBITDA (Base)’ and clause 7.2 requires
provision of this
calculation ‘together with supporting information,
calculations and documentation’.
submits that the parties have agreed to the December 22 EBITDA (Base) figure and
therefore no further information need
be provided. Indi responds that its
entitlement to underlying documentation is independent of whether agreement has
been reached,
and remains relevant because the December 22 EBITDA (Base) is
carried forward into subsequent calculations.
accept Indi’s submission on this point. The December 22 EBITDA (Base) is
not a standalone figure — it is expressly
incorporated into subsequent
calculations under clauses 7.4(b), 7.11(a)(ii) and 7.12(a)(ii).
157 Part 2(e) of Schedule 7 provides that the
‘December 22 EBITDA (Base) must be calculated using the EBITDA derived
December 22 Accounts’. Part 2(f) then provides that the December
22 EBITDA (Second Estimate), (Third Estimate) and (Final)
must all be
‘calculated using the December 22 EBITDA (Base) adjusted to include’
the relevant breakage estimates.
158 Thus, the
December 22 EBITDA (Base) is a foundational figure that flows through every
subsequent stage of the Further Payment
calculation. Any error in that figure
would carry through and affect the ultimate Further Payment. Indi is entitled to
correctness of this foundational
159 Mr Mould conceded, in cross-examination,
that it would be necessary to consider underlying ledgers and sample invoices to
a view about the correctness of the December 22 EBITDA (Base) calculation.
He also acknowledged that Indi does not have access to
that information. This
evidence supports the conclusion that such material constitutes
‘supporting information’ or ‘documentation’
purposes of clause 7.2.
160 General ledgers
recording the revenue and expenses of TCN during CY22 are clearly supporting
information for the calculation of
December 22 EBITDA (Base). These ledgers show
the transactions from which EBITDA is derived and are necessary to verify that
calculation has been performed correctly and in accordance with Schedule
161 Sample invoices and underlying transactional
records provide a further level of verification. While every invoice need not be
produced (a matter I address further below in considering clause 7.16(b)), some
representative samples are reasonably required to
verify that ledger entries
accurately reflect the underlying business
transactions.
162 InComm’s suggestion that
agreement to the December 22 EBITDA (Base) precludes any entitlement to
supporting documentation
must be rejected. First, it is not clear that Indi has
unconditionally agreed to the figure — Indi’s correspondence has
consistently maintained that InComm has not provided adequate supporting
information. Secondly, even if there has been practical
agreement for the
purposes of progressing through the clause 7 process, this does not waive
Indi’s contractual entitlement
to the supporting information to which it
is entitled.
163 The commercial purpose of requiring
provision of supporting information is to enable informed review and
verification. This purpose
is not defeated simply because parties reach
pragmatic agreement to proceed to the next stage. Indi remains entitled to
correctness of calculations that affect the ultimate Further Payment,
particularly given that the matter may proceed to Independent
determination.
164 I therefore consider that Indi is
entitled to general ledgers and a reasonable sample of underlying invoices and
transactional
records relating to the calculation of December 22 EBITDA (Base)
pursuant to clause 7.2.
F.3 Has InComm provided the Card Compliant reports?
165 Clauses 7.2(a), 7.4(a) and 7.11(a)(i)
each require InComm to ‘procure Card Compliant, LLC or its successor... to
and provide a report’ for specified breakage
166 The evidence establishes that InComm
has provided two categories of documents it characterises as fulfilling this
obligation:
(a) the Card Compliant PDF
reports produced in March 2023, February 2024 and November 2024;
(b) spreadsheets containing what Mr Mould
described as extracts from Card Compliant reports (the purported Card Compliant
167 Indi submits that neither category
satisfies the contractual requirement.
relation to the Card Compliant PDF reports, Indi points to extensive redactions
and the fact that the reports cover a transaction
period from 2019 to 2024,
rather than focusing on CY22.
169 In relation to
the purported Card Compliant reports, Indi submits these are merely spreadsheets
containing extracts rather than
the actual reports themselves.
F.3.1 The Card Compliant PDF reports
170 The Card Compliant PDF reports cannot
be accepted as fulfilling InComm’s obligations under clauses 7.2(a),
7.4(a) and 7.11(a)(i)
for several
171 First, these reports were produced only
in July 2025,
long after the
deadlines for provision of reports under clauses 7.2 (which required provision
within 40 business days after 31 December
2022), 7.4 (which required provision
within 40 business days after 31 December 2023) and 7.11 (which required
provision within 40
business days after 31 December 2024). While timing alone
might not be fatal if the reports were ultimately provided, the late production
compounds the other deficiencies.
172 Secondly, many
of the reports are extensively redacted. Large portions of the reports are
blacked out, preventing Indi from understanding
Card Compliant’s full
methodology, assumptions and calculations. A redacted report cannot constitute
adequate provision of
a report for the purposes of enabling review under clauses
173 Thirdly, and most significantly,
the reports do not provide the calculations specifically required by the
relevant clauses. Clauses
7.2(a)(i), 7.4(a)(i) and 7.11(a)(i) each require
reports ‘for the’ specified breakage estimates — that is,
on CY22 gift cards. The Card Compliant PDF reports span either
2019–2022 or 2019–2024, making it difficult or impossible
to extract the specific CY22 calculations
174 Fourthly, Mr Mould’s evidence
did not clearly identify the Card Compliant PDF reports as the documents InComm
relies upon
to fulfill its obligations under clauses 7.2(a), 7.4(a) and
7.11(a)(i). Instead, InComm’s submissions focus on the purported
Compliant reports contained in
spreadsheets.
F.3.2 The purported Card
Compliant reports in spreadsheets
submits that the spreadsheets it has provided — containing tabs with Card
Compliant logos and calculations —
constitute the Card Compliant reports
required under clauses 7.2(a), 7.4(a) and
7.11(a)(i).
176 This submission cannot be accepted.
The evidence establishes that these spreadsheets were prepared by Mr Mould and
contain extracts
or summaries from Card Compliant reports, not the reports
themselves. Mr Mould confirmed, in cross-examination, that the spreadsheet
were extracts of Card Compliant reports, not complete
contractual obligation is to ‘procure Card Compliant, LLC ... to calculate
and provide a report’. This language
contemplates Card Compliant producing
a report, not InComm or TCN personnel extracting portions of Card Compliant
material and incorporating
spreadsheets.
178 The distinction is material. A
report prepared by Card Compliant would include:
(a) Card Compliant’s
methodology and assumptions;
(b) explanations of how
data was treated;
(c) discussion of any data quality
issues or adjustments;
(d) Card Compliant’s
professional conclusions and qualifications;
(e) complete calculations showing how final
figures were derived.
179 By contrast, spreadsheet extracts
prepared by Mr Mould may omit relevant context, methodology and explanatory
material. They present
selected numbers without the supporting narrative and
analysis that would be included in a proper
180 Moreover, the fact that these
spreadsheet tabs are ‘hard-coded’ — containing only final
numbers without the
underlying formulas or data — reinforces that they are
summaries rather than the actual reports. The SSA does not contemplate
of summaries; it requires provision of the reports
themselves.
181 InComm’s reliance on Mr
Mould’s evidence that Card Compliant provided reports containing CY22 data
alongside data
from other years, and that other data was simply
‘removed’, does not assist. If Card Compliant provided reports,
reports should have been provided to Indi in the form Card Compliant
prepared them (subject to any legitimate redactions for proprietary
information
unrelated to the SSA calculations). What should not occur is InComm filtering or
restructuring Card Compliant’s
reports and then claiming to have provided
‘the Card Compliant reports’.
therefore satisfied that InComm has not provided the Card Compliant reports
required under clauses 7.2(a), 7.4(a) and 7.11(a)(i).
InComm must provide the
actual reports prepared by Card Compliant in unredacted form to the extent they
relate to the calculations
required under the SSA.
F.4 Is Indi alternatively entitled to the Source Data, Breakage Brief,
Card Compliant reports and communications, and documents relied
upon to prepare
the FP Notices
under clause 7.16(a)?
183 Clause 7.16 provides an independent
basis upon which Indi may seek information. Given my conclusions above that Indi
is entitled
to Source Data and other materials under clauses 7.2, 7.4 and 7.11,
the question of clause 7.16(a) arises only as an alternative
entitlement.
184 Clause 7.16(a) requires InComm to
procure TCN to ‘permit representatives of the Buyer and the Sellers to
have access to
and take extracts from the books, correspondence, accounts or
other records relating to the Group as the Buyer or the Sellers reasonably
request in relation to the preparation of, review of, and agreement to, the
draft and final (as applicable) FP Notice and Final FP
185 InComm’s primary submission
is that this clause has ‘expired’ because the time periods for
review of the FP
Notices under clauses 7.6 and 7.10(b) have passed. InComm
characterises the review and agreement process as being ‘in the rear-view
mirror’ and suggests that clause 7.16(a) is no longer
186 This construction must be rejected
for several reasons.
F.4.1 The ongoing nature of the review and agreement
187 First, the FP Notices have not been
agreed. Indi has consistently disputed the calculations in the notices provided
under clauses
7.4 and 7.11. Clause 7.6 provides a 20 business day period for
Indi to examine and review, but if Indi disagrees (as it has), clause
applies and requires Indi to set out Disputed FP
188 Clause 7.10(a) then requires the
parties to ‘enter into good faith negotiations and use all reasonable
endeavours to agree
the Disputed FP Matters’. If agreement is not reached
within 20 business days after delivery of the Sellers FP Report, clause
provides for partial payment and deferral of disputed
189 The matter then proceeds through
further stages under clauses 7.11 and 7.12, potentially culminating in
Independent Accountant
determination under clauses 7.13 and 7.14. Indi’s
Sellers FP Reports in respect of both the FP Notice and 2nd FP Notice set
numerous Disputed FP Matters that remain
unresolved.
190 In these circumstances, it cannot be
said that the process of ‘review of, and agreement to’ the FP
Notices has concluded.
To the contrary, that process is ongoing and will
continue through to final determination. The fact that the initial 20 business
day review periods have expired does not mean the substantive review process is
191 This interpretation gives commercial
efficacy to clause 7.16(a). The alternative construction advanced by InComm
would render
the clause nugatory in any disputed case. Whenever Indi disagreed
with a calculation and the 20 business day period expired without
InComm could claim that clause 7.16(a) had ceased to operate. This would mean
that clause 7.16(a) could never be relied
upon to obtain information necessary
for good faith negotiations under clause 7.10(a) or for preparing submissions to
an Independent
Accountant under clause
192 Such a construction would be commercially
absurd. The parties cannot have intended that Indi’s entitlement to access
information
would evaporate at precisely the time when information is most
needed — when calculations are disputed and must be resolved
negotiation or independent determination.
F.4.2 The relationship between clauses 7.2, 7.4, 7.11 and clause
193 Secondly, InComm’s construction
fails to account for the relationship between the specific obligations in
clauses 7.2, 7.4
and 7.11 and the more general access right in clause
194 As I have found above, clauses 7.2, 7.4
and 7.11 require provision of supporting information, calculations and
documentation —
including Source Data — at the time the relevant
calculations are provided. Clause 7.16(a) operates as a complementary mechanism
enabling Indi to request additional access if needed for review and agreement
195 The fact that Indi has requested
Source Data under clause 7.16(a) does not mean that clause is the exclusive or
even primary basis
of entitlement. Rather, Indi properly relies on clause
7.16(a) as an alternative ground in circumstances where InComm disputes its
obligations under clauses 7.2, 7.4 and
196 Moreover, the temporal sequence supports
Indi’s construction. Indi made requests for information under clause
7.16(a) both
within and after the initial review periods. The initial requests
were made promptly when Indi determined that the material provided
under clauses
7.4 and 7.11 was insufficient. The fact that InComm refused to provide the
requested material, necessitating this proceeding,
does not transform
Indi’s timely requests into tardy ones.
F.4.3 The concept of flow-through between stages
197 Thirdly, the commercial operation of
clause 7 supports an interpretation that permits ongoing access to information.
198 The December 22 EBITDA (Base) calculated at the
clause 7.2 stage is expressly carried forward into all subsequent calculations
under clauses 7.4, 7.11 and 7.12. Similarly, breakage estimates are refined
through successive stages as more data becomes
199 This structure of ‘flowing
through’ figures from earlier stages to later stages means that
information and calculations
from earlier stages remain relevant throughout the
entire process. Indi’s ability to review and agree (or dispute)
calculations
at later stages necessarily depends upon being able to verify the
correctness of foundational figures from earlier
200 If Indi discovered an error in the
December 22 EBITDA (Base) while reviewing the December 22 EBITDA (Second
Estimate), it would
be entitled to raise that error as a Disputed FP Matter even
though the ‘stage’ for calculating the December 22 EBITDA
notionally passed. This demonstrates that the obligations to provide supporting
information at earlier stages are not
extinguished simply because time has moved
201 Clause 7.16(a) facilitates this ongoing
review function by ensuring Indi can access relevant records as needed to verify
calculations
that span multiple stages.
F.4.4 Reasonableness of Indi’s requests
202 InComm submits that even if clause
7.16(a) remains operative, Indi’s requests are
unreasonable.
203 The reasonableness of specific
requests is better addressed in the context of clause 7.16(b) and Mr
Carruth’s detailed requests.
However, I note that requests for Source Data
and Card Compliant reports are plainly reasonable in circumstances where:
(a) these materials are
necessary to verify calculations affecting millions of dollars in potential
Further Payment;
(b) significant discrepancies have
been identified in the materials InComm has
(c) the SSA contemplates detailed review
potentially culminating in Independent Accountant determination;
(d) the materials requested are within
InComm’s possession or control through its ownership of
204 Nothing in clause 7.16(a) limits
reasonable requests to only those materials that InComm was required to provide
under clauses
7.2, 7.4 and 7.11. The phrase ‘books, correspondence,
accounts or other records relating to the Group’ is deliberately
long as materials are reasonably required for reviewing and determining the FP
Notices, they fall within the scope of clause
205 I therefore consider that clause
7.16(a) provides an alternative basis for Indi’s entitlement to Source
Data, the Breakage
Brief, Card Compliant reports, communications and documents
relied on to prepare the FP Notices. The clause remains operative and
Indi’s requests are reasonable.
F.5 Is Indi entitled to the material sought by Mr Carruth pursuant to
clause 7.16(b)?
206 Clause 7.16(b) requires InComm to
procure TCN to ‘provide or ensure the provision of all information and
assistance that
may reasonably be requested by the advisers of the Buyer and the
Sellers in relation to the preparation of, review of, and agreement
draft and final (as applicable) FP Notice and Final FP
207 Indi relies on the Carruth Report
and supplementary report as articulating the information Mr Carruth requires to
conduct his
review. The categories of documents sought by Mr Carruth are set out
in Annexure D to the Carruth Report, reproduced at paragraph
F.5.1 Has clause 7.16(b) expired?
208 As with clause 7.16(a), InComm
submits that clause 7.16(b) has expired because the review periods for the FP
Notices have passed.
For the reasons set out above in relation to clause
7.16(a), I reject this submission.
209 The clause
expressly extends to ‘the preparation of, review of, and agreement
to’ the notices. The process of reaching
agreement is ongoing and will
continue through good faith negotiations and potentially Independent Accountant
determination. Mr Carruth
is Indi’s adviser for this process and is
entitled to request information reasonably required for that
210 Indeed, Mr Carruth’s
supplementary report was prepared for the specific purpose of advising Indi in
respect of submissions
to an Independent Accountant. This falls squarely within
the purpose identified in clause 7.16(b).
F.5.2 Is Mr Carruth appropriately qualified?
211 InComm challenges Mr Carruth’s
expertise, suggesting he lacks specific experience in breakage calculations and
is primarily
an audit specialist.
submission does not withstand scrutiny. Mr Carruth is a chartered accountant
with extensive experience in business valuations,
financial investigations and
dispute resolution. His role is not to independently calculate breakage using
his own methodology, but
rather to review whether InComm’s calculations
have been performed correctly and in accordance with the
213 This is quintessentially work for which an
experienced accountant is qualified. It requires understanding financial
statements,
verifying calculations, checking that methodologies align with
contractual requirements, and identifying discrepancies or errors.
Carruth’s expertise is appropriate for these
214 Moreover, the SSA itself contemplates
that accountants will review these calculations. Clause 7.2(c) requires the
December 22
Accounts to be prepared ‘by JM... in consultation with Walker
Wayland’. Clause 7.13 provides for disputes to be determined
‘Independent Accountant’. The parties clearly intended that
accountants would be involved in reviewing and determining
the calculations in
F.5.3 Are Mr Carruth’s requests reasonable?
215 The more substantial question is
whether the specific categories of documents requested by Mr Carruth are
reasonable within the
meaning of clause
216 Clause 7.16(b) requires provision of
‘all information and assistance that may reasonably be requested by the
advisers of
the Buyer and the Sellers in relation to the preparation of, review
of, and agreement to, the draft and final (as applicable) FP
Notice and Final FP
217 The test is therefore whether the
information Mr Carruth has requested:
(a) is reasonably required
for the purpose of preparing for, reviewing, or reaching agreement on the FP
Notices; and
(b) is not unreasonable having regard
to the burden on InComm/TCN in providing it.
218 ‘Reasonable’ in this
context must be assessed by reference to:
(a) the nature and complexity
of the calculations being reviewed;
(b) the amount
at stake (potentially many millions of dollars in Further
(c) the information actually required to
conduct an informed review;
(d) the burden on
InComm/TCN in providing the information; and
specificity and clarity of the requests.
F.5.4 General principles applicable to all items
219 The 14 items in Mr Carruth’s
table fall into several categories:
(a) Items requiring
foundational accounting records (Completion Statement, general ledgers,
(b) Items requiring working papers and
calculations showing how EBITDA and breakage figures were
(c) Items requiring Card Compliant reports
and related documentation;
(d) Items requiring
specific supporting documentation (commission models, normalisation adjustments,
transaction code mappings).
220 These are all standard categories of
financial documentation that would be maintained in the ordinary course of
business by a
company of TCN’s nature and size. Mr Mould conceded in
cross-examination that general ledgers are readily available. InComm
provided evidence that compliance with these requests would be unduly burdensome
or impractical.
221 The requests are directed to
verifying calculations that determine the Further Payment, involving potentially
many millions of
dollars. They represent the type of information that an
experienced forensic accountant would properly require to conduct a thorough
informed review in order to advise Indi on whether to agree to the FP Notices or
what Disputed FP Matters to raise.
F.5.5 Analysis of specific items
F.5.5.1 Items 1-3 (Completion Statement, Accounts and EBITDA)
222 These items seek the Completion
Statement, general ledgers, underlying transactional records, and working papers
supporting the
Completion Accounts, Completion EBITDA and Completion Breakage
223 These are plainly reasonable requests
for an adviser reviewing the FP Notices. The Completion Breakage Amount is a
critical component
of the Breakage Differential Amount calculation, which
directly affects the Further Payment under the formula in clause 7.5. To advise
Indi on whether InComm’s calculation of the Further Payment is correct, Mr
Carruth must be able to verify the foundational
figures that feed into that
calculation. Without access to the Completion Statement, the underlying
accounts, and the working papers
showing how these figures were calculated, Mr
Carruth cannot properly advise Indi on whether to agree to the FP
224 General ledgers are essential to
substantiate reported figures. Mr Mould conceded they are readily available,
indicating that
provision would not be burdensome. The request for underlying
transactional records is qualified by the term ‘sample’,
that exhaustive production is not sought — only sufficient documentation
to verify the accuracy of the ledger entries
and the consistent application of
accounting policies.
F.5.5.2 Items 4-5 (December 2022 Accounts)
225 Item 4 seeks general ledgers,
underlying transactional records, and supporting documentation for the December
2022 Accounts.
226 For the same reasons as Items
1-3, this is reasonable. The December 2022 Accounts form the foundation for
December 2022 EBITDA
(Base), which is carried forward through all subsequent
Further Payment calculations under clauses 7.4, 7.11 and 7.12. An adviser
reviewing the FP Notices must be able to verify the accuracy of this
foundational figure. Without the underlying accounts and ledgers,
cannot properly advise Indi on whether the Further Payment has been correctly
calculated.
227 Indi no longer seeks Item 5, which
related to confirmation regarding preparation of the December 2022 Accounts.
Accordingly, I
need not address it further.
F.5.5.3 Items 6-8 (December 2022 EBITDA)
228 These items seek general ledgers,
underlying transactional records, working papers, and documentation of
normalisation adjustments
for the December 2022 EBITDA calculations.
229 December 2022 EBITDA is one of the two
principal variables in the Further Payment formula under clause 7.5. To advise
whether to agree to the FP Notices, Mr Carruth must be able to verify
this critical figure. This requires access to the general ledgers
EBITDA is derived, working papers showing how the calculations were performed,
and documentation of any normalisation
adjustments.
230 Schedule 7 prescribes specific
normalisation adjustments that must be made to EBITDA. These adjustments can
materially affect
the Further Payment. Documents showing what normalisation
adjustments were made, their quantum, and how they were calculated are
information that an adviser would reasonably require to verify whether the
EBITDA calculations are correct. Without this
information, Mr Carruth cannot
advise Indi on whether the Further Payment calculation should be accepted or
F.5.5.4 Items 9-12 (December 2022 Breakage calculations)
231 These items seek the original Card
Compliant reports and working files, clarification of which cards were
included/excluded from
Card Compliant’s analysis, documentation of
assumptions and methodologies and the commission model with supporting
documentation.
232 Breakage is the other principal
variable in the Further Payment formula. The accuracy of the breakage estimate
is critical to
the Further Payment calculation. To advise Indi on whether the
breakage figures in the FP Notices are correct, Mr Carruth requires
this material (to the extent that InComm is in possession of
233 Without this information, Mr Carruth cannot
understand how the breakage figures were derived, whether the methodology is
or whether errors may have been made. An adviser cannot reasonably be
expected to advise a client to agree to a multi-million dollar
Further Payment
calculation without being able to verify the breakage estimates underlying that
calculation.
234 The request is particularly
reasonable given the evidence of discrepancies in Issue Amounts across different
FP Notices, unexplained
differences between ‘kick-outs’ in various
materials, and the absence of clarity about the data and methodology used
Card Compliant.
F.5.5.5 Items 13-14 (Breakage Differential Amount)
235 These items seek the Completion
Statement with underlying source data and assumptions, and documentation
supporting the Final
Breakage Amount. The Completion Breakage Amount and Final
Breakage Amount are the two components of the Breakage Differential Amount
calculation under clause 7.4(c), which directly affects the Further Payment.
These are foundational figures.
Without this
information, Mr Carruth cannot verify the correctness of the Breakage
Differential Amount or advise Indi on whether to
agree to the FP Notices. These
are plainly reasonable requests for an adviser engaged to review complex
financial calculations affecting
a potential multi-million dollar payment.
F.5.6 Qualification regarding underlying transactional
236 Items 2, 4 and 6 request
‘underlying transactional records (including sample invoices and purchase
orders)’. The phrase
‘underlying transactional records’ is
potentially very broad and could encompass every source document for every
transaction.
For a business conducting thousands of gift card sales through
multiple channels, this could be
voluminous.
237 However, the parenthetical reference
to ‘sample’ invoices provides important limitation. A reasonable
interpretation
is that Mr Carruth requires representative samples across
transaction types and channels sufficient to verify that:
(a) ledger entries accurately
reflect business transactions;
(b) accounting
policies have been consistently applied;
(c) unusual, material or non-standard
transactions are properly documented.
238 ‘Samples’ should be
understood as representative examples, not exhaustive production of all
transaction records. If
the parties cannot agree on an appropriate sampling
methodology, they may apply to the Court for directions.
F.5.7 Conclusion
239 I find that Indi is entitled to the
categories of documents set out in Items 1–14 of Mr Carruth’s table
(other than
Item 5, which Indi no longer seeks), subject to the following
qualifications:
(a) ‘Underlying
transactional records’ in Items 2, 4 and 6 should be understood as
requiring representative samples across
transaction types and channels, not
exhaustive production of every transaction
(b) Sample invoices and purchase orders
should be sufficient in number and type to verify ledger accuracy and accounting
policy application,
but need not encompass every invoice and purchase order for
the relevant period;
(c) Item 10 can be satisfied by
a document or statement explaining which card products and issue amounts were
included or excluded
from Card Compliant’s analysis and the reasons for
any exclusions.
240 If the parties cannot agree on an
appropriate sampling methodology for underlying transactional records, or if
disputes arise
directions.
241 The provision of these categories of
documents and information is necessary to enable Indi, through Mr Carruth, to
conduct the
informed and thorough review that clause 7.16(b) contemplates. The
requests are reasonable in the context of the potentially substantial
Payment at stake, the complexity of the calculations involved, and the detailed
verification process prescribed by clause
7 of the SSA.
F.6 Is Indi entitled to the Power BI extracts?
242 Indi’s request for current
versions of Power BI extracts attached to Mr Mould’s email of 31 October
2023 raises different
considerations.
243 Power BI
is described in the evidence as a third-party platform that aggregates data from
TCNAdmin and is used to estimate breakage.
The platform provides extracts
showing data from various sales
244 Indi’s primary submission is
that, while the connection between Power BI extracts and ‘supporting
information’
under clauses 7.2, 7.4 and 7.11 may be less direct, the
extracts nonetheless fall within clause 7.16(a) as material that would permit
review of the FP Notices.
245 InComm responds that
Card Compliant reports were not based on Power BI extracts and that the SSA does
not require provision of
Power BI data.
evidence establishes that Card Compliant reports are based on Source Data from
TCNAdmin, not on Power BI extracts. Power BI
is an additional tool used by TCN
to analyse data and estimate breakage, but it is not part of the chain of
calculations required
under clause 7.
247 However,
Power BI extracts may, nonetheless, be relevant as ‘supporting
information’ in a broader sense. If Power
BI was used by InComm/TCN to
check Card Compliant calculations or to inform decisions about how to instruct
Card Compliant, then
Power BI materials could shed light on the calculation
248 The difficulty is that Indi has not
clearly articulated what specific purpose the Power BI extracts would serve in
reviewing the
FP Notices. The request appears somewhat speculative —
seeking the material to see whether it might reveal relevant information,
than identifying a specific gap in the information already required to be
249 Moreover, Mr Mould provided Power BI
extracts to Mr Hewitt in October 2023, and further Power BI extracts were
provided in February
2025. Indi now seeks ‘current versions’ of the
earlier extracts, but has not explained what additional information current
versions would provide beyond what has already been
250 On balance, I find that Indi has not
established that Power BI extracts constitute information it is entitled to
under clauses
7.2, 7.4, 7.11 or 7.16. The extracts are not part of the
calculation chain required under clause 7, and Indi has not demonstrated
they are reasonably required for review purposes given the other information to
which it is entitled.
251 If, after receiving the
Source Data, Card Compliant reports and other materials to which it is entitled,
Indi identifies a specific
deficiency that Power BI extracts would address, it
may make a further targeted request explaining why those extracts are required.
However, at this stage, a general request for Power BI extracts is not
sustainable.
252 I therefore decline to order
provision of Power BI extracts.
E. CONCLUSION
253 For the reasons set out above, I find
(a) Indi is entitled to
Source Data from TCNAdmin, the Breakage Brief, any communications between InComm
and Card Compliant relating
to the Card Compliant reports and documents relied
on to prepare the FP Notices pursuant to clauses 7.2, 7.4 and
(b) Indi is entitled to general ledgers and a
reasonable sample of underlying invoices and transactional records relating to
the calculation
of December 22 EBITDA (Base) pursuant to clause
(c) InComm has not provided the Card Compliant
reports required under clauses 7.2(a), 7.4(a) and 7.11(a)(i) and Indi is
entitled to
such reports;
(d) Indi is entitled to
the Source Data, the Breakage Brief, Card Compliant reports and related
materials, and documents relied on
to prepare the FP Notices under clause
7.16(a) as an alternative basis;
(e) Indi is
entitled to the categories of documents requested by Mr Carruth pursuant to
clause 7.16(b) (other than Item 5, which is
no longer sought), subject to
reasonable limits on the scope of sampling of transactional records as set out
(f) Indi is not entitled to Power BI
254 The parties are required to confer
and, within fourteen days:
(a) submit a proposed form of
order to give effect to these reasons, including as to costs;
(b) failing agreement, file and serve submissions
of no more than 3 pages addressing these matters and attaching their preferred

Patti v Belfiore

(1958) 100 CLR 198
High Court considered the meaning of ‘refuse’ as used in a contract.
While no reference was made to a relevant ‘presumption’
‘assumption’, Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Taylor JJ held that, having
regard to the language of the clause and the general
framework of the agreement
in which it was located, there was no reason for supposing that the word
‘refuse’ in one clause
should receive any different interpretation
in another clause.
