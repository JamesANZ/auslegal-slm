Daley, Simon; Gouliaditis, Nick --- "The Hardiman Principle" [2010] AdminRw 11; (2010) 59 Admin Review 60
The Hardiman principle
Gouliaditis
principle concerns the degree to which certain
administrative decision makers can act as contradictors in proceedings
challenging
their decisions. In
itself the High Court had
unanimously taken issue with the role played by the Australian Broadcasting
Tribunal in proceedings in which
prerogative writs were being sought against the
tribunal. The court said:
In cases of this kind the usual course is for a tribunal to submit to such order
as the court may make. The course which was adopted
by the Tribunal in this
court is not one which we wish to encourage. If a tribunal becomes a protagonist
in this court there is the
risk that by so doing it endangers the impartiality
which it is expected to maintain in subsequent proceedings which take place if
and when relief is granted. The presentation of a case in this court by a
tribunal should be regarded as exceptional and, where it
occurs, should in
general, be limited to submissions going to the powers and procedures of the

Council to consider them.
First, although
concerned the operation of a
‘tribunal’ exercising adjudicatory functions
—that is, tribunals in the nature of court substitutes—it
has been observed that the basis of the principle (a concern
to maintain the
appearance of impartiality) extends to other administrators to whom a matter
might be remitted following judicial
There are cases that
should be applied in all cases in which the following
• The decision maker is required to accord procedural fairness.
• The application for relief raises the prospect of remitter to the
decision maker.
• Either there is present a contradictor prepared to advance arguments in
opposition to the applicant’s claim for relief
or, when there is no
contradictor, there is a public interest that would justify the intervention of
the Attorney-General (or other
law officer or public
Only if there is no
natural contradictor, and there is no intervention, is an active role justified,
and even then it should be limited
to what is necessary to assist the

of the Federal Court has held that

the Administrative Appeals
The Victorian Court of
Appeal has, however, encouraged decision makers to take an active role in
Administrative Tribunal come to the
‘correct or preferable’ decision by defending the decision under
The Court of Appeal noted
that the original decision maker, as repository of the powers and
responsibilities conferred on it by the
legislative scheme under which it made
the relevant decision, has the experience and knowledge to make a unique
contribution and
that the presence of other contradictors was ‘no
guarantee that all relevant matters will be canvassed’. Given that the
Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal rarely remitted matters, it was
unlikely that the impartiality of the original decision
maker would be
jeopardised by active participation, so long as it did not ‘engage in
curial tactics’.
Third, in an apparent further extension of
, the rule was
recently applied to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in
judicial review proceedings in which it
sought to defend not its own decision
but a decision made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (on review from the
Australian Securities
and Investments Commission). The Full Court of the Federal
Court noted that, had the appeal been successful, there would be the possibility
of the matter being referred back to the AAT. Further, they reasoned that,
pursuant to
Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975
… it is open to the [AAT], in reviewing a decision, to remit the matter to
the original decision-maker for further consideration.
Thus it was at least
theoretically possible that the [AAT] would remit this matter to [ASIC] for
further consideration … We
consider that the view of the High Court as
expressed in
should have informed [ASIC] in deciding upon the
role which it would play in these proceedings, both in the [AAT] and on appeal

of administrative law would recognise that there is currently a major disconnect
between these significant extensions
principle and the
actual role decision makers play in many areas of administrative law litigation.
The field of migration law is an
example. If the cases just discussed are
accepted as the proper scope of the rule, there is a real question about the
by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in defending
decisions of the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal.
There is also a real question about the minister’s role in defending his
own decisions.
A more fundamental question is whether the
principle is
appropriate in any case. Arguably, decision makers are often best placed to make
submissions on their jurisdiction and
It might also be
incongruous that in cases raising questions of public law the only parties that
should be allowed to take an active
role are those more concerned with their
narrow commercial interests than the broader public
Even if there is a role for such a principle there is a question as to
whether applying
in the broad manner suggested by some cases
fails to differentiate sufficiently between court-like tribunals, which must
an impartial and dignified stance, and ‘administrative tribunals
charged with the development and implementation of policies
under a very broad
statutory framework’.
No doubt that is why in cases where the private parties will not adequately
‘expose all aspects of the case’ the authorities
say it is desirable
for the Attorney-General to intervene as an
Whether it would be a
satisfactory solution to identify a surrogate contradictor such as the
Attorney-General or the Commonwealth
to intervene in every case in which a
primary decision maker is constrained might also be worthy of further
consideration.
