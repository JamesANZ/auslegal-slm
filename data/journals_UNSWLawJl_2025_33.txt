BURDENING THE IMPLIED FREEDOM OF POLITICAL COMMUNICATION:
METHOD, IDEAS, AND DISAGREEMENT
PATRICK GRAHAM*
This article explores what is driving the many divided decisions reached
over recent years by the High Court in implied freedom of
communication cases. Key to that divergence is the remarkable range of
approaches taken to the assessment of not only the
extent of a particular
statutory burden on constitutionally protected political speech but also
concerning what types of legislative
restriction constitute any such burden in
the first place. This article argues that competing ideas on the High Court
Bench about
the core function of the doctrine are producing starkly different
interpretive approaches and outcomes in implied freedom challenges.
having first located the doctrine’s roots within a framework of Australian
constitutional ‘legalism’ that
reflects the primacy of political
checks on government power, this article endorses an interpretive model that
takes a maximalist
view of the impact and importance of strands of political
speech on electoral choice.
I INTRODUCTION
Observing that the Court has divided in opinion about the outcome of
particular [implied freedom of political communication] cases
shows no more than
that the questions at issue call for judgment, and that opinions may differ
to them in a particular case.
– Justice Michelle Gordon,
McCloy v New South Wales
The High Court now routinely reaches split decisions in constitutionally
implied freedom of political communication (‘implied
cases. A key driver of that divergence is the wide range of approaches applied
to the assessment of not only the
of a statutory burden on
political communication, but also in answering the question of what
of legislative restriction placed on electorally relevant speech may constitute
a burden in the very first place. I argue in this
article that these doctrinal
tensions are rooted in competing ideas about the essence of constitutionally
protected political communication.
Further, I make the case that the legalistic
foundations of the implied freedom offer, somewhat paradoxically, legitimation

political speech than that which has prevailed in recent
years on the High
Analysis of the now ossified doctrinal rift on the High Court Bench over the
benefits of proportionality testing as compared to calibrated
scrutiny when
reviewing the constitutionality of a statutory
has eclipsed important
normative choices that must be made
to the application of either of
those two tests. The assessment of the nature of a legal burden on political
speech is undertaken
separately at a preliminary stage of the now-modified test

to the evaluation of whether that impediment is
reasonably appropriate and

It is ‘[a]nalytically
important’ at the beginning of the validity testing process ‘to be
categorical about the
nature of the burden ... impose[d] on political

Differing views on the High Court Bench about the core function of the
implied freedom are driving starkly divergent interpretive
approaches and
outcomes in constitutional challenges to legislative power. The implied freedom
operates ultimately to protect and
foster political modes of accountability over
government power.
It does so by
securing the flow of information critical to the integrity of voter

constitutionally implied limit is placed on statutory power so that a law cannot

relevant communication. Significant and
recurrent disparities of view on the High Court about the relative
of a particular act of speech in fulfilling that core constitutional
function have shaped materially different outcomes in the assessment
gravity of an impugned law’s burden on the implied freedom. This
ultimately reflects very different positions on what
it takes to
political communication in a sense that fulfils the constitutional imperatives
protected by the implied freedom doctrine.
Put differently, a view of the quality and importance of political speech
necessary to sustain Australia’s constitutionally
prescribed system of
government must precede the qualitative assessment of the extent to which
communication is burdened by an impugned
law. Where a broad construction is
taken of the importance and influence of a particular form of speech in shaping
public discourse
relevant to voter choice, a statutory impediment to that mode
of communication will invariably be assessed as more extensive than
narrower view of its reach was adopted.
Disparities in the High Court’s analytical approach to those questions
are more evident in the most recent implied freedom judgments
than is true at
any point in the post-
jurisprudence. That disparity may also
explain why outcomes remained largely the same in decisions taken in, and

some cases, equally divisive question or ‘threshold
of whether a
purported statutory burden is, in fact,
kind of tangible impediment
to political communication: here, again, the High Court’s justices have
often adopted sharply divergent
interpretive approaches. The threshold question
is, I argue, marked by the adoption of conflicting ‘positivist’ and
approaches, with that split attributable to whether one
insists that an identifiable legal

constitutional protection. Evaluation
of the gravity of a statutory burden, by
contrast, is shaped by the relative importance attached to a constitutionally

principles relevant to the identification and evaluation
of a statutory burden
on political speech: this includes analysis of the positivist and systemic
approaches adopted to the antecedent

In Part III, I consider the diverse ways in which High Court justices have
assessed the nature of legislative burdens on political
communication in recent
cases. I find that stark divergence in interpretive methods reflect a diversity
of opinion about the
of protection that must be afforded to a
particular form of speech in order to preserve the constitutional imperatives
underpinning
the implied freedom. I also touch on divergence in the application
of the Court’s ‘prudential’ approach to constitutional
disputes, which is a further driver of doctrinal instability in implied freedom
challenges.
In Part IV, I ask what the doctrine’s origins tell us about its
apposite range of operation. Locating the implied freedom’s
basis within a
framework of Australian ‘legalistic’ constitutional orthodoxy that
reflects the primacy of political checks
on government power, I sketch and
endorse an interpretive model that takes a maximalist view of the impact and
importance of strands
of political speech on electoral choice. Such a model was
crystallised, I argue, in the High Court’s unanimous reasoning in
foundational
decision: there, a model of governance was traced
necessitating a richer view than has been evident on the apex court in recent
of the significance of speech bearing on electoral choice. Further
instructive in this regard, and explored in this section, is recent
taken by state courts and the Federal Court in implied freedom challenges: the
decisions explored offer useful direction
for how statutory burdens can be
evaluated by the apex court in a manner that more closely aligns with the
doctrinal foundations

by construing a purported burden in a

and creeping legislative intrusions’,
so that, ultimately, a point is
reached where ‘there are so few avenues of communication left that the

also been deemed necessary to ensure that minority voices are not made

such, the implied freedom can provide legislative immunity only from
constitutionally unjustifiable burdens placed on
communication
relating to political and governmental matters. That doctrinal axiom again
accords with the implied freedom’s
constitutional basis: it acts as a
direct constraint on legislative power at the systemic, and not the personal,
level. The High
Court, Edelman J wrote in
Farm Transparency
consistently denied that the freedom implied in the
Constitution
limit on legislative power, prevents a Parliament from regulating communications
that a person is
free to make. To recognise otherwise would
transmogrify the constitutional protection of a freedom into a constitutional
claim right.
It is in this sense, then, that a legal burden must be justified only to the
extent that it has an
incremental
effect on political speech that goes
beyond a valid, pre-existing restraint on conduct produced by the common law,
equity or statute.
which an incremental statutory burden is measured is also vitally important: if
drawn narrowly, the degree of justification
required to justify the impediment
on political speech diminishes accordingly. This, as we will see, was the
central analytical tension

What I label the ‘systemic’ approach, by contrast, does not
require a link between an affected form of political communication

of an impugned law is assessed according to
how it affects the
operation of
political communication. This more expansive approach means
that it is not only positively identifiable legal privileges to communicate
electorally relevant matters that may be burdened, but
communicative activity that, in any respect, bears on the integrity of voting

be classed as a statutory

And, as James
Stellios writes, ‘[t]he pre-existing legal norms must themselves be

The approach of the dissenting justices in
in holding that the
impugned provisions impermissibly burden the implied freedom reflects, albeit in
two different forms, a ‘systemic’
conception of the implied freedom.

considerable extent’, burdened political communication
as they had the
capacity to

their effect, they are apt to restrict or distort the choice presented to an

D Identifying a Statutory Burden and Constitutional
Imperatives
, Gageler J wrote that the implied freedom cannot be confined
to protect only those forms of political speech rooted in a legally
enforceable
authority as to do so would detach the implication from its constitutional
function in preserving electoral
accountability.
Application of
what I have labelled the ‘systemic’ approach allows us to take an
expansive view of the political communication
necessary to secure a true
electoral vote. It means that the ‘real-world impact on the making and
receipt of communications

measured when evaluating the practical burdening effect of an impugned
Proponents of the positivist view stress the constitutional imperatives

doctrine can protect
only those forms of political speech that a person has an anterior, legally
enforceable right to perform: to
hold otherwise, positivists argue, is to
indulge in the constitutional solecism that the implication can

that happens, the positivist approach established in

rationale. This encompasses the constitutional
protectability of all
politically relevant speech not rooted in statutory
authority: recognition of that category of protectable speech does not create
enforceable right, but, rather, admits the practical reality and importance of
an Australian political discourse that is fluid
and diverse. Ultimately, the
positivist approach sets an artificial distinction between protectable and
non-protectable forms of
communication: the focus of the evaluation process
should instead be directed to the adequacy of the justification tendered for
obstacles in the way of any lawful mode of political communication.
III EVALUATING A BURDEN: INTRICACY AND DISAGREEMENT IN
RECENT HIGH COURT DECISIONS
A Different Starting Points
, Gageler J wrote that the effect of a law on political
communication is
gauged by nothing more complicated than comparing: the practical ability of a
person or persons to engage in political communication
the law; and
the practical ability of that same person or those same persons to engage in
political communication
Despite the avowed simplicity of the interpretive task, there is no settled
methodology for testing the gravity of a legislative burden
on the implied
freedom and it may be that no such standard or design is possible. But it is
clear from High Court jurisprudence that,
when gauging the extent of a statutory
burden, the judicial task extends beyond a comparative analysis outlined by
Gageler J in
and encompasses the relative importance of the impeded
mode of political communication. It is also the case that recent variance across
the High Court Bench in the assessment of statutory burdens is having a material
impact on the evolution of implied freedom doctrine.
Where a statutory burden is
deemed insubstantial, the corresponding depth of justification required for its
enactment is necessarily
reduced compared to a legal burden on political speech
assessed as significant. And with a restrictive view of the nature of
protectable
communication prevailing on the High Court Bench in recent years
– an outlook rooted in the assessment of the importance of
a particular
form of political speech – the implied freedom’s capacity to check
legislative power has weakened.
This section looks at what is driving the remarkable disparity in the
assessment of burdens on the implied freedom in recent years.
It does so by
focusing closely on several decisions of the Kiefel High Court (2017–23).
The discussion is lengthy not only
because of the Bench’s practice in that
period of issuing multiple reasons in individual cases, but also due to the
and diversity of methodological approach evident across those
individual judgments.
I find that the key driver behind the remarkable variation in assessments of
individual statutory burdens is the range of views on
the High Court over what
is necessary to
political communication to the extent required by
the constitutional imperatives underpinning the implied freedom. Those
imperatives
centre on the preservation of informed electoral choice as a check
on government power. It is important to be clear that the question
degree of constitutional protection must be given to particular forms of speech
in order to maintain the integrity of electoral
choice is conceptually distinct
from the question ‘what is
political communication?’: the
latter being primarily a categorial analysis and one the High Court has

answered in broad
By contrast, evaluation
of the nature of a legal burden requires a constructional choice about the
impact and significance of the
relevant strand of constitutionally protected
political communication in shaping discourse bearing on electoral choice. The
of a statutory burden’s character is thereby attuned so that the
importance of a form of communication over voter behaviour
dictates the gravity
of that legal impediment placed on political speech.
The significance of a particular mode of political communication depends on
application of the same principles used to assess the
‘political’ in implied freedom doctrine: that is, those
communications ‘necessary for the effective
operation of the system of
representative and responsible
government’.

appeal judgment, Edelman J began his reasons with a call
for ‘[c]larity and principle’ in implied freedom reasoning. His
Honour’s focus was on the perceived danger that the doctrine may become
‘an unlicensed vehicle’ for the judiciary
to undermine the
democratic process.
‘[W]ithout a reasoning process requiring precision of thought and
expression’, Edelman J warned (while drawing on the
poetry of Alfred
Tennyson) of the emergence of a ‘codeless myriad of precedent, [t]hat
wilderness of single
instances’.
While his Honour’s warning concerned the perceived advantages of
structured proportionality testing as an analytical device
in implied freedom
the most pressing
limitations and systemic risks of inconsistent interpretive approaches may lie
elsewhere. First, there is scant
evidence that the resolve of Gageler CJ and
Gordon J not to adopt structured proportionality testing at the justificatory
implied freedom challenges has catalysed different outcomes on the
question of validity in individual
Rather, it is in the
assessment of the nature of a statutory burden that the High Court is not only
often profoundly divided over,
but has also yet to establish a clear and settled
methodological approach to steer that process.
Secondly, but closely related, given the limited review capacity afforded to
the courts by the implied freedom limitation, the more
pressing danger to the
democratic process is less likely to be judicial overreach in the assessment of
the constitutional validity
of a statutory provision, but, instead, the
inadequate appreciation of the extent of a particular legal burden placed on
communication. If the recognition of the influence of specific forms
of speech on electoral choice is understated, then a statutory
burden cannot be

that I have argued must be made about the nature, and relative
importance, of
political communication required to protect and sustain constitutional
government across Australia. While Gageler

from the distinctive interpretive approaches taken to the statutory powers that

impugned provisions only insofar as they function to affect those complicit in a

and Keane J once again in effect downplayed the
electoral significance on the
legal prohibition of a particular form of political information entering public
discourse. The statutory
burden was also assessed as modest as it concerned only
a small range of political communication. On that reading, then, the statutory
burden is quite small because it concerns the transmission of speech peripheral
to the shaping of voting preferences. The significance
of that categorisation is
seen most clearly in the final stage of proportionality testing – adequacy
of balance (or ‘strict
proportionality’) – where Kiefel CJ and
Keane J held that the policy goal underpinning the impugned provisions was not
manifestly outweighed by a burden of such
insignificance.

IV A ‘CODELESS MYRIAD OF PRECEDENT’? IN SEARCH
OF METHODOLOGIAL CONSISTENCY
I turn now to developing the basis of an interpretive framework derived from
the implied freedom’s legalistic foundations –
established in
– which, in my view, shows that the narrower interpretive
path predominating in the cases explored in
when assessing the extent
of a statutory burden may not fully reflect the tenets of Australian
constitutional orthodoxy that, in
my view, necessitate the doctrine as a
limitation on legislative power. Moreover, recent decisions beyond the High
Court indicate
how such a richer conception of constitutionally protectable
speech can operate.

tells us that implied freedom doctrine must be calibrated to
protect not only the multiplicity of forms of politically relevant speech

in the broadest sense the constitutional significance,

cultivating the free and informed
electoral choice that ultimately makes
political accountability possible must influence the measurement of the extent
of a burden
placed on electorally relevant communication.
I note, however, that the broad conception of the constitutional significance
of forms of protected speech advocated here did not
enjoy majority support of
the High Court Bench during the Kiefel Court. Too often, as I explored in
, the relative significance of a particular form of speech in shaping
electoral choice was understated, resulting in a diminishment
of the gravity of
an impugned law as a burden on political communication. But this enhanced view
of what it means to burden political

fundamentals also shaped an exceptionally thorough evaluation of
a statutory burden in the New South Wales Supreme Court’s decision
Kvelde v New South Wales
In respect of the implied freedom, the case concerned a challenge brought by
environmental activists, the ‘Knitting Nannies’,
who felt deterred
from engaging in protests after the enactment of New South Wales legislation
limiting conduct at ‘major facilities’
(defined as a transportation
hub, certain ports and core infrastructure services such as water and
in the State.
Crimes Act 1900
(NSW) prohibited conduct resulting in
the closure of such a facility or a part of it, while
section 214A(1)(d)
unlawful to cause a person attempting to use a major facility to be
redirected.
In assessing the nature of the impugned provisions’ burden on political
speech, Walton J stated at the outset that protest on
green issues of the nature

are committed to and regularly participate in is
a type of political communication ‘on which the efficacy of electoral
accountability

constitutionally proscribed [sic] national system of representative
responsible government
Honour noted that one important aspect of the statutory burden is that it fell
on a ‘prototypical peaceful protest
insofar as it affected assemblies near a major facility – and one that has
an intrinsically
‘communicative
The incremental burden, Walton J held, was similar to that in
and had to be assessed according to the ‘the real world ability of a
person or persons to have others receive communications
which are capable of
bearing on electoral
The burden on
political communication was ultimately found to be ‘direct and
substantial’;

‘substantial deterrent or chilling effect’ on political

section 214A(1)(c)
was constitutionally invalid to the extent that
it operates on the closure of a major facility, while
section 214A(1)(d)
an impermissible burden on the implied freedom in its entire operation.
A similar analytical approach is also evident in the New South Wales Court of
Appeal’s decision two years ago in
Burton v DPP (NSW)
where, again, the essence of the
vision of the implied
freedom’s protective purpose
informed Kirk JA’s (with whom
Bell CJ and Leeming JA agreed) analysis of the burden placed on political
communication. The case
concerned an implied freedom challenge to the validity
of a state law that prohibits reporting on the name of a child involved in
proceedings.
Kirk JA stated that, from
, we know that the implied freedom

In assessing the extent of the burden, it was important, Kirk JA wrote, to

fundamentals ensures, ultimately, that the protective reach of
the implied freedom is more precisely attuned to the object that the
serves in the protection of strands of political accountability over government
V CONCLUSION
The implied freedom of political communication is embedded in the Australian
constitutional order. And yet, despite those firm roots,
in practice it often
operates with a large degree of instability traceable to contested ideas over
the very nature of political communication,
which, in turn, shape very different
assessments of the extent of individual statutory burdens. Gordon J’s
, reproduced at the beginning of this article, may seek
to allay fears over problems associated with divergent outcomes in implied
freedom cases. But, as we have seen, it should be a real point of concern that,
, persistent and fundamental disagreements over the
fulfilment of the
fundamentals underpinning the implied freedom
often produce deep splits in the Court’s view of the proper constitutional
of legislative power.
Almost two decades ago, Stellios wrote that a possible explanation for the
implied freedom’s ‘unsettled’ nature
at that time was the High
Court’s mission to ‘incrementally [feel] its way forward with a
fledgling constitutional
been applied for over 30 years, the doctrine may lack the same operational
pedigree relative to other core constitutional
implications, but its form has,
particularly since
, had plenty of space to coalesce through a broad
range of cases heard across the Australian court system.
Many lingering points of doctrinal tension may instead more closely reflect
Stellios’s second mooted explanation for the doctrine’s
unsettledness. That is, an unease among some justices that, in applying the
implied freedom, ‘the judiciary is operating
at the margin of, or in fact
overreaching, its legitimate constitutional
explain, for example, the continued insistence on positive legal rights before
the implied freedom can be applied, as well
as the more recent narrowing of the
test applied at the ‘necessity’ step of proportionality testing.
Those questions of legitimacy concerning the supervision of the systemic
effect of a legislative burden on electorally relevant speech
may abate, I
suggest, if we look to the constitutional tenets that create Australia’s
governmental practices as explored in
and how the exercise of public
power is modulated. Understood in that sense, what is equally concerning is the
more recent interpretive
trend at the first stage of validity testing under the
framework of understating the importance of forms of communication
that concern the electoral process, and not least in the formation
choice. The deep significance of
is that, even as the implied
freedom’s constitutional basis was narrowed by the High Court, the
courts’ active supervisory role over risks to the integrity of
electoral choice remained not only manifest but substantial.
This is the
‘structural imperative’ from which the implication is derived and
which, ultimately, frames the analysis
of whether a burden unduly weakens
democratic choice.
doctrine’s legalistic foundations demand, somewhat paradoxically,
proactive judicial protection from systemic threats stemming
from legislative
enactments. At the more granular level, then, as electoral choice is the
keystone of the regulation of government
power in the Australian constitutional
order, conduct relevant to the performance of the act of voting must be
understood as both
capable of having a multifaceted and
decisive bearing on electoral practices. As such, the protective reach of the
doctrine can and
be calibrated to identify, and require robust
justification for, a much broader range of legislative impediments to the
of Australian political discourse than the High Court has recently been
prepared to recognise.

Central to that debate
was Adrienne Stone’s argument that the depth of constitutional protection
afforded to political communication
must depend on the incorporation of
extra-constitutional values and ideas as, at root, the limitation on power
requires a balancing
of competing interests: Stone, ‘Limits of
Constitutional Text and Structure’ (n 210) 671–2, 702–5. See

of Dawson J and McHugh J in

‘representation-reinforcement’, which charted a path for strong
review of government interference on participatory rights in the
democratic process, has also been identified as reflected in the
development of
implied freedom doctrine: see, eg, Stephen Gageler, ‘Implied Rights’
in Michael Coper and George Williams
The Cauldron of Constitutional
(Centre for International and Public Law, 1997) 83; Lim (n 202)

As the implication is
not an absolute limitation, calibrating the
of protection afforded
to a burdened form of communication is also vital, but is a complex question
outside the scope of this article.

lawyers to make political points in advertisements so long as that communication
not reference the impugned law’s prohibited subjects concerning
