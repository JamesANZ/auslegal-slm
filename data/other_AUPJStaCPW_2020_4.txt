2. Australian Securities & Investments
Commission Proposed Fit Out of New Leased Premises at 100 Market Street,
2.1 The Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) seeks
approval from the Committee to proceed with the proposed fit
out of new leased
premises at 100 Market Street, Sydney NSW. The aim of the project is to align
ASIC’s Sydney office with the
standard Activity Based Working (ABW) fit
out model, and facilitate an increase in Sydney staff numbers following the $404
in additional funding provided to implement the recommendations from the
Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking Superannuation
and Financial
Services Industry (Banking Royal
Commission).
2.2 The estimated cost of the project is $29.8 million (excluding GST).
2.3 The project was referred to the Committee on 27 November 2019.
Conduct of the
2.4 Following referral, the inquiry was publicised on the Committee’s
website and via media release.
2.5 The Committee received one submission, one supplementary submission and
one confidential submission. A list of submissions can
be found at Appendix
2.6 On 14 February 2020, the Committee conducted a project briefing, public
and in-camera hearing in Sydney, New South Wales. A transcript
of the public
hearing is available on the Committee’s website.
Need for the works
2.7 ASIC is Australia's integrated corporate, markets, financial services and
consumer credit regulator. As an independent Commonwealth
Government body, ASIC
administers the
Australian Securities and Investments
Commission Act
(ASIC Act) and carries out most of its work under the
Corporations
(Corporations
2.8 It is the role of ASIC under the
to maintain, facilitate
and improve the performance of the financial system, administer the law
effectively, and enforce and give
effect to the
In their submission to the
committee, ASIC stated that:
Following the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation
and Financial Services Industry and the announcement
in March 2019 of $404m
increase in ASIC’s funding, ASIC’s property portfolio has been
placed under immediate increased
pressure in all offices, including
Sydney office is currently located at 100 Market Street and accommodates 1,078
staff in 1,062 traditional workpoints
over 18,475 meters
However, as a result of
the increase in funding from the Royal Commission, ASIC estimates Sydney staff
numbers will increase to approximately
1,350 from July
2.10 In planning for the expiry of the current lease on 31
2020 at 100 Market Street Sydney, and the estimated staff increase, ASIC told
the Committee that it ‘sought expressions
of interest from the market in
January 2018 to establish whether there might be more suitable accommodation to
meet future needs.’
ASIC stated that:
...as a result of that process, ASIC identified the existing 100 Market Street
premises as providing the best value for money lease
option, given the financial
offering of a below market rent and strong landlord incentive, its location and
accessibility to stakeholders
and available amenity for
told the Committee that:
To ensure ASIC’s Sydney office can accommodate required staff numbers in a
flexible and efficient manner, a full office fit
out project is proposed. The
current fit out has reached the end of its usable life and does not meet the
Commonwealth’s density
requirements. It also does not encourage or enable
more modern ways of working where workplace settings better support the
staff are undertaking, respond to and incorporate new technology and
support great collaboration and increased
innovation.
addition, ASIC stated in their submission that as a result of a national
consultation process in 2014, ‘ASIC has developed
its own Activity Based
Working (ABW) model...[that] will improve the workplace density from 16.3 square
meters per workpoint in the
current fit out to 11.6 square
2.13 At the public hearing Ms Dixon told the Committee that:
[ASIC’s] standard ABW fit out is based on ASICs specific operational
requirements and work practices and will position ASIC
for the future, allowing
us to attract and retain staff and be flexible with growth requirements...
ASIC’s ABW fit out has
already been delivered in Adelaide, Hobart, and
Perth offices, and is currently being implemented in
Options considered
2.14 In their submission, ASIC noted that:
...an Evaluation Committee (EC) was established to consider, in detail final
submissions and a methodology was designed to objectively
assess the best option
on a value for money basis. The EC assessed the Expression of Interest’s
short-listed seven buildings
and requested Final
on the responses received, ASIC had three options to consider:
a. Remain at 100 Market Street with a new 10-year lease;
b. Remain at 100 Market Street and exercise the 5-year option on the current
c. Relocate to a new
2.16 ASIC explained that it assessed and considered the option to remain at
100 Market Street with a new 10-year lease and a reduced
Net Lettable Area
footprint as the preferred
2.17 ASIC determined that Option 2 - to remain at 100 Market Street and
exercise the 5- year option on the current lease should be
discounted as it only
allowed for ASIC to reduce their tenancy by one floor and would not achieve the
required savings across the
life of the
2.18 ASIC discounted Option 3 - to relocate to a new premise as Colliers
International identified that a key risk was the timing that
the new premises
would need to be completed and ASIC fully relocated by the 1st April
Scope of the works
2.19 The proposed ASIC fit out will be over part levels 5 and 6, and levels
7-10 at 100 Market Street, Sydney, and includes:
a. Supplementary air-conditioning in rooms with higher than normal cooling
and ventilation requirements
b. Lighting control system to reduce energy consumption in tenant areas
including the ability to automatically turn off lights in
unoccupied rooms and
to provide reduced lighting levels when appropriate
c. Data cabling throughout the tenant areas including data outlets at each
work point (designed to cater for future requirements)
d. Tenant fit out works to conform to ASIC’s operational requirements
including security (including door hardware and electronic
access control at
entrances and internal areas with higher than normal security needs)
e. Supplementation of the base building fire services where required
f. Office accommodation to meet ASIC’s Standard ABW (ASA) model,
including a general office fit out, open plan work areas, breakout
spaces, quiet
rooms and casual meeting spaces
g. Shared amenities, including kitchen hub areas, storage facilities, first
aid room, multi-use room and individually assigned lockers
h. A robust security system that protects ASIC information, people, assets
and operations, including secure areas to Zone 2 with card
readers on exit and
Zone 4, conforming with ASIO Technical
requirements
Staff consultation
2.20 At the public hearing ASIC told the Committee that in preparation for
the proposed works, it had consulted extensively with staff
in most offices over
the past 5 years to ensure consistency and ensure it had a good understanding of
what activities staff were
undertaking, what type of work environment and
technology was required to enable to staff to complete their work
effectively.
2.21 ASIC stated that ‘specialist and key stakeholder teams in Sydney
have been consulted to determine specific requirements
for areas such as the
Commission, Evidence Services, the Information Resource Centre, and
2.22 In addition, ASIC noted in their submission that ‘a Sydney
Stakeholder team has been established including local representatives
team, as a communication point for staff on the ABW implementation, to consider
and develop etiquettes for the space, and
assist with the change
2.23 ASIC stated that an intranet page has been established to provide staff
with updates ‘on ABW projects in their office,
including Sydney’.
ASIC noted that ‘regular all-staff emails and updates are posted to ensure
staff are kept abreast
of the project progress.’
2.24 At the public hearing the Committee asked ASIC what feedback had been
received by staff in other sites where ASIC’s ABW
model had been
established. ASIC told the Committee that the positive feedback focused largely
on the flexibility that the new workspace
provided and praised the technological
support provided by ASIC to support team based work. ASIC noted that some of the
project and the difficulties some staff were having adapting to
the new work
environment.
consultation
2.25 ASIC stated that ‘construction of the fit out will impact
positively on the local economy with employment in the private
ASIC estimate that during construction, ‘on average it is anticipated
there will be 50 people employed on site
for the 12-month period, with up to 100
people employed off-site during peak periods. It is estimated that up to 300
people will
work on various stages of the project through the design and
construction.’
2.26 At the public hearing the Committee asked ASIC about the impact of the
project on its current sublease with the Future Fund.
ASIC stated that:
When we went to the market we did a joint approach to market with the Future
Fund and Treasury as part of the Commonwealth's approach
to how they manage
property now. We've consulted with the Future Fund. The Future Fund will also
have their own separate tenancy
in 100 Market Street. Our meeting space on level
5 gets used by a number of Commonwealth agencies, and they will ensure that in
fit-out as well. We will have arrangements with them if they wish to use
our meeting rooms as well, in the public spaces, and get
better use out of
Cost of the works
2.27 Australian Securities & Investments Commission Proposed Fit out of
New Leased Premises at 100 Market Street, Sydney has an
estimated cost of $29.8
million, exclusive of GST.
2.28 ASIC provided further details on project costings in its confidential
submission and during an in-camera hearing.
2.29 The Committee is satisfied that the costings for the project provided to
it have been adequately assessed by the proponent entity.
2.30 The Committee was pleased to hear that the fit out will be fully funded
through ASIC’s Departmental Capital Works Budget
allocation, which will be
fully funded via the new lease incentive of approximately $34.4
2.31 ASIC stated in their submission that ‘the operating cost benefits
from the new fit out, through the increase flexibility
and utilisation of net
lettable area, and the reduction of costs of maintenance of the aging fit out
will also contribute to the
overall cost
2.32 There is no direct revenue from this project.
Committee comment
2.33 The Committee recognises the effort made by ASIC to engage with staff
and reiterates that changes to working environments need
to be carefully
undertaken to ensure minimal impact to staff. The Committee encourages ASIC to
continue to seek feedback from staff
and to ensure that staff remain informed
and engaged throughout the transition to the new working environment.
2.34 The Committee recognises the Australian Government’s Office
occupancy target of 14 meters square of usable office area
per occupied
work-point and notes that ASIC is proposing a target of 11.6 meters squared for
this project, a reduction of 4.7 meters
squared on the current fit
The Committee encourages
ASIC to ensure that the final design provides staff with adequate space and
amenities in which to comfortably
conduct their work.
2.35 The Committee is concerned that ASIC considers the current fit out at
100 Market Street as having reached its end-of-life whilst
only being 10 years
The Committee encourages
ASIC to reutilise as many elements of the current fit out as practically
feasible and to consider a longer
life span in the design for the proposed fit
2.36 Having regard to its role and responsibilities contained in the
Works Committee Act 1969
, the Committee is of the view that this project
signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project which
fit for purpose, having regard to the established need.
