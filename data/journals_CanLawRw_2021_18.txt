Australia is one of the
most ancient and naturally biodiverse places on Earth. However, unfolding in
plain sight is an ecological
extinction crisis characterised by the continual
decline of Australia’s biodiversity at the genetic, species, ecological
and area levels. Although Australia is a signatory to both the
World Charter for Nature
Convention on Biological Diversity,
its implementation of environmental laws have not optimally curbed this
trend of biodiversity loss. In the face of these environmental
challenges, this
article explores the interplay of biodiversity conservation laws applying in the
ACT and the Commonwealth. This
involves an examination of whether either of the
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999

(ACT) favours more strongly the conservation
paths advanced by the
World Charter for Nature

international and domestic laws, in addition to discussion of the current
condition of
biodiversity and the achievement of biodiversity outcomes at the

conservation management. It emphasises ‘the
preservation of habitat as

The Convention
requires signatories to develop national programmes that promote both
conservation, the sustainable use of biodiversity, and the recovery of
threatened species or

Given that human activity has compounded the effects of climate change and
accelerated the rate of forced adaptation and extinction

Australia’s international treaty obligations,
it has limited the scope of

This article critically evaluates and compares the Commonwealth and ACT
approaches to biodiversity conservation with the international

Australian legal system. This is prefaced on the notion that the Commonwealth
and ACT are jointly committed to
maintaining high environmental standards, by
ensuring that Australia complies fully with all of its international
environmental obligations.
Although the scope of this research is limited to Commonwealth and ACT
legislation, it is notable that future avenues of research
could involve
comparisons to the laws of other states and territories, which are beholden to
the same commitment. This article will
compare the

by shifting focus from
‘preserving “what is, or what was there” to “what more

Thus, I strive to ensure that current legislation optimally curbs biodiversity

‘the next generation of environmental laws will need to recognise
explicitly the role of humanity

General Principles
Article 1 of the Charter provides that ‘nature shall be respected and
its essential processes shall not be impaired’.
The following articles
then propose that:
(1) The genetic viability of earth shall not be
compromised;
(2) All of nature shall be subject to principles of conservation, with
special protections given to unique areas and
(3) Nature shall be managed to maintain optimum sustainable productivity and
preserve ecosystem integrity;
(4) Nature shall be secured against degradation by means of warfare or other
activities.
These principles potentially marked a ‘“paradigm shift in
environmental law” to biocentrism’ through the creation

economic development,

For example, art 10
implores that natural resources are not to be wasted and should be used with
appropriate restraint.
Another key provision is art 11 which recommends the use of technology to

assessment of their impacts.

conservation laws adopt a ‘two-pronged

law. Then, I contend that this approach must
be accompanied by measurable
conservation objectives. Finally, the section concludes with recommendations for
the reform of Australia’s
reserve systems and listing approaches.
A An Outcomes-Driven
Approach to Statutory Objects Clauses
There is a need for clearer outcome objectives for environmental
legislation.
Outcomes-based
conditions are those which focus on achieving a specific environmental outcome,
without prescribing how that outcome
The APEEL proposes
that the setting of hard outcomes, rather than merely steps thought appropriate
to achieve them, can provide a
baseline environmental standard and
comparator.
The benefits of outcomes-oriented laws may include:
(1) the implementation of assurance frameworks that require demonstrated
progress towards specific outcomes;
(2) offering regulators a low-cost method of gaining compliance with
regulatory goals via the encouragement of innovation in environmental
strategies; and
(3) building public confidence in environmental regulation through
‘progress-tracking’ and ‘success-measuring’
mechanisms.
Laws need to be clearly defined in order to avoid strategic uncertainties
when multiple principles can pull the interpretation of
policies in different
directions.
One example is
the objective of ESD, where there is no agreement as to whether its
interpretation should be more environmentally
or economically
specificity and consistency among conservation objectives is also a challenge to
coordinating uniform conservation action.
The efficacy of objects clauses can be improved by precisely identifying the
purpose of an objects clause and drafting the clause
to articulate that purpose.
Then, the language of each object should be sufficiently specific to confine the
interpretative bounds
of that object. If there is potential that clauses may
conflict, a mechanism within the objects clause, such as a designated priority
between clauses, should resolve that conflict. Lastly, objects clauses must
influence the exercise of discretionary powers under
the statute, such as
requiring a decision-maker’s consideration of the clauses or indicating
that decisions must achieve one

B Systems of Environmental
Monitoring and Measurable Conservation Objectives
Both the Charter and the Convention recognise that the evaluation of
conservation methods are crucial processes to effective
conservation.
Thus, it is
imperative that conservation objectives are qualitatively and quantitatively

This limited
topographic availability diminishes the capacity of many species to adapt
independently. However, this context presents
an opportunity to introduce more
climate-adaptive legal frameworks that can anticipate and respond to
environmental changes.
1 Land Reservation
At the Commonwealth level, ensuring the completeness of NRS requires meeting
the terms of the
Biodiversity Convention’s
Aichi Target
One of the most important
conservation values of the NRS is the wide diversity of native ecosystems and
habitat that it provides.
This value pertains to coverage of the underlying geographic diversity of the
landscape, including the ‘soils, geology, topography
micro-climate’ which determine the distribution and variation of ecosystem
To the extent that NRS
protected areas remain representative of Australia’s biodiversity, the
effects of climate are not likely
to trigger changes in the species composition
and ecosystem types in the next 50
However, there is scope to expand the NRS network to include future climate

extension of protected area boundaries
to private land
reservations.
Enhancing the
ecological connectivity of protected areas could also be facilitated through use
of wildlife corridors and increased
restrictions on land
Where certain areas are
likely to be critical to the survival of species – being climate refugia
in the event of extreme weather
– the creation of ‘moveable
reserves’ could be a viable approach at both Commonwealth and ACT
Moveable reserves are
those which have a temporary protection status and can be altered according to
their location, in order to
address variable conservation
For example,
temporary protected areas could encompass fish recruitment or provide drought
refuges for nomadic species.
Climate-conscious selection criteria to target ecological diversity in the
expansion of reserve systems could include:
(1) Areas of habitat at risk of environmental degradation;
(2) Refuges from developmental or climatic disturbances;
(3) Areas of high connectivity between ecosystems and habitats;
(4) Areas that will reduce gaps between existing protected areas; and
(5) Areas that support co-dependent ecological
Finally, adaptive approaches to protected areas will also require active
management and funding.

interventions to restore degraded habitat, deter invasive

In these cases, there is often insufficient scientific evidence about such
species for them to be eligible for
For example, a suite
of Australian terrestrial and inland water bird species were found to be either
sensitive or exposed to the
effects of climate
However, without
listing protections, there is currently no legal mechanism at the Commonwealth
level to protect those
Thus, the benefit of
anticipatory listing is that it seeks to identify and quantify both the present
and future risks to species,
with a goal to predict and prevent future
Furthermore, the

could be improved via the
inclusion of critical habitat listing like the

Moreover, the

refugia and important ecological
Already, there are
pertinent examples in Australia of a willingness to expand habitat protection

One example is the
approach to critical habitat of the Tasmanian freshwater crayfish, which was
recently redefined from ‘all

VI Conclusion
If Australia is to remain ‘...one of the most ancient, naturally
beautiful and biodiverse places on Earth’, there is still
much work to be
Our human existence is
embedded in nature and thus we are intimately connected with the natural
environment and its
All elements of
nature bear a significant importance to humans for their intrinsic value, such
that the conservation of biodiversity
is a fundamental human
obligation.
Consequently, it
is vital that environmental laws serve to protect these unique environments and
reduce the human impacts on biodiversity.
Unfortunately, Australia’s biodiversity continues to decline. The
results of the
Biodiversity SoE 2016

that the condition of Australian biodiversity is considered poor and
problems that influence this decline include invasive species, agriculture, land
clearing and the associated impacts of
Further, there is
limited information to fully understand the impacts of pressures affecting
biodiversity due to a lack of long-term
data and environmental monitoring across
Australian jurisdictions. In order to contend with these issues, Australia needs
system of environmental laws that can respond to emergent and
continuing threats to biodiversity.
We have seen that the Australian environmental law system is overlain by the
international instruments of the
World Charter for Nature
Biodiversity Convention.
These documents establish influential codes of
conduct for the preservation of nature and have emphasised that the
consideration of
natural systems is essential to social and economic
development.
Commonwealth and territory levels, the
Conservation Act
are the principal statutes intended to give effect to these
principles of international law. However, in the course of this article,
observed that our biodiversity conservation laws have fallen short of these
international standards.
My examination of the objects clauses of both Acts found that the
Conservation Act
more closely emulated the
World Charter for
prioritisation of conservation as a paramount duty. By
contrast, the objects of the
were more akin to the
Biodiversity Convention,
which balances ecological values against other
anthropocentric values such as the social or economic importance of nature.
there were multiple objects clauses, there was further no explicit
guidance as to the relative weight to be assigned to each object.
In relation Australia’s land reservation areas, this research found
that protected area networks at the Commonwealth level were
not sufficient to
meet the criteria of Aichi Target 11 under the
Biodiversity Convention
While the total land area of protected area networks in the ACT were
proportionally higher than those at the Commonwealth level,
both regimes failed
to account for distributional shifts of migratory species and climate change
In addition, passive
management of protected areas has failed to assist conservation efforts due to a
heavy reliance on self-regulation.
The classification and listing approaches of the
Nature Conservation Act
were also observed to inadequately provide for
protection of biodiversity
When compared to the
Nature Conservation Act
uniquely provided scope for
listing of species in ‘provisional’ and ‘data deficient’
categories. However,
both Acts were hindered by insufficient funding and
resourcing of conservation efforts, bias in the selection of listed species,
biodiversity data gaps and an inability to address the cumulative impacts of
developments.
In order to optimally curb biodiversity loss and achieve positive
biodiversity outcomes, I make the following recommendations. Firstly,
adoption of an outcomes-driven approach to the drafting of environmental objects
clauses could streamline the implementation
of Australia’s biodiversity
laws. This could involve the setting of a singular conservation objective at the
national-level
to guide all biodiversity decision-making and the use of
directing principles to guide the interpretation of objects clauses.
Second, the use of the SMART method to incorporate measurable objectives and
performance indicators in conservation planning can facilitate
the collection of
comprehensive data on species and ecological communities. This in turn will
benefit future management strategies
as it will be possible to garner a more
accurate assessment of the true condition of Australia’s biodiversity.
Third, there is scope to expand the land area of protected area networks at
the territory and Commonwealth levels. Such expansions
or the use of moveable
reserves must be actively managed and account for the protection of ecological
corridors and future climate
Fourth, listing approaches for threatened species or ecological communities
could be improved by including anticipatory listing of
‘potentially at
risk’ species. This would also be supported by the extension of critical
habitat listing to include future
climate refugia and important ecological
networks or corridors. Additionally, all national listing approaches could be
standardised
through the establishment of singular national threatened species
and ecological communities lists.
Founded on the values of ‘integrity, transparency and
accountability’, I have argued that the reform of Australia’s
environmental laws can enable the protection and conservation of our unique
biodiversity.
In this way, we
can work towards forging a future for nature and ensure that Australian laws
better reflect the environmental principles
espoused by the
World Charter for
Biodiversity Convention
