GUARDIANSHIP
the Adult Guardian is appointed as guardian for MAI for all personal
the Tribunal orders otherwise, this appointment remains current for two (2)
ENDURING POWER OF ATTORNEY
the following Enduring Power of Attorney for MAI is overtaken by the making of
this appointment and, in accordance with
Guardianship and
Administration Act 2000
can no longer be acted upon to the extent that this
appointment has been made:
(a) The Enduring Power of Attorney dated 8 June 2003 appointing MP
as attorney for personal and health matters.
ORAL REASONS FOR DECISION HANDED DOWN AT HEARING
[1] The hearing today concerns MAI. The application has
been brought by ML seeking the appointment of a guardian for her father,
[2] The hearing has taken place with the participants being ML, the applicant,
MP who is the attorney and active party represented
by BS. There was also an
attendance by OM, daughter-in-law as an active party and KM who is a friend of
the family as an interested
[3] The initial question that the Tribunal addressed was whether as of the
present time, MAI has decision-making capacity for personal
matters. All the
active parties and those taking part in the hearing today expressed the view
that MAI had impaired decision-making
capacity for personal matters.
[4] The Tribunal had access to medical reports, some of which now are a couple
of years old and some are quite recent. There is a
health professional report
from BM, registered nurse, dated 4 June 2009 addressing the statutory criteria
for capacity and BM expressed
the opinion that there was impaired
decision-making capacity based on her interpretation of records of the nursing
from Dr B, a former GP of MAI dated 24 May 2006 expressed an
opinion that notified the Tribunal that a MMSE was conducted in 2006
resulted in a score of 22 out of 30 and the doctor was of the view that MAI
could not make decisions freely and voluntarily,
although she thought at that
stage he could make simple decisions in relation to health care and personal
[5] Dr L, a neurologist reported that on 26 October 2006 that although she had
not seen MAI for about a year, she was dubious at
that stage that he would be
capable of making decisions for himself, due to the progressive nature of his
disease. There are other
medical reports which traverse the issue, but the
Tribunal is satisfied that on the medical evidence, the fact that MAI does have
a progressive disease and the evidence that his means of communication are very
limited to a nod or a squeeze and on medical evidence
are satisfied that he does
have impaired decision-making capacity at the present time for personal
[6] The next issue to be looked at by the Tribunal was whether in that case the
Enduring Power of Attorney that MAI gave to his wife,
MP on 8 June 2003 should
continue to operate as the means for decision-making on personal matters for
MAI. ML as applicant made submissions
to the Tribunal that her father had
capacity to give an Enduring Power of Attorney in June 2003 but submitted that
he had been coerced
into giving the Enduring Power of Attorney to his wife,
[7] ML referred to the fact that MP in 2001 had endeavoured to seek declarations
that MAI had impaired capacity at that stage and
submitted that it was most
unusual that in 2003, that MP was instrumental in having MAI complete a document
that can only be done
on the basis that he had capacity to do so.
[8] ML also asserted that the evidence from the Justice of the Peace who was the
witness certifying as to his capacity in 2003 was
unsatisfactory, that the
Justice of the Peace did not follow the guidelines that had been put out to
assist those persons certifying
as to the capacity of people making an Enduring
Power of Attorney.
[9] MP gave evidence that in her opinion MAI had capacity and was not coerced
into making the Enduring Power of Attorney in her favour
in 2003. MP gave
evidence that the Enduring Power of Attorney came about as a consequence of MAI
going into nursing care around that
time and was part of the documentation being
considered for completion to facilitate entry into nursing care.
[10] MP gave evidence that the forms for the Enduring Power of Attorney were
left with MAI and that he himself completed the particulars
in the forms in his
own hand and that the Justice of the Peace who witnessed his signature and who
certified his capacity was an
independent witness who had no prior knowledge of
the family or any connection with the family.
[11] The Tribunal has looked at the medical evidence and is satisfied and agrees
with the participants that there is no reason to
rebut the presumption that he
had capacity to enter into an Enduring Power of Attorney in 2003. The Tribunal
is not satisfied that
there is evidence that there was coercion upon him to do
so or coercion to get him to appoint MP as his attorney in 2003.
[12] The Tribunal will declare that MAI had the capacity to execute an Enduring
Power of Attorney dated 8 June 2003.
[13] Turning now then to the next issue that arises whether in those
circumstances with a valid Enduring Power of Attorney, is there
a need therefore
for a formal decision-maker.
Guardianship and
Administration Act 2000
sets out the requirements of this Tribunal when
making an appointment of a guardian for a personal matter. The Tribunal must be
that the adult has impaired capacity for the matter, that there is a
need for a decision in relation to the matter and that without
the appointment,
the adult’s needs will not be adequately met or the adult’s
interests will not be adequately protected.
[14] The Tribunal heard from participants as to why a formal decision-maker was
required if in fact the attorney would not continue
in that role. The applicant,
ML, gave submissions that in her opinion it would not be appropriate to leave
informal decision-making
in place for MAI as the means of relying on informal
decision-making only for personal decisions.
[15] Focusing on health care, with the knowledge that there is a regime with a
statutory health attorney, ML submitted that it would
not be appropriate due to
the conflict and the track record as to the parties or the family in making
health care decisions since
MAI has been in nursing care.
[16] The attorney, MP, through her advocate submitted that it would be
appropriate to leave health care in the realm of the statutory
health attorney
if for any reason the Enduring Power of Attorney was not operative. She was of
the view that the conflict is one
way, that she has no conflict with the
applicant, ML and that decisions could be made.
[17] However, through the course of the application it is clear that it is not
just health care decisions that may have to be made
in the future. Other
personal decisions will have to be made or may have to be made and ML has raised
the possibility that an accommodation
decision will have to be made if any
inadequacies in the current nursing home care for MAI reach a stage where it
would be more appropriate
in his interests to remove him to another
[18] Mindful that there is then before the Tribunal a real possibility that
health care, accommodation decisions and possibly other
legal decisions may have
to be made, the Tribunal has reached the opinion that leaving a position where
there is no formal decision-maker
in place would not be adequate to protect the
interests of MAI and that an appointment would need to be made so that his
are adequately met.
[19] Looking now at the appropriateness of the persons who have put themselves
forward for appointment, ML has made the application
and has relied on evidence
that she had been for a period of at least eleven (11) years involved in the
decision-making on health
care issues for MAI. ML is conscious of the General
Principles and has made submissions to the Tribunal that she considers that she
would be able to apply the General Principles in relation to decision-making and
in particular would be able to apply General Principle
8 which talks about the
importance of maintaining an adult’s existing supporting relationships
when making decisions.
[20] ML gave evidence that she would have no problem in ringing members of her
family and seeking their views as to decisions before
making those decisions as
the decision-maker for MAI.
[21] The Tribunal is intensely aware of the conflict within the family,
particularly the conflict between ML and MP. It was quite
today’s hearing. The conflict is long standing and deep. In fact it is
beyond conflict. It is a hostile relationship
that is unlikely to change in the
short term.
[22] The Tribunal is concerned that this conflict and hostility has impacted
upon the care of the adult. Mere existence of conflict
alone is not enough to
say that a particular person is not appropriate. The Tribunal has though had
evidence been given to it about
two occasions in which the hostility and
conflict has impacted directly on the adult’s care. The first occasion was
to by Mr Allen in the course of the hearing about the difficulties last
year when arrangements for dental and medical care degenerated
recently, the change of the GPs this year, Dr B and then Dr C and then Dr C
declining to continue to act as GP on the basis
of the conflictual relationship
between MP and ML that has resulted in the Tribunal’s view in the
possibility of adverse impact
on the adult’s care and wellbeing.
[23] There is also evidence before the Tribunal that MAI some years ago made
comments to a representative of the investigator from
the Adult Guardian’s
Office that he was concerned about that conflict and that he wanted the conflict
to cease. It is disturbing
that the conflict is still impacting indirectly on
MAI. These proceedings have the adult as its main focus and not the other
[24] MP has also indicated to the Tribunal that she would seek appointment as
guardian if the Tribunal was mindful of appointing
a guardian for personal
decision-making.
[25] ML has stated that MP is not appropriate in the sense that MP was directing
hospital and nursing home staff not to facilitate
or permit communication of
issues between the staff and ML about MAI’s medical and other care
[26] MP gave evidence that that did not occur, but it is clear to the Tribunal
that whatever the likely position in relation to directions
given to nursing
nursing home staff. In particular, she
refers to incidents where she has found
her father remaining for some periods of time in urine soaked sheets, that she
is concerned
that there is an inadequate checking regime for her father and she
has not been able to communicate those concerns through any effective
due to her perception, whether real or imagined, that she cannot because of her
mother’s interference communicate adequately
with nursing home staff.
[27] Once again, the Tribunal believes that this is an instance where the
conflict between MP and ML has impacted upon the adult’s
welfare and
wellbeing or has the likelihood of impacting on his welfare and care.
[28] From those examples of the impact upon the adult, the Tribunal is not
satisfied that either MP or ML would be appropriate decision-makers
on personal
matters for MAI. It is not a reflection on the love or care that either
applicant has for MAI. It is a reflection of
the current position where the
parties through their actions have allowed the situation to develop where there
have been adverse
impacts on the adult’s care and wellbeing.
[29] The parties, ML and MP, have also raised the recent incidents about the
hospital treatment for the basal cell carcinoma on MAI’s
ear. There was
conflicting evidence about whether MP had made efforts to contact ML at an early
stage. This Tribunal cannot resolve
the conflict, but the Tribunal is not
satisfied that sufficient efforts were made at an early stage to inform ML who
is passionately
concerned about her father’s well being in this particular
incident. There could have been better attempts made at an earlier
involve her in the process and that was not done.
[30] The Tribunal then is left with the situation that if neither MP nor ML are
considered appropriate decision-makers because of
their own actions in the
context of this conflict between them, then the only other alternative in the
absence of any other persons
who are willing to act in that role is to appoint
the Adult Guardian. The Tribunal is mindful of the provisions in
Guardianship and Administration Act 2000
which states that the Tribunal
may appoint the Adult Guardian as guardian for a matter only if there is no
other appropriate person
available for appointment for the matter.
[31] The Tribunal comes reluctantly to the conclusion that this is a situation
where there is no other person appropriate for appointment
decision-maker for personal matters MAI and will appoint the Adult Guardian to
be his decision-maker for all personal matters
for a period of two (2)
[32] It is important that all parties are aware that the Tribunal has not set
aside the Enduring Power of Attorney. It is overtaken
by this appointment. The
Tribunal is mindful that MAI chose MP to be his decision-maker in 2003. This is
2009 and there have been
too many incidents in the Tribunal’s view which
indicate at the present time that decision-making process is unworkable. Whether
it remains unworkable is now the responsibility of the family to try and work
out and to ascertain in two (2) years time whether
in fact a decision-making
regime other than an independent decision-maker would then be appropriate and
wish that that does occur.
But that depends entirely on, and is in the hands of,
the family once this particular term of appointment expires.
