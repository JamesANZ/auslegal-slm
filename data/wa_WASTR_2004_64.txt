Previous proceedings
9 Under my file reference ST/2003-000091, I made an order, on the application
of Crest Gold & Jewellery Pty Ltd, on 7 November
following terms
"Unless by 15 December 2003, The Owners of 58, 60 and 62 Adelaide Street and 11
Point Street Fremantle – Strata Plan 8583 ("the
Strata Company") has
granted to the proprietor of Lots 2, 3 and 4 on the Strata Plan a lease or
exclusive use or special privileges
by-law over the common property accessway
and toilet areas adjacent to the lots on the said Strata Plan, or the proprietor
1 on the Strata Plan has otherwise given approval in writing for the
continuation of the use of the said accessway and toilet areas
by the proprietor
of Lots 2, 3 and 4 on the Strata Plan, the proprietor of Lots 2, 3 and 4 by that
date, at that proprietor's risk
and cost in all respects
(a) remove or cause to be removed from the
said accessway and toilet areas all fixtures, fittings, plant, machinery or the

or kept in those areas by the proprietor of Lots 2, 3 and 4;
(b) thereafter must not without first obtaining such a lease, by-law or
approval replace any of those items in the said accessway
and toilet areas.
PROVIDED THAT until 15 February 2004 this Order shall not apply to the sink and

adjacent to the said Lots 2,
And I direct that pursuant to s 81(10) this Order shall not cease to have any

the making if this
Submissions in previous
10 Crest Gold & Jewellery Pty Ltd’s submissions in the previous
proceedings included complaints about fixtures, fittings
and other materials
stored in a common property accessway in the building. It stated that it had
asked a member of Gibney’s
Dry Cleaners Pty
“...to remove appliances and fixtures and fittings several times. He has
refused and keeps adding more items to common property
– especially items
used to running his dry cleaning business which should be contained in his own
premises. There have been
no requests by him to use the common
11 The items complained of by Crest Gold & Jewellery Pty Ltd were washing
machines, a compressor and auto clothes dryer, a refrigerator,
and two large
storage wall units installed in and used by the Applicant in this matter, in the
common property areas.
12 The other item referred to was a sink and cupboard
Applicant’s submissions
13 In this matter, Gibney’s Dry Cleaners Pty Ltd, as the Applicant has
indicated that the only remaining item in the common
property area is the sink
and cupboard unit.
Order sought
14 The Applicant has sought an Order under Section 83 (1) in the following
“An order for the settlement of a dispute, that the sink and cupboard
installed in the common area accessway adjacent to Lots
2, 3 and 4, are and form
part of the common
Applicant's
submissions
15 The Applicant contends that the sink and cupboard unit was installed as a
fixture, in 1965, long before the Strata Plan was registered.
16 In support, the Applicant has provided an unsigned unsworn statement from a
former employee that she was employed by the Applicant
from 1968 to 1969 and
again in the 1980s. The statement records the employees belief that the sink
and cupboard were in place when
she commenced work on the
Response to application
17 The present Applicant has made application to a Court of Petty Sessions
(presumably pursuant to s 116) for an Order that
Cleaners Pty Ltd has, by not removing the sink and cupboard, has breached my
previous Order.
Considerations
18 On 9 November 2004, my Registrar wrote to Gibney’s Dry Cleaners Pty
Ltd advising in part
“... the purpose of your new application appears to be to obtain a
declaration that could be used as defence in the Court of
Petty Sessions.
In the circumstances, the Referee believes that if you have sufficient evidence
to satisfy the Court that the cupboard and sink were
affixed in their present
position in the common property access way when the Strata Plan was registered,
there is no need for the
Referee to deal with the matter at all, as the Court
must still satisfy itself that there is adequate evidence to support your
If you have witnesses who can support your claims, those witnesses
should give their evidence directly to the
19 In the circumstances, I have resolved to dismiss the application on the
basis that the further “evidence” by the
Applicant, in form and
content, is inconclusive or inadmissible and that even if I were to make a
declaration of the kind sought
by the Applicant, the Court of Petty Session
would still have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that my previous Order
been breached.
20 My Order is that
“The application be
dismissed.”
