STATEMENT OF DECISION AND REASONS
APPLICATION FOR REVIEW
Ms Seo was born in 1936 in Korea. She arrived in Australia on 31 October 2007
on a Subclass 976 visitor visa that ceased on 31
January 2008. Ms Seo
nevertheless remained in Australia.
On 11 March 2014 Ms Seo applied for an Other Family (Residence) (Class BU) visa
Migration Act 1958
(the Act) on the basis that she was an aged
dependent relative of her sponsor, her daughter Soo Kyung Yang.
On 13 May 2014 the delegate refused to grant the visa on the basis that
cl.838.211 was not met. In particular the delegate found
that Ms Seo did not
meet the Schedule 3 criteria.
On 9 June 2015 Ms Seo’s migration agent wrote to the tribunal and noted
that Ms Seo understood that there was no prospect
of success in her application
and consented for the tribunal to make a decision on the papers. Ms Seo
indicated that she intends
to seek Ministerial
intervention.
CONSIDERATION OF CLAIMS AND EVIDENCE
The visa application was made on the basis that Ms Seo is the aged dependent
relative of her daughter Ms Soo Kyung Yang. Amongst
other things, an applicant
is required to satisfy Schedule 3 criteria:
Clause 838.211 provides:
838.211 The applicant is:
(a) the holder of a substantive visa (other than a Subclass 771 (Transit)
(b) a person who:
(i) is not the holder of a substantive visa; and
(ii) immediately before ceasing to hold a substantive visa, was not the
holder of a Subclass 771 (Transit) visa; and
(iii) satisfies Schedule 3 criterion 3002.
Ms Seo was not the holder of a substantive visa or a Subclass 771 visa at the
time of the aged dependent relative visa application.
Therefore Ms Seo must
satisfy Schedule 3 criterion 3002:
3002 The application is
validly made within 12 months after the relevant day (within the meaning of
subclause 3001(2)).
The relevant day in this context is that date that the person last held a
substantive visa.
Ms Seo last held a substantive visa on 31 January 2008. The visa application
was made over five years later on 11 March 2014.
Ms Seo does not meet criterion 3002. There is no provision to waive this
requirement.
This means that Ms Seo does not satisfy cl.838.211.
It follows that Ms Seo does not meet the criteria for a Subclass 838 visa. In
respect of the other visa subclasses, there is no
material which would permit a
finding that she meets the prescribed criteria for the visa sought.
The tribunal affirms the decision not to grant the applicant an Other Family
(Residence) (Class BU) visa.
