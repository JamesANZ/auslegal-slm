G CONCLUSION AND
A INTRODUCTION
1 If there was ever a
case demonstrating unnecessary and bewildering complication in the law, it is
this one. On one level, it is
difficult to imagine a simpler dispute. Picture
the familiar scene: a man goes into a car showroom and buys a car. He haggles
settles upon one he likes. He is happy with the look of it, and he is told
it is a very good car. He hands over his money and contentedly
drives out of the
dealership. In his excitement, he is more interested in breathing in the
ambrosial new car smell than reflecting
on the reality that, as soon as he drove
out of the dealership, the market value of the car had diminished.
2 But he was not told something. Unbeknownst to him, and indeed to the
dealer, his car had a problem. Although apparently safe to
drive, it was not
designed to function properly during all driving conditions and, even if driven
normally, there was a substantial
likelihood that white smoke would come out of
the car’s exhaust, along with a malodour. This problem also meant it was
the car would use more petrol than expected and he would receive
excessive notifications requiring him to service the car. Although
he bought the
car in ignorance of the problem, he did appreciate that if there were any such
issues, the cost of fixing them would
not be his responsibility.
3 If he had of known the true position, there is
no question in my mind that he would likely have paid less for the car. After
it was not the problem-free car he thought he had purchased.
4 One would intuitively think that such a case should not be in the least
complex. This has not proven to be the case. This is partly
because a class
action has been brought, and partly because of the lamentable drafting of some
statutory provisions. Further, the
parties (the respondent, Toyota Motor
Corporation Australia Limited (
), in particular) have maintained
issues, which should have either been conceded or agreed. The result was a
hearing taking weeks
and hundreds of pages of submissions.
5 Before turning to consider the minutiae of the claims advanced, by way of
introduction, it is worth sketching the broad outline
of the case.
6 It is not in dispute that between 1 October 2015 and 23 April 2020
Relevant Period
), 264,170 Toyota cars in the Prado, Fortuner and HiLux
ranges and fitted with so-called “1GD-FTV” or “2GD-FTV”
diesel combustion engines were supplied to consumers in Australia (
). Each Relevant Vehicle was supplied with a diesel exhaust
after-treatment system (
), which was defective because it was
not designed to function effectively during all reasonably expected conditions
of normal operation
and use of the vehicle.
7 The first applicant in this class action is Mr
Kenneth John Williams. The second applicant is a company of which Mr Williams is
the sole director, Direct Claim Services Qld Pty Ltd (
), and through
which he conducts his business as a motor vehicle accidents assessor. It is
common ground that DCS acquired a Prado
Relevant Prado
) during the
Relevant Period and paid the associated tax, financing and fuel costs. The
evidence establishes that the Relevant Prado
has been plagued with problems
associated with the defective DPF System.
8 As it turned out, and despite some initial confusion, any cause of action
that exists belongs to DCS. The claim of Mr Williams was
dismissed at the
conclusion of oral argument (although both Mr Williams and DCS remain
representative applicants, pursuant to
Federal Court of
Australia Act 1976
9 TMCA is the “manufacturer” of the Relevant Vehicles for the
purpose of s 7 of the
Australian Consumer Law
), being Sch 2
Competition and Consumer Act
(Cth). TMCA also marketed
the Relevant Vehicles in Australia, and in doing so made representations about
the quality and characteristics
of those vehicles and the DPF System to
prospective consumers.
10 The group members whom the applicants represent are persons who acquired a
Relevant Vehicle during the Relevant Period (and otherwise
meet the description
of group members in the second further amended statement of claim
11 The claims made by DCS on its own behalf, and by both Mr Williams and DCS
on behalf of group members are, in summary, that:
(1) the Relevant Vehicles as supplied were not of “acceptable
quality” and therefore failed to comply with the statutory
guarantee in s
54 of the ACL; and
(2) TMCA made misleading representations and omissions about the Relevant
Vehicles, in contravention of
(1)(a) and (g), and
of the ACL.
12 A number of subsidiary issues arise when considering these causes of
action and the relief that should be obtained from those actions,
general level, this is the case advanced.
13 Finally, by way of introduction, given the size of the record, I have
adopted the expedient of incorporating some references to
agreed facts and other
documents in these reasons (although I should caveat this by noting that a
reference is often illustrative,
rather than identifying an exclusive
B THE RELEVANT FACTS AND EVIDENCE
14 Following
the adoption of two reports of a referee (the first dated 15 October 2020
First Referee’s Report
) and the second dated 31 August 2021
Second Referee’s Report
) (together,
)), and the preparation of a statement of agreed facts (
) and supplementary statement of agreed facts (
for the purposes of
Evidence Act 1995
one would have thought there would only be a simulacrum of
a dispute remaining as to the facts. As it transpired, this assumption
somewhat optimistic, and it is necessary to deal with a number of contested
factual issues. Before doing so, however, it is convenient
to canvass briefly
the facts upon which the parties agreed and provide an overview of the evidence
adduced at the trial.
B.1 Agreed Facts
15 Drawing upon the detailed
Agreed Facts (which delve into issues with technicality and granularity), it is
useful to summarise the
DPF System, the
Core Defect
and the effective
(1) Each of the Relevant Vehicles contained either a 1GD-FTV or a 2GD-FTV diesel
combustion engine. Such diesel combustion engines
generate pollutant emissions:
AF 34]. The DPF System is designed to capture and convert the pollutant
emissions into carbon dioxide
and water vapour through a combination of
filtration, combustion (that is, ‘oxidation’) and chemical
reactions: AF [42].
(2) All Relevant Vehicles were fitted with a DPF System: AF [33], [39]. This was
necessary at least because the Relevant Vehicles,
throughout the Relevant
Period, were required to comply with national emissions standards prescribed by
the applicable Australian
Design Rules, which standards regulated the emission
of Pollutant Emissions: AF [35]–[39].
(3) The nature of the DPF System in the Relevant Vehicles is described in detail
in the Agreed Facts: AF [33]–[66]. Two core
components of the DPF System
are the diesel particulate filter (
) and the diesel oxidation catalyst
), which sit together in the
DPF Assembly
[46]–[47]. The basic design of the DPF Assembly in the Relevant Vehicles
is illustrated by the following image (showing a
cross section):
(4) The DPF is designed to capture what is called diesel particulate matter in
the exhaust gas prior to its release, and to store
it: AF [42], [47]. The DPFs
in the Relevant Vehicles have a finite capacity to capture and store particulate
matter: AF [51]. As
such, in order for the DPF to function effectively, the
particulate matter captured by and stored in the DPF must be burned off
periodically
in a process called regeneration: AF [53]. Regeneration requires
the exhaust temperature to increase to the level required for the
particulate
matter to oxidise: AF [57], [73(g)].
(5) The DOC comprises a honeycomb ceramic flow-through monolith substrate with a
catalyst coating containing precious metals: AF
[46(a)]. One of the functions of
the DOC is to increase the temperature in the DPF during regeneration: AF
[46(b)(ii)]. When the
DOC becomes clogged or blocked, the DPF is impeded from
regenerating effectively: First
Referee’s Report (at [8], [39],
[47], [55]).
(6) When regeneration does not occur, or is ineffective, the DPF becomes blocked
with particulate matter, and the vehicles experience
a range of problems.
Indeed, the Core Defect
was described by the referee in his initial
report in the following terms (at [8]):
The DPF System was defective for the whole of the Relevant Period. The
was that the DPF System was not designed to function effectively
during all reasonably expected conditions of normal operation and
Australian market. In particular, under certain conditions the DPF System was
ineffective in preventing the formation
of deposits on the DOC surface or coking
within the DOC. The deposits and/or coking of the DOC prevented the DPF filter
from effective
automatic or manual regeneration, and led to excessive white
smoke and foul-smelling exhaust during regeneration and/or indications
engine’s onboard diagnostic (OBD) system that the DPF was
This defect was inherent in the design of the DPF System. The design defect was
comprised of both mechanical defects and defective
control logic and associated
software calibrations.
(Emphasis in original).
(7) A key occurrence which caused the Core Defect to manifest was the exposure
of a Relevant Vehicle to regular continuous driving
at approximately 100km per
High Speed Driving Pattern
): AF [67].
(8) During the Relevant Period, in Relevant Vehicles in which the Core Defect
was present, if the Relevant Vehicles were exposed
to the High Speed Driving
Pattern and/or subject to the countermeasures other than those referred to below
(at [15(10)]):
(a) the DOC became blocked by deposits forming on the face of the DOC;
(b) regeneration events failed to remove sufficient particulate matter from the
DPF to prevent the DPF from becoming or remaining
full or blocked;
(c) the DPF System failed to prevent the DPF from becoming full or blocked;
(d) the DOC and DPF did not function effectively;
(e) the catalytic efficiency of the DOC was diminished; and
(f) the exhaust in the DPF did not reach a sufficiently high temperature to
effect thermal oxidation (the chemical reaction of particulate
matter with
oxygen at a sufficiently high temperature, resulting in carbon dioxide and water
vapour) (see AF [73]).
(9) In the Relevant Vehicles that experienced the effects of the Core Defect,
symptoms included excessive white smoke and foul-smelling
exhaust being emitted
from the vehicle’s exhaust during regeneration, and DPF notifications
displaying on an excessive number
of occasions or for an excessive period of
time. It will be necessary to address with precision the consequences of the
Core Defect
in further depth below.
(10) TMCA attempted a series of countermeasures to
fix the problem. Two countermeasures are presently relevant:
countermeasure introduced and applied to all new Relevant Vehicles at the time
of production (
2018 Production Change
countermeasure introduced from May 2020 (
2020 Field Fix)
. It is common
ground that the 2020 Field Fix was effective and will continue to be effective
in remedying the Core Defect and its
consequences in all Relevant Vehicles: see
(11) Similarly, from June 2020, all Relevant Vehicles were produced with the
countermeasure preventing the Core Defect from manifesting
2020 Production
): AF [175].
16 TMCA’s knowledge concerning these matters, and the development of
the issues in relation to the Relevant Vehicles generally,
are detailed
comprehensively in the Agreed Facts: see AF [125]–[179]. There is no need
to set them out here. It sufficies to
note that, essentially, from February
2016, TMCA was aware that some Relevant Vehicles were being presented to dealers
by customers
(called by TMCA, somewhat oddly, as “guests”) who
reported concerns with, among other things, the emission of excessive
smoke during regeneration and the illumination of DPF notifications. Over the
next four years before the introduction of the
2020 Field Fix; the number of
complaints increased dramatically; the issues were escalated to the top levels
of TMCA and its parent
company in Japan, Toyota Motor Corporation (
and a number of countermeasures were introduced, tested and failed. I will
expand upon the relevance of TMCA’s knowledge
of the Core Defect and its
consequences where necessary below.
17 Despite the parties’ constructive approach to the production of the
Agreed Facts, as I foreshadowed, some residual issues
relevant to the question
of liability remain in dispute.
B.2 The evidence generally
is also convenient here to survey briefly the evidence that was given at trial.
It may be observed from the outset that most
of the evidence led concerned
issues of loss and damage, and in particular, the quantification of the
“reduction in value”
resulting from the Core Defect.
B.2.1 Mr Williams
19 Mr Williams swore two
affidavits and gave evidence for approximately half a day. His first affidavit
was sworn on 11 December 2020
First Williams Affidavit
). He was a
witness whose credit was not impeached and his affidavit evidence was
essentially unchallenged. Mr Williams’ evidence
is primarily relevant to
three broad issues remaining in dispute, namely:
(1) the Core Defect and its consequences, when those consequences manifested,
and the impact of those consequences upon the use and
enjoyment of the Relevant
(2) the extent to which he relied upon the representations made by TMCA; and
(3) any consequential loss and damage he suffered by reason of the Core Defect
and its consequences, particularly with respect to
increased fuel consumption
experienced by the Relevant Prado.
B.2.2 Messrs Nelson, Jones, Gray and Berndt
20 Mr Martin John Nelson
is the Divisional Manager of TMCA’s Guest First Division, a position he
has held since late 2017. He
affirmed one affidavit on 5 October 2021 (
concerning communications between TMCA and dealers, and TMCA and
customers, and the roll out of the countermeasures, as well as amounts
replacement vehicles provided to customers under TMCA’s consumer redress
programme. He gave evidence for approximately
half a day.
21 Mr Nelson’s evidence indicated that TMCA, at least internally,
recognised that the Core Defect and its consequences interfere
with the use and
enjoyment of the Relevant Vehicles. The findings of fact that emerge from Mr
Nelson’s evidence in this respect
will be explored in greater detail
below, but it is convenient to note here that his evidence establishes that:
(1) TMCA recognised, from an early stage in the Relevant Period, that the issues
affecting the DPF System in the Relevant Vehicles
posed a serious threat to
TMCA’s market reputation: Nelson Affidavit (at [82]);
(2) TMCA has approached the DPF issues as a serious matter deserving of the
urgent attention of TMC, and has dedicated substantial
resources to attempting
to remedy the issues (T84.22–25); and
(3) since the commencement of this proceeding, TMCA has offered refunds and
replacement vehicles to “hundreds” of consumers,
in recognition of
the failure of the vehicles to comply with statutory guarantees under the ACL
(T98.25–99.13; 103.39–40).
22 TMCA also relies on the affidavits of three further witnesses:
(1) Mr Brent Andrew Jones, the Manager, Digital Marketplace of TMCA, who gave
evidence in relation to webpages published on TMCA’s
website about DPF
issues and the number of times they were accessed (
Jones Affidavit
(2) Mr Nathanael David Gray, the Manager, National Business Fleet Sales of TMCA,
who gave evidence in relation to the categories
of purchasers of Relevant
Gray Affidavit
(3) Mr David Berndt, an employee of TMCA’s solicitors, who gave evidence
of what was set out in a spreadsheet which contained
details of the Relevant
Berndt Affidavit
23 The evidence of these witnesses was relatively uncontroversial and will be
elaborated upon where necessary below.
B.2.4 The expert evidence
24 The primary contest
relates to the expert evidence adduced in respect of the quantification of a
reduction in value of the Relevant
Vehicles for the purposes of the
applicants’ case concerning acceptable quality under s 54 of the ACL. It
is convenient to
introduce the general nature of that evidence here and the
ambit of the dispute, which I will expand upon in Part E.2.3 below.
Mr Cuthbert and Mr O’Mara
25 Both sides adduced
valuation evidence. Mr Graeme Cuthbert, engaged by the applicants, is a licensed
motor vehicle trader and car
valuer with 50 years’ experience. He provided
two reports before the trial: one dated 23 July 2021 (
First Cuthbert
) and one dated 22 October 2021 (
Second Cuthbert Report
Tim O’Mara, whom TMCA engaged, is a valuer and the Managing Director of
O’Maras, a valuation and auction house.
Mr O’Mara specialises in
valuing company assets for the purposes of merger and acquisition transactions
and bank financing.
He provided a first report dated 30 September 2021
O’Mara Report
) and a second dated 26 November 2021
O’Mara Report
). Both experts participated in a joint
conference and provided a further report dated 10 November 2021 in response to a
questions put to them by the Court during their concurrent oral
evidence. Both valuers gave evidence principally about the true value
Relevant Prado as at the date of acquisition (8 April 2016), having regard to
the presence of the Core Defect and a propensity
for the consequences associated
with it in the Relevant Prado.
Mr Stockton and Dr Pleatsikas
26 Both sides also
adduced expert evidence in the field of economics. Mr Edward Stockton, a Vice
President and Director of Economic
Services at the Fontana Group, is an
economist and econometrician with expertise in automobile markets and studies of
of defects on motor vehicle prices. Mr Stockton was engaged by the
applicants and provided two reports: one dated 23 July 2021 (
First Stockton
) and another dated 22 October 2021 (
Second Stockton Report
Dr Christopher Jon Pleatsikas, an economist and a Vice President at Charles
River Associates, was called by TMCA, and provided
a report dated 30 September
Pleatsikas Report
). Both experts participated in a joint expert
conference, out of which they produced a joint report dated 5 November 2021
Stockton and Pleatsikas Joint Report
27 Generally speaking, the economic evidence was directed to Mr
Stockton’s repair cost model analysis, which essentially used
the warranty
repair cost that TMCA reimbursed to dealers for performing the 2020 Field Fix as
a proxy for the amount of money that
would have been required, at the time of
purchase, to restore group members to the position they would have been in had
compliance with the statutory guarantee.
Mr Boedeker and Dr Rossi
applicants also adduced evidence from Mr Stefan Boedeker, an economist with
specialist expertise in conjoint analysis and Managing
Director of the Berkeley
Research Group. Conjoint analysis, in simple terms, is a survey-based
statistical technique deployed in
market research to determine how people value
different attributes in a product or service. Mr Boedeker prepared three
first dated 23 July 2021 (
First Boedeker Report
); a second
dated 28 October 2021 (
Second Boedeker Report
); and a third dated 4
December 2021 (
Third Boedeker Report
). Dr Rossi, an econometrician and
Professor of Marketing, Statistics and Economics at the University of
California, Los Angeles,
was instructed by TMCA and prepared a report dated 4
October 2021 (
Rossi Report
). Mr Boedeker and Dr Rossi participated in a
joint expert conference and produced a joint report dated 19 November 2021,
separate statements summarising the issues between them (
and Rossi Report
29 The evidence of Mr Boedeker and Dr Rossi
concerned a “choice-based conjoint” survey created by Mr Boedeker
purposes of assessing any reduction in value resulting from the Core
Defect and its consequences. Mr Boedeker engaged a third party
) to programme, host and implement the survey and relied on
another third party provider (
) to select participants for the
survey. Over 4,000 participants were surveyed, and Mr Boedeker’s final
analysis considered
3,565 responses (
Analysed Responses
Rossi’s evidence was responsive to Mr Boedeker’s evidence.
B.3 Additional findings
30 The factual issues in
dispute on the question of liability are largely concerned with the scope and
frequency of the Core Defect
and its consequences. With some degree of
simplification, the following four issues remain for determination:
(1) Was the Core Defect present in vehicles which had the 2018 Production
(2) Did all
Relevant Vehicles have a propensity to suffer from the
consequences of the Core Defect?
(3) What was the significance of the Core Defect and its consequences?
(4) Was the market aware of the Core Defect and its consequences during the
Relevant Period?
31 I will deal with each of these contested issues in turn.
B.3.1 Was the Core Defect present in vehicles which had the
2018 Production Change?
32 While it may have been
thought that the findings made by the Court upon adoption of the reports of the
referee and recorded in
the Agreed Facts were clear, TMCA seeks to draw a
distinction between the Relevant Vehicles:
(1) produced prior to June 2018 (
Pre-MY2018 Production Vehicles
(2) produced between 1 June 2018 and 23 April 2020 (
MY2018 Relevant
33 The relevance of the date 1 June 2018 is that, as foreshadowed above (at
–(11)]), the 2018 Production
Change countermeasure was introduced by TMCA and applied to all new Relevant
Vehicles on this date.
34 Initially, TMCA sought to contend, in its defence, that vehicles that were
subject to the 2018 Production Change did not suffer
from the Core Defect at the
time they were supplied: Defence to Second Further Amended Statement of Claim
) (at [52(a)], [100(c)]; see also [39(c)–(d)], [41(b)]). In
TMCA’s opening submissions, however, it was accepted that
any submission
to the effect that the 2018 Production Change remedied the Core Defect “is
unlikely to be accepted”. Accordingly,
TMCA initially stated that,
“for the purposes of the initial trial, TMCA does not dispute that the
Core Defect was present
in the DPF Systems of all Relevant Vehicles until such
time as they received/receive the 2020 Field Fix”.
35 TMCA now contends that the Core Defect was not present in vehicles which
had the 2018 Production Change (that is, the MY2018 Relevant
Vehicles), or
alternatively that the 2018 Production Change was effective to prevent Relevant
Vehicles from suffering from the Core
Defect. The issue affects 37 per cent
(98,861) of the Relevant Vehicles. In support of this contention, it is said
that the referee’s
conclusions with respect to the vehicles to which the
2018 Production Change was applied were ambiguous and, in these circumstances,
the Court can and should find that the Core Defect was not present in the MY2018
Relevant Vehicles: see T4.12–44.
36 Whether the 2020 Countermeasures included the 2018 Production Change and
whether the 2018 Production Change had been effective
are matters that were
debated by the parties in the submissions provided to the referee as part of the
Second Referee’s Report:
see Annexure A [50]; Annexure E [13]–[15];
Annexure F [24]–[25]. TMCA submits that notwithstanding those submissions,
and while the referee specifically asked for information about the 2018
Production Change, he did not express any indication in his
Second Report about
the effectiveness of that change, nor did he state whether or not the 2020
Countermeasures (which he defined
as the “countermeasures implemented
after the Relevant Period”) included the 2018 Production Change. The
so-called ambiguity
in the First Referee’s Report is said to arise from
the following statements (at [12] and [50]):
12. The countermeasures
put in place
after the Relevant Period appear to
remedy the defects in the DPF System, in those Relevant Vehicles which have
received the most
recent countermeasures.
50. Countermeasures
released after
the Relevant Period appear to
have been designed to eliminate the root causes of the core defect in the DPF
System identified in the
above paragraph.
(Emphasis added).
37 On the assumption this construction will be favoured, TMCA submits the
following evidence demonstrates the 2018 Production Change
was effective in
remedying the Core Defect:
(1) As at 31 July 2021, only 636 MY2018 Relevant Vehicles had DPF-related
reimbursement claims made by dealers, comprising 0.64 per
cent of MY2018
Relevant Vehicles and 0.24 per cent of the total number of Relevant Vehicles.
This is of importance, it is said, given
the referee noted in his Second Report
(at [33]) that the “primary indicator” that the “2020
Countermeasures”
were effective is that only 1.13 per cent of vehicles
which had the 2020 Field Fix had any DPF-related claim in the year after it
applied, and the percentage of MY2018 Relevant Vehicles that had DPF-related
reimbursement claims made by dealers was lower (0.64
per cent), evidencing the
effectiveness of design changes made.
(2) The referee concluded in the First Reference Report (at [18]) that only
Pre-MY2018 Production Vehicles required unusual or abnormal
maintenance,
All Relevant Vehicles produced from the start of production through the end of
MY 2017 [i.e. model year 2017] required unusual or
abnormal maintenance
according to the criteria set out in paragraph 16.(b) because they were included
in at least one CSE to address
the DPF System.
(3) Given this conclusion did not apply to MY2018 Production Vehicles, it is
said that this indicates the referee accepted that the
2018 Production Change
was effective.
(4) Mr Nelson gave unchallenged evidence that “all indications we had was
] the 2018 production fix was very effective”: T98.23. Given
the effectiveness of the 2018 Production Change, it made sense,
it is said, for
the action taken after 1 June 2018 to be focussed on Pre-MY2018 Production
Vehicles (e.g., the “Special Policy
Adjustment + letter” sent only
to owners of Pre-MY2018 Production Vehicles extended the warranty for Pre-MY2018
Vehicles to 10 years from the first delivery date for DPF issues): AF
38 Finally, it is said that even if the Court finds the Core Defect existed
in MY2018 Relevant Vehicles, it is clear that the MY2018
Relevant Vehicles are
no more prone to suffer from any of the consequences of the Core Defect than the
vehicles that had the 2020
39 These submissions are devoid of merit and must be rejected. They
misconstrue the referee’s reports and the Agreed Facts.
Further, any
contention that the 2018 Production Change was effective in remedying the Core
Defect is unsupported by the evidence.
I will deal with each of these topics in
The Referee Reports and the Agreed Facts
40 The contentions
advanced by TMCA are inconsistent with the referee’s conclusions and the
proper understanding of the Agreed
41 No complaint was made by TMCA, in the course of adoption of the
referee’s reports, that the referee’s findings were
materially incomplete, or otherwise failed to have regard to important evidence
that TMCA put before the referee. Indeed,
TMCA advocated for the adoption of the
reports. Having been adopted, the referee’s conclusions constitute
findings of the Court,
and the parties are bound by them:
CPB Contractors Pty
Ltd v Celsus Pty Ltd (No 2)
[2018] FCA 2112
(2018) 268 FCR 590
604–6 [55]–[62] per Lee J). As such, it is not open to TMCA to seek
to contradict those findings at trial, nor advocate
a finding which, as a
critical step in its reasoning, depends upon a proposition of fact or law which
contradicts those findings:
Tranquility Pools & Spas Pty Ltd v Huntsman
Chemical Co Australia Pty Ltd
[2011] NSWSC 75
(at [36], [38(8)] per Einstein
Wenco Industrial Pty Ltd v W Industries Pty Ltd
[2009] VSCA 191
(2009) 25 VR 119
(at 124 [11] per Redlich and Bongiorno JJA and Beach AJA).
42 Additionally, TMCA is not permitted to adduce evidence to contradict or
qualify a fact upon which the parties have agreed unless
the Court grants it
leave to do so: s 191(2)(b)
Evidence Act
43 The inconsistencies between TMCA’s new contentions, on the one hand,
and the referee’s findings and the Agreed Facts
on the other, are borne
out by an analysis of the specifics.
44 The difficulty with TMCA’s contentions is that the referee concluded
in his First Report (at [8], [10], [38]–[39],
[43]) that the Core Defect
was present in
Relevant Vehicles, including those produced from 2018
onwards, and that the DPF System in the Relevant Vehicles was defective for
of the Relevant Period. Indeed, it is an agreed fact that the DPF
System “was defective for the
of the Relevant Period”
(AF [67] emphasis added), and that this constituted a Core Defect inherent in
the design of the DPF
System: AF [67]–[69]. The referee also noted in his
First Report (at [11]–[12]) that:
11. The countermeasures attempted by the Respondent during the Relevant Period
ineffective
to remedy the problem, and in some cases caused the DPF
System to malfunction in Relevant Vehicles which had not previously suffered
from any defect consequences.
12. The countermeasures
put in place
after the Relevant Period appear to
remedy the defects in the DPF System, in those Relevant Vehicles which have
received the most
recent countermeasures. The documents provided for my review
do not indicate if the [Relevant Prado] has received the most recent
countermeasures. If this is not the case, the defects remain present in that
(Emphasis added).
45 Similarly, the referee considered that the “[c]ountermeasures
the Relevant Period appear to have been designed to
eliminate the root causes of the core defect in the DPF System”: First
Referee’s Report (at [50], emphasis in original).
46 There is nothing ambiguous about the referee’s conclusion. TMCA is
wrong to submit that “whether or not the 2018 Production
effective was not the subject of any express findings by the Referee”. The
conclusion in the First Referee’s
Report (at [11]) that the
countermeasures attempted by TMCA during the Relevant Period were ineffective
and in some cases caused
the DPF System to malfunction in Relevant Vehicles
which had not previously suffered from any of the consequences of the Core
applies to the 2018 Production Change. Mr Nelson’s evidence
confirms what is otherwise obvious; namely, that the 2018 Production
meets the description of a “countermeasure
during the Relevant Period”: Nelson Affidavit (at [104]–[105],
emphasis added).
47 This conclusion is supported by the fact that:
(1) in the First Referee’s Report (at [50]), the countermeasures that the
referee concluded to be effective are described as
countermeasures
” the Relevant Period;
(2) in the Second Referee’s Report (at [32]), the referee enumerates the
specific elements of the “2020 Countermeasures”
which he considered
to be effective, namely “ECM reflash, DPF assembly replacement, Additional
Injector Housing Assembly replacement”,
which mirror the 2020 Field Fix
elements, and do not align with the elements of the 2018 Production Change;
(3) the referee’s finding the Second Referee’s Report (at [34]) that
the 2020 Countermeasures were equally effective
for Relevant Vehicles with or
without the 2018 Production Change is difficult to reconcile with any submission
that 2020 Countermeasures
were intended to
the 2018 Production
Change itself.
48 Properly read, there is no ambiguity in the referee’s reports or the
Agreed Facts.
Effectiveness of 2018 Production Change
49 Even if it were open
to TMCA to seek to relitigate the effectiveness of the 2018 Production Change,
TMCA has not adduced evidence
capable of supporting a finding that the 2018
Production Change was effective in remedying the Core Defect, or rendering the
subject to it less prone to the consequences of the Core Defect.
, the only evidence that TMCA has sought to adduce on this
issue is hearsay in the form of a submission made to the referee. Even
evidence were admissible for a hearsay purpose (and notwithstanding r 28.67(2)
Federal Court Rules 2011
(Cth)), the document simply establishes
that vehicles which had the 2018 Production Change have experienced a relatively
low incidence
of DPF issues in their first three years of service. The fact
remains that: (a) the Core Defect is present in these vehicles; and
referee concluded in his First Report (at [43]) that by reason of the presence
of the Core Defect, these vehicles
experience one or more
consequences of the Core Defect when exposed to the High Speed Driving Pattern.
In order to prove that the
incidence of consequences associated with the Core
Defect in the MY2018 Relevant Vehicles will
low (because the 2018
Production Change was substantially effective in remedying the Core Defect
and/or the associated consequences)
TMCA would have needed to lead evidence to
this effect, which it did not.
, TMCA submits that a significant indicator that the
referee accepted that the 2018 Production change was effective is the fact that
the referee did not make any finding to the effect that vehicles which had
received the 2018 Production Change required unusual or
abnormal maintenance.
This submission proceeds upon a false premise. The referee noted that the
consequences of the Core Defect included
that: (a) “Affected Vehicles must
be inspected, serviced and/or repaired by a service engineer for the purpose of
repairing or replacing the DPF, the DPF System, (or components
thereof)”; and (b) “Affected Vehicles must be inspected,
and/or repaired more regularly than would be required absent the Vehicle
Defects”: see First Referee’s Report
(at Annexure F
[41(o)–(p)]). Those conclusions applied to
Relevant Vehicles
and are not limited to those that did not receive the 2018 Production Change.
, TMCA seeks to draw support from Mr Nelson’s evidence
that “all indications we had was [
] the 2018 production fix was
very effective”: T98.23. At best, that is evidence of TMCA’s
understanding of the effectiveness
of the 2018 Production Change at the
particular point in time that Mr Nelson was addressing (that is, August 2019),
and falls short
of evidence capable of supporting a finding that the 2018
Production Change was in fact effective. In any event, the evidence is
inconsistent with the referee’s conclusions for the reasons I have
, while I do not place a great deal of reliance on this
factor, the contention that the 2018 Production Change was itself effective
remedy the Core Defect is inconsistent with TMCA’s own conduct, internal
records and analysis. Even after developing the
2018 Production Change, TMCA
recognised that the technical changes at the heart of those countermeasures were
ineffective to remedy
the Core Defect: AF [152]‑–[155]. As such,
TMCA continued to pursue an effective fix and, upon developing the 2020 Field
Fix, issued instructions to dealers to apply the 2020 Field Fix to vehicles that
had had the 2018 Production Change. Surely this
would have been unnecessary if
the 2018 Production Change had itself been effective to remedy the Core Defect.
, TMCA submits that its attempt to extend the warranty of
certain Relevant Vehicles in August 2020 (in order to offer the 2020 Field
free of charge) was directed only to vehicles produced prior to June 2018
because the 2018 Production Change was effective. In
TMCA’s submission,
this obviated the need to offer the same extension to vehicles that had had the
2018 Production Change.
But Mr Nelson did not proffer this as an explanation for
the issuance of the warranty extension letter for vehicles produced prior
June 2018 only. A more plausible explanation is, that having regard to the three
year per 100,000km warranty that TMCA provided
in respect of new vehicles (until
1 January 2019), the warranty coverage in respect of most vehicles produced
prior to June 2018
would have expired (or would soon expire) by August 2020;
whereas the warranty coverage in respect of most vehicles produced after
2018 would not have expired (noting in particular that since 1 January 2019,
TMCA has provided a five year warranty for new
vehicles): see SAF [10].
55 Hence, even if, contrary to my view, it was open to TMCA to seek to
reagitate the effectiveness of the 2018 Production Change,
I would not be
satisfied that it was effective in remedying the Core Defect.
56 Finally, I should note for completeness that TMCA’s submission that
even if the Court finds, consistent with the referee’s
reports, that the
Core Defect was present in the Relevant Vehicles that had 2018 Production
Change, the Court should nevertheless
find that those vehicles experience the
Core Defect differently from other Relevant Vehicles, should too be rejected.
appreciated that the Core Defect was
in all Relevant
Vehicles, including vehicles produced with the 2018 Production Change, it must
also be accepted that those vehicles,
just like the Pre-MY2018 Production
Vehicles, malfunctioned when exposed to the High Speed Driving Pattern and had
an inherent propensity
to experience the associated consequences: AF [73], [75].
The referee’s conclusions concerning the nature of the Core Defect
consequences, and the Agreed Facts concerning the effect of the Core Defect on
Relevant Vehicles in which it is present,
in respect of
Relevant Vehicles.
57 It is highly regrettable that, despite the sensible approach to engaging
in the reference process and agreeing to the adoption
of the referee’s
reports, TMCA persisted with this rather arid dispute. Such a course was devoid
of merit and contrary to facilitating
the dictates of the overarching purpose in
of the Act. Nevertheless, this is a convenient segue into the next factual
issue in dispute: the nature of the consequences occasioned
by the Core Defect.
B.3.2 Did all Relevant Vehicles have a propensity to suffer
the consequences of the Core Defect?
parties are in dispute as to whether all the Relevant Vehicles had a propensity
to suffer from the Core Defect and the consequences
occasioned by the Core
Defect. There is also a debate as to the issue of fuel consumption. It is
convenient to first deal with the
overarching contention as to the consequences
occasioned by the Core Defect, before turning to the issue of increased fuel
consumption.
The Defect Consequences
the light of the referee’s conclusions and the Agreed Facts, it can be
said that if a Relevant Vehicle was exposed to
the High Speed Driving Pattern,
the Relevant Vehicle would experience one or more of the following consequences,
by reason of the
Core Defect (AF [75]):
(1) damage to the DOC;
(2) the flow of unoxidised fuel through the DPF and the emission of white smoke
from the vehicle’s exhaust during and immediately
regeneration;
(3) the emission of excessive white smoke and foul-smelling exhaust from the
vehicle’s exhaust during regeneration;
(4) partial or complete blockage of the DPF;
(5) the emission of foul-smelling exhaust from the exhaust pipe when the engine
was on during and immediately following automatic
regeneration;
(6) the need to have the Relevant Vehicle inspected, serviced and/or repaired by
a service engineer for the purpose of cleaning,
repairing or replacing the DPF,
DPF System (or components thereof);
(7) the need to have the Relevant Vehicle inspected, serviced and/or repaired
more regularly than would be required absent the Core
(8) the need to programme the engine control module (
) more often than
would be required absent the Core Defect;
(9) the display of DPF notifications on an excessive number of occasions and/or
for an excessive period of time;
(10) blockage of the fifth fuel injector in the Relevant Vehicles (
) due to carbon deposits on its tip;
(11) the Additional Injector causes deposits forming on the face of the DOC,
causing white smoke; and
(12) an increase in fuel consumption and decrease in fuel economy (Second
Referee’s Report (at [21], [28]–[29]); see
below (at [
(collectively, the
Defect Consequences
60 It seems that in written closing submissions, the applicants contend for a
slight variation of these consequences. No explanation
was provided as to why
the findings in the Agreed Facts should be departed from, and in any event,
there does not appear to be any
meaningful difference between the consequences
as outlined in the applicants’ closing submissions and those defined
61 TMCA submits that the referee did not find that all of the Defect
Consequences would occur during the High Speed Driving Pattern,
but rather, only
one or more of them in many instances. In TMCA’s submission, this is
evidenced by the referee’s conclusion
in his First Report (at [55]) that
of the Relevant Vehicles ... would have experienced one or
more of those consequences” if subjected to the High Speed Driving
(emphasis added). It is said that the referee did not seek to quantify the
extent to which each of the Defect Consequences
might be or was likely to
eventuate whenever the High Speed Driving Pattern was engaged in, given he
concluded (at [43]) that “[w]ith
the exception of the [Relevant Prado],
I am unable
to identify which of the Relevant Vehicles experienced
symptoms of the core defect during the Relevant Period” (emphasis added).
Further, it is said that some group members may not have driven in line with the
High Speed Driving Pattern and therefore may have
never been affected.
62 It may be accepted that each of the Relevant Vehicles did not
suffer from the Defect Consequences. However, I reject the
contention that only some, not “all”, of the Relevant Vehicles
to suffer one of the Defect Consequences if exposed to the
High Speed Driving Pattern. This proposition is clearly established by
referee’s conclusions in his First Report:
(1) as to the class of consequences associated with the Core Defect (see
(2) that (at [43]):
[the Core Defect] was a feature of all of the Relevant Vehicles during the
Relevant Period (at least in latent form) and
would result
in one or more
of the following consequences in vehicles exposed to the high-speed pattern
and/or which were the subject of the ineffective
countermeasures introduced by
the Respondent during the Relevant Period:
(a) excessive white smoke in exhaust during regeneration;
(b) foul odor [
] during regeneration; and/or
(c) DPF Notifications and MILs being displayed when the DPF became full as a
result of ineffective regeneration.
(Emphasis added).
(3) that (at [47]):
[n]umerous Toyota documents recording its investigations into what the
[r]espondent has called the ‘DPF issues’ describe
the following
mechanism(s) and physical manifestations of the core defect which, when a
vehicle was exposed to the high-speed pattern
and/or ineffective
countermeasures, led to defect consequences”;
(4) that (at [28]–[29]) “the Vehicle Defects likely have some
negative impact on fuel economy” such that “the
fuel consumption of
the Relevant Vehicles [is] increased and/or their fuel economy decreased”.
63 By reason of the fact that the Core Defect was
present in each Relevant Vehicle at the time it was supplied, each Relevant
had a propensity to experience one or more of the Defect Consequences.
This is because if the Relevant Vehicles were exposed to the
High Speed Driving
Pattern (a normal form of usage of the vehicles) the DPF System would
malfunction in the manner described above
(8)]), which in turn caused the vehicles
to experience one or more of the Defect Consequences described above (at [
64 Indeed, the likelihood or probability that any
given Relevant Vehicle would suffer from one or more Defect Consequences was
high. In April 2017, TMCA prepared a “Field Action
Proposal” form, in which TMCA sought permission from TMC to implement
“Customer Service Campaign” to address the DPF issues experienced by
Relevant Vehicles: Nelson Affidavit (at [91]);
T89.38–90.5. The purpose of
the Field Action Proposal form was “to demonstrate to TMC the level of
importance, severity
and potential impact upon guests” of the DPF issues
being experienced by the Relevant Vehicles: Nelson Affidavit (at [91]).
Field Action Proposal form included a statistical assessment of the proportion
of Relevant Vehicles that would “fail”
within five and 10 years of
service respectively (that is, would be the subject of a DPF-related complaint
concerning excessive white
smoke or DPF malfunction, indicated by the
illumination of the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (
) on the dashboard):
Nelson Affidavit (at [92]–[95]); T89.30–91.13. The analysis
indicated that 50 per cent of Relevant
Vehicles would fail after five years in
service, and 94 per cent would fail after 10 years in service:
T90.35–91.13.
65 As the evidence before the Court indicates,
TMCA’s forecasts in April 2017 were well founded. A large proportion of
Vehicles have in fact already experienced one or more of the Defect
Consequences within five years of service. This is borne out
records of warranty claims made in respect of some of the Relevant Vehicles: AF
[18]. As at 31 July 2021, at least
154,916 Relevant Vehicles have received
servicing related to issues with the DPF System: AF [186].
Increased fuel consumption
a subset of this factual dispute, the parties are in contest as to whether the
referee’s findings establish that fuel
consumption increased and fuel
economy decreased in all Relevant Vehicles.
67 TMCA submits that the referee’s conclusions do not establish that
fuel consumption increased and fuel economy decreased in
Vehicles. Relevantly, the referee noted in his Second Report that (at
[27]–[28]):
27. While the simple average of the mean fuel consumption increase estimates of
the vehicles in the Toyota Fuel Consumption Study
is 3%, more than half of the
vehicles are estimated to have no more than a marginal impact on fuel
consumption, as I expected in
my earlier report. I note, however, that the
driving patterns associated with the ECM downloads and the corresponding
regeneration/non-regeneration
distances reported in the TFCS are unknown and may
not be directly comparable to the driving pattern of the NEDC used for the Fuel
Consumption values from Type Approval, adding uncertainty to the estimates.
Further, the ECM downloads reported in the TFCS do not
represent a statistically
significant sample of any vehicle type or model.
28. Nonetheless, the estimates do suggest that the Vehicle Defects likely have
some negative impact of fuel economy in Affected Relevant
Vehicles and this
conclusion is further supported by the following additional considerations:
(a) the core defect and the impact of the core defect on regeneration frequency
and duration (as discussed in my first report);
(b) the Applicant’s affidavit evidence concerning the increased fuel use
of his vehicle during periods in which it was emitting
excessive white smoke;
(c) records of customer complaints concerning increased fuel consumption in
Relevant Vehicles.
(Citations omitted).
68 Further, TMCA accepts that by reference to the
11 vehicle Toyota Fuel Consumption Study (
), the referee concluded
that the vehicles in which the Core Defect was present suffered from increased
fuel consumption or decreased
fuel economy by reason of the Core Defect and
Defect Consequences. However, it is said that it was made plain in the Second
Report that whether or not each vehicle
experienced an increase in fuel
consumption depended on,
, the driving style and pattern of the
individual driver (at [30]):
30. As my observations at 27 above suggest, I am unable to answer the second
part of question 3(a) based on the materials available
to me. In particular,
I cannot provide a reliable single estimate for increased fuel consumption to
be applied globally for all Relevant Vehicles
for the reasons identified in
that paragraph and the following further reasons:
(a) as discussed in my first report, the level of increased regeneration
affecting each of the Relevant Vehicles will be
dependent on a range of
variables, including the driving style and pattern of the individual driver
(b) it appears likely that the driving style of the owners of the vehicles in
the TFCS may explain much or all of the significant
variation of fuel
consumption results among the individual vehicles in my analysis of the TFCS as:
(i) the two vehicles with the highest increase in fuel consumption in the
sample were the two manual transmission models; and
(ii) of the 10 remaining vehicles in the sample (all of which have automatic
transmissions), 7 had
only de minimis
fuel consumption variations within
+/-2% of the Type Approval result for that vehicle (with the remaining 3 showing
increased fuel
consumption of 5-6% from the Type Approval result).
(Emphasis added).
69 TMCA submits that given the applicants did not pursue a case based on
excess fuel consumption at the initial trial, and because
the referee could not
report on how much fuel consumption increased on an aggregate basis, there is no
evidence before the Court
increased in the Relevant Vehicles, or indeed the extent to which
the Relevant Vehicles experienced such an increase.
70 I reject this submission for the following two reasons.
, TMCA’s submission that the referee did not conclude
that all of the Relevant Vehicles experienced an increase in fuel consumption
incorrect. In the Second Referee’s Report, the referee was presented the
following question:
3. Is the fuel consumption of the Relevant Vehicles increased and/or their fuel
economy decreased, by reason of:
Vehicle Defects and/or Vehicle Defect Consequences to which a “D” or
“C” was allocated in Annexure F
of the Referee’s Report and,
if so, by how much; and/or
Supplementary Question 1 is answered “yes”, the Relevant
Vehicles’ reliance on Automatic Regeneration and Manual
Regeneration,
rather than Passive Regeneration, to regenerate the DPF and, if so, by how
72 The referee’s answer to question 3(a) was ‘yes’”:
see [29]. While it is true that the referee was unable
to determine the answer
to the second part of the question (“by how much”) on the materials
at his disposal, that does
not alter his conclusion in relation to the first
part of the question, or his finding in the First Referee’s Report that
Core Defect did “have some negative impact on fuel economy” in
the Relevant Vehicles: see [28].
, to the extent it is said the “[a]pplicants [did]
not pursue a case based on excess fuel consumption at the initial trial”,
that submission should too should be rejected. The applicants do contend that a
consequence of the Core Defect was that fuel consumption
increased, and that
this is relevant in a number of respects, including to assessing: (a) whether
the Relevant Vehicles were of acceptable
quality at the time of supply, having
regard to the class of consequences associated with the Core Defect (which was
present in all
Relevant Vehicles); and (b) the amount of the reduction in value
of the Relevant Vehicles resulting from the Core Defect.
, insofar as TMCA is to be
understood as accepting that the class of consequences associated with the Core
Defect included that “the
fuel consumption of the Relevant Vehicles
increased and/or their fuel economy decreased”, but not accepting that
every single
vehicle in fact experienced increased fuel consumption, then
TMCA’s submission, for present purposes, is not really to the
the initial trial, the applicants seek damages on behalf of group members for
the reduction in value resulting from the
defect under s 272(1)(a) of the
ACL (in which case it is not necessary to prove which individual vehicles
experienced which specific
consequences and to what extent), not under
s 272(1)(b) for the cost of the additional fuel actually consumed by each
Relevant Vehicle
as a result of the Core Defect. This is because the applicants
accept that damages for the costs of the additional fuel actually
consumed would
need to be determined on an individualised basis. The only caveat to this
comment is that Mr Williams and DCS
seek damages of this type. I
address this aspect of the claim separately below: see [
B.3.3 What was the significance of the Core Defect and the
Defect Consequences?
parties dispute the significance of the Core Defect and the Defect Consequences.
76 A subset of this contention is that the Core Defect was a defect of the
, not a defect of the entire vehicle. In making this
submission, TMCA places reliance on two passages of the First Referee’s
Report which state (at [8] and [38], emphasis added):
was defective for the whole of the
Relevant Period. The core defect
was that the
designed to function effectively during all reasonably expected conditions of
normal operation and use in the Australian
market”; and
(2) “[a]s explained below, the
was defective for the
whole of the Relevant Period”.
77 The distinction is important, it is said, because the Court is required to
assess whether the
that was purchased was defective, and the group
members did not purchase a
– rather, they purchased a
HiLux, Prado or Fortuner vehicle.
78 Further, TMCA advances the following submissions which it says militate
against the significance of the Core Defect and the Defect
Consequences:
(1) none of the Defect Consequences affect the operation of the Relevant
Vehicles (the ability to get from A to B safely) and they
remained able to be
driven in all environments;
(2) the DPF System is not essential to the operation of the Relevant Vehicles;
(3) it is not suggested that the problems with the DPF System caused any safety
(4) notwithstanding the Core Defect, the Relevant Vehicles operated in a
non-defective manner and the condition of each vehicle as
a whole was
“indisputably sound”.
79 TMCA’s attempt to downplay the significance of the Core Defect and
the Defect Consequences does not withstand scrutiny.
, the DPF System performs a vital
function in the Relevant Vehicles and any attempt to divorce issues with the DPF
system from the
Relevant Vehicles is entirely superficial. As TMCA itself
submitted, the DPF System is in place to ensure compliance with emissions
AF [39]. If a vehicle does not comply with the applicable rules, it is in breach
of a range of statutory requirements, including
that it cannot be registered by
a state or territory registering authority for use, or driven, on Australian
roads. It does not matter
that the applicants have not sought to prove that by
reason of the Core Defect, the Relevant Vehicles in fact failed to comply with
emissions standards. The point is that, contrary to the thrust of TMCA’s
submissions, the DPF System is a critically important
component of the Relevant
vehicles, the proper functioning of which is likely to be of concern to a
reasonable consumer.
, even adopting the starting point that the acceptable
quality of a brand new motor vehicle costing around $50,000 is to be measured
only by reference to whether it is still capable of being used to drive from A
to B, the consequences of the Core Defect are such
as to substantially interfere
with the normal use and operation of the Relevant Vehicles. Take, for example,
the following implication
of the Core Defect:
(1) by reason of the Core Defect, if the Relevant Vehicles were exposed to the
High Speed Driving Pattern, regeneration events failed
to remove sufficient
particulate matter from the DPF to prevent the DPF from becoming or remaining
full or blocked (AF [73(b)]);
(2) when the DPF becomes full or blocked, the vehicle “warns” the
driver of this fact by displaying DPF notifications
and/or illuminating the MIL
on the vehicle’s dash and consistently with instructions in the
Owner’s Manual, owners are
directed to take the Relevant Vehicle to an
authorised dealership for unscheduled maintenance to have the DPF System
inspected, repaired,
or replaced (First Referee’s Report (at [43(c)],
[47(b)(iv)(A)], [55(b)], [56], [63]–[64]));
(3) if the driver continues to operate the Relevant Vehicle despite those
warnings, the ECM causes the vehicle to go into Limp Mode,
whereby the ECM will
prevent the vehicle from going into fifth gear and will limit acceleration
(Nelson Affidavit (at [76]); D2FASOC
(at [17(b)(xvi)])); and
(4) if Limp Mode occurs, the vehicle must be taken to a dealer and various TMCA
instruction materials state that damage may be caused
to a Relevant Vehicle, or
an accident may occur, if a Relevant Vehicle continues to be driven when the DPF
warning light is flashing
or the DPF system warning message appears.
82 TMCA submits that Limp Mode is not a consequence of the Core Defect, but
rather a consequence of improper usage. This is superficial.
One of the Defect
Consequences is triggering DPF notifications to the driver: AF [75(i)]. Once
those notifications appear, the driver
must take their vehicle in for servicing
to address the problem, or the vehicle will go into Limp Mode. What TMCA’s
appears to imply is that if a driver gets to the point of
experiencing Limp Mode triggered by the Core Defect, it is the fault of
driver. That submission should be rejected.
83 This also casts further light on TMCA’s submission that the Relevant
Vehicles are not defective because they are still capable
of getting people from
A to B. Is one to limp from A to B unless they respond promptly to the warnings
that are triggered by the
Core Defect? I reject any contention that the Core
Defect does not impact upon or interfere with the operation of the Relevant
or that the Relevant Vehicles continued to be suitable for use in all
driving conditions, including the High Speed Driving Pattern,
even with the Core
Defect present.
, while I accept that no case was advanced on the basis that
the Core Defect gave rise to any issue of safety, plumes of dense white
are hardly conducive to a safe driving environment. TMCA’s contemporaneous
records of complaints made by Mr Williams
Williams’ view that the white smoke entering the cabin of the car was
“dangerous”:
First Williams Affidavit (at [173]). Mr Williams was
not challenged on this evidence. Needless to say, I place minimal weight on
factor in reaching my conclusion.
, tens of thousands of customer complaints illustrate the
obvious point that the Defect Consequences are not trivial. They have a
significant impact upon consumers’ use and enjoyment of the Relevant
Vehicles: see, for example, those referred to at [
] below. Indeed, TMCA ignores Mr
Williams’ unchallenged evidence of the lived experience of the excessive
white smoke issue:
First Williams Affidavit (at [117]–[119]).
, TMCA’s attempt to downplay the significance of the
Core Defect is inconsistent with its contemporaneous conduct and internal
communications. TMCA had significant concerns about how the problems experienced
by the Relevant Vehicles would impact upon TMCA’s
brand and reputation; it
apprehended that the issues experienced by the Relevant Vehicles were of a
serious nature and materially
affected consumers’ use and enjoyment of the
Relevant Vehicles
. For example, the Global
Registration Notice issued on 31 August 2016, in explaining that a
countermeasure was “urgently necessary”,
referred to “several
customers getting stopped by the police, and also other road users”.
B.3.4 Market Awareness of the Core Defect and Defect
Consequences
key issue in dispute between the parties is whether (and to what extent)
consumers were aware of the Core Defect and Defect Consequences
Relevant Period.
88 The relevance of this fact to TMCA’s case arises as follows. Mr
Stockton gave evidence that he analysed the secondary market
data from the
vehicle valuation and information website RedBook, and vehicle auctions both for
Relevant Vehicles and the vehicles
he identified as comparator vehicles: First
Stockton Report (at [254]–[260]). He compared resale prices as a
percentage of
manufacturers’ suggested retail price (
Relevant Vehicles and comparator vehicles over time, including through
regression analysis: First Stockton Report (at tab DVI
2). Mr Stockton found
that the retained value of Relevant Vehicles in the resale market exceeded that
of comparator vehicles: First
Stockton Report (at [262(a)]). He also found that
value retention of Relevant Vehicles was higher in 2020 and
2021 than in earlier periods: First Stockton Report (at [262(b)]). Mr
determined these results to be inconsistent with a mature market response to
information about the Core Defect and in part
counterintuitive, and so did not
finalise his analysis and instead investigated whether the market was maturely
informed of the Core
Defect: First Stockton Report (at [250], [265]).
89 TMCA seizes upon the preliminary conclusions reached by Mr Stockton as
proof that:
(1) a reasonable consumer fully acquainted with the Core Defect and Defect
Consequences would nevertheless regard the Relevant Vehicles
as being of
acceptable quality; and
(2) the presence of the Core Defect in the Relevant Vehicles did not result in a
reduction in the value of the Relevant Vehicles
at the time they were supplied.
90 A critical premise in TMCA’s reasoning is that at some point during
the Relevant Period, the market became fully informed
of the Core Defect and
Defect Consequences, such that the secondary market data analysed by Mr Stockton
should be taken as reflecting
an informed market response to the Core Defect and
Defect Consequences.
91 TMCA submits that there are numerous means by
which information was available to market participants in respect of the Core
in the Relevant Vehicles, namely:
(1) From February 2016, owners of the Relevant Vehicles took their vehicles to
dealers in respect of the problems and dealers sought
to have the problems
fixed. Between February 2016 and September 2018, TMCA received at least 4,000
Dealer Product Reports and more
than 100,000 warranty claims: AF [149], [155].
It is said the total number of those owners amounts to a substantial volume of
in the market.
(2) The various dealers received formal communications from TMCA in relation to
the DPF issues and the fixes that were attempted
at different points in time:
SAF [8]. TMCA also delivered presentations to regional offices and dealers: AF
[124]. TMCA submits that
there is no evidence to the effect that dealers kept
this information from anyone.
(3) In March 2018, TMCA received enquiries from
dealers about a social media post which suggested that TMCA had announced a
campaign “to fix failing DPFs”. That post was not correct,
but the fact that it referred to a recall, it is said, suggested
a more serious
problem than was actually present.
(4) Problems with Toyota DPFs were the subject of discussion in
“multiple” web forums by around late 2016 or early 2017
July 2018 (prior to any mention of a class action), there were various media
reports about issues with Relevant Vehicles:
(5) From around December 2018, there were media reports of the possibility of a
class action in respect of DPF issues and since these
proceedings were commenced
on 26 July 2019 a number of articles have reported on the proceedings: AF
(6) On 5 September 2019, TMCA launched a webpage dedicated to the DPF System and
this litigation which, between September 2019 and
April 2020, was viewed between
2,713 to 4,544 times per month: AF [114]; Jones Affidavit (at [11]).
(7) There is evidence that some purchasers purchased
a vast number of vehicles over the period (it is common ground that 16,961
purchasers purchased more than one Relevant Vehicle). For example, Mr
Berndt refers to companies with the acronym “BHP”
contained in their
name being responsible for the purchase of around 1,700 vehicles: Berndt
Affidavit (at [9]). The first of those
purchases was in November 2015 and the
last was in April 2020. Although the Court is not in a position to understand
the way that
the BHP companies share information among themselves, it is said
one can readily infer that if the DPF defect consequences manifested
of vehicles purchased by BHP early in the period, that would affect the purchase
decisions of BHP later in the period.
92 While I accept that there were articles concerning potential issues with
Toyota vehicles over the Relevant Period, it cannot seriously
be said that I can
be satisfied that the secondary market was aware of the Core Defect and Defect
Consequences. As Mr Stockton put
it, and as I accept, there would need to be an
awareness generally on the part of consumers in the resale market of a
forward-looking propensity in Relevant Vehicles before it could be
said the market was informed: T285.1–9, T293.23–294.16,
T296.22–36. TMCA contends that this does not accord with common sense,
because unknown future problems would have a greater
adverse impact on
consumers. I disagree. The fact that a consumer is aware of a past problem in
one vehicle does not mean they would
associate this with a systemic problem in
all vehicles going forward.
93 Further, I reject TMCA’s contention that the Court “would
accept the market data as reflecting an informed market,
unless shown
otherwise”. The very existence of the Core Defect as an objective fact is
something that TMCA was still disputing
up to and during the reference process
in 2021. Even after the reference process, TMCA continues to dispute whether the
Core Defect
was present in the 2018 Production Change Vehicles as a matter of
objective fact. It would be artificial, and a subversion of the
evidentiary
onus, to start with an
assumption that the market must
nevertheless have known the truth about the Core Defect from 2015, and then ask
whether the applicants
have disproved that assumption.
94 Beyond these general comments, it is necessary to say something about each
of the categories of information relied upon to evidence
market awareness.
Print and online media
95 There are several
issues with the print and online media relied upon by TMCA.
, none of the articles published prior to October 2020
disclose that the Relevant Vehicles are defective in the way concluded by
and found by the court. As regards to an article dated 23 October 2020,
by the time that article was published, an effective fix
had become available
(as is explained in the article). Even if one assumes that the information in
this article was absorbed by the
resale market and reflected in market prices
for used Relevant Vehicles from October 2020, it says nothing about the
reduction in
value of those vehicles resulting from the defect at the time they
were initially supplied, when no effective fix was available.
, there is no evidence or reason to infer that the resale
market for Relevant Vehicles is an “efficient market” in the
that information published on a trade website or in a newspaper should be taken
to be absorbed by the resale market and reflected
in the market price of the
Relevant Vehicles.
, although certain of the articles refer to problems
experienced by certain of the Relevant Vehicles, they also contain statements
from TMCA to the effect that the problems referred to have been remedied, or
that an effective remedy is at least available. For
example, two of the articles
contain statements such as:
(1) “[TMCA] apologised for the inconvenience to affected customers and
confirmed the above technical issues are being addressed”;
(2) “[i]n a statement, [TMCA] said it ‘launched the latest in a
series of initiatives, a customer service campaign, to
resolve the potential DPF
issue’ in October. ‘All customers with potentially affected vehicles
have been, or are in the
process of being, contacted by letter and are requested
to make contact with their closest/preferred Toyota dealer,’ the company
99 It is arguable that a reasonable consumer reading these articles would
understand that the problems or issues with the vehicles
referred to in the
articles have been or are able to be fixed. But this was not the case.
, insofar as certain of the articles refer to details of
allegations made in this legal proceeding, it should be recalled that TMCA
since the commencement of the proceedings,
the core allegation
that the Relevant Vehicles are defective in design and have an inherent
propensity to experience adverse consequences.
It is curious to submit that a
reasonable consumer reading articles describing allegations made in this
proceeding would understand
from such articles that the Relevant Vehicles are
defective in the manner alleged, in circumstances where the allegation has been
consistently denied by TMCA.
, and while I place minimal, if any, weight on this factor,
it is true to say that in carrying out TMCA’s “DPF Consumer
Program”, TMCA has not denied a consumer redress on the basis that the
consumer ought to have known about the Core
Defect and Defect Consequences when
they purchased the vehicle, having regard to statements made in print and online
media about
problems with the vehicles: see the evidence of Mr Nelson at
T103.42–46.
Knowledge derived from prior ownership
also appears to contend that consumers may have become fully informed about the
Core Defect and Defect Consequences by reason
of their prior ownership or
experience of a Relevant Vehicle. This contention is also problematic.
, knowledge that one’s vehicle has experienced
problematic behaviours (for example, the emission of excessive white smoke or
foul-smelling exhaust) does not equate to knowledge that the root cause of those
problems or issues is that the DPF System in the
vehicle is defective in design.
Nor does knowledge that one particular vehicle acquired in the past experienced
certain problems
associated with the DPF System translate into an awareness that
a new vehicle acquired at a later date will have the same underlying
, even assuming that some consumers acquired knowledge of
the Core Defect through their own experience of owning a Relevant Vehicle,
is nothing to attribute this knowledge to the market
. During Mr
Williams’ cross-examination, there was some faint suggestion that such
knowledge might be disseminated throughout
the market by way of “pub
chats” or ad hoc carpark conversations: T65.20–21; T61.1–13.
While TMCA accepts
that, in isolation, Mr Williams’ evidence in this
respect would not take matters very far, Mr Williams’ evidence that
discussed these matters with other Prado drivers is said to be a useful real
world example of the dissemination of the issues.
While I accept schooners were
no doubt downed over frustrated conversations about car issues, it cannot
seriously be said that the
exchange of information in this context resulted in a
fully informed resale market.
, the number of group members who acquired two or more
Relevant Vehicles during the Relevant Period is relatively miniscule. On the
basis of TMCA’s evidence on this issue, there were 185,816 unique
purchasers of the 264,170 “new” Relevant Vehicles,
of which 16,961
unique purchasers purchased two or more vehicles: Berndt Affidavit (at [6],
[9]). Of those unique purchasers, 582
purchased more than 20 vehicles, and five
purchased more than 500 vehicles: Berndt Affidavit (at [9],
[12]‑–[13]).
Disclosure by dealers
also postulates that the market may have become informed about the Core Defect
and Defect Consequences through information
disseminated by dealers. The
hypothesis advanced by TMCA is that dealers may have been informing individual
consumers about the Core
Defect and Defect Consequences at the point of sale.
There are a number of issues with this submission.
, as TMCA accepts, there is no evidence to support this
assertion. TMCA itself sold 7,316 Relevant Vehicles directly to consumers
did not lead evidence of instances in which it disclosed the Core Defect to
consumers at the point of purchase.
, this assertion is inconsistent with TMCA’s
admission that it failed to disclose the Core Defect or Defect Consequences
the Relevant Period: see [
]. It is also inconsistent with the
admitted fact that, throughout the Relevant Period, TMCA represented that the
Relevant Vehicles
were, in their design and manufacturing, not defective, of
good quality, reliable, durable and suitable for use in any driving environment:
, TMCA’s hypothesis is contrary to the evidence given
by Mr Nelson, who described the way in which TMCA controlled the information
conveyed by dealers to consumers about the Relevant Vehicles, namely that:
(1) dealers in the TMCA network are encouraged to raise with TMCA any technical
issues they encounter at an early stage. Those dealers
then rely on TMCA to give
them guidance about how to manage those issues (T74.44–75.6;
T76.17–27);
(2) this arrangement is adopted to try and manage technical issues in a uniform
way across the network of dealerships (T75.8–9)
and ensure that dealers
respond to technical issues in a way that is consistent with TMCA’s advice
(T75.43‑–45);
(3) TMCA has a contractual relationship with its dealers which requires them to
comply with TMCA’s communications concerning
technical issues, including
“bulletins”, “all dealer service letters” (
and “technical newsflashes”. On occasion, the ADSLs would be
structured in a “Q&A” format, intended
to anticipate the kind of
questions that guests might ask dealers about the technical issue the subject of
the ADSL in order to “encourage
[dealers] to manage the guests in a
consistent way by answering these kinds of questions in a consistent way”
(T77.10‑–78.7;
T79.25–46; T80.9‑–81.8).
110 Mr Nelson’s evidence is supported by
contemporaneous documentary evidence, which shows that dealers sought and relied
the “Q&As” provided by TMCA to determine what information
they could provide to guests in respect of the DPF
. Generally speaking, throughout the Relevant
Period, dealers were informed by TMCA that, insofar as TMCA had identified
issues with
certain of the Relevant Vehicles: (a) TMCA had developed a fix for
those issues; (b) dealers were to apply the fix to any affected
vehicles in
stock (that is, unsold vehicles); and (c) the application of the fix to such
vehicles would solve the issues otherwise
affecting the vehicles: see e.g.
T92.24‑–93.21; T94.25–95.5; T95.27–46; T96.2–41;
T.97.4–98.23.
Hence, on the basis of the information provided to the
dealers by TMCA, they were never selling defective vehicles to consumers.
111 Indeed, if a consumer purchasing a new vehicle asked whether the vehicle
to be purchased was affected by the DPF issues the subject
of this legal
proceeding, dealers were instructed to tell them that they were not. That was
contrary to the true position (even if
TMCA and its dealers may have been
labouring under a mistaken belief that the problem had been solved). As the
referee concluded,
the Core Defect was present in all Relevant Vehicles supplied
during the Relevant Period (that is, up to 23 April 2020). Further,
the materials provided to dealers by TMCA disclosed to dealers the nature of the
Core Defect as concluded by the referee.
112 In the light of the above evidence, the
suggestion that dealers were nevertheless disclosing the Core Defect to
consumers at the
point of purchase is fanciful. Such dealers would have been
acting in breach of their contractual obligations to TMCA and against
commercial interests in selling Relevant Vehicles. Further, such dealers would
have had to have acquired an understanding
of the Core Defect that was not
explained in any of the bulletins provided by TMCA to dealers for the purpose of
educating dealers
TMCA’s ‘DPF Webpage’
113 Finally,
TMCA contends that one of “the means by which information [about the Core
Defect] was available to market participants”
was a webpage launched by
TMCA in September 2019 concerning this litigation. But there was no disclosure
on the webpage of any defect
in the Relevant Vehicles, let alone disclosure of
the consequences of any defect. While there is a reference to a “DPF
the nature of the “DPF issue” is neither described nor
explained. Further, the webpage explained that only vehicles produced
June 2018 were affected by the DPF issue, which was false. I am not satisfied
that the webpage was a means by which the
market came to be aware of the Core
Defect or Defect Consequences.
Conclusions on market awareness of Defect Consequences
114 Overall,
I am satisfied that the market was not apprised of the Core Defect and the
Defect Consequences. It will be necessary
to say something further about the
secondary market data below.
115 For completeness, before moving on, I should say something about
Bramhill v Edwards
[2004] 2 Lloyd’s Law Reports 653, upon which
TMCA places some emphasis. That case concerned a buyer who had purchased a motor
for a maximum width of 100 inches. The buyer brought
proceedings for breach of s
Sale of Goods Act 1979
(UK), which contained broadly similar
consumer guarantees as s 54 of the ACL. Relevantly, the primary judge concluded
that, notwithstanding
there was some evidence which indicated that the
authorities turned a blind eye to that road rule, including articles in the
RV Magazine of December 1998, the American Motor-home Club magazine of
1999 and various magazine advertisements in the period prior
to June 1999, a
reasonable person would still not have regarded the vehicle to be of acceptable
quality. As to this finding, Auld
LJ (with whom Thomas and Jacob LJJ agreed)
concluded (at 660 [38]):
In my view, there was ample evidence, albeit of a secondary and circumstantial
nature, to which the Judge referred in pars. 38, 39
and 40 of his judgment, on
which he was entitled to conclude that the authorities had turned a blind eye to
wide-spread breaches
of the Regulations and that that was well-known to
enthusiasts for such vehicles in this specialist trade.
116 The Court of Appeal held that the reasonable buyer would be attributed
with knowledge of those matters and would therefore regard
the motor home as
satisfactory: see 660–661 [38]–[42].
117 TMCA submits that
proposition that the evidence required to support a finding that the market is
informed need not be extensive or precise.
But no overarching principle can be
discerned from the Court of Appeal’s reasoning.
a factual finding made in entirely different and bespoke circumstances, with a
suggestion that the primary judge had misapplied
the statutory test: see 660
[39]. Ultimately, the reasoning in
does not bear upon my view
that on the evidence adduced, ignorance of the Core Defect and Defect
Consequences was profound and widespread,
and I am satisfied the market was not
B.3.5 Mr Williams and the Relevant Prado
is also convenient here to make a number of findings in relation to the Relevant
Prado, which are largely undisputed. These
findings will inform a number of
aspects of the individual claim of DCS.
119 Mr Williams lives in Redland Bay, a semi-rural area south-east of
Brisbane in Queensland, with his wife and four children: First
Affidavit (at [4]–[5]). He is employed as a motor vehicle accident
assessor by DCS, a company of which he is the sole
director and secretary and
the only permanent employee: First Williams Affidavit (at [6]–[7]). DCS
provides loss assessment
services to Australian Accident Management Commercial
): First Williams Affidavit (at [17]). Mr Williams’
work involves travelling to job sites to inspect and assess damaged vehicles:
First Williams Affidavit (at [18]).
120 The Relevant Prado is a 2016 Toyota Prado GXL 2.8L Diesel Automatic. It
is a five door wagon, its colour is glacier white, and
it was purchased with
professional window tint. It was purchased on 8 April 2016 from Southside Toyota
in Woolloongabba, Queensland:
AF [77]; First Williams Affidavit (at [8], [78]).
Purchase decision
early 2016, Mr Williams determined to trade in his vehicle at the time (a Toyota
Kluger MY12 KX-R Petrol Wagon) and purchase
a new vehicle, consistent with his
usual practice of replacing his primary vehicle approximately every three to
four years: First
Williams Affidavit (at [31]–[32]). Mr Williams
considered purchasing, and researched, at least four vehicles: the Toyota Prado
(both diesel and petrol models), the Ford Ranger (dual cab model) and the Nissan
Patrol: First Williams Affidavit (at [47], [59]–[64]).
122 In deciding which new vehicle to purchase, Mr
Williams placed importance upon, among other things, the vehicle being
comfortable,
able to drive in all conditions, and reliable in the sense that it
performs consistently without fault and does not require servicing
its normal recommend manufacturer’s servicing milestones; he also placed
importance on fuel economy, safety, re-sale
value and the vehicle’s looks:
First Williams Affidavit (at [34]–[35]). These factors were important to
Mr Williams:
... because [he] intended to use the new vehicle primarily for work and my work
involves frequent driving, often over long distances
and in a variety of driving
conditions including city and suburban roads, highways, and country roads. As
such, [he] wanted to ensure
that I was driving a vehicle that was reliable,
comfortable, safe, fuel efficient, and performed well in all conditions.
123 The Toyota Prado was included among the vehicles Mr Williams was
considering purchasing because he was of the view that Toyota
vehicles are high
quality, reliable, and safe, and that, in addition, Prados are tough, powerful,
comfortable, and luxurious vehicles:
First Williams Affidavit (at [49(c)]). His
view in this regard was based upon TMCA’s advertising: First Williams
(at [49(c)]).
124 In giving consideration to purchasing the
Toyota Prado in particular, in early 2016, Mr Williams visited TMCA’s
and reviewed materials including:
(1) A brochure published on the website which contained information about, and
described features of, and displayed photographs of,
the models in the Toyota
Prado range. Mr Williams did not download or otherwise keep a copy of the
brochure but gave evidence that
the “Prado e-Brochure” looks
consistent with the brochure he reviewed in early 2016 (First Williams Affidavit
(at [51]–[52]).
(2) Pages on the website promoting the Toyota Prado range, which included
information about the vehicles and their features, and
displayed photographs of
the vehicles. Mr Williams did not download or otherwise keep a copy of the
webpages, but gave evidence that
a compilation of webpages from a digital
archive of the TMCA website looks consistent with the webpages he reviewed in
early 2016:
First Williams Affidavit (at [51]–[52]).
(3) The technical specifications for the models in the Toyota Prado range
published on the website, including in respect of the vehicle’s
torque, power, transmission, and fuel economy. Mr Williams did not download or
otherwise keep a copy of the technical specifications,
but gave evidence that a
digital archive copy looks consistent with the technical specifications he
reviewed in early 2016: First
Williams Affidavit (at [51]–[52]).
125 In the course of his research, Mr Williams decided that the Toyota Prado
GXL with a 2.8L engine and automatic transmission was
the model which best
suited his needs and budget: First Williams Affidavit (at [55]). He discounted
the GXL Petrol Automatic model
primarily because he formed the view that it was
likely to achieve significantly worse fuel economy than the GXL Diesel Automatic
model, and he would therefore incur higher fuel costs over time: First Williams
Affidavit (at [56]).
126 In around March 2016, Mr Williams determined to purchase the Relevant
Prado. This decision was made in reliance upon the materials
Mr Williams
reviewed, and the views he formed on the basis of those materials, particularly
that: (1) the vehicle was a “high
quality” vehicle; and (2) the
vehicle had the characteristics that he was looking for, being those set out
above (at [
]), including that the
vehicle was suitable for highway driving, was reliable and durable, was
comfortable, would perform consistently
without fault and would not require
servicing outside of its regular, scheduled servicing: First Williams Affidavit
(at [65]–[66]).
127 Mr Williams was not aware, prior to the purchase of the Relevant Prado,
of problems with the DPF System in the Relevant Vehicles.
Mr Williams’
evidence is that he “would not have purchased the Prado if [he] had known
the issues [he] would experience
with the vehicle. Instead, [he] would have
purchased a different vehicle”: First Williams Affidavit (at [224]).
Purchase, trade-in and financing
late March and early April 2016, Mr Williams made arrangements for the purchase
of a Toyota Prado GXL Diesel with a 2.8L engine
and automatic transmission from
Southside Toyota. The Relevant Prado was purchased on 8 April 2016: AF [77];
First Williams Affidavit
(at [68]–[77]).
129 The purchase costs for the Relevant Prado were as follows (AF [80]):
Professional Window Tint 2 Windows
Registration Fee
Compulsory Third Party
Dealer Delivery
Stamp Duty (calculated on $62,300.00)
130 It is common ground that the vehicle was purchased by DCS.
131 Upon purchase of the Relevant Prado, Mr Williams traded-in his Toyota
Kluger for a trade-in price of $17,000: First Williams Affidavit
(at [83]). As
at 8 April 2016, there was $26,205.62 remaining on a loan for the Kluger, the
purchase of which had been financed through
Esanda Finance Corporation Limited:
First Williams Affidavit (at [83]). The trade-in price for the Kluger was
deducted from the outstanding
balance of the loan amount, leaving a shortfall of
$9,205.62 remaining on the loan for the Kluger: First Williams Affidavit (at
132 On 8 April 2016, DCS entered into a Business Vehicle Loan agreement with
Toyota Finance for a period of 60 months, with 59 monthly
payments of
approximately $1,067.43 and a final residual payment at the end of the lease of
$20,774.23: AF [79], [82]. The balance
of the loan was paid on or about 23
October 2020: AF [86]; First Williams Affidavit (at [100]).
Use of the Relevant Prado
Williams describes his use of the Relevant Prado in detail in his evidence:
First Williams Affidavit (at [23], [105]–[113]).
From April 2016 to
September 2019, Mr Williams mainly drove the Relevant Prado to and from job
sites. This involved driving on a
mix of highways, and regional, suburban and
residential roads. The Relevant Prado was also used for short trips to the
on weekends for family trips, such as to the Gold Coast and to the
Problems with the Relevant Prado
Relevant Prado developed problems relating to the DPF System soon after it was
purchased: AF [88]. Mr Williams’ evidence
makes plain that these problems
are not trivial. They have had a substantial impact upon his use and enjoyment
of the vehicle.
Excessive white smoke and foul-smelling exhaust
135 Mr Williams describes
his first experience with his vehicle emitting foul-smelling, white smoke, which
occurred in around late
2016, in the following terms (at [117]–[118]):
On this occasion, I had stopped [the Relevant Prado] at a set of traffic lights
and was idling, when the engine revs began to lift
to about approximately 1,100
to 1,200 rpm and a massive cloud of white smoke began to plume out of the
I observed this white smoke through the rear-view and side mirrors of [the
Relevant Prado]. The white smoke was dense, so that while
I could see through
the edges of the smoke cloud, I could not see through the middle of the smoke
cloud. The cloud of smoke was about
as high as [the Relevant Prado] and while I
was sitting at the lights spread across approximately two lanes of traffic.
At the time, I had the windows down and could smell the white smoke. The smoke
did not smell like smoke from fire, but rather had
a strong, acidic, chemical
136 Just weeks later, the issue occurred again, in similar circumstances,
causing a similar density and spread of the smoke, and a
strong acidic, chemical
smell which would enter the vehicle, even when the windows were closed (at
I recall that when this second instance of [the Relevant Prado] emitting white
smoke occurred, I again felt surprised, but more so
angry at what had occurred
and worried that there was something mechanically wrong with [the Relevant
Prado]. I had spent a lot of
money buying [the Relevant Prado] and was concerned
that I had brought [
] a “lemon”.
137 The “white smoke” issue became more frequent, occurring a
couple of times a week: First Williams Affidavit (at [126]).
By around February
2017, it was occurring almost daily: First Williams Affidavit (at [135(a)]).
138 In July 2017, at an unscheduled service on account of DPF issues, the DPF
in the Relevant Prado was replaced: First Williams Affidavit
(at [142], [144]).
This, however, did not resolve the issue.
139 On or shortly before 19 April 2018, after two further services, the
Relevant Prado suffered a “particularly bad instance”
emission of white smoke: First Williams Affidavit (at [152]). Mr Williams had
his family in the vehicle with the windows down
when a substantial amount of
white smoke started to blow from the exhaust: Williams (at [153]). The smoke and
its chemical smell
surrounded the family. Mr Williams felt sick from the amount
of smoke and the chemical smell, and recalls, “we were all coughing
the smoke and ... from their facial expressions, it looked as though the smoke
was also making my wife and children feel sick”:
First Williams Affidavit
(at [153]).
140 Following this incident, on 19 April 2018, Mr Williams sent an email
complaint to Oldmac Toyota in the following terms (at [157]–[158],
[The Relevant Prado] is blowing so much white smoke, it is starting to make my
wife and kids sick, the fumes are coming into the
car. The car does a burn off
at the lights or when you pull up and the smell is getting on her cloths
], hair and the trim stinks as well. If you think you can’t
been back to
you and the DPF replaced. This car is using lots of fuel as well. I will soon
park [the Relevant Prado] and call Toyota
Finance to come and take the Car, I
have had it.
141 On 19 April 2018, Mr Williams also lodged the following complaint with
TMCA (at [159]):
Hi, could you please tell me who I send a complaint to in relation to my 2016
Prado with a DPF problem, the smoke is killing my family.
It has been replaced
and it is still doing it. I keep getting told by the dealer that it will blow
smoke. Come on, I do not see other
cars fitted with DPF blowing smoke like the
2.8 Toyota range.
142 On 23 April 2018, Mr Williams received a telephone call from someone at
TMCA in response to the 19 April 2018 complaint. TMCA’s
record of this
conversation includes (at [162]):
] started blowing smoke quite badly - started happening at
30,000/ 40,000kms when smoke started to appear- went to Oldmac Toyota and
alerted them of the issue- already checked the system had it checked 5x for the
problems with DPF - Oldmac Toyota replaced DPF –
it’s been fine up
till now and its [
] starting to smoke again and it's crazy smoke now,
is aware of the burn off - revs will jump [
] and massive amounts of
smoke would just emit and it does [
] goes into the vehicle, which
harms his family and it’s very annoying and uncomfortable.
143 On 15 November 2018, Mr Williams again lodged a complaint with TMCA as
follows (at [173]:
Please call me, I have ongoing problems with my 2016 Prado, blowing smoke, this
] 9 times, three DPF have been changed. This Vehicle is affected
] my family health, it smells of Diesel, smoke comes in the cabin
when it does a burn while sitting in traffic, it is dangerous.
144 On 17 November 2018, Mr Williams lodged a complaint with Toyota Finance,
which stated (at [174]):
I am writing in relation to my 2016 Prado which has ongoing problems with
blowing smoke.
It has been back to Old Mac [
] Toyota Cleveland QLD 9 times.
It has had 3 DPF replaced, forced burns have been carried out.
The problems is [
] the smell and fumes entering the Vehicle.
Twice now while sitting at the traffic lights it has done a large burn and the
smoke has entered the cabin area with my whole family
in the car, young
I have tried to be patient with working in with trying to fix the problem but
after so many attempts it is not working.
The vehicle is under finance with Toyota and I would be happy to walk away from
it, I owe around $45,00.00 [
], I have fitted [
] bull bar,
snorkel, electric brake system for towing, tow bar, c/b radio, I am happy just
to walk away.
I am certain that this ongoing problem falls under lemon laws.
This vehicle cost me $380.00 a week to run. To date I have spent $24,000 in loan
repayments and $5,000 on extras fitted to the Vehicle.
I will wait [
] the return email or phone call to discuss.
If I don’t get a response I will stop payments to Toyota finance and happy
to get a poor credit rating for it, you can come
and take the car, my family are
not going back in the car, the smoke is bad, no more I have am over it
Every time I take it back to Toyota it is good for 3 months, then it starts
again. I have to take time off work, drop the car off,
pick it up, drop my wife
145 On 20 November 2018, Mr Williams received a call from someone at TMCA in
response to the 15 November 2018 complaint. TMCA’s
record of this
conversation includes (at [173]):
Guest advised that the concern is that the smoke is getting in the vehicle when
the burn off is done and kids are in the car and
he thinks this is dangerous.
146 Notwithstanding these complaints, and the numerous vehicle services
described below, Mr Williams continued to experience frequent
instances of his
vehicle emitting foul-smelling white smoke throughout the period he continued to
drive for work: First Williams
Affidavit (at [135], [139], [144], [149], [172],
[204], [214]).
147 The referee concluded that the Relevant Prado
experienced symptoms and consequences consistent with the Core Defect, including
emitting excessive white smoke and a foul odour: First Referee’s Report
(at [14], [42], [57]–[58]).
Increased fuel consumption
148 Once the Relevant Prado began to experience
incidents of emitting foul-smelling white smoke, Mr Williams also observed that
fuel consumption increased: First Williams Affidavit (at [128]). It will be
necessary to turn to the issue of Mr Williams’
increased fuel consumption
in more depth below: see [
Servicing and repairs
149 Mr Williams has taken
the Relevant Prado for servicing at least 17 times, including 10 scheduled
services and seven unscheduled
services: Williams (at [114]–[115]). The
DPF System was replaced at least twice, the ECU was reprogrammed at least twice,
burns were conducted at least four times, and the fifth injector was
cleaned at least twice: Williams (at [142]–[143], [160],
[163]–[166], [169]–[171]). None of the attempts to fix the problems
with the Relevant Prado were successful.
150 Relevantly, the referee concluded in his First Report (at [42]) that:
Service records for [the Relevant Prado] confirm that it exhibited symptoms
consistent with the core defect. In particular, during
the Relevant Period from
at least 19 June 2017 to 11 June 2018, [the Relevant Prado] required repeated
unscheduled maintenance due
to it emitting excessive white smoke and an
offensive odor [
]. These adverse effects persisted even after several
unscheduled visits to a dealership to address the complaints through diagnostic
and service procedures, including those detailed in Technical Newsflash
bulletins (TNFs) and All Dealer Service Letters (ADSLs) provided
to Australian
dealers by the Respondent during the Relevant Period.
151 At the service conducted in October 2020,
being the last occasion on which the Relevant Prado was serviced, Mr Williams
by the dealership conducting the service that the DPF needed to be
replaced yet again. He was told he would “have to book it
in for another
service once we have the replacement parts”: First Williams Affidavit (at
[213]). As at the hearing, the dealership
was yet to contact Mr Williams to let
him know whether the necessary replacement parts had arrived: T67.35–46,
If the dealership had contacted him to let him know the
replacement parts were ready, Mr Williams’ evidence is that he would
taken his vehicle in to have the necessary repairs carried out:
Income forgone
were also instances where the Relevant Prado required servicing for issues
associated with its DPF System on a day when
Mr Williams was due to be
inspecting vehicles for work (on behalf of DCS). As a result, he was unable to
undertake any inspections
that day: Williams (at [229]–[239]). Mr Williams
has therefore missed work on several occasions as a consequence of the Core
Defect and Defect Consequences (with the result that DCS lost the benefit of the
payments that it would have received for the performance
of that work). This
happened on 27 April 2018, 12 April 2019, and 20 March 2020: Williams (at
[231]). On each occasion, DCS lost
between $1,350 and $1,800 (excluding GST) in
revenue: First Williams Affidavit (at [237]).
C ACCEPTABLE QUALITY CASE
applicants contend that each of the Relevant Vehicles was not of
“acceptable quality” within the meaning of s
54(2) of the ACL, and
therefore failed to comply with the statutory guarantee as to acceptable quality
in s 54(1).
C.1 The relevant provisions
154 Section
54 of the ACL is, relevantly, in the following terms:
54 Guarantee as to acceptable quality
(a) a person supplies, in trade or commerce, goods to a consumer; and
(b) the supply does not occur by way of sale by auction;
there is a guarantee that the goods are of acceptable quality.
(2) Goods are of
acceptable quality
if they are as:
(a) fit for all the purposes for which goods of that kind are commonly
supplied; and
(b) acceptable in appearance and finish; and
(c) free from defects; and
(d) safe; and
(e) durable;
as a reasonable consumer fully acquainted with the state and condition of the
goods (including any hidden defects of the goods),
would regard as acceptable
having regard to the matters in subsection (3).
(3) The matters for the purposes of subsection (2) are:
(a) the nature of the goods; and
(b) the price of the goods (if relevant); and
(c) any statements made about the goods on any packaging or label on the goods;
(d) any representation made about the goods by the supplier or manufacturer of
the goods; and
(e) any other relevant circumstances relating to the supply of the goods.
(Emphasis in original).
C.2 Does the guarantee in s 54 apply?
155 Subject to one
clarification to which I will come, it is common ground that each of the
Relevant Vehicles was supplied with the
statutory guarantee as to acceptable
quality: AF [200]. The claims advanced arise out of the supply of Relevant
Vehicles to group
members by dealers or “other retailers”. Each
Relevant Vehicle supplied in those circumstances was relevantly
“supplied”,
“in trade or commerce”, “to a
consumer”, “other than by way of sale by auction”: AF
[201]–[203].
156 The definition of “Group Members” in this proceeding is not,
however, limited to persons who acquired Relevant Vehicles
in the circumstances
described above. It also includes people who acquired the Relevant Vehicles
second hand from a person who acquired
the vehicle in the circumstances
described above, because the class of persons who may bring an action for
damages against the manufacturer
of goods for a failure of the goods to comply
with the statutory guarantee is broader than simply the consumer who first
157 Indeed, where, in respect of “a supply
of goods to a consumer”, the guarantee under s 54 is not complied with,
affected person
in relation to the goods may ... recover
damages from the manufacturer” pursuant to s 271 (emphasis added). The
term “affected
person” is defined in s 2 of the ACL as follows:
affected person
, in relation to goods, means:
(a) a consumer who acquires the goods; or
(b) a person who acquires the goods from the consumer (other than for the
purpose of re-supply); or
(c) a person who derives title to the goods through or under the consumer.
(Emphasis in original).
158 The term “manufacturer”, as it appears in s 271, is defined
in s 7 of the ACL. TMCA is the “manufacturer”
of the Relevant
Vehicles pursuant to s 7(e) of the ACL: see also AF [6].
159 Accordingly, the group members, in relation
to each relevant instance of supply of a Relevant Vehicle, are: (1) the
who acquired a Relevant Vehicle from a dealer or other retailer; and
(2) any person who acquired a Relevant Vehicle from that consumer
other than for
the purpose of re-supply. This means that in relation to any particular Relevant
Vehicle, there may be more than one
group member who qualifies as an
“affected person” and is therefore entitled to bring a claim under s
271 of the ACL
in respect of a failure to comply with the guarantee in s 54.
160 The one clarifying matter I foreshadowed above is effect of s 271(6) of
161 Section 271 and the provision which immediately follows, s 272, are,
relevantly, in the following terms:
271 Action for damages against manufacturers of goods
(a) the guarantee under section 54 applies to a supply of goods to a consumer;
(b) the guarantee is not complied with;
an affected person in relation to the goods may, by action against the
manufacturer of the goods, recover damages from the manufacturer.
(6) If an affected person in relation to goods has, in accordance with an
express warranty given or made by the manufacturer of
the goods, required the
manufacturer to remedy a failure to comply with a guarantee referred to in
subsection (1), (3) or (5):
(a) by repairing the goods; or
(b) by replacing the goods with goods of an identical type;
then, despite that subsection, the affected person is not entitled to commence
an action under that subsection to recover damages
of a kind referred to in
section 272(1)(a) unless the manufacturer has refused or failed to remedy the
failure, or has failed to
remedy the failure within a reasonable time.
Damages that may be recovered by action
against manufacturers of goods
(1) In an action for damages under this Division, an affected person in relation
to goods is entitled to recover damages for:
(a) any reduction in the value of the goods, resulting from the failure to
comply with the guarantee to which the action relates,
below whichever of the
following prices is lower:
(i) the price paid or payable
by the consumer for the goods;
(ii) the average retail price of the goods at the time of supply; and
(b) any loss or damage suffered by the affected person because of the failure
to comply with the guarantee to which the action relates
if it was reasonably
foreseeable that the affected person would suffer such loss or damage as a
result of such a failure.
162 TMCA accepts that the guarantee of acceptable
quality applies to Relevant Vehicles purchased by group members, but submits
those with respect to whom 271(6) applies cannot commence an action for
reduction in value damages under s 272(1)(a). So much is
true. This does not,
however, have the effect of excluding the application of the guarantee in s 54
to the supply of goods in respect
of which such persons would otherwise have a
cause of action. Persons to whom s 271(6) applies may still bring an action
for damages
under s 272(1)(b) in respect of the relevant failure to comply
with the guarantee under s 54. Hence, the guarantee in s 54 applies
instances of supply of a Relevant Vehicle that are the subject of
this proceeding. That is so regardless of whether s 271(6) applies
to some group
163 This qualifying matter is important given, as will be seen below, the
applicants do not currently seek relief under s 272(1)(a)
on behalf of those
group members who received the 2020 Field Fix (
2020 Field Fix Group
). This is because, in respect of these group members, there is a
live dispute (to be resolved at a later date) as to the application
of s 271(6).
C.3 Was the guarantee in s 54 was complied with?
C.3.1 Construing s 54 of the ACL
164 Despite
the obscure drafting of other sections of the ACL, s 54 is relatively
straightforward. The continued use of the conjunction
54(2) makes clear that goods must possess
of the qualities listed in
s 54(2), to the requisite standard, in order to comply with the guarantee of
acceptable quality. Failure
to possess any one of those qualities will result in
a failure to comply with the guarantee: see

Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission v Jayco Corporation Pty Ltd
[2020] FCA 1672
(at [25] per
Wheelahan J).
165 The question of whether the goods are of acceptable quality is to be
answered by reference to the quality of the goods at the
time of supply:
Capic v Ford Motor Company of Australia Pty Ltd
[2021] FCA 715
154 ACSR 235
(at 377 [606] per Perram J);
(at 738 [170]–[171], 760 [263]). The applicable standard of
“acceptable quality” is to be determined by reference
to what the
“reasonable consumer” would regard as acceptable, having regard to
the matters in s 54(3). The relevant enquiry
is necessarily objective:
Pty Ltd v Courtney
[2003] FCAFC 151
(2003) 130 FCR 182
(at 199 [43]
per Moore J, 205 [64] and 207 [72] per Branson J, with whom Jacobson J agreed at
(at 265 [105]). As Wheelahan J explained in
The reasonable consumer sits with an array of other hypothetical persons who
have been recruited by the law and by reference to whom
objective standards are
evaluated: see,
Healthcare at Home Ltd v The Common Services Agency
[2014] UKSC 49
; 4 All ER 210 at
–[4] (Lord Reed JSC). Such a person has
been described as an anthropomorphic conception of justice that is and must be
itself: see
Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham Urban District
[1956] UKHL 3
[1956] AC 696
at 728 (Lord Radcliffe).
166 In determining whether the “reasonable consumer” would regard
the goods as acceptable at the time of supply, one must
assume that the
construct is “fully acquainted with the state and condition of the goods
(including any hidden defects of the
goods)”: s 54(2) of the ACL; see also
(at 205–206 [65]–[70]). Thus, in the present case, the
“reasonable consumer” is taken be fully acquainted
with the nature
of the Core Defect, including the ways in which it causes the Relevant Vehicles
to malfunction when exposed to the
High Speed Driving Pattern, and the class of
consequences or symptoms associated with the Core Defect.
167 Although TMCA accepts that the question of whether the goods are of
acceptable quality is to be assessed by reference to the quality
of the goods at
the time of supply, it submits that the determination of what was objectively
reasonable for the consumer to expect
is made taking into account all relevant
information available at the time of trial. Relying on the reasoning in
(at 200 [45], 203 [57], 206 [70], 209 [81]), TMCA submits that
“the individual experience of each vehicle owner, affects the
assessment”.
168 The flaw in this proposition is that the state and condition of the
vehicles at the time of supply is not determined by anything
occurring after the
time of supply. The fact that a defective product has continued to perform
following the time of supply through
to the time of trial does not defeat a
finding that the product was defective at the time it was supplied. In
, as Branson J (at 202 [54], with whom Jacobson J agreed at 209
[81]) explained, “the principal issue to be determined ... is
product which, at the time of trial, can be demonstrated to have performed, and
to be continuing to perform, satisfactorily
can nonetheless be found to be
“not of merchantable quality” within the meaning of s 74D(1) of the
Trade Practices Act 1974
(Cth)”. Her Honour found (at 199 [41])
that the goods in issue – pacemakers – were not of merchantable
at the time of supply, despite the fact that the applicant’s
pacemaker had not failed by the time of trial: see generally at
169 Two further points should be noted.
, it is inappropriate to imbue the “reasonable
consumer” with knowledge that an effective fix will ultimately become
as TMCA contends. This is not a matter that goes to “the state
and condition of the goods” at the time of supply (cf
of the ACL);
nor is it a fact that could have been known at the time of supply (by contrast,
the Core Defect was present in the Relevant
Vehicles, and therefore knowable, in
the sense relevant to the operation of
, at the time of supply): see
(at 206 [69]–[70], citing
Henry Kendall & Sons v
William Lillico & Sons Ltd
[1968] UKHL 3
[1969] 2 AC 31
at 118–119 per Lord
Pearce). Whether a reasonable consumer would, at the time of purchase
“expect a fix for the DPF defect
... to become available” differs
from the question of whether the reasonable consumer would, at the time of
purchase, consider
it acceptable (in spite of such expectation) that no fix is
presently available, and it is not known wh
will become available: see also
(at 384 [641]).
, TMCA submits that “the best guide to the
hypothetical reasonable consumer is the evidence of what actual market
participants
have done in respect of the vehicles”. In doing so, TMCA
proceeds upon the assumption, based on what it says is evidence of
market data, that the “actual market participants” (that is, persons
buying Relevant Vehicles second-hand)
were “fully acquainted with the
state and condition of the goods (including any hidden defects of the
goods)” at the
time of supply. There are a number of issues with this
, it is unfounded as a proposition of law.
calls for the determination of a hypothetical question by reference to a
hypothetical consumer
imputed with knowledge of the true facts (including
of justice that is and must be the Court itself: see
[26] per Wheelahan J). At a minimum, any suggested connexion between the
statutory test involving the hypothetical reasonable
consumer and empirical data
consideration of that data. This
leads to the
difficulty, that is,
TMCA relies on data about sales in the second-hand market. Even if (contrary to
what I have found above at [
]), some inference could be drawn
problems, that would
not lead to the conclusion that buyers of new vehicles were
aware that they were buying vehicles that suffered from the Core Defect.
172 It is then convenient to turn to an analysis of the factors outlined in
and (3). I propose to deal first with the matters in
turning to the mandatory considerations in (3).
Section 54(2)
might have thought that given what has already been canvassed above, the
liability case is glaringly obvious: the product
was not of acceptable quality.
Alas, reams of submissions were made contesting this conclusion and it is
necessary to deal with them.
Fit for all the purposes for which goods of that kind are
commonly supplied (ACL 54(2)(a))
174 Curiously, TMCA
disputes that the Relevant Vehicles were “fit for all the purposes”
as a reasonable consumer would
regard as acceptable. TMCA’s primary
position is to downplay the significance of the Core Defect and its
consequences. Indeed,
the following submissions are advanced:
(1) it is an overstatement to claim that the DPF System
“malfunctioned” during instances of the High Speed Driving Pattern,
given Toyota’s Owners’ Manuals and other material provided to guests
explained that the emission of white smoke during
regeneration was a
characteristic of the DPF System;
(2) the DPF System is designed to ensure compliance with emissions rules, and is
not essential for the operation of essential parts
of the Relevant Vehicles and
there is no suggestion that the Core Defect resulted in a failure to comply with
any emissions rules;
(3) the Relevant Vehicles were operational in any driving environment, including
the High Speed Driving Pattern, even with the Core
Defect present.
175 It is submitted that the severity of the DPF defect should be
distinguished from, for example,
, where the defect created a
superadded risk of failure of the pacemaker such that the pacemaker was not fit
for the purpose for which
goods of that kind are commonly bought. There, it was
said that the consumer’s life depended on the pacemaker (see 200 [46]),
whereas here the operation of each Relevant Vehicle did not depend on the DPF
System: AF [34]–[39], [42].
176 I reject these submissions.
177 As the referee found, the Relevant Vehicles were “not designed to
function effectively during all reasonably expected conditions
operation and use in the Australian market”: First Referee’s Report
(at [8]; see also [21]); AF [67]. The Relevant
Vehicles could not be exposed to
the High Speed Driving Pattern without the DPF System malfunctioning: AF [73].
When the DPF System
malfunctioned, one or more adverse consequences outlined
above (at [
]) ensued. No reasonable
consumer acquiring a new vehicle would regard as acceptable the fact that the
vehicle cannot be exposed to
a mode of operation and use that is considered
normal in the Australian market without malfunctioning.
178 Insofar as TMCA submits that so long as the Relevant Vehicles did not
“cease to function”, they could still transport
“from A to B”, and were fit for all the purposes for which goods of
that kind are commonly supplied, this
is untethered to any analysis of the
applicable statutory standard. A reasonable consumer would not regard as
for all purposes a vehicle that transports the passenger
“from A to B”, but in doing so, has a propensity to exhibit
Defect Consequences.
179 It is no answer to say, as TMCA does, that the proposition that
“the emission of white smoke during regeneration was a characteristic
the DPF System” was explained in “Toyota’s Owners’
Manuals and other materials”. The referee found
that although the
Owner’s Manuals identified the emission of some white smoke as “a
normal characteristic of DPF System
regeneration”, the level of white
smoke emitted by the Relevant Vehicles as a consequence of the Core Defect was
and excessive”: First Referee’s Report (at [48]); see
also AF [75(c)].
180 In the light of the above, TMCA’s contention that, notwithstanding
the Core Defect, the Relevant Vehicles operated in a
non-defective manner is
unsubstantiated and made in the teeth of the evidence.
Acceptable in appearance and finish (ACL 54(2)(b))
181 “Finish”,
as the term is used in
of the ACL, has a meaning which extends beyond
merely visual qualities of the goods:
(at 389 [671]). As the
referee found, a consequence of the Core Defect was the emission of
“excessive” white smoke and
“foul-smelling” exhaust from
the vehicle’s exhaust pipe during and after regeneration: see [
(3), (5)]. I am satisfied that the
reasonable consumer would not regard this as acceptable. TMCA attempts to
distinguish
on the basis that
involved, relevantly,
“gear rattle”. But no analysis is offered as to why a tendency to
exhibit gear rattle means that
the vehicles in that case were not acceptable in
terms of their ‘finish’” (
(at 389 [671]), and yet
a tendency to emit “excessive” white smoke and
“foul-smelling” exhaust does not.
It is a distinction without a
difference.
Free from defects (ACL 54(2)(c))
182 Apart from seeking to
draw a distinction between goods that are defective, and goods that contain a
defective component (a notion
I reject), TMCA contends that the emission of
excessive and foul-smelling white smoke is not something that a reasonable
would regard as unacceptable because it does not, for example, impact
upon the “safety” of the vehicle. TMCA submits
that “it would
be perfectly rational for the applicants’ hypothetical consumer to
conclude that excess white smoke (which
might be emitted if the car was driven
in a particular way) mattered very little ... such that the defect in the DPF
System made
no material difference to the way in which they valued the
submission should be rejected. The adverse consequences and symptoms associated
with the Core Defect are not trivial. When
they manifest, they impact
significantly upon consumers’ use and enjoyment of the Relevant Vehicles.
TMCA’s business
records are replete with thousands of complaints from
group members attesting to this. For example, group members complained to TMCA
(1) discomfort and/or distress experienced by drivers of and passengers in the
Relevant Vehicles due to the emission of the foul-smelling
white smoke;
(2) in relation to the emission of foul-smelling white smoke, inability to use
standard features of the Relevant Vehicles while driving
such as putting the
windows down, poor visibility, abuse from other motorists and/or pedestrians,
being pulled over by the police,
and a general feeling of embarrassment when
(3) frustration at the inconvenience of frequent servicing and/or repairs in
addition to the regular servicing of the vehicles, and
loss of work
opportunities and/or income due to the Relevant Vehicles being off the road for
the additional servicing and repairs;
(4) frustration that the fuel economy of the Relevant Vehicles was significantly
worse than the fuel economy advertised by TMCA or
as compared to the fuel
economy when the Relevant Vehicle was first purchased; and
(5) feeling angry, deceived, misled, frustrated, disappointed, stressed and
inconvenienced by their experience in driving the Relevant
Vehicles and/or
expressing a wish that they had never purchased, or that they no longer wanted
to use, the vehicles.
184 These are not idiosyncratic or unpredictable
responses of the kind that might only be said to emerge on an
analysis. Rather, these are the kind of adverse experiences and reactions that
would be anticipated and would cause a reasonable
consumer, acquainted with the
defective character of the Relevant Vehicles, to regard those goods as not of
acceptable quality.
185 In response, TMCA submits that it is “not known” whether the
white smoke complained of by these customers was
caused by the
Core Defect (as opposed to, for example, improper usage of the Relevant
Vehicles). That submission is fallacious in
the light of the sheer number of
complaints. Indeed, TMCA itself recognised the serious nature of the Defect
Consequences in connexion
with its DPF “Consumer Redress Program”,
through which it provided refunds or replacement vehicles to hundreds of
in recognition of a “major failure” of the subject
vehicles to comply with statutory guarantees: Nelson Affidavit (at
[152]–[167]); T103.39–40.
186 Finally, for completeness, I should note that TMCA submits that
“[i]n [the] light of the fact that there are Group Members
to take advantage of the 2020 Field Fix, it can readily be
concluded that those Group Members do not perceive their vehicles to be
in any significant way”. No such conclusion can readily be drawn. There
are numerous reasons why group members may
not have received the 2020 Field Fix,
including that: (a) the group member may have subjected their Relevant Vehicle
to one of the
ineffective earlier countermeasures which exacerbated rather than
remedied the Core Defect and consequently decided against returning
to TMCA for
any further repairs; (b) the group member may not be aware of the availability
of the 2020 Field Fix; and (c) the group
member may be intending to take up the
fix, but has not yet organised to do so.
187 Hence, notwithstanding the lengthy submissions on the point, it is
obvious the reasonable consumer would not have viewed the Relevant
Vehicles as
defect-free.
Durable (ACL 54(2)(e))
188 Turning to the final
factor, durability, TMCA accepts that the DPF System was not as durable as a
reasonable consumer would expect,
but again, emphasises that it was only the DPF
System, not the vehicle as a whole, that suffered from the Core Defect. This
should be rejected for the reasons already explained (at [
]). A vehicle that requires frequent,
unscheduled repair or replacement of a component part would not be regarded as
acceptably “durable”
by a reasonable consumer. When the DPF System
fails, it is
the vehicle
, not the DPF System, that must be brought in to
the dealership for servicing and repair.
Conclusion on
189 Having regard to the
conclusions of the referee, as found by the Court, the conclusion that the
Relevant Vehicles did not comply
with the guarantee as to acceptable quality is
clear, even before one considers the additional factors in support of that
contained in
It is, however, necessary to detail these
matters given they are mandatory considerations.
Section 54(3)
of the ACL sets out “mandatory matters” that must be
considered in determining whether the guarantee of acceptable quality
breached: see
(at 384 [637]).
191 Pursuant to
, regard must be had to “any
representation made about the goods by the supplier or manufacturer of the
goods”. As explained
above, TMCA marketed all of the Relevant Vehicles
throughout the Relevant Period as non-defective, good quality, reliable, and
vehicles that were suitable for all conditions of normal operation and
use in the Australian market: see AF [187]–[190]. TMCA
further marketed
the Relevant Vehicles as having a DPF System that was non-defective, of good
quality, reliable, durable, did not
have a propensity to fail and was sufficient
to prevent the DPF from becoming partially or completely blocked. These
representations
are admitted (see [
]), and there was nothing in
TMCA’s marketing of the Relevant Vehicles that would “temper”
the reasonable consumer’s
expectation as to the quality of the Relevant
(at [27]). As such, having regard to the way in which the
Relevant Vehicles were marketed, the conclusions set out above as to the
reasonable consumers’ expectations are only fortified: see also
(at 389 [669]–[670]).
192 TMCA submits that, despite its failure to correct or qualify the
misleading representations, it is nevertheless possible that
dealers made
representations to consumers acquiring Relevant Vehicles that disclosed the
problems with the Relevant Vehicles, prior
to acquisition. For the reasons I
have outlined above (at [
]), this contention should be
193 I should, however, address an additional submission. TMCA submits that it
was not “privy” to any of the sales of 97
per cent of Relevant
Vehicles and asserts that it remains incumbent on those who allege a breach of
to put forward all relevant evidence to satisfy the court of the mandatory
I disagree. Although the factors in
are mandatory
considerations, the applicants are under no duty to adduce all evidence of
communications between dealers and customers.
All evidence is to be weighed
according to the proof which it was in the power of one side to have produced,
and the other to have
contradicted:
Blatch v Archer
[1774] EngR 2
(1774) 1 Cowp 63
65 per Lord Mansfield). While it was not incumbent on TMCA to lead evidence of
the circumstances of each and every supply, if
TMCA wished to rely upon any
representation as relevant to the analysis under
of the ACL, it was
open to it to lead evidence in this respect (for example, by calling any of the
dealers in TMCA’s camp who
sold Relevant Vehicles, to give evidence about
the kinds of representations they made to consumers at the point of sale).
194 Insofar as TMCA submits that representations arising from “news
articles”, “word of mouth”, or “comments
dealerships selling competing vehicles” are relevant to the analysis under
, that submission is incorrect.
Section 54(3)(d)
is concerned with
representations made about the goods
by the supplier or manufacturer
195 As regards to the other relevant considerations in
, the following
two points can be made.
, in respect of the “the nature of the goods”
, the Relevant Vehicles are light-duty diesel vehicles. The
“reasonably expected conditions of normal operation and use”
Relevant Vehicles in the Australian market included the High Speed Driving
Pattern (that is, regular highway driving): AF
[67]; First Referee’s
Report (at [8]). There is nothing about the nature of the vehicles that would
suggest that the reasonable
consumer would regard as acceptable the fact that
the Relevant Vehicles cannot be exposed to such a mode of driving without
malfunctioning.
, in respect of the “the price of the goods”
(s 54(3)(b))
, although the prices of the Relevant Vehicles, when sold as new
vehicles, differ according to model line and model year, as a general
observation all of the Relevant Vehicles were sold for substantial amounts. This
reflects the fact that these were not cheap items
attracting commensurately low
expectations of quality, reliability and durability: AF [21]. The MSRP prices
were within the following
(1) for the HiLux 4x2, $24,990 to $51,340;
(2) for the HiLux 4x4, $36,990 to $65,090;
(3) for the Fortuner, $42,590 to $62,540; and
(4) for the Prado, $52,990 to $89,590.
198 In reaching this conclusion, it may be accepted, as Stevenson J observed
Dwyer v Volkswagen Group Australia Pty Ltd
[2021] NSWSC 715
[158]), that the reasonable consumer would “be acquainted with the fact
that motor vehicles are complicated pieces of machinery
that may develop
problems ... that may require rectification by the manufacturer during the
vehicle’s lifetime”. But
this is a radically different thing to
accepting that a vehicle, because of a defect already present at the time of
supply, cannot
be used in a reasonable and normal way without malfunctioning and
consequently exposing the vehicle to one or more non-trivial, adverse
consequences: see
(at 384 [636]).
C.4 Determining the question of acceptable quality on a common
point of contest which divides the parties is whether the Court can and should
determine the question of whether the Relevant
Vehicles were of acceptable
quality on a common basis. The applicants contend I can and should determine the
issue of acceptable
quality on a common basis, but TMCA submit, I cannot, and
should not.
200 As the authorities reveal, there are cases in which liability under
can be determined on a common basis and others where it cannot. Whether the
question of liability under
can be determined as a common question will
depend on the facts and how the parties conduct their positions, all of which
will differ
between cases. In saying this, the cases are useful in locating the
current facts. In cases such as
(relating to a gear box defect),
Ethicon Sàrl v Gill
[2021] FCAFC 29
(2021) 387 ALR 494
to defective pelvic mesh implants) and
(relating to faulty
pacemakers), the question of acceptable quality was been determined on a common
201 By contrast, in
Owners – Strata Plan No 87231 v 3A Composites
GmbH (No 5)
[2020] FCA 1576
(2020) 148 ACSR 445
(at 452–453
[26]–[32]), Wigney J declined to address the question of liability under
on a common question. That case related to allegations that certain aluminium
composite panels distributed in Australia were not
of merchantable quality for
the purposes of s 74D of the
Trade Practices Act 1974
and were not of acceptable quality for the purposes of
of the ACL. In
declining to find that the questions which purported to pose the statutory tests
or questions in s 74D of the TPA
of the ACL were common questions, his
Honour reasoned (at 452–453 [26]–[32]) that:
29. The list of “matters” in
are not generic, as was
submitted by Owners, but relate to the goods the subject of the specific supply
in question. For example,
the price of the goods
(s 54(3)(b))
is the price of
the goods actually supplied and the statements made on the packaging and labels
(s 54(3)(c))
are the statements made on the packaging and labelling in the case
of the specific supply. In this case, it could not necessarily
be concluded that
all of the group members purchased the relevant goods for the same price, or in
the same packaging. It is equally
clear that the “circumstances relating
to the supply of the goods” referred to in
of the ACL must be a
reference to the specific supply in question.
30. This construction of the provisions is also supported by such consideration
as has been given to the issue in the authorities.
Graham Barclay
, Lindgren J (with whom Lee J relevantly agreed) said as follows
concerning the objective test in s 74D of the TPA (at [533]–[534]):
The words “as it is
reasonable to expect” suggests a question as to the identity of the person
or persons, the reasonableness
of whose expectation is in question and is to be
determined by the court. Possible contenders are:
(1) the consumer or other person who suffers loss or damage;
(2) a reasonable consumer placed as that actual consumer or other person
(3) a reasonable bystander (in effect, the court).
In my opinion consistently with both the objective nature of the standard aimed
for and the consumer protection purpose of the provision,
it is the second or
third category of person whose reasonable expectation is called into service by
the statute, and in my opinion
a reasonable bystander would seek to put himself
or herself in the position of a reasonable consumer placed as the actual
or other person was. Accordingly, it is right to inquire into the
reasonable expectations of a category (2)
31. In other words, the reasonable consumer effectively stands in the shoes of
the actual consumer. There is no reason to think that
of the ACL should be
construed differently. Indeed, as already noted, the language of
even more strongly to this being the correct construction. I am not persuaded
that there is any basis for concluding that
Lindgren J’s conclusion was
wrong. In any event, Lee J agreed with Lindgren J and accordingly I am
effectively bound to follow
that conclusion. It should also be noted that Moore
(at [42]–[43]) effectively approved Lindgren J’s
formulation of the test and nothing said by Branson J (with whom Jacobson
agreed) suggested any disagreement with that formulation.
32. It follows that, to the extent that questions 44, 45 and 46 purport to
address the statutory tests in s 74D of the TPA and
of the ACL, they cannot
be common questions. That is because to answer those questions, it is necessary
to have regard to the relevant
circumstances of the particular supply in
question, including matters such as the price, any statements made on the
packaging or
labels and any other “relevant circumstances relating to the
supply”. Those circumstances may not be determinative or
even particularly
significant having regard to other findings that may be made. But that cannot be
determined unless and until those
circumstances are considered. More
significantly, the circumstances will not necessarily be the same in respect of
every supply to
every group member.
202 A further example of a case in which a judge declined to determine issues
of liability on a common basis was
Merck Sharp & Dohme (Australia) Pty
Ltd v Peterson
[2011] FCAFC 128
(2011) 196 FCR 145.
There, the primary
judge held that the question of whether “Vioxx tablets [were] not of
merchantable quality within the meaning
of section 74D [of the TPA] by reason of
the fact that consumption of Vioxx materially increased the risk of suffering
the [relevant]
condition” was not a common question given the question
could not be determined uniformly. The Full Court did not disturb that
(see 195–196 [180]‑–[182]), and referred to the fact that the
statute itself (there, s 74D of the TPA)
recognised that the description of the
goods, the price of the goods and “all other relevant circumstances”
are relevant
in determining what was reasonable to expect about fitness for
purpose at the time of supply: see 196 [182].
203 TMCA seeks to distinguish the current case from
it in the realm of the reasoning in
. It is said
that the number of relevant vehicles in
, while substantial, was
significantly lower than in the present case (73,451, or less than a third
compared to the present case),
the purchasers were relatively uniform
(purchasers of Focus, Fiesta and EcoSport vehicles, described as
“economical entry level
vehicles”), and the case involved a
different mechanical problem (defects in the transmission): see
244–247 [17]–[35], 379 [615]).
204 TMCA submits that the applicants’
attempt to treat the Relevant Vehicles as an undifferentiated whole and their
as homogenous is erroneous for the following reasons:
(1) While the Relevant Vehicles are broadly described as HiLux, Prado and
Fortuner, there were 49 different sub-types of those vehicles
with different
overall specifications: see AF [7]. Even among those 49 different types of
vehicles, there was variation, as purchasers
were offered a range of options and
accessories: T55.21–41.
(2) The various group members had various different characteristics. There are
264,170 Relevant Vehicles. 22,578 of the initial purchasers
of those vehicles
purchased more than one Relevant Vehicle and 972 of those initial purchasers
purchased more than 20 Relevant Vehicles,
with five purchasers purchasing more
than 500 vehicles: Berndt Affidavit (at [9]). It is said that one would expect
the research
carried out by those who purchase large volumes of Relevant
Vehicles to be different to those carried out by a purchaser of only
(3) It is said that the discussions that each purchaser had with the seller of
their vehicle(s) would also necessarily have differed.
For example, TMCA
contends that purchaser who raised with their seller the question of white smoke
that had been reported in the
media, or as a consequence of their own research
or discussions with others in the industry (e.g. other competing car dealers),
have been assured that all necessary repairs would be covered by warranty
(just like most other problems with Toyota vehicles).
(4) That a class action has been brought on behalf of group members as opposed
to just one purchaser, it is submitted, does not change
the statutory test
prescribed by
, particularly in circumstances where, as the appellants
accept, “[t]he significance of each of the matters in
vary with each case.”
205 Put simply, it is said that the interactions
between each seller and purchaser are relevant to the assessment under
206 In considering this issue, it is first necessary to reiterate that the
applicants’ case is not that the Relevant Vehicles
were not of acceptable
quality because the Core Defect
manifested in one or more adverse
consequences at some point during the life of each vehicle. Rather, it is that
the Relevant Vehicles
were not of acceptable quality because, at the time they
were supplied, they were defective because of the
flaw in the
design of the DPF System and carried an inherent
to manifest
one or more adverse consequences.
207 Accordingly, it does not matter, for the purposes of the applicants
establishing a failure to comply with the statutory guarantee,
whether or not a
given vehicle ultimately developed the problems it was prone to develop. Indeed,
there is nothing unusual in concluding
that goods are not of acceptable quality
by reason of an inherent risk of failure present at the time of supply, even in
circumstances
where not all of the goods have, in fact, failed: see
(at 250 [52]–[53], 377–378 [608]–[612], 409–410
[774], 433–434 [883]–[886]);
(at 197–198 [36],
199 [41]; 202 [54], 207–208 [74]–[75], 208 [77]);
734 [149]).
208 There is a superficial attraction to TMCA’s submissions that the
Court cannot determine the question of acceptable quality
on a common basis
because the Court is required by
of the ACL to enquire into the individual
circumstances of each instance of supply. However, two reasons point against
this conclusion.
, it must be remembered that in assessing whether goods are
of acceptable quality for the purposes of
, the relevant enquiry is
, to be assessed by reference to the reasonable consumer. The
reasonable consumer is taken to be “fully acquainted with the
condition of the goods (including any hidden defects of the goods)”:
Putting to one side
(which operates separately from the process
for determining whether goods are of acceptable quality as a form of defence
Capic v Ford Motor Company of Australia Pty Ltd (Revised Common
[2021] FCA 1320
per Perram J), the statutory test
does not operate by reference to what a particular individual consumer knew or
subjectively
believed about the condition of the goods.
, I accept that
dictates that regard must be had
to the matters in
in assessing whether goods are of an acceptable
quality, and that the significance of each of the matters in
vary on a case by case basis. That is, I accept that through the objective
statutory prism, there is some room for subjective
contextualisation. But in the
circumstances where: (1) it is alleged that the goods are not of acceptable
quality by reason of a
common characteristic of the goods; and (2) there is no
evidence of some material difference between characteristics such as the
of the goods, the packaging or labelling of the goods, representations made
of the goods, or the
circumstances relating to the supply of the goods, nothing in
prevents the
Court from assessing the quality of the goods, having regard to the matters in
, on a common basis. To the extent it is said it should be inferred there
were material differences between these characteristics
(for example, between
those who purchased a Relevant Vehicle and those who purchased many), that
submission should be rejected. TMCA
has not led any evidence of (or pleaded) any
material difference that is capable of bearing upon the question of whether a
consumer would regard a Relevant Vehicle as being of acceptable
211 To my mind, this case is relatively indistinguishable from
(at 376–389 [603]–[673], 390–392 [675]–[690]). The
supplies at issue in
were not materially less diverse than the
supplies at issue in this case. Each of the 73,451 vehicle in
potentially involved the kind of unique interaction between supplier and
consumer that TMCA hypothesises in the present case and
that was no obstacle to
a common finding of a failure to comply with the statutory guarantee. More to
the point, this case is distinguishable
. As outlined above,
Wigney J held (at 452–453 [29]) that in that case “it could not
necessarily be concluded that all
of the group members purchased the relevant
goods for the same price, or in the same packaging”, and there appeared to
live issue as to the significance of any such differences: (at 453 [32]).
Here, TMCA has not pleaded or otherwise raised any relevant,
material difference
between the circumstances of any given instance of supply of a Relevant Vehicle
capable of bearing upon the question
of whether a reasonable consumer would
regard the Relevant Vehicle as acceptable. Nor do the circumstances suggest
there is any realistic
possibility of such individual factors being material,
having regard in particular to the nature of the defects and the admitted
representations.
212 There is no impediment to determining the issue of acceptable quality on
a common basis.
C.5 Was the guarantee in
complied with in respect of the
Relevant Prado?
follows that the Relevant Prado, which is a Relevant Vehicle, was not of
acceptable quality at the time it was supplied to
DCS. TMCA accepts this.
D MISLEADING AND DECEPTIVE CONDUCT CASE
applicants allege that, continuously throughout the Relevant Period, TMCA made
several representations in relation to the
Relevant Vehicles that were
misleading in contravention of
of the ACL.
D.1 The representations
the applicants’ case initially included number of disputed
representations, only those admitted by TMCA are now pressed.
TMCA admits to
making the following representations:
(1) the Relevant Vehicles:
(a) were, or were part of model lines that were, in their design and
manufacturing:
(i) not defective;
(ii) of good quality;
(iii) reliable;
(iv) durable; and
(v) suitable for use in any driving environment;
(b) provided, or were part of model lines that provided, a driving and/or
passenger experience that was comfortable;
(c) would be, or were part of model lines that would be, in their design and
manufacturing:
(i) not defective;
(ii) of good quality;
(iii) reliable;
(iv) durable; and
(v) suitable for use in any driving environment;
(d) would provide, or were part of model lines that would provide, a driving
and/or passenger experience that was comfortable;
(2) the Relevant Vehicles contained, or were part of model lines that contained,
a DPF System that, in its design and manufacturing:
(a) was not defective;
(b) was of good quality;
(c) was reliable;
(d) was durable;
(e) did not have a propensity to fail;
(f) completed a regeneration cycle with sufficient regularity to prevent the DPF
from becoming partially or completely blocked;
(g) would not be defective;
(h) would be of good quality;
(i) would be reliable;
(j) would be durable;
(k) would not have a propensity to fail; and
(l) would complete a regeneration cycle with sufficient regularity to prevent
the DPF from becoming partially or completely blocked.
(collectively, (1)(a)–(b) constitute the
Vehicle Representations
(1)(c)–(d) constitute the
Future Vehicle Representations
(2)(a)–(f) constitute the
DPF System Representations;
(2)(f)–(l) the
Future DPF System Representations
216 For simplicity, I will refer to the four sets of representations
collectively as the
Representations
217 TMCA admits that the Representations were made
“continuously, and continued, throughout the Relevant Period”, were
directed to “the public at large”, and made “in trade or
commerce”: AF [188], [190], [192], [194], [196].
The applicants also
allege, and TMCA admits, that TMCA failed to correct or qualify those continuing
representations: AF [195]. As
such, the scope of the dispute in relation to the
Representations is confined to whether they were misleading or not and, in
to a subset of the representations, whether TMCA had reasonable grounds
for making the Representations.
D.2 Were the representations misleading or deceptive?
218 The applicants
contend that the Representations made by TMCA were:
(1) misleading and deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, in contravention
of the ACL;
(2) false or misleading in contravention of
ss 29(1)(a)
and (g) of the ACL;
(3) liable to mislead the public in contravention of
of the ACL.
219 It is convenient first to set out the relevant legal principles, before
turning to consider each category of Representations.
D.2.1 The relevant principles
is evident, the applicants advance their misleading and deceptive conduct case
on a number of statutory bases.
of the ACL is in the following
18 Misleading or deceptive conduct
(1) A person must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is
misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.
Section 29(a)
and (g) are in the following terms:
False or misleading representations
(1) A person must not, in trade or commerce, in connection with the supply or
possible supply of goods or services or in connection
with the promotion by any
means of the supply or use of goods or services:
(a) make a false or misleading representation that goods are of a particular
standard, quality, value, grade, composition, style
or model or have had a
particular history or particular previous use; or
(g) make a false or misleading representation that goods or services have
sponsorship, approval, performance characteristics, accessories,
is in the following terms:
Misleading conduct as to the nature
etc. of goods
A person must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is liable to
mislead the public as to the nature, the manufacturing
process, the
characteristics, the suitability for their purpose or the quantity of any goods.
223 Generally speaking, there is “no meaningful difference”
between the words and phrases “misleading and deceptive”
“mislead or deceive”
, “false or misleading”
or liable to “mislead”
Australian Competition
and Consumer Commission v Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd
(2014) 317 ALR 73
(at 81 [40] per Allsop CJ); see also,
Competition and Consumer Commission v Google LLC
[2021] FCA 367
(at 369–372 [113]–[127] per Thawley J and the authorities
surveyed by his Honour).
224 However, one caveat should be made to this comment. That is, the
authorities do indicate that the meaning of the phrase “liable
the public” in
of the ACL is a higher standard that “likely to
mislead”. Indeed, in
Coles Supermarkets
, Allsop CJ observed (at 82
While the words and phrases “misleading or deceptive”,
“mislead or deceive”, “false or misleading”
“mislead” are synonymous, the authorities reveal that a distinction
is to be made between “likely to mislead
or deceive” (in
“liable to mislead” (in
The latter has been said to apply to
a narrower range of conduct:
Westpac Banking Corporation v Northern Metals
(1989) 14 IPR 499
Trade Practices Commission v J & R
Enterprises Pty Ltd
[1991] FCA 23
(1991) 99 ALR 325
Enterprises); and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Turi Foods
Pty Ltd (No 4)
[2013] FCA 665
, what is required is that
there be an actual probability that the public would be misled:
Enterprises
at 339. (This citation of
J & R Enterprises
338–9 should not be taken to endorse the comments of O’Loughlin J as
to a burden beyond reasonable doubt at 339.)
225 Notwithstanding this, the enquiry relevant to determining whether
particular conduct had the requisite contravening character
is generally the
same in respect of
of the ACL. Here, at least, any distinction
in statutory wording makes no material difference to the outcome.
226 It is trite to observe that the question of whether conduct is misleading
or deceptive, or is likely to be so, is an objective
question of fact that the
Court must determine for itself:
Campbell v Backoffice Investments Pty Ltd
[2009] HCA 25
(2009) 238 CLR 304
(at 341–342 [102] per Gummow, Hayne,
Heydon and Kiefel JJ), citing
Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd
[2004] HCA 60
(2004) 218 CLR 592
(at 625 [109] per McHugh J). It is not
necessary to prove that the conduct in question
deceived anyone, nor is it necessary to prove an intention to mislead: see
Google v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
[2013] HCA 1
(2013) 249 CLR 435 (at 443 [6], 443–444 [9] per French CJ, Crennan and
Kiefel JJ).
227 The central question is whether the impugned conduct, viewed as a whole,
has a sufficient tendency to lead a person exposed to
the conduct into error,
that is, to form an erroneous assumption or conclusion about some fact or
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v TPG Internet Pty
[2020] FCAFC 130
(2020) 278 FCR 450
(at 458–459 [22] per Wigney,
O’Bryan and Jackson JJ). Conduct is likely to mislead or deceive if there
is a real and
not remote possibility of it doing so:
Global Sportsman Pty Ltd
v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd
(1984) 2 FCR 82 (at 87 per Bowen CJ, Lockhart
and Fitzgerald JJ);
(at 459 [22(a)]).
of the ACL does not expressly identify what persons or class
of persons should be considered as the possible victims for the purpose
deciding whether conduct is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or
deceive. As such, as Gibbs CJ explained in
Parkdale Custom Built Furniture
Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd
[1982] HCA 44
(1982) 149 CLR 191
(at 198–199),
consideration must be given to the nature of the particular conduct in issue,
and the persons or class of persons
likely to be affected by the conduct.
229 Where, as here, the impugned conduct is directed to the public generally,
or a section of the public, the question of whether
the conduct is “likely
to mislead or deceive” must be approached at a level of abstraction. The
Court must consider the
likely characteristics of the persons who comprise the
relevant class to whom the conduct is directed, and the likely effect of the
conduct on ordinary or reasonable members of the class, disregarding reactions
that might be regarded as extreme or fanciful:
Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v
Nike International Ltd
[2000] HCA 12
(2000) 202 CLR 45
[102]–[103] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby Hayne and
Callinan JJ);
(at 458–459 [22]).
230 Once the effect of the impugned conduct on the hypothetical reasonable or
ordinary member of the class of prospective purchasers
has been determined, the
issue of whether the conduct had the character of being misleading will have
been “determined for
the class, that is, the whole class”:
v DKSH Australia Pty Ltd
[2011] FCAFC 98
(2011) 280 ALR 639
680–681 [206] per Greenwood J, with whom Tracey J agreed at 693 [272]). It
is not necessary also to demonstrate that “a
not insignificant
number” of reasonable persons within the relevant class would be misled:
(at 459 [23]);
Trivago NV v Australian Competition and Consumer
[2020] FCAFC 185
(2020) 384 ALR 496
(at 547–549
[192]–[193] per Middleton, McKerracher and Jackson JJ).
231 Importantly, I should stress that while a
finding that a representation made to a class of consumers was likely to mislead
or reasonable members of that class will generally be sufficient to
establish a contravention of
of the ACL, it does not
necessarily follow that all members of the class to whom the representation was
directed are entitled to
relief. In order to establish, relevantly, an
entitlement to damages under s 236 of the ACL, each member would need to
that the group member suffered loss “because of” the
contravening conduct, typically by proof of detrimental reliance
on the relevant
misrepresentations. The applicants accept that the determination of an
entitlement to relief in respect of misleading
and deceptive conduct can be made
in respect of the applicants’ claims. However, in relation to group
members, relief is a
matter for separate determination at a later date.
D.2.2 Examining the representations
The Vehicle Representations and the DPF System
Representations
reason of the referee’s conclusions, TMCA accepts that the DPF System
Representations breached the statutory norms in
of the ACL. TMCA therefore accepts that
the DPF System in the Relevant Vehicles was: defective, not of good quality, not
not durable; had a propensity to fail and was unable to complete a
regeneration cycle with sufficient regularity to prevent the DPF
from becoming
partially or completely blocked.
233 TMCA resists the same conclusion in respect of the Vehicle
Representations on a single basis, namely the false distinction drawn
on the one hand, and goods that contain a defective
on the other hand. Indeed, TMCA submits that “the
failings of the DPF System in any particular vehicle did not make the
representations
misleading”. This
argument should be rejected for the reasons explained above: see [
]. In any event, TMCA’s
interpretation of the Vehicle Representations cannot survive the application of
the principles set out
above (at [
]), which call for consideration of
a reasonable and ordinary prospective consumer
of a Relevant Vehicle
would have understood the Vehicle Representations to mean. I am satisfied that
the reasonable and ordinary
consumer would understand the representation that
“the [Relevant] Vehicles were ... in their design and manufacturing, not
defective” to mean that
the components that comprise
the Relevant
Vehicles were, in their design and manufacturing, not defective.
The Future Vehicle Representations and the Future DPF System
Representations
234 It is convenient to
address the Future Vehicle Representations and the Future DPF System
Representations together. These representations
were misleading having regard to
the findings regarding the Core Defect and the Defect Consequences.
235 TMCA’s remaining contention is that the Future Vehicle
Representations and the Future DPF System Representations were made
reasonable grounds. TMCA concedes that the Future DPF System Representations
were made without reasonable grounds “from
December 2016”, but
submits that for some period of time during the investigation of the DPF issues,
it had reasonable grounds
for making the Future DPF System Representations so
that they were not false, misleading, deceptive or liable to mislead the public.
236 These representations are properly characterised as representations with
respect to future matters. In respect of representations
that pertain to future
of the ACL is enlivened which, by virtue of
, dictates that
such a representation is misleading unless the person has reasonable grounds
upon which to make it and, by virtue
deems that the maker of the
representation does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation,
unless evidence is adduced
to the contrary. The effect of the deeming provision
is to place an evidential burden on TMCA to point to evidence of
reasonable grounds for the making of the impugned future representations:
Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GetSwift
(at [2144]–[2163] per Lee J), which concerned the analogous provision
Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001
237 In response to the allegation that TMCA lacked reasonable grounds for
making the Future Vehicle Representations and Future DPF
System Representations,
TMCA pleads (see D2FASOC at [87]):
... the fact that some owners of DPF Vehicles experienced some DPF Issues does
not mean that TMCA did not have reasonable grounds
for making the Admitted
Future Vehicle Representations [and Future DPF System Representations] in
circumstances where:
(i) the DPF Issues were not safety related;
(ii) TMCA has reimbursed Dealers so that the repair of the DPF Issues are
provided free of charge to Group Members;
(iii) TMCA has continued to investigate the DPF Issues and validate and
implement enhancements to DPF Vehicles; and
(iv) TMCA has implemented the Customer Redress Scheme referred to in paragraph
82(b)(ii) above.
238 Further, in closing submissions, the following was advanced.
239 In respect of the Future DPF System Representations, reliance is placed
on the fact that production of each type of Relevant Vehicle
commenced in June
and July 2015 and at that stage, TMCA received and started to sell vehicles
which had been manufactured by TMC
and Toyota Thailand: AF [2]. There was no
reason, it is said, for TMCA to be aware of any difficulty with the DPF System,
did not design or manufacture the DPF System or the Relevant Vehicles
and, as Mr Nelson’s evidence is said to demonstrate,
very few vehicles
initially presented to dealers with DPF issues. TMCA points to the fact that it
immediately commenced an investigation
into the issues, escalating the matter to
TMC, as designer and manufacturer of the Relevant Vehicles, in circumstances
where it was
responsible for the costs of the various repairs, field fixes and
countermeasures which were rolled out. In respect of the Future
Representations, TMCA once again deploys the reoccurring argument that
defectiveness of the DPF System does not translate
to a conclusion that the
Relevant Vehicles were defective. TMCA accepts that from December 2016, when the
first countermeasure was
released, it no longer had reasonable grounds for
making the Future DPF System Representations.
240 These submissions must be rejected when one considers the applicable
legislative framework.
, when analysed, nothing in TMCA’s defence purports to
identify any
reasonable grounds
that existed and were relied upon by TMCA
at the time it made the future representations. Rather, what is put forward is a
of mitigating circumstances, which appear to suggest that even if the
future representations were misleading, TMCA has sought to
make right its
wrongs. Those contentions have no legal relevance in relation to the question of
whether TMCA had reasonable grounds
for the representations it made with respect
to future matters: cf
Sykes v Reserve Bank of Australia
[1998] FCA 1405
(1998) 88 FCR 511
(at 513‑–514 per Heerey J, with whom Sundberg J agreed at 521);
(at [2158]–[2160] per Lee J).
, the matters relied upon by TMCA are insufficient to
discharge its evidentiary burden. The findings of the referee indicate that
inadequate investigations were carried out during the “design, development
and validation stages of the [Relevant] [V]ehicles’
development”:
First Referee’s Report (at [45]). TMCA has not brought forward any
evidence explaining the steps (if any)
that were taken, prior to the supply of
the Relevant Vehicles to consumers, to ensure that there was a reasonable basis
to represent
to consumers, for example, that those vehicles would not be
defective, and would be of good quality, reliable, durable and suitable
in any driving environment. TMCA simply emphasises the steps taken in pursuit of
a remedy for the Core Defect. Mr Nelson,
being TMCA’s only fact witness,
frankly admitted that he had no relevant involvement in the marketing of the
Relevant Vehicles:
243 TMCA has failed to discharge its evidential burden under
ACL. The future representations made by TMCA were made without reasonable
For completeness, I note that this
conclusion is put beyond doubt by the matters summarised in the
applicants’ closing submissions
(at [203]–[224]).
D.3 The omissions case
addition to the misrepresentations case, the applicants allege that TMCA engaged
in misleading conduct because of its failure
to disclose, or adequately
disclose, the following matters to prospective purchasers or persons acquiring a
Relevant Vehicle:
(1) the existence, nature and extent of the Core Defect in the Relevant
(2) the Defect Consequences;
(3) that the Core Defect had not been remedied; and
(4) from February 2016, TMCA knew of the Core Defect and its consequences.
245 This conduct is said to be misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead
or deceive, in contravention of
of the ACL and liable to mislead the public
in contravention of
of the ACL.
246 TMCA accepts that it did not disclose the Core Defect, the Defect
Consequences, TMCA’s knowledge of such, or that Relevant
Vehicles had not
been remedied, to the public at large. At the same time, TMCA appears to contend
that so long as it was working
to fix the problems plaguing the DPF System, and
so long as it intended to fix such problems under warranty, it had no obligation
to disclose those problems to prospective consumers.
247 The failure to disclose information may constitute misleading conduct,
including where, viewed objectively, there is a reasonable
expectation that
certain facts would, if they exist, be disclosed. As French CJ and Kiefel J
explained in
Miller & Associates Insurance Broking Pty Ltd v BMW
Australia Finance Ltd
[2010] HCA 31
(2010) 241 CLR 357
(at 369–370
[20]), “[t]he judgment which looks to a reasonable expectation of
disclosure as an aid to characterising
non-disclosure as misleading or
deceptive is objective.” Further, proof of the defendant’s
knowledge of the fact that
ought to have been disclosed is not necessary to
establish misleading or deceptive conduct by omission, but is nevertheless a
circumstance, including where disclosure would reasonably be expected
of a fact if that fact were known to the relevant party:
Johnson Tiles Pty
Ltd v Esso Australia Ltd
[2000] FCA 1572
(2000) 104 FCR 564
(at 591 [66]
per French J, with whom Beaumont J agreed at 568 [1], and Finkelstein J agreed
at 603 [99]). Thus, a failure to disclose
may be misleading even where the
failure to disclose was not deliberate.
248 In circumstances where TMCA had made continuing representations that the
Relevant Vehicles contained a DPF System that was not
(and would not be)
defective, there existed a reasonable expectation that if the DPF System in the
Relevant Vehicles was in fact
defective, that matter would be disclosed. That
expectation is even stronger in circumstances where TMCA
System was defective. Similarly, in circumstances where TMCA had made a
continuing representation that the Relevant Vehicles
were suitable for use in
any driving environment, there existed a reasonable expectation that if the
Relevant Vehicles were not,
in fact, suitable for all reasonably expected
conditions of normal operation and use in the Australian market, that matter
be disclosed.
249 For completeness, I note that TMCA’s efforts to fix the problems
cannot affect my assessment of whether it was misleading
not to disclose those
problems to prospective purchasers before they acquired a Relevant Vehicle.
250 The omissions case succeeds.
D.4 Determining the misleading and deceptive conduct case on a
common basis
251 TMCA submits that,
much like its contention in respect of the acceptable quality case, it is not
open to the Court to determine
the misleading and deceptive conduct case on a
common basis.
252 TMCA’s core submission is that there is a need to distinguish
between representations which are directed to the
public at large
representations which are directed to a
section of the public
former case, it is said that the question is entirely objective, and it is not
necessary to prove the conduct in question
misled or deceived
anyone. In the latter case, however, it is said that the only basis upon which
any group member can recover damages
is if they can demonstrate the misleading
or deceptive conduct was
to them and they relied on such
253 It is common ground that the question of reliance demands a subjective
inquiry dependent on the individual group member. TMCA
submits, however, that
the subjective element in the second stage of the inquiry influences the first
stage, meaning that in this
case, the question of liability cannot be determined
on a common basis.
254 In support of this contention, reliance is placed on the discussion of
French CJ in
Campbell v Backoffice
. There, his Honour stated, in respect
of s 42 of the
Fair Trading Act 1987
(NSW) (at 318–319
[24]–[26]) that:
24. The question whether conduct is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead
or deceive within the meaning of s 42 of the
Fair Trading Act
logically anterior to the question whether a person has suffered loss or damage
thereby for the purposes of
The distinction between characterisation of
the conduct and determination of the causation of the claimed loss said to
result from
it must be maintained. In so saying, it is necessary to acknowledge
that there may be practical overlaps in the resolution of these
distinct questions. The characterisation of conduct may involve assessment of
its notional effects, judged by reference
to its context. The same contextual
factors may play a role in determining causation.
26. This Court has drawn a practical distinction between the approach to
characterisation of conduct as misleading or deceptive when
the public is
involved, on the one hand, and where the conduct occurs in dealings between
individuals on the other. In the former
case, the sufficiency of the connection
between the conduct and the misleading or deception of prospective purchasers
be approached at a level of abstraction not present where the case
is one involving an express untrue representation allegedly made
identified individuals”. Where the conduct is directed to members of a
class in a general sense, then the characterisation
enquiry is to be made with
respect to a hypothetical individual “isolate[d] by some criterion”
as a “representative
member of that class”.
In the case of an
individual it is not necessary that he or she be reconstructed into a
hypothetical, “ordinary” person.
Characterisation may proceed by
reference to the circumstances and context of the questioned conduct.
state of knowledge of the person to whom the conduct is directed may be
relevant, at least in so far as it relates to the content
and circumstances of
the conduct.
(Footnotes omitted, emphasis added).
255 TMCA contends that in the current circumstances, the Court is concerned
with conduct directed to identified individuals, meaning
it is necessary to have
regard to the surrounding facts and circumstances of the conduct in determining
whether it was misleading
or deceptive. For example, it is said that if a
particular group member received information from a dealer about the DPF System,
that may affect whether TMCA’s conduct towards that group member was
misleading as a whole, not just whether the group member
relied on the
256 It is said that this distinction is further evident in my reasoning in
Lloyd v Belconnen Lakeview Pty Ltd
[2019] FCA 2177
(2019) 377 ALR 234
where I stated (at 330–331 [378]–[380]):
378. It became apparent that at the commencement of the hearing there was a
recognition by both parties that there were certain deficiencies
in the Merck
orders that had initially been proposed by consent. This is not an unexpected
development in class actions as the intense
preparation prior to the
commencement of the initial trial and the hearing itself can lend clarity to
identifying what, in truth,
are the common, or largely common, contested issues.
The parties recognised that this was such a case for at least two reasons.
issue that arose has some importance. Despite advancing
written submissions which tended to meet the misleading and deceptive conduct
case at a level of generality as if it was being determined on behalf of all
group members, the respondents in both cases accepted
(indeed, at times,
stressed) the prospect that the determination of a misleading and deceptive
conduct case, or an unconscionability
case, in relation to a representative
applicant, will not be determinative of the case that may be made by an
individual group member.
They were correct to do so.
Individual group members in both proceedings may have a range of
individual circumstances, which may be relevant to the circumstances
determining whether there has been contravention of a relevant statutory norm
and, if so, whether casually related loss was suffered
(Footnotes omitted, Emphasis added).
257 Relying on these authorities, TMCA submits that there would be no purpose
served by the Court resolving whether the various Representations
omissions conduct) were misleading or deceptive on a generalised basis, in
circumstances where it will later need to characterise
the conduct and determine
reliance upon it in respect of a particular group member.
258 I disagree.
259 The reason why such conduct can be characterised as misleading without
reference to individual circumstances is because the pleaded
conduct with which
I am presently concerned was directed at a
class of persons
, rather than
conduct directed to any identified individual: the representations were made in
the course of TMCA’s marketing
of the Relevant Vehicles, not in dealings
between TMCA and any particular group member. This is the critical point of
to what the Chief Justice was saying in
Campbell v Backoffice
and what I was saying in
. The question of whether the impugned
conduct was misleading is to be assessed by reference to its effect upon a
hypothetical reasonable
or ordinary member of the class of persons to whom it
was directed. It is not necessary to consider whether any
group member was in fact misled. No further factual or legal enquiry is
necessary in order to determine, on a common basis, the question
TMCA’s conduct in making the DPF System Representations contravened
(1)(a) and (g), or
of the ACL.
260 It should be noted that TMCA has conceded that in making the DPF System
Representations, it engaged in conduct that was in contravention
(1)(a) and (g), and
of the ACL, without the need to enquire into the
individual circumstances of any particular group members: see [
]. It is passing strange that TMCA now
submits, in respect of the pleaded Vehicle Representations, that it is necessary
into the factual circumstances of each individual purchaser before
the Court can characterise TMCA’s pleaded conduct as contravening
statutory norm.
261 But what I have said about determining the pleaded contravening conduct
on a common basis ought not to be misunderstood. To repeat,
I am dealing with
the appropriate characterisation and legal consequence of specified conduct
directed to a class, not individuals.
The finding I make as to this common issue
will bind TMCA as a party (in accordance with ordinary principles of issue
estoppel) and
will also bind group members (but only because of an order I will
make under s 33ZB of the Act creating a “statutory estoppel”
relation to those non-parties). The group members have the benefit of this
finding, to the extent it is relevant in resolving
their individual controversy
with TMCA. Although on the facts it appears unlikely, as a matter of theory, the
common conduct found
to be misleading may be qualified by some circumstance
bespoke to a group member which could conceivably bear upon whether, having
regard to all the circumstances, what occurred could successfully result in a
claim for statutory compensation for misleading
and deceptive conduct. In
theory, individual circumstances may not only bear upon questions of causation,
but also upon whether specific
conduct directed to an individual group member by
TMCA pleaded in an individual case was, having regard to all the circumstances,
appropriately characterised as being misleading.
262 But there is obvious utility in determining, on a common basis, the issue
of whether TMCA engaged in misleading conduct, even
if the questions of
causation, reliance and damage in relation to this aspect of the case are
required to be dealt with on an individual
basis. Needless to say, the answers
to common questions generally will likely obviate the need for group members to
prove that TMCA
engaged in misleading conduct for two reasons:
group members will also have the benefit of the common findings in relation to
the acceptable quality case; and
, the general ignorance of the
Core Defect and the Defect Consequences suggests all group members were in a
relevantly identical position
(unless for some reason, not thus far revealed,
TMCA can point to something about their individual case which suggests an
group member was not mislead and causation of loss is not
established).
E LOSS AND DAMAGE
the residuum of the liability case determined, it is necessary to turn to the
question of loss and damage. In this section,
I will deal with the claims of
group members generally, before considering the individual claim of DCS in
of the damages claim of group members in issue at the initial trial
264 The applicants allege that group members have suffered loss and damage
resulting from the Relevant Vehicles failing to comply
with the statutory
guarantee under s 54 of the ACL. The pleading seeks damages from TMCA for
two kinds of loss under s 272 of the
ACL, namely:
(1) under s 272(1)(a), damages for the reduction in value of each Relevant
Vehicle resulting from the failure to comply with s 54
of the ACL; and
(2) under s 272(1)(b), other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage suffered
because of the failure to comply with s 54 of the ACL,
including excess
taxes, excess financing costs, excess fuel costs and costs incurred in having
the Relevant Vehicle serviced or repaired
on account of the Core Defect.
265 Not all of these claims for relief fall to be wholly determined at the
initial trial. Nor does the question of whether group members
are entitled to
damages caused by TMCA’s misleading and deceptive conduct under s 236 of
the ACL arise for determination. Instead,
at the initial trial, the applicants
seek the following relief on behalf of group members:
(1) an award of aggregate damages (whether in the form of a total aggregate
amount or a specified formula applicable to each group
member) for any reduction
in value of the Relevant Vehicles resulting from the failure of the Relevant
Vehicles to comply with the
statutory guarantee (save for in respect of the 2020
Field Fix Group Members) (
reduction in value damages
(2) an award of aggregate damages (whether in the form of a total aggregate
amount or a specified formula applicable to each group
member) for the excess
GST that all group members paid in connexion with acquiring the Relevant
GST damages
266 The damages claim on behalf of group members raises a number of contested
legal issues that affect both the question of whether
the alleged categories of
loss and damage have been suffered, and if so, the amount of such loss and
damage. I will deal with the
entitlement to reduction in value damages first,
before turning to consider the claim for GST damages.
E.2 Reduction in value damages
267 The claim for damages against TMCA for the failure of the Relevant
Vehicles to comply with the statutory guarantee under s 54
of the ACL is
brought on behalf of group members under s 271(1). The kinds of damages
that may be recovered in an action under s
271(1) are described by
s 272. In particular, s 272(1)(a) provides for the recovery of
reduction in value damages:
272 Damages that may be recovered by action against manufacturers of
(1) In an action for damages under this Division, an affected person in relation
to goods is entitled to recover damages for:
(a) any reduction in the value of the goods, resulting from the failure to
comply with the guarantee to which the action relates,
below whichever of the
following prices is lower:
(i) the price paid or
payable by the consumer for the goods;
(ii) the average retail price of the goods at the time of supply ...
268 An “affected person” who may claim damages under
s 272(1)(a) is defined by s 2(1) as including: (a) a consumer who
acquires the goods; (b) a person who acquires the goods from the consumer (other
than for the purpose of re‑supply); or (c)
a person who derives title to
the goods through or under the consumer. All group members satisfy this
definition in one way or another
]. Those who acquired their Relevant
Vehicle from TMCA or a dealer fall within (a). Those who acquired their Relevant
Vehicle second-hand
in a private sale fall within (b).
269 The damages formula in s 272(1)(a) comprises three key steps:
(1) ascertaining
whether or not
the pleaded failure to comply with the
statutory guarantee caused the value of the goods in question (here the Relevant
to be reduced below the lower of the two prices mentioned in ss
272(1)(a)(i) and (ii) (
identifying any reduction in value
(2) if so, determining the
by which the failure to comply with the
statutory guarantee caused the value to be reduced below the lower of those
quantifying the reduction in value
(3) the practical step of calculating the reduction in value in respect of the
goods found not to be of acceptable quality (
applying the reduction in
270 Before turning to consider these issues, it is necessary to resolve some
issues of construction.
E.2.1 The proper construction of s 272(1)(a) of the
key questions of principle remain in dispute in relation to the construction of
s 272(1)(a):
(1) how does one conceptualise “reduction in value”;
(2) the meaning of “reduction in the value”;
(3) the point in time by reference to which the reduction in value must be
assessed; and
(4) whether information obtained after the time of supply can be taken into
272 I will consider each of these issues in turn.
Conceptualising “reduction in value”
273 It is convenient to
commence by noting one point of clarification at a conceptual level.
274 The phrase “reduction in the value of
the goods” entails an objective concept of value. It is not a subjective
such as the reduction in value to the individual consumer. The relevant
question is what a hypothetical reasonable purchaser –
or the cognate
concept of what a willing (but not anxious) purchaser – would pay,
assuming the purchaser was fully acquainted
with the goods including the Core
Defect and the Defect Consequences. This way of approaching “value”
finds support in
, where Derrington J (at 769–770 [301])
postulated the notion of “putative purchaser” or “notional
purchaser”,
and asked what that person would have been prepared to pay
assuming knowledge of the defect. Put another way, the question is what
would need to
have been offered
to sell the goods to the hypothetical
reasonable consumer.
275 The question is not what the manufacturer or supplier would have been
prepared to sell
the goods for assuming awareness of the Core Defect by
hypothetical reasonable purchasers. Nor is it assessed by analysing what price
willing but not anxious buyers and sellers would agree upon, which was the test
HTW Valuers v Astonland Pty Ltd
[2002] HCA 54
(2004) 217 CLR 640
661 [46] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Heydon JJ) in relation to
valuing a shopping centre. Unlike a shopping centre,
which is a single asset
that exists in both the actual world and the hypothetical “but for”
world, mass produced vehicles
could theoretically be subject to different
dynamics where there is a change in demand. For example, as Dr Rossi’s
indicates, the volume of Relevant Vehicles sold in the “but
for” world would be significantly lower if the counterfactual
exercise is
approached on the basis of an assumption that TMCA can engage in profit
maximising behaviour, such as by reducing its
volume to maximise profit (that
is, not manufacturing some of the vehicles). This was common ground between Dr
Rossi and Mr Boedeker:
see T320.26–35; 328.7–28; 336.1–10;
337.32–41; 339.30–340.24.
276 What the Court must do is assume that in the “but for” world,
the Relevant Vehicles were manufactured and had to be
supplied in Australia.
Section 272(1)(a) calls for an assessment of “any reduction in the value
of the goods”. The term
“the goods” refers to the goods that
were supplied. Here, “the goods” that were supplied are 264,170
Vehicles. Accordingly, the question in this case is what price would
need to have been offered by TMCA in order to sell all 264,170
Vehicles, assuming market participants were aware of the Core Defect. At a
conceptual level, this is the price point described
by Mr Boedeker, namely the
point at which the demand curve for Relevant Vehicles (assuming awareness of the
Core Defect) intersects
with the quantity actually sold, namely 264,170:
T320.25–30; 332.25–27, 36–38; 334.13–15.
The meaning of “reduction in the value”
comes the more concrete question: how does one define the “reduction in
value”? TMCA submits that the concept
of reduction in value can only be
looked at through the prism of market data. By contrast, the applicants rely on
the expert reports
of Mr Stockton and Mr Boedeker who, respectively, quantify a
reduction in value by means of “repair cost” (that is, equating
reduction in value arising from the Core Defect with the cost of repairing that
defect) and by the change in consumers’
“willingness to pay”
). TMCA raises a number of criticisms in respect of the
applicants’ approach.
278 It is convenient to set out those criticisms first.
, TMCA submits that Mr Stockton’s analysis is circular
and involves reading “reduction in value” as, at all times,
equivalent to the cost of repair. As a matter of statutory interpretation, it is
said, such a reading is not available given various
parts of the ACL, including
s 271(6), expressly refer to the concept of repairing goods and had the
legislature intended to equate
“reduction in value” with
“repair costs”, s 272 could easily have provided as much.
280 Moreover, it is said that Mr Stockton’s method of using the average
cost of DPF repairs as a “proxy” for the
reduction in value of the
Relevant Vehicles at the time of purchase must be rejected in the light of Dr
Pleatsikas’ evidence,
namely that:
(1) Mr Stockton’s approach of using repair costs as a proxy is erroneous
where there is a much firmer base for an economic
analysis of loss: that is,
readily available market sales data: Stockton and Pleatsikas Joint Report (at
(2) the amount spent to repair a defect may be higher than the loss in value
from the defect or lower and there is no foundation
in logic or economics to
determine the comparison simply by reference to the defect and the consequence,
as opposed to market value:
Stockton and Pleatsikas Joint Report (at
[22]–[23]). Dr Pleatsikas said during the concurrent evidence (at
T216.11–17)
[a]s noted in my discussion of warranty repair cost, there is no necessary
economic link between the cost of the [2020 Field Fix]
and effects on vehicle
value, and Mr Stockton has not provided any such link. Instead, Mr
Stockton’s repair cost model which
uses both a hypothetical vehicle and a
hypothetical and non-realistic transaction, appears to rest on noneconomic
assumptions that
are not founded on economic theory, and have no discernible
link to reduction in market price, if any, for the affected vehicles.
(3) it is untenable to treat the amount that a manufacturer is prepared to pay
under warranty as a proxy for reduction in value,
given that the amount that
manufacturers may be willing to pay does not necessarily relate to the specific
effect that such repairs
may have on the marketplace values of the particular
vehicles: Stockton and Pleatsikas Joint Report (at [23]); and
(4) reliance on Mr Stockton’s analysis also suffers from the logical
problem that TMCA paid the cost of repairs, and if recovery
on the basis of
repair costs were awarded by the Court, group members who have had repairs
undertaken will have received the full
benefit of the value of those repairs
will be paid the cost of those repairs, with the issue compounded if
a group member sold the vehicle, as the new owner would also
be a group member:
Stockton and Pleatsikas Joint Report (at [24]).
281 In support of this position, TMCA draws an
analogy with contractual damages. It is said that in cases of contractual
courts may be asked to consider whether to award compensation on two
alternative bases: that the damage caused be rectified, or that
the change in
market value by reason of the damage be paid. TMCA points to the House of Lords
decision in
Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth
344, where the contract specified that the pool should have a diving area
seven feet and six inches deep. Upon completion,
the pool was suitable for
diving, but the diving area was only six feet deep. There was evidence at the
trial that the shortfall
in depth had not decreased the value of the pool, and
that the pool was safe and suitable for diving. The only method of achieving
pool of the required depth would have been to demolish the existing pool and
reconstruct a new one at a cost of £21,560. The
House of Lords found that
such a cost would have been wholly disproportionate to the disadvantage of
having a pool of a depth of
only six foot and held that the cost of
reconstruction was not recoverable.
282 It is said that while none of the authorities concerning contractual
damages apply directly to the present case, there is a relevant
analogy between
these proceedings and
there was a defect in the DPF System in the Relevant Vehicles, but there is no
suggestion that the Relevant Vehicles were other
than perfectly safe to drive.
It is said that the secondary market evidence establishes that there was no
reduction in the value
of the Relevant Vehicles as at the date of purchase
and the cost of repair or rectification of the
Relevant Vehicles is borne by TMCA and not the consumer (meaning group members
not bear any cost in connexion with the rectification of the defect). That
is, the case is analogous to the facts at trial in
, where the
Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff would use any damages award to
rectify the pool. It is said that there is no
basis upon which the Court can
assess how the costs incurred by TMCA in order to repair the defects compare to
the objective amount
that is necessary to fix any individual defect.
, in respect of Mr Boedeker’s analysis, it is said
that using WTP as a proxy for reduction in value is erroneous as it accounts
only for the demand side, not the supply side.
284 TMCA relies on Mr Rossi’s criticism that, as a matter of economics,
the only meaningful and logically defensible measure
of value is by a market
price, defined through the computation of both supply and demand, that is, WTP
is only half of the equation:
Rossi Report (at [12], [49]–[55]);
T343.15–21, 41–46; T380.5. As Dr Rossi remarked in Dube JP and Rossi
Handbook of the Economics of Marketing
(North Holland, 2019):
It should be emphasized that conjoint analysis can only estimate demand.
Conjoint survey data, alone, cannot be used to compute market
equilibrium
outcomes such as market prices or equilibrium product positioning in
characteristics space. Clearly, supply assumptions
and cost information must be
added to conjoint data in order to compute equilibrium quantities. Conjoint
practitioners have chosen
the unfortunate term “market simulation”
to describe demand predictions based on conjoint analyses. These practices are
not simulations of any market outcome and must be understood for their
limitations as we discuss below.
285 It is said that while Mr Boedeker accepts this principle in parts of
his evidence, he has refused to adjust the supply side in
for” world; instead proceeding on the basis that TMCA and Toyota dealers
would have been forced to sell the
same number of Relevant Vehicles, albeit at
prices reduced in the range of 20 to 40 per cent: T344.30–345.10. That is
it is said, as all economic forces are still functioning unhindered
save that the defect is disclosed. As Dr Rossi said during his
characteristically forthright style cross-examination (at T329.18–23):
It’s not a dispute between Mr Boedeker and myself. It’s a dispute
between Mr Boedeker and the profession of economics.
So what does Mr Boedeker
want to do? Mr Boedeker wants to ignore supply altogether, any of the factors
that influence the supply
of products, and simply compute the vertical
difference between the blue demand curve and the yellow, which is the reduced
when the defect has become open and known in the marketplace ...
286 Further, TMCA relies upon the reasoning in
, where Stevenson
J concluded (at [240]–[244]) that a survey that only measures WTP is not a
proxy for market value under s
272(1)(a) of the ACL:
Only measured willingness to pay
240. The first is that, as Professor Baddeley accepted, the Discrete Choice
Experiments were not directed to ascertaining the market
value of the vehicles
in question. Rather they were directed to ascertaining a purchaser’s
willingness to pay for the vehicle;
or the “value to the consumer”
of the vehicle. Thus, the Discrete Choice Experiments were directed only to the
side of a transaction that, in the real world, would have a supply side
241. It is no doubt true that in the real world there would not be a market for
vehicles known to have a defective airbag, not least
because no rational and
responsible vehicle manufacturer would offer such vehicles for sale.
242. But it does not follow that, assuming it can be ascertained, a
purchaser’s willingness to pay for a vehicle can be a proxy
vehicle’s market value.
243. The test posited by s 272 of the ACL is expressed in terms of “price
payable” or “average retail price”
and thus in terms of value
in a market of buyers and sellers.
244. The Discrete Choice Experiments were not directed towards this question
and say nothing about market value.
287 TMCA point to the fact that many American courts have also taken the same
view and their pronouncements about the lack of utility
of WTP in assessing
damages are instructive. For example, in a recent US proceeding (
MacDougall v
American Honda Motor Co., Inc,
(CD Cal, SACV 17-1079 JGB (DFMx), 11
September 2020)), the US District Court of California explained the vice of WTP
simplest terms” when “striking out” the expert
report of Mr Boedeker in that proceeding (at 4):
Put in the simplest terms, measuring damages solely through the lens of a
consumer’s WTP overestimates a consumer’s damages
because even if a
consumer has a reduced WTP for a defect or undesirable product, the consumer
does not suffer any loss if their
reduced WTP remains greater than the actual
cost of the product. The integration of accurate and realistic supply-side
considerations
– such as the actual price of a product – therefore
plays a critical role in producing an accurate measure of damages
choice-based conjoint analysis.
288 Other US courts have rejected the evidence of Mr Boedeker on this
In Re: General Motors Llc Ignition Switch Litigation,
407 F Supp 3d 212 (SDNY
Re General Motors Llc Ignition Switch
Litigation,
427 F Supp 3d 374 (SDNY
In Re: Emerson Electric Co.
Wet/Dry Vac Marketing and Sales Litigation,
(ED Mo ED, 4:12MD2382 HEA, 28
October 2021).
289 In short, it is said that WTP addresses the demand side but does not
address the supply side; that is, the willingness of the
supplier to sell at a
particular price. It is self-evident, in TMCA’s submission, that a
consumer will always be willing to
pay less, but whether a supplier will supply
at that price is another matter. Hence, a market price cannot be derived from
290 There is always a danger in overcomplicating statutory concepts,
particularly when expert evidence is involved. After all, it
must be remembered
that the concept of “reduction in value” is a statutory one; expert
evidence, while helpful, cannot
bear upon the proper construction of s
272(1)(a). Similarly, there is a danger in shoehorning s 272(1)(a) into a
definitional corner
with only one precise means of calculation. I accept that in
some cases (perhaps the majority), the concept of reduction in value
may best be
viewed through the prism of market value, but here, where there are issues with
ascertaining market value, it cannot
be said that one should push on, as it
were, and apply a calculation known to be incomplete. TMCA contends that
s 272(1)(a) does
not provide for the use of estimates or proxies. But
nothing in the text of s 272(1)(a) excludes proxies or estimates. Nor was
High Court averse to inexact calculations or estimates of damages based on
true value in
HTW Valuers
(at 663 [50], 664–665 [56]–[57] per
Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Heydon JJ).
291 Indeed, the
of TMA’s contentions that “repair
cost” is not an appropriate methodology for assessing reduction in value
under s 272(1)(a), is difficult to reconcile with the reasoning of
Derrington J in
. In that case, accepting imperfections in
calculation (and no expert evidence having been adduced), his Honour treated the
cost of the good (a vessel) as the
prima facie
amount of the
reduction in value. His Honour stated (at 769–770 [300]–[302]):
300. As at the date the vessel was delivered it was newly constructed and it
can be accepted that it was worth its purchase price
of $4,233,801.03. The
contrary was not suggested by any party and the contract to acquire it appears
to have been an arm’s
length transaction. As will be discussed below, the
value of these types of vessels depreciates rapidly over time and a
determination
of its value as at the date of trial needs to take into account
that decline in value. However, such questions of depreciation are
not relevant
to its value when it was brand new. That being so a relatively rough calculation
can be made as to the value of the
vessel as at the date of supply on the
assumption that the putative purchaser would have been aware of the existence of
the defects
in the vessel as well as the cost of remedying them. On the basis
that the total cost of putting Revive into the condition of a Category
would be $2,995,505.70 (as is discussed below),
prima facie
value as at the date of supply was no more than the purchase price less that
amount or approximately $1,238,295.33.
302. Overall, and accepting that a broad-brush approach is necessary in the
assessment of damages, it is not appropriate for the
Court to hazard a guess as
to the valuation figure of Revive at the date of sale. That is a matter on which
the Court requires expert
evidence and none was adduced at trial. The best that
can be done on the evidence which was adduced is to conclude that, at the date
of the supply, Revive’s value was, at the most, the purchase price less
the cost of undertaking the necessary repairs to render
it fit as a Category A
vessel or $1,238,295.33. The amount of the diminution in value of the vessel is
equal to the cost of repairs
at $2,995,505.70.
292 Further, TMCA’s reliance on
is misplaced.
was a case where the House of Lords found it would be unreasonable to award
the plaintiff its rectification costs in circumstances
where the diminution in
value resulting from the failure to build the pool to the correct depth was nil.
The case does not stand
for the proposition that repair cost cannot be used to
calculate reduction in value resulting from a defect when the amount the
hypothetical
reasonable purchaser would pay is otherwise unknown. Whether or not
it is appropriate to do so is a question of fact.
293 As to the
criticism relating to the use of WTP to measure
reduction in value, it is again necessary to emphasise that Dr Rossi’s
as an economist cannot bear upon the proper construction of
s 272(1)(a). Nor should I be swayed by the approach taken by US Courts
approaching the legal analysis relevant to the application of an Australian
statutory provision: cf
Eastern Express Pty Limited v General Newspapers Pty
(1992) 35 FCR 43
(at 71–72 per Lockhart and Gummow JJ);
Boral Besser Masonry Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer
[2003] HCA 5
(2004) 215 CLR 374
(at 464 [278] per McHugh J). In
any event, the US courts do not speak with one voice on whether WTP is an
appropriate measure of
damages. There are two competing lines of authority, with
one supporting the use of WTP, and the other rejecting it: see
Fisher-Price
Rock ‘N Play Sleeper Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability
, F Supp 3d (WDNY, 2021) (at 6–7). The conclusion reached in
that case at a preliminary stage was as follows (at 7):
What these two lines of cases indicate is that there is a legitimate difference
of opinion, both among judges and experts, about
the significance of supply side
information in calculating loss of value. Mr. Weir’s methodology is not
wrong or “fake”—it
is simply different in a principled way
from Dr. Rossi’s analysis ...
294 The question for the Court in this proceeding is whether, as a matter of
legal principle, it is appropriate to focus on the WTP
of the hypothetical
reasonable consumer when assessing reduction in value loss for the purposes of
s 272(1)(a) of the ACL.
295 The criticism that a consumer still recovers damages notwithstanding that
the level of their reduced individual WTP may exceed
the level at which a
supplier wishes to supply is somewhat of a false issue. The reduction in value
loss arises because the vehicle’s
true value at the time of purchase
(which is objectively assessed) was less than the purchase price, not because
the individual consumer’s
true WTP was less than the purchase price. In
this regard, Mr Boedeker calculated the reduced WTP for the
consumer, which approximates the price decrease that would have been required in
order for TMCA to sell the same number of Relevant
Vehicles with the defect
disclosed. This represents the true value, because it is the price that would
need to have prevailed in
the marketplace in order for the same volume of
vehicles to have been sold in the light of market knowledge of the Core
296 In making these comments, I accept what was
said by Stephenson J in
(at [242]). But it is important not to
conflate reduction in value under s 272(1)(a) with a “market
value” that assumes
a market equilibrium (that is, one that takes into
account both supply and demand forces). As noted above, the correct approach is
to ask at what price TMCA would need to have sold the vehicles in order to sell
the same volume with the defect disclosed. This would
be the relevant
“market value”. That is not to say there are not real issues with Mr
Boedeker’s survey, to which
I will come, but I do not think his method of
examination is meaningless when looking to the statutory concept of reduction in
– it is a helpful indicator.
297 To my mind, it is erroneous to shoehorn any
conception of “reduction in value” as only being able to be derived
comparison to market value. Concepts such as repair cost and WTP are useful
indicators in ascertaining any reduction in value.
The point in time by reference to which reduction in value
damages must be assessed
298 It is common ground
that the damages formula in s 272(1)(a) does not expressly identify the
point in time by reference to which
the reduction in value of the goods is to be
assessed. It is a matter of construction as to what is implied by the
299 The relevant positions of the parties are as follows:
contend that the reduction in value must be assessed
by reference to the time at which the Relevant Vehicle was supplied without
reference to
which occurred subsequently, but that subsequent
information
which bears on the assessment of the value of the goods at
the time of supply can be taken into account; and
contends that the reduction in value must be assessed by
reference to the date on which the loss crystallises, including by reference
the condition of the goods at the time of trial, or events that have occurred
since the acquisition of the Relevant Vehicle. The
kinds of events that TMCA
asserts should be taken into account include the existence of the 2020 Field
Fix, whether and when the
Defect Consequences manifested in a Relevant Vehicle
after purchase and whether group members sold their vehicles (and the prices
achieved for such sales).
300 I have reached the conclusion that the applicants’ construction is
to be preferred. In demonstrating why this is the case,
it is convenient first
to set out the position of TMCA.
301 TMCA submits that there is no hard and fast rule about the date at which
the reduction in value is to be assessed. Rather, the
questions for the Court,
in any s 272 case, are:
(1) whether there has been any reduction in the value of the goods;
(2) whether any part of that reduction in value resulted from the failure to
comply with the statutory guarantee; and
(3) whether that reduction in value takes the value of the goods below the
particular price benchmarks referred to in s 272(1)(a).
302 It is common ground that the price benchmarks can only be assessed at the
time of supply. However, TMCA contends that the first
two enquiries are not so
limited, and the Court is to determine the market value of the Relevant Vehicles
either at the date of supply
and purchase, or, possibly, at a later date,
depending upon the time that the loss of value said to arise crystallises. This
it is said, from the following aspects of the statutory text of s
(1) the opening words of subs 272(1)(a) – “any reduction”
unlike the later parts of the subsection, the reduction in value is
not linked to any particular time period;
(2) in order to recover under s 272, the affected person must suffer a reduction
in the value of the goods “resulting from
the failure to comply with the
guarantee” – this indicates a notion of
loss or damage
by reference to the failure to comply, rather than a hypothetical calculation at
the time of purchase, regardless
of the circumstances of the affected person;
(3) while the price concepts in ss 272(1)(a)(i) and (ii) are anchored to the
time of sale, the concept of “value of the goods,
resulting from the
failure to comply” is not; and
(4) section 272(3) provides that s 272(1)(b) does not apply to
suffered through a reduction in the value of the goods – this
emphasises the fact that
loss or damage
from reduction in value of the
goods is the key focus of s 272(1)(a).
303 In this respect, TMCA relies on the reasoning of Gleeson CJ, McHugh,
Gummow, Kirby and Heydon JJ in
HTW Valuers,
where their Honours said (at
666–668 [63]–[65]):
Smith New Court Securities Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management)
, a majority of the House of Lords held that ‘‘there can be
circumstances in which it is proper to require a defendant
only to bring into
account the actual proceeds of the asset provided that he has acted reasonably
in retaining it’’.
And Lord Steyn, who reached the same result,
pointed out
that the fundamental rule was that the plaintiff should be
compensated
the rule which turns on an assessment of value is only
a means of giving effect to the overriding compensatory rule
; and that the
valuation of assets as at the date of the transaction is ‘‘simply a
second order rule applicable only where
the valuation method is
employed’’. He went on:
‘‘If that method is inapposite, the court is entitled simply to
assess the loss flowing directly from the transaction
without any reference to
the date of transaction or indeed any particular date. Such a course will be
appropriate whenever the overriding
compensatory rule requires
There is certainly no reason why an approach of that kind is not open under s 82
of the Act.
The deduction of true value at the acquisition date from the
price paid is no more than a guide to the assessment of damages under
Section 82 does not in terms refer to that method, and the width of s 82 permits
other approaches to the assessment of damages so
long as they work no injustice.
The alternative approach advocated by the plaintiff has particular
appropriateness in the present
circumstances. That is because a primary reason
for the common adoption, in assessing damages in deceit, of the test of
the price paid for an asset with its true value when acquired is the
desirability of separating out losses resulting from extraneous
factors in the
later history of the asset.
(Citation omitted, emphasis added).
304 TMCA proffers the following example. Consumer A and Consumer B purchase
mobile phones on the same day for $10. The torch built
into the mobile phone is
defective and does not work. The next day, the market becomes aware the torch
light does not work and the
market for those phones changes such that the market
price is now $8. The two purchasers take different courses:
(1) the torch light is important to Consumer A, who immediately sells the phone
for $8; and
(2) Consumer B does not care about the torch in his phone and is indifferent to
the torch being defective. Consumer B holds onto
the phone for one year and then
wishes to sell it, but during that year, the price of the phone has surged to
$11, by reason of its
305 According to TMCA, on the date of purchase analysis, under s 272,
Consumer A is entitled to recover the $2 loss in value from
the supplier, and
Consumer B is entitled to sell the phone for $1 profit and then claim $2
compensation from the supplier by reason
of the apparent loss in value at the
date of purchase. TMCA submits that it cannot be said that Consumer B has
suffered any loss
from the reduction in value of the phone at that date because
no loss had crystallised.
306 In this respect, reliance is again placed on the
Stevenson J in
. There, his Honour was addressing a case where cars
had been sold with defective Takata airbags, but the airbags had later been
with non-Takata airbags. In the light of the replacement, his Honour
rejected the suggestion that the purchasers had suffered any
loss in value if
there was a failure to comply with the s 54 of the ACL. His Honour said (at
[192]–[194]):
192. The plaintiff’s case concerning “reduction in the value”
directs attention only to events at the time that
the plaintiff purchased the
193. But the question for the purpose of s 272 of the ACL is what damage the
plaintiff has now suffered “for”, that is,
as a result of or by
reason of, any reduction in the value of the vehicle below the purchase price
“resulting from” any
failure by VW to comply with the s 54
194. The question is, what effect has any such failure had on the
plaintiff’s financial position?
307 His Honour went on to say (at [205]):
It is not to the point only to enquire what the “true value” of the
plaintiff’s vehicle was at the date of purchase
and thus whether that
“true value” was less than the purchase price. What matters is the
plaintiff’s position now
that the airbag has been replaced. The effect of
such replacement is that such defect, as may hitherto have affected the
value, has been removed.
308 For these reasons, TMCA submits the appropriate time to assess reduction
in value damages under s 272 is the time at which any
losses crystallised for
any particular group member. It notes that the date of resale or trade-in might
be one such event; the date
when a purchaser who immediately suffered one of the
Defect Consequences returned the vehicle to the dealer may be another. For
individuals
who continue to hold a Relevant Vehicle, it is said that the date of
trial may be the only practical date at which to assess any
such loss. Indeed,
ascertaining the appropriate date of valuation is a matter which must ultimately
depend on what is necessary in
order to assess the damage suffered by a
particular purchaser arising from a reduction in value.
309 This point of contest is ultimately one to be resolved by principles of
statutory construction. To my mind, there are at least
six reasons which support
the proposition that reduction in value is to be assessed by reference to the
time of acquisition.
, the text of s 272(1)(a) indicates a legislative
intention that the assessment is to be made by reference to the time of
acquisition.
The requirement for a reduction in value below the lower of the
prices mentioned in 272(1)(a)(i) and (ii) calls for a comparison
between one of
those prices – which are necessarily “at the time of supply”
– and the value of the goods
taking into account the relevant
non-compliance with the statutory guarantee. It is logical to expect that
Parliament intended this
comparison to be an “apples with apples”
comparison such that both the prices and the “real value” of the
goods are to be assessed by reference to the same point in time, namely the time
of acquisition. To the extent that TMCA asserts
that the chapeau in
s 272(1)(a) is not linked to any particular time period, this should be
rejected. Subclause (a) is a composite
provision that combines the chapeau with
its two comparator prices. There is no indication in the text that the clause
be read as a whole, or that the chapeau should be decoupled from the
point of supply inherent in the two comparator prices: see,
Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural
[2022] FCAFC 25
(at [31] per Jagot, Bromwich and Lee JJ).
, by directing attention to the reduction in value
resulting from the failure to comply with the guarantee below the purchase price
or average retail price at the time of supply, s 272(1)(a) reflects a
legislative intention to compensate the consumer for having
purchased the goods
for more than they were worth. Put another way, s 272(1)(a) compensates the
overpayment made by the consumer
at the time of acquisition. This too is
consistent with an intention to assess value by reference to the time of
acquisition, because
otherwise, the value assessment could be infected by a
range of post-acquisition circumstances that may have caused the value to
increase or decrease, which could distort the assessment of loss. The context
provided by s 272(1)(b) also supports this construction:
it provides for
recovery of “reasonably foreseeable” loss or damage, suggesting the
focus is on the time of supply.
312 TMCA’s suggestion that the words “resulting from the failure
to comply with the guarantee” indicate that
required, and that assessing loss at the time of acquisition would be merely
hypothetical, goes nowhere. There is no dispute
that s 272(1)(a) requires
loss, but loss assessed at the time of acquisition is not merely
hypothetical. By paying more than a Relevant Vehicle is worth, in
circumstances
where a Relevant Vehicle was not of acceptable quality, the consumer suffers
immediate loss.
, this construction means that s 272(1)(a) can be read
harmoniously with s 271(6), which provides that if the manufacturer
the non-compliance by repairing or replacing the good within a
reasonable time after having been required by an affected person to
accordance with an express warranty, the affected person cannot commence an
action for reduction in value damages under
s 272(1)(a). The logical scheme
is as follows: affected persons can bring a claim for damages under
s 271(1) and seek damages of
the kind described in s 272 if the goods
fail to comply with the guarantee in s 54; any reduction in value damages
resulting from
the non-compliance under s 272(1)(a) is calculated by
reference to the time of acquisition without regard to any subsequent repair
that remedied the non-compliance; however, if the manufacturer provided a repair
that remedied the non-compliance
within a reasonable time
after being
required to do so under an express warranty, no reduction in value damages can
be recovered due to s 271(6).
314 To the extent that TMCA asserts that its construction is supported by
s 272(3), which provides that s 272(1)(b) does not apply
damage suffered through a reduction in value of the goods, this submission
should be rejected. The text of s 272(3) says
nothing about timing, and in
any event, it is a “for the avoidance of doubt” provision:
Explanatory Memorandum,
Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law)
Bill (No. 2) 2010
(at [7.124]). It ensures that a consumer cannot avoid the
effect of s 271(6) by seeking to recover reduction in value loss as a
consequential
, two decisions of this Court support the construction
contended for by the applicants, namely
, Perram J (at 433 [880]–[882]) rejected valuation
evidence that assessed the current market value of Ms Capic’s vehicle.
Honour said that such evidence answered the wrong question for the purposes of
s 272(1)(a), whereas the correct question was
what the vehicle was worth on
the date it was acquired: see 433–434 [880]–[884], 435 [890]. Events
that occurred after
the date of acquisition – such as the risks inherent
in the defect coming to pass, or the fact that the manufacturer had repaired
problem – were irrelevant, because “neither bears upon the risk of
failure which existed at the date of the acquisition”:
see 434 [884].
, damages were claimed against the supplier and the
manufacturer of a recreational fishing vessel in circumstances where there had
been a failure to comply with the guarantees under ss 54, 55 and 59 of the
ACL. Derrington J held that the applicant was entitled
to reject the vessel
under s 259(3)(a) and receive a refund of the purchase price from the
supplier: see 769 [297]. In
(at 769 [299]), his Honour considered
whether the applicant would have been entitled to reduction in value damages
from the supplier
under s 259(3)(b) of the ACL had his right to reject the
vessel been lost. Section 259(3)(b) is similar to s 272(1)(a). It
259 Action against suppliers of goods
(3) If the failure to comply with the guarantee cannot be remedied or is a
major failure, the consumer may:
(b) by action against the supplier, recover compensation for any reduction in

by the consumer for the
318 When construing s 259(3)(b), Derrington J observed (at 767 [292])
that the relevant reduction in value – although not made
clear in the
section – is that “which is attributed to the failure of the goods
to comply with the guarantee”.
In that context, his Honour found (at 767
[292]) that “the difference is measured
as at the date of supply
which is the relevant date to consider when ascertaining whether there was a
failure to comply with the guarantee” (emphasis
added). Accordingly, his
Honour assessed the reduction in value as at the date of acquisition: see
769–770 [300]–[302].
Derrington J also took the same approach when
assessing what the reduction in value damages payable by the manufacturer would
been under s 272(1)(a): see 779 [340].
319 TMCA submits that these decisions are either distinguishable or should
not be followed. At a high level of generality, it is simply
said that their
Honours’ reasons were
and/or did not contain any detailed
analysis of the question of timing to assess damages under s 272. I disagree.
Not only does the
reasoning in
align with a
proper construction of s 272 (and for which, as is explained above, reasons are
provided), these cases should be followed
as a matter of comity. This is
particularly so with questions of statutory construction: see
Minister for
Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs v FAK19
[2021] FCAFC 153
(at [14] per Allsop CJ);
BVT20 v Minister for Immigration,
Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs
[2020] FCAFC 222
[62] per Allsop CJ, Moshinsky and O’Callaghan JJ).
, to the extent TMCA relies on
HTW Valuers
for the proposition that the Court must determine the “market
value” of the Relevant Vehicles as at the time any loss
crystallised, this
reliance is misplaced. Quite apart from the fact that focusing on the
“market value” fails to answer
the right question,
concerned s 82 of the TPA, which differs substantially from
s 272(1)(a). Specifically, s 82 entitled recovery for loss or damage
“suffered by” contravening conduct of another person without
referring to a method of damages assessment. By contrast,
s 272(1)(a)
contains an express damages formula, namely the difference between the true
value of the goods and the relevant price
at the time of supply.
321 Further, in any event, TMCA’s argument
is inconsistent with
HTW Valuers
. The High Court in that case still
sought to assess loss as the difference between the price paid and the
value at the time of acquisition, notwithstanding that it rejected assessing
loss as the difference between the price paid and the
that time: see 660–661 [44]‑–[46]. It rejected reliance on
value at the time of acquisition, because the market value was
infected by the imperfect knowledge of the market and hence was not
value: see 661 [45]. There was also no difficulty in that case in assessing
damages by reference to the decline in value closer
to trial when that decline
in value was inherent in the asset and not due to extraneous factors: see
667–668 [65]. It was therefore
indicative of the true value at the time of
acquisition.
322 This also highlights the problem with the
hypothetical example about the mobile phone posed by TMCA, which conflates
value, and impermissibly allows extraneous
subsequent events to affect the analysis. While the subsequent $2 fall in market
may provide evidence of the reduction in value – if it accurately
reflects the true value of the mobile phone at the time of
purchase – it
is not the reason why Consumer A can recover damages. Consumer A is entitled to
reduction in value damages because
he overpaid for the mobile phone to begin
with, not because the market value later fell on account of the defect.
Likewise, the fact
that the market price appreciated by $1 after Consumer
B’s purchase on account of the rarity of the mobile phone does not gainsay
the loss suffered by having overpaid for the mobile phone in the first place.
Had that loss not been suffered – for example,
had Consumer B paid $8
instead of $10 – Consumer B’s profit would have been greater. This
simply reflects the fact that,
when assessed objectively from the perspective of
the hypothetical reasonable consumer, there was an overpayment at the point of
purchase, and therefore a reduction in value. The reduction in value results
regardless of whether an individual like Consumer B
is indifferent to the issue,
because it depends on the hypothetical reasonable consumer, not the
idiosyncratic individual.
323 As to the
analysis of Stevenson J in
[174]–[175]), his Honour’s comments regarding the potential
application of s 272(1)(a) were framed by particular reference
to two matters:
(1) his Honour’s identification of the relevant question as being
“what effect has any such failure had
on the plaintiff’s financial
position?” (at [194]); and (2) his Honour’s finding that this
question must be answered
having regard to events that have happened since the
purchase of the vehicle, such as the provision of a repair and the fact that
risks of the defect had come to pass: see [190]–[191], [197], [200],
[203]–[204]. This should not be taken as suggesting
that these are
generally applicable principles to be applied in all cases involving s
272(1)(a). Such framing of the issues in
reflected the particular
factual circumstances of that case and the way in which the plaintiff sought to
put the claim for reduction
in value damages.
324 Indeed, as appears from [177]–[187] of his Honour’s reasons,
the plaintiff advanced a case on loss and damage that
was not confined to the
statutory measure in s 272(1)(a), but sought to invoke broader notions of
“loss” and “damage”,
including specifically by reference
to events after the supply: see [186], [208]. As to the facts of the case, the
claim for damages
arose in circumstances where the relevant suggested risk with
the airbags was one that would (on the plaintiff’s case) arise
distant point in the future, but before that point had been reached the airbags
in the affected vehicles had been replaced at
no cost. Stevenson J’s
comments regarding the need to consider how “risks evolved into
certainties” (at [191],
HTW Valuers
(at 661 [45] per
Gleeson CJ, McHugh J, Gummow, Kirby and Heydon JJ)), must be read and understood
in this context.
, as was the case in
, the Core Defect in this
proceeding had a propensity to cause certain adverse consequences that would
manifest when the Relevant
Vehicles were driven in line with the High Speed
Driving Pattern. The reduction in value damages sought by group members are
to that common propensity inherent in the Relevant Vehicles on the
date of supply
. This fortifies the view that this loss also can be
assessed on a common basis, because it is based on a propensity common to all
the Relevant Vehicles at the time of acquisition.
326 This construction of s 272(1)(a) has implications for the claim on
behalf of group members. It means that reduction in value damages
assessed by reference to the date of acquisition having regard to the propensity
for the Defect Consequences that was inherent
in the Relevant Vehicles. It also
means these damages do not vary from group member to group member based upon the
extent to which
the Defect Consequences actually manifested.
Whether information obtained after the time of supply can be
taken into account
327 Related to the
former point, the parties are in dispute as to whether evidence of matters which
occur after the date of purchase
can be used in order to assess value at the
date of purchase. The applicants contend that while the Court may take into
account later
acquired information that bears upon the true value of Relevant
Vehicles at the time of acquisition, it cannot take into account
later events
that do not bear upon that value at the time of acquisition. TMCA submits that
the inquiry is not so limited and that
the Court is entitled to consider whether
the risk as at the date of purchase has evolved into certainties at subsequent
328 When properly appreciated, there is a limited difference (if any) between
these two positions. Of course, speaking at a level
of generality, information
as to how the defect played out and the risk evolved into certainties is
relevant – it demonstrates
what in fact the nature of the defect was. That
approach is consistent with the reasoning in
Potts v Miller
[1940] HCA 43
(1940) 64 CLR
(at 299 per Dixon J) and
HTW Valuers
(at 658–659
[39]–[40], 661 [45])
Such an approach is also consistent with the
fact that both Mr Boedeker and Mr Stockton take into account post-purchase
their analysis (such as using repairs carried out after the purchase
date). Further, if the market price of Relevant Vehicles was
initially erroneous
due to unawareness of the defect, but subsequently the market became fully
informed and market prices fell, the
subsequent market prices may provide
information relevant to assessing the true value at the time of acquisition.
This is similar
to what occurred in
HTW Valuers
. By contrast, if a repair
became available four years after the date of acquisition and was implemented
more than a reasonable time
after being requested, this would not be relevant to
the true value at the time of acquisition. The repair was not expected at the
time of acquisition, so it is an extraneous event, irrelevant to the true value
at that time.
329 With these issues of construction resolved, it is necessary to move to
the three stage analysis I identified above, namely: (1)
identifying any
reduction in value; (2) quantifying the reduction in value; and (3) applying the
reduction in value.
E.2.2 Identifying any reduction in value
would already be obvious, the applicants contend that the presence of the Core
Defect in the Relevant Vehicles reduced the
value of the vehicles at the time
they were supplied and each consumer therefore received a vehicle that was less
valuable than the
one they bargained for, resulting in an overpayment.
331 As reflected in the introduction to these reasons, as a matter of common
sense and intuition, that is a sound – indeed,
irresistible –
conclusion. The Core Defect makes the Relevant Vehicles inherently less
reliable. It causes the vehicles to
experience non-trivial adverse behaviours
when exposed to a pattern of driving that is accepted to be part of the normal
and use of the vehicle (namely, the High Speed Driving Pattern).
Logically, such vehicles were worth less, at the time of supply,
otherwise would have been worth if they were not defective. Put differently,
given a choice between two otherwise identical
vehicles, one having the defect
and the other not having the defect, the only rational conclusion is that a
consumer would be willing
to pay less for the vehicle that has the defect than
the vehicle that does not have the defect. Every expert witness that gave
at trial ultimately accepted this blindingly obvious proposition, one
way or another.
332 For completeness, I should address TMCA’s contentions with respect
to secondary market data. It will be recalled that TMCA’s
response to the
reduction in value case centres on the proposition that the best source of
evidence for reduction in value is market
transactions, which it asserts show
that Relevant Vehicles held their value in the resale market better than
comparator vehicles.
It is said that this is inconsistent with any reduction in
value resulting from the Core Defect and also means that had group members
selected an alternative comparator vehicle instead, they would have been worse
333 I have dealt with the incompleteness of the market data relied upon by
TMCA to indicate that the market was fully informed about
the Core Defect and
Defect Consequences above: see [
]. While this is a determinative
reason to place no weight on the market data, three further points should be
, even if the market was informed
of the Core Defect at some point during the Relevant Period, the fact that
Relevant Vehicles had
a better relative resale value than comparator vehicles is
insufficient to indicate that there was no reduction in value. That is,
the data may indicate that Relevant Vehicles held their resale value better than
comparator vehicles, it does not necessarily
mean that the defect had no impact
on value. Mr Stockton gave evidence, which I accept, that in assessing market
data it is preferable
to identify a “break point” between periods in
which the market had differing levels of information about the defect
conclusions can be drawn concerning reduction in value, so that resale
performance due to differing levels of information
can be compared:
T213.29–31; First Stockton Report (at [264]). But in this case, there was
no such break point in the data:
T212.32–213.3; First Stockton Report (at
[260(a)]). While Dr Pleatsikas asserted that “the real world is
and there is not always a single breakpoint (T310.29–32) he
did not deny the importance to the analysis of identifying a break
comparing periods with differing levels of information: T312.37–313.29.
335 Identifying a break point is preferable because there are many
confounding factors in secondary market data that would need to
before the impact of a defect on market prices could be safely detected:
T267.17–25. As Mr Stockton stated, there
are “other factors that are
going on in the market, and other trends that are clearly unrelated to the
defect”, which
means little conclusion can be drawn from the mere fact
that Relevant Vehicles had better relative resale performance: T270.33–36.
In saying this, I should say that I accept, as Dr Pleatsikas opines, that
“the market is messy”, but where there is no
indication of when the
market became informed of the defect, and there are otherwise a multitude of
variables at play, it simply
cannot be said that the market data is probative
evidence of there being no reduction in value.
, even if the market had become increasingly informed of
issues that related in one way or another to the defect, Mr Stockton’s
initial regression analyses did not test whether sales prices later in the
period differed from sales prices earlier in the period.
This means it cannot be
inferred from the market data that such information as there was in the market
relating to the Core Defect
and its consequences had no impact on value.
, when it comes to determining whether there was a
reduction in value in Relevant Vehicles resulting from the Core Defect, the fact
that Relevant Vehicles held their value better than comparator vehicles in the
resale market is of little moment for at least two
further reasons: (1) it is
not a comparison that is directed to the new car market, so any potential
relevance would be confined
to the analysis of the supply of second-hand
vehicles to some group members; and (2) the relevant question for analysing loss
s 272(1)(a) is not a comparison between the position the purchaser is
in and the position the purchaser would be in if they had purchased
a different
actually purchased and the lesser of the
price paid or the average retail price
of those goods.
E.2.3 Quantifying the reduction in value
338 The real issue in
dispute concerns the
quantification
of the reduction in value. The
applicants contend that the presence of the Core Defect reduced the value of
each Relevant Vehicle
at the time it was supplied (as new) by an amount equal to
25 per cent of the average retail price of the Relevant Vehicle. That
real value of each of the Relevant Vehicles was 75 per cent of the average
retail price for that model at the time of purchase.
339 In embarking on the valuation task, it is important to keep in mind the
remarks of Viscount Simon LC in
Gold Coast Selection Trust Limited v Humphrey
(Inspector of Taxes)
[1948] AC 459
(at 473) that:
Valuation is an art, not an exact science. Mathematical certainty is not
demanded, nor indeed is it possible.
340 Nor would one expect there to be a single precise answer, in
circumstances where the question is one of valuation about a hypothetical
scenario at a point in the past:
River Bank Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of
(1974) 4 ALR 651
(at 653 per Stephen J);
Verge v Devere
Holdings Pty Ltd (No 4)
[2010] FCA 653
(at [221] per McKerracher J). See
Tomonovic v One Australia Pty Ltd
[2015] NSWCA 11
(2015) 104 ACSR
(at 626 [188] per Bathurst CJ, with whom Barrett JA agreed at 630 [220], and
Emmett JJA agreed at 632 [228]).
341 Ultimately, valuation is an exercise in estimation, informed by the
Court’s findings about the nature of the Core Defect
and the Defect
Consequences, and the Court’s characterisation of the severity of those
matters, judged through the eyes of
the hypothetical reasonable purchaser.
342 Indeed, in
Commonwealth v Milledge
[1953] HCA 6
(1953) 90 CLR 157
, Dixon CJ and
Kitto J described valuation of property in these terms (at 162):
It was indeed a jury question in the sense that it was to be decided, not by a
strict adherence to precise arithmetical calculations,
but by a commonsense
endeavour, after consideration of all the material before the court, to fix a
sum satisfactory to the mind of
the court as representing the value contained in
the land ...
six valuers gave evidence, and the trial judge formed
the view that, in Dixon CJ and Kitto J’s words, all were “men of
experience and integrity, and he drew no distinction amongst them in regard to
soundness of judgment or otherwise”. Faced with
such evidence, the task of
the trial judge was to make a “critical selection of the most helpful
facts from the mass of information
provided by the evidence, and applying
correct principles in the light of the selected material”. It was not to
simply calculate
the average of the six valuation opinions. Dixon CJ and Kitto J
held that the trial judge was required to “form an estimate
which really
satisfied his Honour’s mind as being the value of the property”: see
(at 160–162).
344 In much the same way, the expert evidence in this case provides the Court
with evidentiary guidance as to the appropriate quantum
of the reduction in
value resulting from the Core Defect. At a broad level, expressing the reduction
in value as a percentage of
the average retail price of the Relevant Vehicles
(with an eye to the relevant statutory exercise of ascertaining what the real
of the goods was at the time of purchase), the applicants’ experts
proffer the following views:
(1) Mr Cuthbert’s valuation evidence indicates that the reduction in value
resulting from the Core Defect, measured by reference
to Mr Cuthbert’s
expert opinion as to the value of the Relevant Prado at the time of supply, is
in the range of 23 per cent
to 27.5 per cent;
(2) Mr Boedeker’s survey evidence indicates that, on average, the
reduction in value resulting from the Core Defect, as measured
by the change in
consumers’ WTP for a defective vehicle compared to an identical,
non-defective vehicle, is above 10 per cent
but below 40 per cent, and most
likely in the range of approximately 20 per cent to 30 per cent; and
(3) Mr Stockton’s evidence indicates that the “minimum”
reduction in value resulting from the Core Defect, as measured
by reference to
the cost of repairing it, is in the range of approximately 2.9 per cent to 7.3
per cent. This is an inherently conservative
345 Given the extraordinary amount of time dedicated to the expert evidence
both at the hearing and in the parties’ submissions,
in particular the
criticisms levelled by TMCA towards the applicants’ experts, it is
necessary to address their evidence in
some depth. I will do so by reference to
the experts’ fields of expertise.
The valuation evidence
applicants’ valuer, Mr Cuthbert, was asked to value the Relevant Prado at
the time of supply on the following assumptions
(1) that the DPF System was not designed to function properly;
(2) that the DPF System was unable to regenerate effectively to prevent the DPF
from becoming full in all reasonably expected conditions;
(3) that if the Relevant Vehicle was exposed to the High Speed Driving Pattern,
it would experience one or more of the emission of
excessive white smoke with
foul odour, excessive warning notices, unscheduled servicing and malfunctioning
components.
347 In his first report, Mr Cuthbert opined that the defective DPF System in
the Relevant Prado was a “serious mechanical problem”
and that the
Defect Consequences were “serious”: First Cuthbert Report (at [101],
[103]). In his opinion, these features
materially reduced the value of the
Relevant Prado at the date of supply, and significantly so in circumstances
where there was no
effective fix available at that time: First Cuthbert Report
(at [103]–[104]). Other factors that reinforced this view were
that the vehicle was at risk of requiring additional servicing which would cause
inconvenience, and the owner was at risk
of embarrassment due to excessive white
smoke: First Cuthbert Report (at [105]–[107]). Although it was put to Mr
Cuthbert that
the Core Defect did not prevent the vehicle from being driven from
“point A to B” – an observation which he agreed
was accurate
in “[m]ost cases” – his view that the defect was
“serious” was not challenged: T113.6–26.
Indeed, Mr Cuthbert
considered that a vehicle is not necessarily fit for purpose merely because it
can “get people from A to
B”: T128.45–129.1.
348 In Mr Cuthbert’s view, at the time of supply (in April 2016) the
Relevant Prado was subject to a reduction in value of approximately
cent to 27 per cent: First Cuthbert Report (at [124]). There were three key
steps to Mr Cuthbert’s reasoning:
(1) Mr Cuthbert considered the seriousness of the Core Defect having regard to
his usual methodology for doing so, including looking
to factors such as: (a)
the impact of the Core Defect on the vehicle’s performance and operation;
(b) the need for the vehicle
to have additional service or repairs; (c) the
increased costs of owning the vehicle; (d) the reduced resale value of the
(e) the negative impact of the owner’s experience and enjoyment
of the vehicle; and (f) the reduced desirability of the vehicle:
First Cuthbert
Report (at [75]–[85], [99]–[108]).
(2) Mr Cuthbert had regard to the salvage value of the vehicle (which would have
been approximately 37–40 per cent less than
the new vehicle price) as a
floor price (that is, a price discount that was the absolute maximum): First
Cuthbert Report (at [114]–[116]);
(3) Mr Cuthbert had regard to the possibility that there may have existed
purchasers who would have purchased the Relevant Prado
in the hope that they
could find someone to fix the Core Defect: First Cuthbert Report (at [123]).
That involved a recognition that
such a person would be prepared to pay more
than the salvage price, but less than the market price for a non-defective
vehicle. As
to working out the right point between those two bookends, based on
his experience, Mr Cuthbert considered that such a purchaser
would have paid
approximately 23.5 to 27 per cent less than the new vehicle price: First
Cuthbert Report (at [124]).
349 Mr Cuthbert’s view also did not change when the Court asked him to
value the Relevant Prado at the time of supply using
information available
today. The fact that an effective repair would become available in July 2020 was
insufficient to gainsay the
reduction in value at the time of supply, when in
the meantime there would be inconvenience caused by additional servicing and
embarrassment
caused by excessive white smoke.
350 The initial position of TMCA’s valuer,
Mr O’Mara, was antithetical to that of Mr Cuthbert. In his report, Mr
concluded there was no quantifiable reduction in value of the
Relevant Prado resulting from the Core Defect at the time of supply:
O’Mara Report (at [89]). This was predicated on an analysis of the resale
history of five “comparable” Prados and
supported by his view that
the Core Defect and Defect Consequences were not that serious when regard was
had to the American Society
for Quality’s definition of a
“defect” and the GraysOnline Risk Calculator: O’Mara Report
(at [68]–[69],
[78]–[82]).
351 However, Mr
O’Mara somewhat retreated from this position during his oral evidence:
T180.8–12, 24–25; T181.10–18;
T182.42–183.4. As to the resale data, Mr O’Mara accepted that he
could not draw any conclusions from
the data concerning the five Prados without
making allowances for other attributes that might have changed and affected
prices, and
acknowledged that he had not engaged in this analysis:
T178.43–179.1. Indeed, Mr O’Mara ultimately appeared to accept
he could not draw anything from the resale data at all, or that any inference
was neutral: T179.3–11. Further, Mr O’Mara
relied on the GraysOnline
Risk Calculator to downplay the significance of the Core Defect, but accepted
that this was a tool used
to measure the risk to personal safety:
T180.8–25. Mr O’Mara accepted that negative attributes of a car that
affect personal safety, but would adversely affect value, would not
register on the GraysOnline Risk Calculator: T181.10–18.
cross-examination revealed that Mr O’Mara had used the GraysOnline Risk
Calculator and the American Society for Quality’s
definition of a
“defect” because he could not find any other appropriate benchmark:
T180.23–25; T182.7–9.
His ultimate position was that he assumed the
Core Defect does result in a reduction in value, albeit one which he did not
himself suitably equipped to quantify without a benchmark:
T182.42–183.4.
352 It is now necessary
to address the criticisms mounted by TMCA against Mr Cuthbert.
, it is said that Mr Cuthbert did not apply his own
methodology. TMCA points to the fact that Mr Cuthbert described a reasoning
whereby in order to value a defect, he would take into account the
factors outlined above (at [345(1)]) but the only thing that Mr
Cuthbert did was
to calculate the “salvage value” of the vehicle and then work up
from that value in some unspecified
way to identify an amount that a purchaser
would have been willing to pay: First Cuthbert Report (at [123]). It is said
this approach
is flawed because it relies upon an assumption that the
hypothetical purchaser would require the vehicle to be fixed prior to purchase
(from its salvage contents), skewing the exercise towards the bottom end of his
range of values (that is, a greater reduction).
354 Mr Cuthbert denied any suggestion he did not apply his own methodology,
observing that “[e]ach process, as it moves through
the report, is heading
towards establishing the value”: T127.19–20. I accept this evidence,
in part, because it accords
with Mr Cuthbert’s first report. The
seriousness of the mechanical problem, the lack of a fix at the time of supply,
of additional servicing and associated inconvenience, the embarrassment
and discomfort associated with excessive foul-smelling white
smoke and the
impact on resale value and desirability were all factors considered by Mr
Cuthbert: First Cuthbert Report (at [99]–[108]).
I similarly accept his
evidence that he did not start from salvage value and work up in a way that
skews the value to the bottom
end of the range: T126.3–T127.20. Instead,
as he explained, he merely used salvage value as a floor price to bookend the
T126.8–10; First Cuthbert Report (at [114], [121]). In
circumstances where no other objective benchmark existed, and the valuation
was hypothetical, it seems logical to have identified a yardstick below which
the value could not fall. In any event, it was
simply a price point to which Mr
Cuthbert considered it “appropriate to have regard”: First Cuthbert
Report (at [114]).
, it is said there are inadequacies in the First Cuthbert
Report because Mr Cuthbert did not take into account information from later
periods in his valuation (including secondary market data), and accounted for
inconvenience and embarrassment suffered by Mr Williams:
T114.8–17. But
these contentions go nowhere. They address issues of principle which I have
considered and determined above:
356 Ultimately, there is no reason not to accept Mr Cuthbert’s opinion
as a useful guide to valuation. Mr Cuthbert is a professional
car valuer with 50
years’ experience, and more importantly, his opinion accords with what I
consider to be robust common sense.
Valuation evidence cannot support reduction in value for group
more important question is whether Mr Cuthbert’s evidence can be used as a
means to quantify the reduction in value
in respect of the Relevant Vehicles
collectively.
358 The applicants’ position is that Mr Cuthbert’s evidence is
relevant generally to the question of quantification. On
the other hand, TMCA
submits that Mr Cuthbert was asked to value the Relevant Prado only, and
therefore cannot be said to be expressing
any wider view. There are two facets
to this submission:
, central to Mr Cuthbert’s valuation of
the Relevant Prado is the proposition that Mr Williams suffered inconvenience
and embarrassment
(T196.34–36) which is an inherently subjective factor
(T195.35–196.4); and
, applying Mr Cuthbert’s
conclusions generally would be misguided given there are differences between
different models of Relevant
359 I accept that Mr Cuthbert’s evidence is directed to the valuation
of the Relevant Prado and that there are differences between
different models
among the Relevant Vehicles. But I do not think this means Mr Cuthbert’s
evidence is irrelevant to the more
general question of quantifying the reduction
in value of the Relevant Vehicles. Mr Cuthbert valued the Relevant Prado based
Core Defect and the propensity for the Relevant Prado to exhibit Defect
Consequences which were
to all Relevant Vehicles, and expressed
his views at a level of generality applicable to all Relevant Vehicles:
T108.17–22;
T132.39–45. For example, in respect of the topic of
inconvenience and embarrassment, Mr Cuthbert was not focussed on the subjective
state of mind of Mr Williams, but on the objective inconvenience and
embarrassment, which he opined would affect owners of Relevant
generally: see, for example, First Cuthbert Report (at [75(c)]). Of course, his
opinion on reduction in value should not
be taken as a figure to be applied
carte blanche
, but that is not how it is sought to be used. I agree with
the applicants’ submission that Mr Cuthbert’s evidence can
a helpful indication of the likely reduction in value to be applied
The conjoint analysis
360 As I foreshadowed
above (at [
]), Mr Boedeker’s calculation of
the reduction in value is premised on a “choice-based conjoint
survey” which Mr
Boedeker designed. Dr Rossi’s evidence was
responsive to Mr Boedeker’s evidence.
361 A choice-based conjoint analysis, according to Mr Boedeker, is a form of
conjoint analysis in which survey participants are asked
to make choices between
various sets of product profiles, referred to as “choice sets”:
First Boedeker Report (at [24]–[25]).
It involves two stages. The
stage involves data collection through the conduct of a survey of
an appropriate sample of the relevant target population, where
participants are
presented with the choice sets (which are screens containing different products
with different attributes) and are
asked to select their preferred product:
First Boedeker Report (at [26]–[27], [126]–[127]). The
stage involves data analysis. The data collected through the survey is subjected
to various econometric and statistical techniques,
in order to draw
statistically valid inferences about how much more or less consumers would be
willing to pay for a specific product
if some particular attributes of the
product were to be varied: First Boedeker Report (at [28], [128]). The integers
of that survey,
the selection of survey participants and the survey methodology
are considered to translate survey participants’ answers into
is said to reflect a “reduction in value” of the product: First
Boedeker Report (at [29]).
362 While there was one survey, the choice screens shown to some participants
included the six attributes, while others only included
five: T354.10. The
common five attributes were: (a) model; (b) presence of the Core Defect; (c)
probability of manifestation of Defect
Consequences; (d) time taken until fix
for the defect is available; and (e) price: First Boedeker Report (at [233]).
The added attribute
was “defect effect on fuel consumption”. In the
six attribute survey, participants were shown a screen containing five
with different attributes and asked to choose their preferred vehicle from the
five. Survey participants completed this
task 15 times and each time the
attributes of the vehicles were varied: First Boedeker Report (at [238]).
363 An example of a screen of a five attribute choice set is set out below
(the top part of the choice set provides general information
the left-most column presents the features or “attributes” of the
vehicles; and the following five
columns then present the participants with
different “product profiles”, being vehicles with varying
of certain “attributes”, at different prices):
First Boedeker Report (at [207]).
364 As is discernible from the example above, the choice-based conjoint
survey posited scenarios where consumers had different levels
of awareness about
the probability that any one or more of the Defect Consequences would manifest
(namely 10 per cent, 25 per cent,
50 per cent or 60 per cent) and where
consumers also had different levels of awareness as to the availability of a fix
for the Core
Defect. The survey also posited different levels of excess fuel
consumption resulting from the Core Defect, namely not increased
‘0 per cent’), or increased by 3 per cent, 7 per cent or 10 per
cent. Mr Boedeker used the conjoint survey
results to calculate the impact of
the Core Defect on the marginal consumer’s WTP, and to ultimately arrive
at aggregate reduction
in value amounts for each model line (that is, Fortuner,
Prado, HiLux 4x2, and HiLux 4x4), and reduction in value percentages for
model line.
365 The Second Referee’s Report was received after Mr Boedeker had
completed his first report. In the Second Referee’s
Report, the referee
concluded that the Core Defect and/or Defect Consequences increased the fuel
consumption of Relevant Vehicles
]), and that the increase in average
fuel consumption for each of the vehicles in the TFCS was between 0 per cent and
9 per cent (with
the simple average of the mean fuel consumption increase of
these vehicles being 3 per cent): Second Referee’s Report (at [27]).
referee concluded that he could not determine a reliable single estimate of the
amount by which the Core Defect caused fuel consumption
to increase in all
Relevant Vehicles: Second Referee’s Report (at [30]).
366 Mr Boedeker considered the implications of the Second Referee’s
Report in his second report, and expressed the opinion that
participants been informed that the increase in fuel consumption was unknowable
but likely in the range of 0 per cent
and 9 per cent, their aggregate
preferences would generally have reflected an expected value towards the
midpoint of that range:
Second Boedeker Report (at [38]). Indeed, he considered
the reduction in value indicated by the results of the conjoint survey based
an increase in fuel consumption between 0 per cent or 3 per cent is likely to be
more conservative than would have been the case
if those participants were told
that the increase in fuel consumption was unknowable but likely in the range of
0 per cent and 9
per cent, as the centre of the range, 4.5 per cent, is larger
than either of these values: Second Boedeker Report (at [39]).
367 Nevertheless, in the light of the conclusions in the Second
Referee’s Report, Mr Boedeker considered that the most appropriate
scenario for assessing reduction in value was the combination of his 3 per cent
excess fuel and no available fix at the time of acquisition
permutations: Second
Boedeker Report (at [39], [43]–[44]). He summarised his findings as to
reduction in value as follows (Second
Boedeker Report (at [44(a)])):
368 The results range between 11.13 per cent and 39.59 per cent reduction in
value, according to the changing assumptions as to the
probability of the Defect
Consequences manifesting.
369 Mr Boedeker also detailed what he described as the “most
conservative estimate” of the reduction in value of the Relevant
(that is, where there was no increase in fuel consumption and no fix available
at the time of purchase). Mr Boedeker considered
“these estimates to
reflect the ‘minimum’ reduction in value resulting from the Defect
and risk of Defect Consequences”:
Second Boedeker Report (at [46]). His
findings in this respect were as follows: Second Boedeker Report (at
370 The general and intuitive trend indicated by these results is that as the
manifestation probability increases, so too does the
reduction in WTP.
371 The results of the survey indicate that the reduction in consumers’
WTP for defective vehicles is, generally speaking, above
10 per cent but below
40 per cent, and, according to Mr Boedeker, most likely in the range of
approximately 20–30 per cent.
372 The real issue between Mr Boedeker and Dr Rossi is whether the results of
the survey are so unreliable as to be of no utility
at all. TMCA advances no
less than 18 separate criticisms of Mr Boedeker’s report, largely relying
on the evidence of Dr Rossi.
Broadly speaking, these are criticisms directed at
three levels: (1) at the level of principle; (2) at the level of survey design;
and (3) at the level of survey execution and results interpretation.
373 I have already dealt with the criticisms advanced at the level of
principle above: see [
]. It would be surplusage to repeat the
entire suite of criticisms directed at the survey design, execution and
interpretation. It
suffices to canvass the core criticisms with a degree of
amalgamation and synthesis:
(1) It is said that
there were various
categories of survey responses which indicated that many survey participants did
not take the survey seriously
or did not understand what the survey was about.
This is because the results included a number of “gibberish”
to the open-ended questions in Mr Boedeker’s survey,
including random and nonsensical sequences of characters such as
and “34t45y656ygbh”: T393.31,
T394.27–28, T395.1; Rossi Report (at [142]). Apart from these answers, the
are examples of answers given by participants to open ended questions
said to indicate the survey was not being taken seriously (Rossi
[139], [141])):
(a) “Plz give me extra. Money than usual i need to feed kids”;
(b) “It’s perfect, it’s nutritious, it’s rich, and
it’s done very quickly”; and
(c) “I’m pretty keen for data entry jobs if you are aware of any
please email me”.
(2) TMCA submits that there is evidence of “speeding” by survey
participants, that is, participants did not read carefully
the instructions and
attribute descriptions: Rossi Report (at [122]–[130]). Mr Boedeker
accepted that it was essential for
participants to read the instructions and
definitions carefully (T396.36–41; T399.18–23) but conceded he had
any views about the amount of time it should take for participants to
do so: T398.21–37. Further, participants were not told
should spend reading the instructions in each screen, nor was any strategy
implemented to ensure a participant
remained on a question for a set period:
T398.46–47. Dr Rossi observed that 76.6 per cent of Analysed Responses
than 60 seconds on the instructions and 35 per cent spent less
than six seconds per question: Rossi Report (at [123]–[127]).
this was an inadequate amount of time to process all of the information on each
choice screen in order to consider the
trade-offs between the five options
presented. The only possible inference, in Dr Rossi’s opinion, is these
did not take the survey seriously or the survey design
was too cognitively taxing: Rossi Report (at [125], [128]).
(3) TMCA submits that 99.7 per cent of the Analysed
Responses exhibited illogical preferences for more severe defects at a
significant level (Rossi Report at [149]–[150];
T330.25–37), to an extent which Dr Rossi had not seen in his 20
experience: Boedeker and Rossi Report (at p 4 of Dr Rossi’s
statement). It is said that if the survey participants had understood
instructions, then the results would reflect the logic that a less severe defect
should be preferred over a more severe
defect: Rossi Report (at
[147]–[149], [151]); Boedeker and Rossi Report (at p 4 of Dr Rossi’s
statement). Further, TMCA
contends that there is an illogical disparity between
the results of Mr Boedeker’s five attribute survey (without fuel
consumption
as an attribute) and six attribute survey (with fuel consumption as
an attribute). Given both address a situation where there is
no excess fuel
consumption (that is, a 0 per cent option), it is said that their results should
be the same yet they are not: the
five attribute estimates were larger than the
corresponding 0 per cent increase in fuel consumption results from the six
survey: Rossi Report (at Exhibit 9; [82]). These results, it is said,
imply that consumers would be willing to pay more for a vehicle
“Defect” that increases fuel consumption than they would for a
vehicle with an otherwise identical defect which
does not affect fuel
consumption: Rossi Report (at [82]).
374 Other criticisms of Mr Boedeker’s survey include: (a) the price
elasticities of demand revealed by the survey indicate it
was biased and
confusing; (b) there is evidence of survey fraud; (c) the survey did not reflect
real-world decision-making; and (d)
there was a failure to conduct a proper
“pre-test”: see Rossi Report (at [92]–[95]; [131]–[138];
[158]–[166]).
375 The applicants’ main response to these contentions is that Dr Rossi
failed to take a constructive approach to the process
of designing an effective
survey instrument, consistent with his obligations under the Court’s
Survey Evidence Practice Note
(GPN-SURV) (
Practice Note
), and that
many criticisms raised by Dr Rossi should have been raised in TMCA’s
responses to the survey while it was being
drafted, but they were not. Nor were
these issues raised, it is said, in a subsequent meeting between Mr Boedeker and
Dr Rossi for
the purpose of conferring upon any outstanding issues or concerns
held by Dr Rossi in relation to the design of the survey. The applicants’
submit that because of Dr Rossi’s failure to engage constructively with Mr
Boedeker in the process of designing the survey,
the Court should, consistently
with the Practice Note, attach little weight to his subsequent criticisms of the
design of the survey.
376 The applicants’ contentions may have some merit, but that does not
mean the survey should be accepted uncritically. The
fact is, as TMCA submits,
there were a number of difficulties with the survey, which throw doubt on the
validity of a number of responses,
and should influence the weight to be
attributed to it. In saying this, at times, TMCA exaggerates these difficulties:
for example,
Mr Boedeker accepted that the five attribute survey produced
anomalies and instead sought to focus on those results identified in
attribute version of his survey: Second Boedeker Report (at [79]). Similarly, as
will be seen, the emphasis on illogicality
of responses is overstated.
377 Nevertheless, the applicants do not contend that the survey ought to be
the source of truth for a precise reduction in value.
It is the general picture
that emerges from the conjoint analysis which it is said, and I accept, is still
some limited utility in coming to a landing on a
figure for any reduction in value.
378 The results of Mr Boedeker’s survey, at a very broad level, make
intuitive sense: wholly unsurprisingly, they suggest consumers
are willing to
pay less for defective vehicles than they are willing to pay for identical,
non-defective vehicles, and the difference
in WTP widens as the probability of
manifestation of the Defect Consequences and the duration of the Core Defect
increases. This
overarching trend is reflected by the “heat maps”
prepared by Mr Boedeker: Second Boedeker Report (at [89]). The “heat
map” for the Prado, for example, is as follows:
379 In summary, while it is no doubt true that Mr
Boedeker’s survey confronted difficulties, I accept his conjoint survey
is a very general indicator of a significant reduction in value of the
Relevant Vehicles resulting from the Core Defect. Given Dr
criticisms and my reservations as to the accuracy of the survey (and having
regard to the principles of law that apply
in relation to the valuation
exercise), it is unrealistic (and unnecessary) to seek to attach any greater
reliance or precision to
Mr Boedeker’s survey than this general
impressionistic finding.
The economic evidence
380 Although
the applicants do not advance Mr Stockton’s repair cost model analysis as
their primary submission, it is said
that such evidence nonetheless assists to
“define the floor” for the reduction in value percentage of between
7.3 per cent of average retail price.
381 It is unnecessary to detail Mr Stockton’s “Repair Cost
Model” with granularity: see First Stockton Report (at
[164]–[217]).
Mr Stockton defines it as follows (at [164]):
The Repair Cost Model evaluates the Reduction in Value experienced by Group
Members who received defective vehicles instead of the
non-defective vehicles
for which they bargained. The Repair Cost Model applies accepted economic theory
and relevant market data
to determine the amount of compensation that would have
restored Group Members to positions equivalent to those they would have occupied
had the Affected Vehicles been non-defective at the point of sale. Specifically,
the Repair Cost Model calculates the amount of money
that would need to be paid
to consumers in order for the combination of compensation and their receipt of
Affected Vehicles as delivered
to place them in an equally good position as that
which they would have occupied had the Affected Vehicles been non-defective.
(Citation omitted).
382 Essentially, the explanation for Mr Stockton’s Repair Cost Model as
a method for measuring reduction in value is that the
cost of a remedial repair
is a market-based transaction that conceptually reflects a proper and reasonably
accurate estimate of the
reduction in value associated with the Core Defect,
because had it been delivered at the point of acquisition, it would have
the consumer to the expected level of utility they bargained for at
that time: First Stockton Report (at [187]).
383 Mr Stockton’s model uses the warranty repair cost that TMCA
reimbursed to dealers for performing the 2020 Field Fix (that
is, the average
amount that TMCA has spent on DPF repairs in respect of the Relevant Vehicles)
as a proxy for the amount of money
that would have been required, at the time of
purchase, to restore group members to the position they would have been in had
not been any non-compliance with the statutory guarantee. This figure is
calculated using the warranty service histories, the data
source of which is
from TMCA’s records and is known, and referred to as the
WINPAQ Data
(WINPAQ being
a custom built financial system used to monitor, track
and process reimbursement claims submitted by dealers): AF [18]; First Stockton
Report (at [61]). This calculation, it is said, provides a conservative proxy
for the impact of the Core Defect on the expected utility
of the Relevant
Vehicle to consumers, and hence a measure of reduced value. The reason it is
said to be conservative, or “constitutes
a floor”, is because
although it measures the economic value of restoring the consumer to the
position they ought to have been
in at the time of supply, it does not account
for the fact that the 2020 Field Fix was not delivered for many years: First
Report (at [447]).
384 The quantification of the repair cost by vehicle model, and the aggregate
reduction in value, is described in detail by Mr Stockton:
First Stockton Report
(at [206]–[217]). In effect, to derive the average cost of the repair for
each vehicle model, Mr Stockton
divides the total costs paid by TMCA to Toyota
dealers in respect of the 2020 Field Fix warranty repairs delivered by those
by the number of vehicles that received the service: First Stockton
Report (at [212]). Mr Stockton then converts these figures from
dollars in 2020
to the relative prices in the relevant earlier build year for that vehicle
model: First Stockton Report (at [213]).
385 In addition to the criticisms mounted by TMCA against the evidence of Mr
Stockton at a level of principle and in respect of the
market data, which I have
addressed above (see [
]), it is said that a number of issues
plague Mr Stockton’s evidence and methodology. I will address each of them
, TMCA submits, relying on the Report of Dr Pleatsikas, that
it is untenable to treat the amount that a manufacturer is prepared to
warranty as a proxy for reduction in value. The amount that a manufacturer may
be willing to pay does not necessarily relate
to the specific effect that such
repairs may have on the marketplace values of the particular vehicles: Stockton
and Pleatsikas Joint
Report (at [23]). The cost of executing warranty repairs,
it is said, may in some circumstances exceed the value of economic harm
members: Pleatsikas Report (at [117]).
387 While there may be different methods for calculating reduction in value,
using the amount a manufacturer paid under warranty is
“untenable”. Indeed, the amounts used from the WINPAQ data are the
amounts TMCA reimbursed to dealerships for
the execution of warranty repairs;
they are not the total cost to the manufacturer of executing a warranty
campaign. There is also
no suggestion the 2020 Countermeasures were enhancing,
rather than remedial: Second Stockton Report (at [53]).
it is said that any attempt to rely on Mr
Stockton’s analysis also suffers from the inherent logical problem that
the cost of repairs. If recovery on the basis of repair costs was
awarded by the Court, it is said group members who have had repairs
will have received the full benefit of the value of those repairs and
will be paid the cost of those repairs. The problem is compounded, it is
said, if a group member sold the vehicle, as the new owner
would also be a group
389 The mere fact that TMCA pays for the repair (that is, the 2020 Field Fix)
does not explain why the cost of that repair would not
be a reasonable
approximation for the reduction in value suffered. In substance, this assertion
seems more directed to the issue
of whether or not group members
a reduction in value loss.
390 In the end, while I accept that there are some imperfections with Mr
Stockton’s analysis, it is of some use.
Conclusions on quantifying the reduction in value
391 After trudging
manfully through the expert evidence, it is necessary to recall the basic
proposition I stated at the commencement
of the quantification analysis –
“valuation is an art, not an exact science”. There is no doubt that
the Core Defect
and the Defect Consequences were not merely trivial or trifling.
While the Core Defect did not directly interfere with the safety
of the Relevant
Vehicles, when the Defect Consequences manifested, which was a certainty
occasioned by the normal use of highway
driving, they were serious. On this
basis, the reduction in value of all of the Relevant Vehicles, which each had
the propensity
to suffer from the Defect Consequences, was far from
insignificant.
392 In landing on a figure as to the appropriate reduction in value, I have
given weight to the entirety of the expert evidence and
the submissions advanced
by the parties in respect of that evidence. This is not a case, as TMCA submits,
J.L.W. (Vic) Pty Ltd v Tsiloglou
[1994] VicRp 16
(1994) 1 VR 237
, where the Court
should decline to put a figure on the reduction in value because there is no
reliable indicator to inform such a
figure. It makes intuitive sense for the
figure to be above that calculated by Mr Stockton and, for the reasons reflected
evidence of Mr Boedeker and Mr Cuthbert, to be a significant figure. The
very nature of the Defect Consequences demands such a conclusion.
393 The applicants advocate for a reduction in value of 25 per cent. There is
always a difficulty in settling upon a pin-point figure
in cases of this type.
Doing so, although necessary, tends to lend a patina of precision to what in
truth is an evaluative and imprecise
exercise upon which, at least at the
margins, reasonable minds may differ. I am inclined, however, to consider the
figure fastened
upon by the applicants as being simply too high. My reasons for
this conclusion have been addressed in relation to my findings as
to the expert
evidence, which has led me to conclude that although the evidence of Mr Boedeker
and Mr Cuthbert has some force, a
number of the criticisms directed to its
accuracy and reliability also have merit. But the conclusion that a reduction in
still be a figure of significance not only aligns with common sense,
but more specifically, my perception of the evidence of Mr Williams
effect of the Defect Consequences more generally, as borne out by the customer
complaints (as to which see [
Doing the best I can, a reduction in value in the range of 15 per cent to 20 per
cent is appropriate having regard to all the
evidence. Given the need to land on
an exact figure, I should settle in the middle of this range, that is, a
reduction of 17.5 per
394 While, of course, the applicants bear the onus of establishing a
reduction in value and an appropriate quantification for that
reduction, I am
somewhat fortified in this view by reason of the fact that none of TMCA’s
experts provided any real analysis
of their own as to the reduction in value
that was suffered by group members. Although Mr O’Mara conceded that the
Core Defect
reduced the value of the Relevant Prado, he did not express any view
]. Likewise, TMCA’s expert
economists provided no positive evidence in relation to the quantification of
the reduction in value.
E.2.3 Applying the reduction in value
395 After determining
that the reduction in value for the Relevant Vehicles should be in the figure of
17.5 per cent, it is then necessary
to turn to the practicality of any award of
damages to reflect this reduction. Two issues arise at this stage of the
(1) determining the meaning of the concepts “price paid or payable”
and “average retail price” in s 272(1)(a)(i)–(ii)
and how they
apply in the current case; and
(2) determining whether there should be an award of aggregate damages for the
reduction in value.
396 I will deal with each of these issues, and the subsidiary issues they
throw up, in turn.
The meaning of “price paid or payable” and
“average retail price” in s 272(1)(a)(i)–(ii)
is necessary initially to return to an aspect of statutory construction. As
noted above, s 272(1)(a) of the ACL provides an
entitlement to damages for
any reduction in value of goods, resulting from a failure to comply with the
guarantee below the lower
of: (i) the price paid or payable by the consumer for
the goods; or (ii) the average retail price of the goods at the time of
of these concepts – the price paid or payable by
the consumer for the goods – is straightforward. The price paid for
goods is the purchase price exclusive of taxes such as GST, luxury car tax
) or stamp duty. This is because s 2(1) of the ACL defines the
“price” of goods as an amount paid or payable “for
acquisition”, whereas a tax is an amount paid to the Government by
reference to the acquisition price, not in exchange
of these concepts – the average retail price of
the goods at the time of supply – is more complex. It is not defined
the ACL and no guidance is otherwise provided as to its interpretation. Indeed,
the statute does not identify the time period
over which the average is to be
taken (apart from implicitly requiring that it be the average at the time of
supply), nor does it
identify whether the sales prices included in the average
must be for identical goods in every respect.
400 This lack of clarity must be resolved, because Relevant Vehicles from the
same model line (that is, Prado, HiLux, Fortuner) were
often sold at different
prices due to their different attributes, or because they were sold in a
different period.
Preliminary issues
preliminary issues arise for determination:
(1) Should the average retail price be calculated across a whole model line, or
should the average retail price be disaggregated,
such as by series and build
(2) Should the average retail price be exclusive or inclusive of accessories
that were added to the vehicle at the time of supply?
402 The relevant Explanatory Memorandum provides limited assistance in
resolving these issues. However, it does confirm that the legislative
of the “lower of” formula in s 272(1)(a) is to ensure that
manufacturers are “not required to provide
excessive compensation to
consumers if suppliers charge high prices for goods”: Explanatory
Memorandum,
Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill (No 2)
(at [7.122]). In the absence of contrary textual or contextual
indications, the meaning of “average retail price” should
determined consistently with this legislative intention.
403 In respect of the
question, the legislative intention weighs
in favour of averaging only across vehicles that are alike, to the extent that
practically measurable – that is, vehicles of the same series and
sold in the same time period. This is because averaging the
retail price across
all Relevant Vehicles over the Relevant Period in a particular model line would
tend to: (a) overstate the average
retail price for lower priced trim levels or
earlier produced vehicles, which could mask the extent to which suppliers
charged excessive
prices for those vehicles; and (b) understate the average
retail price on higher priced trim levels or vehicles produced at times
prices were higher. This could mean that some consumers receive no damages
simply because they purchased a vehicle with a higher
trim level, or at a time
when prices were higher, not because the supplier charged an excessive price for
the vehicle supplied. Both
of these results would be contrary to the legislative
intention of the “lower of” formula in s 272(1)(a).
404 In respect of the
question, the applicants contend that the
legislative intention militates in favour of measuring the purchase price of
average retail price of those goods
of accessories,
whereas TMCA appears to contend that the average retail price must include
accessories (albeit no reasoning is provided
for this contention). I favour the
applicant’s position because if average retail prices were calculated with
purchase prices
that included accessories, this would tend to increase the
average retail price and could mask the extent to which suppliers charged
excessive prices. Further, assuming reduction in value is to be calculated by
applying a percentage reduction to the average retail
price, the reduction in
value would be magnified if this percentage were applied to average retail
prices calculated using purchase
prices inclusive of accessories. This would be
contrary to the legislative intention, as it could result in excessive damages
because a consumer purchased expensive accessories.
The mechanics of calculating “average retail
to the mechanics of calculating the average retail price for each Relevant
Vehicle, the applicants contend, and I accept, that
it can be done as
406 The starting point for each Relevant Vehicle is the applicable MSRP for
that vehicle. The MSRP is TMCA’s recommended retail
price for the vehicle,
including GST and LCT but excluding accessories. The MSRPs within each model
line varied from vehicle to vehicle
by, among other things, time of production,
time of sale and series.
407 It is then necessary to consider the data showing actual sales. This is
drawn from the records of sales for Relevant Vehicles
sold as new by the top 29
dealers: AF [16]. This is the data that Mr Stockton used for the purpose of
calculating average purchase
prices for each model and build year of Relevant
Vehicles: First Stockton Report (at [63]–[70]). Mr Stockton
the data, including removing transactions where sales
prices exceeded MSRP because such transactions likely included substantial
expensive accessories, and if those transactions were included, it could
overstate any average purchase prices calculated: First
Stockton Report (at
[69]). Mr Stockton did not otherwise attempt to remove accessories costs from
the dealer sales price data, because
the relevant data does not record the
extent to which the recorded sales prices included accessories in any given
case. Mr Stockton
did, however, remove any GST or LCT from the dealer sales
prices before using them to calculate average purchase prices, so that
averages were calculated on a tax exclusive basis: First Stockton Report (at
408 Further, in order to control the level of variation in sales prices
across the Relevant Period (affecting each model line due
to varying series,
build year and time of supply), Mr Stockton calculated the average of Relevant
Vehicle sales prices as a percentage
of their applicable MSRP: First Stockton
Report (at [66]). This process yielded an average discount rate for each model
line of Relevant
Vehicles for each build year that controls for different MSRPs
that apply to different series within a model line. This discount
rate can then
be applied to the MSRP applicable to any particular Relevant Vehicle.
Calculating average retail prices in this manner
is consistent with the
legislative intention, as it ensures a “like for like” comparison.
409 Pausing here, it is convenient to address two apparent criticisms of TMCA
concerning this approach to average retail prices.
, TMCA appears to criticise Mr Stockton’s calculation
of average retail prices (calculated as a percentage of MSRP) on the basis
he used sales prices inclusive of accessories, for which it is said no evidence
has been adduced by the applicants. This criticism
should be rejected. Although
Mr Stockton used sales prices inclusive of accessories, he excluded transactions
where sales prices
exceeded MSRP. He did this so his calculations would not
overstate average retail prices, and to ensure a “reasonable and
calculation: First Stockton Report (at [69]). This evidence was
not challenged by TMCA or Dr Pleatsikas. It is unsatisfactory for
TMCA to now
assert that Mr Stockton’s average purchase prices (expressed as a
percentage of MSRP) fail to provide an appropriate
approximation for actual
average retail prices excluding accessories.
411 Indeed, and in any event, Mr Stockton’s conclusions are consistent
with other evidence. Mr Cuthbert’s evidence, for
example, was that the
standard discount off MSRP in 2016 was in the order of 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per
cent (First Cuthbert Report
(at [95])) indicating that Mr Stockton’s
calculation of a discount for the 2016 Prado of 3.77 per cent is reasonable.
TMCA did not adduce evidence indicating that Mr Stockton’s
calculations understate the standard discount off MSRP or average
retail prices
for Relevant Vehicles, nor is this a case where evidence of actual sales prices
excluding accessories was available.
Even after subpoenaing to the top 29
dealers, the data produced only provided final sales prices inclusive of
accessories. While
I accept that TMCA bears the onus, I am comfortably satisfied
that approximation using this data is reasonable in the circumstances:
Placer (Granny Smith)
Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd
; (2003) 196 ALR 257 (at 266 [38] per Hayne J with whom Gleeson CJ, McHugh
and Kirby JJ agreed at 259 [6]).
, TMCA appears to criticise the applicants’ average
retail prices because they were based only on a sample of sales prices,
whole population of 264,170 vehicles (that is, 107,775 of the Relevant Vehicles,
or 41 per cent of the total Relevant Vehicles).
This criticism should also be
rejected. The purpose of the exercise is to discern an average price. It was not
put to Mr Stockton
that the sample he used was inappropriately small, or that it
did not yield statistically significant averages. Further, while TMCA
that the top 29 dealers may have priced the vehicles differently from dealers
outside the data set, no evidence is provided
for this contention. Nor does TMCA
attempt to show by reference to any data that the sample used by Mr Stockton for
calculating average
sales prices did not generate statistically significant
413 In this respect, it is important to bear in mind the need for the
legislation to be given a practical operation. This is a class
action conducted
on behalf of a large number of group members and supported by sophisticated
representatives and a litigation funder.
In the ordinary course, s 272(1)(a)
would need to be applied for the purposes of an individual’s claim for
damages by reference
to the particular defective goods that they purchased. If
such a claimant could only prove the “average retail price”
goods by obtaining the sales data for every sale across the country in the
relevant period, the statutory entitlement to
damages could never be effectively
enforced. A methodology which establishes the average price based on a
reasonably indicative dataset
must be sufficient for the purposes of the
414 Further, to the extent necessary, comfort in this conclusion can be taken
from Mr Stockton’s “‘Lower of’
calculation, described below at [438
]. It appears those “Lower
of” discount figures were within 97 to 99 per cent of the average purchase
prices that Mr Stockton
calculated, which suggests there is little variation in
the data used. In other words, it can be inferred that the averages Mr Stockton
calculated are likely to have been materially accurate.
415 With questions as to construction and
calculation clarified, it is necessary to turn to the question of aggregate
Aggregate Damages
416 The power to award
damages on an aggregate basis is found in s 33Z of the Act, which,
relevantly, is in the following terms:
33Z Judgment
powers of Court
(1) The Court may, in determining a matter in a representative proceeding, do
any one or more of the following:
(e) make an award of damages for group members, sub‑group members or
individual group members, being damages consisting of
specified amounts or
amounts worked out in such manner as the Court specifies;
(f) award damages in an aggregate amount without specifying amounts awarded in
respect of individual group members;
(2) In making an order for an award of damages, the Court must make provision
for the payment or distribution of the money to the
group members entitled.
(3) Subject to section 33V, the Court is not to make an award of damages
under paragraph (1)(f) unless a reasonably accurate assessment
can be made
of the total amount to which group members will be entitled under the judgment.
417 As is evident from the statutory text, there are two ways in which a
Court can award damages on an aggregate basis: via s 33Z(1)(e)
or s 33Z(1)(f).
418 The Court’s power in s
33Z(1)(e) is not premised on any
condition being satisfied, other than the general requirement, stated in the
chapeau to s 33Z(1),
that the Court must be “determining a matter in a
representative proceeding”, which requirement is undoubtedly satisfied
here. However, it is limited to particular kinds of damages awards, namely an
award that prescribes how the quantum of damages for
group members, sub-group
members or individual members is to be ascertained, or an award that specifies
the amounts to which each
of them are entitled. By contrast, the Court’s
power in s 33Z(1)(f), to award damages in an aggregate sum without
amounts to be awarded in respect of individual group members, is
enlivened only when the condition set out in s 33Z(3) is met. That
damages in an aggregate amount can only be awarded if a “reasonably
accurate assessment can be made of the total amount
to which group members will
be entitled under the judgment”.
419 I should note that I have already determined, as a separate question
before the initial trial, the issue of whether the Court
s 33Z(1)(e) or s 33Z(1)(f), make an award for
of the damages
claimed by some or all group members in the proceeding. The answer is yes: see
Williams v Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Limited
[2021] FCA 1425
[69], [73], [76] per Lee J).
420 The applicants’ advance, as alternatives, both a s 33Z(1)(e) case
and a s 33Z(1)(f) case. Before turning to consider these
cases, it is convenient
to recall some basic principles applicable to the award of compensatory damages
and address a number of overarching
submissions levelled by TMCA against why the
claim for aggregate damages, whether based on s 33Z(1)(e) or (f), should not
General principles that govern the assessment of
421 Although sometimes
it might seem the case procedurally, class actions are not the litigation
equivalent of the Galapagos Islands
– the hinterland of the broader law of
damages must inform the analysis undertaken in addressing compensatory issues in
present context. Speaking at a general level, two overarching principles as
to the award of compensatory damages ought to be borne
, an award of compensatory damages
must be considered in the light of the overriding compensatory principle –
that damages should
be assessed so as to compensate the injured party for the
wrong done, with the object of such an award being to put the claimant
position the claimant would have been in but for the contravening conduct: see
Gates v City Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd
[2001] HCA 52
; (1986) 160
CLR 1 (at 13–14 per Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ). Indeed, as McHugh J
emphasised in
Henville v Walker
[2001] HCA 52
(2001) 206 CLR 459
[131]), any measure of damages must give way to the overriding principles of
fair and not excessive compensation.
, and as an extension of the
first point, it is trite that when it comes to assessing the amount of any
damages award, “mere
difficulty in estimating damages does not relieve a
court from the responsibility of estimating them” and “[w]here
evidence is not available the court must do the best it can”:
Commonwealth v Amann Aviation Pty Ltd
[1991] HCA 54
(1991) 174 CLR 64
(at 83 per Mason
CJ and Dawson J). This principle equally applies when assessing reduction in
value damages under s 272(1)(a): see
Overarching observations and findings
advances a number of submissions against the award of aggregate damages, which
are relevant to both the s 33Z(1)(e) and s
33Z(1)(f) cases. It is convenient to
address those criticisms here.
425 A number of TMCA’s submissions can be disposed of briefly. TMCA
submits that the number of group members being unknown,
that the number of
Relevant Vehicles that have received the 2020 Field Fix continues to increase,
and the fact that any claimed reduction
in value requires an assessment of the
individual Relevant Vehicle and the extent to which (if at all) the vehicle
suffered from
any of the Defect Consequences, means an award of aggregate
damages ought to be refused.
426 These contentions have no merit. To the extent it is said that this
aspect of the damages inquiry requires an assessment of the
which each vehicle suffered from any of the Defect Consequences, that submission
is misconceived. As I have repeated, the applicants’
representative case
is based on
, not experience. As to the issue of group
membership and the 2020 Field Fix, the aggregate reduction in value amount will
to be calculated upon TMCA providing updated information (current as at
the date of judgment) in respect of the number of Relevant
Vehicles which have
received the 2020 Field Fix and/or in respect of which refunds or replacement
vehicles have been provided through
TMCA’s consumer redress programme.
Relevant Vehicles acquired by group members who have opted out will also be able
to be excluded
from the calculation of aggregate reduction in value damages at
427 The more substantive contention put forward by TMCA relates to the effect
of different permutations of ownership of the Relevant
Vehicles. Put simply, two
integers are relevant to the assessment of damages – group members and
Relevant Vehicles. There is
no difficulty in calculating damages where a group
member has held a Relevant Vehicle for the entire Relevant Period, as the two
integers coincide (
Entire Period Group Members
). The situation is
complicated, however, where group members have bought and/or sold a Relevant
Vehicle on the secondary market,
as the two integers do not coincide (
Period Group Members
428 The applicants accept that an adjustment is necessary in the
circumstances of Partial Period Group Members, and skilfully seek
to skirt this
issue by proposing that the Court determine a single recoverable sum for the
reduction in value for each Relevant Vehicle,
which is then shared
proportionally between group members who held or hold an interest in that
vehicle and who come forward to claim
damages in the distribution scheme.
429 But this is problematic for a number of reasons. Assume Consumer A
purchased a Relevant Vehicle new and traded it into a dealer.
That Relevant
Vehicle was then purchased by Consumer B. How do Consumer A and Consumer B share
any damages award? Does the share
depend on how long each party held the
vehicle, or the number of kilometres they each travelled? What is the total life
of the vehicle
by reference to which the calculation takes place? Alternatively,
does the share depend on how much Consumer B paid Consumer A, perhaps
as a percentage of the new car price? Are relative prices relevant at all? Does
it matter that the 2020 Field Fix was some
time away for Consumer A, whereas it
was available for Consumer B? Each of these questions arise in this one simple
430 Take another: assume Consumer A purchased a Relevant Vehicle from a
trader but immediately thereafter got a job with a company
car and, just as
quickly, on-sold it to Consumer B by a private sale. The initial cost of the
sale was recovered by Consumer A from
Consumer B, save for a very minor amount
relating to stamp duty and the like. Although Consumer A suffered relevant loss
on purchase
by buying the Relevant Vehicle at greater than true value, he
recovered this loss entirely by passing it on to Consumer B. Although
applicants seek to address this problem by a single recoverable sum for the
reduction in value for each Relevant Vehicle, it
seems to me that fixing a sum
by reference to the sole measure of how long a group member held onto the car is
superficial. Ultimately
the best measure of loss when there has been a secondary
sale may depend upon other circumstances, and in the case of secondary sales,
approach this aspect of the damages claim as the applicants suggest could
conceivably, in individual cases, produce anomalous
431 Further and more complex permutations are easily imaginable and the
counterfactuals would cascade in complexity as the number
of owners of a
Relevant Vehicle increases. Apart from these examples, the question arises as to
what should occur if there are two
owners of a Relevant Vehicle, Consumer A and
Consumer B, but Consumer B never comes forward – is the effect of the
applicants’
proposal that Consumer A should recover the entire reduction
in value amount?
432 The bottom line is that without knowing the price at which, or the time
at which, the Partial Period Group Members bought and
sold Relevant Vehicles on
the secondary market, one cannot determine on a principled basis how the
compensation for the owners of
those Relevant Vehicles ought to be assessed or
distributed. One must always bear in mind the whole object of any award of
is to put the claimant in the position the claimant would have been in
but for the contravening conduct.
433 Therefore, while the simplicity of an “award damages and figure it
out later” approach is appealing, it does not seem
to me to be one that is
satisfactory.
434 In any event, the approach of awarding damages on a
per vehicle
and determining the question of distribution to group members at a
later stage is unsupported by the terms of s 33Z.
435 Importantly, s 33Z(1)(e) specifies that the Court can “make an
award of damages for
group members
sub‑group members
individual group members
” (emphasis added) and while s 33Z(1)(f)
allows the Court to “award damages in an aggregate amount without
amounts awarded in respect of individual group members”, s
33Z(3) states that such an order is not to be made “unless
a reasonably
accurate assessment can be made of the total amount to which
group members
will be entitled
under the judgment” (emphasis added). As is evident,
ss 33Z(1)(e) and (f) are concerned with assessing damages based on the
be distributed to
group members
(not some other measure, such as Relevant
436 Even if I am wrong in this respect, s 33Z(1) embodies a discretion:
“[t]he Court
, in determining a matter in a representative
proceeding, do any one or more of the following ...”: (emphasis added).
reasons I have outlined, I would, in any event, decline to make an award
of aggregate damages in respect of the Partial Period Group
Members. The award
of such damages must be made on an individualised basis, having regard to the
individual circumstances of the
Partial Period Group Members.
Entire Period Group Members
437 The question that
remains is whether damages should be awarded on an aggregate basis to the Entire
Period Group Members, and if
so, whether the appropriate mechanism to award such
damages is s 33Z(1)(e) or s 33Z(1)(f). I have concluded that s 33Z(1)(e) is the
appropriate head of power to award aggregate damages. Before explaining why this
is so, it is necessary to touch briefly on the s
33Z(1)(f) case.
438 In summary, the applicants submit that the Court can arrive at a
“reasonably accurate” aggregate damages amount as
the basis of an
award of damages under s 33Z(1)(f) for reduction in value by applying a
methodology with the following key integers:
(1) a reduction in value percentage of 17.5 per cent, meaning each of the
Relevant Vehicles should be found to have had a true value,
for the purposes of
s 272(1)(a), that is 82.5 per cent of the average retail price for that type of
vehicle at that time;
(2) the average retail price for the particular vehicle is calculated using the
steps described above (at [
(3) in order to aggregate the effect, across the full
cohort of Relevant Vehicles, of applying the points of comparison required by
272(1)(a), the Court can rely on Mr Stockton’s calculations pursuant to
what he describes as the “‘lower of’
construct” –
a pricing construct that he developed: First Stockton Report (at
[63]–[64]). This is an average for
each model and build year, calculated
based on a constituency comprising prices paid that were lower than the average
price for that
model and build year, and otherwise the average price where the
actual price exceeded the average: First Stockton Report (at [63]–[64]).
In other words, Mr Stockton’s “‘lower of’
discount” provides some indication of how far, on average,
actual purchase
prices were below the average retail price for each model and build year.
439 Using these integers, the recoverable reduction in value for each
Relevant Vehicle (other than the 2020 Field Fix vehicles) is
calculated by: (1) multiplying 17.5 per cent by the relevant average retail
price applicable to each vehicle; and (2)
deducting the difference between the
average retail price and the “lower of” retail price for that
vehicle. The aggregate
recoverable reduction in value is then calculated as the
sum of each recoverable reduction in value amount for each Relevant Vehicle
r than 2020 Field Fix vehicles).
440 It is said that the aggregate reduction in value amount will be able to
be calculated using this methodology for group members
(other than the 2020
Field Fix group members and those who have opted out) upon TMCA providing
updated information (current as at
the date of judgment) in respect of the
number of Relevant Vehicles which have (at that time) received the 2020 Field
in respect of which refunds or replacement vehicles have been
provided through TMCA’s consumer redress programme. The effect
Stockton’s calculations is that this would equate to the amounts awarded
in total in respect of all of the Relevant Vehicles
if the formula above was
applied for each of those Relevant Vehicles individually.
441 Putting to one side issues concerning the interpretation of
“reasonably accurate”, there is a central flaw in the
applicants’ proposal for the assessment of damages under s 33Z(1)(f): that
is, the method of calculation proposed. It is clear
that s 272 provides two
alternative bases upon which the calculation for damages is to be assessed,
namely, any reduction in value
below the lower of: (i) the price paid or payable
by the consumer for the goods; or (ii) the average retail price of the goods at
the time of supply. The insuperable difficulty is that Mr Stockton’s
calculation cuts across these statutory concepts, and
instead proposes a proxy
for this statutory exercise: T506.1–2.
442 The applicants accept that “to get to the [s 33Z(1)(f)] point, you
do need to cut through the statutory comparator”
(T573.6–7) but
submit that one must appreciate the broad terms of s 33Z before discounting this
methodology. In support of
this contention, reliance is placed on the Australian
Law Reform Commission (
) Report that prompted the introduction of
Part IVA: see
Grouped Proceedings in the Federal Court
(Report No 46,
1988). Notably, it is said that the ALRC recognised (at [224]–[226]) that
there could be a number of situations
in representative proceedings where it may
be appropriate to determine an aggregate quantum without specifying individual
one such example being where wrongful conduct affects market price. The
ALRC also observed (at [227]–[228]) that the aggregate
damages assessment
had the advantage of reducing costs to the parties and the administration of
justice and that the risk of inaccuracy
that arises from having to estimate
aggregate damages was not itself a ground for objecting to aggregate assessment,
because assessing
damages often involves estimation.
443 But despite the imaginative attempts of counsel for the applicant to
navigate this issue, it was recognised that the s 33Z(1)(f)
case had its flaws.
This was for good reason. While it may be readily accepted that the purpose of s
33Z is to allow a broad-brush
approach to the assessment of aggregate damages,
it cannot be the case that a general provision such as s 33Z of the Act can
the specific terms of s 272 of the ACL, which creates the entitlement
to statutory compensation. This is simply a reflection of the
construction
generalia specialibus non derogant
(general provisions do
not override specific ones), which not only applies internally to statutes, but
across statutes. Indeed, while
the proxy contended for by the applicants may
provide a convenient short cut to the question of aggregate damages, it
the text and statutory purpose of s 272 of the ACL. The s 33Z(1)(f)
claim must be rejected.
444 Turning to the alternative way in which the claim for aggregate damages
is advanced, as outlined above, s 33Z(1)(e) allows the
Court to make an award of
damages for group members consisting of specified amounts or amounts worked out
in such manner as the Court
445 In order to make a damages award of this kind, the Court need only be
satisfied, in accordance with the general damages principles
described above,
that the proposed methodology would sufficiently approximate the reduction in
value of the Relevant Vehicles resulting
from the Core Defect as at the date of
acquisition. Indeed, contrary to what is said by TMCA, it is not the case that
such orders
“must be precise” and that s 33Z(1)(e) does not
accommodate estimates or approximations. While the formula, methodology,
specific amount must be clear (that is, an actual figure) so it can be
implemented, there is nothing in the text of s 33Z(1)(e)
to indicate that
the Court must arrive at such orders or specific amounts based on precision.
Absent clear words, the provision should
not be construed as departing from the
general damages principles described above (at [
]), which permit reasonable estimates
or approximations: see
HTW Valuers
(at 663 [50]). This is distinct from
the situation of attempting to value loss in respect of the Partial Period Group
Members where,
in the absence of evidence, the exercise is speculative.
446 For the reasons described in Sections E.2.2 and E.2.3, the evidence
adduced provides a basis for the Court to make an award of
aggregate damages
pursuant to s 33Z(1)(e) in respect of group members other than 2020 Field
Fix Group Members and the Partial Period
Group Members. In summary, the damages
methodology for which the applicants contend, and I accept, should form the
basis of such
an award, and has following key integers:
(1) a reduction in value percentage of 17.5 per cent, meaning each of the
Relevant Vehicles should be found to have had a true value,
for the purposes of
s 272(1)(a), that is 82.5 per cent of the average retail price for that type of
vehicle at that time;
(2) the average retail price for the particular vehicle is calculated using the
steps described above (at [
(3) for each Relevant Vehicle, it is necessary to
determine whether the price that was in fact paid for that vehicle is lower than
the average retail price for that type of vehicle at that time. Whichever of
those measures is lower is the applicable comparator
in that particular case;
(4) in any given case, the difference between the true value of that defective
vehicle (as calculated in (1)) and the applicable
comparator in that particular
case (as determined in (3)) is the amount recoverable under s 272(1)(a) in
respect of that vehicle.
447 In order to apply the above formula or methodology to each Relevant
Vehicle held during the Relevant Period, the only additional
input that is
required in respect of each claim is the actual purchase price of the vehicle
when purchased. TMCA appears to suggest
that because this information is
presently unknown, it is an obstacle to making an order under s 33Z(1)(e).
This assertion should
be rejected – the information is ascertainable. This
methodology is appropriate as it is consistent with the formula prescribed
s 272(1)(a) and, unlike the s 33Z(1)(f) case, can be applied accurately to
each group member who is entitled to reduction in value
E.2.4 Income tax consequences for group members of a damages
is also necessary to deal with TMCA’s contention that some group members
may have subsidised a portion of their reduction
in value loss by claiming
income tax deductions for the depreciation of their Relevant Vehicle. TMCA
asserts that the damages award
for such group members should be reduced to the
extent that the reduction in value of their Relevant Vehicles was offset by the
of income tax they saved through claiming a deduction. TMCA also appears
to rely on this factor as a reason to avoid an award of
damages on a common
449 This issue can be put to one side. Group members who claimed tax
deductions for depreciation would need to declare any reduction
damages, and would need to pay income tax on those damages. Hence, unless those
group members receive an award of damages
for the full amount of the reduction
in value of their Relevant Vehicle, they would be undercompensated. Put another
way, the income
tax they pay on their reduction in value damages would exceed
any previous tax benefit received through depreciation deductions unless
damages award matches the reduction in value suffered. Accordingly, they should
be awarded the full amount of the reduction in
value of their Relevant Vehicle
with no deduction on account of income tax not paid.
450 The reason why group members who claimed tax deductions for depreciation
of their Relevant Vehicle will have to pay income tax
on their reduction in
value damages can be stated shortly:
(1) under the
Income Tax Assessment Act 1997
“recoupment” of a loss or outgoing includes “any kind of
recoupment, reimbursement, refund, insurance, indemnity
or recovery, however
described” (s 20-
(1)(a)) and a “grant in respect of the loss or
outgoing” (s 20-
(2) an amount that a taxpayer receives as a recoupment of a loss or outgoing for
which the taxpayer previously had claimed a deduction,
or can claim a deduction,
under a provision listed in s 20-30(1) is an “assessable
recoupment” that must be included
in the taxpayer’s assessable
income (s 20-20(3)).
(3) a deduction claimed for depreciation of a motor vehicle is one that can be
claimed under Div 40, which is listed at item 1.9
in the table in
s 20-30(1); and
(4) accordingly, group members who claimed a depreciation deduction on a
Relevant Vehicle will be required to include their reduction
in value damages
award as part of their assessable income, and incur income tax on that amount.
451 TMCA does not dispute this construction of the ITAA. Rather, the quarrel
seems to be that the damages award in favour of some
group members may need to
be adjusted, because it is possible that some group members may not be subject
to the same tax rate as
they were when the deduction was claimed.
452 This submission is inconsistent with principle and should be rejected.
, TMCA cites no relevant authority for its contention that
the ordinary way that a Court would address this issue is to make an adjustment
to the damages award so that the claimant does not receive a benefit.
454 The authorities establish that a damages award only needs to be reduced
on account of tax that the claimant otherwise would have
paid had the claimant
received the amount at the original time if two conditions are met. The
is that the amounts for the loss in respect of which damages are
awarded would, if they had been received by the claimant, have been
tax, and the
is that the damages awarded to the claimant would not
be subject to tax: see
Air Express Ltd v Ansett Transport Industries
(Operations) Pty Ltd
[1981] HCA 75
(1979) 146 CLR 249
(at 302 per Aickin J). This is the
British Transport Commission v Gourley
[1955] UKHL 4
[1956] AC 185.
condition is not met in this case, because it is common ground that group
members will have to pay tax on their share
of the damages award. This is
sufficient for dismissing TMCA’s contention, and demonstrates why the rule
Gourley’s Case
does not apply.
, in circumstances where it is theoretically possible but
uncertain that some group members might pay less tax on their damages award
the tax benefit they previously received, the appropriate course is to award
damages without any adjustment for tax. At least
two matters support this
conclusion. One is that if damages awards are made on a gross basis, it
conveniently leaves it to the legislature
to determine what tax should in fact
be exacted. Another is that it avoids the wrongdoer receiving a windfall.
456 Indeed, in
Atlas Tiles Ltd v Briers
[1978] HCA 37
(1978) 144 CLR 202
Gibbs J said that the rule in
Gourley’s Case
does not apply even
where “the tax payable on the award were considerably less than the
notional tax on the lost earnings”.
That is, the mere fact that a
claimant’s marginal tax rate may differ by the time they receive the
damages award does not mean
the damages award should be adjusted for that
difference. By contrast, if only a
proportion of the award would be
subject to income tax (as it was in
, being confined to 5 per cent),
the rule would apply such that damages would be calculated on a net basis but
adjusted for the proportion
of the award that will bear tax. This reasoning was
accepted in
Cullen v Trappell
[1980] HCA 10
(1980) 146 CLR 1
(at 11 per Gibbs J, with
whom Stephen J agreed at 24, Mason J agreed at 24, and Wilson J agreed at 39).
457 The authorities cited by TMCA do not gainsay these propositions or the
reasoning in
458 In the first authority that TMCA cites –
Davinski Nominees Pty
Ltd v I & A Bowler Holdings Pty Ltd & Ors
[2011] VSC 220
Kaye J applied the reasoning of Gibbs J in
(at [46]–[52] in
particular). The reason why his Honour adjusted the damages award for taxation
was because it would be subject
taxation regime from that
which would have applied to the lost income, not merely lower taxation rates:
see [76]–[77]. In
Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v
Hall Creek Coal Pty Ltd
[2016] FCA 1032
, which TMCA also cites, the issue
was whether the applicant could receive
than the gross amount of
lost income on the basis that his income tax rate now would be 40 per cent, an
increase from the rate at
the time (30 per cent). Reeves J “grossed
up” the award to reflect the additional tax liability (at [64]). This is
to the position in this case, where there is no suggestion that the
relevant income tax regime has changed, or that the damages award
subject to a different taxation regime.
Daniels v Anderson
(1995) 37 NSWLR 438
, also relied on by TMCA,
the issue before the New South Wales Court of Appeal was whether the damages
award should be reduced to
take into account the financial benefit to the
claimant, namely the rate of company tax having decreased. Clarke and Sheller
held that this should not be taken into account, and that the award should
not be reduced on account of such taxation implications.
Relevantly, their
Honours said (at 586):
The need after judgment for inquiry about the consequences of the changed rate
of company tax is a telling indicator that they are
too remote to be taken into
account ... In most cases if damages to be awarded to a plaintiff are taxable,
taxation should not be
taken into account in their assessment. There may be
exceptions, but this case is not one.
460 This supports the proposition advanced by the applicants, not the
position advanced by TMCA.
E.2.5 Conclusion on whether group members are entitled to
damages under s 272(1)(a)
follows from the above analysis that group members other than 2020 Field Fix
Group Members and the Partial Period Group Members
are entitled to recover
damages at this time under s 272(1)(a) if their Relevant Vehicles suffered
a reduction in value resulting
from the Core Defect as at the date of
acquisition.
E.3 Other loss and damage
462 In addition to
seeking damages under s 272(1)(a) for some group members, the applicants
seek damages on behalf of
group members for the excess GST they
incurred as derivative of the reduction in value of the Relevant Vehicles
resulting from the
non-compliance with s 54 of the ACL (that is, including
the 2020 Field Fix Group Members). This kind of damage is sought under
272(1)(b) of the ACL, which entitles affected persons to damages for
certain consequential losses.
463 I should note from the outset, that the reason the GST damages are sought
on behalf of all group members (including the 2020 Field
Fix Group Members), is
because it is said that a damages award under s 272(1)(b), unlike s 272(1)(a),
is unconstrained by
sFor similar reasons as expressed at [
], I accept this submission.
464 In addressing the claim for GST damages, it is necessary first to address
two contested questions of principle:
, the proper construction of s
272(1)(b) of the ACL; and
, whether group members who claimed
input tax credits would be required to account to the Australian Taxation Office
) for damages received referable to excess GST. Following this I will
turn to consider whether group members are entitled to damages
272(1)(b), and if so, whether this should be awarded on an aggregate basis.
E.3.1 The proper construction of s 272(1)(b)
465 Section 272
relevantly provides:
272 Damages that may be recovered by action against manufacturers of
(1) In an action for damages under this Division, an affected person in
relation to goods is entitled to recover damages for:
(b) any loss or damage suffered by the affected person because of the failure
to comply with the guarantee to which the action relates
if it was reasonably
foreseeable that the affected person would suffer such loss or damage as a
result of such a failure.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1)(b), the cost of inspecting and
returning the goods to the manufacturer is taken to be a reasonably
foreseeable
loss suffered by the affected person as a result of the failure to comply with
the guarantee.
(3) Subsection (1)(b) does not apply to loss or damage suffered through a
reduction in the value of the goods.
466 The s 272(1)(b) limb resembles the second component of compensatory
damages available at common law for breach of contract. That
is, the requirement
of reasonable foreseeability in s 272(1)(b) resembles the second limb of the
Hadley v Baxendale
(1854) 9 Ex 341:
Moore v Scenic Tours
[2020] HCA 17
(2020) 268 CLR 326
(at 348–349 [63]–[67]
per Edelman J, speaking in respect of the similar provision in s 267(4) of the
(at 435 [891]). This suggests that the purpose of an award of
damages under s 272(1)(b) is to put the affected person in the position
would have been in had the goods been of acceptable quality at the time of
(at 435 [891]).
467 In this proceeding, the applicants allege that the Relevant Vehicles were
worth less than what group members paid for them because
they contained the Core

ways in which this situation could be viewed, each leading to opposite
conclusions
on whether excess taxes are derivative of the reduction in value and
therefore recoverable.
view characterises the situation as an
“overpayment” at the point of supply (at 435–436 [892]). In
this scenario,
the purpose of reduction in value damages would be to put group
members in the position they would have been in had they paid what
their vehicle
was worth (that is, purchase price less reduction in value). If so, it logically
follows that any taxes levied on the
“overpayment” portion of the
purchase price are reasonably foreseeable consequential losses that ought to be
(at 435–436 [892], 439 [911]–[912]). The
view characterises the situation as an
“under-delivery” at the point of supply (at 435–436 [892]). In
this scenario,
the purpose of reduction in value damages would be to put group
members in the position they would have been in had they received
worth what they paid (that is, a non-defective vehicle). It follows that once
compensated for the reduction in value, there
is no need to refund excess
derivative taxes, because group members would have paid the correct amounts of
tax on their purchase:
(at 435–436 [892], 439 [911]).
, Perram J concluded (at 439 [912]) that the first view
(the overpayment characterisation) was correct, because it best accords with
logic and principle. That is, once an affected person recovers reduction in
value damages, their position becomes akin to having
paid what the vehicle was
worth. In that position, they should not have paid the taxes that were levied on
the overpayment portion
of the purchase price. The applicants contend that this
reasoning is correct, and applies with equal force to the excess GST that
members paid on the overpayment referable to the reduction in value of their
Relevant Vehicles resulting from the Core Defect.
In the applicants’
submission, group members overpaid by the reduction in value amount, and this
necessarily entailed that
they paid an additional 10 per cent of that amount as
GST which they are entitled to recover under s 272(1)(b).
470 TMCA mounts two arguments to the contrary.
, TMCA contends that Mr Stockton’s Repair Cost Model
evidence does not accord with the “overpayment” approach preferred
. To the extent this is relevant, this is incorrect. Mr Stockton
expressly characterises the reduction in value loss suffered by group
an “overpayment”: First Stockton Report (at [37], [47], [90]).
Further, he describes the Repair Cost Model
as estimating a “direct
incremental Reduction in Value or Overpayment”: First Stockton Report (at
[42]). This follows
from the fact that the repair “represents an
observable and measurable increment by which to assess the degree to which the
Affected Vehicles were less valuable at the point of acquisition”: First
Stockton Report (at [41]). To my mind, there is nothing
inconsistent between
describing the repair cost as the amount necessary to return a vehicle to the
bargained-for position and describing
it as an overpayment: Second Stockton
Report (at [44]). It reflects the same concept, namely that, if the repair cost
differentiates
in monetary terms the defective vehicle from its bargained for
state, the vehicle actually delivered was worth less than what was
(at 439 [913]–[914]), Perram J
also considered and rejected an argument that damages arising from the payment
of excess GST
could not be recovered under s 272(1)(b) because of s 272(3).
Relevantly, his Honour stated that in order to fall within s 272(3),
... must be ‘suffered through’ the reduction in the value of the
goods. The fact that the imposts and financing costs
were paid on the purchase
price rather than on the true value of the vehicle makes it difficult to see how
they were ‘suffered
through’ the reduction in value. ‘Suffered
through’ is an expression which connotes a relationship of causation.
most contexts, there is more to causation than satisfaction of the ‘but
for’ test. And, as has often been pointed
out, where there are two
sufficient causes (A and B) for an event C, the application of the but for test
leads to the anomalous result
that neither A nor B is causative of C. Even so, I
think it is instructive in this case that the excess GST, stamp duty and
costs would still have been incurred if there had not been a reduction
in the value of [the applicant’s] vehicle. That is a
further reason for
concluding that they have not been ‘suffered through’ the reduction
in value for the purposes of s
473 TMCA submits that Perram J’s reasoning is erroneous and should not
be followed. It is said that if, on the assumption given
by his Honour, Mrs
Capic did not prove any reduction in value, it is correct that she still would
have paid GST (and stamp duty and
financing costs), but the difference is that
no part of those amounts could have been said to have been an overpayment or a
made in error. In TMCA’s submission, Mrs Capic’s claim could
not have succeeded. Indeed, it is said that the claim is
wholly derivative and,
for that reason, is “suffered through” a reduction in the value of
474 I am inclined to disagree, and in any event, I am far from reaching the
level of satisfaction to conclude that Perram J’s
analysis is plainly
wrong. It is certainly arguable that payment of excess GST is not a loss that is
“suffered through”
a reduction in value, particularly when it would
have been paid in any event had there not been a reduction in value. More to the
point, if TMCA’s contention was correct, it would mean that excess taxes
that are derivative of the overpayment embodied in
a reduction in value could
not be recovered. This is because the payment of an excess tax is not a
reduction in value of the goods,
so it is not recoverable under
s 272(1)(a). It follows that it must surely be a consequential loss to
which s 272(1)(b) applies.
Indeed, it would be passing strange if
Parliament intended for a loss which was reasonably foreseeable to be left out
of s 272(1)(a)
and (b). As Mr Free SC, senior counsel for the applicants
put it, there is not “some third category of just irrecoverable
T573.42–46.
E.3.2 GST consequences for group members of a damages
contends that it is likely that some group members would not be entitled to
recover excess GST, because if a group member
claimed an input tax credit for
the GST they paid on their Relevant Vehicle, that group member suffered no
excess GST loss.
476 Like the issue of income tax deductions for depreciation, this issue is a
distraction and can be put to one side. This is because
group members who were
registered for GST and claimed an input tax credit for the GST paid on their
Relevant Vehicle would need to
make an increasing adjustment in their Business
Activity Statement (
) if they receive reduction in value damages. In
doing so, they would need to treat the reduction in value damages as a reduction
in the consideration they paid for the vehicle, which necessarily would oblige
them to refund the GST portion of that reduction to
the ATO. Accordingly, unless
those group members receive an award of damages that includes the excess GST
they paid on the reduction
in value of their Relevant Vehicle, they would remain
out of pocket. Put another way, unless TMCA pays the group members the excess
GST, they would only be able to keep 10/11ths of their reduction in value
damages, and would not be fully compensated.
477 The underlying reasoning for this conclusion may be mapped as
478 The payment of GST is regulated by the
A New Tax System (Goods and
Services Tax) Act 1999
). Section 19-70(1) of the
GST Act provides that a GST registered group member would need to make an
“adjustment” in their
BAS for an acquisition for which they are
entitled to an input tax credit if:
(1) in relation to the acquisition, one or more adjustment events occur
during a tax period (s 19-70(1)(a)); and
(2) an input tax credit on the acquisition was attributable to an earlier tax
period (or, if the acquisition was not a creditable
acquisition, would have been
attributable to an earlier tax period had the acquisition been a creditable
acquisition) (s 19-70(1)(b));
(3) as a result of those adjustment events, the previously attributed input
tax credit amount for the acquisition (if any) no longer
correctly reflects the
amount of the input tax credit (if any) on the acquisition (s 19-70(1)(c)) (the
corrected input tax credit amount
479 Relevant to this case, an “adjustment event” would include
any event which has the effect of “changing the consideration
for a supply
or acquisition”: s 19-10(1)(b) of the GST Act. In particular,
s 19-10(2)(b) provides that “a change to the
previously agreed
consideration for a supply or acquisition, whether due to the offer of a
discount or otherwise” is an adjustment
480 The key issue is whether receiving reduction in value damages under
s 272(1)(a) of the ACL amounts to a change in the consideration
paid by the
group member for the acquisition of their Relevant Vehicle. If it does, an
adjustment event has occurred.
481 I accept, as the applicants contend, that the receipt of a reduction in
value damages award would create an adjustment event for
the group member,
because the concept of “consideration” is broadly defined.
Specifically, s 195-1 (the Dictionary) defines
“consideration”
as meaning that which is given by ss 9‑15 and 9‑17. Relevantly,
s 9-15 provides:
9-15 Consideration
Consideration
(a) any payment, or any act or forbearance, in connection with a supply of
anything; and
(b) any payment, or any act or forbearance, in response to or for the
inducement of a supply of anything.
(2A) It does not matter:
(a) whether the payment, act or forbearance was in compliance with an order of
a court, or of a tribunal or other body that has
the power to make orders; ...
482 The phrase “in connection with a supply” is sufficiently
broad to encompass a damages award that is referable to an
overpayment, because
such damages would represent a change in the requisite payment for the supply.
This is particularly so given
that s 9-15(2A) makes plain that a damages
award can be regarded as consideration for an acquisition.
483 Further, in the context of s 9-5(a), which defines a “taxable
supply” as a “supply
consideration” (emphasis
added). Gummow, Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ in
Federal Commissioner of Taxation
v Qantas Airways Ltd
[2012] HCA 41
(2012) 247 CLR 286
explained (at 292
[14]) that the phrase “for consideration” simply “requires a
connection or relationship between
the supply and the consideration”. A
reduction in value damages award – which in substance refunds an
overpayment for
a good – has that connexion or relationship to the
original supply of the good. As such, it amounts to a change in the
consideration
for the original acquisition.
484 The implication for group members who previously claimed an input tax
credit for the GST they paid on acquiring their Relevant
Vehicle is that the
reduction in value damages they receive under s 272(1)(a) have the effect of
reducing the consideration they
paid. This means that the input tax credit they
previously claimed will be greater than the input tax credit to which they are
on the reduced consideration.
485 The ultimate result under s 19-80 of the GST Act is that group
members will have an “increasing adjustment” to make,
equal to the
difference between the corrected tax input credit amount and the previously
attributed input tax credit amount. This
will need to be refunded to the ATO in
their BAS: see also the examples provided in the Australian Taxation
Office’s Goods
and Services Tax Ruling 2001/4:
Goods and services tax:
GST consequences of court orders and out-of-court settlements
(GSTR 2001/4,
20 June 2001) (at [123]–[125]).
486 In opening submissions, TMCA accepted that group members would need to
make an increasing adjustment to their BAS if they received
a further payment
that changed the consideration for the supply or acquisition. It now contends
that a damages award paid by TMCA
would not be “in connection with”
the acquisition of the Relevant Vehicle (in the sense that it reduces the
consideration
paid), because TMCA was not the supplier of the Relevant Vehicle
if the group member acquired the Relevant Vehicle from a dealer.
However, that
submission fails to grapple with the breadth and commercial substance of the
phrase “in connection with”.
The damages award in this case would be
akin to a person receiving a cashback rebate from the manufacturer upon purchase
from a dealer.
Such a payment would be made “in connection with” the
consideration for the acquisition of the Relevant Vehicle.
487 This is also made clear by Div 134 of the GST Act which relates to
“Third party payments” and provides for this particular
circumstance. Section 134-1 provides:
You may have a decreasing adjustment if you make a payment to an entity that
acquires something that you had supplied to another
receiving the payment may have an increasing adjustment.
(Emphasis added).
488 Section 134-10 concerns increasing adjustments for payments received by
third parties, and relevantly provides:
(1) You have an
increasing adjustment
(a) you receive a payment from an entity (the
) that supplied
a thing that you acquire from another entity (whether or not that other entity
acquired the thing from the payer);
(b) your acquisition of the thing from the other entity:
(i) was a creditable acquisition; or
(ii) would have been a creditable acquisition but for a reason to which
subsection (3) applies; and
(c) the payment is one or more of the following forms:
(i) payment of money or digital currency;
(ii) an offset of an amount of money or digital currency that you owe to the
(ii) a crediting of an amount of money or digital currency to an account that
you hold; and
the payment is made in connection with, in response to or for the
inducement of your acquisition of the thing;
(e) the payment is not consideration for a supply you make.
(Emphasis added).
489 To the extent a group member acquired their Relevant Vehicle from a
dealer, any damages payment by TMCA would be in connexion
with the group
member’s acquisition of a Relevant Vehicle that TMCA supplied, and that
the group member acquired from another
entity. This would be so whether the
Relevant Vehicle was new or used. Therefore, the group member would have an
increasing adjustment,
even if they purchased their Relevant Vehicle from a
dealer, not TMCA.
490 Finally, I should note that there is also no applicable time limit that
would preclude a group member from being obliged to make
this increasing
adjustment. Pursuant to s 29-20(1) of the GST Act, the adjustment that a group
member would need to make would be
attributed to the tax period when they become
aware of the adjustment. The adjustment is included in their BAS for the period
which they receive the damages.
491 Accordingly, this issue can be put to one side, because it does not
affect the amount of any group member’s loss. Most relevantly,
it is not a
logical reason to refrain from awarding damages to any group member in respect
of GST that has been overpaid as a result
of the overpayment in respect of the
Relevant Vehicles.
E.3.3 Whether group members are entitled to damages under
s 272(1)(b)
I am satisfied there was a reduction in value of the Relevant Vehicles of 17.5
per cent resulting from the failure to comply
with s 54 of the ACL, it
follows from what I have explained above that group members are entitled to
recover the excess GST they
paid on that reduction in value. The GST damages are
to be calculated as 10 per cent of the reduction in value.
493 The complication is whether such damages should be awarded on an
aggregate basis and to whom. Given GST damages are derivative
of the reduction
in value of the Relevant Vehicles, consistently with my findings above, the
appropriate course is to award such
damages on an aggregate basis under s
33Z(1)(e) of the Act. The only group members who I am not satisfied should be
awarded GST damages
at this stage, for the same reasons I expressed in relation
to reduction in value damages, are the Partial Period Group Members.
Field Fix Group Members are, however, entitled to GST damages.
E.4 Pre-judgment interest
accordance with s 51A of the Act, group members are entitled to pre-judgment
interest on any reduction in value and GST damages
award. This is not disputed
by TMCA. There is no reason why the award of pre-judgment interest should not
also be made on an aggregate
basis pursuant to s 33Z(1)(e) to the relevant group
members entitled.
E.5 Duty to mitigate
alleges that the applicants and group members:
, had a duty to
mitigate their claimed losses; and
, failed to mitigate their
losses by failing to cause TMCA to repair their Relevant Vehicles under their
express warranties. Although
not expressly pleaded, it may be inferred that TMCA
also contends that any damages to be awarded should be reduced on account of
such failure.
496 This submission as to “mitigation”
is based on TMCA’s assertion that where a claimant is otherwise entitled
to recover damages for misleading or deceptive conduct, any damages award may be
reduced by reason of the claimant’s failure
to mitigate, that is, to take
reasonable steps to reduce the losses arising from the misleading or deceptive
497 But a point should be made at the outset: in a statutory cause of action,
speaking of a “duty to mitigate”, a concept
drawn from the common
law, is apt to distract from the required statutory task. Contrary to
TMCA’s submissions, the common
law duty to mitigate has no role to play in
an action for compensation under statute: see, analogously,
Trilogy Funds
Management Ltd v Sullivan (No 2)
[2015] FCA 1452
(2015) 331 ALR 185
330–331 [712]–[716] per Wigney J and the authorities cited by his
Honour). To the contrary, in
Henville v Walker
, McHugh J said in respect
of ss 53 and 82 of the TPA (at 505 [140]) that:
Nothing in the common law, in s 52 or s 82 or in the policy
of the [TPA] supports the conclusion that a claimant’s damages
should be reduced because the loss or damage could have been avoided by the
exercise of reasonable care on the claimant’s
498 Having said this, in respect of statutory compensation, the basal notion
called in aid by TMCA arises from the statutory requirement
of necessary
connexion or causation, that is, that damage be caused “by” the
conduct of the defendant:
Henville v Walker
(at 505 [140] per McHugh J);
Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd
[2001] FCA 500
(2001) 112 FCR 182
(at 197–198 [47] per Branson J);
Murphy v Overton Investments Pty
[2004] HCA 3
(2004) 216 CLR 388
(at 414 [68] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh,
Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ).
499 In the present case, the same requirement arises from the statutory
language of ss 236 and 272 of the ACL: in ss 236 and 272(1)(b)
it arises by
reason of the words “because of”; and in s 272(1)(a) it arises
by reason of the words “resulting from”.
It is said that both forms
of statutory wording identify the need for the claimed loss to result from the
statutory contravention,
and where a claimant fails to take reasonable steps to
reduce such losses, the damages that would have been avoided by those steps
not recoverable.
500 TMCA submits that these principles apply in the present proceeding in
respect of group members who have not taken advantage of
the 2020 Field Fix.
Relevantly, it is said that:
(1) TMCA gave express warranties to all group members with respect to their
vehicles. There were two sets of warranties – the
New Vehicle Warranty and
the Toyota Warranty Advantage. The parties agree those documents are
representative of the warranties provided
to purchasers of new vehicles
throughout the Relevant Period (SAF [9]–[10]); and
(2) in August 2020, TMCA sent letters to group members who owned Pre-MY2018
Production Vehicles which extended the warranties so
as to apply to DPF repairs
for 10 years from delivery of the vehicle. That letter provided links to a
webpage and booklet with information
members to contact their dealers, stating: “[i]f required, they will
] a replacement system that incorporates changes made to
address the operational issues that some guests have experiences [
... at no cost to you.” (AF [178](c)–(d)]).
501 TMCA asserts it made it known to group members that they were able to
have the defect repaired at no cost to them and group members
who have not taken
up that offer have behaved unreasonably such that they should not be compensated
for loss attributable to that
unreasonable behaviour. It is said that because
the 2020 Field Fix removed the defect it also eliminated any reduction in value
that group members are
prima facie
not entitled to any damages for
loss in value at all. Alternatively, it is said that if the Court found that a
loss of value arises
from the use of the vehicles prior to August 2020, there
would need to be a proportionate reduction in damages by reference to the
fraction of the vehicle’s working life constituted by the period between
purchase and August 2020.
502 Irrespective of the precise words of statutory causation, it must be
right that if part of the loss would not have occurred but
applicant’s own unreasonable conduct, it is reasonable for the Court to
consider how much of the loss was caused by
the contravening conduct and to
award damages accordingly. But such a concept does not apply on the facts of
this case, where TMCA
relies upon the failure by group members to take advantage
of a repair – the 2020 Field Fix – years after they purchased
Relevant Vehicle. This is because there can be no suggestion that the failure to
take up the repair
any part of a group member’s reduction in
value loss, when that loss resulted from the presence of the Core Defect at the
of acquisition, before the 2020 Field Fix was available. Nor do I accept
TMCA’s assertion that the loss suffered by group members
could have been
cured by taking up the 2020 Field Fix. The fix cannot change the historical fact
that at the time of supply each
Relevant Vehicle was not of acceptable quality
and was less valuable as a result.
503 This analysis is also supported by the scheme provided for under ss 271
and 272 of the ACL. The notion that where a manufacturer
of goods offers to
remedy defective goods under an express warranty, and the consumer of the goods
does not take up that offer, the
consumer has failed to mitigate its loss, such
that its “reduction in value” damages are nil is incompatible with
statutory regime.
504 Section 271(6) deals specifically with the circumstance of repairs under
warranty. It provides:
(6) If an affected person in relation to goods has, in accordance with an
express warranty given or made by the manufacturer of the
goods, required the
manufacturer to remedy a failure to comply with a guarantee referred to in
subsection (1), (3) or (5):
(a) by repairing the goods; or
(b) by replacing the goods with goods of an identical type;
then, despite that subsection, the affected person is not entitled to commence
an action under that subsection to recover damages
of a kind referred to in
section 272(1)(a) unless the manufacturer has refused or failed to remedy the
failure, or has failed to
remedy the failure within a reasonable time.
505 The proper construction of s 271(6) of the ACL was considered at length
(at 392–402 [694]–[740]). There is nothing in s
271(6) that
a consumer to request that their goods be repaired
under warranty, where an effective repair is available: see
398–399 [717]–[723]). Rather, the consumer may make an election
between requiring the manufacturer to repair their
goods, or bringing an action
against the manufacturer for damages of the kind described in s
As Perram J explained in
(at 399 [719]):
The operation of s 271(6) (and s 271(1)) is that one cannot get the benefit of
repair or replacement of goods under an express warranty
and then, having done
so, sue for damages on the very defect which has been remedied. It is one or it
is the other. But that dichotomy
is mute when there is no express warranty in
the first place
or, even where there is, where the consumer has not exercised
his or her rights under it. This conclusion springs from common sense
from the fact that the provision begins with the word ‘if’
combined with the unavoidable fact that one cannot extract from a statement
in the form ‘If A then B’ the proposition
(Emphasis added).
506 Indeed, his Honour rejected the argument that the ACL, and specifically
Pt 5-4 Div 2 (in which ss 271 and 272 appear) “in
general abhors the
consumer seeking compensation as a first step”:
[720]). Reading into the statutory regime an
upon the consumer
to “mitigate” its loss by requiring the manufacturer to repair goods
under warranty would do violence
to the statutory scheme embodied in Pt 5-4 Div
2 of the ACL.
507 Accordingly, neither ss 271 nor 272 of the ACL, properly construed,
impose upon consumers a so-called duty to mitigate of the
kind for which TMCA
contends (or, more relevantly, impact upon the quantum of casually related loss
as TMCA contends).
508 In any event, even assuming that there was some obligation to
“mitigate” damage, it cannot sensibly be said that a
failure to take
up the invitation to have the 2020 Field Fix applied is unreasonable in
circumstances where TMCA asserts that to
take up that invitation has the effect,
under s 271(6), of extinguishing altogether any entitlement to damages under s
TMCA submits that it is unjust for consumers to obtain monetary
damages for reduction in value instead of taking up a repair years
However, this argument misses the point, because the statutory provisions are
(at 399 [721]). In any event, the result compelled by
the statute is not unjust – a later repair does not compensate the
for having paid more than the vehicle was worth at the time of
F THE CLAIM OF DCS FOR LOSS AND DAMAGE
is then necessary to turn to the claim of DCS for loss and damage.
F.1 Acceptable quality
F.1.1 Whether there was a reduction in value of the Relevant
brings an individual claim under s 272(1)(a) of the ACL for reduction in
value damages resulting from the non-compliance with
the statutory guarantee. As
noted, it is common ground that DCS owned the vehicle and it was the party that
therefore suffered any
reduction in value loss. Given the reduction in value I
have found of 17.5 per cent is the same across all Relevant Vehicles, that
figure applies to the Relevant Prado. The way in which that percentage is
applied in order to determine the quantum of damages under
s 272(1)(a) of the
ACL is explained above: see Section E.2.3.
511 The Relevant Prado was purchased on 8 April 2016: First
Williams Affidavit (at [78]). It cost $60,315, inclusive of GST, stamp
duty, “Perfexion Window Tint 2 Windows”, dealer delivery,
registration fee and Compulsory Third Party insurance: First
Williams Affidavit (at [82]–[83]). The price exclusive of GST, stamp
duty, other statutory charges and window tint, but inclusive
of dealer delivery
which forms part of the consideration for the vehicle, was $52,214.32. Dealer
delivery should be included in the
purchase price, because it is an amount paid
for the acquisition of the vehicle itself, in contrast to a tax or other benefit
as CTP insurance or registration: see definition of “price” in
s 2(1) of the ACL. This analysis is also consistent with
the Agreed Facts,
which records the total “drive away” price, and the amount of GST
and stamp duty: AF [80]. While the
Agreed Facts does not identify the tax
exclusive purchase price without accessories, the identification of that
amount from the evidence
does not contradict the Agreed Facts.
512 There was no disclosure of the Core Defect or Defect Consequences to Mr
Williams (and hence DCS) before the Relevant Prado was
purchased: First
Williams Affidavit (at [96]–[97]). The agreed purchase price was
therefore not based on a common appreciation
of the existence of the Core
Defect. Accordingly, for the reasons described above in Sections E.2.2 and
E.2.3, the Relevant Prado
was worth less than an identical vehicle without the
Core Defect at the time of acquisition.
513 As to the amount of that reduction in value, it is necessary to descend
into an exercise of calculation. I note that all figures
are rounded to two
decimal places. The reduction in value for damages for DCS is
which is calculated by applying the following methodology derived from the
statutory formula in s 272(1)(a):
(1) the reduction in value is 17.5 per cent;
(2) the MSRP applicable to the Relevant Prado was $61,990: AF [78]. The average
retail price (excluding tax) applicable to the Relevant
Prado can be calculated
using Mr Stockton’s evidence, which identifies average purchase price as a
percentage of MSRP for each
model and time period. For the 2016 Prado, the
average purchase price was 96.23 per cent of MSRP: First Stockton Report (at tab
p 2). The formula is therefore 96.23 per cent of $61,990, divided by 1.1 (in
order to remove GST from the MSRP). This equates to
an average purchase price
for the 2016 Prado of $54,229.98;
(3) the “true” value of the Relevant Prado (that is, the value of
the goods had the existence of the Core Defect been
known at the time of
purchase) is derived by reducing the average purchase price, $54,229.98, by 17.5
per cent. This equals $44,739.73
(4) the “price paid” for the Relevant Prado, being the actual tax
exclusive purchase price paid by DCS, was $52,214.32;
(5) for the purposes of s 272(1)(a) of the ACL, in the case of the Relevant
Prado, the “lower” of the “price paid”
“average retail price” was the “price paid”; and
(6) the recoverable reduction in value, therefore, is the difference between the
“price paid” ($52,214.32) and the “true”
value of the
Relevant Prado (as reduced on account of the Core Defect ($44,739.73)); that is,
F.1.2 Whether DCS suffered other consequential loss
claims damages under s 272(1)(b) for other reasonably foreseeable loss or
damage resulting from the non-compliance with s
54 of the ACL, namely: (1)
excess GST, stamp duty and financing costs incurred because of the Core Defect;
(2) lost income on days
when Mr Williams could not work (for the benefit of DCS)
because the vehicle was being serviced due to the Core Defect; and (3) excess
fuel costs incurred because of the Core Defect.
515 I will consider each of these heads of damage in turn.
Excess GST, stamp duty and financing costs
516 For the reasons
described above (at Section E.3), the excess GST, stamp duty and financing costs
(that is, excess interest) are
all derivative of the reduction in value amount,
because this amount is akin to an overpayment at the time of acquisition. Had
paid only what the vehicle was worth, it would not have incurred these
additional amounts.
517 On the basis that the reduction in value
percentage is 17.5 per cent and that the recoverable reduction in value is
(1) the excess GST is 10 per cent of the reduction in value amount –
(2) the excess stamp duty is 3 per cent of the sum of the reduction in value
amount and the excess GST –
518 The excess financing costs are in substance
the interest paid on the additional amount borrowed because of the overpayment.
is calculated by multiplying the tax inclusive reduction in value, on a
month by month basis, using the percentage figures set out
Stockton’s excess interest amortisation schedule: Second Stockton Report
(at tab KAW 4, p 1U). I will leave it to the
parties to calculate this exact
figure, which is somewhat complex. TMCA does not dispute the arithmetic
Lost income
519 On three occasions
when the Relevant Prado had to be serviced for issues associated with its DPF
System, Mr Williams was unable
to conduct his usual work, on behalf of DCS, of
performing inspections for AAMC. This occurred on 27 April 2018, 12 April 2019
20 March 2020, causing DCS to lose, on each occasion, between $1,350 and
$1,800 (excluding GST) in revenue: First Williams Affidavit
[237]–[239]).
520 These amounts were reasonably foreseeable losses that resulted from the
failure to comply with the statutory guarantee of acceptable
quality. Indeed, it
is reasonably foreseeable that the owner of a defective vehicle will take steps
to try to have the vehicle fixed,
and that this may cause that person to lose
work opportunities as a result. Mr Williams agreed to take those bookings for a
because they were the first available dates offered, and he was
understandably frustrated with the condition of his vehicle and wanted
issues addressed as soon as possible: First Williams Affidavit (at [236]).
There was nothing put to Mr Williams in cross-examination
to suggest that it was
unreasonable for him to have taken this course.
521 The applicants submit that the Court should find that DCS suffered lost
income on each occasion in the amount of $1,575, being
the mid-point of the
range between $1,350 and $1,800, meaning the total amount recoverable under
s 272(1)(b) for lost income would
. This figure appears to
be common ground, and I accept it to be appropriate.
Excess fuel
have already determined the contest in respect of the referee’s report on
this topic, finding that the referee concluded
that there was an increase in
fuel consumption, but that he was unable to settle on a “reliable single
estimate for increased
fuel consumption to be applied globally for all Relevant
Vehicles”: see [
]. This creates
some difficulties in approaching the individual claims of group members,
including that of DCS.
523 The applicants contend that the Court should apply a 3 per cent average
increase in fuel consumption in respect of the Relevant
Prado, in the light of
the findings of the referee and Mr Williams’ evidence. While I have dealt
with the findings of the referee
on this point above, it is necessary to recall
that the referee concluded in his Second Report (at [27]):
While the simple average of the mean fuel consumption increase estimates of the
vehicles in the Toyota Fuel Consumption Study is
more than half of the
vehicles are estimated to have no more than a marginal impact on fuel
consumption
, as I expected in my earlier report. I note, however, that the
driving patterns associated with the ECM downloads and the corresponding
regeneration/non-regeneration distances reported in the TFCS are unknown and may
not be directly comparable to the driving pattern
of the NEDC used for the Fuel
Consumption values from Type Approval, adding uncertainty to the estimates.
the ECM downloads reported in the TFCS do not represent a
statistically significant sample of any vehicle type or model
(Emphasis added).
524 Further, Mr Williams’ evidence in respect of increased fuel
consumption was as follows (see First Williams Affidavit (at
[127]–[128])):
127. During this period between the 18 month/30,000 km service on 7 November
2016 and the 24 month/40,000 km service on 1 February
2017, I also started to
notice other issues with the Prado.
128. First, I noticed that the Prado was using more fuel than it had
previously. I had not previously noticed the Prado’s
fuel consumption or
looked at the average fuel consumption recorded on the vehicle’s trip
computer. However, I recall noticing
at around this time that I was having to
refuel the Prado more often than I had previously and needing to use a greater
fuel to “top up” the Prado than I had previously. I recall
checking the average fuel consumption recorded in the Prado’s
computer at around this time. I did this because I had noticed the Prado using
more fuel than it had previously. I do not specifically
recall the average fuel
consumption I observed in the Prado’s trip computer in late 2016 or early
2017. However, since this
time, I have periodically checked the average fuel
consumption recorded in the Prado’s trip computer and, to the best of my
recollection, the average fuel consumption I have observed from time to time in
the Prado’s trip computer has been in the range
of 10.5 U100 kms to 10.8
L/100 kms. I do not recall ever seeing an average fuel consumption outside this
range recorded in the Prado’s
trip computer. I have not observed any
improvement in the Prado’s fuel consumption since around the time the
Prado started
to emit white smoke.
525 Notably, Mr Williams was not challenged on this evidence, nor was this
evidence the subject of a limitation under
Evidence Act
its use to the fact of the representation not its truth).
526 TMCA submits that with respect to the referees conclusions, within those
“statistically insignificant” results, the
only Prado which was
considered by the Referee showed 0 per cent increased fuel consumption, which is
of significance given the vehicle
in question is a Prado. It is said that the
referee’s more generalised findings (based on mean values across all
cannot support a conclusion that the Relevant Prado was the subject of
any increased fuel consumption particularly in light of the
comments about the limitations of his analysis. TMCA further submits that a
failure to cross-examine Mr Williams
on his evidence in this respect, or seek a
limitation in relation to this evidence, is unimportant. That is because, even
if it could
be said the Relevant Prado did suffer an increase in fuel
consumption as a result of the Core Defect, Mr Williams’ evidence
hopelessly vague that it cannot form a rational basis upon which to reach an
affirmative state of satisfaction as to the precise
increase in fuel
consumption. Alternatively stated, on the current state of the evidence,
quantifying the increase in fuel consumption
is nothing but speculation.
527 DCS, on the other hand, submits that the parties co-operated with a view
to extracting data from the Electronic Control Unit (
) in the Relevant
Prado concerning the increased rate of active regeneration experienced by the
Relevant Prado as a result of the
Core Defect. If this data could be obtained,
it would enable the excess fuel costs to be quantified in accordance with the
methodology
endorsed by the referee, but the diagnostic analysis performed has
not been able to identify the relevant data on the ECU of the
Relevant Prado,
meaning that precise quantification of the excess fuel costs has not been
possible. In the circumstances, DCS submits
that the most appropriate course is
for the Court to assess the recoverable excess fuel costs by reference to the
findings concerning increased fuel consumption and Mr
Williams’ evidence as to the fuel costs that DCS incurred. This is an
example, it is said, of a situation “where the Court must do the best it
528 DCS submits that the fact that the only Prado in the sample of 12
vehicles in TMCA’s fuel study had 0 per cent excess fuel
consumption does
not gainsay that the Core Defect had a propensity for a negative impact on fuel
consumption in Relevant Vehicles
including the Relevant Prado, particularly in
circumstances where: (1) an owner’s driving style could affect the level
consumption (Second Referee’s Report (at [30(a)])); and (2) Mr
Williams gave unchallenged evidence that the Relevant Prado’s
consumption increased at times when it was suffering the Defect Consequences.
Indeed, senior counsel for the applicant was cautious
to emphasise that the
Prado assessed in the TFCS should not be taken to be representative of
Prado’s generally.
529 This issue has caused me some pause. On the
one hand, one must appreciate the finding of the referee that the Core Defect
an increase in fuel consumption. On the other hand, one must appreciate
the lacuna in the evidence in quantifying what this increase
in fuel consumption
is in relation to the Relevant Prado with any degree of specificity. I accept
that as a matter of logic, the
increase in fuel consumption should be assessed
as somewhere between 0 per cent and 3 per cent, and that Mr Williams’
provides a basis to infer that there was an increase in fuel
consumption. But there is simply no indication of what that increase
was. Indeed, Mr Williams’ reference to the fact he “observed from
time to time ... the Prado’s trip computer
has been in the range of 10.5
U100 kms to 10.8 L/100 kms” is hollow without a comparator figure before
the Defect Consequences
manifested. In all the circumstances, the evidence does
not allow me to reach a state of reasonable satisfaction as to the Relevant
Prado’s increase in fuel consumption caused by the Core Defect. To proceed
otherwise on the evidence adduced would be to engage
in impermissible
speculation.
530 This head of damage must fail. I stress that
this is an individual assessment in relation to DCS, and it may be that other
members are able to prove, to the relevant standard, that they suffered
loss due to increased fuel consumption.
F.2 Misleading and deceptive conduct
also seeks damages pursuant to s 236 of the ACL for the difference between the
purchase price and the true value of the Relevant
Prado as at the date of
purchase and other consequential losses (namely, the excess GST and stamp duty
paid on the overpayment at
the time of acquisition, excess financing costs, lost
income and excess fuel expenses).
532 On any view, the measure of damages in respect of the misleading and
deceptive conduct case would be the same as I have found
in respect of the
acceptable quality case. One might then sensibly ask: why is the claim for
misleading and deceptive conduct being
533 The reason advanced by the applicants relates to the interaction of the
relevant statutory provisions. Relevantly, s 236(1) of
the ACL provides:
236 Actions for damages
(a) a person (the
) suffers loss or damage because of the
conduct of another person; and
(b) the conduct contravened a provision Chapter 2 or 3;
the claimant may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against that
other person, or against any person involved in
the contravention.
534 It is said that if it is the case that s 271(6) disentitles the 2020
Field Fix Group Members to an award of reduction in value
damages pursuant to s
272(1)(a)(i) (a matter that does not currently arise for determination), the
claim for damages under s 236
is brought into sharp focus. This is because the
award of damages under s 236 is unaffected by s 271(6) or any like provision. It
is said that the case of DCS therefore provides an example of a claim for
misleading and deceptive conduct and should be determined.
Given the individual
misleading and deceptive conduct claim of DCS is pressed and could be of
utility, I propose to deal with it
notwithstanding the measure of damages is the
same as the acceptable quality case.
535 The use of the phrase “because of” indicates that the
entitlement to damages under s 236(1) is predicated on a causal
between the misleading or deceptive conduct on the one hand (which amounts to a
contravention of Chapter 2 or 3 of the
ACL) and the loss or damage suffered on
the other hand: see
Campbell v Backoffice
(at 341 [102] per Gummow,
Hayne, Heydon and Kiefel JJ).
536 The appropriate measure of damages in a claim under s 236(1)
concerning a good acquired by misrepresentation has long been said
difference between purchase price and the true value of the good as at the date
of acquisition:
Potts v Miller
(at 297–298 per Dixon J);
Pty Ltd v WG & B Pty Ltd
[1995] HCA 4
(1995) 184 CLR 281
(at 291 per Brennan, Deane,
Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ). However, this is not an inflexible rule:
(at 657 [36] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Heydon JJ).
Nor did Dixon J even suggest it was inflexible in
Potts v Miller
Court can, where appropriate, take into account subsequent events to illuminate
what the goods were worth at the date of acquisition:
Potts v Miller
HTW Valuers
(at 658–659
[39]). In doing so, the Court needs to be careful to distinguish between
possible causes of the decline in value
after the date of acquisition:
(at 659 [40]). If the cause is inherent in the thing itself, then
its existence should be taken into account in arriving at the true
value at the
time of acquisition:
Potts v Miller
HTW Valuers
[40]). However, if the cause is “independent”,
“extrinsic”, “supervening” or “accidental”,
then the additional loss is not the consequence of the misrepresentation:
Potts v Miller
HTW Valuers
(at 659 [40]).
537 Further, the Court needs to be discerning before relying on “market
values” at the time of acquisition or subsequent
to acquiring the good.
For example, it would not be appropriate to use market values as the basis for
assessing the true value as
at the time of acquisition if those market values
were infected by misinformation or were mistaken:
HTW Valuers
657–658 [37]). To the extent that TMCA seeks to rely on resale market data
in the present case, it suffers from this problem
for the reasons dealt with
above: see [
538 It is common ground that TMCA made the representations, including in
brochures such as the Toyota Prado e-Brochure printed October
2015. TMCA also
admits that it engaged in the Omissions Conduct, including failing to disclose
the Core Defect and Defect Consequences
to prospective purchasers. These
representations and omissions were misleading for the reasons described above:
see Section D.
539 Mr Williams’ evidence, summarised above (at [
]), establishes that he relied on the
Vehicle Representations, Future Vehicle Representations and the Omissions
Conduct in deciding
to cause DCS to purchase the Relevant Prado. Accordingly, I
am satisfied that TMCA’s misleading conduct has caused DCS’
reduction in value loss.
540 In addition to reduction in value damages, DCS seeks compensation for
other consequential loss, namely excess GST and stamp duty
paid on the
overpayment at the time of acquisition, excess financing costs, lost income and
excess fuel expenses. The excess tax
and financing costs have a sufficient
causal connexion with the misleading conduct because they are derivative of the
between the purchase price and the true value. Lost income also has a
sufficient causal connexion with the misleading conduct, because
those losses
would not have occurred but for that conduct. That is, but for the misleading
conduct, the Relevant Prado would not
have been purchased, so those losses would
not have been incurred. Any contention in respect of increased fuel costs runs
same difficulty I have canvassed in respect of the acceptable quality
541 Of course, it is necessary to stress that the question of reliance is an
inherently subjective matter and whether it can be made
out by group members can
only be determined on a case by case basis. Nor, even though DCS has been
successful on both fronts, can
DCS engage in an exercise of double recovery: see
G CONCLUSION AND ORDERS
542 In short, by reason
of the Core Defect, the Relevant Vehicles were worth less at the time of supply
than they would have been
worth if they were not defective. The conduct in
marketing the vehicles as being of acceptable quality was misleading. The
claim of DCS should succeed. So should the representative claims made
on behalf of group members with regard to common issues. These
conclusions
accord with what might have been thought to be the intuitive, common sense
response to the facts presented, and it is
regrettable the case has become more
complicated than it ought to have been.
543 The parties were largely in agreement as to the common questions to be
determined at the initial trial. I can see no reason why
those common questions,
and the answers to those common questions, should now not be the subject of
agreement. Accordingly, the parties
are to file an agreed minute or competing
minutes of order reflecting these reasons, in the form of answers to common
and any ancillary orders that are necessary.
544 Finally, despite my views as to length of the submissions, and whether
concessions should have reduced the ambit of the liability
dispute, I should
note that counsel and the solicitors for the parties conducted the hearing with
great efficiency, courtesy and
professionalism, which has been of great
assistance in preparing these reasons.
I certify that the preceding five-hundred-and-forty-four (544) numbered
paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment of
the Honourable Justice
