Mr Albanese MP
House of Representatives on 21 November 2016
This bill is identical to a bill introduced in the previous
Delegation of legislative power—limitations on
rule-making powers
Clause 29 provides for the making of rules (delegated legislation), which
simply states that the Minister may make rules prescribing
matters required or
permitted by this Act to be prescribed or necessary or convenient to be
prescribed to carry out or give effect
to the Act. It does not contain any of
the standard restrictions on what the rules can do, as outlined in Office of
Parliamentary
Counsel Drafting Direction 3.8:
27 If your Bill will contain a power to make instruments other than
regulations, and the instructor’s policy is that [a significant
(as described in paragraph 3 of Drafting Direction 3.8)] is not required to be
included in the instrument, you should include
the following provision:
(2) To avoid doubt, the [
name of legislative instrument e.g. rules
may not do the following:
(a) create an offence or civil penalty;
(b) provide powers of:
(i) arrest or detention; or
(ii) entry, search or seizure;
(c) impose a tax;
for Acts, but not Ordinances
] set an amount to be appropriated
from the Consolidated Revenue Fund under an appropriation in this Act;
(e) amend this [
Act/Ordinance
28 You should include this provision in this form even if not all paragraphs
are relevant to your Bill (such as because your Bill
does not contain an
appropriation).
29 Alternatively, if the instructor’s policy is that a [a significant
provision (as described in paragraph 3 of Drafting Direction
3.8)] should be
able to be dealt with by subordinate instrument, then you should include a
regulation‑making power in addition
to the instrument‑making power,
and specifically allow the regulations to provide for that kind of
As this wording includes important safeguards in relation to the use of
subordinate legislation that is not in the form of a regulation,
the committee
seeks the Member’s advice as to whether the provision can be amended so
that it aligns with the requirements
in Drafting Direction 3.8.
Pending the Member’s reply, the committee draws Senators’
attention to the provision, as it may be considered to delegate
legislative
powers inappropriately, in breach of principle 1(a)(iv) of the committee’s
terms of reference.
